My husband and I had the wonderful opportunity to travel in Europe for a month this June. The first part of the trip was in the United Kingdom (UK). Our full itinerary and information about Bath and Manchester can be found here. Today, I’m going to talk about my favorite part of the UK trip: Edinburgh, Scotland! Who wouldn’t love a country that’s made the unicorn one of its official animals?
I don’t think I’ve ever stepped foot into a country and been immediately as wowed by the architecture as I was when we first got to Edinburgh. From the train station, to the narrow streets of downtown, Edinburgh is cute, cute, cute! You have very old, windy cobblestone streets with stone buildings everywhere and, atop the dormant volcano in the center of town, a honest-to-goodness castle (Edinburgh Castle) overlooking everything. Yes, there are a lot of stairs to get from the train station to the heart of the city, but the walk is filled with wonder and beauty. And the streets really are filled with the sound of bagpipes. At least, in the tourist areas where there are plenty of street performers.
What a gorgeous place, the kind that you think of when you think of traveling in Europe.
Our AirBNB had a view of Edinburgh Castle and was quite close to the main tourist attraction, a one-mile stretch of road called “The Royal Mile”. It’s named as such because it starts at the entrance to Edinburgh Castle and finishes at Holyroodhouse Palace, the place where the royals still stay when they visit Scotland.
Along the Royal Mile, you’ll see a cathedral, churches, pubs, shops galore, an example of the “skyscrapers” they had in the 16th century, and, my favorite, the Writer’s Museum featuring three famous Scottish artists: Robert Burns, Sir Walter Scott, and Robert Louis Stevenson. We weren’t familiar with Robert Burns’ work before the visit, but he was a poet who had quite the sense of humor. Just check out his poem entitled, Address to a Haggis, and you’ll see what I mean. The Scottish seem to all have a sense of humor about things too. There were marvelous shops with clever names and pubs galore (maybe the source of the humor??).
The Royal Mile is well-worth the walk, though it gets very crowded with tourists, so it’s best to go early in the day. At the very end, near the palace, you have the Scottish parliament building and a beautiful view of Arthur’s Seat. You can climb Arthur’s Seat to get an amazing view of the city. It was quite rainy when we were visiting, so we skipped the hike, but it’ll be the first thing I do when we return.
We took a tour of Edinburgh Castle in the rain and we still had an amazing time! Our guide was fantastic and the stories behind the castle were incredibly interesting. From the castle you have a nice view of the city. Within the castle walls you can see the National War Memorial (one of the most beautiful I’ve seen), the Scottish Crown Jewels, and a plethora of rooms and museums including the room where Mary Queen of Scot gave birth to her son James and an exhibit on prisoners of war. You should purchase tickets ahead of time as I noticed a sign outside both days we were there saying the tickets were sold out for the day.
One of the top two things we did on our entire trip to Europe was to have tea at the Balmoral Hotel. Tea takes place in the incredibly fancy Palm Court complete with a harpist playing from the balcony. I have been to a lot of teas in my time, but this one is hands-down my favorite. The ambiance is just not-to-miss!
Why did we end up doing tea here instead of somewhere in London? Well, I found out that the Balmoral is where JK Rowling finished the final book in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. She was too famous to work in cafes by this point and her regular life was too distracting at home, so she upped her productivity by hiding is the Balmoral Hotel. I wanted to spend the night there, but at well over $1000/night it was quite a bit above my price range. So, we settled for tea and I am so glad we did. This was my husband’s first time having a proper afternoon tea and he loved it. I did too.
The weather all weekend was cloudy and rainy. Despite it being June, it was wet almost the whole time we were in the UK. Residents there are so sweet. We had many of them apologize for the weather (as if it’s their fault) and tell us that unfortunately this is pretty normal. We didn’t mind at all. Bad weather meant that we could spend more time inside the establishments that make Scotland famous: pubs!!
We tried to stop into as many pubs as we could, but there is a limit to how many pints a person can have in one weekend (shocking, I know). We found two favorites. First, we stopped into Cloisters Bar, which is located in an old church parsonage building. The clientele here seemed more local and the staff were quite friendly. They had a good amount of food options as well as beers.
Then, there is a the uber-touristy pub called the “Wee Pub”, the smallest pub in Scotland. It is now connected to a larger bar, Biddy Mulligan’s, but you can grab your pint and go sit in the very cute Wee Pub. Here, we met a man from London who was dog sitting for his friends and we had a very interesting conversation about American politics and perhaps the fall of our great nation into another civil war. It was incredibly eye-opening to hear what the rest of the world thinks is going to happen here in the US, I’ll tell you that.
One more word on the food in Scotland. Haggis is actually pretty good. It’s included with any Full Scottish Breakfast and we had three wonderful breakfast places right across the street from our AirBNB in the Grassmarket area. Do give it a shot!
In less than an hour after arriving, we decided to return to Scotland for a longer trip. We kept hearing about other places we’d really like to see: castles galore, Stirling’s Wallace Monument, Isle of Skye, and Loch Ness, of course. So, no doubt we’ll be back and the Highlands will certainly be on our itinerary!

Stepping off the train at Waverley Station, I was instantly enveloped by the vibrant energy of Edinburgh. The city’s majestic skyline, dominated by the imposing Edinburgh Castle perched on its rocky throne, seemed almost to greet me. My senses were immediately awakened by the eclectic mix of old and new; the historic charm of cobblestone streets interspersed with bustling modern cafes and shops. One of my most memorable moments occurred within the first hour — a bagpiper playing a soulful tune on the Royal Mile, his kilt swaying in the brisk Scottish breeze, provided the perfect welcome to this enchanting city.
First-time visitors can expect a delightful blend of history and modernity in Edinburgh. From exploring the medieval alleys of Old Town to enjoying the contemporary art in the National Galleries, there’s something for every taste and interest. The locals are warm and welcoming, ever ready to share a tale or recommend a hidden gem. What struck me the most was how seamlessly Edinburgh marries its rich past with the vibrancy of contemporary culture. While my initial expectation was a city steeped solely in history, I was pleasantly surprised by its forward-thinking spirit and lively atmosphere. Prepare to be challenged by its steep hills — but rest assured, the views from the top are absolutely worth it!
Although the post describes 10 experiences in Edinburgh, United Kingdom, you can explore 71 experiences in Edinburgh, as well as thousands of other cities across the globe on Travel Ninja. Watch the video below for more information, and download the app at Travel Ninja.
Climbing Arthur’s Seat was one of the most exhilarating experiences of my time in Edinburgh. Imagine a clear, crisp morning with the sun rising over the Firth of Forth, casting an ethereal glow on the city. The ascent started near Holyrood Palace, weaving through the ruins of St. Anthony’s Chapel, a reminder of Edinburgh’s rich medieval history. Hikers of all sorts pepper the path — from eager tourists snapping pictures with their smartphones to local fitness enthusiasts jogging up the steep inclines. Everyone seemed to share a silent camaraderie, exchanging nods and smiles along the trail. The mixed accents and languages created a lovely, international symphony that added to the vibrant atmosphere.
When I finally neared the summit, a light breeze carried the distant sound of bagpipes from the city below, blending tradition with the modern panoramic view of Edinburgh. The city sprawled out in a magnificent tapestry of ancient and contemporary architecture, from the historic Edinburgh Castle to the sleek modern buildings of the financial district. The hike itself costs nothing, and I packed a small picnic, making it an incredibly budget-friendly adventure. Along the way, I met a fellow traveler from Australia, and we shared stories and laughs, reveling in the sheer beauty of the moment. Descending during the quieter off-hours, as the sun set, I felt a deeper connection to Edinburgh’s capacity to harmonize its storied past with the vibrant pulse of its present. It’s a place where every stone has a story, and every visitor adds a chapter.
Visiting Edinburgh Castle was an unforgettable blend of history and vibrant energy. As I walked up the cobbled streets, I felt a surge of anticipation mix with the chatter of diverse visitors — families, solo travelers, and history buffs all eager to explore. The entrance fee was around £18, but the ticket was more than worth it for the immersive experience. From the moment I stepped inside, the dramatic skyline views of the city below took my breath away. I was particularly captivated by the eerie silence of the Crown Jewels room, juxtaposed with the lively banter in the Great Hall. Each stone seemed to whisper tales of battles fought and royal ceremonies celebrated.
One moment, I found myself deep in conversation with a friendly staff member who shared a fascinating story about the castle’s role in the Wars of Independence. This interaction highlighted how the castle isn’t just a relic of the past but a vibrant part of Edinburgh’s living history. Wandering through the serene off-hours, with fewer crowds, allowed me to truly absorb the subtle sounds — the fluttering of flags, distant bagpipes, and the soft murmur of wind through ancient stone archways. This visit significantly deepened my appreciation for Edinburgh’s unique blend of tradition and modernity, illustrating how the city harmoniously balances its rich heritage with dynamic present-day life.
Stepping onto the Royal Mile was like diving headfirst into a live tapestry of history and modern-day vibrance. The cobblestone streets echoed with centuries of stories, while vibrant street performers and pipers filled the air with music. I was immediately struck by the mix of tourists, locals, and performers — an eclectic blend that embodies the heart of Edinburgh. Strolling past historic landmarks like St Giles’ Cathedral and the imposing Edinburgh Castle, every corner seemed to unveil another layer of the city’s rich tapestry. Even during the quieter off-hours, the aura of the Royal Mile was palpable, as though the stones themselves whispered secrets of the past.
One of the highlights was chatting with a local shop owner who shared tales of how the street has transformed over decades, blending tradition with a contemporary touch. Simple pleasures, like a delicious Scottish breakfast at a café for around £10, included nurturing interactions that highlighted the warmth and friendliness of the Scots. Observing the city’s signature mix of old and new — from ancient buildings to modern boutiques — it became clear how deeply rooted Edinburgh’s culture is in juxtaposition. The experience was enlightening, deepening my appreciation for how Edinburgh maintains its heritage while embracing the future. It’s a must-visit for anyone eager to feel the pulse of this historical yet vibrant city.
Visiting the Edinburgh International Festival was nothing short of magical. The moment I walked down the cobbled streets towards the stunning venues, the air buzzed with a palpable energy. Imagine a throng of people from all corners of the world, mingling and sharing excited whispers about the performances they were about to witness. I was surrounded by a delightful mix of locals in their traditional kilts, international travelers, and fervent art enthusiasts. The iconic Edinburgh Castle loomed majestically in the background, embodying the city’s rich history, while the innovative art installations and modern performances celebrated its vibrant, contemporary spirit.
The sounds of traditional Scottish bagpipes intertwined with modern electronic beats, creating a soundtrack that’s uniquely Edinburgh. During an off-hour stroll, I soaked in quieter moments — artists rehearsing, street performers practicing, and quaint cafés bustling with animated conversations. My tickets totaled about £50, which wasn’t too steep considering the world-class talent on display. One memorable interaction was with a local vendor selling handmade crafts; our chat about the city’s fusion of heritage and innovation truly deepened my appreciation for Edinburgh’s culture. It was a thrilling reminder of how much this city treasures its past while passionately embracing the future.
The Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo is an experience that transcends mere performance; it feels like you’re stepping into a grand historical tapestry illuminated by the stunning Edinburgh Castle backdrop. The atmosphere is electric as thousands of spectators gather, their chatter weaving a symphony of international dialects. Bagpipes wail, drums thunder, and the synchronized marching of soldiers from myriad nations is simply spellbinding. The mix of traditional Highland dancers and modern pyrotechnics perfectly encapsulates Edinburgh’s blend of the old and the new. I found myself exchanging stories with a cheerful Canadian couple and a history teacher from France, each of whom added richness to the night’s collective awe. This blend of global camaraderie was a delightful reminder of how shared experiences can bridge cultures.
Cost-wise, tickets can range from £25 to £300 depending on your seating preferences, and it’s worth splurging a bit for a good view. Off-hours, the venue is quieter but retains an almost sacred aura, allowing one to ponder the legacies etched within its ancient stone walls. An endearing interaction with one of the ushers, who shared tales of past Tattoos and his pride in the event, deepened my appreciation for the cultural tapestry of Scotland. This visit was more than just a spectacle; it was a lens into Edinburgh’s soul, a city where the echoes of history harmonize with the pulse of modern life. If you’re planning a trip, make this a non-negotiable stop; it’s worth every penny and moment.
Strolling through the gateway of the Palace of Holyroodhouse felt like stepping into a living tapestry of history and elegance. The grandeur of the Baroque architecture left me awestruck as I walked along the cobblestoned courtyard. The atmosphere buzzed with a mix of curious tourists, diligent historians, and locals proud of their heritage. Each room seemed to whisper stories of royals and revolutions, with curated displays of regal artifacts that took us back in time. The cool Scottish breeze, juxtaposed with the warmth of the sun filtering through ancient windows, added a tangible vitality to the experience. I paced myself to soak in the details, which I was pleasantly surprised cost only £18 for adults and £16 for concessions — undoubtedly great value for an afternoon immersed in history.
During quieter off-hours, the palace exuded a tranquil, almost meditative ambiance. I exchanged thoughts with a friendly visitor from Wales, who shared her fascination with the well-preserved state apartments and the ruins of Holyrood Abbey. A chatty guide brought Mary, Queen of Scots’ chambers to life, highlighting tales that bridged the gap between the past and the present. This visit wasn’t just about crossing a landmark off my list; it deepened my appreciation for Edinburgh’s unique blend of tradition and modernity. The Palace of Holyroodhouse is a living reminder of Edinburgh’s storied resilience and vibrancy, seamlessly blending its historical significance with its modern-day cultural pulse.
A visit to an Edinburgh whisky tasting tour is nothing short of magical. As I stepped into the dimly lit room with its rich oak barrels and polished copper stills, the warm scent of aged whisky filled the air. The venue was an eclectic mix of history and modernity; old wooden beams contrasted with sleek glass tasting stations. The hum of excited chatter from visitors, both locals, and international tourists, set a vibrant atmosphere. During off-hours, the pace slowed down, and there was a serene, almost meditative quality to the experience, allowing for deeper reflection and quiet exploration of the detailed process of whisky making.
The mix of people was fascinating — an older gentleman passionately discussed whisky nuances with a curious young couple from Australia, while a group of friends from London laughed and snapped photos. I engaged in a lively conversation with one of the knowledgeable staff members who explained the region’s rich traditions and how they’ve evolved into today’s contemporary culture. All this for an affordable £25, covering the tour and multiple tastings. This blend of past and present, seen through the lens of a single glass of whisky, enriched my understanding of Edinburgh’s culture and social life, emphasizing its ability to honor tradition while embracing modernity.
Wandering through Princes Street Gardens was a fantastical experience that highlighted Edinburgh’s intricate dance between tradition and modernity. The lush greenery, framed by the grand Edinburgh Castle on one side and the bustling Princes Street on the other, creates a vivid juxtaposition. During my visit, I was enveloped by the melodic chimes of the Scotsman Steps blending with the bustling energy of street performers and locals enjoying a quiet afternoon. Families with children, tourists with their maps, and joggers in their element painted a diverse picture that felt distinctly Edinburgh. The gardens were a living museum of serene natural beauty and historical monuments, from the Ross Fountain to the Scott Monument.
During the quieter morning hours, I relished the tranquility, sipping coffee from a nearby café (about £3) while perched on a bench with a view. An elderly local gentleman struck up a conversation, sharing tales of the city’s history and his childhood memories of the Gardens, making the experience even richer. There was no entrance fee, making the journey light on the wallet but heavy on cultural enrichment. This outing offered a window into the city’s soul, reflecting how Edinburgh cherishes its heritage while embracing the present. It deepened my appreciation for the city’s harmonious blend of the old and new.
Walking into the Scottish National Gallery is like stepping into a vivid tapestry of art and history nestled in the heart of Edinburgh. The atmosphere is a thrilling blend of hushed reverence and palpable excitement, with an eclectic mix of visitors ranging from curious tourists to passionate art students sketching in corners. The grandeur of the neoclassical architecture, crowned with light streaming through expansive windows, accentuates the aura of timeless elegance. Whether it’s a weekday or a less crowded hour, the gallery offers a serene sanctuary where one can immerse themselves fully without the bustling crowd, whispering to each other in awe of the masterpieces around them. Entry is wonderfully free, although donations are welcomed, making it an accessible cultural experience.
As I ambled through the halls, I found myself in engaging conversations with both the friendly staff and fellow art enthusiasts, each interaction layering my understanding of Edinburgh’s rich cultural fabric. One elderly local, a retired professor, shared fascinating anecdotes about some lesser-known works, giving me a deeper appreciation of the gallery’s diverse collection. This blend of tradition and modernity is palpable; historic pieces sit comfortably alongside contemporary works, reflecting Edinburgh’s unique cultural dynamism. The gallery not only houses Scotland’s national treasures but also serves as a reflection of its evolving identity, making it a truly enriching experience both for the seasoned art lover and the casual visitor alike.
Wandering through Dean Village felt like stepping into a hidden gem nestled within modern Edinburgh. Walking along the cobbled streets, the gentle hum of the Water of Leith accompanied my every step. The historic architecture, with its quaint cottages and ivy-clad buildings, created a picture-perfect scene that seemed straight out of a fairy tale. Despite its tranquil atmosphere, there was an undercurrent of energy, a blend of locals and tourists appreciating the serenity. I stumbled upon a charming cafe where a cup of coffee and a slice of cake cost me around £7. Sipping my warm drink, I marveled at the village’s peacefulness, in stark contrast to the bustling city center just a short walk away.
During my visit, I chatted with a couple from Germany who shared their love for Edinburgh’s seamless blend of old and new. Their enthusiasm mirrored my own. This interaction highlighted how Dean Village captures Edinburgh’s unique spirit, balancing tradition with modern living. Exploring off-hours, I found a rare quiet, broken only by birdsong and the occasional passerby. This reflective silence allowed me to appreciate the village’s history and charm deeply. This visit gave me a deeper connection to Edinburgh’s culture, showing a side of the city that values historical preservation while simultaneously embracing contemporary life. If you ever find yourself in Edinburgh, take a moment to breathe in Dean Village’s beauty — it’s a budget-friendly escape into another era.

In March of 2023, I visited Edinburgh (for the second time) for my birthday. It was an amazing holiday, crammed full of sightseeing and activities. There was one thing in particular, however, that I noticed on this trip to the Scottish capital, and that was the number of sculptures I came across, particularly the amount of animal-related statues.
As a fan of critters and public art, I set out to document as many as I could find and have put this article together so you too can follow the trail of Edinburgh’s animals, whilst stopping off at some of my recommendations for a visit to the city.
Starting at the central Edinburgh Waverley station, head down to High Street, part of the famous Royal Mile of Edinburgh's Old Town. Heading towards Edinburgh Castle in the west, you’ll come across St Giles’ Cathedral, its grandeur impossible to miss. Look into the sky in front of the cathedral and you’ll notice Scotland’s magnificent national animal, the unicorn — though a very tiny one.
This structure is called the Mercat Cross and is a 19th-century replacement of the 15th-century original. This octagonal…

Admittedly, at first glance, a publication with a name like Where Cars Don’t Go might not seem like the place to write about a trip to Scotland’s national capital. Still, Edinburgh, a strikingly historic city, turned out to be one of the most walkable places I’ve ever explored.
Sure, there are buses, taxis, and the occasional tram — but Edinburgh also boasts an incredibly compact city centre, pedestrianized streets, and stunning walking paths through its urban core and surrounding hills.
So in Edinburgh, just do as the old Sesame Street song suggested:
How do you get from here to there? What do you do? Well, if you’re visiting your neighbour, here’s my advice to you. Simply walk across the street and look both ways with care; that is how you get from here to there! You use your feet!
So yes, we used our feet! In fact, we did not take a single taxi or bus the entire time we were there! Well… Let me amend that. We did take a “tour” on the Hop on Hop off bus and the Ghost Bus, but those are stories for…

I arrived in the Harry Potter city of Edinburgh — and don’t be fooled by the name. You don’t pronounce it EdinBURGH you pronounce it EdinBRUGH. The Scots, with their quick tongues, will correct you as swiftly as they can down a pint. You will either be marked as one of many tourists, who have been drawn by the promises of fairytale castles, the beautiful Lochs, and the towering Bens. Even worse, you might be labelled as a Brit if you speak with just a hint of a British accent.
I visited Scotland in the Autumn. I’ve been told that was the right time to visit Scotland. The fantastical vibe of Edinburgh was only enhanced during this time. With a light sizzling, the cobblestones were covered in water, and the grey clouds hung above the city, adding to the dramatic effect of the city.
Edinburgh is one of those cities, that has adventures hiding almost everywhere. Every alleyway will lead you into a labyrinth of mystery, where you get the feeling that just around the next corner, you will find yourself in the middle of a scene from Harry Potter, an English detective story, or on the way to cross into fairy tale country.
The first thing you notice in Edinburgh is the castle. On a hill in the middle of the city, you see the castle. It served as the guiding point for me, allowing me to orientate myself, simply by fixing my gaze upon this old castle.
The second thing you notice is the people. Even in autumn, Edinburgh is crowded with tourists. People walk The Royal Mile, Victoria Street, filling up the many pubs and cafés. People are coming to this place, for the same reason I did. We’ve seen pictures of Scotland, we’ve heard the stories, we’ve been allured by the sights and finally convinced ourselves to buy that ticket.
While I was in Edinburgh, I had the chance to visit the closest thing to a mountain that Edinburgh boasts of. Arthur’s seat — An ancient, extinct volcano that takes up the east of Edinburgh. The hills are shrouded in mythology, some say it was the location of Camelot, hence the name. There is more tangible evidence of it serving as old Iron Age hill forts.
To get up there, you are faced with a light hike, but the views offered from the top will make up for it. At the top of Arthur’s Seat, you will be offered the most panoramic and scenic view of Edinburgh that you can ask for.
When you are at the top of the hill, on your east you have the sea, on the west, you have the city, the north is sheer mountains. Right in the middle you have Edinburgh.
Edinburgh was just the first of my stops during my time in Scotland. I went there alone and had planned absolutely nothing. I had zero plans, zero expectations, and zero connections — I would just let it play out however it would play out.
After leaving Edinburgh, my next stop was just a short train ride away — Glasgow. The capital of Scotland. This was where I got my first taste of the Scotland I wanted to see, as I boarded a packed day tour to the western Scottish highlands.
On this tour, organized by the friendly staff at Rabbies we went through much of the western Highlands. We got the chance to hear the tales of old clan rivalries, saw castles that had been standing for hundreds of years, visited the beautiful area of Glencoe, and finally, visited the port city known for its whisky — Oban. I already wrote a story about Oban and one of the wonderful people I met there.
Despite having travelled for many years, this was my first experience with a planned day tour. To no fault of the lovely driver at Rabbies, I discovered this wasn’t how I like to explore. It was a lovely tour, and we got to see many of the breathtaking landscapes that Scotland offers, but I like travelling at my own pace.
Getting in and out of a bus, and getting to know the local history, without having time to explore the area is not how I like to travel. When I see the vast untamed beauty of nature, I want to explore it at my own pace. The hills and mountains that just go on seemingly forever. Imagine rolling hills that look like they’ve been plucked from a painting, and then you have to leave to go on to the next scenic destination. Seeing so many beautiful places almost seemed overwhelming, and it was as if I got a sense of diminishing returns as we went from one breathtaking location to another.
That being said, it is hard to describe the beauty of the landscape. The rolling hills of Glencoe, the place where 30 of the McDonald’s were slaughtered in 1862, to the iconic road features in Skyfall.
As drive through Glencoe, you will be faced with three mountains. In Gaelic the mountains are called Aonach Dubh, Beinn Fhada, and Gearr Aonach. These are the mountains that are together known as the Three Sisters of Glencoe, also known as Bidean Nam Bian. All three of the sisters are recognized by their dramatic peaks, with their tops playing hide and seek with the clouds.
After a day spent in the highlands, we headed back towards Glasgow. The tour back, offered as many scenic views as the way up to the towering mountains. As we stopped at a nondescript city on the coast, we got a final view of the rolling hills and mountains, as the sun was setting.
It seemed like the perfect end to the tour, and it had only increased my hunger to tour more of the highlands.
After having spent a few days in Glasgow, meeting with other travellers, where I went to my first rugby match, I decided to leave Glasgow and venture into the highlands. I didn’t know where I was headed, so I just booked a train that headed north and picked a city at random, that city turned out to be Fort William.
As I was venturing north, equally occupied by writing and obsessing over the scenery. A fellow traveller, a Scotswoman, laughed at me for trying to capture all the scenic sights we saw. My camera was as if glued to the window when I wasn’t writing. Then while obsessing over trying to write and capture all this wonderful landscape, I heard the name Fort William as we were stopping. In a rush, I packed all my things and ran out of the train.Running out, I heard the Scotswoman say something, but it was lost to the panic of me losing my stop.
As I got out of the station of Fort William, I looked around and saw…Nothing.
I panicked and ran out of the train at the wrong station.
So now, I was standing in the middle of nowhere, but why not get the best out of it? So after asking at the nearby town, when a bus or train was going anywhere. To my surprise, I was told that in a couple of hours, a bus towards Fort William would go through the city.
I was just at the precipice of the highlands, where forest meets mountains — and I decided to get the best out of it. So I left my stuff at a nearby inn and started hiking.
As I wandered through the forest, the air became crisp. I was immersed in the sound of the forest, that seemed to know no man. The scent of pine, the sound of animals moving through the forest, and a sense of calm descended upon me.
Within what seemed like the blink of an eye, a few hours had passed, and I had to hurry back to the city, to not be left, yet another time in this beautiful area.
When we finally arrived at Fort William, it was dark, windy, and rainy. I looked around at night and thought to myself that it was good I had just booked a night here. There was nothing in sight, TripAdvisor gave a few hints of things to do in Fort William, but all was out of season. When I googled things to do here, all that came up was day tours. I had ventured deep into the Scottish Highlands, to a city that had nothing to do.
How wrong I was.
As I finally arrived at my hostel, I was wet, on the verge of falling asleep, and hungry. I was met by what looked like a big family’s house. It was Fort William Backpackers, and within it, I would find my home for the remainder of my time in Scotland.
It is said that the people make the experiences, and I can only agree with this after my experiences at Fort William. There were about 15 people at the hostel, and it all seemed like one big family. We did daily activities, hosted a movie night, went karaoke singing, and celebrated Guy Fawkes night together.
Despite all the adventures I had already been on in Scotland, there was one thing I didn’t know that I needed. Fort William was known for one thing: Ben Nevis. The highest mountain in the UK — One of the reasons why so many people make a pilgrimage to Fort William in the first place. Something I was wholly unaware of.
Let’s call it fate, would have it that I was in the city located at the base of the highest mountain in the UK, and I knew I had to hike it.
The hike up the mountain was fairly easy. At least, until halfway up the mountain, where the trail disappears, and you are left at times climbing. It seemed like everywhere I went, I saw beautiful scenery. Everywhere was Ben’s (Gaelic for mountain), stretching as far as the eye can see.
As I hiked up the mountain, the weather got worse and worse. Caught in the middle of first a rainstorm, and then as I climbed higher, a beginning blizzard.
As I finally found myself at the top of the mountain, the blizzard kicked in. I was caught in the middle of a white-out and simply had to wait it out. At the top of the mountain, you find a small observatory that is now more of a ruin than anything else. It was at the pillars of this old observatory that I found shelter while waiting out the blizzard.
Half an hour later, the weather improved to a degree that I dared move down again.
Having conquered the highest mountain in the UK on my last day in Scotland was something of a symbolic victory. Despite having conquered the mountain, I can only say that I am by no means done in Scotland — 10 days had gone by in the blink of an eye, and suddenly, my journey had come to an end.
There are more stories to tell about Scotland, but for now, let me leave you with some scenic pictures of my journey.
Thank you very much for reading, if you like this, I have a full travel list here!

Edinburgh is by far the most visited city in Scotland, indeed one of the most visited cities in the UK, yet most visitors rarely venture beyond the Old Town. Although that part of the city is beautiful and historic, only seeing that small segment means missing out on a unique variety that only Edinburgh can offer. There are any number of places to go, all with their own character and virtues, but I’m going to suggest just three. Both to keep it simple and to encourage a little more adventure for those with the time and inclination.
Sitting in a steep valley that runs straight through the northern reaches of the city centre New Town, the Water of Leith runs eastwards towards Leith Shore and the Firth of Forth. Nestled on the banks of this shallow but rapid river is the ancient site of Dean Village. Some of the housing down here dates back to the 16th and 17thcenturies with Tudor style wood beam construction and some early Scottish Baronial mixed with French influence. The area was once the home of a thriving wool industry, with water powered mills dating as far back as the 16th century. Today it is a regularly photographed little gem that’s extremely easy to miss.
The easiest way to find this fascinating little spot is to head for Stockbridge, at the heart of New Town. There you can join the walk beside the Water of Leith and head west beside the river. This has the added bargain of taking you past the delightful St Bernard’s Well. You’ll quickly find yourself in an oasis of nature, during the summer it’s filled with bird song. Keep an eye out for herons and wagtails. It can be breath-taking to realise that you’re still in the middle of the city on this walk, as it feels like you couldn’t be further from it. Eventually you’ll come to the vibrant yellow Tudor style buildings and the staggering red brick Scottish Baronial Well Court that distinguish the heart of Dean Village. Stop to take it in, grab a photo or two from the footbridge, but don’t forget that just across the river is the old Dean School buildings that now house the Scottish National Galleries of Modern Art.
If quiet little spots of ancient history are your thing and, if you’re visiting Edinburgh, I assume they are, you shouldn’t miss Crammond. This is a little more off the beaten track than Dean Village, requiring a bus ride at the least. To be honest, if it wasn’t for Crammond, there’d be almost no reason to head out in this direction. Yet this small village area, that’s been swallowed by the city over time, really does make the journey worthwhile. If you’re interested in the second world war this is also worth the trip. The same can even be said if ancient Roman ruins are your thing.
From the city centre you’ll want to head to Drumshaugh Pl to the west end of Princes Street. There you can get the 47 bus to Crammond Pl. The trip shouldn’t take any more than about 35 mins but will take you through endless bungalows into what appears to be the depths of suburbia. The bus terminates at this Crammond Pl so there’s not too much worry about missing your stop. From the bus you might want to check Google maps or something to make sure you’re going the right way. Having said that it’s a simple and brief walk down to the old village that is instantly recognisable for it’s pretty, secluded and historic construction. The kirk (church) that sits in the heart of the old community dates back to the Middle Ages and many of the old buildings are early modern at the latest. You might want to go on the hunt for the ruins of the Roman fort or, if the tides are right, take the wartime causeway out to Crammond Island. In the Village you can find a good pub lunch or a tasty wee café, then maybe take the waterfront walk along Silverknows.
For bird lovers keep an eye out for the multitude of waders on the mudflats here, where the River Almond runs out into the Firth of Forth. There are reasonable views of the bridges to be had here, although not as good as from South Queensferry. Along the waterfront walk it turns from mud flats to semi-sandy beach. Generally, you’ll find a lot of locals with their families or walking their dogs around this area. It’s definitely a weekend favourite for many Edinburgh natives.
Not just a great place to visit, this is a part of the city it’s well worth considering staying in. There are a few hotels and BnB’s in the area, although it’s very much a residential spot. This won’t be for everyone, but if you’re looking for a little taste of living like the locals, this might be the place for you.
Bruntsfield sits beside the Bruntsfield Links, a green space that run into one of the city parks known as The Meadows. The area is rich with cafés, grocers, even one of my favourite book shops. There are exceptional bus links to just about everywhere you might want to go and it’s an easy, pleasant walk through the park to get to the Old Town and museums. There’s a significant student, graduate and academic population in the area due to proximity to the University of Edinburgh and Napier University. The broad, cobbled, and tree lined streets of neighbouring Marchmont make for a delightful residential area with a few eateries and handy shops if you’re going self-catering.
There are entertainments down the main road in Tollcross or walking through Bruntsfield and Polwarth to Fountain Park. The architecture in the area is probably some of the best in Edinburgh for residences, with the grand tenements with broad bay windows on full display. There’re also some quirks like the Wild West street just a few minutes’ walk into Morningside or Colinton Tunnel, a brief bus ride away.
So, whether you want a quiet moment, a taste of many eras of history in one place, or the chance to live like the locals, these three suggestions should be a little guidance. Don’t forget that there’s much more than these few places I’ve mentioned. If you want to know more then keep following my writing as I provide further information and insight into this beautiful city I love.

Discover Edinburgh the jewel of Scotland
Edinburgh is Scotland’s compact, hilly capital. It has a medieval Old Town and elegant Georgian New Town with gardens and neoclassical buildings. Looming over the city is Edinburgh Castle, home to Scotland’s crown jewels and the Stone of Destiny, used in the coronation of Scottish rulers. Arthur’s Seat is an imposing peak in Holyrood Park with sweeping views, and Calton Hill is topped with monuments and memorials.
Edinburgh is also famous for castles and palaces.
If you want to go back in time to this era, you must visit Edinburgh.
The people of Edinburgh are so friendly, and they are opening up to different cultures.

I arrived in Edinburgh on a sunny afternoon at the beginning of March from the train station, having come in by cross-country Scotrail from Glasgow. I didn’t know what to expect, but in my heart, I knew that the main vein of Scotland would be pure magic. Motivating. From the first glimpse of the stony edifices of Haymarket, to the towering spires of the cathedrals and Scott Monument, I was sold. I exited Edinburgh Waverley with a pounding heart — both from the heavy hiking backpack I sported and the cool air that surrounded me. There were thousands of voices, honking car horns, blaring sirens, laughter, and in the distance, I could even make out the screech of bag pipes.
My first accommodation, the Cowgate Hostel, located near the famous Cowgate arches and the Grassmarket, was tucked on a lower road that I had no idea how to get to; and I soon found myself wondering the maze-like hills of the Old Town, gazing up with wistful eyes to the chimney stacks on the rooftops and marvelous stonework. I could see already how masterminds of the creative world, like J.K. Rowling, found their inspiration in this place.
Having put my belongings in storage at the hostel for now, I headed back out through Fleshmarket Close to reach the main road where Edinburgh Castle and several other attractions could be found. Though I didn’t go into the castle, as it was extremely crowded, I did indulge in the views from the parking lot to the right and left of me, the sound of Braveheart and Highlander impersonators, and the overflow of Tartan. I ended up jumping souvenir shop to shop, just looking at the woolen scarves and kilt packages that were available. In one of the shops, I happened to find a display of surname books.
Now, my mother has for many years told me about her Scottish grandparents, the Lapps. A few years ago, after discussing the surname with a friend of mine whose Scottish lineage is clear (there’s even a fiefdom with their name still in existence), and learning that Lapp is Jewish, German, French, and even a designation of people from Lapland, I decided to search for Lapp on this wall of heritage books. Not one Lapp. But I did find Taylor, an ancient Scottish clan from the 13th century.
I was delighted, especially since the clan had been weaponsmiths, and one, the Black Taylor, wielded a battle ax. It kind of reminded me of my father. When I mentioned it, he was kind of excited by the possibility of being from a place where one of his favorite movies (he’s a Highlander fan) had been set.Thus, I found myself even more engaged with Scotland, seeing how my predecessors could have indeed hailed from Scotland…even if it wasn’t the side of the family that I had imagined.
Throughout the two weeks I spent in Edinburgh, I invested most of my evenings to dancing at the National Dance Centre for Scotland, Dance Base. The studio is located on the upper floors of buildings that make up the Grassmarket area but is state-of-the-art and one of the best studios I have ever been to. I’ll be discussing more about Dance Base later on in the article. When I wasn’t dancing, I was walking all around Old Town and New Town, enjoying the assortment of cafes and free attractions that are available.
Though the weather wasn’t always agreeable, since it rained half the time, I could still find things to do.
Although I spent a little over 2 weeks in Edinburgh for the purpose of dancing and working on a novel, anyone who is going to Scotland to see the sights and learn the history could easily get the majority of must see attractions and must do activities finished within a week or less.
I talked with another American named Grace who had lived in London for a few years and was heading back to the States once she left Edinburgh about how small the city is. We were both surprised, especially since she’d come from places like California and London and me from the sprawling metropolis of Tokyo, Japan and New York City. Edinburgh is compact, but that doesn’t mean it is lacking in things to do. You just need to pace yourself if you have more than 3 days in Edinburgh.
The places I went while in Edinburgh:
Other recommendations (that I didn’t visit personally):
I recommend going to Holyrood Park on a nice day, because when the wind blows, it can be brutally cold, even when the sun is shining. You should also wear the proper shoes, since the mud can be slippery. I had come right from a dance class and was wearing my worn out trainers, causing me to take a few heart-stopping slides while working my way up and down the slope. It’s definitely something you should do, though, because you feel like you are in Scottish Highlands, what with the sweeping views of Leith and Portobello Beach, snow-capped hills in the winter, and the horizon. I took paths less traveled around the knolls, finding my way to quiet lakes and dancing blades of grass. It seemed like I had been transported to the fantasy lands of my mind for just a moment. Then I turned around to head back towards the Parliament House.
I did the crags one day then tackled the Queen’s Drive path another day. The Queen’s Drive brings you around the backside of Arthur’s Seat. If you hard enough, you can see Cragmillar Castle in the distance from one point.Another day I took a walk towards Dean Village then continued up to the Inverleith Park and Royal Botanical Gardens. Dean Village was quaint and small, and there’s not much more to see there than the preserved buildings in a picturesque layout. The Water of Leith walk was closed off, but I did get to walk a little of it before climbing a narrow flight of steps to a sloping road that eventually brought me to the Inverleith Park. There was a small pond there where ducks were swimming. From the top of the hill, you get a marvelous view of Old Town in the distance with the sun in the backdrop that’s definitely worth seeing as the sun begins to dip low.
Since the Scottish air was still cold and damp, not much was growing in the Royal Botanical Gardens, but the exhibits in the buildings were interesting, and the shop had some sustainable items that are worth a look-see. The gardens were a nice place to sit down to read a book or have a snack or two, so keep that in mind if you plan on going when the weather is a bit warmer.The other place for fantastic views would be Calton Hill. Though I could have chosen a less gray and dreary day to visit the monuments and observation center, I was also glad that it was less crowded than usual. This allowed me to take my time going from point-to-point and seeing all that Calton Hill and the world beyond had to offer.
One of my favorite spots, though, was Greyfriar’s Kirk, nestled among the brick buildings beyond the Greenmarket. I wondered the cemetery for at least 30 minutes, snapping pictures of the elaborate and intricate headstones and murals, as well as the fresh sakura blossoms on the trees. With the spire of a cathedral rising above the annexed rows of buildings, the gravestones, and the trees to capture my gaze, I felt like I was seeing a whole new world, and in my mind the Harry Potter theme started to play. Go figure that the Elephant House, where J.K. Rowling is said to have written much of the Harry Potter series is not even a two minute walk from Greyfriar’s Kirk.
Indeed, there is something scintillating about Edinburgh that is hard to put to words. You see a world beyond the one that exists now, especially as you begin to delve deeper into the history and the culture. You can almost feel the ancient energies still at work in Auld Reekie, even with the graffiti, weathered billboards, and boisterous voices throughout the night at beer gardens.
I found myself taken with Edinburgh and promising that one day I would be back. This was one part the location and energy. The other was thanks to the wonderful experiences I had at Dance Base.
One of the things that I indulged in while visiting Edinburgh was jumping from cafe to cafe throughout the day to do work and drink coffee. Seeing how I am always concerned about my budget, I rarely eat or drink out when I travel, but seeing how the cafe culture in Edinburgh is thriving and I needed a place to work, cafes were the wisest option.
My first choice was Black Medicine Coffee Co., located on South Bridge Road, a short walk from my accommodations. Black Medicine Coffee Co. has some awesome history, so check out the website to learn more about how long they have been in business and more about the building where the cafe is located. But you’re more interested in the coffee and food, I’m sure. On different days, I enjoyed the cappuccino, a long black, and a flat white. Every caffeinated concoction was as good as the last, with a smooth finish and gracious sized cups for the price. They also have vegetarian/vegan food options, as well as a broad selection of soups, sandwiches, breads, and sweeter treats to satisfy you. The free wifi at Black Medicine was speedy. I could even log into my MMORPG without any issues and experienced zero lag.
Next, I went to Coffee Angel, a little further down on the same road. Coffee Angel serves up some of the best paninis I’ve had in a long time. They come fresh out of the sandwich press with a free side of tortilla chips. The almond croissants are delicious as well. If you order a pot of tea, you honestly get a whole pot of freshly brewed tea that fills about 2.5 tea cups, if you are drinking it on your own. There are a number of electrical outlets in the cafe, too. I did have some wifi connection problems on my computer, but my phone connected flawlessly.
Lastly, I went to Frederick’s Coffee and Wine, another highly-rated cafe for coworking and cakes. Though I didn’t find any coworking space, as it was rather crowded, the chairs were comfortable. You also get service right at your seat, and the hall staff brings everything right to you. I got myself a pot of Japanese Cherry tea. The delicate green tea and sakura flavor blended well with the Raspberry-Pecan slice and scoop of vanilla ice cream that I ordered. Frederick’s also has more substantial meals, a broad selection of crafted coffees and teas, and all-day breakfast on Sunday. If you want to connect to the free wifi, ask the server for the password. They don’t mind how long you stay, either.
Doing as I usually do when traveling, I stayed at multiple accommodations in Edinburgh: the Cowgate Hostel, Safestay Edinburgh, and the High Street Hostel. This worked out in my favor when the weather was dismal for a few days. Each location was within walking distance from the next, so I never really left Cowgate Road or Old Town.
For the budget backpacker, I recommended either the Cowgate Hostel or High Street Hostel for your stay. Cowgate Hostel is cheaper that HSH and Safestay for good reason — it’s a bit rough around the edges and right across from a beer garden that lasts until 03:00 in the morning. There’s little to keep the noise from echoing throughout the building, and the beds aren’t that comfortable; but overall, the bathrooms are spacious, and the kitchen was nice. I didn’t have any problems here, save for the one night a group of French guys came back from drinking and could be heard vomiting in the bathroom right next to my bunk bead. Like I said, no sound barriers.
High Street Hostel was nice in terms of noise level. The rooms were quiet 9 out of 10 times, and the way the beds are built means you don’t get any shaking. Plus, the mattresses were supportive but also soft enough. I slept well every single night, which says a lot. You also get two pillows. The kitchen/lounge area was really nice, too. However, the problem I had with High Street Hostel was the staff. The kitchen was supposed to open at 6:30 AM, but every morning, the person who was opening it was late and gave me an attitude when I asked. Oh, and if you like drinking, be sure to be there for “Thorsday,” for the pub crawl.
If you have a slightly higher budget, stay at Safestay on the Royal Mile. There are single, double, and dormitory style rooms available, a guest kitchen, discounts on food and drink, plenty of space to find a lounging spot, and even storage for your belongings. The free wifi is speedy (so don’t both upgrading to the high speed). I had no problems connecting. There was a lack of charging points in the dormitory room, and people tended to get possessive of their outlets, which led to some awkward exchanges when you wanted to charge your phone or computer. But the en suite toilets and showers were great. You spend a little more, but you’ll be pretty comfortable here.
Overall, I would rate Safestay the highest, HSH at the middle, and Cowgate the lowest in terms of comfort.
Other hotels and hostels that I recommend:
There’s also a number of guest houses and bed-and-breakfasts near the Edinburgh Zoo that I saw when traveling on the Airlink bus to the airport.
So what is this Dance Base I keep praising so highly? Dance Base is Scotland’s National Centre for Dance, a collection of professionals and recreational dancers that is warm, welcoming, and wholesome. The studio is open to everyone, whether you have disabilities or are looking for a safe place as a member of the LGBT+ community. There are accessible facilities, like genderless bathrooms and changing rooms (along with traditional designated ones), elevators for those with wheelchairs, and dance classes open to those with handicaps and disabilities as well.The professional classes are done early in the morning as well in the evening, and you get free access to shows. Professionals can ever hire studios for rehearsal or shows.For general classes, there are several levels, ranging from absolute beginner to intermediate-advanced. I took a range of classes, finding that each one had something challenging about it. My drop-in schedule was full, and that is only a small piece of all the classes that are offered at Dance Base, so if you can stay for a term, do it. I took Contemporary twice a week, Improvisation, Bollywood, West African Dance, Lyrical Jazz, Ballet and Ballet Fusion, Hip Hop, and even a folk dance based workout class that was absolutely wild. Every teacher was welcoming and taught all levels flawlessly.I was pushed. I learned new methods for teaching in the future. I felt myself grow as a dancer, especially because the community here is so cheerful and open. It was amazing to sit down and just start talking about Martha Graham or other dance experiences with professionals, new and old, and the instructors. Dancers from all across the globe were here; and no one showed any negativity. You walk in feeling like you are part of a family.
So, if you are looking to further your dance training while you travel the world, I give Dance Base two thumb’s up.
My trip to Edinburgh was, in one word, awesome. I am so happy to have gone to this amazing and historical city and was able to take part in multiple dance classes with beautiful souls from all around the world. Edinburgh has a little something for everyone, though — not just dancers. If you like hiking, photography, history, art, cafe-hopping, coffee, bagpipes, the magical world of Harry Potter, flowers, murder mysteries, beer, and Scottish accents, you can find something that will delight you here, for however long you decide to stay.

A Scotsman accosted us on Edinburgh’s Lawnmarket Street, and when he found out Teresa and I were Americans, he immediately told us this joke:
“Donald Trump was visiting the Isle of Lewis — you know that’s where his mother was from? — and he came across an old man in a field digging up little potatoes. ‘In America, we grow the biggest potatoes!’ Trump boasted. ‘They grow this huge,’ he said, making a big circle with both hands.
“‘Oh, we have no need o’ that in Scotland,’ said the old man. ‘We only grow them big enough to fit in our mouths.’”
The ambush-raconteur smiled at our laughter, then told us Trump was a grave danger not only to America, but “to thee whole warld.”
Ah, Edinburgh, how we have missed ye! Teresa (my beloved spouse and co-flâneur) and I have not been here in five years. Before Covid, we spent nearly every summer holiday in the Scottish Highlands. Now suddenly, accidentally, we are back! (We had planned to spend a summer in Scandinavia — a plan we had to abruptly cancel). In…

If you’re like me (part Scottish) then a trip to Edinburgh, Scotland will be a bit more than relax and snap. I found it very important to visit the place my last name originated and was pleasantly surprised with my overall experience. I did my research and opted to bed down in Edinburgh. There, I’d have a wide range of cultural and historical amenities within walking distance or a quick cab ride. Edinburgh is a very beautiful city, and it’s lush charm is a mix of Vancouver and Prague rolled into one. With a 5-day itinerary in hand, I knew I’d have to make the most of it and pancake what I could, so I could deliver an article worthy of your time. So if you’re ever down for the Scottish experience, here are Travel Daddy’s 10 WAYS I ENJOYED SCOTLAND WHILE IN EDINBURGH…
I can honestly say without apprehension that Edinburgh has the best Taxi drivers I’ve seen or experienced on the planet. They’re prompt, courteous, knowledgeable, friendly, humble, and honorable. It’s actually quite a contrast from what I experienced in Santiago, where my safety was threatened. I would be more apt to describe them as mobile micro tour guides, possessing a high social IQ and left you with the impression that most -if not all- actually drive tourists around because they like it!
Tip them you cheap bastard — they deserve it!
2. WHISKY A DO
Oh mighty Scotch Whisky- the nectar of the Gods! Aside from Coffee and a choice Cab, nothing assaults the palette like a dram of fine aged whisky. Whether it be blended, aged or cheap, Scotland IS the mecca of Whisky. There are several options to get your fix; for me, the day tour to Loch Ness had an added bonus of visiting a legit distillery- DEANSTON.
After the tour and tasting, I couldn’t resist purchasing their premier 23 yr old. It ran me high, but every bit worth the cost since you can’t get it anywhere but there. A few days later as I exited Edinburgh Castle, I saw THE SCOTCH WHISKY EXPERIENCE, conveniently nestled on the 1st right side corner. It is home to the World’s Largest Collection of Scotch Whisky.
It Cost what!?!?!
My arrogance was quelled when upon bragging to the hosts/scotch experts that I’m on my 3rd bottle of Johnny Walker Blue ownership, they redirected my attention to truly rare and expensive whisky. I actually considered selling my house for the novelty. My son doesn’t really need to go to college right? I was even more exasperated to learn that some “poor” chap a week prior purchased a $25,000 Pound bottle and spent a total of over $40K Pounds. I’ll get there one day. There’s also a cool whisky chart which matches the flavor to the brand, for novice drinkers like myself.
Buy a bottle — Live a little!
3. LOCH NESS & HIGHLANDS DAY TRIP
I booked this day tour offered by The Hairy Coo through Trip Advisor. They offer many other tours throughout Scotland, but this one was convenient and enticing, especially with the whisky tour. The 10 hour itinerary was well thought out and included key stops like the Highland Hairy Coos, Glencoe, Whisky Distillery, Fort Augustus — home to Loch Ness, the Commando Memorial, Cairngorm Park, and Pitlochry. You can check the full itinerary here. Although Loch Ness was beautiful and worth the trip, you’ll be sorely disappointed to not catch a glimpse of it’s most famous inhabitant.
TOUR HIGHLIGHTS
What a Bridge!
On your return, you’ll cross and witness three amazing bridges adjacent to each other, one of which — The Forth Bridge- is a UNESCO site. The tour guide was friendly, knowledgeable and brimming with that Scottish wit.
Well worth the day — at least once!
4. FINE DINING
So many options- so much quality. Edinburgh is definitely a foodie destination for fine dining. You should check out my list of 10 AMAZING RESTAURANT & FOOD EXPERIENCES IN EDINBURGH. From traditional dishes like Haggis, Neeps & Tatties, to exclusive restaurants booked up months in advance, Scotland definitely has the food chops to satisfy your taste buds.
Food is most definitely a worthy Splurge- do it!
5. SO MANY PUBS… AMAZING SPEAKEASIES… GREAT NIGHTLIFE
As expected, I encountered more pubs in a 1 mile radius in Edinburgh than anywhere I’d been outside the U.K. People love to drink, and a pubs like The Advocate, The Cafe Royal Circle Bar and The Bow Bar, stood out for me as great places to knock down a few cold ones. If you fancy top-notch cocktails then there are some speakeasy type bars of high caliber like Panda & Sons and Head & Tails. For a speakeasy in the truest sense you’ll have to search the alleyways for Bullard & Worth — I won’t give you the address, but instead give you a clue. Most locals don’t even know how to find it, and it’s location on google maps was incorrect (purposely?). I had to ask several people and store owners in what felt like a treasure hunt.
Success at last…
I finally found what I had been looking for- approached, knocked, and was rewarded. The bartender was as an amazing conversationalist as he was a cocktail wizard. I’ll say no more so good luck!
As far as clubbing there are a ton of options from clubs teeming with college-aged patrons, salsa dancing, hip-hop lovers and live music. My article 10 BEST NIGHTLIFE IN EDINBURGH SCOTLAND will give you a list of good recommendations when you’re in town.
Edinburgh has great nightlife — party on!
6. CRASH A TRUE SCOTTISH WEDDING… THEN GET KICKED OUT
There I am- minding my own business at Ghillie Dhu, when I’m approached by a kilt-wearing Scotsman who wants me to buy him a pint. I oblige and as a reward he takes me upstairs to the reserved hall to see a “true Scottish wedding” as he put it. After a few drinks and introductions to the groom, I’m taking it all in being particularly wary of my visitor status. I stand to the side respectfully and silently appreciate how folks from all walks of life celebrate life’s milestones similarly but in their own unique way.
Uh-Oh….
Unfortunately, no one told the bride and ten minutes later, I’m being awkwardly escorted out of the wedding by the stoic security. No love lost though- since it was worth the experience and good blog fodder. I’m not encouraging you to intrude on someone’s big day, but try to synch with the locals in some way and get a true experience as to how folks live and celebrate.
People are different, but the same — even in Edinburgh!
7. SEE LEITH THEN WALK AIMLESSLY UNTIL PORTOBELLO
I took a cab down to Leith- a historic and artsy port Northeast of Edinburgh’s city center. It’s a must-see with top-notch restaurants, pubs and home to the Royal Yacht Britannia. The weather was great so I opted for a stroll along the canal, then made my way back inland toward the Leith Links (public parks). After catching some cricket and picnics, I headed back to the shore for some photography.
How’d I get Here?
Two hours later I’m in Portobello and realized with no cab in sight, I’d have to trek it back to the city. Using the street signs, I self-navigate past Holyrood Park and if not for my impending dinner reservations, would have walked back all the way. A kind local gives me exact change for the bus fare back to my hotel and I fulfill my dinner plans.
Great scenery & photos off the beaten path — dress for the walk!
8. STUMBLE UPON A TRADITIONAL MUSIC BAND COMPETITION
It’s a Sunday and I finally decide upon Princes Street Gardens, which is literally a stone’s throw from my hotel. With camera in hand, I knew I’d score some great shots by way of the park’s natural beauty. It’s descended location gives an almost serene respite from the bustling streets above. It isn’t long before I hear an army of bagpipes and drums. I was pleasantly surprised to spectate dozens of traditional bands practicing and performing in a competition- free to the public. I snapped away and appreciated the unique experience. The park is not open 24/7, and is worth a visit especially with kids in tow.
The Edinburgh 2019 Pipe Band Championship was amazing- the Gardens are still worth a visit!
9. BE AMAZED BY HISTORY IN OLD TOWN
There is history everywhere in the buildings, streets and closes (alleyways) of Edinburgh. If you’re a history buff or lover of things ancient, then Edinburgh is a mine of activities. Edinburgh Castle was built upon remnants of an extinct volcano, and from its elevated point you can see much of this beautiful city. A great portion of New Town with this area has been categorized as a UNESCO Heritage Site. As you descend down the cobbler streets, you’ll probably catch one of the many guided tours such as the Harry Potter Walking Tour. Much of the books and films were inspired by the streets and architecture of Old Town Edinburgh. I personally find it fascinating to walk among buildings that are older than the U.S. as a nation.
History can be awesome- don’t miss it!
10. WALK THE ROYAL MILE
The ROYAL MILE is the main street running from Edinburgh Castle all the way down to Holyrood Park. You’ll find a variety of top tourist sites like Arthur’s Seat, Edinburgh Museum, Scottish Parliament, St. Giles Cathedral, and Holyrood Palace. You can stop at several pubs and eateries along the way, easily spending a full day experiencing all it has to offer. I definitely had a blast and have the pics to prove it.
Grab your camera- This is Edinburgh!

Hi there! It’s good to see you here.
This photo is exactly where I am now — an uphill climb to see as much of the world as possible. Yet, some places capture me instantly when I arrive. Edinburgh, the city and its people, is one of those. While I write short posts with photos, this one is a longer read with even more pictures and will be in several parts.
My daughter and I decided to visit Scotland. I knew I needed a month, but because of our schedules, I only had a week. At first, our plans involved a rental car and too many stops until I realized I only wanted to see Edinburgh on this first trip. Thanks to my daughter, we enjoyed our trip, and I hope to return to a different location in Scotland at least every other year.
The city exceeded my expectations. Why? I felt immediately at home. If you’ve read my other posts, you know that a city’s vibes either make it for me or not. I have no idea why I feel the energy in things, people, and places, but I do. Edinburgh, for me, is calm and reassuring. Not so in London (as I will discuss in a later post), where we’d just left. There, I feel discombobulated. My brain hears English being spoken but doesn’t feel at home. I anticipated the same thing in Scotland, but thankfully, it didn’t happen.
We took the train from London into Edinburgh Waverley, in the city’s heart. The station is magnificent. After looking at the bus routes and getting tips from our apartment host, we decided to walk to our apartment. I’m glad we did. Here are some scenes along the way.
Our Airbnb in Marchmont near The Meadows had a lot of light, even on a somewhat gloomy day like the one above. Our flat had two bedrooms and two baths, with windows in both bedrooms, a necessity for us both. We had a pleasant morning visitor every day who watched us eat breakfast. The apartment was stocked with things to eat related to Scotland, which was a nice touch.
Our hosts at the apartment we rented in Marchmont were fabulous. They provided transportation tips and suggestions for food, even meeting with us to have a beer and a chat and answer all my questions. (I cannot get Scottish citizenship because of UK rules. They don’t like older adults, it seems.)
The Meadows is a large park near the University of Edinburgh. The paths through the garden were the easiest way to reach most of the places we decided to see daily. Edinburgh has a decent bus service, but we used our feet to take it slow and see the city center on this first trip.
We were in the city the week after Fringe, the year of a garbage workers’ strike, and our Airbnb hosts were apologetic about the city’s look. Having frequented New York City, I was surprised at how clean this city was, even amid a garbage strike. All the people, whether tourists or residents, kept the garbage in the taped-off areas with signage, and the rest of the city was kept clean.
Our landlord insisted we could not visit Edinburgh without a trip to Holyrood Park and a hike up to Arthur’s Seat. Up to the challenge (well, my daughter more than me), we set out for the hike up the hill the next day. It was worth it for the scenery alone.
If you’ve never been to Edinburgh, the main downtown area with tourist attractions is easy to wander. We began at the Palace of Holyroodhouse and walked up the Royal Mile to Edinburgh Castle, stopping in shops after lunch in a small cafe, then visiting one of the cathedrals.
Even with the level of tourists at the end of the Fringe, it was a pleasant walk without the usual hassle of packed streets and impatient tourists.
Here are more photos; I’ll have more in the next post.

I’m writing this as I realize how these memories are ones I never want to forget
In 2022, during my study exchange in the UK, I finally had the chance to explore one of my dream destinations: Edinburgh. Even though it was a short trip — just two days — visiting Edinburgh was a dream come true. I don’t know when my fascination with Edinburgh began, but I’ve always been drawn to its charm. I would often find myself lost in Pinterest searches, captivated by images of its small alleys, the rain-soaked streets, the gloomy and moody weather, and the warm tones of autumn. Without any clear reason, I’ve always felt like I belonged there.
Naturally, when my friends and I were planning our reading week itinerary — a break that happens before exam week — we decided to include Edinburgh. It was a spontaneous choice but one that made perfect sense. So, where do I begin?
We set off from Windermere (District Lake), bound for Edinburgh Waverley Station. By the time we arrived at the station, it was already quite late. We took a city bus to the nearest stop to our accommodation — the West End Hotel. However, we still had to walk at least fifteen minutes to get to the hostel. Tired as we were, the walk through the cool, dimly lit streets of Edinburgh was exhilarating. The city felt alive, even at that hour, with its historic buildings and the crisp autumn air. As I stepped off the bus and set foot on Edinburgh’s cobblestone streets for the first time, I let out a deep breath. Finally, I thought, I’m here.
It was 23:56 GMT on the 1st of November, 2022 — a special time when the time returned to GMT, just as BST had gracefully ended with the last Sunday of October.
When we got to our hostel, we were expecting a spacious room. We had booked a room with two bunk beds, and the pictures from Airbnb made it look roomy enough. However, as it turned out, the room was — it was cozy but — far from spacious, it was so damn narrow! Let me explain: there was just one small (literally small idk the size but it really small I bet you) room with two bunk beds, each with three levels, which meant six beds in total. There was only one bathroom for six of us to share. Imagine, there were five of us plus one stranger — a man who was already half-asleep when we arrived. But despite all that, the hostel was pretty clean.
With our suitcases and tired bodies, we made quite a racket as we tried to figure out who would shower first, given that we all felt too damn stinky after our journey. I’m pretty sure our new roommate woke up, even if he pretended to sleep through our commotion. Sorry, bro, didn’t mean to be so noisy — we’re just tourists, after all.
The morning of November 2nd greeted my birthday with its own special charm — a veil of gloom and a soft, persistent drizzle. The sky was overcast, casting a muted, gray light over the city. It was the kind of weather that could make a city feel both cozy and melancholic. Despite the drizzle, we were determined not to let it dampen our spirits or waste any precious moments of our time here, so off we went.
Our first stop was Tesco, a short ten-minute walk away to pick up breakfast and I chose a cheese sandwich and a bottle of mineral water. The simple act of grabbing food felt like a small victory against the gray weather, fueling us for the day ahead.
With our breakfast in hand, we headed to our first destination: Dean Village. The village’s enchanting streets and picturesque landscapes offered a warm contrast to the dreary weather. We meandered through its cobbled paths and admired the historic charm of the old buildings, their facades softened by the rain. For about 40 minutes, we explored every nook and cranny, each corner revealing a new facet of the village’s beauty.
During our exploration, I took a moment to video-call my sister, she was studying at the library and ran outside when she heard I was in Edinburgh. She showed her excitement and called to wish me a happy birthday.
After a few photos and a chat with my sister, we continued our journey through Edinburgh. With no tight schedule or set itinerary, we allowed ourselves to drift through the city center, embracing the spontaneous rhythm of our exploration. The drizzle continued, creating a soothing backdrop to our wanderings.
The wind, however, proved to be a formidable challenge. It was so strong that when we tried to use our umbrella, it turned inside out in a comical twist of fate. We laughed at the absurdity of it all, the umbrella flapping helplessly against the gusts. Despite the weather’s attempts to thwart us, the experience was exhilarating and added a memorable touch to our day.
As we strolled through the city’s streets, we ended up at Ross Fountain. Ross Fountain evokes a sense of elegance and charm. The fountain’s ornate details and vibrant colors make it a striking focal point against the backdrop of Edinburgh’s historic architecture. Our each step was accompanied by the gentle sound of rain and the occasional burst of wind. The day’s weather, though dreary, felt like an integral part of the city’s atmosphere, enhancing the adventure rather than hindering it. It was a perfect start to my birthday in Edinburgh.
Without realizing it, noon had arrived. We decided to seek warmth from the chilly drizzle and stop at a Thai halal restaurant. The cozy atmosphere was a welcome refuge from the damp weather, and the warmth of the restaurant felt like a comforting embrace.
The restaurant, with its inviting ambiance and delicious food, provided a perfect break from our explorations. We enjoyed a hearty lunch, savoring the flavors, sharing stories and laughter. Unbeknownst to me, my friends had ordered a dessert and marked it as a birthday cake. It was a simple gesture that added a touch of magic to my already-sweet birthday. The dessert, with its rich and sweet taste, felt like a cherry on top of an already memorable day.
After lunch, we set off to explore another part of Edinburgh. Our next stop was Victoria Street, a vibrant and picturesque area known for its colorful buildings and charming shops. One of the shops we wandered into was a Harry Potter-themed store, where we soaked in the magical atmosphere and picked up a few souvenirs. We also took some photos of the rainbow arching across the city, adding a splash of color to the gray day.
As we explored, we lost track of time and soon noticed the sun began to set. The weather took a turn for the worse, with heavy rain and strong winds making it uncomfortable to be outside. We decided to take shelter in a nearby Mexican restaurant. Inside, it was just the three of us and the waitress. She gave us a complimentary cup of tea as a thank you for helping her get in the chairs and tables that got wet outside.
Meanwhile, our other two friends had different plans and had set off for Birmingham. As we waited for the rain to pass, we enjoyed burritos and relaxed in the warmth of the restaurant. The meal and the shelter provided a pleasant pause in our day, allowing us to regroup and watch as the day turned to dark. Then we decided to head back to the hostel. We were freezing and tired but ended up waiting about an hour for a city bus, and it took another hour to get back to the hostel.
Day two in Edinburgh began quite differently from the first. It was November 3rd, 2022, and the morning was bright and windy, the opposite of the previous day’s gloomy drizzle. It was also our last day in the city, so my friends and I decided to take it easy and enjoy a leisurely morning stroll in search of coffee.
We found a charming little café, Patisserie Florentin, near Circus Lane, about a 20-minute walk from the West End Hostel. I ordered a hazelnut latte and a cookie, a perfect start to the day. The warm coffee and sweet treat felt comforting, especially with the crisp morning air around us. After got fueled, we wandered around Circus Lane, snapping photos of the picturesque alley with its beautiful scenery. The small, charming street was filled with quaint houses and vibrant plants, making it a perfect spot for capturing memories.
Not too long, we headed to the Royal Botanic Garden to enjoy the fresh air and greenery. We spent about an hour strolling through the gardens, taking in the peaceful atmosphere. The morning was quiet, with a gentle breeze blowing through the trees, the sun was shining, making everything look vibrant and full of life. Not to forget, I bought a unique souvenir from the garden’s shop — a glass aromatherapy bottle featuring a gold tree design on a white background. It was a beautiful reminder of our time in Edinburgh, a keepsake that captured the serenity and beauty of the Royal Botanic Garden.
Feeling satisfied after wandering around the vast, peaceful garden, we made our way to the heart of Edinburgh — Princes Street. We returned to take in the sight of the iconic Scott Monument, a towering Gothic structure that never failed to impress. I found it to be the perfect spot for people-watching.
As we meandered, I could hear the beautiful instrumental music played by a street artist, adding a melodic backdrop to the lively scene. People strolled by, chatting and laughing with friends, their voices blending with the music. I noticed an elderly man sitting on a bench, engrossed in his newspaper, while others sat nearby, absorbed in their books. Some people rushed by, possibly late for work or trying to catch a bus, their hurried footsteps echoing on the pavement. There were also fellow tourists like us, with bright, curious expressions, taking in the sights and sounds of the city.
The streets were busy, full of life and energy. It was a perfect blend of the everyday hustle and the charm of a city rich in history and culture. Standing there, surrounded by the vibrancy of Edinburgh, I felt a sense of connection to the city and its people.
As we strolled down Leith Street, we stumbled upon Maki & Ramen. The sight of the steaming bowls of ramen was too tempting to resist, so we went in. The ramen was delicious — warm, flavorful, and exactly what we needed. And don’t worry, if you’re vegan or need a gluten-free option, you just need to inform the friendly staff about your dietary requirements. And for Muslim visitors, they offer Halal-certified chicken and beef dishes. As their slogan goes, “Vegan? Halal? Gluten-free? No problem. At Maki & Ramen, inclusivity is key.”
After enjoying our meal, we realized we didn’t have any set plans for the rest of the day. So, on a whim, we decided to head to Calton Hill. It only took us about four minutes to reach the entrance from Regent Road, where we began our hike. Yes, hike… but I think it’s worth it as Calton Hill is known for being one of the best places to visit in Edinburgh, and you know… it’s free.
The hike wasn’t too strenuous. Just four flights of stone steps and an uphill walk, making it a pleasant and manageable climb. It was a good bit of exercise, and we were rewarded with spectacular views of Edinburgh. From the top of Calton Hill, we could capture some of the most iconic photos of the city, including the breathtaking view of the Old Town. The panoramic scenery was worth every step, offering a perfect blend of Edinburgh’s historic and natural beauty.
There were so many things to explore at Calton Hill. As we walked around, we admired the impressive Playfair Monument and the towering Nelson Monument, which provides a stunning 360-degree view of Edinburgh if you climb to the top. We also visited the Collective Gallery, a center for contemporary art that showcases modern works in a historic setting. One of the most iconic sights was the Dugald Stewart Monument, a beautiful structure that stands out against the skyline, offering a perfect spot for taking photos.
Calton Hill isn’t just a place for great views; it’s rich in history too. The hill has been a significant site in Edinburgh for centuries, with its origins as a place of gathering dating back to the 16th century. It became a public park in 1724, making it one of the oldest public parks in Scotland. The various monuments on the hill, like the National Monument, are built to commemorate significant historical figures and events. For instance, the Nelson Monument was built to honor Admiral Horatio Nelson’s victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. The hill has long been a symbol of Scottish Enlightenment, representing both historical remembrance and cultural progress.
Exploring Calton Hill gave us a deeper appreciation of Edinburgh’s rich history and culture. We spent hours wandering around, taking in the sights and enjoying the peaceful atmosphere. It was a perfect way to wrap up our visit to Edinburgh, combining breathtaking views with a sense of connection to the city’s past.
Before we knew it, time gently nudged us to leave, pulling us from the embrace of this enchanting city. With a mix of reluctance and contentment, we made our way to the intercity bus bound for Glasgow, and from Buchanan Station, we set off back to London. As the bus moved away from Edinburgh, I took one last look at the city that had given me so much in such a short time.
These past two days were a vivid collection of memories — unexpected moments, stunning vistas, and cherished times with friends. Having my birthday here, in the city I had long dreamed of, turned a simple trip into a profound experience. I am deeply grateful for every second, every shared smile, and every view that left me breathless. This was a birthday to remember, and Edinburgh, with its rain-kissed streets and storied hills, will forever hold a piece of my soul.

Perched majestically on Scotland’s eastern coast, Edinburgh is a city that seamlessly blends its rich history with vibrant culture and ever-changing weather. From its ancient roots to its modern-day charm, Edinburgh offers a captivating tapestry of experiences that enthrall visitors from around the world.
Edinburgh’s history is woven into the very fabric of its streets, buildings, and monuments. Dating back over a thousand years, the city has witnessed the rise and fall of kingdoms, triumphs, and tribulations of its people.
At the heart of Edinburgh stands its most iconic landmark, Edinburgh Castle. Perched atop Castle Rock, this ancient fortress has stood guard over the city for centuries, its towering walls holding the secrets of Scotland’s past within its stone embrace. From its beginnings as a royal residence to its role in countless battles and conflicts, Edinburgh Castle is a testament to the city’s storied history.
The Royal Mile, a cobbled street that stretches from the castle to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, is a living museum of Edinburgh’s past. Lined with centuries-old buildings, including the striking St. Giles’ Cathedral and the imposing Parliament Hall, the Royal Mile is a treasure trove of historic sites and hidden gems waiting to be discovered.
Edinburgh’s cultural scene is as diverse and dynamic as the city itself. From world-class museums and galleries to lively festivals and events, there is always something to see, do, and experience.
Every August, the city comes alive with the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the world’s largest arts festival. With thousands of performances ranging from theatre and comedy to music and dance, the Fringe showcases the best of international talent against the backdrop of Edinburgh’s historic streets.
But Edinburgh’s cultural offerings extend far beyond the August month. The city is home to a thriving music scene, with venues ranging from intimate pubs to grand concert halls hosting performances by local musicians and international acts alike. Art galleries, such as the Scottish National Gallery and the Fruitmarket Gallery, offer a glimpse into the world of Scottish and international art, while theaters like the Edinburgh Playhouse and the Traverse Theatre provide a stage for cutting-edge drama and entertainment.
One cannot speak of Edinburgh’s weather without mentioning its well-known unpredictability. Like its cultural offers, the city’s climate is diverse, ranging from intense sunshine to unexpected downpours.
Summer brings long days and mild temperatures, perfect for exploring Edinburgh’s outdoor attractions, such as Arthur’s Seat and the Royal Botanic Garden. Autumn paints the city in hues of gold and crimson, while winter transforms it into a winter wonderland, with the Christmas markets and Hogmanay celebrations adding a festive air to the city streets.
But it is perhaps in spring that Edinburgh truly shines. As the city awakens from its winter slumber, the parks and gardens burst into bloom, filling the air with the scent of flowers and the sound of birdsong. It is a time of renewal and rebirth when Edinburgh comes alive with the promise of warmer days ahead.
Edinburgh is a city of contrasts: ancient yet modern, traditional yet progressive, unpredictable yet endlessly captivating. With its rich history, vibrant culture, and ever-changing weather, Edinburgh offers a unique and unforgettable experience to all who visit its storied streets. Whether you’re exploring the historic landmarks of the Old Town, immersing yourself in the excitement of the Fringe Festival, or simply watching the clouds roll in over the Firth of Forth, Edinburgh is a city that never fails to leave its mark on the hearts and minds of all who wander its winding pathways.

The next day we took a taxi. After dropping us at the Royal Mile the driver suggested that we take a hop on and hop off bus and the ticket would be valid for 24 hours. With this ticket we would be able to see many of the attractions there, if we were short of time.
So, we took the help of a tourist bus to visit the popular Edinburgh castle. The bus was top open, meant for sightseeing. We had heard a lot about this historic Castle, and we were excited to visit the world-famous Castle. When I read about it on various websites, I never thought I would be able to be there one day.
Edinburgh Castle, owned by the Scottish Government, sees millions of tourists each year and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
It rises above the old town from the top of the Royal Mile. Because the volcanic rock that the castle sits on rises sharply from all sides, the only feasible entrance is on the east, along the cobblestone thoroughfare that is the Royal Mile.

Posted: 12/4/2023 | December 4th, 2023
I never get tired of visiting Edinburgh. I love the enchanting cobblestone streets, the world-class whisky bars, the plethora of free museums, and arty vibe of the city (it’s the inspiration for many, many writers).
It has been Scotland’s capital since the 15th century and has a history that stretches back millennia (humans have been in the area since 8500 BCE). There’s an epic medieval castle, an ancient volcano, the historic Old Town, and the New Town (both of which are UNESCO World Heritage sites).
One of the best ways to soak it all up is by taking a walking tour. While ghost tours are some of the most popular here (Edinburgh is supposedly one of the most haunted cities in the world), there are many other tours to experience, from bike tours to food tours to pub crawls.
Here’s my list of the best walking tours in Edinburgh to help you plan your trip, save money, and make the most out of your stay!
Best Overall Tour
Learn More
This family-owned company specializes in a variety of tours of the vaults under the city (a labyrinth of tunnels that were first used as storage and workshop space for businesses in the early 17th century), and it’s the only company to offer vault tours during the day. Adult-only tours include the infamous Canongate graveyard and there are even vault tours designed for kids.
Tours start at 20 GBP.
Best Free Tour
Learn More
City Explorers runs four different free walking tours daily. Start with the classic Edinburgh Free Tour, on which you’ll see and learn about the main sights, including Edinburgh Castle, the Royal Mile, and St Giles’ Cathedral. There’s also a free ghost tour, a free Harry Potter tour, and a free New Town tour as well. Just remember to tip your guide at the end!
While those two are my top recommendations for tours in Edinburgh, here are a few more options to help you make the most of your time here:
Food is an important part of every culture. Scotland has all manner of interesting culinary delights, and the best way to learn more about them (while sampling a bunch) is by taking a food tour. Secret Food Tours offers the best one in Edinburgh. On their three-hour classic tour of Edinburgh’s Old Town, you’ll try delicacies like haggis, creamy Scottish cheese, neeps, and tatties (and learn what those even are), as well as enjoy traditional Scottish tea.
If you want to try more local spirits, you can take the Secret Whisky, Gin, & Beyond tour, which includes seven tastings of locally brewed and distilled liquors.
Prices start at 69 EUR.
Book here!
To cover more ground and get out of town a bit, take a bike tour. A Wee Pedal has several different offerings, so you can see more of Edinburgh and its surrounding countryside on two wheels. The most popular tour is the 20-mile loop tour, which circumnavigates the entire city. There’s also a 12-mile version that goes out to the rugged coastline for a more off-the-beaten-path adventure.
While rides are taken at a meandering, comfortable pace, you can also rent an e-bike for an extra 15 GBP if you’re not up for the challenge. You can also book special private tours, including one that ends at a brewery (tasting included), and a mountain bike tour.
Prices start at 65 GBP.
Book here!
If you’re looking to get genuinely creeped out, take a tour with City of the Dead. They offer several tours that go through the underground vaults. City of the Dead is also the only tour company with access to the ominously named Black Mausoleum and Covenanter’s Prison, some of the most haunted places in the world. These spots are favorites of the Mackenzie Poltergeist, considered one of the world’s best-documented supernatural entities, with hundreds of supposed encounters. It’s one of my favorite tours in the city!
Prices start at 19 GBP.
Book here!
One of TripAdvisor’s Top 10 Things to Do in the UK, the Mountebank Comedy Walk, run by Daniel Downie, an award-winning stand-up comedian, is undoubtedly the most hilarious way to see Auld Reekie (an old nickname for the city). On this tour you’ll laugh and learn not only about Edinburgh but all things Scottish, from culture to history to some famous (and infamous) people. And if you’re lucky, Daniel’s adorable dog Bonnie Prince might even join you.
Prices start at 22 GBP.
Book here!
One of the biggest walking tour companies in the UK, See Your City offers several fun tours in Edinburgh. Their best (and most popular) is the Harry Potter walking tour, on which you’ll visit the places that inspired JK Rowling as she penned her famous series (and the café where she did so). You’ll even get sorted into your Hogwarts house and get to test your book and movie knowledge in a quiz to earn points. It’s a super fun tour and a must for Harry Potter fans.
Other unique See Your City tours in Edinburgh include a Cheese Crawl and a True Crime walking tour.
Prices start at 16 GBP.

Heading into Edinburgh on the tram, I couldn’t help but feel that I had missed the memo that the Fringe had a dress code and that it was hiking gear.
Everyone around me was wearing a backpack over a waterproof coat and hiking trousers or jeans. The weather forecast had predicted rain, but I felt more like I was heading into the mountains than the centre of a major city from the attire of the crowd. I stood out rather a lot with my skirt and handbag.
I had little experience of arts festivals, but I had expected there might be some more interesting clothing choices. I would have to wait until I reached the Royal Mile to find the more experimental outfits.
Disembarking on Princes Street, my companion and I decided to stroll around Princes Street Gardens before heading up to the Royal Mile. This park offers possibly the best view of the castle and how the rock on which it sits rises steeply up from the comparatively flat gardens below.
It’s well worth a detour to see the memorial to Wojtek the Bear who served in the Polish army during World War II. No, I’m not joking. After the war, Wojtek accompanied his comrades to Scotland. They feared a return to Poland would see him used as propaganda by communist authorities, so he lived out his days in Edinburgh Zoo, where he died in 1963. The memorial depicts him with his caretaker Peter Prendys and features scenes from his life.
We then followed the stream of people heading up the steep street (rather appropriately named The Mound) to reach the Royal Mile, the historic street which runs from the Scottish Parliament Building up to Edinburgh Castle. The railing separating the Gardens from the street was covered in posters advertising acts performing at the Fringe. The sheer number of shows was quite impressive — how could the city have enough venues for all these acts to perform daily, I wondered.
One poster in particular caught our attention: the title “Swamplesque: the burlesque parody — uncover all the layers” printed above an image of a woman painted green and dressed like Shrek. I can’t vouch for the quality of the show, but it certainly did a good job at standing out from the crowd of other adverts.
Once we had completed the climb, we were greeted by a group of young people in blue jumpsuits who were stood on traffic bollards and giving a rather lacklustre performance of Uptown Funk. Although this was amusing at first, once we returned to the area a bit later in the day and found they were still singing only this one song on repeat, I started to wonder if they were driving business away from the cafés and tourist shops nearby. The singers weren’t bad, but their trombone player’s performance left a lot to be desired. And who wants to hear Bruno Mars all day anyway?
We crossed the Royal Mile and headed downhill again along George IV Bridge to visit one of the city’s essential tourist stops: The Elephant House. The café opened in 1995 and soon became famous as the location where J. K. Rowling wrote the early Harry Potter books. The business has really capitalised on its link to the author (and who can blame it?), styling itself the “birthplace” of Harry Potter and catering to the tourists who flock to Edinburgh for the city’s somewhat loose connection to the series — although Rowling lived and wrote here, the novels do not take place in the city.
This hasn’t stopped a whole industry giving Harry Potter tours and selling Harry Potter merchandise from developing in the city. I’ve observed the same phenomenon in Cambridge, a city which has even less to do with Harry Potter. This technicality doesn’t seem to prevent tourists enthusiastically spending their money on fake wands and Hedwig keyrings. It’s rather telling that there are Chinese and Spanish versions of the café’s website, as this is hardly the norm in the UK.
Sadly, the café was recently damaged in a fire. But, for now, tourists can visit its second location, which is just around the corner on Victoria Street, a picturesque lane lined by brightly coloured shop fronts. When we arrived, The Elephant House had a rather conspicuous crowd around the entrance, making it hard to miss.
Popping in to have a look at the new location, we were greeted by Harry Potter merch and a takeaway menu that had certainly changed since Rowling frequented the café in the 90s.
Patrons have to head upstairs to reach the café proper. Despite it not yet being 30 minutes since the café opened, there was already a queue. The patrons didn’t seem to care that this wasn’t really where Rowling wrote Harry Potter as they passed the time posing for photos.
We decided to find somewhere without a queue and headed back up to the Royal Mile to Deacon’s House Café. This historic café was almost unchanged from when we had visited several years ago, only much busier with the Fringe crowd.
The ground floor of the café was once the workshop of Deacon Brodie, an 18th-century gentleman by day and head of a gang of burglars by night. Brodie’s double life supposedly inspired Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.
The wall of the café is decorated by a mural which depicts scenes from the novella alongside significant episodes in Scottish history while the courtyard offers a quiet spot just off the bustling Royal Mile for a cup of tea and a cake in classic British fashion.
It was while walking down the Royal Mile that I finally saw the eccentric outfits I had been expecting. The streets around St Giles’ Cathedral were packed, tourists stopping to watch an eclectic range of performers.
While gazing up at the impressive St Giles’ Cathedral, I heard someone behind me say, “it’s like Midsommar.” Turning around, I saw what he meant: a group of young women in long white dresses and flower crowns were flailing in slow motion in the centre of the street. One was even sat on the ground and caressing the cobblestones.
The usual street performers were also out in force. As we stopped to look at a living statue painted in silver, we could hear a shout of “this next one is Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls” from a busker around the corner. Looking up at the church, I wondered whether the street had been this chaotic in the days when the Scottish Reformer John Knox preached there.
We found our path blocked by a crowd so large that I had to stand on my toes and strain my neck to see what they were watching, since all I could see was the top half of a man wobbling from side to side. It turned out he was balancing on a ladder, wearing a kilt and holding juggling clubs in one hand. It seemed we had arrived just as he had paused his act to address the crowd.
After asking how many of the crowd weren’t from the UK and receiving a lukewarm cheer in response, he went on to lecture us all on how much he loved immigration and how bad fascism is. I imagine anyone who had just wanted a nice day out to forget about about the depressing state of modern Britain would have been sadly disappointed by this reminder of the tense political situation in our country.
Perhaps I was naïve to think the political lectures would be limited to the comedy venues. Besides, what possesses a man clowning about on the street to think anyone will take his political opinions seriously is a mystery to me.
Edging past the crowd, we continued down the High Street, dodging people offering us flyers every few metres. As we turned onto North Bridge, a girl complimented me on my skirt, reassuring me that I wasn’t overdressed.
It was actually a coincidence that we were visiting Edinburgh during the Fringe. Nevertheless, it seemed a missed opportunity not to go to at least one show while we were there. On personal recommendation, we decided to give 4 Funny Feckers a chance. Since the show consists of the comedian Wes Dalton introducing four different acts, we thought it wouldn’t be so bad even if we didn’t like them, as they would only be on stage for 10–15 minutes each.
The venue was the basement of the The Hanover Tap bar. To take our seats, we had to squeeze ourselves between rows of folding metal chairs that were crammed uncomfortably close together. It was easy to understand the host Wes Dalton’s success as he bantered back and forth with some eccentric audience members. The final act, the Spanish comedian Sergi Polo, left me with a feeling of envy at how easily he could crack jokes in his second language, a feat I can only dream of achieving, despite my best efforts.
So, would I recommend visiting Edinburgh during the Fringe? Yes and no. Yes, because it’s certainly worth experiencing all the inevitable weirdness of the world’s largest arts festival. No, because if your goal is to see the city itself, you’d be much better off visiting at a time when the crowds are smaller and the hotel prices less exorbitant. As much as I enjoyed doing a quick tour of Edinburgh, my next visit will almost certainly be at a different time of year.

We didn’t know what to expect when we stepped out of Waverly Place in Edinburgh after a horrible train ride of sitting on the floor due to the rail strikes.
As we carried our bags up several flights of stairs because the escalator was broken, we were out of breath and had a minute to take in our surroundings.
To our right was a creepy, black, gothic-looking structure.
“Whoa, what is that?!” It looked like some kind of medieval church.
Entranced as we walked to our Airbnb, we stumbled upon more dark architecture. The buildings are incredible in Edinburgh and look like something out of a gothic movie.
As we trekked along, little did we know that our half-mile walk would be mostly stairs. We were lugging around our heavy bags, backpacks, and our limbs were tired from the previous days of walking.
Even though the weather was cool, we show up at the Airbnb out of breath and sweaty. Note to self: take a taxi back to the train station.
After we check in with our host, we notice the view of Edinburgh Castle from our window. Another example of the incredible architecture was just a…

EDINBURGH is a beautiful city, filled with a rich history and colourful characters. It’s quite compact and walkable.
The mediaeval Old Town, which extends from Edinburgh Castle to the Palace of Holyroodhouse via the Royal Mile, is a great place to stroll about.
Here is the main tourist entrance to the castle, being guarded by a soldier of the Black Watch.
The statues that flank the entrance are of Robert the Bruce and William Wallace, who both fought against the English king Edward I in the Middle Ages when he tried to conquer Scotland. The red lion is a symbol of Scotland. The motto, Nemo me Impune Lacessit, means ‘let no-one disrespect me and get away with it’.
I wonder whether the projecting gutters at the top were used to pour boiling oil on its would-be conquerors? These included the Scots themselves when they tried to take it back from the English in a charge led by Robert the Bruce.
The statue that is on the left as you walk in, the one that is of Robert the Bruce, was created by a Scottish sculptor named Thomas Clapperton, who also has two works in the New Zealand town of Oamaru: The Wonderland Statue in a local children’s garden, and the statue that was created for Oamaru’s World War One memorial. You can see pictures of those statues here. So, that’s an amazing Kiwi link with Edinburgh Castle!
The castle also has cannons, which were last fired in earnest during the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745/46, when the castle was in the hands of the British government but the city had fallen to the Jacobites, supporters of the Stuart dynasty, which had been ousted after the death of the childless Queen Anne. It’s all very Game of Thrones.
The castle also has an impressive Great Hall as well as many other sights. These include the Scottish Crown Jewels, which no ordinary person is allowed to photograph.
You can get great views of the city from Edinburgh Castle, as in the next photograph.
There is lovely parkland just below the castle, as well. This park is called the Princes Street Gardens. It contains lots of statues, and I was very much struck by a monument to a poet of the 1700s named Allan Ramsay.
Here are some other street scenes, just to let you know that Edinburgh does have ordinary streets, after all. Though even these are pretty funky, for instance, the Old Tollbooth Wynd, or alley.
One thing I found interesting was the symbol of a deer with a cross in its antlers, which you can see on top of the old tollbooth and also on top of the building below, the Canongate Church on the Royal Mile. The statue just to the right, which looks like a real person at first, is of another poet of the 1700s, Robert Fergusson.
The deer with the cross represents a vision experienced by a saint named Hubert, who was a fanatical hunter but who, after spying a deer with a cross glowing between its antlers, devoted his life to being kind to animals thereafter.
(The same symbol appears on bottles of a German spirit called Jägermeister, meaning master hunter. The makers of Jägermeister have lately had to defend the use of St Hubert’s vision against the charge that it was an offence to religion to put it on a booze bottle. But I digress …)
Here is another interesting one. The Scots dialect, or language, is like English but full of words that are used differently. For instance, in Scots flesh is meat but in standard English flesh is what people are made of. So, ‘Fleshmarket’ looks kind of creepy to anyone who isn’t Scottish.
I also visited the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where most of the devolved Scottish government is now based. Holyroodhouse has also been a royal palace for many centuries, with perhaps its most famous occupant Mary, Queen of Scots, the queen that Elizabeth I of England imprisoned in the Tower of London and then beheaded. The great complex of Holyroodhouse includes the Queen’s Gallery, now an art gallery, with a Scottish red lion in a different pose.
I took quite a lot of photos of Holyroodhouse, or Holyrood Palace, when I was in Edinburgh a few years ago, and included them in collages for my book A Maverick Pilgrim Way. Here are some of the collages. The first photo is of another monument in the Princes Street Gardens, while the rest are of Holyrood.
This is another interesting symbol at Holyrood. It dates back to the time of the Scottish king James V (r. 1513–1542). Legend had it that only king could command a unicorn, shown duly chained, and so the unicorn was an important symbol of Scottish royal authority in those days.
Which is probably also where the all-British lion and unicorn device comes from as well. I think the lettering I R S probably stands for James (or Iames), Rex (king) of Scotland.
The Old Town is overlooked by an extinct volcano called Arthur’s Seat, from which you can get more views of the city. Here is a view of the city with the castle at the right and Arthur’s Seat at the left in the early 1700s.
The sketch is dedicated to Queen Anne, the last of the Scottish Stuart dynasty, who reigned over Great Britain and Ireland in the heyday of the real-life pirates of the Caribbean, and after whom the legendary real-life pirate ship Queen Anne’s Revenge was named.
Arthur’s seat is close to the centre of a park called Holyrood Park, which is both bigger and wilder than the Princes Street Gardens, a large area of raw nature in the middle of Edinburgh, though it was on the edge of town in Queen Anne’s day.
Here is a video of my rambles through the castle, the Royal Mile, up Arthur’s Seat, and in front of the Palace of Holyroodhouse, which was unfortunately closed to the public this time around because of Covid. But you could still watch the changing of the guard.
The nearby New Town has that name because it was laid out in the eighteenth century, which is new by Scottish standards.
The New Town has lots of parks itself, and grand circles and squares. It served as an inspiration for Washington DC and also for the New Zealand city of Dunedin, a name that means Edinburgh in Gaelic.
Edinburgh is also a city of great learning. This fact, along with the ancient Greek or Roman-style architecture of much of the New Town, caused the city to be nicknamed ‘the Athens of the North’.
In a similar vein, Calton Hill, which sports several monuments, is known as Edinburgh’s Acropolis.
When I was in Edinburgh a few years ago, Aunty June and I went to the castle at that time as well. We visited the St Margaret’s Chapel, part of Edinburgh Castle, built in the twelfth century and one of the oldest surviving buildings built in Edinburgh.
I have lost count of the number of times I have visited Edinburgh Castle, but let me tell you it never ceases to amaze and thrill me.
My grandmother had told Aunty June stories about how she, when she was a child, used to go to Edinburgh Castle and swing on the gates. I stood at the same gates for a little while and imagined what it would have been like for my grandmother to swing on them.
On that earlier visit, I also went to the Fringe Festival held annually in Edinburgh, which I loved. The Fringe Festival began in the 1940s as an add-on to an official, but rather stuffy, festival of the arts held in Edinburgh. The Fringe Festival showcased the acts that didn’t make it into the official Edinburgh festival. It soon acquired the reputation of being the more interesting place to hang out!
So, Edinburgh isn’t all old stuff by any means!
When I was there the previous time, I also went to the port district of Leith, where my grandmother was from.
This time around, things were a bit different. As I mention up by the video, Holyroodhouse was closed because of Covid.
You have to book online to get into the castle, as the numbers are restricted for the same reason. They told me at the castle that they let two hundred people in every half an hour, and cap the numbers at four hundred, and don’t allow more than five thousand in a day. Which I thought was a very good policy.
I’d never seen the Royal Mile so empty, even though there was a cruise ship in town.
In fact, the comparative absence of tourists was why I scaled Arthur’s Seat this time around, for the first time. It had always been too busy before.
Finally, car parking in Edinburgh is an absolute nightmare. I think I ended up paying about forty pounds for the day because I didn’t get in before eleven o’clock, and thus missed out on early-bird deals. Parking a bit further out of town and using public transport is a much better idea, if you are organised enough.
In my next post, I visit the Cairngorms National Park and Inverness!

At the end of May, I spent some time in Edinburgh exploring different parts of Scottish history. During my days in the city, I visited three places:
So, here is everything I wanted to share from my trip, starting with Mary King’s Close.
Mary King’s Close
Mary King’s Close was a real close in Edinburgh until the Edinburgh City Chambers Building was built on top of it between 1753–1761. They did this by removing the top floors from the houses and built the foundations on the lower floors, so the close is underground, but when it was a residential area, it wouldn’t have been. The last resident was called Andrew Chesney, a saw maker. He lived with his wife Margaret until 1897, when they were forced to move due to the Royal Exchange buying the area for extension purposes. However, Chesney was still able to work on the Close. Then in 2003, the public were able to go on guided tours around the close after Continuum Attractions opened The Real Mary King’s Close.
The close’s name was taken from a resident of the close: Mary King, who lived in the close from 1635 (when it was documented that she was a resident) until her death in…

When I first arrived in Edinburgh, I wasn’t sure what to expect. I’d only heard good things, but I was coming from continental Europe and to be honest, I wasn’t sure anywhere in the UK could beat the beauty of Spain, Portugal, or any other European country I visited. But Edinburgh proved me wrong!
While I only spent five days in Edinburgh, I’m already wanting to go back and for longer. This travel guide will help you fall in love with Edinburgh on your first (or next) trip to this dark academia paradise.
Edinburgh is known for many things, some fact, some fiction. It was the late Queen Elizabeth II’s favorite city, the place which inspired many iconic Harry Potter locations, and home to the largest performing arts festival in the world.
While Edinburgh has always been a worldly city, with many medieval and enlightenment scholars calling it home, the city has had its struggles over the years. Many movements against the British government sprouted up throughout the centuries and it was the central location for executions in Scotland. Talk about a deadly good time.

The village of Glencoe, Scotland is known for its incredible hiking, nature and landscape. However, if you fly into Edinburgh (as many tourists do) you will quickly realize that it, along with the rest of the highlands, are pretty hard to get to. Specifically, it takes around 3 hours to get to Glencoe by car and almost 4.5 hours via public transport. Renting a car is expensive and taking public transport restricts your schedule to that of trains and buses.
On my recent trip to Edinburgh I faced this conundrum — I really wanted to do a day hike, however, I did not want to deal with renting a car and driving all the way to the highlands. This is when I discovered The Pentlands. A hilly nature preserve located just 20 minutes from Edinburgh city center, these hills (or maybe even mini-mountains) are perfect for a day hike without much planning. If you want incredible views of Edinburgh along with the surrounding Scottish countryside The Pentlands are a great option.
While I am definitely not the resident expert on The Pentlands or other hikes near Edinburgh, I want to provide a guide based on my own experience. The following guide is purely anecdotal and illustrates steps that are specific to my travel style. That being said, hopefully it is still helpful in some way. I really did not see many guides on hiking the Pentlands available online when I was looking to get there — hopefully this clarifies some things!
While staying in Edinburgh I tried to research the closest entrance point to the park from the city. I found that Midlothian Snowsports Centre in Hillend provides a more lowkey trail entrance. If you’re staying in Edinburgh city center this entrance is only 23 minutes by car and at the time of my trip cost me only 10£ by Uber. If you’re looking for an even cheaper option the number 15 bus line to Easter Brush stops directly at the Snowsports Center and runs fairly frequently from Princes Street in the center of the city. Either option is great, just make sure you have a plan to get back into the city after your hike (I will talk more about this later)!
So when I finally got to Midlothian Snowsports Centre I was pretty confused on how to actually get into The Pentlands. After some searching I spoke with the desk clerk at the Snowsports center and made my way over to the right of the building. Up that direction is a very inconspicious trail head gently sloping upwards into the park itself. While its very easy to miss, its totally worth the climb! Below is an annotated map depicting the entrance, as you can see its to the right and very lowkey.
As you can probably see in the photo above, the entrance trail was nothing more than a dirt road running up into the rolling Scottish hills — perfect! Its worth noting that this entrance path splits into two options: one steeper and one more gradual, both incline to the top of Caerketton Hill (in the background horizon of the photo). I really enjoyed this part of the hike, the view just kept getting better and better.
Now i’d be lying if I said this was an easy uphill walk. While I did take the steeper path, i’d definitely be prepared for a workout! The view are really super worth it — you can slowly see all of Edinburgh spread out below you.
Honestly pictures don’t do it justice. At Caerketton Hill peak you can see the vast majority of The Pentlands sprawled out ahead of you. To get to the top of Caerketton Hill it definitely takes ~30 minutes, which really isn’t bad if you want some incredible views of the city and the rest of the park. If you’re like me and need a few hours of walking to be satisfied you can continue to follow the trail deeper and deeper into the Scottish countryside; however, if you’re done you can just as easily turn back to the snow center and get a beer in the city.
Here’s the view facing away from Edinburgh (and deeper into the park itself). You can totally see the long sprawling trails the seem to go on forever. You can also see some pretty cool sheep that I tried to pet, but they were clearly not interested.
Now above is route that I took through the park. Overall I highly recommend planning your exit strategy ahead of time. In general I found that this route was a perfect mix for adventure/direction for me. The majority kept me on trails climbing and descending the rolling hill, while the end added a bit of spontaneity to my journey.
What do I mean by spontaneity? Well, I did not exactly plan my trip back into Edinburgh. This got me stuck crossing private fields and a military base to actually make it back to the main road (A702). While the views were still awesome (see below), I only recommend it if you’re up for an adventure. If you want a more legit route you can easily circle backwards to the snowcenter or continue further on.
There really aren’t any towns along A702 in the location that this spit me out at. Because of this, I recommend bringing a phone with plenty of charge to call an Uber back into the city. My phone was dead at this point and I ended up hitchhiking back to the nearest metro station.
Overall I think my entire hike took ~4.5 hours so I was able to leave around 9:30 am and be back just in time for lunch. Not bad for less than a 30 minute ride. Next time I go to Scottland, I really hope to checkout the Highlands, however, if you’re limited on time (like I was) I recommend checking out The Pentlands! If you made it here, thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed my story/guide.

One of the things I do when visiting a place I’ve never been is look at the real estate for sale. As a retired real property attorney from the U.S. who has a passion for real estate, it’s just something that I do. If I’m really into the city, I will check out neighborhoods and look into what is available in the areas I find.
That is how I learned about Dean Village. It’s a tourist destination, a popular place, I learned on Instagram. The photos below will show you why. For me, it was simply adjacent to a neighborhood with apartments that looked like somewhere I would live. Given several places to check out, we started from Marchmont and headed to the Village.
We discovered the Water of Leith Walkway once we crossed the bridge in Dean Village, trying to find a shortcut to an apartment I wanted to see. There were few tourists on the path, and we found a calm, relaxed place to enjoy in the city’s heart.
I could live here. (No, we didn’t look inside nor at the price.)
We strolled the city over the next few days and found a bookstore, other pubs, and city art that we liked. The bookstore appealed to me for its proclamation and selection of books that most stores don’t bother carrying.
I needed food at that moment, and this pub had good food. I learned that most pubs in Scotland do not serve food-they are only bars. This is different from London, where we’d just been.
Ah, another book. Well, I’m a writer. What do you expect?
Will I return? I already have plans. The landlord will challenge me to RUN up to Arthur’s Seat this time, I’m pretty sure.
For all the photos of Edinburgh, visit my website.

First, the poem: It’s called Edinburgh’s Hills
Once there was a town they called Dun Eidieann.It was built around a castle on a hill.The town grew south and east and west but not northBecause of what was at the bottom of the hill.
So they built an artificial lake out of that bottom.And then threw trash and even bodies down the hill.And Loch Nor soon became a sewer.So they drained the lake and built an artificial hill.
Then they went to work on building Georgian New TownAnd placed their monuments on Calton Hill.And then they thought they would extend the Glasgow railroad.So they tunneled through that artificial hill.
It took a million carts of dirt from New Town To build The Mound, that artificial hill.Then they built the National Gallery of ScotlandAnd planted shrubs and trees on their new hill.
Now people congregate at New Town’s GardensAnd gaze at the fort on Old Town’s hill.Then they walk the Royal Mile to the castleAnd look down at New Town from Castle Hill.
2. And now, the pictures:
We would leave our New Town hotel at Picardy Place every day and walk up Leith Street, passing two giraffes on our left and the St James Shopping Centre on the right.
Shops were closing in 2016 and the old shopping centre was about to be demolished while the new shopping centre was being constructed. It’s called St James Quarter now but back then its name was Edinburgh St James.
Sometimes we dawdled along Princes Street. At other times we just walked across North Bridge over Waverly train station to reach the Royal Mile in Old Town.
On the Royal Mile we examined the shops and the bars and the street performers.
The Royal Mile runs from Edinburgh Castle on the western top of the hill to Holyrood Palace at the eastern bottom. It’s pretty much a straight line on top of the ridge but the street names change from Castle Hill to Lawnmarket to High Street to Canongate.
One day we walked to the top of the Royal Mile and visited the Castle and the National War Museum of Scotland and admired the views of Princes Street and New Town.
On yet another day we visited the National Museum of Scotland in Old Town and then had lunch at the Elephant House nearby.
J.K. Rowling wrote most of her first Harry Potter novel at the Elephant House.
In the above photo, New Town’s Princes Street and the Scott Monument are on the left. In the background, the Balmoral Hotel is to the left of North Bridge and the buildings on the right are in Old Town. North Bridge connects to the Royal Mile about halfway between the Castle and the Palace.
Uh-oh, I think I am getting farther behind other writers involved in this challenge. I better get going on the letter F! But first I am going to check out the latest A-Z stories by Sam Millichap, Adrienne Beaumont, Michael Rhodes, Anne Bonfert, Jillian Amatt - Artistic Voyages, Robert G. Longpré, Nishan Fuard, and Darren Weir.

I’ve never set foot in Edinburgh, but somehow, it feels like I belong there. In my mind, I stroll down its cobblestone streets, surrounded by centuries of history. There’s something about the city’s ancient charm that draws me in, where the buildings, weathered by time, seem to echo stories of old money and aristocratic elegance. It’s a place where history feels alive, woven into the fabric of every corner.
I imagine cozy, rainy days spent in small cafés, much like where J.K. Rowling penned Harry Potter, sipping a cup of hot chocolate as the mist rolls in. The city has that romantic, almost cinematic quality – a place where you can lose yourself in a quiet bookshop, or watch the world go by from a window seat, feeling at peace.
Edinburgh feels like an escape from the chaos, where life moves at a slower pace and the people are warm, inviting. It’s a place of inspiration, where every stone, every hidden alley seems to have a story waiting to be told. Though I’ve never been there, the thought of it feels like home. One day, I’ll find my way to those rain-soaked streets, to the city that already holds a piece of my heart.

We visited Scotland in 2016, dividing our time between Edinburgh and Glasgow. When I mentioned our plans to my sister Betty, she recommended that I take a look at a series of novels about a wealthy woman named Isabel Dalhousie who lives in Edinburgh where she edits a magazine on ethics and on the side gathers her group of friends together, usually on Sundays, to solve murder mysteries. She calls her little group The Sunday Philosophy Club, which is the title of the first book in a series that has now reached 17.
The Isabel Dalhousie books are the product of a rather prolific writer named Alexander McCall Smith, a noted legal scholar who was born in Botswana (when it was called Rhodesia) and became an expert on medical law. McCall Smith moved to Edinburgh in the 1950s when he became a professor of medical law and bioethics at the University of Edinburgh. He decided to become a full-time writer in 2005 and he still produces three or four books a year. Some of them are children’s books, some are detective series (The № 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency, 44 Scotland Street and a few others), and some are academic textbooks. And he manages to crank out an Isabel Dalhousie mystery just about every year.
Edinburgh was once divided into two parts. We have the Old Town on the hill with Edinburgh Castle on the top and the Palace of Holyrood House on the bottom. In between is the Royal Mile where all the tourists hang out. University students, too. Then we have what is called New Town which is mostly north of Old Town and is mostly flat. New Town is almost as old as Old Town. Princes Street, the main street in New Town, is at the base of the Old Town hill and runs parallel to the Royal Mile. Modern Edinburgh has spread out in all directions from Old Town and New Town.
Isabel lives in Bruntsfield south of Edinburgh’s Old Town. We resided on the eastern edge of New Town during our week-long stay in Edinburgh. Every day we walked westward to Old Town and the Royal Mile. We never walked as far as Bruntsfield, though.
In The Sunday Philosophy Club, she attends a concert and witnesses a man falling to his death. The police say it was an accident. She thinks he was pushed. The Sunday group ponders over the matter, bringing up matters involving Immanuel Kant and other philosophers, and of course solve the mystery.
I only read four of the Isabel Dalhousie books, skipping # 4 through 12 and going right to # 13, which McCall had just completed prior to our trip in 2016. It is called Sweet, Thoughtful Valentine and is really just a short story and only available as an eBook. In this book Isabel ponders over a moral dilemma involving a promise she made to a friend. In typical McCall Smith fashion, she wanders to her favorite cafe on Dundas Street, then visits an antique shop and an auctioneer nearby where she meets an old friend and makes her promise. The two then ride on a bus back to Bruntsfield. The story continues with scenes involving Isabel’s niece Cat, and another friend who is also involved in the auction. We also breeze through scenes involving Isabel’s husband Jamie and their son Charlie. The climax occurs when Isabel returns to the auction house to attend the auction. No murders in this story.
Since 2016 McCall Smith has written four more books in the series. But I moved on to Spain shortly after returning home from Scotland and began reading memoirs by pilgrims on the Camino, preparing for our trip to Spain in 2017.
If I ever return to Scotland, I will probably devote some of my time to rereading some of my favorite works by Scottish authors Arthur Conan Doyle and Robert Louis Stevenson. Both had roots in Edinburgh, but Sherlock Holmes did most of his detective work in London and Stevenson’s children adventures featured Scottish heroes, but he concentrated on Europe, America and the South Seas for his travel books.
You can find more details about our trip to Edinburgh in my Crow Canyon Journal blog here, here, and here.

In contrast to my hometown of Glasgow which, said with total affection of course, can slightly give off a post-soviet energy, Edinburgh certainly looks like a capital city, as far as surface appearances go. Not only does it house Scotland’s arguably most important cultural site, Edinburgh Castle, but it’s unexpectedly a major financial epicentre; unexpectedly because it doesn’t feel like it at all. In a lot of ways, Edinburgh is more small town than big city. It’s important to note though, that this charming city of old is very clearly becoming one of the world’s major melting pots — attracting students & professionals from all corners of the world. Apparent in the recent addition of certain world-famous brands like The W Hotel to their roster of places to be. So, in the ever wise words of Miss Molly-Mae, we all have the same 24 hours— and so this is how I’d spend mine in the city of Edinburgh.
“In a lot of ways, Edinburgh is more small town than big city.”
Arriving at Waverley train station will put you slap-bang in the middle of Princes Street in the city’s New Town district. On your right will be the Balmoral Hotel housing the glorious Palm Court, in which they host Edinburgh’s (alleged) best afternoon tea.
One of many Harry Potter references in this city is that JK Rowling alleged she finished the Harry Potter series while staying in a suite in this hotel. She left a bust of Hermes in her room, upon which she inscribed “JK Rowling finished writing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in this room (552) on 11th Jan 2007” — and the room has since been known as the J.K. Rowling Suite. The bust still sits in the room, though now surrounded by a glass case. A far cry from the dribs & drabs of back-street coffee shops where it’s said she had written “parts” of the previous books in Edinburgh’s Old Town.
Speaking of Old Town, and starting with the most important meal of the day — is the city’s answer to Elan Cafe; a pink paradise just off of the city’s landmark “Royal Mile”, Laila’s. It is a brunch-y Middle Eastern fusion joint with proven classics like French Toast, and Levantine faves like shakshuka.
Edinburgh is a foodie’s paradise so a walk in between meals is a must, and there’s nowhere better than the Royal Mile, which runs between Edinburgh Castle & another notable historical site; Holyrood House. Just to be transparent, the distance isn’t exactly 1 mile but you’ll find plenty of cute jaunts along this stretch, selling traditional Scottish exports; cashmere, wool, whiskey, shortbread & tablet. My favourite is an all-year-round Christmas shop guarded by 2 nutcrackers — a great place to buy an Edinburgh-themed souvenir. Everything in Edinburgh is fairly walkable but there are hills & cobbled streets to look out for on this side of town — so sky-high Louboutins? Not a good idea.
If all that walking has made you a bit peckish, you’ll find every cuisine you can fathom in Edinburgh. However I don’t think you can go wrong with Steak Frites, and you’ll find the best at Chez Jules — 2 courses will only set you back £9.90 [yes, you read that correctly]. It speaks to the kindness & hospitality that Scottish folks are known for. Upon your entry, you’ll be given a variation of hors d’oeuvres, as if you were visiting the house of an old friend — which is exactly what Edinburgh feels like.
Another [personal] favourite is Taco Libre, “owned by Mexicans, cooked by Mexicans” — the perfect opportunity to support a POC-owned business, and again very reasonably priced, as are many venues due to the large cohort of students occupying the city during term-time.
Edinburgh, unsurprisingly, is not short of places to wet your whistle. A firm favourite for an afternoon pick-me-up is a spot tucked inside the Edinburgh Grand hotel on St Andrew Square — The Register Club. The walls are clad in wooden panelling and play to the “old world” glamour Edinburgh is loved for. I am admittedly quite bougie, so this is exactly my cup of tea. If you’re looking for something a little more lively, a stone’s throw away is Rose Street Garden, an unassuming spot & one of my favourite places to take friends visiting from outside Scotland. From here, if you’re a shopaholic you can hop along to George Street or the new St James Quarter; a one-stop-shop for everything you’d need for a day (or few) in Edinburgh; accommodation, eateries, shopping, entertainment, bars — you name it.
A defining quality of Edinburgh is the stark contrast between the different areas of the city. “Old Town” with its cobbled streets & “New Town” as a sort of cosmopolitan Mecca. Bruntsfield is a little out of the way & more residential but just as trendy, and super underrated — though I’d recommend this for a weekend rather than just 24 hours, but granted, you’ll be back. As well as a trip to the shoreside town of Queensferry. A short journey will make you feel like you’re in San Francisco [though I can’t guarantee the weather will match up] and it’s super easy to reach. Get on a 43 bus from outside the train station and keep your camera at the ready because you are not prepared for the sites on the journey.
Where Edinburgh doesn’t match up to certain qualities of other capital cities, it excels in others. The weather [usually] lacks, but the people here beam brighter than the sun. Perhaps I’m just a proud Scot, or maybe there’s something in the air. I suppose you won’t know until you see it for yourself.
Check out the full list of recommendation at the 24 hours in Edinburgh placelist below!

We stayed in Edinburgh during the abnormally sunny month of June and we had the best time. Edinburgh has everything you could possible want in a city: gorgeous architecture, breath taking views, exquisite restaurants, cosy pubs, shops and boutiques galore and even a beach for good measure. It quickly made its way up my favourite list of cities, and I was super sad to be leaving.
Basically, Calton Hill > Princes St & George St loop >The Mound > Lawnmarket > Edinburgh Castle > Grassmarket > Greyfriar’s Bobby memorial > Cow Gate > Royal Mile. If you cover all over these places, you’re going to have a great day; great landmarks, awesome architecture, and plentiful cafes, bars, pubs and restaurants for a refreshment en route. We loved Grassmarket and it’s lively atmosphere. In summer, the restaurant tables overflow out on to the pedestrianised street area, and it’s a delight to see.
You’d never believe this beach was on the coast of Scotland. Although we were very lucky with the weather on one of the days, it’s equally as wonderful even when it’s a bit colder. It’s a large stretch of golden sand with rippling waves; there’s an adorable high street just beyond the promenade, both which are full of cafes and shops. Well worth a whole day out — we’d recommend The Velvet Easel Art Gallery on Portobello High Street, the art and jewellery in there was beautiful. We also stopped at Bross Bagel for a snack, another amazing find.
One of my favourite things to do in Edinburgh was to go a run around Arthur’s Seat and Holyrood park before work. While the way up can be quite painful while jogging (I walked a fair bit of it), the view and tranquility at the top is worth the effort. There’s a lake you pass at the top of the hill, and then you’ll reach the edge and be able to look over the whole coast. Once you reach the lake it’s either flat or downhill the whole way back, so at that point it’s plain sailing!
The views and features along this route rival any other; discover vast fields, woodlands, rivers and waterfalls, and breathtaking views across over to Cairngorns.
Dunkeld now has to be one of my new favourite towns. Not only is the high street to die for, but the pub on the river is one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever had a meal. The terrace has an outdoor bar, a large marquee, as well as copious amounts of seating, including picnic tables in and out of the marquee, sunny tables, and cute little bar stools and barrels by the river – something for everyone; you can read more about this pub/hotel in our other Edinburgh blog!
We decided to try and do a run walk to explore the water of leith. It follows the river from Leith right through the centre of Edinburgh. We discovered parts of Edinburgh that we never would have including Stockbridge (which had an open air food market called the Neighbourgood market) and also somewhere called Dean Village. Although there’s not much to do at Dean Village, the village sit upon the stream and its houses are stunning, a really tranquil place to walk through and I feel so grateful I got to explore it.
We loved exploring the views across Loch Katrine – but it would have been even better had we cycled round! There’s a wide paved path following the whole Loch round – And there’s even a bike hire centre at the car park!
Having said that it’s only because we scaled the hillside that we were able to get these amazing views, not quite so achievable on a bike!
While we didn’t actually visit Edinburgh Castle itself, we explored the surrounding area. It’s located at the end of the high street, and the closer you get to it, the prettier everything becomes. It’s also a stone’s throw from Grassmarket, a wide street made for pedestrians and pubs, filled with cafes, restaurants, pubs, shops and bars. Would fully recommend an afternoon of exploring that area, taking in the atmosphere and treating yourself to a pint and a view or two.
For a date night to remember, we recommend booking a night at the zoo. It’s an adult’s only event at Edinburgh Zoo, where you can wander round a kid-free zoo, grab a drink and a bite to eat from the couple of food stands, and even watch a bit of live music. It’s just an event they do during the summer of course. It’s well worth it! A lovely, chill atmosphere.
It’s got to be one of the most incredible things about Edinburgh, the fact that there’s a tremendously tall hill smack bang in the middle of it all. Although it’s quite a feat to climb, it’s well worth it. The views across Edinburgh in one direction and the bay in the other are spectacular.
Another breathtaking bit of greenery in the city, quite literally. Calton Hill is yet another steep trek, but again the views and the architecture are worth the effort.
One of our highlights of our time here was an Airbnb experience run by Julie — a sheep herder and her pack of dogs.
The experience began just driving there. We stopped in a beautiful hill side cafe and then carried on the drive through the most incredible valleys and glens.
When we arrived Julie warmly welcomed us, we met some sheep, and she then proceeded to exhibit her pack of working dogs — in all the various stages of training. Starting with the least experienced to the most, and then a finalé of two dogs working together.
All of her work in training is anything but tyrannical or dictatorship. Instead, she practices something she calls the ‘natural way’.
Hope to see you again really soon, Edinburgh!

The moment we entered our rental flat Roshan began exploring the whole place, and he was enthralled.
“Daddy let’s stay here and don’t want to go back to London,” he said.
All three of us exchanged looks in surprise. Was this the same kid crying non-stop about thirty minutes ago?
“Yes, this is our house until we leave this city,” said his father, holding him back from his excitement of running from room to room.
We had bought some eating stuff from Southport Morrison hoping that we may not get anything at night when we arrived in a new country. But we were wrong. Even in the night we were able to get some basics like milk, bread, butter, cheese, and some other crispy stuff for eating from a shop, very close to our stay.
After some light dinner we decided to sleep soon so that we would be refreshed in the morning to start our tour. As soon as I touched the bed, I dropped off to sleep and enjoyed a deep and peaceful sleep. I was up early in the morning.
Raindrops like slug trails trickled down the windowpane. Steely clouds hung low, heavy with more rain, smothering the town.

Edinburgh. It was a decades-long dream for this American to be there. And there I was, about halfway between Edinburgh Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse on the Royal Mile.
Alone.
The friend I was traveling with and I had just parted ways for the afternoon. She had other interests. I had to see Holyroodhouse, having read every fictional and nonfictional account of Mary, Queen of Scots, I could find over the years. Having watched every movie or program I could find. Having a general interest in history and specific interests in the British Isles.
Holyroodhouse is special to me. Even before Mary, there had been the wedding of James IV and Margaret Tudor in the abbey while the palace was under construction. Later, James VI would live at Holyrood until he became King of England and took up residence in London. So much happened here.
In between, there would be burnings and cannon attacks and repairs. Holyroodhouse has seen some things.
And I was going to see Holyroodhouse.
Alone.
That turned out to be the best part. My visit to Holyroodhouse was the beginning of my discovery of the joy of solo travel.
The Royal Mile is the road that slopes gradually from Edinburgh Castle at the top to Holyroodhouse at the bottom. It’s actually made up of several streets that run together west to east, starting with Castlehill, which runs into Lawnmarket, followed by High Street, on to Cannongate, and finally, Abbey Strand. It is roughly a mile long(an English mile) and takes just under a half hour to walk.
The Royal Mile is a busy thoroughfare, overrun by tourists and populated by colorful locals. Walking it alone gives you the opportunity to stop where you want and enjoy the view. If you’re walking and talking, you might miss some things . . ..
Like this guy playing his heart out for you although bagpipes are difficult to ignore!
This wizard floating in mid air.
This guy doing . . . his thing.
There’s always something to see on the Royal Mile, whether it’s the colorful characters or the rows of shops. So, so many shops.
But, finally, you end up here, at Holyroodhouse.
It was incredible to tour it alone, absorbed in my own thoughts. It was just me and Holyroodhouse. There were other tourists, but I hardly noticed them. I was having a moment with history, and that’s all I cared about.
Pictures aren’t allowed in Holyroodhouse, so I had to put away the potato I use for photography. (I suck at photography, and there’s no point in pretending otherwise, okay?)
Holyroodhouse is massive. You can tour parts of it online via the Royal Collection Trust. There is so much to see, from the state apartments (including the chambers of Mary, Queen of Scots) to the Throne Room and the Great Gallery. I stood at the spot where Mary’s secretary, David Rizzio, was murdered by her jealous husband, Lord Darnley, and his gang of assassins.
This spot, this murder, was the beginning of the end for Mary, Queen of Scots.
I stood there.
Outside, I was able to pull out my potato again and take some pictures of the ruins of the abbey that dates back to King David I of Scotland (1128, to be exact) and the grounds of the palace.
As I strolled the grounds (not the whole 10 acres, but some of it!), I wondered if Queen Mary had once walked where I was walking. Did she appreciate the lush beauty of the place?
Did she ever stand and admire this incredible view?
Finally, it was time to leave. My stomach was grumbling for fish and chips. (I gained five pounds on fish and chips in the UK and Ireland.)
The half hour walk back to the hotel would justify the fish and chips, so I decided to hoof it. I’m a avid walker anyway, so it seemed like a good chance to stretch the old legs, too.
There had been some instruction from our tour director about finding Princes Street if we got lost and following it and . . . more words. Who’s really listening when you’re trying to photograph Edinburgh Castle with a potato?
I set out in the direction of Princes Street. For some reason, my phone wasn’t getting any kind of connection, so I had no access to maps, and the paper one I had was kind of vague. Nevertheless, I set out confidently in the wrong direction.
Before this happened, I would have thought being lost would terrify me. I got lost in my car in the city I live in once when I was new to the area, and it was enough to keep me from going back until Google Maps became a thing. But then again, I did see a dead body on a stretcher and a swarm of cops arresting a bunch of people that day (the middle of a week day!), so there’s that.
But, I wasn’t scared in Edinburgh. Maybe it’s just Edinburgh, or maybe I’m older and wiser and more savvy now. I know what to look for and how to avoid a sketchy area, not that I saw any in Edinburgh. I’m sure they are there. As I strolled along, I realized I was relaxed and trusted myself. I was happy.
At one point, I spotted three people — two women and a young man — with a large map, so I approached them, hoping to get some directions. They stared at me nervously as I asked what street we were on. They spoke to each other — in German, I think — and looked, frankly, kind of terrified. (What were they saying? “It’s an American. Does it have a gun? What should we do?”) I tried to ask them if they knew the name of the street we were on, but I think they were even more lost than I was.
When I turned, I saw the ultimate “get unlost” solution: a tour bus driver! He was parked on a side street and vacuuming the steps of his vehicle with some little handheld thing. He cheerfully pointed me in the right direction, and off I went.
I think Edinburgh is still so vivid to me because I walked it alone, taking in every site, processing it all deliberately and thoughtfully. When there’s no extraneous chatter or other distractions, it’s easier to simply be in a place, be a part of it.
Upon finding Princes Street, I was still a bit turned around. I wanted to get some pictures of the Sir Walter Scott monument, and I knew I needed to go west. Waiting to cross a street, I asked a woman standing next to me if I was headed in the right direction. She responded that she thought so, and then said, “I’m so sorry, but I’m in a hurry, and I’m late,” before darting across the street and disappearing into the crowd.
“That’s fine. I’ll be fine,” I said because she did look distressed.
I continued on my way, still feeling happily lost and not minding at all now. If I wandered up and down Princes Street, I would eventually see the cross street that led to my hotel.
Then, I saw the woman, running back toward me, waving at me. Nearly out of breath, she pointed in the sky, “Do you see that spire ahead in the distance? Walk toward that. That’s the monument!” She turned to run off again, and I shouted “Thank you!” after her. She turned to wave, still trotting along, and I thought how kind it was of her to come back for me that way when she was in such a hurry.
And then I had my moment with Sir Walter Scott. I love Ivanhoe. His other books are good, too— the other Waverly novels — but Ivanhoe is special. I wrote about a book from my grad school studies , The Superhistorians, in another article. The author included Sir Walter Scott among his chosen great historians although books like Ivanhoe were historical fiction and Scott did take liberties with historical fact. But, he brought history to life and he did so by putting people at the center of it. He made history a riveting story.
As a history major who had been drawn to history initially through historical fiction, it meant something to me to stand before the monument to Scott and reflect on his work. It was yet another moment between Edinburgh and me.
Then it was time for fish and chips. And Guinness.
The main thing I learned from being lost on my own in Edinburgh was that it wasn’t a big deal. I have been interested in the idea of solo travel for awhile, and it seems to me there has been a explosion of interest in and information about it over the last couple of years. There are many articles online about why people are taking up solo travel, which typically include the freedom of being able to do what you want when you want with less expense, along with being able to immerse yourself fully in the experience. Solo travelers often note a boost to self confidence and self-knowledge that come with the experience. Solo travel can also be less stressful than traveling with others.
Would the imagery of the Royal Mile still be so vivid to me if I had walked it with another person? Would I have been as immersed in Holyroodhouse with someone else waiting for me to finish in a room or drawing my attention to something else? Would I have had that connection with a stranger that still reminds of how awesome human beings can be? Would I have enjoyed reflecting on the influence of Sir Walter Scott on me, a history and English major while standing before his statue?
Those memories are my own special memorie s— mine alone.
After Edinburgh, the idea of solo travel became more than just an idea to me. I now see it as something I can actually do.

Edinburgh. Known for its inspiring history, its eclectic catalogue of festivals and with it, an ever-present army of selfie-snapping tourists. (Can’t be helped, just comes with the territory, y’know.)
And whilst there are many wonderful attractions in Edinburgh, like any popular city, at times the main sights can become a little overcrowded, which isn’t ideal if you like your delights, day-tripper free.
Anyway, if this sounds a bit like you, then read on. We’ve been in touch with the locals who know this city best to put together the off the beaten track, things to see and do, places to eat, drink and generally watch the world go by.
(And to make things easy to follow, we’re going to be categorise each local tip with either EAT. DRINK. SEE. PLAY. Hopefully quite self-explanatory so we’ll get on with it…)
Dean Village (SEE. PLAY)What the locals say:
Ashley
IG: @ashleyWanders
“One of my favourite hidden gems in Edinburgh is the Water of Leith Walkway, a 20km riverside path that winds through the heart of the city. It’s a fantastic spot for a leisurely walk and a lovely natural oasis where you can go to escape the hustle and bustle (and it’s an absolute godsend if you need respite from the crowds during the Fringe Festival in August).”
What we say:
One of the most underrated scenic sites in Edinburgh. Although Dean Village is located about a 5–10 minute walk from the busy Princes Street. ‘Busy’ just doesn’t appear in Dean Village’s dictionary. What once was at the heart of Edinburgh’s manufacturing industry, the now quaint village is now a picturesque residential area, with old millstones, a temple and an ancient viaduct scattered throughout. If you follow your nose around the walkway, you’ll find the Dean Gallery and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, both free, both brilliant.
Bruntsfield (EAT. DRINK. PLAY)What the locals say:
Charlotte Ballantyne
IG: @justmuddlingthroughlife
“Edinburgh has plenty of suburbs to explore, each with their own atmosphere, to get away from the sometimes overwhelming city centre. Brunstsfield is full of local, independent shops, that’re away from the more common high street. Grab a coffee in Artisan Roast or The Chocolate Tree, browse for a new outfit in Biscuit Clothing or pick up some toys in Gulliver’s, then have a delicious meal in Three Birds or Montpellier’s!”
What we say:
Bruntsfield is a cultural hub, bursting at the seams with exciting things to see and do. The best part about it? Tourists often overlook it, which means you’ll get the chance to experience this suburb like a true local. As Charlotte mentions, there’s plenty of restaurants serving up the best local produce, there’s also no shortage of good pub grub and countless independent shops that’ll make your time in Bruntsfield a brilliant one. If you’re looking to stay out a little past your bedtime and the busy Grassmarket bars aren’t your cup of tea, there’s more than enough stylish, typically Scottish pubs and bars to wet your whistle.
The Stand Comedy Club (DRINK. PLAY)What the locals say:
Charlotte Ballantyne
IG: @justmuddlingthroughlife
“This tiny little underground venue is legendary in Edinburgh, having been the place where many world-famous comedians got their start. It’s open every night of the week, hosting both newcomers and better-established names — Monday nights are ‘Red Raw’, where any beginner can take part, with tickets priced at just £3. If you’re lucky, more famous comedians will often make a surprise appearance to test out new material, especially in the months leading up the Fringe in August!”
What we say:
Established in 1995 in the basement of an Edinburgh pub, the club has grown to become one of the UK’s best comedy venues and a mainstay of the Festival Fringe. The club is also no stranger to hosting famous acts, with the likes of Kevin Bridges and Frankie Boyle learning their trade at the venue and if you’re lucky, they sometimes pop back to practice new material. (You might also be happy to know the club has banned stag and hen parties, which mean most of the people you find there are indeed the locals and are there for a L plate free, good time.)
Stockbridge (EAT. DRINK. PLAY)What the locals say:
Iveta Zalcaite
IG: @ivetazalc
“My favourite part of the city was is Stockbridge, if you’re looking for a truly local experience; this area is packed with lots of independent shops and cute cafes. That definitely isn’t covered in tourists!”
Kieron Roulston
IG: @kieronroulston
“Stockbridge Market on a Sunday is an excellent opportunity to go exploring Edinburgh’s new town — don’t get a taxi, take a walk down from George Street via Circus Lane and take in the different character of Edinburgh’s Mews”
What we say:
Edinburgh is full of downright lovely places, but Stockbridge has to be up there as one of the loveliest. It’s stunning architecture, charming village-like atmosphere, and its abundance of local cafes and restaurants, make it popular with the Edinburgh locals. We could sit here and list the all of its main attractions, but we don’t want to be here ALL day, so our top 3 Stockbridge picks are: Inverleith Park, the Royal Botanic gardens and the Stockbridge market (Sunday only) at Jubilee garden. Do take Edinburgh local Kieron’s advice and take the time to walk down from George Street, he knows what he’s talking about.
Blackford Hill (PLAY)What the locals say:
Charlotte Ballatyne
IG:@justmuddlingthroughlife
“For stunning views of Edinburgh, skip the crowds on Arthur’s Seat and instead head to the south side of the city to climb Blackford Hill, where you’ll get incredible views of Edinburgh Castle, Holyrood Park, and all the way over the Firth of Forth on a clear day. You can take a direct route straight up and down if you’re short on time, or spend a little longer wandering through the Braid Woods nearby.”
What we say:
If there’s one thing Edinburgh is not short of its stunning views, both of and throughout the city. But a lot of the time, stunning views comes with a stunning amount of selfie sticks carrying. This is particularly true of Arthur’s Seat, which does have a fantastic view of the capital, but can get a little crowded. If you take Charlotte’s advice here and head up to Blackford Hill you’ll get amazing views and decent snaps, minus the crowds. Lovely.
Books! (PLAY)What the locals say:
Nathan Young
IG: @nathanyoung2202
“Edinburgh is home to some amazing antique bookstores; the first one to pay a visit to is Armchair books in West Port. Deceiving on first looks, once inside, it’s an Aladdin’s cave of assorted paraphernalia, soft toys and hand-written notes. If you’re looking for first editions of certain books, it’s highly likely you’ll find what you’re looking for, they offer Victorian and second hand books for most genres.
Next on the list is Old Town Bookshop, Victoria Street. This is a bookworm’s dream — with editions dating back to the 1600s and a variety of genres as well as maps and art for pickings. Summerhall bookshop features an array of varied exhibitions and events hosted there. It also has a small gallery and a café inside where you can purchase a Scottish Breakfast roll to kick off your day.”
What we say:
To be honest we couldn’t put Nathan’s description better ourselves. Edinburgh is scattered with many independent bookshops, a lot of them teeming with more than just the books. The pick of the stores would have to be Armchair books; it’s cluttered, it’s messy and its disorganised, but this makes it the best place to browse. Whether it’s fiction or nonfiction, it really doesn’t matter, there’s enough to browse that you could probably spend your whole time in the city exploring the shelves, searching for that hidden gem you didn’t know you wanted.
Dr Neil’s Garden (PLAY)What the locals say:
Sally Cholewa
IG: @choggzy
“Tucked away in Duddingston, just outside the city centre, this established botanical garden is full of twisting and winding paths lined with beautiful plants. It makes for a wonderfully secluded and quiet spot. There are often community events happening including traditional Scottish storytelling. The ‘secret’ garden even has its own curling museum as Duddingston loch is where the first official rules were established.”
What we say:
Otherwise known as Edinburgh’s secret garden, these gardens are THAT secret that a lot of the locals would struggle to point you in their direction. This stunning area is the handy work of Dr Andrew and Nancy Neil, built at the foot of Arthur’s Seat in the 60s. They’re more than just beautiful wildlife and winding paths to the locals; this serene spot is a place of inspiration, meditation and contemplation. The perfect place to plonk yourself and unwind.
Whisky, Gin & Beer (DRINK)What the locals say:
Charlotte Ballantyne
IG: @justmuddlingthroughlife
“Scotland is famous for its whisky, and there are plenty of options to sample it in Edinburgh — try a tasting in Whiski Rooms on North Bank Street, Bow Bar on Victoria Street, or Usquabae on Hope Street. There’s plenty of other alcohols produced in this country too though — take a tour of the Edinburgh Gin Distillery in the West End, or Pickering’s Gin in Summerhall. Or if you’re a craft beer fan, try Red Squirrel on Lothian Road, or St Andrews Brewing Co. on Potterrow. Edinburgh is a very international city; so expect to rub elbows with locals, expats, and a few visitors alike in most of the city’s pubs and bars!”
What we say:
Apart from bagpipes, haggis, or going one better with a deep-fried Mars bar (yes, they do exist). If there’s one thing you’re going to do in Edinburgh, it’s try some traditional Scotch whiskey, or equally, if whiskey isn’t your preferred weapon of choice, you might want a tipple of some sort. Like any city nowadays, Edinburgh has a plethora of bars and pubs to choose from. But where do you go for something different, yet traditional, that’s not heaving with tourists? You can’t argue with Charlotte’s recommendations, and here’s some more of our favourite Edinburgh drinkeries…
Jupiter Artland (SEE)What the locals say:
Charlotte Ballantyne
IG: @justmuddlingthroughlife
“Located a half hour bus ride from the city centre, and only open during the summer months, Jupiter Artland is hidden surprise for art lovers. The grounds of this old manor house have been transformed into something like an adult playground, full of modern art installations specifically designed for the park, incorporated into the landscape, which encourage you to explore and interpret as you please.”
What we say:
Most people look after their garden with a bit of mowing and the odd hedge trim every now and again. But when Robert and Nicky Wilson moved into Bonnington House, a Jacobean manor with a 100-acre estate, they decided to do a hell of a lot more. Transforming their land into a contemporary art park and gallery, showcasing work by leading sculpture and land artists.
When exploring this spectacular garden and grounds, you’ll find cutting edge sculptures and installations from the world’s best, who are given complete freedom to produce whatever they like. And due to the sheer size of the estate, escaping the crowds isn’t something that even needs to enter your mind. Like, ever. Enjoy.

Before coming to the United Kingdom, as an Asian girl, the most common cities that have been heard of were London, Manchester, and Edinburgh. However, unlike the previous two cities, Edinburgh is the city I got highly recommended many times as it will give a different impression of a United Kingdom city from London and Manchester.
This recommendation made me put it on the top of the travel list to visit instantly once I have time. When I finally know there is a chance to travel to Edinburgh, I look forward to this trip and find out why this city can earn that acclamation from people there before.
Once I stepped out of the train station, I instantly noticed why this city left such a fantastic feeling for visitors. But, of course, the first reaction that came to my mind was, ‘Am I in the United Kingdom?’.
Scotland’s capital city, unlike London or Manchester, emphasizes constructing a modern financial centre for people. The urban planning of Edinburgh has shown both the historical and contemporary image to tell its story to people who first visit this city.

Our Moscow guide Dasha traveled to the UK on New Year holidays, and here are her impressions about Edinburgh.
I fell in love with Edinburgh — the place where castles and gardens compete with whisky and beer — and actually it impressed me even more than London.
Nothing can be compared to this atmosphere of medieval times, amazing grey buildings, peaceful local life and true Scottish spirit.
This is where peace and history go to relax, and you should too. Or write a sequel to Harry Potter. Joanne Rowling won’t mind as long as you’re happy.
Set the tone for this historical adventure by plunging into the history of Edinburgh and exploring its gems. Let the story begin with… 20 fun facts about Edinburgh.
1. Edinburghers have called this area home since 7th century AD. See if you like what they’ve done to the city that is sometimes called the Athens of the North” and decide for yourself if you agree with Robert Louis Stevenson that “Edinburgh is what Paris ought to be”.
2. The massive and gorgeous Edinburgh castle is built on an extinct volcano. The last time the volcano erupted was 350 million years ago.
3. The volcano`s crater got the name “Arthur`s Throne”.
4. From the ancient times the Edinburgh castle has an unofficial name — The Key from the Country.
5. The first people on Castle Rock appeared there about 1000 years BC.
6. Edinburgh was the first city in the world to have its own fire service in 1703. But it was a volunteer fire brigade, that`s why it took a lot of time to gather people and come to the burning place before it`s too late.
7. Edinburgh is the greenest city in the UK, since there are 112 parks in the city.
8. The first king of Great Britain James I (a Scottish king James VI) was born in the Edinburgh castle.
9. The city has a nickname — Auld Reekie (Old Smoky) which was given to the city in connection with an era when a lot of coal and wood were burnt for heating and the air was full of smoke.
10. The Stone of Destiny which is kept in the Edinburgh castle is still used for the crowning of English Monarchs.
11. J.K.Rowling used to go to the Nicolson`s café during a hard period of her life and she started to write the first book about Harry Potter exactly there. Now there is a restaurant on that place called «Spoon».
12. One more literature fact — Ebenezer Scrooge from the famous novel by Charles Dickens «A Christmas Carol» was also born in Edinburgh when the author misread the tombstone of a real person with the same name. He read «Meanman» instead of «Mealman», which means «corn trader».
13. Actually people started producing whisky not in Scotland, but in Ireland in 5th century. However, there are over 100 whisky distillers in Scotland. Well played!
14. The unicorn is a national animal of Scotland, while thistle and heather are floral emblems.
15. The number of heritage buildings in Edinburgh is bigger than anywhere. There are about 16 thousands historical buildings of different epochs.
16. Edinburgh is also standing on seven hills like Rome and Moscow.
17. About 13 million tourists visit Edinburgh every year.
18. Edinburgh is an art city. Every year in August the world best concert and theater troupes come here for the Summer Art Festival. Edinburgh is the world’s number one festival destination.
19. The Princess Street Gardens is a sneaky way to move from Old Times to New Era, as the gardens break the city into two parts.
20. Royal Mile is the most famous street in the city, it was the favorite street for walk for Scottish and English monarchs.

On the way we decided to pick up some eatables for us and two more pairs of socks for me from Morrison supermarket. Since it was Christmas time the supermarket was crowded with shoppers.
Hardly an hour was spent there and despite the drizzling rain, we resumed our journey to Edinburgh.
Observing the breathtaking sceneries on both sides, and chit chatting, we passed through some beautiful places like Preston, a town in Lancashire the northwest of England on the bank of River Ribble, in Lake District.
Every object in the journey was new and interesting to all of us. Our journey continued till we took a break in Westmorland, a motorway service station, off the M6 motorway. It is a popular exit station for the travellers.
We had our food and indulged in some shopping. The items available there were all organic straight from the farms. The other items like milk, cheese etc were also from the sheep reared by the farmers. One farmer had started this shop and the food cooked by his wife became favourite of the travellers…

Hi there! Maeghan & Oli here - we're taking a break to travel the world and hope you'll join us for the ride. 🌏✈️ 👫 www.alittledetour.ca

After Oli’s full recovery from food poisoning, we made our way to Scotland!
Back in July we toured Norway together with our friend Theresa, who flew in from Calgary. We traveled well as a group and kept bugging her to join us again on our little detour and we managed to convince her to join us for our final leg in Scotland!
We met up in Glasgow for just one night (Halloween!) and then made our way Edinburgh for some hiking, exploring and history. There was a lot to see and not enough time… Within the first 48 hours, we all agreed: this is a place we will come back and visit.
Here are our first few days together!
See more on our website www.alittledetour.ca🌏✈️👫
We left Glasgow and made our way to Edinburgh. The city is super cool and the medieval influence is very visible the moment you drive into the city limits.
We got to our Airbnb which was the biggest apartment Oli and I have stayed in during our entire year long travel! We had a beautiful view of the city, the university and the beautiful fall colours.
“Although the origin of the name is uncertain, some claim that there is a connection between Edinburgh and King Arthur. Arthur’s Seat may have been the location of legendary Camelot.” — — Earth Trekkers!
There are these areas of the old town that they call “Close” and it is essentially a square or alley that connects all the houses. They would use them to sell things — like the Fish Close, was for the fisherman to sell fish. Our tour guide told us to try and explore as many as possible.
So Theresa picked one.. and we followed her down it, but it turned out to be a rocky hallway that pigeons lived in, there was poop everywhere and they chased Maeghan right out.
We also learned about where the saying “shit face” came from. The wealthy people of Edinburgh would live on the ground level floors of the tall beautiful buildings because the top floors were a fire hazard— so locals would pay more for lower-level apartments, for safety.
But since toilets were not a thing yet… they used chamber pots and would simply yell out the window as the person was dumping them out.
Since this caused much chaos, the city put in a new rule: you can only empty your chamberpots at 7 in the morning, and 10 at night.
Problem is, 10 at night is when the pubs would close. So combine drunk people pouring out onto the streets with people pouring chamberpots out of their windows, and you can picture how you might come home after a night of drinking: shit-faced drunk.
On our last night we caught up with an old friend of Maeghan’s from Calgary. Anton homeschooled with Maeghan and we had the chance to discuss politics, homeschooling, the weather and our exotic spouses. ☺️

Scotland’s capital is one classy city. Edinburgh boasts quaint cobbled streets, many hidden hide-outs, excellent shopping, eerie dungeons and a big boss of a castle that rivals even Hogwarts. No wonder it’s famous for putting on a heck of a festival every year. Even better than that, it lasts the whole month of August, and jam-packs in so many diverse acts that the festival programme is published as thick as the phone book. The Edinburgh International Festival is the world’s largest arts festival and it’s no surprise that it attracts acts and tourists from every continent, as well as the locals, in droves. This is a city which takes great pride in its culture, where the best of the best hope to make a name during the festivities.
So don your finest kilt if you have one, embrace (don’t slate) the sounds of bagpipes, and drink Tennents until you are fully wearing your beer goggles. It’s going be one heck of a month.

This 21 mile walk from the Scottish Capital to the centre of Dunfermline is a pilgrimage of my own making. It didn’t aim for any church or holy site; instead I aimed to go see my Uncle’s artwork being exhibited in the centre of Dunfermline. Ever one to make something harder than it should be in the search for growth, I planned out how I could walk from my front door to his paintings. A week before the route was being tweaked and twiddled with, down to where I can stop for an emergency piss if the need arose. Turns out, not many people walk from the centre of Edinburgh, across the Forth and onto Dunfermline. The only snippets of adventures I could find dipped in and out of my route; but none of them were complete. Perfect, an adventure is to be had.
I am not religious, nor have I ever been, yet through walking and adventuring I have found a sense of mindfulness. A spiritual freedom you may call it. At around 10 miles I experience a deep sense of joy and zen. Runners have told me they experience something similar, but I have yet to find that point running; instead I feel every excruciating second of the bloody thing. Yet, via walking I zone into a different world, one of my own making. At mile 15 I usually land hard like a Ryanair aeroplane before bouncing up back into my mindfulness. For this walk, though, I would hit mile 20. What then would that bring me?
It’s 6:30 am and my HipHop mix alarm is sudden and loud. ‘Damn it feels good to be a Gangsta’. True, maybe. Today I’m hoping it feels good to be a Pilgrim; whatever that is. January is in full flow, but storms have passed and there’s clear cool air in the city. Not many are trundling about as I leave, espresso heavy on my stomach, at around 7:30 am. Deliveries clatter and clang into Sainsbury’s, high vis workers smash down the lorry’s back doors and floors. It cuts the crisp morning air. I begin to look forward to the promised remoteness of much of my trek. Before long I am passing a quiet Haymarket Station; it is the weekend, no commuters are jousting up and down the road today. Air is blue, the moon is full and bright against the wisps of clouds. Their fast movement across its face does not bode well for the wind later on.
Edinburgh has a fair amount of old railway lines that have been tarmaced over and converted into sheltered paths. The one I spring onto is a familiar one for me; during lockdown I would glide down here to the beach, filled with regret when I get there that I didn’t pack more warm clothes. Even in the height of summer Cramond is a windy bitch. A jogger huffs past and a cyclist dressed all in black whizzes past. My espresso gurgles and shifts; what was my toiletry plan again? I stare down at my phone like a lost tourist coming out of Waverly. A Tesco is marked at the very end of my railway route and before I dive between two golf courses. My breakfast stop. Tree’s sway and lurch in the wind as the dark blue sky turns to pink, then a light gold. The sun is on its way behind me as a veer off from my Northern path to the West.
A Tesco employee stares at my walking stick in a bit of a stunned silence as I ask about toilets. Seconds pass before he forces out a ‘No’. Not quite the spiritual guidance I was looking for on my Pilgrimage, I admit. But perhaps this area doesn’t get many wanderers this early on a Saturday. I dart off and onto a well-to-do road. Cameras, locked gates and larger financed cars come and go as I wander through. The houses get larger and more elaborate, the gates get more defensive and taller. This road is very clean, I will say. Although there seems to be no sign of life I can’t help feel eyes on me. Perhaps a Pilgrimage is a trial of sorts. This is my first one today; do not shit yourself in a posh neighbourhood. It would be caught on multiple cameras and posted online as a VR experience before I reach the Forth Road Bridge.
The road comes to an abrupt end, turning into a path which seems meagre and slim compared to the vastness of the properties behind me. I’m now sandwiched between two golf course, various signs tell me not to litter or even contemplate becoming a member; they can tell I’m not quite up to scratch by the stick I’m swaying about. A dog walker, the first of the day, looks tired and fed up. He looks up under his hat but his eyes are sunken, sad. Is it golf that has made him like this? Or the weight of owning a castle? Or perhaps he doesn’t belong here, like me, but comes to envy and depressed about the life some lead. Either way we slink past each over on this wee pathway. More big houses flank me as I pop out onto a new street, these are chopped up into flats, though. Suddenly I dive down a windy old road and into some trees. At the bottom of this glen like snake I come across a small field of ponies. It is cold and damp down here, the houses look sodden. Then, just as I’m getting the heebie jeebies I turn sharply onto a stone bridge that spans a smooth, icy cold river. I stop for breakfast.
Before me the river is escorted into the distance by forestry and steep green banks. Tops of the trees are on fire from the ever so slowly rising sun. A golden morning stabs across the landscape, splicing my view into harsh warms and glassy colds. A dog comes to inspect my backpack and the fallen crusty crumbs of my pork pie. Their walker takes no heed of me. A few minutes pass watching the silk like water flow away from me and I head off up and out of the crossing. On my left a helter skelter of a building seems to have been slapped together in a rustled puzzle box. Is it a community centre? A church? I place a bet with myself and lose it all immediately. It’s a steak restaurant; I have driven past it numerous times on the way to the bridges. It brings a nice pang of realisation how far I have to go yet, seen as though the road takes a while and goes almost directly to them. I, though, must turn hard right towards the shore. North once more, away from the city and into the Dalmeny Estate.
A large muddy puddle welcomes me into the estate via a metal gate. I spend a few seconds staring it down. I’m mile 7 into my walk. If I get my feet wet now then the next 15 will be less than ideal. I jump it and slip with my walking stick. Luckily I’m alone and swan off up the long, straight road. To my right now there is a line of soldier like trees being pierced with brilliant gold. Their shadows barcode the road before me as it stretches off into a wide left leaning corner. My left is all ploughed farm fields, topped with bushes and trees as they slope uphill. I stop to take some photos for my own personal stash of farm related memories. A country lad at heart. Snowdrops welcome me at the various twists and turns of my golden road and before long the landscape opens up wide into rolling fields. A deep warm stench of hay and manure catches the wind here and there and now I begin to see some new faces.
“Morning!” A deep, booming voice bellows at me as a runner flies past. It startles me as I’m now zoning out into my zen-like world of farm equipment and muddy trails. “You alright!” I shout back. An exhausted “Aye.” Floats back to me. A few more people, dog walkers, general walkers and runners go past and each say good morning, how are you doing, beautiful day for it. It’s a social extravaganza here in the estate. My flurry of networking peters out and I slope down into more forestry. Thin, tall pines guard the shoreline that I can see spanning the view between their dark barks. The sun has yet to reach down here. A quietness settles around me, shells appear in the muddy path. I see a small opening onto the beach and jump driftwood onto the pebbly, sandy shore. It’s wonderful. Expansive and calm with the tide out, the sea is a far off foe I will conquer later in the day. For now it offers a definitive end to my Northern direction. Cramond Beach to my right is busy with people, but they are distant and seem to be across a dreamlike void. Cramond Island sits amongst the warm light of the morning, ships moving slowly behind it; their bright red hulls a stark brush stroke on an otherwise fair, cold view. I sit on the driftwood and stretch my legs. Silence. A swish of leaves above me as a gust of wind hits. Nothing. A leaf rustles onto my trainers. I cry, just a little.
On my walks I often cry, or get to a point that holds me to a tear or two. Sometimes it’s the silence, the calm. Or sometimes it’s a memory spurred from what I’m seeing, what I’m thinking or what I’m hearing. This Pilrimage has a density heavier than most due to death itself, which hit my family from all sides in all ways in 2021. For reasons I’m yet to really figure out myself, I have never posted about it on socials, or anywhere, really. A percieved lack of permission from who knows who, or a unwillingness to put any of it to solidified, permenant digital ink? I do not know, but I will say, on this walk I carried everyone with me, every step.
I’m just about to hit mile 8 and this is where my first tear drops of the day. But what a view for it to happen to. I spend longer than I probably should watching the world, not really do much. Voices behind me in the woodland break my train of thought. Runners coming up through the path I’m yet to tread. I look left expecting, foolishly, to see the red arches of the rail bridge spanning the water. Nothing in sight. I have a long way to go. Fife taunts me slightly as I dive back into the woods, it knows I’m coming for it. But it also knows how many trials I have to face on my wee Pilgrimage.
Shortly I see a bright square of stone drawn onto the curving coastline through the woods. Above it is a bright blue sky with textured clouds. The sun hits it hard, bright. A castle of light stone sits proudly upon the sandy waters of the Forth. But it is a way away yet. I trundle on through beautiful woodland, red trunks vear up to swaying canopies. Sometimes the sun strikes in and searches out the shining shells and sand that pop up here and there. Now and again a fallen tree crosses my path. Some old and mossy, some new and yet to be traversed properly. I cross a rolling stream of turquoise as it tumbles down into the grassy banks of the beach. It guides me along its shore before it spits me out onto another expansive view of the beach. This time there are less pebbles and more shimmering sand. My guide curves its way down to the sea through the banks. Following it with my eyes it leads me to the castle, now much closer. Mile 8 done. There’s an Eminem joke in there somewhere.
Green grass mixes with yellow sand like a paint palette. I pick up speed. My surroundings have me excited with this adventure. Castles, beaches, forests and farms. Dalmeny House solidifies my enjoyment as it pops up, looming proudly on my left. Vibrant, flat green grass rolls right up to its walls. It is a set piece, a view with a view and it stops me in my tracks. But the magic falters. Seemingly it is being renovated, or gutted. Ugly metal fences hug it horribly and metal work pokes out here and there. Windows boarded, taped. A pile of shite on it’s flanks. No matter, I have the castle I have been walking towards for the last few miles. My bright stone castle on the water. Once I get to it the magic falters again. No Entry. Fair enough. But, it too is boarded up, closed off, hiding. Recent work is obvious, but it is a shy place. Seaward it stands out and proud, but us landlubbers can only catch glimpses as it peers through shrubbery and trees. Perhaps I need some energy or water because my mood takes a bit of a dip. The next two miles are a slog, they are cold and my golden sun disappears for a long while. Where the hell are the bridges?
Maybe that was one of my trials of my Pilgrimage, a featureless forest that seems to never end. More likely it is my need to have a little rest and some food. Luckily the red metal work of the Rail Bridge begins to appear between the leaves. Then I find an opening and stumble down a muddy bank to a bunch of rocks. Perfectly there is a large fallen tree that acts as a seat. I sit, eat and admire the view. The Forth Rail Bridge spans across the water right before me. South Queensferry nestles underneath all three of the bridges to my left; my next destination before crossing the middle bridge. The wind is scathingly cold here. Boats bob about, waves lap hectically. I scoff my face and stretch my legs. My uncle messages me, “Where about are you?” I send a photo of the bridge back. Next up, South Queensferry.
Before I get into the meat of the town a woman walks out from her car in front of me and stops dead for seemingly no reason. I check my stride and go to pass her but she absent mindedly wanders to the side I’m going around. It is no big thing, but after marching for 11 miles now it was a strange feeling to me, stopped dead by a person not paying attention to anything. I leave her in my dust and enter a quiet town. Behind me the Forth Rail Bridge stands tall. Walking beneath it is nothing compared to taking a step back and viewing it. I always remember seeing it when I was younger on the TV and it seemed mystical to me. When I first moved up to Scotland it was the one thing I was desperate to see. Now, walking underneath it and having it as part of my adventure I felt a sense of connection to it. To bring myself back down to earth I finally found a toilet in South Queensferry and made sure I left my mark for any following Pilgrims. A miracle occurred there.
Soon enough I was dodging folk on pavements as I stormed up the hill towards the beginning of the bridge I was to cross. Once I got underneath it I felt a sting of excitement about what I was about to do. It’s cold, dark concrete consumed me as I looped up to the road from the town. Stopping briefly to adjust my backpack and jacket, I set out to go across. Then it hit me. A fear so deep, so bubbly and heavy that I almost fell to the floor. It wraithed inside of my stomach and my eyes became like a small tunnel. I staunchly marched forward as fast as I could, but once I’d reached the water the fear consumed me. Tiny gaps every 10 ft or so let me see the waters far below. Every coach that stormed past me bounced the large metalworks that struck up high and mighty above me. Wind blew and gust in a menacingly horrible way; it seemed determined to shove me over the edge. This was not enjoyable. I had hoped to grab some good photos of the Rail Bridge I adored so much whilst on here, but now… Get me off here! Metal creaked. The floor bounced. The wind blew. A cyclist went past and was nearly blown into me. Madman. At one point I swept past a porta-loo; what a way to go, blown into the Forth by a cubicle of shite. I could not get across to the otherside quick enough. But, had I known what I was about to tackle I may well have just stayed on the bridge.
It’s hot in the sun now. Face warm from the wind and no doubt the nerves I settled down on the steps that climb from the bridge to a road. Everything on this side of the Forth seems quiet and empty. No cars, nor people, mill about or make any sound. I take a moment. Now I convince myself that my Pilgrimage does indeed have trials, and the bridge was the biggest one by far. Never again! I proceed underneath its shadowy archways after a few more bites to eat. The road I’m on heads up and over a small hill before it dips suddenly down to swoop under the large motorway. In amongst the swirling, busy roads sits a boarded up house. It’s wee, messy and depressing. Concrete hugs the landscape and even in the yellow light of the day it is cold. This has become quite a tour of infrastructure, if that is the type of thing you’re into. I video call my wife.
Not as impressed by my feat of terror crossing the bridge as I thought she would be, she asks what my onward route is. Docks, Rosyth and forests, I reply. The sun is beating down now and I’m exposed to its warmth and the cold wind as I plod along. Down below me I see a grandfather and his granddaughter, fitted out with wellies, traversing a wind swept nature reserve. At least, these are the facts I project down upon the scene. Reeds and grass ebb and flow in the eager gusts. They shelter but chat enthusiastically. I stand for a while as they bounce away into the hazy grasses; tall bridges loom above them off into the choppy waters. I turn and continue along the most tedious road I’ve ever walked up.
Large metal buildings at the docks creak and boom as machinery, cranes, buildings get closer and more imposing. On the other side of the road there’s just shite. Sewerage works, quarries, a large car park where a bored looking guy in a JCB backhoe moves around asphalt. Usually I love a big of heavy machinery action, but I just want to get out of this tundrum place. It takes longer, it seems, than my whole walk completed beforehand to reach the pathway I need to dart up to get away. A pigeon coop castle stops me in my tracks, but the litter strewn path forces me to move on swiftly. My walks are all about moods and mindfulness; I find it difficult to reach those heady heights when bags of dog shit wave at me as I pass them as if I’m some kind of royal shitter.
The mood does not improve as I’m spat out into a disused industrial park. Large blue offices with smashed windows and fenced off to the nines greet me. Two lads saunter in front of me, neither see me until I whizz past them. “Eh!” One of them exclaims. Who knows what stories they have to hand to fling out at the drop of a hat. But I have wasted time watching families explore nature reserves and need to speed through my next section. I turn out of this and onto a roundabout. The housing estate across from me, and which I now need to navigate, is a familiar one to me. In my hometown you are looked down upon if you live on the wrong side of the river. And those that do look down upon those who live on the wrong side of the river, but also the wrong side of the railway. I won’t say which my current view stands in this chart of a made up class system. But, I look up to the right to a bus stop I need to pass and see a group of young lads, hand down their trousers and on their wee willy winkies and I decide to just head the opposite direction. If the Tesco employee was suspicious of my walking stick, or staff, wand? Then these chaps will want to make a few awkward inquiries; always trust your gut.
Pleasantly surprised by the streets and back alleys I wind down, I make my way quickly though Rosyth. I came across many cats but no people, until I reach the local football ground. It’s rugged and harshly laid out and windswept, much like everything else this side of the Forth it so far. A game is on and it has drawn quite a crowd. Shouts, punts of a football and conversation echo around the fields. I pass unnoticed as two posties discuss the ins and outs of the club. Before disappearing around a corner of wild bushes I witness the worst throw-in I’ve ever seen. But the managers shout enthusiasm, which is humbling and just all round nice, really. I spot a box of a school across the flat fields. More importantly I get my first view of Dunfermline. “I’m coming for you!” I point with my stick. Before long I’m turned onto a busy, loud road. Cars speed past kicking up dust, cups and I spot a perfectly new boot on the side of the road. How did it get here? Distantly I see a line of trees leading up a hill. My next stop to aim for; a cemetery.
What seemed like a mile or two later I cross in a rare gap of speedy cars and vans and onto a country lane. Straight as an arrow it heads to the cemetery where I pause briefly before heading into. I scan around; it is both old and new, both forgotten and intensely remembered. My road strikes right through it and around left, but the loop also goes right and back to where I’m standing. Lines and lines of graves fall into formation up the hill, around the loops and over through some trees. Some are old, almost green but many are shiny, bright, shaped intricately. There are plenty of flowers, more than I have ever seen in a cemetery. A freshly dug pile of dirt faces me directly straight on through the middle; orange in the glaring sun through the bare branches. I head right, along a long row of varying scales of gravestones to a bench. Thanking the folk on the plaque I sit and re-sock, eat and drink. I am alone only a few minutes before a blue car creeps into the cemetery, up the middle and begins to loop towards me. It stops. A woman of vibrant red lipstick and matching jacket steps out. She does not look around. Red roses are grasped firmly in her hands and she heads quickly to a grave. Roses planted, she says something. I look in my bag for some more food, I do not want to encroach upon such a moment. When I look up she is driving past me, eyes fixed ahead. She’s gone.
Part of me wanted to go see who she had just visited. Ultimately I decided against it and let the place drift in my mind. A beautifully colourful windmill danced in the middle of the rows. Around it some stones had faded flowers, some fresh, some well trodden, some slightly overgrown. I wonder, for the faded ones, what was the very last time they were visited. Why did the visits stop? Are they forgotten or are they remembered elsewhere? The cleaner ones make me weep; grief is all still too near for me. If I cry at an empty beach what hope do I have here? A van chugs into the entrance and stops, a bunch of guys jump out and begin to offload flowers; watering them in a very old tap that sits right near the gate. Another two cars enter to navigate the back end of the cemetery. I take it as a cue to leave, I have no purpose here.
Up upon the hill the cemetery swoops down from where I see the wartime graveyard, clean, green and precise in its purpose. Their white stone shines even in the shadows of the canopy above. My path turns muddy, leafy. Farms and fields replace roads and graves. This scenery is where I feel most at home. Dug out pathways, faded metal gates, long grasses and upturned troughs. Calmness descends over me and I stand for a while on a particularly exposed, high field and close my eyes to take in the sounds. Birds, wind, a distant gunshot. I move on.
Through a forest I pass silently in thought. A very recent fallen tree breaks my path in two; it has also stripped another tree of all its branches as it fell. Quite a sight to see, the sound must have been tremendous. Leaves crunch and slide as I navigate around it. I then bump into a runner with a bushy 80’s style moustache. He looks as surprised to see me rustling through the woods as I am of him. He hops one of the branches needlessly; it would have looked amazing in slow motion, I admit. Old walls of battered, mossy stones replace the leaves. They lead me to proper farmland, tractor markings and wide, open fields of various stages. Dodging puddles of depths unknown I march on towards a huddled collection of farmhouses and out buildings. A wee woman walking her dogs hurries past me; distrust in her eyes. A right angled turn left and I’m now facing North once more, and technically shouldn’t deviate from this direction until I meet my Uncle.
I am deep into mile 20 now. Dunfermline has been quite hidden down in the cemetery and winding farm pathways but now it taunts me openly. An adjustment of my backpack and a swig of water and I am set onto a thin line of a path on the edge of a busy road. It twists and turns before deciding to dive down into the town and before I know it I am encompassed by buildings and buses. It seemed like a click of a finger from farm to town, which is perhaps why this place is quite popular. My last trial is to find my way through the streets to where the gallery is; I immediately fail. Instead of heading right I take a wrong turn and find myself in a wee glen, complete with babbling brook. Another tree crosses my path, fallen fairly recently by the worn path being defined beneath it. I duck under and realise I now need to climb out of this quite beautiful place. How many trees have crossed my path today? 4? 5? I recount in my mind as I hustle up a zig zagging pathway. Onto solid ground and an uphill street leads me into the centre of town. I’m hot, sweaty and energy levels are in danger of plummeting right at the last. I head to Tesco and grab a Lucozade before my Uncle pops around the corner with a massive smile on his face.
Over a well earned pint we chat about all things worldly, both important and unimportant in life. Our food takes 5 working days to appear but I’m content. His artwork is awe inspiring, and a deep sense of pride grabs me as we view it and discuss it. There’s a deep, heavy therapy in the artwork that is echoed by the other pieces in the exhibit. Truly amazing to see. A few hours later I am dropped off at the station to head back on the next train that shows. As I whizz back along my 6 hour journey in 20 minutes I view my trials one by one, and a zen like sense of achievement washes over me. Immediately, though, I am distracted by a group of lads sat behind me; they are talking heavy Warhammer and a discussion has just broken out about one of them using the wrong paint for the wrong army. I waddle home from the station in Edinburgh, retracing my very early steps. My Pilgrimage is done and I am home once more. I never expected to find God, nor spiritual enlightenment, but I wish I had found more toilets and a steadier way to get across the Forth. In the morning I fly to Portugal, and have heard from reliable sources that Pilgrims do well there. But we shall see.

I'm on the journey I've waited for my entire life - and I want to remember it! Updates on my adjustment to British life, foreign travel, and all things abroad.

Mist rises. Saturday morning lacks the alarm clock. A full backpack sits in on a desk, waiting for me to pick it up and go. My second trip to Scotland’s capital. My first journey alone.
Sure, there are plenty of people to invite, but it’s mid-semester and students are swamped with projects. Not me — I only have two classes — so the desire to leave Stirling lures me to Edinburgh.
I rise at 7:32 despite no alarm. Twenty minutes. A comb strikes through my hair, gloss rubs across my lips, and I exit my bedroom with no regrets. The 7:52 bus doesn’t come until around 8:00; only four students sit at the stop. When I reach the train station, I catch a breath and keep going. I can’t back out now. I’m doing this for myself.
I buy a ticket for the 8:30 train and wait in the cold, open-aired platform. The squeaky wheels rush into the station and I enter with old women and old men. There’s an empty window seat, just for me. I listen to headphones and try not to drift back to sleep; only an hour until I arrive to my first destination.
Before I came to Scotland, when I watched videos of the best sites to visit in places like Edinburgh, I learned one of the cafes is marked as the location JK Rowling scratched the Harry Potter series on napkins. As soon as I step out of Edinburgh Waverley, I walk nine short minutes to The Elephant House, a near hole-in-the-wall restaurant with humble service (and filled with decorative elephants!). I order a cinnamon latte to get in the fall spirit, grab a seat at the front window, and open my laptop to Word. For the next hour, beside an Uber driver reading his morning paper, I write and edit and complete a chapter of my new novel, Floor Number Nine. It is the perfect rainy October morning. And While the street view is gorgeous, it makes me feel special when tourists stop in front of the window to take photographs of the cafe. For all they know, I’m a local!
When the waitress asks to take the empty plates, I understand I’ve overstayed my welcome, so I quickly save the final page of the chapter and stuff the laptop inside my backpack. Raincoat on, I flip the hood over my hair and search the next destination, the Writer’s Museum.
This free attraction is a short walk, tucked in a courtyard behind the skinny Lady Stair’s Close. It’s a quirky house with an open door and a sign which reads: Robert Louis Stevenson — Downstairs. Glad to get out of the rain, I step into the warm museum, greeted by photographs and displays. Stephenson’s original works, family portraits, and even household furniture (that I could touch!). After this exhibit, I return upstairs to a warm living room, complete with a fireplace, chandelier, wooden paneling, and old couples enjoying their morning tea. I learn this building was built in the 1620’s and belonged to Lady Stair.
Upstairs, exhibitions of poet Robert Burns and famous writer Sir Walter Scott decorate the traditional rooms. From chess boards, to cotton caps, to quill pens, I explore the artifacts of writers I’d read in grade school.
Returning to the rainy city, I walk a few blocks until I reach St. Giles Cathedral. This time, I don’t take pictures; I focus on the moment, soaking in the gorgeous stained glass, gazing at the vaulted ceilings, and listening to a pastor read Psalms to a quiet audience.
The National Museum of Scotland is not far from this cathedral. While this modern building seems bland on the exterior, its structure is fascinating. Totaling 6 floors, this museum is a maze of ancient and modern exhibits. I spend an hour and a half starting upstairs and working my way down. The map lists highlighted attractions, so I go in search for these — the canteen of Bonnie Prince Charlie, the clay creations of Picasso, ornate jewelry crafted by women centuries ago. What I find most intriguing is Dolly the cloned sheep. When I spot the thick glass case, I step as close as possible to the famous animal, surprised to learn the embryo was cloned in a Scottish laboratory. It is surreal, staring into the real eyes of the sheep I briefly studied in ninth grade biology.
I check the time on my phone and decide to move on to the next location. I’ve made plans to visit Dean Village, a quaint section outside of the inner city. Google Maps says it is a twenty-five minute walk, and I head down the street with an eager spirit. The rain is gone, fog rolls above the Edinburgh Castle, and I’m immersed in the perfect autumnal aesthetic.
I see a pub with a recognizable heading: Greyfriar’s Bobby. The church behind it is surrounded by a famous kirkyard (graveyard) where a dog, Greyfriar’s Bobby, is buried. While I don’t understand the significance of the dog or his master, I pass the pub and enter the church, expecting to find another intricate cathedral. While the interior is less impressive (I accidentally get lost, enter a set of closed doors, and find myself in the office rooms in the second level of the church), a guide leads me to the dog’s grave. Covered with a half-empty bush, the stone is planted directly in front of the church, marking the loyal dog who lived for sixteen years.
Large tour groups stroll through the foggy graveyard; I make my own rounds, using the time to take photographs of the fog-covered steeples and creepy tombstones. The perfect October location.
When you pass the statue of the beloved dog, right beside the Greyfriar’s pub, you are supposed to rub its nose for good luck. Not knowing this, I (uneducated American that I am) simply stroke the bronze fur and continue down the path on Google Maps. I have to see Dean Village, after all!
But another cathedral catches my eye. And after stopping inside, I recognize the brand names of giant stores across the road — I’ve made it to the shopping district. Princes Street, specifically. Across from me lies a Starbucks, an Urban Outfitters, a Primark, and a TopShop. I know where I’m headed after the village.
As directed by Google Maps, I hike down a hill under a bridge. It is darker now, and quieter, but I’m confident the destination will be worth the trek. The closer I get, however, (a sign on a building reads: Dean Village — This Way), the emptier and emptier the streets become. Eventually, as I step into the picaresque location, I walk alone. The cobblestone streets are wet. I slip clumsily down the hill onto my back, and no one is there to help me up.
This is okay. Laughing, I continue to walk down the street and cross a bridge. At first, the lack of shops and people makes the village underwhelming, but then I take gorgeous photos of the landscape, and I am fully content.
Tired and ready for rest, I return to Princes Street and enter the Starbucks. Here, I charge my phone, find some free WiFi, and eat a snack to prepare for the rest of the afternoon.
On the way to the Sir Walter Scott monument, I am captivated by a baroque-looking steeple. The cathedral, St. Mary’s Cathedral, is enormous, and I’m shocked I’ve never heard of the church until now. I walk down a broad street, full of wide marble buildings and Scottish flags, until I reach the front door and stroll inside. Again, my breath is taken:
Of course, photographs never capture the true atmosphere of cathedrals!
The Sir Walter Scott Monument is the largest and tallest monument to a writer in the world. As a creative writing major, this should impress me — and it does, however, this is the only site which requires a fee to enter. So I don’t. I do walk around the garden, stare up at the statue of Scott himself, and take plenty of photographs with the structure.
For the rest of the evening, I pass the time until my 5:30 train with shopping. Urban Outfitters has a 70% off sale. The Primark consists of three whole stories. I dip into Top Shop (because I’ve never been to a physical store before) as well as H&M, and before I know it, I’m racing through a line to purchase souvenirs before rushing to catch the train.
My first trip alone in the nation’s capitol. Needless to say, I am proud of myself and all the locations I am able to visit. Days like these help solidify my decision to study abroad; I need them, because if I’m honest, sometimes I feel like I made a mistake in thinking I could last four months here. Foreign travel, especially without any friends or relatives to travel with, is frightening. But it is also thrilling, and it calls me. Days like this prove I am up for the challenge.

Part Two of our Three Part coverage of the 2023 Edinburgh Festival Fringe.Find Part One here.Find Part Three here.
In 1947, a post-WW2 Europe came together to celebrate the arts at the newly formed Edinburgh International Festival. Eight theatre companies who had not been invited decided to show up anyway, and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe was created — the first-ever “Fringe Festival.” Since then, cities around the world have formed their own versions of the Fringe, but the original remains the largest. In fact, it holds the record as the largest performing arts festival in the world.
For its 2023 edition, 3,553 shows graced 288 venues all across the city — transforming the medieval streets of the Scottish capital into a bustling hub of creativity. With so many productions during the festival’s three-and-a-half-week run, crafting an itinerary proved to be a daunting task. But with the help of a few Excel spreadsheets, a good pair of walking shoes, and a very full calendar, I was able to see 57 shows during my seven days in Edinburgh — a mere 1.6% of the overall lineup, but a solid dive into the Fringe’s immersive offerings.
Here are my fifteen favorite immersive shows from the 2023 Edinburgh Festival Fringe (including a few in the Edinburgh International Festival):
Big Kid Kindergarten — Play Immersive (USA)
As adults, we don’t often get the time, space, or permission to play. Interests become hobbies become side hustles, and unstructured play is set aside in favor of adulting. Big Kid Kindergarten invites us to reconnect with our childhood selves.
At the beginning of the experience, Soleil Kohl, our teacher for the next hour, asks us to close our eyes and connect with our inner five-year-old. A variety of familiar items are strewn across the room — legos, Play-Doh, coloring books, crafting materials, and plushies. We choose the songs that play in the background — nursery rhymes, Barney, Sharon Lois & Bram — the soundtrack of our childhoods. As our class time comes to an end, we tidy up the space and then cuddle up with a pillow for a quick nap time.
It’s a simple concept and straightforward execution, but a surprisingly emotional experience for some (myself included) largely due to the insight, guidance, and warmth with which Kohl facilitates.
Bodies — Ray Young (UK)
After a twenty-minute Scotrail ride away from the bustle of the festival city, I find myself floating in the pool at Deans Community High School. Colored lights, a sprinkler, and miscellaneous inflatables scatter across the surface of the water. We’ve all been given the identity of a specific international body of water and told that this pool is the gathering place where we’re all to connect. Twinkling projections fill the space and soothing music fills the air.
There’s an oft-used analogy of immersive theatre being likened to immersion in water. As such, the venue and conceit of Bodies seem quite fitting. Though the show offers little in terms of narrative, the space became a place for meditation, and a welcome moment of calm amongst the busyness of the Festival.
Brave Space — Aloft (USA)
We stand gathered around a sheet. When given the signal, our hands grasp its edges and we lift it above our heads, walk underneath, and then lower it beneath our feet. We’ve built a big top, but this one is more intimate than most — the quarters are cramped such that the delineation between stage and audience is blurred. Hoops spin unnervingly close by, acrobats swing from a trapeze directly above my head, and props are handed to us for safekeeping. At one point, I hold onto a piece of rope alongside four other audience members while the performers, kept aloft by the rope and their trust in a handful of strangers, twirl in the air.
‘Audience participation’ and ‘acrobatics’ are two phrases that don’t often appear together. The latter requires peak physical conditioning, hours of practice, and great technical ability… the former an unpredictable entity. By combining these two, Aloft has created a genuine immersive circus experience and necessitated the creation of a brave, trusting, space on both sides to make it work.
Club Life — Fred Deakin (UK)
In Club Life, Fred Deakin tours us through the Edinburgh underground club scene of the 80s and 90s that he helped shape. But this exercise goes beyond a typical bout of reminiscing — instead of simply telling us about the parties he lovingly crafted and DJ’d, Deakin invites us onto the dancefloor to experience them ourselves.
With a few DJ decks, vinyl records, and a cast of dancers, key moments in Deakin’s musical life are recreated onstage. From the genre agnosticism of Thunderball to the delightfully quirky Misery (“the worst club night that there ever was or ever could be,”) we dance our way through seven distinct parties from his past.
Part dance party, part autobiography, Club Life is an engaging and heartwarming deep dive into a creative soul.
Ctrl Room :_ — Black Hound Productions (UK)
In the not-so-distant future, technology has changed the face of the battlefield. Armed with lethal AI innovations, tech giant Polemas has become a global military powerhouse. As I enter the Edinburgh Army Reserve Centre, I’m greeted by a uniformed individual. Are they part of the show or an army member using the space? This blurring of show vs. reality was present throughout the experience and contributed to Ctrl Room :_ being the most immersive production I attended during the festival.
After choosing to align myself with the civilian resistance, I’m brought to their control room. Over the next 60 minutes, we identify an aerial strike drone, build explosive weapons, devise a military strategy, and attempt to decode a mysterious device. Meanwhile, our opponents at Polemas work through their own set of challenges, and every action, puzzle solved, and decision made by both sides influences the final outcome.
Throughout, our rebel leaders emphasize the urgency of the task at hand — some of the best acting I’ve ever seen in an escape room environment. The overall experience felt so realistic that at one point I found myself cowering under a table in genuine fear. As we exited the room for the finale, bulletproof vests on our chests and Molotov cocktails in hand, I mentally steeled myself for the battlefield… then breathed a sigh of relief when we were instead led to a cutscene in the initial briefing room.
Food — Geoff Sobelle (USA) [International Festival]
Food is a playful and thoughtful exploration of society’s relationship with food — from the grandiosity of the fine dining industry to the humble origins, and increasingly complicated reality of the agricultural systems that feed us.
While sitting around a large fine dining table, Sobelle hands me a wine menu with a very specific set of instructions: I should not drink the glass of wine he’s about to pour for me. Instead, I’m asked to smell the liquid and connect the scent to a year and memory. The odor of whiteboard marker fills my nose and I share an early high school memory. A mix of magic, cleverness, and absurdity brings this half of the show to life. An order of salmon rolls is conjured from thin air, an impromptu trip to the “Arctic” produces the freshest of arctic char, and our enigmatic waiter decides to scarf down all the leftovers. The magic elements may not be the most elegant I’ve seen — Sobelle’s sleight of hand is at times visible, but this is easily forgiven as the true magic lies in the delightful absurdity of the situation.
As the restaurant “closes” for the night, Sobelle pulls the tablecloth off — dishes and all — to reveal a large surface of dirt underneath. He crawls into the space, unaffected by the damage being done to his dress shirt and slacks. From here, a once chatty Sobelle guides us in a silent demonstration of the industrialization of farming, as well as the infrastructure and communities that we built around it.
They say it’s bad manners to play with your food, but for Geoff Sobelle I think we can make an exception. With charm and a healthy dose of playfulness, Food is a thoughtful and whimsical meditation on an important industry.
Funeral — Ontroerend Goed (Belgium)
“If you want to remember, remember.If you want to forget, forget.But sometimes, when you want to remember you forget.But sometimes, when you want to forget your remember”
So go the translated lyrics of the Latin song we’re taught at the beginning of Funeral. The show, by immersive stalwarts Ontroerend Goed, is a collective ritual celebrating finiteness and the knowledge that we are not alone in whatever endings we mourn.
From start to end, Funeral emphasizes the importance of community. In one of the most unique openings I’ve experienced, we’re directed to shake hands with each and every audience member as we enter the room. Later, we pass logs down from person to person until each individual has a post to sit on. At the start of the show, we are offered the chance to share the names of those we are mourning. As these names are read out loud, I feel my eyes prickle with tears, and look around the room to see my emotions mirrored in the faces of others.
The most notable display of community-building that Funeral initiated was inviting people to the venue’s basement for a cup of post-show tea. This created a space where audience members could unpack the experience together. While many shows at this year’s Fringe emphasized the importance of community and connection, Funeral’s poignant joint rituals and creation of space for discussion made it the most successful at exploring these themes.
Hayfever — Emerge Production House (UK)
Hayfever has the honor of being the “fringiest” show I had the pleasure of seeing at the festival.
As I walk into the room, a hot pink gorilla hands me two pieces of cardstock, one red and one green. We’re told that we’re actually in outer space and part of the studio audience for a TV show. At certain times, we can vote for an outcome using our colored cards, and at any point in the show, we can pause the action to request a monologue, a musical theatre number, an interpretive dance, or an on-the-spot “auction” of any item on stage. All the while, a drama about love, murder, xenophobia, and feminism unfolds.
It sounds chaotic, and once us audience members get the hang of things, it absolutely is. Heartfelt speeches are interrupted by songs about ham; during an auction, I deprive the male lead of his glasses; a monologue reveals the nefarious purpose this television program serves and the classist structures that keep it running. There’s too much going on, and the ambitiousness of the conceit often leaves me confused, but it’s just so much fun.
Klanghaus: Darkroom — KlangHaus (UK)
“Try and keep your eyes open.” But as I sit alone in the church basement, the lights starting to dim, the urge to shut my eyes is persistent. Eyes-open darkness is a very different sensation from eyes-closed darkness. Music fills the air, and I feel my body begin to relax. As the sound of waves crashing fills the room, the percussive reverberation of drums fills my chest. I didn’t notice at first, but live instruments are being played all around me. I’ve become so accustomed to pre-recorded sound within immersive audio experiences, so this realization catches me off guard and leaves me with a giant grin.
As the music calms to silence, the lights switch on and I’m escorted onto a couch. There, I unpack the experience with the two musicians who moved from instrument to instrument — counting their steps in the dark — to perform for me.
Whereas Klanghaus’ other Fringe show, Klanghaus: Inhaus, is a communal audio-visual experience, Darkroom is its antithesis — a solo experience in the dark. Both allowed me to engage in the music on a deeper level, but in the eyes wide open darkness of Klanghaus: Darkroom, I felt an intense, personal connection with the music.
Lucy and Friends — Soho Theatre, John Mackay and United Agents (UK)
After being recommended the show by a friend, I purchased a ticket to Lucy and Friends — an effort to diversify my Fringe showgoing. Halfway through the opening number, while covered in confetti and being crawled on by a tree cosplayer, I realized this show would probably count as immersive.
Lucy and Friends is a one-woman show where the role of “Lucy” is performed by the absurdly hilarious Lucy McCormick, and the role of “Friends” is played by the entire audience. Song sheets are distributed as we enter the venue, glasses of wine are shared with the audience, and we’re even tasked with cleaning up the theater. At the end of the show, a cell phone is passed around and audience members enter their contact info to start a group text chat.
Hilarious and unexpected, Lucy and Friends consistently caught me off guard while I absolutely laughed my head off.
Sensuous Governing — Sisters Hope (Denmark)
A line forms outside the Danish Consulate building, where a veiled figure in a white blouse and floor-length skirt stands barefoot. One by one, she beckons us forward and instructs us to remain silent as we fill out a cryptic questionnaire about the current state of our body, mind, and society as a whole.
Thus, began one of the most curious and thought-provoking experiences I had throughout my time at the Fringe. Over the next hour and a half I dance with a stranger, engage in a tender staring contest, and walk blindfolded up a spiral staircase. Throughout, the ethereal “Sisters” serve as my guide, their every motion a delicate dance whose tenderness I can sense even with my eyes bound.
It’s difficult to describe what makes Sensuous Governing so beautiful. It’s a strange experience, and will definitely leave some participants skeptical, but I also found it incredibly moving. As I exited the building, I locked eyes with another audience member. We tried to discuss what we had both just experienced but were at a loss for words — perhaps in part a side effect of having remained silent for so long. Finally, we both agreed, “That was really special.”
The Lost Lending Library — Punchdrunk Enrichment (UK) [International Festival]
At 314 floors high and with 78 spiral-side departments, this library is the largest collection of books and stories in the entire world. But, as the title suggests, it’s currently lost and we’ll need some expert-level storytellers to find it.
The Lost Lending Library by Punchdrunk Enrichment (Punchdrunk’s educational and outreach arm) is an enchanting immersive experience designed for children. The show is a fine example of entertainment talking to children rather than talking down to them, and in doing so creates a memorable experience for both kids and their accompanying adults. Throughout the performance, the actors engage directly with the young audience members, who field every query and conversation with an ease and creativity far superior to what you’d ever find in an adult audience.
Once we do find the library, even the most skeptical of adults is in awe. The set is absolutely gorgeous, filled with intricate details and surprises to be uncovered. It’s a real treat to see Punchdrunk’s immersive magic go to work at teaching the importance of storytelling. As we leave the library, we’re each handed a special “library card,” and from the squeals of excitement this garners, you can tell that Punchdrunk’s teachings have made a genuine impact.
The Most Toast — RGB Monster (UK)
The premise is simple: “Somebody in the audience will have eaten the most toast. We will find them.”
Armed with a large piece of chart paper, a permanent marker, and a wonderfully dry sense of wit, hosts Katharyn Henson and Ollie Horn interrogate the audience as to the quantity of their toast consumption. Approximations are not permitted. Uncertainty is dismissed. This is a serious scientific inquiry, and they accept nothing but precise measurements.
Charts are charted. Calculators are utilized. Integrity is called into question. Then, a winner is chosen and brought onstage for a celebration fitting of a toast-eating champion. The Most Toast is what happens when a brilliantly simple hook, a quick-witted pair of hosts, and an enthusiastic audience come together. It’s everything it’s advertised to be, but with a level of commitment that elevates its silliness into hilarity.
Two Strangers Walk Into A Bar — Tilda Cobham-Hervey (Australia)
I sit down at a bar. Someone hands me a suspiciously heavy tote bag and a headset, then tells me everything I’ll need is contained within. And that’s how my meet-cute begins… but maybe reality has different plans.
Through a series of audio prompts, worksheets, and semi-scripted dialogue, Two Strangers Walk Into A Bar creates the circumstances for a real-life rom-com to unfold. Except, instead of falling in love with a stranger, all that quirkiness and convenient serendipity sets you up to fall in love with that beautiful, messy, unpredictable thing called real life.
Humanity-affirming, grin-inducing, and absolutely charming, Two Strangers Walk Into A Bar is one of the most memorable immersive experiences I’ve ever had.
Without Sin — Without Sin (Ireland)
Two strangers enter a confessional booth and through a series of guided questions leave with a knowledge of the other far greater than what a typical 20-minute conversation would create.
As I step inside the dimly lit booth, I slip the provided headphones over my ears. Soothing music fills the space, and a voice instructs me to open the slot on my right where a deck of cards is placed. One by one, my companion and I take turns drawing from the pile and asking each other the questions written on them. “Have you ever taken something that wasn’t yours?” “What’s something you used to believe that you don’t anymore?” “Who are you most worried about disappointing?” We volley back and forth, sometimes offering elaborate responses, other times opting for more cryptic answers. Unable to see the face of our partner, all we can do is focus on the inflections in their voice.
The end of the experience arrives all too soon, and we are prompted to write a note to our partner. I reflect on the morsels of truth and vulnerability she shared and pen a heartfelt wish for a stranger I barely know, yet find myself rooting for. As we exit the booth, we embrace, squeezing each other tight through slightly teary eyes. Human connection is a beautiful thing, and Without Sin fosters it in a simple, but beautiful way.

Edinburgh is a haunted city.
I don’t mean ‘haunted’ in the supernatural sense, although I could point with my eyes closed and manage to hit several Ghost Tour aficionados who would be only too happy to prove me wrong. No, I mean ‘haunted’ in the sense that the city is a duology — ancient meets modern, and the ghosts of old Dùn èideann certainly haven’t gone to rest.
I have a friend from elsewhere who described Edinburgh as ‘having a quality’, and it does. The city is at home in all of its guises: tourist trap, hyperactive university town, well-to-do business capital. It is at once surprising and satisfying to see a place that wears all sorts of coats throughout the year, and it looks fabulous doing so. She may be many things, but the one thing she never is — under-dressed.
She also bleeds history. Walk across North Bridge, and you’ll find yourself in the heart of Edinburgh’s Old Town. And by ‘old’, we mean OLD. Your feet will find the gaps between cobbled streets that haven’t been updated since they were first laid, and if you look up at any building, you’ll see the ghosts of Edinburgh’s past, beautifully rendered in the form of intricate cornices, gargoyles and ornate carvings. Find yourself a close (Scottish word for tiny little street) and you’ll realise how little has actually been changed. These narrow streets are thrilling reminders of a long ago world that somehow still exists here, quietly maintaining a link to Scottish history.
It’s easy, standing in the shadow of Castle Rock on a winter’s day, to hear the bustle that would have been. Edinburgh captures our past, and feeds it to us in tiny mouthfuls. You don’t HAVE to look, but if you do, you’ll see stories in the walls. You’ll see markings and numbers left over from the original craftsmen. You’ll see heavy brass doorbells that no longer sing, but sit now as silent sentinels. In some houses and flats, original features languish beside modern conveniences: a Belfast sink next to a toaster, elegant sash windows behind a widescreen tv or immensely high ceilings looking down at a state of the art computer. It’s a quiet kind of ghost, but an effective haunting nonetheless.
It helps that we love our history, and we do everything we can to preserve it. Hardly any older buildings in Edinburgh get demolished and built up again. We’re used to re-purposing what is old, because although it is old, it is not broken. It’s a part of us, of our bones. They may creak, but they still function. As a result, new shop names are placed under carvings and signs that still bear the moniker of a store from decades ago. These things, they tell us where we’ve come from, and it seems important to the deep consciousness of Scotland to know this, to feel it. It’s the reason we sing ‘Auld Lang Syne’ at Hogmanay, and still compete in Highland Games. It would be a travesty to lose this unconscious memory of who we once were, to be out of touch with the stories of our national identity.
There is grandeur, too, in the ghost of our city. St Giles cathedral is a towering exercise in gothic beauty, sitting as it does, amongst tourist shops and chain restaurants. George Heriots School is a literal castle, complete with turrets, grand chamber rooms and teachers who flit about, crow-like, in antiquated robes. It inspired Hogwarts, after all, and it’s easy to see why. The city’s ghosts have magic. It is a type of grandeur that we so often overlook in our modern lives. Most of us spend our days in front of screens, from the ever increasingly large screens of our smartphones, to the computers that fill our thousands of offices. If we tried, we probably could spend an entire day never looking up or away from the eye-straining technology we rely on. This is not necessarily an evil — technology has allowed us to progress faster in the last 100 years than in the preceding 1000, but it does mean that we are in increasing danger of losing something precious — our historic identity.
So if you find yourself walking the cobbled streets of Edinburgh, take a moment to look. Look past the throngs of people hurrying against the sideways Scottish wind. Look past the brightly coloured lights of Christmas, or the sheer spectacle that is the Edinburgh Fringe. Instead, look for things that breathe quietly but do not speak. Look for the things that tell little stories of the past. Don’t worry, Edinburgh’s ghosts are friendly, and like all good Scots, incredibly welcoming hosts.

At the castle no one was royal. They dragged along their common provenances, hometowns banging around on the cobblestones behind them like oxygen tanks keeping them all alive. In front of me an American woman blathered on about history to the cashier, a Scottish man who looked like he had fought in both World Wars and developed all of his wrinkles by falling asleep face first on presidential biographies.
“We don’t have castles in America, because that’s when the Native Americans were there,” she said, word for word, in a baby voice.
She suggested that he really should make time to visit the northern seaside, and named a town there that she had liked in the way an aristocrat might say Cartier to the homeless. He gave her a scathing look, as though pounding waves of his battle-spilled ancestral blood had carved the very contours of the Scottish coastline, and handed her a ticket.
It was my turn. He asked me where I was from.
“Canada,” I lied, so as not to be associated by a commonality as thin as nationality with the woman who preceded me.
The tickets were £19.50, about $30 USD. At least it’s free to visit the White House. In the end we always have things going for us.
Beyond the ticket gate the grey stones of Edinburgh Castle were rain-soaked to black. The other tourists and I became zombies at the behest of our individualized audio tours, wandering around the grounds glassy-eyed, bits of history lost on our daydreaming, foreign minds. A group of unruly schoolchildren sat on the ground eating oranges. Citrus disagreeably robbed the air of its earthiness, its wet stones, dirt and gunpowder. When it was time for a lesson the children fled, leaving their modern trash behind, fruit juice bottles, orange peels and plastic Lidl shopping bags crinkling in the wind. The base of the only remaining segment of the twelfth century castle looked like a littered patch of Interstate 405.
I found the American woman from the ticket line, now with her husband, at an overlook on the far side of the castle. The sheer rock faces of the Salisbury Crags angled skyward like a drawn knife over the grasses of Holyrood Park. Gothic spires formed the black peaks of Edinburgh’s jagged old skyline.
“They have castles poppin’ up outta nowhere!” cried the husband. He wore a knit Denver Broncos ski hat, shifted his weight in basketball shoes, and jingled the coins in his pocket. He gave the impression that he was agitated about missing a football game. At the time it was 3:00am in Denver, and a Tuesday at that.
“Fhak. That’s fhaking beautiful. I could live heah. I could live heah no problem,” said another man taking in the view. He had a big pink face wet with sweat. He pulled off a fleece sweatshirt and revealed a Red Sox t-shirt with Yastrzemski printed on the back. His friend was in a MIT Campus police sweatshirt. They wore their hometown like house keys on cords around the necks of little boys. Everything about them said that they belonged to somewhere else. They would never fall through the cracks of this or that ancient city. They would always be pointed home.
All of the tourists gathered around a fancily dressed solider giving an inaudible speech in front of a cannon. They held up digital cameras, iPads and phones and littered the space with the garbage of beep-beeps and misappropriated flashes illuminating nothing.
He fired the cannon. An explosion burst forth and its burned debris floated softly in the wind, like gentle little murderers. We all gasped and screamed. The sexy girl next to me jumped a mile and swore in some foreign language. She had an underfed waist and overinflated breasts. She wore tight, cheaply embroidered jeans and wobbled on the cobblestones in leopard print high heels. She looked around uneasily, like an alligator in a pit of marshmallows, looking for purchase for her assets, and found none.
We dragged each other back to the places that possessed us. The black castle left no mark. Its glitter and prestige did not dull our nationalities. It did not obliterate the ways our countries teach us to behave.
We don’t have castles in America.
To us castles are cartoons, the candy-colored settings of fairytales. I wanted an abandoned glass slipper on the steps. I wanted three drops of blood in the freshly fallen snow. I would never have expected that kind of magic out of the White House. I was trapped in the Disney tower of my American girlhood, just as obviously from my own country as everyone else.
On my way out, the field-tripping children were running around the tiny rooms of the oldest, darkest part of the castle. The cried out ghost sounds and giggled in delight at the creepy echoes of their own voices, bouncing off the walls of dirt and stone, returning right back to them.
Thanks so much for reading.
I would be thrilled if you clicked “Recommend” below. You can also sign up for my newsletter. I’ll email next time I take a trip and have something for you to read.
For now I have other posts on Belfast, Vegas, Santorini, Isle of Skye and Boston.

What I loved about Edinburgh was being able to walk to work through a beautiful place.
– Roger Allam
Sangam and I visited Edinburgh with our friends in December 2023. We visited this charming city for a day trip.
It was a long drive from Newcastle upon Tyne to Edinburgh for us. As we drove towards Edinburgh, we doubted if it was a good decision to drive in this weather. The weather was worse with heavy rains and harsh wind. Driving became extremely difficult and tedious for us. However, we managed to reach Edinburgh around 2 p.m.
It was still cloudy, but we were glad that it was at least not raining. We wasted no time and decided to search for a restaurant for lunch. The experience of walking around the city was incredibly beautiful and surreal. The place was as charming and exquisite as I had read in the books.

Background: In 2022, the Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (TAS) programme funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) brought together experts in key disciplines across the UK to investigate the responsibility dimension of AI-driven autonomous systems, especially in areas where we might realistically expect that AI systems will be used to complement or substitute for human decision making.
On the 10th of July 2023, the four Responsibility project teams met in Edinburgh, Scotland to share the preliminary findings of our research, and to identify any common ground across our very different approaches to the challenge, which range across computer science, robotics, philosophy, law and the social sciences. Our declaration here, which will soon be followed by an expanded version including concrete examples of application to AI and autonomous systems, reflects that common ground.
We hope it will start a wider conversation about what matters most when we talk about “Responsible AI’ and responsibility for autonomous systems.*
*This declaration is a collaboration among researchers in the UKRI Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (TAS) programme who work on Responsibility in the context of design, development, procurement, use, governance and regulation of AI and autonomous systems. It does not necessarily represent the views of the wider TAS programme, its partners or universities.
Preface: Our work has crystallised a shared belief in the possibility of responsible development and governance of AI and autonomous systems (AI/AS). However novel the challenges these technologies present, they are not beyond the reach of responsibility, as a set of mature social and technical practices that underpin trustworthiness. We have been here before, with other inherently risky technologies that seemed ungovernable. And yet, those technologies that became part of the trusted infrastructure of many societies — biomedical technologies, aviation, automobiles, steam power — are now largely governed in ways that enable innovation and its benefits without pushing all of the risk and cost onto unprotected publics.
We must advance AI/AS innovation toward its own stage of trusted maturity: by creating, promoting, and embedding robust and committed responsibility practices in the development and use of AI/AS. Our joint declaration proposes four shifts in the framing of responsibility that we believe are needed for the responsible development, procurement, use and governance of AI and autonomous systems, in the UK and beyond.
First, it may help to briefly clarify some of the different meanings that ‘responsibility’ can have in this context:
Four Key Shifts on Responsibility Needed to Achieve Responsible AI
1. Accepting responsibility over describing and ascribing responsibility
2. Seeing responsibility as relational over seeing responsibility as an agent property
3. Prioritising responsibility as attending to vulnerability over responsibility as blame
4. Focusing on sustainability of responsible AI/AS innovation over pace of innovation
ANALYSIS:
Our research projects draw from technical, social, and humanistic disciplines to study distinct forms of responsibility (moral, legal, causal, role or virtue) as they apply in practice to responsible AI and autonomous systems (AI/AS) development, deployment and governance. Much of our work describes how, when, and which of these notions of responsibility should be attributed to the different types of agents (human and machine) that make up sociotechnical systems like AI/AS.
A deep understanding of these dimensions is essential for the future of responsible AI/AS. Appeals to responsibility are only effective when we can be clear and specific about what it means in any given context. But we hold that however rigorous our research on responsibility, its future impact depends upon the collective will of the actors who shape and govern our tech ecosystem to act on it.
Responsibility can be analysed in minute detail, but if responsibility is never accepted, never taken by the actors with the power to do so, these studies will be impotent, their power to guide action wasted. Our research must, to have its intended impact, be paired with bold and ongoing commercial and public commitments to accept responsibility for the power and consequences of autonomous systems.
2. Seeing responsibility as relational over responsibility as an agent property
The single thread that binds our projects is the power of responsibility to enable and sustain trustworthy relationships between people, organisations, institutions and publics. How AI/AS impact these relationships is why responsibility matters in this context.
Yet responsibility is too often viewed solely as an isolated property of an agent or system. We seek to find the ‘responsible’ component that caused a harm or accident, or the ‘responsible’ human that is morally accountable or legally liable for it, without considering the relationships that such attributions of responsibility help to hold together.
Even when we seek to understand what makes an agent in some way responsible for an action or decision, it’s the human relationships affected by that action or decision that make this question so important for us to answer. These relationships, and the responsibilities they entail, vary and shift over time and in different contexts. For this reason, mere promises to ‘act responsibly’ or ‘design responsibly’ are less helpful than articulating the ongoing, evolving duties of care that publics rightly expect and that people, organisations and institutions must fulfil to protect the specific relationships in which they and AI/AS are embedded. We hold that the relationships that responsibility serves must move to the centre of ‘responsible AI/AS’ research and its uses.
3. Prioritising responsibility as attending to vulnerability over responsibility as blame
Most studies of responsibility in AI/AS focus on mechanisms for responsibility attribution and the distribution of blame, liability or other obligations to responsible parties. While this work is essential, it is often silent about the vital political function of responsibility: to establish conditions of legitimacy for the human exercise of power, by requiring those who use or unleash a power to demonstrate due care for the interests of those it makes vulnerable.
While we must do more to identify and hold accountable those who use AI/AS in irresponsible and harmful ways, responsible AI/AS is not merely about finding and sanctioning ‘bad actors.’ All who exercise and unleash the material and economic power of AI/AS, even with the best of intentions, must start attending — and be required to attend — responsibly to the vulnerabilities that AI/AS create, perpetuate, amplify or relieve.
Foregrounding the needs of the most vulnerable, led by their knowledge of the lived impact of new technologies, also generally results in better protections for all; it is the most reliable way to ensure that AI/AS are safe and beneficial for everyone. Otherwise, by unjustly endangering human lives and publics, those who build and deploy these tools surrender the social license for these technologies as legitimate powers.
4. Focusing on sustainability of responsible AI/AS innovation over pace of innovation
Much of the debate around AI and autonomous systems focuses on the ideal pace of responsible innovation — calls to speed it up (for those whose primary aim is economic growth and rapid realization of technology’s potential benefits) and calls to slow it down (for those whose primary aim is the safety, security and competent control of AI/AS).
While this debate exposes important concerns, we think both impulses result from a misplaced focus on the overall pace at which AI/AS innovation happens, rather than what is needed to make AI/AS innovation sustainable, in the UK and globally.
Some applications of AI/AS, for example in the health and climate tech areas, warrant accelerated research and development, in responsible ways. Others, such as the automation of moral and political human judgments with irreversible and severe consequences, arguably require delay or indefinite pause. Yet we call for centering the overarching question: how to make a responsible AI/AS innovation ecosystem sustainable.
Sluggish AI/AS innovation that stalls from lack of investment and public confidence will not serve the UK or the world well. Yet neither will rapid, unchecked innovation that lasts only a few years or decades before running out of public goodwill and available resources.
AI/AS are already placing great demands on our limited global resources (water, energy, rare earth minerals), new stresses on social and economic resilience, and growing challenges for security, human rights and social cohesion. These costs and stressors must be managed responsibly and holistically, with an eye to AI/AS innovation that can take us all much farther, not simply faster.
We invite those from across the ‘Responsible AI’ community and beyond to comment and help us develop and refine these provocations; in the coming weeks we will share an expanded version with concrete examples of applications of these four shifts in Responsible AI research and innovation.

Usually I try to write a snappy intro, but I’ve a bit of a headache and honestly the headline and deck have all the basics. Let’s get into it.

Tucked around the corner from Wembley Stadium is a more quirky arena: the setting for Enitan’s Game, a kid-friendly hour-long experience for Punchdrunkards (and other immersive enthusiasts) and their children. Telling the story of a family’s tradition of community play, visitors are quickly swept up in the frenzy of joining in one more round of the game invented by Enitan’s grandfather before his life celebration takes place.
I attend one of the standard sessions where children are expected, so while the kids take the lion’s share of participation and I don’t have much to do myself I’m still charmed and enthralled by the standard Punchdrunk-quality bells and whistles: the endearing pack-rat-yet-curated style of set design with light, sound, and haze all are there in the expert quality of execution we’ve come to expect. There’s a few surprising special effects: a Jumanji moment bewitches the group and elicits a few gasps from both generations, and there are one or two spooky moments that coast the edge between adolescence and mature thrills. I do have a couple calls to action but generally the grown-ups are there to watch the joy and wonder on the kids’ faces and to listen to the endearing story told by the two actors. There are adults-only sessions which welcome guests with a cocktail and close with a Q&A with members of the cast & creative team, but I’m assured by the host that the show runs exactly the same for both age groups; no changes to plot or acting style is made.
It’s prudent to note here that Punchdrunk Enrichment is a sister & separate company of Punchdrunk, and therefore while they share some fundamental members and elemental values they are not the same. Punchdrunk Enrichment’s design emphasis appears to be placed on gameplay and narrative, rather than the aesthetic and mature tones adult audiences have come to expect from sister company Punchdrunk; this is consistent with P.E.’s goal of creating experiences for education, community, and family audiences. Visitors would be wise to note this if planning a visit.
We’re all in favor of early indoctrination of the next generation of immersive enthusiasts & creators, and what better way than to pivot one of the biggest names in the game to get hold of ‘em early? Bring the kids (or borrow some) and start the journey together; Enitan’s Game is an ace in the hole.

Generative Artificial Intelligence. If it’s not telling you that adding glue will help the cheese stay on your pizza, it is producing art of eight fingered children or smoking monkeys.
Some people say it’s the future. Those people are wrong. The phrase “I asked ChatGPT where to buy a stamp” floats into my mind during quiet moments.
I tried to give ’The Waiting Room’ a chance. It’s Edinburgh Fringe. I want to experience experiments and risk taking. Creatives trying and sometimes failing. It’s so vital for immersive pieces to be developed and able to react and grow in response to audiences. But this is clinical. Cold. Am I supposed to be charmed that the robot can say my name?
There are previous AI based works I have enjoyed.“Saint Jude”, by Swamp Motel, made a delightful mix of interactive performance and communication with an artificial intelligence.
The show starts late. We hadn’t received the information we needed to bring headphones and smart phones. Then we can’t connect to the Internet in the venue. The AI generates stories slowly and the audience’s audio stories fall out of sync with each other. Being called up to get a note with a new task is not in sync with the AI telling us what to do.
We are in a Waiting Room to sell our digital avatar for use in adverts and political messages. Tasks are handed to us by a performer, wearing a paper mask for no explainable reason. “Write on the sticky note”, “take a selfie”. The AI has generated 24 mins of audio and “personal stories” based on my prompts.
Our audience is nervous, quiet. Long periods of silence.The performers seem unsure how to encourage us to interact. “Pick up a toy from a box and dance”. Why? What do I get out of this?
The purpose of a system is what it does. Immersive is beautiful in unique moments. This show isn’t a satirical look at a new form of art generation.
To paraphrase “I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.”
In the end the AI stated that my desire to be a marine biologist and my selling of beard oil made a “salty liquid for the face”.
Well.
Quite.

(It is worth noting that No Proscenium reviewed the online version of this work last year. But this was a chance to be in a real life space alongside the performers and live audience.)
Entering the hotel’s hall, containing a giant screen in the centre of the space, we are presented with a musician, to the side of a stage. This is ‘Non-Player Character’, a live musical taking place in virtual reality.
Performer and creator, Brendan Bradley (who played all the characters as well as singing throughout), welcomes us all and explains that, since the other company of performers hadn’t turned up, it was a chance to let our audience be involved in the show. I took the opportunity, so I am reporting my experience as a participant rather than an audience spectator.
Wearing Oculus headsets, I and three other audience members take on the avatars of colourful rock monsters. We have no legs and have blocky hands and faces. A giant grey being appears and mocks us for not doing anything. This is the Hero. He sings about how he is going to save the day, so we should watch. Then he is killed, leaving us alone with the Non Player Character. NPC falls into a deep depression now his friend is dead and we need to help him heal over the course of the musical.
A lot of the choices are made by the audience voting for the routes characters take as well as placing items into the space to interact with.
The VR, on the whole, held up. The NPC travels around the space and the songs echoed around us. NPC would ask questions and did a good job of handling the responses. A highlight was the green player who kept trying to get as close to NPC as possible.
Sometimes, it did just feel we were being dragged along by the narrative as we travelled from scene to scene. Sometimes we did the video game time fillers of trying to get stuck in holes, throwing rocks or just waving at each other. Which was quite wholesome.
Shows about grieving have become a common theme in this year’s Fringe. This was a wholesome and touching musical with impressive graphics and well performed live music and lyrics. For me, it was heightened by being able to participate in the action.

A new act asked me for advice on how to write their debut Edinburgh fringe show… I don’t think anyone knows how it’s supposed to be done, but I jotted down some notes, then turned it into this post in the hope it might help others.
I’m Ollie Horn, and you can see me live! Click here for my tour dates.
The reason you’re doing Edinburgh is you’ll get to do this show 25 times in a row. You can’t possibly leave with the same show you came with. So, all you really should be worried about is your first show of the run, which will be a preview anyway. So don’t feel too much pressure to arrive with something perfect; you’ll get there.
Spend less time worrying and more time writing and performing. Doing your first hour isn’t a big a deal as you think it is, and just as you’ve got a essentially no chance of taking this show to the festival and achieving life-changing fortune and industry adoration; you’re also probably unable to make any career-altering mistakes either.
But stop having self doubt.
First, even though it’s an open access festival, Edinburgh has just enough gatekeepers that with only very few exceptions, you’re unlikely to have been given a room at the festival if at least somebody who has some professional and reputational skin in the game didn’t think you’d be able to do it. There’s no inside and outside in comedy. Or, at least to the extent to which there is: you’re in!
Second, there is a reason why lots of people who have done perfectly well received hours at the festivals are unable to get themselves booked to do club 20s at the weekend stand-up clubs. It’s possible to entertain people for an hour in the context of a festival show without too much of a skillset. If you’re reading this thinking, “but I do have a skillset — I’m good at comedy!” then stop thinking that you can’t do an hour. You absolutely can.
Obviously do whatever you want, but I think there are two approaches, and having tried both, I don’t think it matters which you choose.
The first is to settle on a story, theme, or message first. For my first hour ‘Pig in Japan’, I wanted to tell the story of becoming a minor TV personality in Japan, and the bad experience I had on set that made me decide to quit. I already had the videos I wanted to play, and I vaguely knew how I wanted the audience to feel.
Once I had the north star, I then went about adding routines to see if any of them helped me with the narrative I wanted to write. Each preview I did I hot-swapped routines that I’d either done before, or had written especially, to see if I could hit a certain point or beat that the show needed.
For example, I knew that I wanted to make the point in the show that generally life in Japan as a non-Japanese person is abrasive and challenging, before I made the point that the TV industry takes this to a ridiculous level. I could make that point in a number of ways. In the end I settled on a routine about buying fried chicken, but it could have been anything.
So that’s the first way: think of the story that you want to tell, then write routines and jokes in support of that end goal.
The second way is the opposite of this — think of your hour as five ten-minute routines, and find a way to make those five bits flow.
The advantage of this method is you probably have three or four ten-minute routines that you’re proud of, and you know work well. Your job during previews is to stitch them together. Try doing both routines as a twenty minute set, and see if you can merge the two, creating an A-plot and B-plot, adding callbacks, and merging your world creation. Try taking lines and tags from one routine and wedging them into another that works by making a tangent, or a simile, or comparison.
Do the show enough and you’ll realise that there is a narrative through line that just exists by virtue of the fact that it’s you who wrote the routines, and you would have had your own subconscious motivations to write them in the first place; it’s likely that many of your routines betray a unique and interesting principle or heuristic that’s obvious to you, but potentially interesting to your audience.
Once you’ve settled on your roughly fifty minutes of material (I say this because you want your show to run about 55 minutes, and the best way to do that is to have fifty fantastic minutes that you perform with enough poise and credibility that the material has space to breathe), it’s time to work out what the show actually is.
One way to approach this is to ask yourself “how would I like my audience to recommend my show to a friend?” A less cynical way of thinking about this exact same question is to appreciate that the audience won’t remember any of your material, but they will remember how they felt after the performance. What do you want that feeling to be? Critically examine every routine and work out whether it’s in service of this goal. If it isn’t — get rid.
A good way to stress test routines is to take them back into clubs and open mics. Even while previewing a show I’ll book in as many new material nights as I can, and see if I can perform the routines I’ve written out of the context of the show. It’s a quick way to find out if the premises are independently enjoyable and intriguing.
If you’ve booked in enough previews, and you get the sense that the iterative leaps from one preview to the next are getting smaller and smaller, then do some radical things to shake things up. Start with your closing routine and see what happens. Start bending the truth to see if it makes for a better story (consider changing chronologies, merging characters (i.e. if you talk about Mr. A in one routine and Mr. B in another, just make them the same person), raising the stakes, etc). No doubt you’ll be audio recording all your performances, but take a video camera too and see how your physicality can be improved.
Don’t do a census at the start of the show. Where they came from, who they came with, and their professions don’t matter one dot. Don’t get all meta and talk about the process of writing the show or “so this is my first hour, and I wanted to talk to you about…”. Just thank them for coming and start with a really funny routine.
This is a joke, but the reason that the ‘dead dad show’, and its tell-tale structure of having a sad bit happen two thirds in is because you need to pace your show while thinking about your audience’s energy and attention levels. Even if they weren’t watching four other shows either side of yours, your audience won’t want you to perform with the same energy for the duration of the show. Start to feel and intuit the moments where you pull back, recalibrate, and go for another round. Like having sex, I presume.
I made this mistake with my first hour, until a reviewer pointed it out. In the last ten minutes of the show, the story I was telling felt like it was concluding, but I went off on a little tangent because I had a nice handful of jokes that I wanted top put somewhere, and they sort of fitted. The show didn’t need it, and was better when I just cut it. If you’re on the home straight, don’t deviate.
If you’re listening back to a recording and more than 20–30 seconds has passed without the audience laughing, then you should re-write. If you need to let the audience know that your mum is old for the sake of a routine about age differences, don’t just say “My mum is old — she’s 87. She’s the same age as my friend’s grandparents, which means…”. Instead, try turning that premise into a joke. “My mum is old. She’s of the generation that put decorative plates on the walls, like your grandparent’s parents did.” there we have the premise, plus character exposition, and a laugh.
This is a hard one to explain, and is something I’ve only recently started doing, so maybe it’s too much to ask for a first fringe hour, but vibe up there. Don’t feel the need to do precisely the same show every day. Be playful and responsive and reactive. It’s not the end of the world if Thursday’s audience gets a slightly different show to Friday’s audience because you had an intrusive thought that you shared with the crowd (with we can only presume hilarious consequences). Be present, and let your persona and personality drive the show. You’re not presenting your material; you’ve written your material to present you.
If you’re doing a free or pay what you want show, consider doing your bucket speech before your final routine not after so people aren’t listening to you doing admin and thinking about needing a wee and how far they are away from their next show etc while you’re doing the important job of getting them to pay for the show they just watched for free.
No matter how silly, ironic, subversive or cynical your on stage persona is, don’t be anything other than sincere and authentic for the bucket speech. Explain the recommended cost for the show, then invite the audience to “pay for the show”. Not donate to the show, or contribute to your expenses, or whatever other work-devaluing apology you may have.
Be brutal about cutting stuff. Even if it’s brilliant. It won’t be wasted effort, you’ll find a use for it some day.
Once you’re fairly sure you’ve got a show, then treat every single performance as a fresh start. Just like rolling a dice, the chances of you hitting a six today are entirely independent to what you achieved yesterday. Don’t worry if you forgot a bit, did an act out wrong, messed up a few lines. The audience have absolutely no idea what they’re supposed to be seeing, so have no way of knowing if today was a ‘good one’ or not.
Just take your job as custodians of their happiness for an hour seriously, and you’ll do great.
The final—and probably most important—thing to remember is there literally are no rules in Edinburgh. If you’ve read any part of this and thought “oh well I cant’ do that then” then just ignore whatever made you think that.
All that matters is your audience. Care deeply about them, over-deliver on whatever promise you’ve made to them, and do the festival on your own terms.

In the heart of Scotland, Edinburgh and Glasgow stand as contrasting siblings, each exuding their own brand of charisma. These cities are not just destinations; they are experiences, embroidered with history and buzzing with modern life.
Edinburgh — A Timeless Elegance Amidst a Dynamic Rhythm
Edinburgh, the capital, is a city of literary dreams and cobbled whispers. As you wander through its ancient lanes, the city feels like an open-air museum, each street a gallery, each building a testament to the past. The iconic Edinburgh Castle looms over the city like a guardian of history, while the Royal Mile stretches below, a procession route of heritage and tradition.
Yet, Edinburgh pulses with a youthful beat. The city’s historic heart flutters with the hustle of street performers, the clink of coffee cups, and the intellectual buzz of university life. There’s a juxtaposition here — the old-world charm of the Old Town, where every alleyway tells a story, against the New Town’s neoclassical grace, alive with chic boutiques and modern gastronomy.

Although my ancestry comes from Scotland, it was never that high on my travel list.
I’m not sure why — I guess other locations just sounded more exciting. So when my dad planned a trip for our family to explore Scotland, it sounded fun, but not like a place to cross off my bucket list.
That all changed when I got to the country.
Scotland was amazing; truly a place I could see myself living someday. I was shocked by how much I loved it — the people, the city, the country, the food, the atmosphere, everything.
We went all over, starting in Glasgow. That beautiful gothic city was quite the introduction to the country, but once we hopped on the train to head to our next destination, the Isle of Eriska on the western coast, we started to really see the beauty Scotland has to offer.
The Isle of Eriska was its own private island, complete with a unique, castle-style hotel, activities, and a spot to watch otters playing in the ocean at sunrise.
It was magical.
The rest of the trip was just as exciting, with multiple castle ruin tours, spending time on Loch Ness looking for the…

Photography Walks: Edinburgh, Scotland
Walk Two: A Picturebook of a Short Stay in Scotland’s capital
It started out as a treat for our 12 year old daughter. She wanted to see the pandas in Edinburgh Zoo which is 245 miles (395K) away! A fresh urgency to fulfilling this request was the forthcoming removal of the pandas back to China.
We decided that a couple of nights stay was required and set off early on day one. The delights of an Air B+B awaited us. We are non-smokers and chose a non-smoking flat. The previous visitors clearly had no regard for this and the flat stank. And in the second bedroom the broken blind was hidden in the wardrobe. Grrrr. Open windows, emergency window coverings, copious amounts of air freshener and complaints to the owner. Well, we’ll never stay there again! Air B+B has served us well over the years but not this time.
As well as the zoo and pandas our daughter’s idea of a good time is shopping for clothes. So after the zoo mum and daughter went shopping and I took the opportunity to wander with my camera and catch up with them here and there.
One thing we did together was to visit the Royal Yacht Britannia which is now a tourist attraction on Edinburgh’s docks. Retired…

I made a new friend by happenstance. Recently I accidentally destroyed an old, precious book of mine, and April Smith, owner of Booksmith Conservation, restores them for a living (beautifully, I might add). She also completed an archaeological dig at the Macedonia-Greece border in the 1990s (!!🤓) — one of the places I will expand my research to in the coming years. Plus, her job is so cool; I was friendly-jealous and mesmerized by the process of book preservation. She’s taking a trip to Scotland this summer, and I remembered that I have a list of spots and tips I curated a while back for friends visiting the Highlands and Edinburgh I haven’t shared here yet. I wrote this quickly, soon after my last trip there (pre-COVID), but I imagine many of the same general things still apply. So it’s a bit hodge-podge in style, structure, and content, but that’s because Scotland trips don’t really need to be planned — Scotland plans you.
Highlands Lodging:
One thing to keep in mind is that most bed and breakfasts in the Highlands are not yet online (weirdly) — so we thought Portree was all booked up before arriving, but you really can show up, and all the hundreds of B&Bs you pass will have either a “vacancy” sign or a “no vacancy” sign. It’s a nice system if you want to walk around a bit and meet the (very kind) owners, who are always willing to let you glance at the room and see if it’s charming enough to suit your needs before locking in the (very affordable) deal.
Basically, this is my way of saying don’t pre-book anything in the Highlands. Just follow your intuition and let yourself be guided by the lovely locals.
Highlands Info:
Oban is spectacular. It won’t be difficult, but be sure you catch the sunset there. It’s life changing. And if possible, have fish ‘n chips from a place that has fresh catches every day.
The Isle of Skye is also gorgeous —even if you have gray weather (like we did), it comes in spurts and doesn’t really rain that hard, so don’t let it keep you inside. Bring a billed rain jacket if you have one—it’s what everyone wears.
I don’t know where you’re planning to stay, but I strongly suggest having dinner in Portree at least once. There is such an impressive collection of high-end seafood restaurants concentrated there. We found a new one we recommend the highest — but I’m sure they are all good. There are several fish ‘n chips places, too — but I had the best fish ‘n chips I’ve ever had in the little take-it-to-go place in the center if Portree. You’ll notice it just by walking around for five minutes because Portree is small. They definitely have fresh fish every day, most often from only an hour ago. Add the salt and vinegar and order a side of any of the homemade sauces that you tend to like elsewhere (like tartar sauce or curry sauce).
If you want to do a tour of Talisker, you’ll have to book it in advance — our way of seeing the distilleries was actually to just go to the bar and order a flight. Talisker’s bar wasn’t finished yet, but if you’re interested in buying a bottle, they will give you a taste. Talisker is the famous one, though, so it's a bit touristy (still worth a stop!). I enjoyed the smaller distilleries better — they were friendlier and felt more Scottish.
In general, when driving, don’t be afraid to make unplanned stops along the way! We found several little hiking paths that were well-marked and let you choose via signposts “waterfall versus lair,” etc. all along the way. We also made an unplanned stop in the (very small) town of Sligachan on Skye where we could try any whisky our heart desired for very cheap. The town is basically a little rest stop close to Talisker, but worth spending some time in if you don’t get to do a tour of Talisker (we skipped it). In short, the Highlands are perfect for exploring.
I’m sure you will learn this when you arrive, but just to give you a taste of the mantra: “There are no trespassing laws in Scotland” — so you can literally walk anywhere, go through any gate, and explore wherever your heart desires. The farmers you meet encourage it — and seem to be proud of this aspect of Scotland. They will tell you if the bulls are out (and still, you can go through), but otherwise, they truly don’t mind you taking hikes through their incredible properties, which, together, make up Scotland. :)
Portree Restaurants:
I was told the best ones are №1 and Scorrybreac restaurants, but we didn’t book in advance, and in the summertime, they tend to be full, so we didn’t get to try them.
There are several restaurants nearby of a similar caliber, which we just walked past and begged for a reservation at dinner time (most were full).
We ended up trying Dulce and Brose with reservations one evening. It was overhyped but still tasty. We also tried another one by waiting in the bar area until they gave us a table — and it was so good that we added it to Google Maps and gave it its first 5-star review. It was seriously amazing. The name is Caroy House (it’s in cursive and super nondescript, so easy to miss, but worth finding!!). I recommend the smoked haddock risotto, the hake, the white wines they offer, and any of the desserts, really. It was spectacular. (Update from 2024: looks like it might be closed, thanks COVID).
Also, try the bakeries in Portree — and the little sandwich shops and savory pie places (anywhere, really, if you see a nice-looking pie).
EDINBURGH (EDI)
Italian:
1. For a very fancy night, you could try for a reservation at Locanda De Gusti (102 Dalry Rd). The food is top-notch homemade Italian; but it’s a small place so I’d guess that they are full already for the dates you’re there. Still worth a try!
2. For a very close second, make a reservation at a place Divino Enoteca (5 Merchant St). This place is large, so it almost always can fit you in for a same-night reservation, but it still has low, gorgeous lighting and punch-you-in-the-face, delicious food.
3. Finally, if you haven’t had a chance to try one of Jaimie Oliver’s restaurants elsewhere in the UK, it’s always a decent option. Jaimie’s Italian (54 George Street) is technically a chain, but it still serves pretty remarkable and creative Italian food. It’s a good lunch option if you’re staying nearby, but it's not worth trekking to.
Indian:
There is incredible Indian options all over Edinburgh, and I’m yet to try a bad one.. but these are the ones I’ve tried and would highly recommend. Regardless of whether you’re into spicy food or not, these places are a life experience:
1. Dishoom Edinburgh (3a St Andrew Square): This place started in London but has a few more now because of how perfect it is. Small plates, try-everything sort of style + delicious and seriously amazing cocktails. Matt and I decided to eat here twice in one week once, and I would have eaten there again. Tip — ask to eat downstairs if they will let you! The vibe of the bar seating is cooler (both metaphorically and literally) than the upstairs, which gets very hot in the summertime.
2. Tuk Tuk Indian Street Food: a hipster-style BYOB place that is quick, easy, and delicious.
3. Kamasutra Indo Tapas Restaurant (16 Drummond St) — this place is a little further out (and by further out, it’s like a 20 min. walk from George Street versus everything else), but that might turn out to be a good thing if other places are fully booked. It’s strikingly good and affordable too.
4. Ghurka Cafe (27 Cockburn St) is the first Indian place I discovered, so it has a very special place in my heart. I’ve taken every guest who visited me in Edi, and it was always a crowd pleaser. It’s a no frills kind of place (for instance, I think they only serve beer and average quality wine), but the flavors of the food are so good it will make you want to lick your plate clean (my not-so-new friend Mary’s son memorably did this). And it’s actually Nepalese so the dishes are really close to northern Indian dishes, very rich and pleasing. The location is super central and usually quite full, but somehow, they have always managed to fit me in without a reservation. (Still, make one if you can!)
Scottish:
1. Arcade Bar, Haggis & Whisky House (48 Cockburn St): This is a delicious lunch spot. For an easy entrance into the world of haggis, try the haggis nachos. If you are all-in, order the traditional style full plate haggis. Grab a dram of whisky here, too, if you’re feeling it — they have everything. The service is a little slow as they are often understaffed, but it’s such a pleasant atmosphere inside + perfect food that you won’t mind. :)
2. Fish n’ Chips: You’ll have plenty of opportunities for fresh fish n’ chips in the Highlands, so you might not want it in Edinburgh in lieu of other options, but if you do, my only advice is to get it from a small, low-key sort of place you notice somewhere that clearly gets fresh fish every day and not from a pub.
3. The Edinburgh Larder (15 Blackfriars St): simple but locally-sourced, delicious breakfast cafe/deli.
4. Oink (34 Victoria St): This place roasts an entire pig every day and makes these delicious (reasonably sized) sandwiches with various homemade toppings such as sweet potato mash, cranberry sauce, apple sauce, haggis, etc. It’s Matt’s favorite “snack” in Edinburgh.
5. Indigo Yard (7 Charlotte Ln): This place has delicious beers on tap and really impressive food. I guess it’s called a gastropub? The atmosphere is really nice — make a reservation if you can, and if you just show up, they might be able to squeeze you into the garden/bar area.
EDI Cocktails:
There is an underground cocktail place in Edinburgh called Panda & Sons — the outside looks like an old-style barber shop, but if the door’s not already open, just open it and go downstairs (Update: I later learned this is called a Speakeasy 😂) . I’ll let the rest be a surprise. It was recently rated in the top ten for good cocktails in Europe. Weekends can be really packed, but the cocktail will still be perfect every time, and the vibes are always great.
EDI Sweets:
Mary’s Milk Bar. I’m not big on sweets, and I initially thought I was just noticing this place because it has my name on it. But one day, I tried it, and now, I can confidently say it’s one of the few sweet places I would wait in line for — each flavor is a masterpiece! I saw only after I’d been that it made it onto Somebody Feed Phil’s Scotland episode. 💁‍♀️ (Thanks for recommending that show incidentally, sister Ellen!)
EDI Tourist spots:
1. The Castle: You can walk to see the entrance of the castle without paying the fee to get in ($18). It is worth it to go in if you have a free afternoon. It’s not a pop-in experience though. If you go, I would recommend touring half of it, taking a good long break in the cafe, and then touring the rest. There’s just so much to see; it’s all so remarkable; and it’s much more enjoyable at a leisurely pace.
2. Holyrood Palace: I’ve never been inside, but I have been told it is epic.
3. Royal Yacht Britannia: If you have an extra day, I would recommend this option highly. Especially if you are even vaguely swayed by the drama of the royal family (isn’t everyone when it gets right down to it?). If you’ve watched the Crown, book your tickets NOW. It is a big thing to get there if I remember correctly — I think we split a taxi?? — I don’t remember. But if you have the time, I definitely recommend it. If you’re days are limited, it’s not worth missing a day in EDI for though.
4. Calton Hill (at day or night) + graveyards + Arthur’s seat: This is my top recommendation for Edinburgh. Just put on some comfortable shoes and walk around Edinburgh.. follow windy stone streets.. especially the little alleys (which are called “closes”). Get lost. You’re allowed to follow any of the closes that catch your eye. Read about the history of closes if you’re interested. And if you think the history of closes is fascinating…
5. …take a guided tour of the famous, the real, Mary King’s Close. You’ll get the full history of the original design of the city and be able to see it underground, fully preserved from ancient times. (This is the only guided tour I’d recommend, but I’m not really that into guided tours.. I’m sure there are other great ones in Edinburgh, and probably even free ones with various themes.)
6. The Royal Mile: This could be absolutely packed with people in the summertime, so it may be hard to get perspective on the layout with the crowds, but it’s pretty remarkable to see nonetheless. Both amazing and average street performers congregate there, practicing for Fringe season, and there will be hundreds of free shows every day.
7. Live music will be abundant.
8. Grassmarket is a good neighborhood as well for seeing street performers and will be slightly less crowded than the touristy spots of EDI. I also like the Queen Street Gardens neighborhood. The museums close to Queen Street Gardens are both free and have a very impressive art collection.
9. Fringe: If you’re going in August, you will run into the chaos that is the Fringe Festival. Most people from EDI leave for the festival but if you brave it, but you should definitely get ahold of a Fringe magazine when you arrive, even just to see the enormity of the event. I find it pretty overwhelming, actually and ended up just choosing a few highly recommended shows — such as some of the acrobatic ones, comedy shows, burlesque, etc. and then leaving the rest of my time open for walking in and out of free shows. Basically, every single venue in Edinburgh will have a show of some sort. It’s fun for a day or two, but like Vegas, the feeling of awe wears off almost as quickly as it comes.
In general, I’d recommend visiting EDI literally any month besides August.
EDI Lodging:
I would suggest booking a place in EDI in advance — just to be sure you get to stay in a comfortable spot in the center.
My favorite place to stay is actually a hostel called Kickass Hostel. If you’re there with 2–3 people, ask to book a private room with a view of the castle. It’s really amazing — especially if you don’t mind a basic room and shared bathrooms (Update: I’m kind of past the point of sharing bathrooms). But either way, they have a comfy cafe where you can hang out and plan your EDI day.
Or not. Because plans, like the land, are made to be trespassed through in Scotland.

Final tips: take a few pics and write down some of the places you fall in love with unexpectedly (share with me) — and most of all, enjoy!

I stood shivering next to the sea at Wardie Bay, a huge grin plastered across my face. I had just done my first ever cold dip. My husband was looking at me bemused, surprised I had actually done it (we both know I’m more of a cup-of-tea-on-the-sofa type). I felt emotional, thinking about all the life we had squeezed into the past year and aware that our time in Edinburgh was coming to an end.
In April 2024 I moved from London to Edinburgh and now, just a little over a year later, I have moved back.
When I told people about this move their first question would often be ‘have you moved for work?’ To which I would reply ‘no, I moved for fun and work moved with me!’ Relocating to Edinburgh wasn’t driven by a job offer and it wasn’t a strategic career move. It was a move led by life.
Our tenancy agreement in London was coming to an end, we weren’t quite ready to buy and when it came to thinking about where to rent next I floated a question: ‘shall we leave London?’
We toyed with some more exotic options, but settled on the land of the deep fried mars bar and tattie scone. This was partly because I had visited Edinburgh before and always felt at home in the city. But it was also partly practical: it’s English-speaking, there was much more likelihood of us keeping our jobs, it’s not too far and it’s low risk because as a tenant you can hand in your notice and leave within 28-days (yes, really… Scotland does things better).
Both Jason (the husband) and I got the move signed off by work, bundled our possessions into the car and journeyed north.
Although lots of people have been delighted by our move, some have been a bit perplexed. Aside from the fact that we chose Scotland (why not Lisbon or Paris or somewhere… sunny?), and the fact we made the move knowing it would be temporary (why go to all that effort?), there was a third oddity tugging at people’s minds: why did we move if it wasn’t for work?
I find that last reaction particularly interesting, as it hints at a wider cultural phenomenon. Today, a large part of our identity is tied up in what we do for a living. Even that phrase ‘for a living’ doesn’t really make sense anymore — do we really just work for a living? Or do we work for a sense of self, the desire for fulfilment and, in some cases, the drive to attain a certain social status?
There is, of course, a mounting counter-movement that is pushing back against the way work is swallowing our lives whole, for example the rise of the four-day work week, or the increase in remote-working — which is expected to grow 25% by 2030. Demand for jobs with flexibility is on the rise, suggesting that more of us want to fit work around life, rather than the other way around.
As someone who has pivoted their career to the social/ environmental impact sector, it would be quite ironic if I thought that working for a bigger purpose was a bad thing. Of course I don’t. But I do believe that you can be career-motivated in general, and still seek out life experiences that have nothing to do with job prospects and may, even, negatively impact your career, albeit temporarily.
The important point is that it’s not a zero-sum game, it’s a pendulum swing. Sometimes work leads, sometimes it’s adventure and sometimes other responsibilities will take the limelight. (Or at least that’s how I think it should be).
We rented a flat in New Town, working from there most days, occasionally taking our laptops to nearby coffee shops. My arrangement with work was that I would come down to London once a month and spend two days in the office (the typical policy is two days a week in office). When I was in London it was chaotic and jam-packed, but when I returned to Edinburgh it was quiet and much more spontaneous (thanks to few social obligations).
Overall though, I would do it again in a heartbeat.
Not everyone has the ability to up and move — whether due to work, medical needs or the reality of family life, so understandably this is a privileged position to be in.
If you are in a position to prioritise an adventure — however big or small — here are some tips:
My time in Edinburgh isn’t a footnote, it’s a full chapter in my book of life. I still care deeply about my work, especially when it comes to using my working life to make a positive difference (however small), but I also care about living with intention.
And if you’ve made it this far, maybe you’re ready to do the same.
Why not try…
There’s more where that came from, so if you’re planning a trip don’t be afraid to ask for recommendations!

Edinburgh’s decline into a theme park has been charted for years, and the recent victory to Save the People’s Story stands out as an exception against a backdrop of relentless social cleansing, homelessness (the Scottish capital is home to the largest number of people living in temporary accommodation) and culture-washing.
The city’s problems are structural — it is a city of capital rather than a capital city. It’s purpose is hard-wired into its streets and architecture. As William McIlvanney writes in his novel Strange Loyalties, Edinburgh was:
“…built to be a Hanoverian clearing-house of the Scottish identity. The very street names declare what’s happening, like an announcement of government policy in stone: you have Princes Street and George Street and Queen Street with, in among them, Hanover Street and Rose Street and Thistle Street. Any way you count it, the result is the defeat of Scottishness. This was an identity superimposed on the capital of Scotland, an attempted psyche-transplant: ‘Scottishness may have been a life but Britishness can be a career.’
But if Edinburgh’s problems are historic, and symbolic, it is not helped by its current leadership. We know that Cammy Day was forced to resign from his job as leader of the Labour administration in the capital following allegations he had bombarded two Ukrainian refugees with multiple messages on social media. The councillor, who was suspended by his party last weekend, faces a police investigation into claims he acted “inappropriately”.

Liberal Arts Blog — Sunday is the Joy of Humor, Food, Travel, Practical Life Tips, and Miscellaneous Day
Today’s Topic: Scotland (Part One) A Little Geography, Five Battles, Edinburgh (including the Castle and the Fringe)
Last time, the fourth and final part of a series on the counties of Ireland. Today, on to Scotland, but first a re-cap.
On 2/23 we covered the Dublin of James Joyce and Leopold Bloom, Trinity College, the Ha’penny, Samuel Beckett, and O’Connell bridges, and St. Stephen’s Green, On 2/16 we investigated Northern Ireland including Belfast, the “Peace Walls,” the “Giant’s Causway” and Finn McCool. On 2/9, the central west (Galway, Mayo, Sligo) featuring the Aran jumper, Boycott, and Yeats. On 2/2 the southwest (Cork, Kerry, and Clare) and the stories of Daniel O’Connell (the emancipator of Catholics) and Michael Collins (independence leader who fought in the Easter Rebellion and was assassinated in an ambush at age 31 in 1922).
Now — the land of lochs and firths, of highlands, lowlands, and uplands, of the Shetlands, the Orkneys, and the inner and outer Hebrides, of Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen, of Robert Burns, William
Wallace, James Watt, James Clark Maxwell, Adam Smith, and Andrew Carnegie. And of the great clans — the MacKenzies, the Campbells, the Macleods, Stewarts, Douglases, Sinclairs, Macleans , Wallaces, MacGregors, Fergusons, and Gordons.
Are you Scottish? Have you been? Have you studied or lived there? What do you know about the northern third of island of Great Britain that the rest of us might not but would delight to learn?
Experts — please chime in. Correct, elaborate, elucidate.
GEOGRAPHY AND DEMOGRAPHY — note that firths are coastal inlets (like fjords) and lochs are lakes as in the famous story of the Loch Ness monster and the love song “Loch Lomond”
1. Scotland accounts for roughly a third of the island of Great Britain but has a population of only 5.5 million or about 8% of the United Kingdom. England: 56 million, Wales 3.2 million, Northern Ireland 1.9 million.
2. The border with England is only 92 miles long — as compared to its coastline of 6160 miles.
3. The North Channel separating Scotland from Northern Ireland is only 13 miles wide between the Mull of Kintyre in Scotland and Torr Head in Northern Ireland.
NB: 80% of Scotlands population is in the central lowlands which includes Glasgow (1 million) Edinburgh (half a million), Dunferline, Stirling, Perth, and Dundee.
FIVE HISTORIC BATTLES — Stirling Bridge (1297) Bannockburn (1314), Falkirk (1298), Folloden (1513), Culloden (1746)
1. Stirling Bridge (1297) William Wallace (1270–1305) and Andrew Moray (1265–1297) defeat English. Moray died of wounds from the battle. Wallace was later hanged, drawn, and quartered. Mel Gibson played Wallace in the film “Braveheart” (1995)
2. Bannockburn (1314) Robert Bruce defeats English leading ultimately to Scottish independence in 1328.
3. English victories against the Scots included: Falkirk (1298) Folloden (1513), and Culloden (1746).
The last English monarch to be killed in battle was James IV at the battle of Folloden. The Battle of Culloden ended the Jacobite rebellion which attempted to restore the Stuart monarchy. It was the last pitched battle on British land and resulted in mass evictions from ancestral lands, the banning of the tartan, and the disarming of the people.
EDINBURGH — THE CITY WITH A VOLCANIC PLUG IN THE MIDDLE UPON WHICH STANDS A CASTLE AND LEADING UP TO IT “THE ROYAL MILE” THROUGH THE “OLD TOWN” — have you been to the Edinburgh Fringe?
1. Edinburgh is bounded to the north side by the Firth of Forth and to the south side by the Pentland Hills.
2. “Recognized as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is the seat of the Scottish Government, the Scottish Parliament, the highest courts in Scotland, and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official residence of the monarch in Scotland.”
3. “The city has long been a centre of education, particularly in the fields of medicine, Scottish law, literature, philosophy, the sciences and engineering. The University of Edinburgh, founded in 1582 and now one of three in the city, is considered one of the best research institutions in the world. The financial center of Scotland, Edinburgh is the second-largest financial centre in the United Kingdom, the fourth largest in Europe, and the thirteenth largest internationally.”
NB: The Edinburgh Fringe is the “world’s largest performance arts festival which in 2024 spanned 25 days, sold more than 2.6 million tickets and featured more than 51, 446 scheduled performances of 3,746 different shows across 262 venues from 60 different countries. Of those shows, the largest section was comedy, representing 40% of shows, followed by theater, which was 26.6% of shows.” (see below)

It is Friday, the beginning of May, my usual morning to write my blog and I’m sitting in a hotel room in Edinburgh, Scotland. The sky is blue and cloudless and the air is a crispy 47°F.
My usual routine back home is placing my computer on the dining room table, quieting my mind and giving thanks while my Doodle Abbey rests at my feet. Today, I sit on a comfy bed with pen and paper. I asked for divine guidance and inspiration.
In response, I hear, “ You are beautiful.”
One of my favorite songs is “ Beautiful” by Gordon Lightfoot, a tune and lyrics that touch my heart. “You are so beautiful. I was made for you and you were made for me.”
Imagine God/Source/our Creator saying to you, my brother Bob, Marilyn, Ann, Alena, Paulette, Michael….all of us “You are beautiful.” Tears fill my eyes and joy fills my heart. Hear the words…. “ I was made for you and you were made for me.”
We are all the same energy made for each other, across continents across lifetimes and realities.
Hold that, feel it. Don’t let anything else in. You, your essence, your light, you, you are beautiful.
How does it feel to walk through your days as “ I am beautiful” versus “I am human, I am flawed, I have issues, blah, blah, blah.”
Try it, now, today, all day, all month. For the month of May, tell yourself I am beautiful.
Look for beauty, everywhere, every day in this month of May and write it down.
“Through rain or shine for such a long time. I’m telling you, you are beautiful.”
You’ve been beautiful since the day you were born and before.
It would mean so much to me if you would experience this. If you would close your eyes, take a deep breath, listen carefully and feel the powerful love given to you by three words “You are beautiful .”
With a smile on my face and joy in my heart, I am off to explore Edinburgh. Enjoy your Friday. Happy May!!

Update: the Principal Edinburgh Charlotte Square hotel is now the Kimpton Charlotte Square. Read the new review here.
With a castle view, a garden room indoors, and a gentleman’s travel collection on display, The Principal Edinburgh Charlotte Square is simply the most remarkable place to stay in New Town.
I blew into the hotel on a gusty early evening unprepared to be immediately charmed by this hotel. But charmed I was. The outside is grand while staying coyly understated. The Principal inhabits seven gorgeous Georgian townhouses and has been fastidiously refurbished with both expected and unexpected details.
Although I loved the masculine entry hall, I was distracted by the restaurant during check-in. Previously an outdoor courtyard, it is now an indoor garden room with a glass ceiling reminiscent of an atrium, draped in hanging ferns and styled with garden furniture. My husband and I enjoyed a full breakfast here both mornings of our stay and noticed happy chatting groups when we came in late in the evening. Another restaurant with a completely different vibe is tucked away at one end of the hotel. BABA serves food with an Eastern Mediterranean flair sprinkled with local staples, such as Scottish beef. At a contrast to The Garden, BABA is dipped in deep greens, reclaimed wood and wool rugs. Its moody evening feel is exciting, even before you see a menu.
Our tour of the room included a story — how Scottish! If The Principal was a person, he’d be Hamish, a gentleman with fine tastes who travels the world looking for the best of it. He’s collected books, textiles and trinkets which he displays on shelves for the pleasure of his guests. Just like the front desk staff, I picture Hamish as friendly and warm — as welcoming as this hotel.
As this was my first time staying at The Principal family of hotels, I was delighted with the complimentary sweets and savory snacks in the tuck box. The red corded telephone by the bedside was adorable as well, adding to the eclectic mix of old and new that works so flawlessly here. I was delighted to see that books are available to borrow from the front desk and hot tea is as easy to find as whisky. Some rooms have the best view in the country, a view of Edinburgh Castle. Even knowing this before I arrived, it was still breathtaking.
If you only have one day in this beguiling city, do these three things within walking distance of the hotel:
1. Visit the most besieged fortress in Great Britain, Edinburgh Castle. Try the Millionaire Shortbread in the café.
2. Tour the homes (now underground) of the average citizen during the time of the plague. I recommend The Real Mary King’s Close Underground Tour.
3. Eat at The Elephant House to absorb the ambience of the place where J.K. Rowling wrote much of the first Harry Potter book.
There’s only one place to stay in Edinburgh with such abundant charms and comforts, The Principal Edinburgh Charlotte Square. My thanks to Simon Willis and Tara D’Agostino for their kind assistance with this story.

One of the most striking features of Edinburgh is its weather, especially during the autumn and rain season. The misty rain often adds a sense of mystery to the old town, enhancing its fantasy-like appeal. Autumn in Edinburgh brings a palette of rich golds, browns, and reds, with the crisp air carrying the scent of fallen leaves and wet earth. The city’s vintage buildings…

Today I’m going to take you on a walking tour through old Edinburgh. This piece was originally written as a script for an armchair audio tour. It incorporates stories about historical figures like Mary, Queen of Scots, the body snatchers Burke and Hare, William Wallace and Robert the Bruce as well as tales of ghosts and witches, and a sprinkling of architecture. It is intended to be read out loud and listened to on a rainy afternoon by a roaring fire with a glass of single malt whisky to hand. Slàinte mhath!
Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland, is my hometown. It regularly makes the top ten lists of best places to live in the world and best cities to visit. In summer, because Edinburgh is so far north, you can enjoy about 18 hours of daylight. The Old Town is a World Heritage Site and stretches along a ridge from Castle Rock down to the Palace of Holyroodhouse.
Edinburgh is built on seven hills which provide a dramatic backdrop to the city’s skyline. These hills include Arthur’s Seat, an ancient volcano that provides panoramic views of the city and beyond, and Calton Hill, home to some of Edinburgh’s most iconic monuments.
Now, close your eyes, and take a deep breath. The weather today is cool, with a breeze that carries the fresh salty air from the nearby North Sea. Feel the damp, misty air on your face. Exhale and relax.

An Edinburgh Christmas Ghost Story — tales from the graveyards of the Necropolis of the North,https://medium.com/@DuncanHynd/an-edinburgh-christmas-ghost-story-tales-from-the-graveyards-of-the-necropolis-of-the-north-61a8d7150fb6,"Sign up

Our dead are never dead to us until we have forgotten them — George Eliot.
In the dark corners of the burial grounds of early 19th Century Edinburgh, the Necropolis of the North as I like to call it, two entrepreneurial men met a rapidly rising demand for human bodies to be used for anatomical dissection. Using human remains for medical research was illegal in the UK and banned in much of Europe or extremely limited for what were largely religious reasons.
To that end and to practice their surgical skills and enhance their anatomical knowledge doctors were only allowed to dissect bodies of executed criminals, people deceased in prison and oddly, orphans or people who had died with no fixed abode. As medical schools became more common, the supply and demand for dead bodies exceeded a state of economic equilibrium and so people resorted to body snatching or when that resource dried up, murder — to keep the cold medical school mortuary shelves and marble slabs well stocked.
Step forward William Burke and William Hare!
At the time Edinburgh was the leading European city for anatomical research and so the aptly named ‘resurrection men’ robbed fresh graves of their homo sapiens contents until relatives decided to take matters into their own hands and essentially lock the grave and coffin shut using what were termed ‘mort-safes’ of which some fine examples still exist in the infamous Greyfriars Kirkyard and others. These enclosed the grave, tomb or mausoleum in heavy duty wrought iron bars and locks, that even todays gangs that run around London with battery powered angle grinders to steal expensive bikes would struggle to cut open. The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh is still famed the world over as a leading surgical training today but by physically locking up the dead within their individual burial chamber, the supply of corpses rapidly dried up.
Out of interest, Surgeons’ Hall in Edinburgh, is the headquarters of the aforementioned Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and houses the Surgeons’ Hall Museum with anatomical displays and surgical equipment which is well worth a visit when you’re in town. There is also a library and archive of the colleges work.
The present Surgeons’ Hall was designed by Edinburgh’s leading light architect William Henry Playfair and completed in 1832, and is a category A listed structure while Playfair will feature in my tales of Edinburgh graveyards shortly and so please don’t change channels just yet!
The museum is recognised as a collection of national significance by the Scottish Government and very popular with tourists and locals alike.
Measures to ensure graves were left undisturbed, such as the use of mort-safes (I did research deadlock and mortice lock for this piece but there is no evidence that the etymological beginning of these names are at all linked to the subject matter but they sound like they should be) only made the shortage of cadavers even worse and so the indigenous vagrant population quickly became lambs to the slaughter and all for a princely sum of around £7 which would be worth around £1,000 today and so not to be ‘sniffed’ at.
When the New Calton Burial Ground was built as an overspill and operational replacement to the Old Calton Burial Ground just half a mile to its east on Regent Road due to Waterloo Place being built, a special watchtower was built, specifically to stop people grave robbing, such was the commercial opportunity on offer!
The murders started after a tenant in one of Hare’s properties died suddenly and the pair sold the body to Dr Robert Knox who was a celebrated lecturer of anatomy and a zoologist, ethnologist and medical doctor in the city and who had established the above-mentioned museum of anatomy and pathology. Another lodger, suffering from a cold was killed for literally sniffing too much and putting off other potential tenants from renting rooms and so the murders continued with the tacit approval of Burkes wife and Hare’s partner and no doubt partly to support their increasingly extravagant and expensive lifestyle. They were caught when the body of Margaret Docherty was discovered who was suspected to have been suffocated but at that time, no one could prove this.
Hare was granted immunity from prosecution and so by way of the use of Kings evidence he provided the details of Docherty’s murder and confessed to all sixteen deaths colloquially known then as the West Port Murders while charges were laid against Burke and his wife for three of the deaths.
At trial Burke was found guilty of just one murder and sentenced to death. The case against his wife was found not proven. Burke was hanged shortly afterwards and his cadaver was dissected and his skeleton displayed at the anatomical museum of the Edinburgh Medical School.
Robert Knox was never charged with his connection to the murders despite public outcry but his reputation in Edinburgh was irreparably damaged and so in time the Royal College of Surgeons forced him to resign as the curator of their anatomical museum.
The Burke and Hare case hugely raised public awareness of the need for cadavers for medical research and contributed to the passing of the Anatomy Act of 1832 that gave surgeons and students legal access to bodies from workhouses, hospitals and prisons that were unclaimed 48 hours after death. It was also made possible for a person to donate a next of kin’s body for medical research. It was essentially ratified in response to public outrage at the illegal trade in corpses.
The Arthur’s Seat 17 small coffins discovery
Robert Louis Stevenson died in 1894 and is buried on Mount Vaea, its summit overlooking Apia, the capital of Samoa. Many years before he died, he composed his own epitaph — ‘Under the wide and starry sky, Dig the grave and let me lie. Glad did I live and gladly die, and I laid me down with a will’.
Stevenson, as we know was a world-renowned Scottish novelist and is best known for Treasure Island, The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Kidnapped among many other books, poems, essays and travel guides. The son of Thomas Stevenson and grandson of Robert, a family famed for building lighthouses and other civil engineering feats suggested that he acquired his love of writing from his mother’s side of the family, the Balfours. His alma mater was Edinburgh University and while his paternal family were reticent about him taking on a life as a wordsmith and not an engineer, the rest as they say is history aside from the equally ‘strange case’ of 17 tiny coffins.
In June 1836, a group of boys were rabbiting on Arthur’s Seat, when they came across a small cave on the North East side, its entry covered by a stone and inside they found 17 miniature wooden coffins along with some tiny, carved figures clothed in delicate but bespoke outfits. These are now on show at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.
It has been mooted many times that these coffins are in some way a memorial to the 16 victims of Burke and Hare and as Burke was hanged in 1829 that made 17 deaths and indeed 17 coffins, others suggest they’re linked to some form of witchcraft.
However, in 2014, the museum was sent a package containing another small coffin with a small body with an accompanying note containing a long quote from Robert Louis Stevenson’s work — The Body Snatchers, which was part inspired by the Burke and Hare murders. Spooky indeed!
Greyfriars Bobby and the ghostly kirkyard.
There is no doubt that the most ‘popular’ graveyard in the Auld Reekie is at Greyfriars Kirk and probably because of a certain pet dog and not a famous human being although being what some term ‘the most haunted place in Edinburgh’ does get the tourists flooding in and it’s all for free as our all the main galleries and museums in this great, but increasingly ‘Disneyfied’ city.
The existing church on the site was built in 1602, and people have been buried here before then, including James Hutton, who famously stated that ‘we find no vestige of a beginning — no prospect of an ending’ and was part of Edinburgh’s period of ‘Enlightenment’. He realised that the earth was far older than current religious beliefs of the time allowed for and spoke out about this despite having to defer to the status quo and John Porteous, who was the drill master of Edinburgh’s city guard. When an infamous smuggler was hung in 1736, people rioted and he was given an order to shoot over them but as things worsened, he asked the soldiers to fire on the mob, killing many. He was charged, imprisoned at the Tollbooth, captured by the angry throng and then lynched, ending up buried at Greyfriars a day later. You can read more about this in my blog that features ‘Heart of Midlothian’ by Walter Scott which features this historic event and local football team the Jam Tarts and also my boyhood heroes Spurs.
From Waverley to White Hart Lane:
https://medium.com/@DuncanHynd/from-waverley-to-white-hart-lane-d083327faa2b
Rumour has it that it could be the most haunted graveyard in the world and is named after a Franciscan Friary located on the site but no longer stands there and aside from the above famous people interred also contains the burial places of some grave robbers too.
One angry, even violent apparition that has been allegedly seen and heard by late night revellers, legend has it is a certain George MacKenzie who was a tormentor of a religious group of 17th-century Presbyterians. Apparently, his ghostly form was freed when a tramp broke into his tomb and he has been on the rampage ever since.
Another often mentioned Greyfriars spectre is that of Edinburgh surgeon James Borthwick who died in 1675 and who bizarrely by today’s standards was the initial teacher of anatomy in a special society of barbers and surgeons! I guess this makes sense as both used sharp instruments to either shave people or operate on them or both if they wanted them dead and likely where the name cut throat razor came from!
A member of the Scottish Parliament, Borthwick was responsible for the creation of the ‘Surgeon-Apothecary’ group in Edinburgh as he served his internship as what would be a modern day pharmacist initially and was then incorporated as a surgeon unusually without first having served a surgical apprenticeship but as the city had been gripped by the plague, membership levels where very low. His speciality was as an anatomy teacher to student surgeons when human dissection was a much needed but often dark art.
By way of an Edinburgh council remit in 1657, the Surgeon- Apothecary group were granted permission to work on patients as until then the surgeons and apothecaries had completely different areas of practice.
Borthwick died in 1676 and is buried in this infamous grave yard, his monument adorned with a life size, crazy, dancing skeleton carrying a scythe in the style of Father Time, a royal crown and the skull and cross bones, with an array of surgical devices displayed on the sides!
James Hutton the geologist mentioned above is buried in desecrated land that was once the ‘Covenantor’s Prison’ that held circa 1,200 prisoners in around 1679, people who were so called militant Presbyterians and believed in what was known as the National Covenant and whom George MacKenzie, representing the Crown but in his human form, persecuted. Some simply died in the grounds, some were executed for treason, some escaped, and some were freed after signing a bond of loyalty to the Crown and shipped via the Port O’Leith to the US.
If you like Harry Potter, Tom Riddell’s villainous monument is located here too.
The graveyard is famously, from a tourist’s perspective, forever associated with the legend of Greyfriars Bobby, a dog who guarded his dead owner’s grave for 14 years and who has a burial headstone at the entrance. There is a statue and water fountain of Bobby, whose brass nose is now very worn out at the corner of Edinburgh’s Candlemaker Row and George IV Bridge and ridiculously popular for selfies as shown above.
Depending on the narrative you believe, and there are quite a few the dog was either a Skye Terrier or a Dandie Dinmont, who died on 14 January 1872. The best-known variation is that Bobby belonged to John Gray, who worked for the Edinburgh City Police as a night-watchman, with Bobby his formal watch-dog. Gray, under other popular pseudonyms was a farmer, a gardener or other!
Lastly, the churchyard has claimed the burial of other historic figures such as Scottish architect William Adam, its first famous post humous occupant how famously designed Hopetoun House near Edinburgh and Duff House, very close to where I live out the spring and summer months in Banff on the Moray Firth to William Wright, who was a Scottish physician, botanist, infamously part of the slave trade and joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
The leading architect of Edinburgh’s iconic buildings and graves gave his named to a popular pub too!
William Henry Playfair who infamously has a Wetherspoons pub named after him on Piccardy Place by the Vue cinema complex as a posthumous badge of honour was both a leading designer of landmark buildings and largely big-statement and non-conformist tombs in the Auld Reekie, mainly found in the remarkable Dean Cemetery, located high above the Water of Leith and the tourist hotspot that is Dean Village.
Born in 1790, Playfair died in 1857 and is buried in the same grave yard where some of his best work can be seen such as his pink pyramid tomb that inters Lady Sophia Rutherford and her husband Andrew Rutherford who was, among other illustrious jobs, the Lord Advocate of Scotland. His wife, Sophia Stewart died in 1852 where after Playfair built one of the most amazing memorials I have ever seen. The photograph below shows this and is in a line of tombs aptly named The Lord’s Row! His own memorial and the one to Lord Jeffrey are also worth a visit too. Francis Jeffrey qualified as a lawyer and was one of the co-founders of the influential magazine, the Edinburgh Review. He was editor, then became a politician and also the Lord Advocate.
His links to Burke and Hare are tenuous at best but it was he that designed the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh building where the surgeon Robert Knox worked and where he purchased the bodies.
He also was the architect behind the National Gallery of Scotland, the Old College at the University of Edinburgh and the Royal Scottish Academy along with what was termed the east or third New Town and many other Edinburgh neoclassical land marks. The old, steep steps that lead from the top of the Mound, down to the National Gallery are called the ‘Playfair Steps’ in his honour.
Born in London, his father was also an architect and shortly after his death he was sent to Edinburgh to be educated by his uncle John Playfair, usefully a famous mathematician. His alma mater was the University of Edinburgh and after graduating he joined the team of celebrated architect William Stark and eventually joined the Freemasons.
William Playfair died in Edinburgh in 1857, and is also buried in the Lord’s Row on the western edge where he designed monuments for others as shown above.
Since his death and completed in 2004 ‘The Playfair Project’ joined by tunnel the two separate buildings making up the National Galleries and then most recently the southern building has undergone an amazing £38m transformation, with a huge new subterranean section built into the Mound and exiting onto Princes Street gardens with stunning views over Waverley and the old Nor Loch that showcases the very best of Scottish art, with Landseer’s Monarch of the Glen holding court in its new resting place on a huge wall at the end the new building.
While walking around Dean Cemetery recently, located high above Dean Village, sited on the banks of the Water of Leith, I came across the grave of Edinburgh artist John Bellany, noted for his almost impressionist or expressionist, stylised portrait paintings of Scottish icons such as Billy Connolly and Sean Connery, created in the early 90s. Connolly’s portrait called ‘The Entertainer’ is currently not on display but the one of Connery is still exhibited in the National Portrait Gallery today. Once you have seen a Bellany image, you will instantly always know when you see one again.
On the subject of Connolly and Connery, aside from being famous Scottish thespians and having portraits painted by Bellany, at a BAFTA ceremony in 1999, Billy was due to present Sean with a life time achievement award but couldn’t make the event and so over a live TV link from the US said to all the guests present and Connery and his wife ‘You’ve done awfully well for a man with a speech defect’ and ended ‘congratulations baldy, I wish I had your money!’. Praise indeed. Connery died in 2020 and the whole of Scotland will be in mourning when Connolly meets his maker and would pay good money to hear what he says to him.
Bellany was born in Port Seaton in Edinburgh and much of his work has the sea as a main theme which often diverges into his own psyche or human form. Other well-known images merge human and animal forms, often painted in an overtly menacing style, However, his portraits of well-known people such as Connolly, Connery and Ian Botham are the most recognisable for me especially with regards to the colour palette used. His painting style calmed down when he was diagnosed with cancer later in life and he died in 2013 aged 71. When in Edinburgh, it’s well worth looking out for his unique, contemporary works.
Sean Connery’s ashes were scattered in St Andrews.
Below are the two paintings in question and my own photographs from the Edinburgh galleries when they were on show and exhibited to the public.
Beware the Weeping Angels
The Seafield cemetery in Edinburgh, located beside the now defunct Restalrig Railway, a cycle trail and footpath between Leith and the long sandy beach at Portobello is well worth a walk around. Some of the memorials are seemingly straight out of a series of Dr Who.
For lifelong fans like me, the ‘Weeping Angels’ were really scary, ghost like alien creatures in the form of an angel who were introduced in 2007 and that if you blinked, the angel would be able to very rapidly move much closer to you and the end game being that if they can reach out and touch you then you’re sent back in time to a life of purgatory. They are unable to move while being watched by anyone living, including oddly themselves and are turned to stone when an eye is glanced upon them and so the angel below is quite a good representation, especially on a cold, dark day! When stone like, they cannot be harmed.
The then writer and creator Steven Moffat reckons that they are the most popular and frightening foe of the Doctor in that any stone statue could be one, but he would say that wouldn’t he. For me the Daleks and Cybermen will never be bettered but I am over sixty now!
They do really resemble female stone statues in the form of winged angels with draped robes that you might find in a Victorian graveyard like Seafield. However, as they move in closer to you they show off vampire like teeth and clawed fingers and in some episode they even had ‘babies’ that resembled demonic cherubs that laughed and made rather loud footsteps!
Weeping Angels can’t look at each other nor in a mirror and so shield their eyes to avoid paralysis, which is where they get their name from as it looks like they’re weeping but have the ability to send you back in time to an age when you didn’t exist or will ever exist. The resulting forces from this is their life blood.
There are many more nuances but we’ll leave that there!
The Scottish Enlightenment, in a very brief nutshell!
An amalgamation of free minds, ideas and publications was centred in particular in Edinburgh and also over Scotland generally during the second half of the 18th century and for decades prior to and after that. It was a movement of ideas and the debate of those ideas and in philosophy, the two men most prominent were David Hume and Adam Smith.
Edinburgh was then described as hotbed of genius while Voltaire wrote in 1762 rather contentiously that ‘today it is from Scotland that we get rules of taste in all the arts, from epic poetry to gardening’.
David Hume, a leading light in the movement was a philosopher, historian and economist who was best known for his influential beliefs in ‘empiricism, philosophical skepticism and metaphysical naturalism’ which is a view which holds that there is nothing but natural elements, principles, and relations of the type studied by the natural sciences and denies the existence of a transcendent God. Philosophical skepticism is an important form of scepticism in that it rejects knowledge claims that seem certain from the perspective of common sense.
Empiricism is the theory that all knowledge is based on experience derived from the senses and created by those who doubted the possibility of acquiring any knowledge beyond that of the contents of directly felt experience. He believed that ethics were based on emotion and sentiment rather than one’s moral compass.
His mantra that making lives better by finding differentiation between morality, religion, ethics, and society was critical to his ideas but hugely controversial for the time. Hume held that passions rather than reason rule the human psyche saying that ‘Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions’.
His philosophy of religion, as with Hutton’s view on Geology included a rejection of miracles and the existence of a creator God, were especially controversial for their time and where being outspoken on such issues was sometimes dangerous and considered blasphemous, something we need to be careful not to repeat today.
His most famous line was that: ‘The life of man is of no greater importance to the universe than that of an oyster’.
Adam Smith was a social philosopher and a political economist while David Hume and Smith were very close friends.
Smith famously said that ‘Labour was the first price, the original purchase-money that was paid for all things. It was not by gold or by silver, but by labour, that all wealth of the world was originally purchased.’
He believed that wealth is created by hard work and self-interest. Smith’s suggestions that economies that are based on free markets, competition and capitalism are still the bedrock of economics and growth today.
As the self-styled father of economics, he wrote the book ‘Wealth of Nations’ and also suggested that ‘Goods can serve many other purposes besides purchasing money, but money can serve no other purpose besides purchasing goods. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from regard to their own interest’.
Hume died in 1776 and Smith in 1790
Hume is interred at the Old Calton Hill burial ground, just off Waterloo Place in a round, tower like tomb as shown above with a locked gate to keep out the grave robbers while Smith’s body lies in the Canongate Kirkyard close to Holyrood and he has a statue on the Royal Mile.
And finally, Sir Henry Raeburn Scotland’s finest painter…arguably
Raeburn was born Stockbridge, just north of the city centre of Edinburgh and is depending whom you talk to is arguably the best known of all Scottish painters and is buried in St Cuthbert’s churchyard, located at the west end of Princes Street and across the road from the Caledonian Hotel. His formal portraits are instantly recognisable, with legends such as Sir Walter Scott, part of his prolific portfolio, just pay a visit to the National Portrait Gallery on Queen Street to find out!
He actually commissioned and installed his monument and grave at St Cuthbert’s well before he died in 1823, hence including him in my story.
However, perhaps the most famous painting accredited to him and I say that advisedly, may well not be by him at all and is not really a recognised portrait either.
The Reverend Dr Robert Walker skating on Duddingston Loch or colloquially known as ‘The Skating Minister’ was acquired by the National Galleries of Scotland in 1949 for a song and is one of their most popular paintings both to view and as part of its merchandise offering and so they are not going to give up on its provenance despite many believing that Henri-Pierre Danloux, a French immigrant who was based in Scotland at the time, was the painter. Some say that Raeburn simply painted the face and not the majestic motions of the holy man on the ice.
In Michelle Sloan’s great book ‘The Edinburgh Skating Club’ she takes a ‘novel’ approach to the painting’s narrative where her main character Alison Cockburn, who was employed and friends with the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume whom we’ve met above, colludes with his sister, Katherine Hume to live as a man so as to become a member of the prestigious and men only club.
In a coincidental nod to the toxicity of gender reform politics in Scotland these days whereby it was stated that you could self-certify as a woman after a few months of simply deciding to be one, this makes for a remarkably contemporary novel but one full of local historic Edinburgh landmarks, characters and times past.
The background story is set in modern times and catalogues an art historian’s efforts to attribute the work to Danloux and ‘out’ the outlandish fact that Rev Walker might just have been a woman about to win a very big, life changing bet! It’s a great read and a good whodunnit.
Raeburn at the age of 28 moved to London where he met and was hugely inspired by portraitist Joshua Reynolds returning to Edinburgh in 1787 where he started to paint portraits of the Auld Reekie’s rich and famous and was hugely sought after and successful despite being largely self-taught.
He was knighted in 1822 just a year before he died and shortly thereafter was appointed His Majesty’s Limner for Scotland. A limner is an illuminator of manuscripts, or more generally, a painter of ornamental decoration.
Raeburn was especially well known in Scotland as the outstanding portrait painter of members of the Scottish Enlightenment and probably painted in excess of 225 acknowledged pieces.
When the Leith based shipping business, Henry Raeburn and Company, collapsed at the end of 1807, he was declared bankrupt and was left to paint portraits and act as a property developer to pay off creditors for the rest of his life.
His painting of Walter Scott in 1822 was one of Raeburn’s undoubted highlights, someone who also was left bankrupt by a series of poor business decisions and overspending. Later in life he chased warmer weather in Italy by way of a lift on a UK naval frigate but suffered a stroke on his way home, he died in 1832 at Abbotsford, where he is buried. The portrait shows Scott deep in thought at the height of his writing career.
Raeburn’s self-portrait was designed to project himself as the premier painter in the land especially to his peers down in London and painted this as his diploma picture for entry into London’s Royal Academy. He painted in York Place in a New Town house that had large north facing windows and special shutters to create the ultimate conditions for is work. He never made it back to London to paint and died in 1823 and is buried in his chosen resting place at St Cuthbert’s kirkyard at the very west end of Princes Street gardens.
I ain’t afraid of no ghosts — The Ghostbusters song
For me, I’m a great proponent of the new assisted dying law and hope that it becomes part of the statute soon, just as a back stop for those so ill, they can’t bear it any longer. I’ll have a ‘pure cremation’, whereby without any fuss, they take me away in a black bin bag, return me in an urn and I get chucked out into the Moray Firth!
If it was mandatory to have an epitaph I would go for Clement Freud’s idea when he said before he died…it will simply bear my name, and then the date of my death beneath the words ‘best before’.
I don’t believe in ghosts but I wouldn’t want to spend a night alone in Greyfriars, it is a cold, dark and scary place but if graveyards are your thing, the Necropolis of the North or the Auld Reekie is well worth a visit.
I prefer the Cullen Pet cemetery near my home in Moray where I find the messages of love for lost pets far more moving and relevant to me, however in the past stupid EU rules closed it down, but after Brexit, people can once again bury pets themselves and say whatever they like about them.
Go see!

When arriving in Edinburgh, Scotland, I had little to no expectations for this trip. With finals being so close to leaving, I didn’t feel I had the time to research these places. I thought the city was beautiful, as I’ve never seen anything like it before. The architecture was amazing, I have never seen so many Gothic buildings. My time here left me with so many beautiful photos. Something I didn’t expect to see here though, was little to no local people! I had no clue that most people who live here are not from the area.
After experiencing the beautiful city of Edinburgh, Scotland, I fully expected Dublin, Ireland, to be very similar. Instead, Dublin was so vivid when I arrived, the city felt more alive than Edinburgh. When comparing them, I would say Edinburgh is like a small tourist town. While Dublin has the tourist town feeling with all of the gift shops, there is so much more to it! I noticed just walking the streets of Dublin I saw so many restaurants and shops I wanted to go back to. The area we went to in Scotland felt almost too geared towards tourists, as a majority of the stores there had the exact same items.
In Dublin, I saw more attractions, retail stores, and restaurants in between…

Many years ago, I became the proud supervisor of not one, not two, but THREE PhD students and a part-time research assistant. Hurray me — I had a lab!
Now, clearly the word “lab” conjures images of test tubes and centrifuges, pipettes and petri dishes. Our research group has none of these things. But over time, the group of people associated with a given principal investigator (like me) and their shared resources (in our case, bubble guns and laptops rather than beakers and lab coats) has come to be known as a lab in a lot of scientific disciplines.
For us, the concept of the lab means a group of people who take an interest in each other’s work, help each other out when we’re stuck, and share ideas, resources and office space. We have a Code of Conduct to help set clear expectations for members of the group, and meet monthly to swap our latest news. Twice a year we have a half-day away day, sometimes focused on professional development and sometimes on just hanging out and having fun. Last autumn we had a session on writing a thesis and preparing for viva, but the most recent one included a foraging walk and then board games in a cafe!
My first challenge when deciding that my little team qualified as a lab group, was to come up with a name. I went to the pub with my husband and wrote down a series of keywords that described the work we were doing, and then saw which of these could be combined into a satisfactory and pronounceable acronym. And lo! DART was born — standing for development, autism, research, technology. Of course, I could have gone down the well-trodden path of the “Fletcher-Watson Lab” but honestly… *shudders*
Fast forward almost a decade and DART no longer seems like a suitable name for our little gang. “Research” has always bothered me as a keyword — I mean, obviously, we are researchers. “Autism” feels too narrow for what we do nowadays, which has a much broader focus on developmental diversity and trying to do work which is relevant and useful for multiple diagnosed and undiagnosed people. And it’s been a few years since I last did a project I could call “technology”.
So back to the drawing board, but roughly the same technique… Collectively we suggested words and — in a stroke of luck — this time we managed to organise them into an acronym that works for our largely-psychological research: MIND for mental health, interaction, neurodiversity, development. MIND though — there’s an awful lot of organisations out there with MIND as a name. That didn’t seem a good idea on its own, so Edinburgh MIND then?? Or maybe, there’s a chance to be clever and insert one more keyword into it all…
And so, the Edinburgh Inclusive MIND lab it is, or EdInMIND for short.
Nowadays this group has a rolling cast of about 10–16 members, as grant funding waxes and wanes. It is co-led by me and my close colleague, Catherine Crompton. While Catherine and I are both part of the Salvesen Mindroom Research Centre, our lab group is diverse and spans multiple parts of the University of Edinburgh — members may have a primary affiliation in the Division of Psychiatry, School of Philosophy Psychology and Language Sciences, Child Life and Health, Centre for Reproductive Health or Moray House School of Education and Sport. This diversity of perspective is one reason why we feel it’s important to have a lab identity which reflects our shared focus.
If you want to find out more about what we’re up to, the best gateway will be on this page where we link out to more specific projects and information — and back here, if you fancy going in a circle!

When I stepped foot in Edinburgh a few decades ago, I immediately fell in love with the place. That first sight of the city will never leave me, and I still adore how it holds its head high. Along with being beautiful, it is a highly educated and cultured city and has more graduates as a percentage than virtually any other place on the planet. It also hosts world-class innovation and research. While its infrastructure is never at a scale that the mighty London can achieve in terms of innovation, it is livable, walkable, and a fairly safe place to live.
In the city, I feel the ghosts of the past and of the great scientists, academics, business leaders and engineers who helped build the city and the country. This city, a few hundred years ago, showed the world how to take an enlightened approach to science and knowledge creation. In my university, too, I get to walk through John Napier’s Tower, and have the chance to convert his logarithms into something that provides the core of the security of the Internet — discrete logarithms.
And, for my PhD, I studied the work of James Clerk-Maxwell, and who’s created a unified theory for electromagnetic waves.
And, so, today, I am honoured to be elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE) [here], and share a space with those who have truly advanced Scotland as a country. As you should possibly know, Scotland has a long track record for punching above its weight in terms of invention and enterprise. Current fellows include many great scientists and engineers who have made Scotland their home, such as Peter Higgs and Jocelyn Bell Burnell. Former fellows include James Clerk-Maxwell and James Watt, along with the inventor of the TV:
And I love the entry for Benjmin Franklin, ad who is “interested in Electricity”:
But, for me, the mightiest of all, and possibly one of the greatest scientists of all time is James-Clerk Maxwell:
As you can see he was born in Edinburgh, and studied at the Edinburgh Academy and at the University of Edinburgh. After he graduated, he became a Professor at Aberdeen University, and then onto Kings College and Cambridge.
Education has given me everything in my career. For those starting out in their career, my core advice is to advance your education as much as you can, and achieve your full potential. No matter your background, if you have a desire to succeed, you will in the end. In fact, never stop learning, and advance yourself every single day. And don’t just learn from a superficial point-of-view; dive in and learn things deeply. If you can, read up on the classic research paper that built your field and understand the current barriers that need to be broken down. Research is great fun and can have a great impact … so go make a dent in this world (Steve Jobs quote). So, go do that MSc or PhD that you have always wanted to do.
This city and this country have given me everything that I would ever want in my career. They have helped shape our research and teaching, and they have been there to support us in building up collaborations, in supporting partnerships, and in allowing us the space to grow. To share a space that James-Clerk Maxwell once occupied is a privilege I will never forget. I am so lucky, too, as I get to research and teach the subjects that I love (cryptography and cybersecurity) and teach students who will build our future.

Or what the world’s biggest arts festival taught Leith planner, Claire Wood, about how to be better at her job.
Every August, Edinburgh hosts the biggest arts festival in the world. This year’s Fringe boasted over 55,000 performances of over 3,500 shows. Interestingly, it featured more shows about ‘social issues’ than previous years.
As someone who works for an ad agency and so spends a good portion of her time thinking about social issues and how advertising can persuade people to change harmful habits, I was curious to explore whether you can do the same with theatre. After all, the shortest show I saw this year lasted less than eight minutes. And even eight minutes gives you a better crack at encouraging people to change than a 30 second ad.
Of course, the context is different. Usually (though the Royal Mile in the Fringe is an exception), you actively choose a piece of theatre where you might bump into advertising content. And you usually plump for a particular production because some aspect of it appeals — the creative team, the topic, the actors. Few people actively seek out advertising as a reflection of their world view. (Is last week’s Nike campaign an honourable exception? Discuss.)
But assuming both do their jobs right, whether advertiser or theatre maker, both are creating content that they hope their audience will want to discover. So can we learn anything from theatre makers about how best to persuade people to change their ways? I think so — as follows:
Sometimes, the reasons you might want to behave differently are obvious. Most people now accept that it’s good to wear seatbelts when you’re driving and it’s bad to smoke, for example. But often, in order to persuade people to consider change — or disrupting a pattern — it helps if they understand the context, or the reasons why change is good.
Closed Doors was a quick-witted feisty piece of theatre by Glasgow performance poet, Belle Jones in collaboration with Novasound. Following a Police evacuation of a Glasgow tenement, three women from very different backgrounds are forced to confront the assumptions they’ve made about each other. Topical in these times of terrorist threats, firebombs and foiled plots, Jones’ message — that we should judge less and talk to each other more — is beautifully delivered.
From one woman’s story to another. Earlier this year, the Scottish Government passed a bill that recognised that domestic abuse isn’t only physical; it can also be psychological. ‘Coercive control’ will soon be easier to prosecute though the law will rely on victims coming forward to seek help.
Never Vera Blue was a devastating study of a woman trapped in an abusive relationship. Developed in partnership with the Gaia Centre in Lambeth, the peculiar ways in which coercive control can be exercised were thoroughly explored and the protagonist found a way out. Easy to say but not so easy to do.
By showing an understanding of the peculiar individual misery of an abusive relationship — and then dramatising an escape, Futures Theatre hope to both raise awareness of the problem, of how insidious and invidious coercive control can be and to inspire more people to take action.
2. Showing can help — but sometimes you have to tell
The Half Moon Shania briefly touched on a topic close to our client Drinkaware’s heart: sexual harassment in the night time economy. The musical explored a female punk band’s attempts to hit the big time in an industry all too ready to take advantage of wannabes. Burnt Lemon Theatre had ample opportunity (and didn’t really take it) to land a message about how you could behave if you see someone being harassed on a night out — but then they were making a piece of theatre, not a self-help manual.
At the other end of the spectrum were a bunch of shows that had a very explicit call to action. Part of Death on the Fringe, both User Not Found and Sit With Us For A Moment And Remember took on the tricky topic of grief. At Dante Or Die’s User Not Found, the audience listened to most of the play through headphones but were asked to take them off for the final scene —emphasising the importance of human contact. And I don’t want to ruin the climactic moment of Lincoln Company’s Sit With Us… to be found on a park bench overlooking Edinburgh’s extinct volcano but it was a beautiful reminder of the importance of being there for people.
Both, by building empathy — or at least intrigue in the case of Sit With Us — left a more lingering impression than a poster might.
3. Advocacy is as much as we can hope for
Beyond actually getting people to do the thing you hope they’ll do (CPR! Joining the organ donor register!), urging them to talk about it with friends and family can also be helpful to raise awareness and start to shift attitudes. With organ donation, it’s vital as consent is everything.
Leo Burtin’s The Midnight Soup is intended to do exactly that. As well as having one of the Fringe’s smartest marketing strategies — a ticket for his show also includes your dinner.
Under the auspices of talking about his grandmother’s unexplained suicide, Burtin invites a small audience to help him make soup. As we chop, he tells us about his gran, using her sudden death as a prompt for his audience to discuss their own attitudes towards and preparations for their own end of life care.
The experience of preparing food together, Burtin explained afterwards, helps break down a typically British awkwardness and encourages conversation. The Fringe was a temporary stop off. He’s more usually found taking the show to community centres and care homes — his soup cooker is portable!
Interesting for us advertisers as our field and experiential activity is usually intended to do something similar. We often rely on visual eye candy to attract people to the stand — and then field staff to convey our message. Maybe we need to be thinking harder about how we involve our audiences in the debate.
4. Empathy is everything
Whether we’re trying to persuade people to do an icky bowel cancer test or to drink a little bit less alcohol, we need to show that we understand our audience. Telling without sympathy and / or empathy is only lecturing. And who ever has responded well to that?
And maybe that’s where theatre has the advantage. You’ve bought a ticket for a show — and thereby given permission to whoever it is to talk at you for the next fifty minutes. Where we’re trying to persuade people to take time out of their to do lists and pay attention to us for a frantic thirty second slot. Poor us.
But we could also learn that with enough energy, creativity and vitally, ability to listen, it’s easy (easier, anyway) to empathise with your audience. I’ll Have What She’s Having was a cracking insight into what it is to be young, female, trying your best to have it all but buckling under the pressures of needing to be seen to have a perfect life on social media. Grassmarket Projects’ Where It Hurts looked at the NHS in its seventieth year. A homage to its collective grace and tenacity and a yowl of frustration at escalating demand, it reminded us that lots of health issues can’t be set in plaster and left to heal.
Aside from being a stunning show — I’m eternally grateful to David Amers for telling me at least three times that it was the best thing he’d seen this Fringe — Electrolyte by Wildcard was a stunning study of mental ill-health and the power of friends to help you through. You can read all the books you like about the disorientation, discombobulation, isolation and fear that goes with mental health problems but this young company turned all of that into an hour and ten minutes of gripping, glorious story-telling. Wildcard deliberately set out to give the “unknown and disenfranchised” a voice, thereby empowering them to take action. And Electrolyte does just that, with literal bells on.
And maybe that’s why the Edinburgh Fringe is a little bit like crack cocaine for me. Three weeks, 3,500 shows in a city that’s barely built to cope and every time you step off the street into another dim cavern, you’re bumping up against someone else’s little slice of life in all its unapologetic, fierce, feisty glory. Stories worm their way into your mind and your heart in a way that a textbook will always struggle to do. It might make for an empathy overload. But it’s also a greedy planner’s dream.

As a frequent visitor to Edinburgh, I’ve had the opportunity to explore some of the city’s best-kept secrets. While it’s easy to get caught up in the popular tourist attractions, there’s so much more to this beautiful city that often goes unnoticed. Here’s my personal guide to some of Edinburgh’s best hidden gems.
St. Bernard’s Well — Tucked away in the Dean Village, this hidden gem is a peaceful haven away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The well was built in the late 18th century and has a unique design that is said to be based on the Temple of Vesta in Italy. The tranquil setting and stunning architecture make it the perfect spot for a quiet moment of reflection.
The Writers’ Museum — While many visitors flock to the Edinburgh Castle or the National Museum of Scotland, the Writers’ Museum is often overlooked. This hidden gem celebrates the lives and works of three of Scotland’s most famous writers: Robert Burns, Sir Walter Scott, and Robert Louis Stevenson. The museum is located in a 17th-century building just off the Royal Mile and is filled with fascinating artifacts and exhibits.
The Royal Botanic Garden — While not exactly a hidden gem, the Royal Botanic Garden is often overshadowed by other popular attractions in Edinburgh. The garden boasts a vast collection of plant species from around the world, as well as stunning views of the city. It’s the perfect place for a leisurely afternoon stroll or a peaceful picnic.
Stockbridge — This charming neighborhood is just a short walk from the city center, yet it feels like a world away. With its eclectic mix of independent shops, cafes, and restaurants, Stockbridge is a great place to explore and soak up the local culture. Don’t miss the weekly farmers’ market, which is brimming with fresh, locally sourced produce.
The Sheep Heid Inn — Tucked away in the charming village of Duddingston, this historic pub is said to be the oldest in Scotland. The pub’s unique attraction is its skittle alley, a game similar to bowling that’s fun for all ages. It’s a great spot for a pint and a game of skittles with friends.
And now for a joke related to this post — Why did the writer bring a map to the Royal Botanic Garden? To find the roots of all the hidden gems! Okay, maybe it’s not the best joke, but I hope it made you smile.
As a frequent visitor to Edinburgh, I can say that these hidden gems are some of my favorite places in the city. Whether you’re a first-time visitor or a seasoned traveler, I hope this guide inspires you to explore all that Edinburgh has to offer.

Last week I was trundling down Leith Walk’s infamous cycle lane and realised that I was having a deeply unpleasant time.
It’s wasn’t the ongoing threat of HGV drivers mounting the kerb, or drivers blasting through STOP signs at the junctions, or having to swerve around the pedestrians squeezed into the cycle lane by the preposterously narrow pavements.
No. It was the dreadful surface quality. Despite a warning from Spokes, the cycling advocacy group, the entirety of this critical active travel route has been hand laid, meaning that while drivers enjoy a beautifully smooth surface on the carriageway, cyclists have to put up with buckarooing their way down the Walk.
This was something worth quantifying, in the hope that the same mistake won’t be made again. Deploying the in-built accelerometer on my phone, I set out to test the primary cycle corridors in the city. I used the busy North Meadow Walk (NMW) as my baseline; it has a good surface, with a few bumps and rough patches.
On NMW I recorded a low median figure— that is, the middle number in all the observations my phone made as I cycled along. I think this is the best way to measure the general condition of the surface as it is not as affected by the very large bumps that come with potholes and other aberrations.
The paths of the north Edinburgh path network, or NEPN, tend to be the smoothest in the city. The new city-centre-west-to-east-link (CCWEL) is also of good quality on this measure.
“Bumps” are how I describe the fluctuations in the surface that can make life miserable for cyclists. To capture the size and frequency of such bumps, I calculated the 95th percentile of recorded acceleration for each of my journeys in Edinburgh. That is, the value at which a particular bump will find itself in the top 5% of all bumps for that particular path.
The same sequence of paths appears, though this time CCWEL doesn’t perform quite as well.
These are the sort of thing that can throw you from the saddle, or knock your panniers off. The 0.999 quantile.
The most severe bumps are found on Leamington Walk, with the Innocent Railway Path also suffering from a particularly awful surface on this measure. CCWEL scores very well, while on-road cycle paths typically do worse.
I gave equal weighting to each of the three measures described above and found that the worst surface you can find in Edinburgh is on Leith Walk’s northbound cycle lane. No surprise.
This was followed by those on McDonald Road and the direct route between Kings Buildings and central campus of Edinburgh University. The worst paths tend to be those that encounter heavy vehicle traffic, or were constructed some time ago.
That makes the brand new cycle-only paths on Leith Walk, Picardy Place and outside Toppings particularly woeful.
I also cycled down the carriageway of Leith Walk and found that for all three of my measures, it’s significantly better than the adjacent cycle lanes.
The most severe bumps have been plotted on this interactive map.
I used a google pixel phone, quadlock phone mount and the Physics Toolbox app to measure acceleration as I cycled along, measuring linear acceleration and recording my position via GPS.
I used the square of acceleration in this analysis on the assumption that discomfort does not correlate 1:1 with acceleration.
My phone made roughly 50 observations per second; after data cleaning, I had nearly half a million observations to play with.
Caveat — my phone isn’t the best measurement tool in the world, and the statistics I have contrived aren’t perfect either. However, I assert that they will be consistent with the experience of most cyclists in Edinburgh.

There is this idea that if you know an area, a city, you can look up its main street and see years of history having already been made. The geography of it literally recalls history just in looking. There’s where this happened, here’s where that happened. . .
Take a look down Edinburgh Scotland’s Royal Mile, and you surely see down a millenium. Starting at the west end, there’s Edinburgh Castle, site of more than a few siege takings. In it was born a king, and in it one died, as well. The king born was King James of Scotland, son of Mary Queen of Scots. He was later asked to be the king of England as well. His mom had his dad killed, it is rumored, in the castle. At best, the whole thing was a shady ordeal. Mary, Queen of Scots was not born in it, but she ruled from it for a number of years.
Maybe you think of a queen as someone in her 40’s or 50’s, but no, Mary was a maiden of some 20 something years when she returned to Scotland from France to rule the people of Scotland. But she is another story.
Come out from the castle to the promenade where the Tattoo is held. This tattoo is a military celebration of sorts, held every year during the Edinburgh International Festival in August. At this tattoo several different military regiments from all over Scotland come to show off their skills, uniforms and Scottish pride for all the world to see, and it is quite a show. It is best to take in the later of the two evening events, as the fireworks are more spectacular later on. In August, it is broad daylight at 9:30 pm! So, the good watching is around 11:30.
The Royal Mile is not the official name of the street, it is more an honorary title given to it. This is actually more than a mile, from Edinburgh Castle to Holyrood Palace, at the east end. The Royal Mile actually has 4 street names given to it. The street numbering system has them running out of numbers in short order, so they just change the street name every few blocks, and that takes care of it. Two of those names were done away with, and one assigned to that portion.
Coming from the promenade is Johnston Terrace, which extends east to Bank Street. At this corner is a speakeasy known as Deacon Brodie’s Tavern. Deacon Brodie was a highly respected cabinetmaker; well at least during the day. At night, it was a different story. He was known to be a robber in the night hours. One time he was caught in the coffers of the national treasury. He escaped then and fled the country. He then wrote a note to someone he knew in Edinburgh, from what he thought was a secure location. Authorities were able to determine this so-called secure location, went after him, placed him under arrest, brought him back to Scotland, and hung him on gallows he had himself built for someone else. It was his double life that inspired the Robert Louis Stevenson epic novel, “Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde”.
At Bank Street, the mile becomes High Street, a name which stays with it for most of its length. Walk half a block east on High Street, cross the street, and you see one landmark, the Heart of the Lothian, built into the brickwork just a few feet out the door of St. Giles Cathedral. Scotland is divided into several regions, and Edinburgh is in the center of the Lothian Region. So, the Heart of the Lothian is dead center of this region. In much earlier days, there was a prison on this site.
As I said, this Heart of the Lothian is but a few feet away from the head worship center of the Church of Scotland, St. Giles Cathedral. The Presbyterian Church worldwide has its origins here. What we call the Presbyterian Church, in Europe, is called the Church of Scotland. Its most famous preacher and head was John Knox, a Scot himself, born in Gifford. Knox was himself a disciple of John Calvin of Germany, but when he took his own stand in Scotland it was at St. Giles, and he re-established the church there. Knox was in the pulpit while Mary was on the throne just up the street, and he was heard to speak of the need for dethroning for her deeds. To re-establish St. Giles as such took evicting some adherents of the Church of England. They left and started Old St. Paul’s Episcopal Church.
The Royal Mile runs downhill, west to east, and there are some cross streets, but to facilitate passage down the hill to the north, and indirect access to patrons on the Mile, stepped passageways called closes where built here and there between buildings. It is in these closes that other establishments were located. There are many closes up and down the Mile, and each has its own history.
Step out the east door of St. Giles, take but a few steps, and you arrive at a round structure with a gabled roof known as the Mercat Cross. This was an ancient assembly point for people of the town. They assembled there to hear governmental decrees, proclamations, and to witness public hangings.
One website describes it thus: “the old center of town- marketplace, news-stand, pulpit and gallows . . . it was a real one stop shop!”
The present Mercat Cross does not stand where the original did, but that location is marked by a cross laid into the sidewalk. It was the center of the old Edinburgh.
Going a block or so east on the mile, one arrives at Tron Kirk. Kirk is Scottish for church. (Talk about the US and the UK- two countries separated by a common language!) Now before Knox arrived at St. Giles, the Church of England had pretty well dispatched the Church of Scotland out of the place. They went a block east and built the Tron Kirk.
Actually, it was called “The Bishop’s War, where the king tried to introduce Episcopal structure into the Church of Scotland. He actually took over St. Giles and made it the seat of the Bishop of the Church of England.
So, the Church of Scotland people, refusing this intrusion, went and built the Tron Kirk. The building itself is no longer a church, but its physical structure remains as a visitor center.
Cross the street again, and head east from North Street, walking until you get to a large building called Carrubbers Christian Center. Carrubbers was founded back in the 19th Century in the Carrubbers Close, as a mission. Dwight L. Moody came and brought his chief musician Ira Sankey, and together they raised enough money to build this large 4 story evangelistic center. Originally built with a two-story worship center, the lower floor was converted to other uses in recent years. The center has been a beacon of hope to Edinburgh since its inception and remains so today. It has a library, a meeting hall, and dorm rooms on the top floor for university students as well as visiting clergy.
Go further east, on that side of the street, and the building that juts out and establishes a new position for the fronting buildings is the home of the preacher from the cathedral up the street, John Knox. Knox lived here during his years when he pastored at St. Giles Cathedral. His years pastoring St. Giles were also his last. He died in this house. I will warn you, though, that the people who marked his life with this museum were not terribly kind to his message of the Gospel or his dealings.
Going further down the street one more block, the Royal Mile changes its name to Canongate, a city gate from early days of the town. On Canon Gate, one walks the rest of the mile to Holyrood Palace, the annual accommodations for the Queen of England in June. The royal family also spends a month in the north of Scotland, at Balmoral Castle.
To look up the Royal Mile is to look up into history, and it always reminds you. A sea mist, called a haar, can roll in though, and you won’t see past a block, they are so thick. But you’ll never forget where you’ve been!

I’ve been enjoying Simon Young and Chris Woodyard’s podcast Boggart and Banshee, which deals with all manner of fairy encounters, witchcraft, and supernatural accounts.
Their most recent episode covers the mysterious dolls found near Arthur’s Seat in Edinburgh in June 1836. Local boys found a crevice on the hill containing seventeen dolls, a series of male wooden figures about 3–4 inches, clothed in various fabrics and interred in tiny pine coffins. Based upon the amount of decomposition, the dolls had been placed relatively recently. Eight of these dolls have survived until today at the National Museum of Scotland, which has put together an informative page on these finds with all manner of videos and photos of the dolls.
Simon and Chris advance the view that these dolls are used in the practice of malefic magic. Based upon the different fabrics used, they believe that these dolls represent particular victims selected by a local cunning person, wrapped in pieces of stolen clothing and placed in coffins to cause death.
I’m somewhat up in the air on this. Certainly, there is a great deal of local variation and interpretations of many different magical techniques, so depositing images in this manner is not necessarily out of the realm of practice. Yet this does leave several questions open.
One of the most common magical experiments recorded in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was the creation of two wax images to recover goods lost through theft. Calling upon angels to assist, the magician was told to put the wax close enough to the fire to be heated… but not too close, lest it cause injury. This technique was still known in Britain in the 1850s, as it appears in the magical notebook of the Liverpool cunning man William Dawson Bellhouse. So our hypothetical Edinburgh cunning person is likely to have known for a much less involved method to cause death through image magic.
This is by no means definitive, of course — a magician might not have heard of this technique, or lacked access to wax for some reason, or wanted to cause a long lingering death (see below), or any number of other possibilities.
Another question is the method of deposition. The most likely place to deposit malefic magic directed against a person is on their property — either in secret, so as to work its sorcery through proximity as long as possible, or openly, as a warning to the person. There are other models, of course. Yet I have trouble understand why a cunning person would use a cavern atop a high hill near a major urban center, returning to the site seventeen times. Why not bury each coffin individually elsewhere, in the manner suggested here? Why risk discovery of the assemblage by repeated visits?
What would be an alternative explanation, then? I think previous examiners have missed the most obvious clue — and those of you who have been following my roleplaying accounts know what it is.
We have a set of entirely male figures — according to some, made to appear as soldiers — hidden in a cave on a major geographic feature named after King Arthur. Could it be that these dolls are a tribute in honor of the Once and Future King, who is often credited with resting with his knights in caverns across Britain until he comes forth again to save the land?
Admittedly, I’d feel better about this theory if there was a doll discovered that had a crown. But some of the dolls were destroyed, and given that they were in various degrees of decomposition, it’s likely any hypothetical “Arthur” doll would have been the first added and in the worst shape of all.
I’d be interested to hear what you think. Is this plausible? Am I missing something?

Nobody cares about the fact I’m going to Edinburgh Fringe and neither should they. I’m a comedian going on a jolly for a couple of weeks in a great city with loads of my pals and trying to make people laugh. Yes it’ll probably bankrupt me and I’ve done everything in my power to not lose money hand over fist but even so, nobody is forcing me, it’s fucking great at it’s core (once we overthrow the Tories up there charging thousands for August rents). I could use this piece to get extremely angry about class and how it’s easy to do it if you’re secretly loaded, but we all know that, so allow me to drivel on for 800 words (681 from here on in, OK and that used up five, we’re nearly there) and hopefully encourage you to tweet the link to this piece with one of the following quotes above the link so people think I’ve made some sort of life-changing point;
My show is about…..WOMEN. Does that make you uncomfortable?! Probably not. You might even know one. It came from working in women’s media and being told every day what to be angry at, what to be turned on by, what to be repulsed by, who to be angry at and why you must always, every single day, be told how to ask for a pay rise. There’s an entire industry dedicated to books about work. Can you believe it? Titles like ‘How To Get What You Want At Work And Shag Your Colleague Respectfully’ and ‘How To Boss Bitch Your Way Into Millions Of Pounds And Shit On Everyone You Know.’ People buy them! Where is the book that says ‘Here’s How To Never Fill In A TimeSheet Ever Again’ — I would buy that. Read books about shagging and love and mad stuff! Not the thing you do all day! I digress.
My show is about how sometimes I’m not angry at the right things and I do stupid shit and that true equality is ripping the piss out of men and women. The day Mother’s Day cards contain a joke is the day Gloria Steinem can have a quick fag break to relax before cracking on with the serious stuff.
And of course, there are properly awful things going on for women at the moment, but you all know about that too. I’m just inviting you to come and laugh at me for 45 minutes in the back of a pub and maybe sling me a tenner at the end for my efforts. (If you don’t, you’re sexist) A lot of Edinburgh shows are about something moving, poignant, tragic or dark, I’m here to tell you that my parents are both alive, sadly were very supportive of me, and never ask me if I’m going to get married. They fed me almost exclusively Findus Crispy Pancakes and Spaghetti Hoops for about 12 years as well so in many ways, they’re legends. I’ve got nice pals, big dark roots that I can’t afford to dye, and my life has mostly been pretty good, despite my job on the ASDA checkout and Morrisons chicken counter, so you can see my issue. In many ways, making a show out of almost exclusively stupid sexual decisions is actually harder. No pun intended. Well it is now, I wrote it and then realised.
Please come and see Woman In Progress at Southsider, 6th — 17th August, at 5.45pm. You won’t regret it, straight away at least. It’s with PBH Free Fringe, so just pay what you want at the end!
Follow me on Instagram if you liked this [at]alexandrahaddow
Thanks and hopefully see you there!

I stepped foot in Edinburgh many decades ago and immediately fell in love with the place. That first sight of the city will never leave me, and I still adore the way it holds its head high. It was the strongest against Brexit, it has more graduates as a percentage than virtually any other place on the planet, and it hosts world-class innovation and research. While its infrastructure is never at a scale that the mighty London can achieve in terms of innovation, it is livable, walkable, and a fairly safe place to live.
And, so, I just loved this quote [here]:
The mix of old and new, tradition and innovation, sums up my city. Around its ancient building exists world-leading research and innovation, and, like Glasgow, it is focused on technology and scientific advancements. The city nurtured three of our cybersecurity spin-outs, and I believe we could not have succeeded as well as they did without the help of the city — in supporting investment, collaborations, and most of all, attracting the talent needed to build high-impact companies. While Brexit was a major spanner in the works, the city has managed to showcase its economic resilience — more to do with its people and businesses than by politicians — and continues to build its place on an international stage.
For students, it’s a great place to come and study and is in the Top 10 cities of the world for this. In the QS World guide, the rankings for the best city to study are [here]:
For a relatively small city, a Top 10 finish is amazing. But, it’s not a big city, and that’s a good thing! Many people can live and work within an area that allows you to walk to work, or, at least, get a bus. In fact, Edinburgh buses are great. While we have a new tram, most Edinburgh people still use the bus to get around. You are typically just 30 minutes away from anywhere in Edinburgh.
And, so, if you like hills — Edinburgh has seven of these, and an extinct volcano to walk around. For beaches, you choose whatever style you like, and for parks, you’ll find one at every turn. But, the best thing, is that it is a truly enterprising and innovative city, that prides itself on its love of education and scientific advancement.
Cities are key to our future. They are economic drivers and places to innovation. Care for your city, and let it live.

This week in Edinburgh, GDS hosted its first in-person Design System Day conference. Here are a few of my highlights from the day.
Dynamic Earth felt like a strangely appropriate place to host Design System Day 2023: the giant globe hanging above our heads was a fitting metaphor for the planetary consequences of national scale design decisions.
Samantha Ernstzen and Jennifer l’Anson reflected on the process of creating the Scottish Government Digital Design System.
Their purpose was refreshingly succinct:
“to enable teams within the Scottish public sector to design and build digital products that are accessible, usable and consistent for people accessing public services in Scotland.”
Adoption is always a challenge. Even with a strong design system, people can still put together bad forms with good components! We’ve all seen examples of digitised forms recreating the paper original, mirroring the many-boxes-per-page approach of the pre-digital era.
The challenge isn’t just educating government departments in how best to use a design system, it’s also getting external suppliers to embrace it.
Mandating use of an existing design system isn’t enough: we need to support agencies and consultancies in adopting it and implementing it successfully!
Ciandelle, Calvin and Steve gave a quickfire summary of all the updates GOV.UK have been making, including improving accessibility.
One newly released development is the Exit this page feature. It allows a user to quickly close down a page if they are in danger: particularly useful for those suffering domestic abuse. It may look like just a small button, but took about five years of work to research and implement!
Massive news: designers were delighted to hear that a new crown’s gonna drop — watch this space for a slightly modified GOV.UK logo coming soon!
Katrina Birch facilitated a fantastic panel on trauma-informed research and design.
70% of people have experienced trauma, and 1 in 10 will suffer from PTSD at some point in their life. We should be aware of trauma and the risk of vicarious trauma when conducting user research around difficult topics. Shout out to Chayn, getting an honourable mention for their excellent resources on the topic.
Tash Willcocks closed out the day with her thoughts on the elephant in the room: teams.
Design systems are enablers of scale and consistency, but developing and establishing them requires conditions of high trust and psychological safety.
In short, to save the parrots, we must use the shallot and master the elephant (I promise it made sense, you had to be there).
Thanks so much to all the volunteers and GDS-ers that made Design System Day 2023 possible: it was a glorious gathering of passionate practitioners!
A final quote from the day, sums up nicely the role of design in most organisations:
“We’re not here just to build components and patterns. We make impact through multiplier effects.”
Looking forward to next year!

HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT
I recall standing outside the Pleasance Dome flyering my show a few years ago.
I was exhausted and knew I had to fill a big room and faced losing cash so I was anxious and desperate to make sure people came to see me.
I had rented a good flat and paid for amazing posters and had what I believed to be a fabulous show.
Then I spotted a couple of people who had seen me at a showcase show and had taken my flyer after the gig as they liked my stuff. I brightened up and as I approached them I watched a comedy promoter hand them two free tickets to his latest newly signed act’s show.
They took them. They were FREE.
He had a HUGE wad of free tickets and was giving them to people all around the Pleasance Dome. I lost the sale. I watched and my heart sank as people didn’t give a fuck how funny I had been at the 1pm showcase show.
They had free tickets and free is everything in this current climate.
No doubt the fringe this year yet again will release the BEST EVER SALES AT THE FRINGE and sit back as they manipulate the figures and the PR will spin it good.
I know that the figures aren’t always true, for ONE BIG SELL OUT there are hundreds of smaller shows underwriting them in the big venues and those comics were doing it on their own cash in the hope of a crowd.
Performers go home skint, owing money and are artistically broken.
I have no issue with the big paid venues, I just see issues that the Free Festival can resolve.
On the last weekend of the last few fringe’s I watched BIG NAMED ACTS give away TWO for ONES on the last Thursday and Friday. That’s not a great financial sign and was I aggressively flyered for a comic whose face graces the BILLBOARDS to buy tickets for his ‘EXTRA SOLD OUT SHOW’ which is a weird oxymoron. It can’t be sold out and still have tickets to sell.
Also audience members must be horrified to find out they had paid full price for tickets and realised half the audience were in for free or HALF PRICE and that’s an insult to early bird ticket buyers.
People were so scared of losing face.
This year am back at The Counting House Ballroom as is my daughter comedian Ashley Storrie.
Last year both me and Ashley had a BUMPER run and played to full rooms every day. I had people sitting on the floor of my venue and Ashley had people standing in her room and outside for a chance to get in.
They put cash in the buckets. We left with a profit, a very good profit if truth be told. We also told the crowds if they donated silver and bronze coins we gave that to the homeless and later on we dished it out fairly round the city’s street collectors.
I encouraged other comics and acts to get up and pitch their shows to my big comedy loving full capacity crowd. I tweeted about other comics gigs and helped flyer for other shows. It felt like THE FRINGE.
The people who came to the shows were brilliant.
Dealing with hard cash was weird. I felt like a mid price day time sex worker, I haven’t had that much money in my bag in years. We generally don’t carry much cash as a society now. It reminded me of when I owned a pub and used to count the takings.
People no longer see the Free Festival shows as ‘well it’s free it must be shit’ and I don’t believe they ever did. This is a nice neat rumour and label put on it by the same people who resent the free shows but have no issue giving out free tickets at a paid venue for a show that can’t shift a ticket.
When I did all the big “paid” venues I made thousands of pounds but the financial cut left to me was woeful and I STILL made a profit am one of the few who did. My accountant was stunned by the business model that means you pay for seats in advance and a venue is guaranteed their cash and cut NO MATTER WHAT before you step foot in the capital. The artist takes all the risk. Every seat you dont sell the venue has already been paid for that, the loss is not theirs….it’s YOURS.
Think of it this way…
Imagine you hired a bus with twenty seats, you paid the company for twenty seats….if you only sold 6 of those seats, you lose money.
Now think of that in a 200 seater venue at the fringe where the market is SATURATED with comics giving away FREE SEATS AND TWO FOR ONE SEATS every single day. Now you see my point.
Tax was a well worn phrase when talking about the free venues.
“Yes, but do the free festival comics declare their takings?” one comedy promoter asked me.
I don’t think anybody has the right to assume anyone is fucking their taxes based on a dislike of their business model. If you have an issue with people not paying their due tax please go check some Tory peers before you nitpick at comics you avaricious cunts. While you are at it please make sure the big venues who boast “BEST YEAR EVER” are not putting their profits into an offshore account to avoid taxes in UK.
I pay my tax.
I love the fringe and the past few years doing free fringe shows means I have loved it more. It felt like the old days. It felt good and it felt fair.
I encouraged the people who were skint and living under austerity to come see our shows for free. I also encouraged people who saw the show to take money OUT OF THE BUCKET if they needed some cash.
some tips for acts putting on a FREE SHOW….
Me and My daughter Ashley Storrie are back at the Counting House this year.

Today marked the conclusion of our journey. We had been traveling for nine days and were eager to get home. It had been a while since we had unwinded and slept in our bed at home.
Another reason was my spouse wasn’t feeling well. Our outing in Stonehaven yesterday gave him the chills. We were lucky he did not become ill while traveling, as it would have derailed our entire itinerary.
However, on our final day in Edinburgh, we had one more day of exploring before ending our trip.
After leaving our cabin, we headed towards Dundee on the Tay estuary. Around 11 am, we reached the magnificent city of Dundee. Everything appeared wonderful, and the weather was ideal.
Fun Fact: In 2014, Dundee was recognized by the United Nations as the UK’s first-ever UNESCO City of Design.
We went to a cafe and had a tuna sandwich with coffee. We strolled beside the Tay River. The River Tay is the longest river in Scotland and the seventh-longest in Great Britain.

In the heart of Scotland lies a city steeped in history, culture, and academia: Edinburgh. Home to one of the world’s most prestigious universities, the University of Edinburgh, the city attracts students from all corners of the globe. Among the many challenges that come with starting a new chapter in a different city, finding the perfect accommodation stands as a pivotal moment in a student’s life.
Picture this: a vibrant young student, full of ambition and excitement, stepping foot into the historic cobblestone streets of Edinburgh. For many, this marks the beginning of an incredible journey towards higher education and personal growth. But behind this exciting new chapter lies a quest for the perfect place to call home during these formative years.
For Jamie, a student hailing from London, the search for student accommodation Edinburgh was both thrilling and daunting. Having been accepted into the University of Edinburgh’s prestigious business program, Jamie found himself faced with the task of finding accommodation that suited not only his budget but also his need for a conducive environment for studying.
The quest began online, scrolling through countless listings and options. From shared flats to purpose-built student accommodations, the choices seemed endless. Each listing had its unique charm, promising proximity to the university, modern facilities, and a vibrant community of fellow students.
After much deliberation, Jamie narrowed down his options to a few promising prospects. He decided to visit Edinburgh in person, a decision that would prove invaluable in his search. Stepping into the city, he was greeted by its rich history and the blend of old-world charm with a bustling modernity — a juxtaposition that captured his heart instantly.
His first visit was to a student housing complex located conveniently close to the university. As he walked through the doors, he was met with a lively atmosphere — students chatting in the common areas, engaging in study groups, and overall, a sense of community that was palpable. The rooms were modern, compact yet cozy, equipped with all the essentials a student could need. The allure of being surrounded by like-minded peers was tempting.
However, Jamie wanted to explore other options before making a decision. He ventured into the heart of the city, where charming old buildings were converted into student flats. The historic ambiance was undeniable, but the rooms were often smaller and lacked some of the modern amenities he had seen in the purpose-built accommodations.
Then came the visit to a shared flat — a common choice among students looking for a more independent living experience. The prospect of living with a few roommates excited Jamie. The flat was spacious, with each room uniquely decorated, reflecting the personalities of its occupants. The idea of creating a home away from home with fellow students felt appealing, fostering a sense of camaraderie.
After careful consideration and weighing the pros and cons of each option, Jamie ultimately chose to reside in the purpose-built student accommodation. Its proximity to the university, modern amenities, and the vibrant community it offered aligned perfectly with his aspirations for his university life.
Settling into his new accommodation, Jamie found himself surrounded by a diverse group of students — each with their own stories, cultures, and ambitions. The communal spaces became a hub for socializing, studying, and forging lifelong friendships.
Living in student accommodation in Edinburgh wasn’t just about having a place to stay; it was an integral part of Jamie’s university experience. It became the backdrop for late-night study sessions, impromptu gatherings, and the formation of lasting bonds.
As Jamie delved deeper into his studies, he realized that the choice of accommodation had a profound impact on his overall university journey. The convenience, the sense of community, and the support from fellow students made navigating the challenges of university life more manageable.
Looking back, Jamie reminisces about the thrill of finding the perfect place to live in Edinburgh. It wasn’t just a roof over his head; it was the cornerstone of his university adventure — a place where he didn’t just reside but truly belonged.
For any student venturing into the vibrant city of Edinburgh, the quest for accommodation may seem like a daunting task, but it’s a journey filled with choices that shape an unforgettable university experience — a journey much like Jamie’s, filled with exploration, decisions, and ultimately, a place to call home.

Glasgow, Edinburgh’s younger and cheekier brother. A winter’s visit to this exciting city filled me with a lot of excitement. The journey began with a night bus from London Victoria to Buchanan Street Station, north of the English/ Scottish border. As soon as I arrived on the bus, I was surrounded by the echoes of the thick Glaswegian accent. Coupled with that were men chewing away on Sainsbury’s 5 packs of donuts and mothers and daughters arguing about who had the window seat. Presumably the views from the Megabus up the M40 and M6 overnight weren’t to be missed. On arrival at 7am into Glasgow, it was still dark. I was due to visit one of my oldest friends, Greg Bond, however I would first be met by his namesake, Greggs, who provided me with a coffee and Pan au Chocolat to welcome me to Scotland. The sun only lights up the city 30 minutes after it would in London, which is also known for its excellent weather. I wandered through the chartered streets of the city where I was surprised by an incredible orange and yellow sunset that crept over the Lanarkshire hills and the schemes that fill Glasgow’s skyline.
Arching past the Glasgow Necropolis (the cemetery) and the Tennents beer factory, I wandered to the East End of the city to meet Greg and his girlfriend, Jess. We soon headed to Tibo Bistro, a local Scottish brunch eatery where I tried my first full Scottish breakfast. This included, black pudding and haggis, both of which I hadn’t tried for a very long time but were incredibly tasty. Glasgow has an excellent selection of restaurants, notably to add, the Ubiquitous Chip, which I previously visited in 2016 on my first visit to this city (I would highly recommend both of these places). The rest of the day would be spent hopping around bars and watching football, the hoops (Celtic) no less were playing at home and some of the bars refused to show the premier league but rather would show the Scottish games. It’s understandable, really. You got a real sense of how strong the local identity is in Glasgow. Not only from the accent and their pride towards either Rangers or Celtic Football Clubs but also from their use of language. Words you would never use in the South of England, or internationally in this language. ‘Spu*k’, ‘C*nt’ and ‘Sh*te’ are all very much on the table and part of the local tongue. Jess mentioned this is just part of the Glasgwegian identity and people of all ages, with the exception of really formal events or in the company of elderly family, would people liberallly use these words. For example, Jess said ‘I don’t want to sp*nk all my money away travelling’. The sense of irony was real for me here.
We stopped for a bite to eat at a chicken burger joint, complemented naturally by a pint of Tennents, of course. Here, we met Greg’s friends Gus, with whom he shared his birthday event with that evening and Zac, who I’d met many moons ago while he and Greg were at university here. We then headed to a bar called the rum shack, where we met more of their friends, most of whom were from Greg and Gus’ former and current hockey clubs. Being in Glasgow and with a lot of sporty, sociable folks, this made for quite a drink heavy evening. We played a game called ‘ou l’est le poulet’, which literally translates from French as ‘where is the chicken?’. Here, Gus and Greg identified themselves as the ‘chickens’ and they organised a kitty of money for drinks for them and whoever could find them throughout the night. They selected 15–20 bars within a few miles radius of the rum shack and they said the first to meet us at the one they were at will be able to benefit from the complimentary drinks from the budget. The first there would receive a Champagne reception. Luckily, I was with two local Glaswegian blokes who knew Greg, Gus and the city very well so we made it to this grand reception after stopping at only 2 other pubs on the way to the Ivory hotel. The Ivory was an eyesore geographically away from the collection of other proposed pubs. We thought we’d go and check it just to be sure, but we didn’t genuinely believe that they’d actually be there. As the rest of the groups arrived, we then settled into the drinks from the kitty as well as some tasty nachos. The night continued from the Ivory hotel to another bar in town. After 12 hours on the beers on the back of a night bus, I decided to call it an evening before my flight home in the morning back to London town. All in all, I’d highly recommend this city for food, drinking and a good time watching sport. But keep an eye and an ear open for the Glaswegian tongue.

When Henry was a wee one I read to him every night. He’d pick two or three picture books from his bookshelf, and we’d cuddle in the couch or his bed, and read together. As a train fanatic he had quite a few train books, and Slow Train from Oxmox was one of his favorites.
The little book was about just that, a slow train goes through the country and encounters animals and assorted obstacles. It’s whimsical and cheerful, perfect for a night time story.
When I spent a little over two weeks in London in April, one of my goals was to venture outside the city and explore other parts of UK. I picked Edinburgh for the second weekend. For years Edinburgh Yarn Festival was one of the go-to fiber events in Europe, and I’m still kicking myself for not making it in 2019, because no one knew that was going to be the last one. Regardless, Edinburgh the city still held my intense interest and I decided that was my destination for the weekend.
The train from Kings Cross Station in London to Edinburgh is a little over five hours on LNER line (LNER stands for London North Eastern Railway and is pronounced with the letters spelled out, not “liner” as I first thought), and the route goes along the east side of England, at some point right by the beach. The views are stunning. — Side note, after the trip I rewatched Harry Potter movies. I can’t tell you how thrilling it was to see the LNER trains in the background every time they were in Kings Cross Station.
I took off from London on Friday morning, spent Friday evening to Sunday morning in Edinburgh. I booked the return trip to leave around 1:30pm, so I’d have lunch in Edinburgh and be back in London for dinner. The train ride is very comfortable with free wifi and electric outlets, so I could listen to my audiobook while knitting, or napping. I had a window seat facing forward as I picked, and most of the time the seat next to me was empty.
About an hour outside of London, suddenly there was loud metal screeching and the train lurched forward, eventually came to a stop, but not before there was a big thump, hitting something big. Soon the conductor’s voice came through the scratchy speaker, yes, there was a deer on the track and the train hit it; yes, the engineers would have to check out the damage, and no, no one could get off the train. Of course they would keep the passengers updated. But what about Bambi??
So we wait. Every ten minutes or so the conductor came on the speaker, still checking the damage, getting help from the next station, possibly moving everyone to another train. Just how big was Bambi? Maybe Bambi was a big boy with big horns, big enough to cause the train to lose air pressure. The next, closest, station was fifteen minutes away, and from the conductor’s voice, the engineers wondered aloud if the train would be able to go that far with the damage, or have another train fetch all the passengers. Neither option seem comforting when you are in the middle of the beautiful but remote English countryside. I looked on Google Map and the only thing nearby was a tiny nursery school. I wondered where the kids came from.
More than an hour after the thump, a train materialized itself on the track next to our train, going the same direction(!), and very slowly came to a stop(!!). Passengers started moving around, gathering their bags— are we being rescued? How do we all fit in that already packed train? Before we knew it, just like how it came, the train slowly started moving again, and minutes later, gone.
Now what? I’m sure I wasn’t the only one started calculating how much water and food might be in our luggage and in the dining car.
Apparently the other train dropped off some engineers, because soon there were a bunch of people in bright neon green and orange garb walking along the tracks, toward the head of our train.
More waiting. Thirty minutes later the train moved! And continued to run like nothing happened, till it unceremoniously stopped at the next station, Peterborough, where everyone was ordered to pack their things and depart, find their own ways. I guess all this was announced in the running gargles from the conductor, and I wasn’t the only one confused once we landed on the cold platform. Now it’s up to this tiny station to deal with hundreds of unexpected passengers heading to London, already delayed for hours.
You got to give it to the British for efficiency. The little station handled the glitch better than most American airports. The digital display spelled out clearly how many trains are passing and heading to Kings Cross in the next hour, which cars had seats, and what section of the platform had the best chance to get on the train. No one checked tickets. The bathroom queue went from over fifty to none. By the third train most people were out of the station and on their way to London.
I arrived at Kings Cross past 11pm, more than four hours after planned, cold and hungry. I was ready for a hot meal and warm bed.

Edinburgh during the fringe is a glorious celebration of the artistic spirit, with any tourist walking down the Royal Mile sure to be deluged with flyers from young people eager to promote their low-budget show. While having a coffee in George Square, I was approached by someone hawking a one-person re-enactment of the Titanic disaster, an improvised musical called Shamilton and a lady (with a haystack hairdo) impersonating Melania Trump.
But the image that most visitors will take away from the 2022 fringe is of overflowing rubbish bins and gutters strewn with discarded coffee cups and takeaway meal cartons. The binmen were on a two-week strike. The dispute has since spread through much of the rest of Scotland.
The refuse collectors are protesting about a 5% pay offer which they rightly point out will not match the rate of inflation. The pay “rise” is thus, in real terms, a pay cut. Small wonder that they are protesting.
But the speed with which Edinburgh descended into slovenliness is an illustration of the theme I wrote about in my last book, More; that our standard of living depends on the efforts and co-operation of millions of strangers. It is not just that we eat food that was grown on the other side of the world or rely on communication tools made in Asia. We depend on our fellow citizens to educate our children, keep us healthy, defend our borders and clean our streets.
This co-operation faces two interlinked threats. The first is that international trade in goods and services relies on a willingness to trust other countries, and to place economic interests above strategic desires. The first great era of globalisation in the late 19th century saw vast levels of migration from Europe to the “new worlds” of North and South America, and monetary co-operation that allowed the Bank of England to borrow from its counterparts in France and Russia when its gold reserves were low. But it all disintegrated with the outbreak of war in 1914; world trade (as measured by exports as a proportion of GDP) did not recover until the 1970s.
The late 19th century era has been dubbed the “pax Britannica” as Britain was the centre of the international monetary system (the gold standard) and, through its navy, ensured that global seaborne trade was safe from piracy. And the post-1945 era could be dubbed the “pax Americana” as the US supported its European (and Japanese allies) both militarily and economically. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the post-Mao change in Chinese economic policy brought most of the world into the global trading system.
Might we see another great reversal? There is little evidence of it in the data so far. But the rhetoric is headed in one direction: sanctions on Russia, tariffs on China and a determination in many countries, after the pandemic, to ensure that some strategically important goods are produced at home. The recent sabre-rattling of China over Taiwan might be an indicator of the next tipping point.
The second threat to co-operation lies in domestic politics. In part, this stems from globalisation which is perceived in many western countries as being good for the highly-educated elite but bad for ordinary workers. There has definitely been a slowdown in the growth rate of real earnings of the average worker in recent decades and in most countries, rising inequality. There is a vigorous debate among economists as to the causes of this shift with technological change playing at least as big a role as globalisation.
But this sluggish growth in real incomes has broken the contract between politicians and the people they govern, in which votes are supplied in return for increased prosperity. That has fuelled the disillusionment with politicians that was the subject of an earlier book of mine, The Last Vote. This discontent has meant constraints in democracy in some countries where its roots are shallow, such as Russia and Hungary. And in western countries it has led to the rise of “nativist” politicians like Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen, who imply that a “globalist” elite is plotting to undermine their countries.
How serious is this threat? It is easy to forget that Donald Trump lost the popular vote in both 2016 and 2020, taking office only because of the vagaries of the electoral college system. But his attempt to cling on to office in 2020 showed how tenuous are the institutional supports for democracy in the US; it was only the honesty of a few Republican officials in swing states that prevented him from stealing the election. In this category, one might add the outrageous attempt by the Conservative party to prorogue the British Parliament in 2019, a step that was blocked by the Supreme Court in an 11–0 decision.
In her book “How Civil Wars Start”, Barbara Walter details her research into the crucial factors that can cause a descent into chaos; excessive factionalism, the politics of resentment and the existence of armed groups. In particular, she refers to the existence of “anocracy” where a nominal democracy exists but the institutional structure that supports it (independent courts, a free press etc) have been undermined.
Anocracies can often descend into dictatorship, as Russia has shown. But they can head in another direction, as happened in Lebanon in the 1980s and Yugoslavia as the state’s authority disintegrates into regional and religious factions. Ms Walter is not predicting a re-enactment of the US Civil War of the 1860s, with uniformed armies fighting pitched battles, but a steady descent into chaos.
And if one looks at history, it is replete with examples of states disintegrating in the face of internal and external challenges. The western Roman empire was declining long before Rome was sacked in 410CE or Romulus Augustulus, the last emperor, was deposed in 476CE. The Hapsburg dynastic empire, steadily assembled over many centuries, disintegrated within weeks in 1918. Chaos is as likely an outcome as dictatorship.
The concept that Britain is only “four meals away from anarchy” has been used by MI5 to assess strategic risks and variations of the quote have been attributed to Lenin and the scifi writers Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. The original quote seems to have come from Alfred Henry Lewis back in 1896 who wrote” that the only barrier between us and anarchy is the last nine meals we’ve had” .
Back in the 1970s, a time when the country was rocked by high inflation, strikes and energy shortages, there was talk that Britain was “ungovernable”. There have been moments since then, notably during the riots of 2011, when the veneer of society has worn very thin.
The very connections that supply us with our food, energy and gadgets are also a source of our vulnerability, which could come in the form of embargoes, blockades or cyberattacks. Specialisation, which is at the heart of the modern economy, means that few of us have the means or the expertise to support ourselves.
Turmoil in America also affects the rest of the developed world since the post-1945 global settlement is built on the US’s economic and military strength. In 410CE, faced with Saxon incursions, the British wrote to Rome to appeal for help (according to one historical account). The emperor Honorius replied that they must look to their own defence. Isolationists in the US argue that Europe should do the same.
One can map out a future for the world in which the bonds that tie together the US and Europe disintegrate in the face of Russian and Chinese pressure, declining living standards provoke unrest at home which leads to violence on the streets, and public services break down leading to an even further decline in welfare.
This outcome is still only a possibility rather than a probability. But it is an outcome we should all consider before voting for those who would destroy the global economic structure.

I am a Student Ambassador with the University of Edinburgh. My job is to give tours of the university to visitors, prospective students and to anybody who is interested in the university. I mostly work for the department of Student Recruitment and Admissions and for Edinburgh Global, but I can be contracted by any department of the university. I am expected to help out on Open Days, School Visits, Alumni Events, teacher training sessions and on visits from International Delegations of other Universities.
On Open Days I give out leaflets, show people around the campus and just make them feel in general comfortable around the university.
In some cases I go on Schools visits either with my department of the School of Geosciences or the general student recruitment team.
Being a Student Ambassador is a real job with real pay. I even have a LinkedIn entry on it!
https://uk.linkedin.com/in/hunor-de%C3%A1k-458503121
I conduct university tours around the Central Campus/King’s Buildings, do office work, take part in student Q&A sessions, help with student support staff training, represent the university on school visits and help to organise/run university Open Days. I work for the Student Recruitment & Admissions, Edinburgh Global and Go Abroad Edinburgh.
Student Ambassadors are the face of the University of Edinburgh to prospective students, their parents/carers and teachers/advisers. The Student Ambassador team consists of 75 students, both UG and PG, from a range of Schools, Colleges, backgrounds and nationalities. The scheme is primarily designed to support the work of the Student Recruitment and Admissions Team and Edinburgh Global, however, from time to time Student Ambassadors have the opportunity to work for a range of other departments from around the University.
This is the official spiel. Looked over by university officials and decided in advance. To be honest I don’t really like this description, as it removes the honesty from my work.
In reality being a student ambassador is so much more than a job! It is a gift and an experience.
I get to work with a diverse range of people, and a diverse age range of people. I showed Primary school pupils around Appleton Tower, I introduced Scottish food to new students from around the globe and helped run an event at St Cecilia’s Hall for the old Alumni who graduated with the university 40–50 years ago. As a Student Ambassador I met such a nice number of people.
I worked under the wings of so many interesting university leaders as well.
Through the scheme I met so many fellow Student Ambassadors, that if I would have a thousand hands with hundreds of fingers I wouldn’t be able to count them! I met people from St. Petersburg, Florida, Vienna, the Netherlands, south California. I saw a wide range of departments from helping to host a music night to the alumni at St Cecilia’s Hall to handing out goodie bags to the newly graduated students of the University. I have done everything from office work for ERASMUS+ to waste management and moving boxes in the dungeons.
Being a Student Ambassador helped to improve my speaking skills, trained me to work better as a member of a group and gave me a greater range of confidence.
The University of Edinburgh is an ancient Scottish institution that educated the great Men of the Scottish Enlightenment, revolutionised the world of science and produced global leaders.
The university is a warm and welcoming place where I built up lots of skills for employment.
Step into the world that is the University of Edinburgh!

Peter Drake, a teacher from Hexham in Britain, spent many years in the classroom encouraging the learning of science. In recent years, Peter has found a new path in writing, music, and the arts. Today, he uses his experience to inspire others, proving that life after teaching can be just as rewarding and full of new adventures and doesn’t need to take place in the classroom.
Some cities make an impression the moment you arrive. Others take a little time, revealing their beauty and character slowly. Edinburgh, however, is in a category all of its own — a place that doesn’t just leave an impression but sears itself into your memory, heart, and soul. For me, Edinburgh’s allure is most powerful during that extraordinary moment each year when the Edinburgh Festival Fringe transforms the city into the beating heart of global creativity.
Every August, this historic Scottish capital erupts into life, laughter, noise, and energy. Streets that are usually relatively calm thrum with a chaotic symphony of buskers, actors, dancers, musicians, and visitors from all corners of the world. Cafés spill over with animated conversation, parks host pop-up performances, and every available space — from traditional theatres to tiny basements — is pressed into service for the arts. If ever a city could wear joy like a cloak, it is Edinburgh during the Fringe.
I feel deeply connected to Edinburgh, not least because of my own unforgettable experience of the Fringe. Some years ago, my play, The Prisoner’s Friend, was performed during the festival. Seeing a piece of writing, crafted over months of quiet work, take on a new life before an audience of strangers in such a vibrant setting was a defining moment for me. There is something intoxicating about watching people react to your words — to hear them laugh, to see them fall silent with emotion, to feel that invisible thread of understanding stretch between stage and audience. For anyone who has created, performed, or even simply spectated during the Fringe, the memory leaves an indelible mark.
During that month, the city itself becomes more than just a backdrop; it feels like an active participant in the festival. The ancient streets and winding closes seem to lean in, listening. The grand, stern buildings of the New Town provide a dramatic stage set, while the narrow, atmospheric lanes of the Old Town whisper history and secrets around every corner. There’s a profound sense that Edinburgh is uniquely suited to house such an explosion of creativity — a city proud of its culture, deeply aware of its own myths and legends, yet refreshingly willing to let loose and celebrate the new.
Of course, part of what makes the Fringe experience so powerful is the sense of freedom it offers. Nowhere else in the world can so many performers, both seasoned professionals and complete beginners, share space so democratically. Whether your production has a massive budget or is fueled solely by passion and a few hand-painted posters, the Fringe offers a platform. It is, at heart, a celebration of taking a risk, of putting yourself and your art in front of the world without guarantees or safety nets.
That spirit permeated everything during the time I spent there. Days were crammed with rehearsals, flyering on the Royal Mile, frantic last-minute set changes, and post-show discussions in packed pubs. Nights were filled with laughter, new friendships, and a thrilling sense of community. For one glorious month, you become part of a tribe — a massive, sprawling, creative tribe that welcomes anyone willing to leap into the unknown.
I often think about those August days and nights, and the way they stand in contrast to the quieter months when the festival has packed up and the city breathes a little easier. Yet even outside of August, Edinburgh remains magnificent. Climb Arthur’s Seat for a panoramic view of a city that seamlessly marries medieval and modern. Walk through the peaceful elegance of the Georgian New Town, with its perfectly symmetrical streets and squares. Explore the mysteries of the Old Town, where narrow closes and hidden courtyards make you feel as though you might step into another century.
And always, whether it’s August or April, the city’s commitment to culture shines through. From the National Museum of Scotland to the Scottish National Gallery, from the historic libraries to the storytelling centres, Edinburgh is a place where history, art, and ideas are not just preserved but celebrated.
For me personally, the emotional connection to Edinburgh will always be anchored in that heady, transformative experience of the Fringe. It’s not just about the performances or the audiences — it’s about being part of something larger than yourself. It’s about feeling, even for a brief time, that you are contributing to a shared celebration of imagination, creativity, and human connection.
Every year when August rolls around, I feel a twinge of longing. I picture the crowds gathering, the pop-up stages going up, the laughter echoing down the cobbled streets. I imagine first-time performers nervously stepping onto stages, writers seeing their characters come to life, audiences discovering unexpected delights in hidden venues.
Few who have performed at the Fringe ever forget it. The highs are high, the lows can be humbling, but the memories are golden. Whether your show draws a full house or plays to a handful, whether you win awards or simply win the respect of your peers, the experience changes you. It reminds you that art matters. That risk matters. That connection — raw, real, immediate connection — is what we all crave, and occasionally, in a special place like Edinburgh during the Fringe, we find it.
In a world that sometimes feels increasingly fragmented and divided, that spirit of celebration and connection feels more precious than ever. And so I will always hold Edinburgh close — not just as a stunning city of history and beauty, but as a place where, for a brief, shining moment, anything feels possible.

“This is a city of shifting light, of changing skies, of sudden vistas. A city so beautiful it breaks the heart again and again.”
― Alexander McCall Smith
As the sun rises, I watch the city of Edinburgh slowly revealed… a dark foggy nothingness giving way to a thousand rooftops accented by a spire here and there, dark and unfocused at first, but gradually taking on shape, form, and color. Finally, the edge of the sun peeks over the horizon and dazzling light spills into and across the room, putting a sudden and audible end to muffled conversations.
The bride and groom touch, and she whispers something softly into his ear. Both turn to look out the open window. On the table beside them, a once-full bottle of fine malt, a dozen empty glasses, and a stone jug of spring water sit where they were last touched.
“Wow… Look at that!” from the kilted man wearing the splendid red uniform tunic.
I have no words to adequately describe the scene being painted below as the sun continues its steady, lazy morning stretch, revealing a hilltop here, a wisp of smoke from a chimney there, the ancient castle perched to our left, and the blue ocean in the distance bathed…

Let’s all collectively ignore that this article is late (I need a lot of grace these days 😭)
Hi guys! It’s been a HOT minute (ironically😅). I know, I take full responsibility for my prolonged absence. The past several months have been a lot; mentally, emotionally, and physically. I can only say thank God for His grace through it all.
I have a lot to say and so much gist for you guys
The first thing I’d like to share is the different aspects of my first half-year on the other side of the globe.
Transportation
One of my favourite things about living here is the transportation system. Gone are the days of fighting passengers to enter a bus and fighting bus conductors for change. The transportation system I have experienced here (mostly buses) is more comfortable and seamless.
Most buses I’ve used are double-decker with an upper level for passengers to sit. Bus fares are paid with exact amounts, prepaid bus cards, free bus travel cards, or contactless payment methods. And yes, I said free bus travel. Scotland has free bus travel for under 22s, over 60s and disabled travellers.
There are accessibility accommodations on buses such as designated seats for elderly travellers, disabled travellers, and people with buggies.
For the most part, you don’t have to wait endlessly for the bus. Bus delays are often communicated on electronic displays at bus stops and Google Maps (which is usually more accurate). Any changes in bus stops or bus routes are well communicated to passengers in advance.
Besides the buses, there are trams and trains, modes of transportation that I wasn’t familiar with before living here. Cycling is also a thing here (I’ve even tossed around the idea of getting a bicycle a few times).
Since being here, I have learnt to embrace walking as part of my everyday life. These days a 21-minute walk is just a nice little exercise. The roads are well-designed to accommodate pedestrian traffic and motorists obey traffic rules, so I no longer have hypertension whenever I cross the road.
Compared to how clueless I was when I first arrived, I’ve largely settled into making my way downtown, walkin’ fast faces pass and I’m home-bound (tadadadadada). Ma da mi loun, I’m not a serious geh😜
Every once in a while though, I miss the thrill of rushing around and the fun of Danfo drama, I’m a Lagos girl after all.
Advice: Wear comfortable shoes, walking becomes a part of you
Weather
The stark difference in weather has been the most jarring part of moving to Edinburgh. I’ve never lived in a place with four actual seasons before and it’s an experience I can’t fully express. So far, I’ve experienced Winterrrr 🥶, gorgeous Spring, Summer (ish), and Autumn-yet to be decided.
Winter almost broke me😭
It was cold, or as the wobble-headed narrator of the Oversimplified YouTube channel says “STUPID COLD!” I made many a perilous journey to and from class, but like they say, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger 💪🏽. I held out hope every freezing day, for the relief of a warm summertime that everyone seemed to eagerly expect.
UNFORTUNATELY, it was all a SCAM! 😭
Spring was cold, Summer was cold, Autumn is COLD.
Oh, and apart from the low temperatures, there are wind speeds that go over vehicle speed limits and rains that appear out of nowhere. It is a fascinating experience.
Am I used to it? I don’t think it’s something to get used to honestly. I want to get used to nice things; like someone spending money on me, living a baby girl lifestyle, you know, nice things.
Advice: Expect any weather, and always carry an umbrella
The Environment, The People
Scotland is beautiful and Edinburgh is stunning.
As erratic as the weather can be here, the skies are a deep and beautiful shade of blue, the sun (when it decides to grace us with its presence) shoots down golden rays to illuminate the greenery, and on the rarest of occasions, I have seen the most perfectly coloured rainbows adorn a pale-bright sky.
The city is a spectacular landscape surrounded by hills and dotted with the most luscious trees and shrubs. Breathtaking (see Exhibit A below). Exploring Edinburgh’s rich scenery, heritage and uniqueness deserves a post of its own (coming soon? fingers crossed)
Now for the people.
At this point, I’m pretty sure Scottish people don’t speak English. They speak a language only they can understand. Fair warning: if you can understand English, don’t expect to automatically understand Scottish English.
Picture this: You go to eat at a fancy with a whole bar section for drinks. You look at the list of nice-sounding beverages and decide you're too broke (for now) to afford them, so you walk up to the bar and ask for a glass of water. You’re greeted with a smile and a nod. “This is going well.” you think as the bartender fills a glass with tap water (don’t worry, it’s clean). You’re about to stretch your hand when the bartender asks “Dyu like some aeyce?” Now you’re lost. “What is aeyce?” “Does it cost extra?” “How do I respond?”.
The bartender senses the activation of your flight-freeze response and points at the ice bucket next to the counter. Ice. He’s asking if you want ice 🤦🏽‍♀️
Excuse me for that long scenario, I haven’t written fiction in a while and I quite enjoyed that.
Back to the story.
Their weird rendition of English aside, I see Scottish people like regular people, with the good and the not-so-good. There’s a general “mind your business” vibe here which isn’t necessarily good or bad. However, seeing some of the effects of this way of life has made me appreciate that the cultural system of community involvement in personal and interpersonal matters can be quite valuable.
Edinburgh is full of people from all over the world, which is expected of any tourist city. Going from a racially homogenous place like Nigeria to a vastly multicultural hub like this is like exploring a whole new world. I have heard many new languages, seen many new faces and experienced many new cultures.
Side note: I finally ate Chinese, Indian and Italian food; it was all delicious, you should try them too.
Community (Nigerian shops, Nigerian students, Nigerian food)
This probably goes without saying, but there are Nigerians in Edinburgh. There are Nigerian grocery shops and hairstylists in Edinburgh. Just as in places like London and Manchester, there is a flourishing Nigerian community in Edinburgh.
When I arrived at my school, I was surprised to be surrounded by Nigerians in class and at the hostel. In some ways, it felt like I never left Nigeria. Ironically, I have learnt more about Nigeria in Edinburgh than I ever learnt in Nigeria.
Having a community of people who can relate to my perspective is refreshing. I’ve made some great friends here who are simply amazing.
Side note: I’ve also made friends from other countries; trust me, it’s not as hard as it seems.
I’m loving my time here in Edinburgh, and getting that nice abroad weight gain (no exhibits here). I’ll share more about my life in Edinburgh as time goes on. Let me know any specific things you want me to talk about😊.
I’ll try not to disappear for too long next time. Thank you for your constant support and patience. I love you guys!

Since 2016, Edinburgh council has slowly been rolling out on-street storage for cyclists. In the last year, the number of hangars has doubled from 100 to over 200.
64% of Edinburgh households live in flats, and we know that finding somewhere to store a bicycle is one of the more important barriers to people moving around on two wheels. With about 300,000 people in capital in such a predicament, and with 6 spots per cycle hangar… you can do the maths.
One hangar location near Stockbridge has 142 people on the waiting list.
It is therefore not a surprise that the new hangars are massively over-subscribed. The waiting list has grown to 3,400, including those in the queue for an existing hangar and those who have requested one.
This latent demand for cycling is being realised, and in a big way. As new hangars go in they become a visible part of our public realm and more and more people become aware of them.
As things stand, the council will need to install a further 560 hangars to meet demand. Over 1,000 people joined the queue in the last year or so; if replicated this year, that’s another 170 hangars required on top of that.
Yet the council only has plans for around another 160.
Each cycle hangar takes up the space taken by one car. Parking permits are a significant source of revenue for the council. But so are cycle hangars…
At full price, a cycle hangar spot costs £72 per year. That compares favourably with car parking, which is either free in most of the city, or £36.50 for a zero carbon emissions car (except in the very centre of the city, where it’s £73.70).
Taking that £36.50 figure, each hangar will generate 12 times as much revenue as a car parking spot. That doesn’t take into account maintenance costs of the hangars, but after all the negative externalities associated with cars… it’s a good investment.
Indeed, if the council were a private business, they’d push those prices up even higher to meet demand.
Cycle hangars have been so far placed in the more prosperous parts of the city; Marchmont, Newington, Bruntsfield, Portobello — you get the picture. This is efficient work from the council as most of the demand for the cycle hangars is located in these areas.
However, conscious of the social inequity of providing such infrastructure in only the richer parts of town, a number of hangars have been located in areas of high deprivation. Even better, these are provided at a subsidised cost of only £1.50 a month.
This has not been successful. Some of these hangars are those few that have not been populated by bicycles. It is my view that the barriers to cycling for those on the lowest incomes remain the relatively large capital investment associated with the bicycle itself. The low cost and low risk associated with Lothian Buses’ excellent service is difficult to beat.
An interactive map of hangars, waiting lists and demand can be found here: LINK
This article has been based on a Freedom of Information request to Edinburgh City Council, which you can find here: LINK
While there is precise location data for existing hangars, requests for hangars are made on a street-by-street basis. I have used the postcode associated with each street and used the centroid of that postcode area to map requests.

I stood at the gated entrance on Candlemaker Row of the 16th-century Greyfriars Kirkyard. The wind whipped the leafless trees, and the sky threatened to rain. The weather was suitable for exploring a graveyard, especially one that proclaims to be the most haunted graveyard in the world in one of the most haunted cities, Edinburgh, Scotland.
Although I had not been there before, there was something familiar about the place as soon as I walked in.
It was my second visit to Edinburgh, and this time, I returned in January when the hordes of tourists were gone. I had seen the city’s most well-known sights, like Edinburgh Castle, Holyrood Palace, and the Royal Mile, which left me free to explore lesser-known places.
Greyfriars Kirkyard piqued my interest as I read a list of suggested things to do in Edinburgh. The graveyard was established during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots, and was full of victims from the Black Plague and the witch hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries, in which around four thousand…

Last time I lived in Edinburgh it was 1993. I moved there with a bunch of friends after university. As you might expect from a group of people who’d spent more time in the pub than in the lecture theatre, none of us had managed to get a proper graduate job.
It was the middle of a recession so we figured we’d go hang out in Edinburgh, continue the party lifestyle, do some temp work and maybe even find a job to make our parents proud.
At that time no one had heard of She Who Must Not Be Named, although funnily enough 1993 was the year that she moved to Edinburgh. She’d already sketched the outline for the Harry Potter books but in 1993 J.K. Rowling began writing in cafes such as Nicolson’s (now Spoon) and no doubt was influenced by the city’s history and architecture.
Our Edinburgh at that time revolved around nights out at indie and alternative clubs like the Mission in Victoria Street, Evol or FBI in the Cowgate, various pubs in the Grassmarket and around the University, live music at the Preservation Hall or the Ensign Ewart and visits to the many art galleries and museums (all of which were free).
We’d walk all over the city and I truly loved it. But all good things come to an end, and…

Hello again from my work world developing a new ten-year fund for communities in Edinburgh to work together as part of a wider system to work in regenerative ways to get deep into the root causes of big issues in our city— poverty, racism and climate change.
I’ve never written as consistently about one topic before — this is my 15th blog in a series about developing Regenerative Futures Fund, with another 4 in there about Funding Utopias.
In April 2024 my writing was about Inching Closer to Launch, closing off and reflecting on our wonderful co-design groups.
In September 2024 I mused about Good Hosting, Floating and Anchoring, when I was feeling grateful for all who supported the more ‘behind the scenes things’ — WHALE Arts, EVOC and Foundation Scotland.
And then more recently I reflected on working with poets on our Collective Imagination programme and our beautiful poetry anthology All That Is Needed Is A Dream.
So — here is my more general Regenerative Futures Fund update for the second half of 2024 and first part of 2025🌿

Edinburgh’s charm is so idyllic, it’s been a muse to writers for centuries. It’s only fitting that this is where the Kimpton Charlotte Square sits, a serene hideaway, full to overflowing with everything needed for a romantic escape. I recently stayed two nights there on a wedding anniversary tour of Edinburgh where I found four reasons why this hotel is the most romantic in the city.
Follow the author to be notified when new luxury travel articles are published.
Close your eyes and imagine a scene from a classic piece of literature (one of the cheerier volumes). What you dreamed up likely comes very close to the Kimpton Charlotte Square. A wicker basket props up black Mary Poppins umbrellas next to a stately Georgian door. Red bicycles fitted with silver bells patiently wait for their next outing on a herringbone tile floor. A dancing fire in a massive stone fireplace warms the room and the mood. A couple chats animatedly in the library and garden greenery weaves its way from the outdoors in, bringing a taste of a summer garden with it. This was what greeted us as we explored the common rooms on our first night. Even story settings don’t get as romantic as this.
On our second night, we decided to take a dip in the indoor swimming pool. There’s nothing like a spontaneous swim, taken purely for fun (with no attempt to get a workout in) to bring up memories of the exciting first rush of love. Do try it.
When the day draws you and your love outside, Edinburgh is at your feet, literally. Kimpton Charlotte Square is in New Town (built between 1767 and 1890 while Old Town is medieval). Shops full of Harris Tweed tartan handbags and beautifully packaged shortbread biscuits, plus one-of-a-kind treasures are two to ten minutes away on foot. Edinburgh wasn’t bombed as badly as London was during WW2, so the gorgeous period architecture is laid out in unbroken ribbons along the city’s cobbled streets. The baked goods in Edinburgh are second-to-none. If you’ve never tried chocolate and caramel-topped millionaire shortbread, you haven’t lived. Don’t miss out; it will transform your expectations of dessert forever. Cabs or buses are plentiful when it’s time to go to Old Town. Or, if you don’t mind a very scenic walk, Old Town can be reached in about 20 minutes on foot. As you’re bound to get distracted constantly by fabulous shops and scenery, plan for more.
Discovering a tin full of goodies in the room was my first delightful foodie surprise. Rich chocolate bars and well-chosen savoury snacks fed my habit of late-night snacking on both nights of our stay. Even better was dinner on our second night. We ate our fill at BABA, a restaurant that feels like the best version of a Middle Eastern bazaar. BABA is a vibrantly hued maze of open areas that buzz with conversation, and intimate tables framed with heavy velvet curtains, made for a quiet meal. My hummus and pita bread was so wonderful, I nearly skipped to dessert. I’m glad I didn’t though, as the cod with grilled celeriac and cashews was tender and flavourful. My husband had the pork with red pepper ketchup, feta cheese and banana chilies, which he must have loved as he cleaned his plate.
For variety, there are two other restaurants on-site, Aizle (featuring a six-course tasting menu) and The Garden, a scenic, light-filled café that serves coffee and sandwiches until 3 PM.
After dinner and a day of exploration, I craved a hot shower and soft bed. I got both in our beautiful one-bedroom partitioned suite that overlooked the front steps of the hotel and Charlotte Square beyond. The suite’s sitting room and bedroom are separated by a partial wall under a high ceiling. Of all the room’s brilliant décor, I liked the drawing of wily rabbits best — its outright whimsy juxtaposed nicely with the downy velvet drapes and refined upholstered sofa. The super king bed’s duvet was so nice — crisp, spotless, and had just the right weight. Snuggling under it while watching TV and reliving our day surrounded by a beautiful room full of beautiful things was wonderful and terribly romantic.
As I write this, I want to go back and package up the room to bring home and make ours, but I suppose the fantasy needs to stay in Edinburgh where it fits to tailor-made perfection.
The Kimpton Charlotte Square is a fantastic hotel in a city that falls in my top three world-wide. I particularly recommend the hotel to couples looking for a romantic getaway as it is the most romantic hotel in Edinburgh. Tip: For access to the best selection of room types and seasonal specials, book directly on Kimpton Charlotte Square’s official website.
It wasn’t until I caught sight of the building that I realised I had been a guest of the hotel before, years ago. At that time it had another name. I am delighted with the improvements Kimpton has made. I liked the hotel very much before, but it is even better now, particularly in the areas of interior design and cuisine. Kudos to Kimpton!
My gratitude to Naomi Cameron of 3x1 for expertly arranging my time at the hotel. Thank you, Naomi! You’re a credit to your company.

On my way out of Edinburgh I stopped for my final EB in the land of kilts, sporrans, and Harris Tweed. My suitcase was bulging with Scotch Whiskey miniatures, a framed picture of puffins, and a natty little hat that would absolutely suit the Canberra winter, but not the Scottish Summer.
I was catching the train from Edinburgh Station down to Guildford to see my Dad before flying home to Aussie. Being so close, six hours of trains, I couldn’t possibly pass up the chance to pop in. My train wasn’t until 11am, so PLENTY of time to feast first.
I had seen the menu in the window a few days before on one of my walks and decided it looked like the sort of place that would either do a really good EB or monumentally stuff it up by trying to be too innovative.
I was seated in a booth with a brass topped table, and green velvet seats which I sank into. Looking around, there was nary a hard chair in the joint. Even the wooden dining chairs had a plush cushion to rest the weary buttocks.
I ordered a latte, orange juice, and classic Eggs Benedict that included Ayrshire Smoked Bacon, Toasted Muffin, Poached Eggs, Hollandaise Sauce. The menu kept it simple, so I thought, it going to be plain and simple.
It wasn’t, of course it wasn’t. I was in the Grand Cafe. They had the date on either side of the name. 1905. The chandeliers sparkled. The stained glass was clean. The stairs marble.
It came on a hand-turned ceramic plate, with spotlessly clean, shiny, cutlery (flatware, for the Americans). Baby spinach and toasted onion flakes adorned as garnish. The sauce, while pale, WAS HOUSE MADE!
Hallelujah.
I’ll be honest. I devoured it. It looked appetising, smelled fabulous, and tasted tangy with lemon as the acid in the sauce. The eggs, which I forgot to photograph because I was too busy scoffing them, where cooked to perfection with golden yolks and no egg snot.
After I had eaten, I used a few drinks mats to write some tanka about my Edinburgh stay. A couple of days before I had bunked off the conference to go and see some wildlife in the wild.

When you walk the charming cobbled streets of Edinburgh’s Old Town, it’s easy to fall in love with the history. The gothic spires. The storytellers. The whiskey.
But beneath your feet lies another version of the city — one that most people don’t talk about unless they’re on a ghost tour.
One that’s still very much alive in its own way.
Welcome to the Edinburg Vaults, a network of stone chambers built in the late 1700s beneath South Bridge. They were meant for businesses and storage. But the vaults were dark, damp, and poorly ventilated — so they were quickly abandoned.
But not forgotten.
Soon after, the city’s poorest moved in. Families without homes, criminals, the sick, the unwanted.
People lived — and died — in these cold, airless rooms.
Disease spread quick. Murders went unnoticed.
And when the authorities eventually sealed the vaults, many believe they buried more than just stone and wood. They buried people alive.

Liberal Arts Blog — Friday is the Joy of Art, Architecture, Design, Film, and All Things Visual Day
Today’s Topic: Edinburgh: Raphael, “The Holy Family,” Velazquez “Old Lady Frying Eggs,” and Church “Niagara”
Last week, Vienna. Two weeks ago, Stockholm. Three weeks ago, Moscow. This week, Edinburgh — as we continue the tour of European art galleries to which I have never been. The first of today’s picks is from the Italian Renaissance, the second from the Spanish Golden Age, and the third from the Hudson River School of mid-19th century America. Experts — please chime in. Correct, elaborate, elucidate.
RAPHAEL (1483–1520) “The Holy Family with the Palm Tree” (1506)
1. What is most striking about this scene is the prominence of Joseph.
2. Most Holy Family scenes have a focus on Jesus or Mary.
3. Can any experts provide any enlightenment on this score?
NB: Raphael is most famous for “The School of Athens” — one of four frescoes in the “Stanza della Segnatura” in the Apostolic Museum in the Vatican in Rome. Tragically, he died young, allegedly from too much sex, on Good Friday, 1520, which was, according to Vasari, also his birthday.
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Raphael_The_Holy_Family_with_a_Palm_Tree.jpg
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael
DIEGO VELAZQUEZ (1599–1660) “Old Lady Frying Eggs” (1618) — “chiaroscuro” and photographic realism
1. The eggs look like fried eggs from a distance but if you look closely you will see that they are swimming in a liquid and are probably better described as poached.
2. Case study in “chiaroscuro” — “with a strong light source coming in from the left illuminating the woman, her utensils and the poaching eggs, while throwing the background and the boy standing to her right into deep shadow. Here the chiaroscuro is very intense, so much so that it would be impossible to see the wall at the bottom of the painting but for the basket hanging from it; it simultaneously manages to combine the murky darkness and high contrasts of light and shadow with the use of subtle hues and a palette dominated by ochres and browns. The composition is organized as an oval with the middle figures in the nearest plane, thus drawing in the viewer.”
3. “The realism is nearly photographic and shows everyday plates, cutlery, pans, pestles, jugs and mortars, capturing the special shine on a glass surface and the light’s play on the melon carried by the boy. The boiling pan is particularly well-captured, with its reflections and the whites of the eggs. Velázquez also worked particularly hard on the detail of the two figures’ hands.”
NB: Velazquez was the great painter of the second half of the “Spanish Golden Age” (the “Siglo de Oro”) under the reign of Philip IV (1605–1665). El Greco (1541–1641) — was the master of the first half under Philip II (1527–1598).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Woman_Frying_Eggs
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez
FREDERICK CHURCH (1826–1900) “Niagara Falls, from the American Side” (1867)
1. Church was a member of the “Hudson River School” of American artists. Their theme was “sublime” nature and the “awe” it inspires.
2. Nothing captures this theme better than Niagara Falls which became a metaphor for the “manifest destiny” of the United States.
3. This is Church’s largest painting (8 feet by 7 feet) and the only one of his paintings in a European collection.
NB: Church’s most influential rendering of Niagara (from the Canadian side) was painted ten years earlier. See second link below.

That the love of typewriters is a thing, becomes evident from Somsubhra Banerjee’s article that inspired this one. Such passion for outdated technology does not come naturally to me. Yet, I came to appreciate the charming appearance of typewritten verse in 2022 after my visit to Typewronger Books in Edinburgh, Scotland.
It was not love at first sight. I slowly descended the steps to an unpretentious-looking bookstore’s entrance. In true Harry Potteresque style that is so characteristic of Edinburgh, Scotland, the “entrance” gave away absolutely nothing. I might as well have opened what looked like a basement door and found myself in Diagon Alley on the other side!
Little did I know, that I would spend the next two hours with family rummaging through entertaining accounts written by independent writers, some graduates of the University of Edinburgh’s famous creative writing programs, and many other intriguing but unknown gems. Well, that shouldn’t be surprising in the world’s first city designated as a “City of Literature” by UNESCO.
It turns out that this bookstore specialises in selling, but also repairing old typewriters. That someone would take the pains to get an old dysfunctional typewriter repaired for a cost sounded absurd to me.
The book wizard at the front desk was kind enough to share snippets of how many writers still prefer to write on typewriters. Or how he has a typewriter there which when my daughter click-clacked, would generate a tweet! And, how he had sold metres and metres of books as “home office decoration” during the great golden age of Zoom (2020–22)!
What fascinated me the most, however, was how captivated I was with all the typewriters they had on display. Turquoise, mint green, plain white but also the classic grandfather typewriters — black with black keys and golden alphabets etched on them.
Since that rainy afternoon, seeing typewritten words on the paper now mesmerises me. Those stark black and white angular letters seem to have a personality of their own. Have you read verses of poetry that just feel more alive on Instagram because they are typewritten? There is magic in them. If I can now see it, could this be some kind of literary spiritual awakening I underwent at Typewronger?
Typewriters haven’t gone completely out of fashion despite their more sophisticated and user-friendly competitors such as laptops and tablets. Surprisingly, they have held on to their niche and achieved cult status. It makes me wonder if some part of our current less efficient, cumbersome, but infinitely more charming and deeper way of writing, will unexpectedly preserve itself despite the advent of easier, lazier AI tools. Anyway, I digress…
It makes me wonder why. Perhaps, a typewriter, the way it feels to exert your fingers on its keys and the resulting click-clack sound allows a writer to feel like a music composer. After all, music is just a more mystical form of writing, isn’t it?
Or does it allow her to take on the identity of Hemingway, or perhaps, Anne Lamott, as types away? Similar to the purpose a bottle of rum would serve, or perhaps, an old, white, soft-beyond-description t-shirt. Is it a getting-into-character exercise for literary minds? Or does it evoke nostalgia for a lost, golden era of literature that she painfully tries to access, but only through its relics — typewriters?
Who knows? Do tell me if you give writing on a typewriter a shot one fine day. And if you were to bust it, you now know where to get it repaired!

It is Festival season in Edinburgh. Tens of thousands of visitors have flocked in the city, from everywhere, many from abroad. The streets are crowded, buses cannot keep to their schedules, and most people react to the misery of long queues and delays cheerfully. I think there is the acceptance that if one wished to live in one of the most civilised cities in Europe, there must be a small price to pay. Coming out of the Assembly, where I had been to watch The Life and Times of Michael K, based on J.M.Coetzee’s novel, it was nearly 3.00 p.m. and I had not had lunch yet. So when I reached the bus stop just outside the Central Library, my heart sank when I saw a long queue waiting. I checked the electronic indicator, and was not surprised that it was not in operation, and therefore had no information about how long a wait there would be. An elderly lady, a sprightly nonagenarian, next to whom I found myself caught the little grimace I made, and nodded at me in sympathy, and I thought that to pass the time, one could indulge in a little conversation. You’ve been to a show, ma’am? I asked. Her eyes twinkled, as no doubt she too welcomed a chat to pass the time. No, she responded, but she was at the Usher Hall last night to catch that Korean orchestra playing Mozart. Was it good? I asked. It was superlative, she said, but had more to say.
‘I marvel at these people who are open to an alien culture and produce such excellent work,’ she said, ‘and ask myself, What do we know of Asian culture?’ Yes, I responded, the Koreans, like the Japanese and the Chinese, are excellent interpreters of Western classical music. Had I seen any good shows this year? She asked. I told her about Michael K, and added that I too had seen a delightful Korean opera, Trojan Woman, and said that it was one of the best shows that I had caught in the last few years.Yes, she said, they are a very cultured people. I then thought I should pay her a compliment.
‘I am surprised and pleased that you think so,’ I said.
‘But I was born in Penang,’ she blurted out, ‘my father was district officer in the thirties.’ And she told me that she had lived in Malaya until she was twelve, and then spent time in Jakarta as well. To my surprise she revealed that she used to be fluent in bahasa. My son was in Bogor for two or three years, I said, teaching TEFL. I had to add that my father too had spent time in Indonesia in the twenties.
Suddenly her eyes lit up again, and she said, ‘Oh I have to tell you this, it’s so marvellous.’ She had been shopping, and when it was time to pay, realised that she did not have her purse any more. She was upset and panicking, and to her amazement a young fellow came towards her brandishing her purse, which he had picked down the road. ‘Aren’t people marvellous?’ I had to tell her my own story of how, travelling from Lagos to Kontagora, a 15 hour journey I realised that I too had lost my purse.
‘I informed the driver, and he made an announcement, and someone stood up and walked towards me with my purse. Is it yours?’
‘So you must have travelled a fair bit too?’ I nodded, and told her that I came from Mauritius_’
That’s where the dodo came from?
The dodo and me, I added facetiously.
‘Oh,’ she asked suddenly, I know it’s a stupid question, but seeing you come from Mauritius, do you know dentist Chong Kwan? He used to be my dentist until last year when he sadly passed away.’ I had heard the name in Mauritius, and besides I remember my dentist brother talking about a dentist Chong Kwan. I figured out that her dentist Chong Kwan must have been the son of my brother’s colleague.
And I filled her in on what I had done since I came to the UK in 1959. Then a Number 27 bus appeared.
‘Now that I’ve been enjoying talking to you, I’d have been happy to wait some more,’ she said. Although I was quite hungry, I agreed with her.
‘Hope we can find seats together,’ she said, ‘because I’ve been enjoying our talk.’
Sadly, as the bus was fairly packed, she found a seat in front and I at the back. It seemed like an anti-climax, but two stops down her neighbour alighted, and I was able to move in with her. We continued together until Tollcross, where we both got out, she having decided to walk home, whilst I too tired to walk opted for another bus.
‘I’ll look out for you, and you do the same, we’re bound to meet again,’ she said cheerfully.

From Abuja to Edinburgh: my 1st semester experience as a Mastercard Foundation Scholar at the University of Edinburgh,https://medium.com/@mirabellemorah/from-abuja-to-edinburgh-my-1st-semester-experience-as-a-mastercard-foundation-scholar-at-the-80b3fc2ec550,"Sign up

This will humorously walk you through some of my experiences these past 3 months as a Scholar, from settling into Edinburgh to being blown away by heavy winds. See the end for scholarship application tips.
My first few weeks in the UK were both exciting and uneasy.
The Mastercard Foundation team at the University of Edinburgh have been incredible and helpful in everything. Once I got the scholarship, they guided me in applying to the university, gave travel guidance (before arriving) and helped me settle-in (on arrival).
Before I moved to start my postgrad, the past months were not easy. I experienced an armed robbery attack in the middle of the night (funny part in hindsight was that the first thing I hid was my passport). I went from that to being exhausted in the months that followed, to overthinking, etc. So arriving in Scotland, jumping into a new environment, new system and getting used to the pattern and methods of postgraduate lectures were not things I immediately settled into. It took two months for my beating heart to calm down. As they say, it’s not (only) the situation that makes you unhappy; your thoughts about it count.
I’ve explored several places in Scotland. We had a calming retreat at the Burn in Glenesk, Brechin. I visited the University of St. Andrews to watch a Rugby Match (both courtesy of Mastercard Foundation). Then I visited Glasgow to spend an evening with Gerry Higgins (Social Enterprise World Forum’s founder), his family, and Maeve Curtin.
Before Edinburgh (UK), I’d already visited circa 12/13 countries, but I’ve never been used to the transport systems of many places. So I’m slowly learning (because I walk to most of my destinations) to use Edinburgh’s public transportation, from trams to trains to buses.
As a Nigerian, you know all that hassle of looking for how to convert your naira to USD and how to buy stuff on Amazon or pay for some Apple subscription etc? Nah! That stuff is hectic abeg! It was a relief to get a multi-currency card in the UK that allowed me access different currencies. I could use a Revolut card to buy groceries in the UK with GBP and use it in the Netherlands to move around in EUR. Nice stuff.
An imaginary bank card I designed for “Bank of Womandla”. This was inspired by my course on Entrepreneurial Finance as well as one of my professors, Francis Green who encouraged us to imagine borrowing from “Bank of Francis” to fund our business ideas.
Using MTN? Remember to keep your MTN line. Here’s how.
You must find your own way of learning and dealing with course load. My postgraduate studies are on innovation and entrepreneurship, and before attending lectures and seminars, I need to read several papers. Some things that help me are to:
“This presentation was led by a fantastic first speaker who really nailed the presentation of the pitch. Ably supported by the second speaker, the pitch presentation was authoritative and slick. The video was really helpful in that it showed that attention had been given to how the pitch was to be presented…”
– Part of the academic feedback we received
Naturally, the Mastercard Scholars programme is already a HUGE community and network. The Foundation’s team organises several leadership lab sessions for scholars to learn. A Chevening scholar once attended an end-of-year event I co-organised with Kish (my fellow scholar representative) and said he liked the community we had amongst us. I’ve always believed in the power of mutually connecting with people beyond my studies, learning from others, sharing knowledge and strategically showing up for things.
So far:
I’ve been in the UK for 3 months. I haven’t seen snow in my part of Edinburgh (yet). The wind has tried to blow me away several times. I don’t know how to use a vending machine yet. I make better illustrations now. I’m better at making business valuations. And one of my favourite actions remains to keep asking more questions.
I am a huge advocate for rest. I budget heavy doses of rest and sleep in between all of my hard work. I believe in “less is more.” I believe in prayers and mindfulness. I believe in play, and in disconnecting to recharge.
P.S. for the title, no I didn’t live in Abuja. I flew out of Nigeria, from Abuja to Edinburgh.

Hi there! It’s good to see you here.
This photo is exactly where I am now — an uphill climb to see as much of the world as possible. Yet, some places capture me instantly when I arrive. Edinburgh, the city and its people, is one of those. While I write short posts with photos, this one is a longer read with even more pictures and will be in several parts.
My daughter and I decided to visit Scotland. I knew I needed a month, but because of our schedules, I only had a week. At first, our plans involved a rental car and too many stops until I realized I only wanted to see Edinburgh on this first trip. Thanks to my daughter, we enjoyed our trip, and I hope to return to a different location in Scotland at least every other year.
The city exceeded my expectations. Why? I felt immediately at home. If you’ve read my other posts, you know that a city’s vibes either make it for me or not. I have no idea why I feel the energy in things, people, and places, but I do. Edinburgh, for me, is calm and reassuring. Not so in London (as I will discuss in a later post), where we’d just left. There, I feel discombobulated. My brain hears English being spoken but doesn’t feel at home. I anticipated the same thing in Scotland, but thankfully, it didn’t happen.
We took the train from London into Edinburgh Waverley, in the city’s heart. The station is magnificent. After looking at the bus routes and getting tips from our apartment host, we decided to walk to our apartment. I’m glad we did. Here are some scenes along the way.
Our Airbnb in Marchmont near The Meadows had a lot of light, even on a somewhat gloomy day like the one above. Our flat had two bedrooms and two baths, with windows in both bedrooms, a necessity for us both. We had a pleasant morning visitor every day who watched us eat breakfast. The apartment was stocked with things to eat related to Scotland, which was a nice touch.
Our hosts at the apartment we rented in Marchmont were fabulous. They provided transportation tips and suggestions for food, even meeting with us to have a beer and a chat and answer all my questions. (I cannot get Scottish citizenship because of UK rules. They don’t like older adults, it seems.)
The Meadows is a large park near the University of Edinburgh. The paths through the garden were the easiest way to reach most of the places we decided to see daily. Edinburgh has a decent bus service, but we used our feet to take it slow and see the city center on this first trip.
We were in the city the week after Fringe, the year of a garbage workers’ strike, and our Airbnb hosts were apologetic about the city’s look. Having frequented New York City, I was surprised at how clean this city was, even amid a garbage strike. All the people, whether tourists or residents, kept the garbage in the taped-off areas with signage, and the rest of the city was kept clean.
Our landlord insisted we could not visit Edinburgh without a trip to Holyrood Park and a hike up to Arthur’s Seat. Up to the challenge (well, my daughter more than me), we set out for the hike up the hill the next day. It was worth it for the scenery alone.
If you’ve never been to Edinburgh, the main downtown area with tourist attractions is easy to wander. We began at the Palace of Holyroodhouse and walked up the Royal Mile to Edinburgh Castle, stopping in shops after lunch in a small cafe, then visiting one of the cathedrals.
Even with the level of tourists at the end of the Fringe, it was a pleasant walk without the usual hassle of packed streets and impatient tourists.
Here are more photos; I’ll have more in the next post.

I’m writing this as I realize how these memories are ones I never want to forget
In 2022, during my study exchange in the UK, I finally had the chance to explore one of my dream destinations: Edinburgh. Even though it was a short trip — just two days — visiting Edinburgh was a dream come true. I don’t know when my fascination with Edinburgh began, but I’ve always been drawn to its charm. I would often find myself lost in Pinterest searches, captivated by images of its small alleys, the rain-soaked streets, the gloomy and moody weather, and the warm tones of autumn. Without any clear reason, I’ve always felt like I belonged there.
Naturally, when my friends and I were planning our reading week itinerary — a break that happens before exam week — we decided to include Edinburgh. It was a spontaneous choice but one that made perfect sense. So, where do I begin?
We set off from Windermere (District Lake), bound for Edinburgh Waverley Station. By the time we arrived at the station, it was already quite late. We took a city bus to the nearest stop to our accommodation — the West End Hotel. However, we still had to walk at least fifteen minutes to get to the hostel. Tired as we were, the walk through the cool, dimly lit streets of Edinburgh was exhilarating. The city felt alive, even at that hour, with its historic buildings and the crisp autumn air. As I stepped off the bus and set foot on Edinburgh’s cobblestone streets for the first time, I let out a deep breath. Finally, I thought, I’m here.
It was 23:56 GMT on the 1st of November, 2022 — a special time when the time returned to GMT, just as BST had gracefully ended with the last Sunday of October.
When we got to our hostel, we were expecting a spacious room. We had booked a room with two bunk beds, and the pictures from Airbnb made it look roomy enough. However, as it turned out, the room was — it was cozy but — far from spacious, it was so damn narrow! Let me explain: there was just one small (literally small idk the size but it really small I bet you) room with two bunk beds, each with three levels, which meant six beds in total. There was only one bathroom for six of us to share. Imagine, there were five of us plus one stranger — a man who was already half-asleep when we arrived. But despite all that, the hostel was pretty clean.
With our suitcases and tired bodies, we made quite a racket as we tried to figure out who would shower first, given that we all felt too damn stinky after our journey. I’m pretty sure our new roommate woke up, even if he pretended to sleep through our commotion. Sorry, bro, didn’t mean to be so noisy — we’re just tourists, after all.
The morning of November 2nd greeted my birthday with its own special charm — a veil of gloom and a soft, persistent drizzle. The sky was overcast, casting a muted, gray light over the city. It was the kind of weather that could make a city feel both cozy and melancholic. Despite the drizzle, we were determined not to let it dampen our spirits or waste any precious moments of our time here, so off we went.
Our first stop was Tesco, a short ten-minute walk away to pick up breakfast and I chose a cheese sandwich and a bottle of mineral water. The simple act of grabbing food felt like a small victory against the gray weather, fueling us for the day ahead.
With our breakfast in hand, we headed to our first destination: Dean Village. The village’s enchanting streets and picturesque landscapes offered a warm contrast to the dreary weather. We meandered through its cobbled paths and admired the historic charm of the old buildings, their facades softened by the rain. For about 40 minutes, we explored every nook and cranny, each corner revealing a new facet of the village’s beauty.
During our exploration, I took a moment to video-call my sister, she was studying at the library and ran outside when she heard I was in Edinburgh. She showed her excitement and called to wish me a happy birthday.
After a few photos and a chat with my sister, we continued our journey through Edinburgh. With no tight schedule or set itinerary, we allowed ourselves to drift through the city center, embracing the spontaneous rhythm of our exploration. The drizzle continued, creating a soothing backdrop to our wanderings.
The wind, however, proved to be a formidable challenge. It was so strong that when we tried to use our umbrella, it turned inside out in a comical twist of fate. We laughed at the absurdity of it all, the umbrella flapping helplessly against the gusts. Despite the weather’s attempts to thwart us, the experience was exhilarating and added a memorable touch to our day.
As we strolled through the city’s streets, we ended up at Ross Fountain. Ross Fountain evokes a sense of elegance and charm. The fountain’s ornate details and vibrant colors make it a striking focal point against the backdrop of Edinburgh’s historic architecture. Our each step was accompanied by the gentle sound of rain and the occasional burst of wind. The day’s weather, though dreary, felt like an integral part of the city’s atmosphere, enhancing the adventure rather than hindering it. It was a perfect start to my birthday in Edinburgh.
Without realizing it, noon had arrived. We decided to seek warmth from the chilly drizzle and stop at a Thai halal restaurant. The cozy atmosphere was a welcome refuge from the damp weather, and the warmth of the restaurant felt like a comforting embrace.
The restaurant, with its inviting ambiance and delicious food, provided a perfect break from our explorations. We enjoyed a hearty lunch, savoring the flavors, sharing stories and laughter. Unbeknownst to me, my friends had ordered a dessert and marked it as a birthday cake. It was a simple gesture that added a touch of magic to my already-sweet birthday. The dessert, with its rich and sweet taste, felt like a cherry on top of an already memorable day.
After lunch, we set off to explore another part of Edinburgh. Our next stop was Victoria Street, a vibrant and picturesque area known for its colorful buildings and charming shops. One of the shops we wandered into was a Harry Potter-themed store, where we soaked in the magical atmosphere and picked up a few souvenirs. We also took some photos of the rainbow arching across the city, adding a splash of color to the gray day.
As we explored, we lost track of time and soon noticed the sun began to set. The weather took a turn for the worse, with heavy rain and strong winds making it uncomfortable to be outside. We decided to take shelter in a nearby Mexican restaurant. Inside, it was just the three of us and the waitress. She gave us a complimentary cup of tea as a thank you for helping her get in the chairs and tables that got wet outside.
Meanwhile, our other two friends had different plans and had set off for Birmingham. As we waited for the rain to pass, we enjoyed burritos and relaxed in the warmth of the restaurant. The meal and the shelter provided a pleasant pause in our day, allowing us to regroup and watch as the day turned to dark. Then we decided to head back to the hostel. We were freezing and tired but ended up waiting about an hour for a city bus, and it took another hour to get back to the hostel.
Day two in Edinburgh began quite differently from the first. It was November 3rd, 2022, and the morning was bright and windy, the opposite of the previous day’s gloomy drizzle. It was also our last day in the city, so my friends and I decided to take it easy and enjoy a leisurely morning stroll in search of coffee.
We found a charming little café, Patisserie Florentin, near Circus Lane, about a 20-minute walk from the West End Hostel. I ordered a hazelnut latte and a cookie, a perfect start to the day. The warm coffee and sweet treat felt comforting, especially with the crisp morning air around us. After got fueled, we wandered around Circus Lane, snapping photos of the picturesque alley with its beautiful scenery. The small, charming street was filled with quaint houses and vibrant plants, making it a perfect spot for capturing memories.
Not too long, we headed to the Royal Botanic Garden to enjoy the fresh air and greenery. We spent about an hour strolling through the gardens, taking in the peaceful atmosphere. The morning was quiet, with a gentle breeze blowing through the trees, the sun was shining, making everything look vibrant and full of life. Not to forget, I bought a unique souvenir from the garden’s shop — a glass aromatherapy bottle featuring a gold tree design on a white background. It was a beautiful reminder of our time in Edinburgh, a keepsake that captured the serenity and beauty of the Royal Botanic Garden.
Feeling satisfied after wandering around the vast, peaceful garden, we made our way to the heart of Edinburgh — Princes Street. We returned to take in the sight of the iconic Scott Monument, a towering Gothic structure that never failed to impress. I found it to be the perfect spot for people-watching.
As we meandered, I could hear the beautiful instrumental music played by a street artist, adding a melodic backdrop to the lively scene. People strolled by, chatting and laughing with friends, their voices blending with the music. I noticed an elderly man sitting on a bench, engrossed in his newspaper, while others sat nearby, absorbed in their books. Some people rushed by, possibly late for work or trying to catch a bus, their hurried footsteps echoing on the pavement. There were also fellow tourists like us, with bright, curious expressions, taking in the sights and sounds of the city.
The streets were busy, full of life and energy. It was a perfect blend of the everyday hustle and the charm of a city rich in history and culture. Standing there, surrounded by the vibrancy of Edinburgh, I felt a sense of connection to the city and its people.
As we strolled down Leith Street, we stumbled upon Maki & Ramen. The sight of the steaming bowls of ramen was too tempting to resist, so we went in. The ramen was delicious — warm, flavorful, and exactly what we needed. And don’t worry, if you’re vegan or need a gluten-free option, you just need to inform the friendly staff about your dietary requirements. And for Muslim visitors, they offer Halal-certified chicken and beef dishes. As their slogan goes, “Vegan? Halal? Gluten-free? No problem. At Maki & Ramen, inclusivity is key.”
After enjoying our meal, we realized we didn’t have any set plans for the rest of the day. So, on a whim, we decided to head to Calton Hill. It only took us about four minutes to reach the entrance from Regent Road, where we began our hike. Yes, hike… but I think it’s worth it as Calton Hill is known for being one of the best places to visit in Edinburgh, and you know… it’s free.
The hike wasn’t too strenuous. Just four flights of stone steps and an uphill walk, making it a pleasant and manageable climb. It was a good bit of exercise, and we were rewarded with spectacular views of Edinburgh. From the top of Calton Hill, we could capture some of the most iconic photos of the city, including the breathtaking view of the Old Town. The panoramic scenery was worth every step, offering a perfect blend of Edinburgh’s historic and natural beauty.
There were so many things to explore at Calton Hill. As we walked around, we admired the impressive Playfair Monument and the towering Nelson Monument, which provides a stunning 360-degree view of Edinburgh if you climb to the top. We also visited the Collective Gallery, a center for contemporary art that showcases modern works in a historic setting. One of the most iconic sights was the Dugald Stewart Monument, a beautiful structure that stands out against the skyline, offering a perfect spot for taking photos.
Calton Hill isn’t just a place for great views; it’s rich in history too. The hill has been a significant site in Edinburgh for centuries, with its origins as a place of gathering dating back to the 16th century. It became a public park in 1724, making it one of the oldest public parks in Scotland. The various monuments on the hill, like the National Monument, are built to commemorate significant historical figures and events. For instance, the Nelson Monument was built to honor Admiral Horatio Nelson’s victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. The hill has long been a symbol of Scottish Enlightenment, representing both historical remembrance and cultural progress.
Exploring Calton Hill gave us a deeper appreciation of Edinburgh’s rich history and culture. We spent hours wandering around, taking in the sights and enjoying the peaceful atmosphere. It was a perfect way to wrap up our visit to Edinburgh, combining breathtaking views with a sense of connection to the city’s past.
Before we knew it, time gently nudged us to leave, pulling us from the embrace of this enchanting city. With a mix of reluctance and contentment, we made our way to the intercity bus bound for Glasgow, and from Buchanan Station, we set off back to London. As the bus moved away from Edinburgh, I took one last look at the city that had given me so much in such a short time.
These past two days were a vivid collection of memories — unexpected moments, stunning vistas, and cherished times with friends. Having my birthday here, in the city I had long dreamed of, turned a simple trip into a profound experience. I am deeply grateful for every second, every shared smile, and every view that left me breathless. This was a birthday to remember, and Edinburgh, with its rain-kissed streets and storied hills, will forever hold a piece of my soul.

Perched majestically on Scotland’s eastern coast, Edinburgh is a city that seamlessly blends its rich history with vibrant culture and ever-changing weather. From its ancient roots to its modern-day charm, Edinburgh offers a captivating tapestry of experiences that enthrall visitors from around the world.
Edinburgh’s history is woven into the very fabric of its streets, buildings, and monuments. Dating back over a thousand years, the city has witnessed the rise and fall of kingdoms, triumphs, and tribulations of its people.
At the heart of Edinburgh stands its most iconic landmark, Edinburgh Castle. Perched atop Castle Rock, this ancient fortress has stood guard over the city for centuries, its towering walls holding the secrets of Scotland’s past within its stone embrace. From its beginnings as a royal residence to its role in countless battles and conflicts, Edinburgh Castle is a testament to the city’s storied history.
The Royal Mile, a cobbled street that stretches from the castle to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, is a living museum of Edinburgh’s past. Lined with centuries-old buildings, including the striking St. Giles’ Cathedral and the imposing Parliament Hall, the Royal Mile is a treasure trove of historic sites and hidden gems waiting to be discovered.
Edinburgh’s cultural scene is as diverse and dynamic as the city itself. From world-class museums and galleries to lively festivals and events, there is always something to see, do, and experience.
Every August, the city comes alive with the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the world’s largest arts festival. With thousands of performances ranging from theatre and comedy to music and dance, the Fringe showcases the best of international talent against the backdrop of Edinburgh’s historic streets.
But Edinburgh’s cultural offerings extend far beyond the August month. The city is home to a thriving music scene, with venues ranging from intimate pubs to grand concert halls hosting performances by local musicians and international acts alike. Art galleries, such as the Scottish National Gallery and the Fruitmarket Gallery, offer a glimpse into the world of Scottish and international art, while theaters like the Edinburgh Playhouse and the Traverse Theatre provide a stage for cutting-edge drama and entertainment.
One cannot speak of Edinburgh’s weather without mentioning its well-known unpredictability. Like its cultural offers, the city’s climate is diverse, ranging from intense sunshine to unexpected downpours.
Summer brings long days and mild temperatures, perfect for exploring Edinburgh’s outdoor attractions, such as Arthur’s Seat and the Royal Botanic Garden. Autumn paints the city in hues of gold and crimson, while winter transforms it into a winter wonderland, with the Christmas markets and Hogmanay celebrations adding a festive air to the city streets.
But it is perhaps in spring that Edinburgh truly shines. As the city awakens from its winter slumber, the parks and gardens burst into bloom, filling the air with the scent of flowers and the sound of birdsong. It is a time of renewal and rebirth when Edinburgh comes alive with the promise of warmer days ahead.
Edinburgh is a city of contrasts: ancient yet modern, traditional yet progressive, unpredictable yet endlessly captivating. With its rich history, vibrant culture, and ever-changing weather, Edinburgh offers a unique and unforgettable experience to all who visit its storied streets. Whether you’re exploring the historic landmarks of the Old Town, immersing yourself in the excitement of the Fringe Festival, or simply watching the clouds roll in over the Firth of Forth, Edinburgh is a city that never fails to leave its mark on the hearts and minds of all who wander its winding pathways.

Heading into Edinburgh on the tram, I couldn’t help but feel that I had missed the memo that the Fringe had a dress code and that it was hiking gear.
Everyone around me was wearing a backpack over a waterproof coat and hiking trousers or jeans. The weather forecast had predicted rain, but I felt more like I was heading into the mountains than the centre of a major city from the attire of the crowd. I stood out rather a lot with my skirt and handbag.
I had little experience of arts festivals, but I had expected there might be some more interesting clothing choices. I would have to wait until I reached the Royal Mile to find the more experimental outfits.
Disembarking on Princes Street, my companion and I decided to stroll around Princes Street Gardens before heading up to the Royal Mile. This park offers possibly the best view of the castle and how the rock on which it sits rises steeply up from the comparatively flat gardens below.
It’s well worth a detour to see the memorial to Wojtek the Bear who served in the Polish army during World War II. No, I’m not joking. After the war, Wojtek accompanied his comrades to Scotland. They feared a return to Poland would see him used as propaganda by communist authorities, so he lived out his days in Edinburgh Zoo, where he died in 1963. The memorial depicts him with his caretaker Peter Prendys and features scenes from his life.
We then followed the stream of people heading up the steep street (rather appropriately named The Mound) to reach the Royal Mile, the historic street which runs from the Scottish Parliament Building up to Edinburgh Castle. The railing separating the Gardens from the street was covered in posters advertising acts performing at the Fringe. The sheer number of shows was quite impressive — how could the city have enough venues for all these acts to perform daily, I wondered.
One poster in particular caught our attention: the title “Swamplesque: the burlesque parody — uncover all the layers” printed above an image of a woman painted green and dressed like Shrek. I can’t vouch for the quality of the show, but it certainly did a good job at standing out from the crowd of other adverts.
Once we had completed the climb, we were greeted by a group of young people in blue jumpsuits who were stood on traffic bollards and giving a rather lacklustre performance of Uptown Funk. Although this was amusing at first, once we returned to the area a bit later in the day and found they were still singing only this one song on repeat, I started to wonder if they were driving business away from the cafés and tourist shops nearby. The singers weren’t bad, but their trombone player’s performance left a lot to be desired. And who wants to hear Bruno Mars all day anyway?
We crossed the Royal Mile and headed downhill again along George IV Bridge to visit one of the city’s essential tourist stops: The Elephant House. The café opened in 1995 and soon became famous as the location where J. K. Rowling wrote the early Harry Potter books. The business has really capitalised on its link to the author (and who can blame it?), styling itself the “birthplace” of Harry Potter and catering to the tourists who flock to Edinburgh for the city’s somewhat loose connection to the series — although Rowling lived and wrote here, the novels do not take place in the city.
This hasn’t stopped a whole industry giving Harry Potter tours and selling Harry Potter merchandise from developing in the city. I’ve observed the same phenomenon in Cambridge, a city which has even less to do with Harry Potter. This technicality doesn’t seem to prevent tourists enthusiastically spending their money on fake wands and Hedwig keyrings. It’s rather telling that there are Chinese and Spanish versions of the café’s website, as this is hardly the norm in the UK.
Sadly, the café was recently damaged in a fire. But, for now, tourists can visit its second location, which is just around the corner on Victoria Street, a picturesque lane lined by brightly coloured shop fronts. When we arrived, The Elephant House had a rather conspicuous crowd around the entrance, making it hard to miss.
Popping in to have a look at the new location, we were greeted by Harry Potter merch and a takeaway menu that had certainly changed since Rowling frequented the café in the 90s.
Patrons have to head upstairs to reach the café proper. Despite it not yet being 30 minutes since the café opened, there was already a queue. The patrons didn’t seem to care that this wasn’t really where Rowling wrote Harry Potter as they passed the time posing for photos.
We decided to find somewhere without a queue and headed back up to the Royal Mile to Deacon’s House Café. This historic café was almost unchanged from when we had visited several years ago, only much busier with the Fringe crowd.
The ground floor of the café was once the workshop of Deacon Brodie, an 18th-century gentleman by day and head of a gang of burglars by night. Brodie’s double life supposedly inspired Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.
The wall of the café is decorated by a mural which depicts scenes from the novella alongside significant episodes in Scottish history while the courtyard offers a quiet spot just off the bustling Royal Mile for a cup of tea and a cake in classic British fashion.
It was while walking down the Royal Mile that I finally saw the eccentric outfits I had been expecting. The streets around St Giles’ Cathedral were packed, tourists stopping to watch an eclectic range of performers.
While gazing up at the impressive St Giles’ Cathedral, I heard someone behind me say, “it’s like Midsommar.” Turning around, I saw what he meant: a group of young women in long white dresses and flower crowns were flailing in slow motion in the centre of the street. One was even sat on the ground and caressing the cobblestones.
The usual street performers were also out in force. As we stopped to look at a living statue painted in silver, we could hear a shout of “this next one is Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls” from a busker around the corner. Looking up at the church, I wondered whether the street had been this chaotic in the days when the Scottish Reformer John Knox preached there.
We found our path blocked by a crowd so large that I had to stand on my toes and strain my neck to see what they were watching, since all I could see was the top half of a man wobbling from side to side. It turned out he was balancing on a ladder, wearing a kilt and holding juggling clubs in one hand. It seemed we had arrived just as he had paused his act to address the crowd.
After asking how many of the crowd weren’t from the UK and receiving a lukewarm cheer in response, he went on to lecture us all on how much he loved immigration and how bad fascism is. I imagine anyone who had just wanted a nice day out to forget about about the depressing state of modern Britain would have been sadly disappointed by this reminder of the tense political situation in our country.
Perhaps I was naïve to think the political lectures would be limited to the comedy venues. Besides, what possesses a man clowning about on the street to think anyone will take his political opinions seriously is a mystery to me.
Edging past the crowd, we continued down the High Street, dodging people offering us flyers every few metres. As we turned onto North Bridge, a girl complimented me on my skirt, reassuring me that I wasn’t overdressed.
It was actually a coincidence that we were visiting Edinburgh during the Fringe. Nevertheless, it seemed a missed opportunity not to go to at least one show while we were there. On personal recommendation, we decided to give 4 Funny Feckers a chance. Since the show consists of the comedian Wes Dalton introducing four different acts, we thought it wouldn’t be so bad even if we didn’t like them, as they would only be on stage for 10–15 minutes each.
The venue was the basement of the The Hanover Tap bar. To take our seats, we had to squeeze ourselves between rows of folding metal chairs that were crammed uncomfortably close together. It was easy to understand the host Wes Dalton’s success as he bantered back and forth with some eccentric audience members. The final act, the Spanish comedian Sergi Polo, left me with a feeling of envy at how easily he could crack jokes in his second language, a feat I can only dream of achieving, despite my best efforts.
So, would I recommend visiting Edinburgh during the Fringe? Yes and no. Yes, because it’s certainly worth experiencing all the inevitable weirdness of the world’s largest arts festival. No, because if your goal is to see the city itself, you’d be much better off visiting at a time when the crowds are smaller and the hotel prices less exorbitant. As much as I enjoyed doing a quick tour of Edinburgh, my next visit will almost certainly be at a different time of year.

Posted: 12/4/2023 | December 4th, 2023
I never get tired of visiting Edinburgh. I love the enchanting cobblestone streets, the world-class whisky bars, the plethora of free museums, and arty vibe of the city (it’s the inspiration for many, many writers).
It has been Scotland’s capital since the 15th century and has a history that stretches back millennia (humans have been in the area since 8500 BCE). There’s an epic medieval castle, an ancient volcano, the historic Old Town, and the New Town (both of which are UNESCO World Heritage sites).
One of the best ways to soak it all up is by taking a walking tour. While ghost tours are some of the most popular here (Edinburgh is supposedly one of the most haunted cities in the world), there are many other tours to experience, from bike tours to food tours to pub crawls.
Here’s my list of the best walking tours in Edinburgh to help you plan your trip, save money, and make the most out of your stay!
Best Overall Tour
Learn More
This family-owned company specializes in a variety of tours of the vaults under the city (a labyrinth of tunnels that were first used as storage and workshop space for businesses in the early 17th century), and it’s the only company to offer vault tours during the day. Adult-only tours include the infamous Canongate graveyard and there are even vault tours designed for kids.
Tours start at 20 GBP.
Best Free Tour
Learn More
City Explorers runs four different free walking tours daily. Start with the classic Edinburgh Free Tour, on which you’ll see and learn about the main sights, including Edinburgh Castle, the Royal Mile, and St Giles’ Cathedral. There’s also a free ghost tour, a free Harry Potter tour, and a free New Town tour as well. Just remember to tip your guide at the end!
While those two are my top recommendations for tours in Edinburgh, here are a few more options to help you make the most of your time here:
Food is an important part of every culture. Scotland has all manner of interesting culinary delights, and the best way to learn more about them (while sampling a bunch) is by taking a food tour. Secret Food Tours offers the best one in Edinburgh. On their three-hour classic tour of Edinburgh’s Old Town, you’ll try delicacies like haggis, creamy Scottish cheese, neeps, and tatties (and learn what those even are), as well as enjoy traditional Scottish tea.
If you want to try more local spirits, you can take the Secret Whisky, Gin, & Beyond tour, which includes seven tastings of locally brewed and distilled liquors.
Prices start at 69 EUR.
Book here!
To cover more ground and get out of town a bit, take a bike tour. A Wee Pedal has several different offerings, so you can see more of Edinburgh and its surrounding countryside on two wheels. The most popular tour is the 20-mile loop tour, which circumnavigates the entire city. There’s also a 12-mile version that goes out to the rugged coastline for a more off-the-beaten-path adventure.
While rides are taken at a meandering, comfortable pace, you can also rent an e-bike for an extra 15 GBP if you’re not up for the challenge. You can also book special private tours, including one that ends at a brewery (tasting included), and a mountain bike tour.
Prices start at 65 GBP.
Book here!
If you’re looking to get genuinely creeped out, take a tour with City of the Dead. They offer several tours that go through the underground vaults. City of the Dead is also the only tour company with access to the ominously named Black Mausoleum and Covenanter’s Prison, some of the most haunted places in the world. These spots are favorites of the Mackenzie Poltergeist, considered one of the world’s best-documented supernatural entities, with hundreds of supposed encounters. It’s one of my favorite tours in the city!
Prices start at 19 GBP.
Book here!
One of TripAdvisor’s Top 10 Things to Do in the UK, the Mountebank Comedy Walk, run by Daniel Downie, an award-winning stand-up comedian, is undoubtedly the most hilarious way to see Auld Reekie (an old nickname for the city). On this tour you’ll laugh and learn not only about Edinburgh but all things Scottish, from culture to history to some famous (and infamous) people. And if you’re lucky, Daniel’s adorable dog Bonnie Prince might even join you.
Prices start at 22 GBP.
Book here!
One of the biggest walking tour companies in the UK, See Your City offers several fun tours in Edinburgh. Their best (and most popular) is the Harry Potter walking tour, on which you’ll visit the places that inspired JK Rowling as she penned her famous series (and the café where she did so). You’ll even get sorted into your Hogwarts house and get to test your book and movie knowledge in a quiz to earn points. It’s a super fun tour and a must for Harry Potter fans.
Other unique See Your City tours in Edinburgh include a Cheese Crawl and a True Crime walking tour.
Prices start at 16 GBP.

The next day we took a taxi. After dropping us at the Royal Mile the driver suggested that we take a hop on and hop off bus and the ticket would be valid for 24 hours. With this ticket we would be able to see many of the attractions there, if we were short of time.
So, we took the help of a tourist bus to visit the popular Edinburgh castle. The bus was top open, meant for sightseeing. We had heard a lot about this historic Castle, and we were excited to visit the world-famous Castle. When I read about it on various websites, I never thought I would be able to be there one day.
Edinburgh Castle, owned by the Scottish Government, sees millions of tourists each year and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
It rises above the old town from the top of the Royal Mile. Because the volcanic rock that the castle sits on rises sharply from all sides, the only feasible entrance is on the east, along the cobblestone thoroughfare that is the Royal Mile.

We didn’t know what to expect when we stepped out of Waverly Place in Edinburgh after a horrible train ride of sitting on the floor due to the rail strikes.
As we carried our bags up several flights of stairs because the escalator was broken, we were out of breath and had a minute to take in our surroundings.
To our right was a creepy, black, gothic-looking structure.
“Whoa, what is that?!” It looked like some kind of medieval church.
Entranced as we walked to our Airbnb, we stumbled upon more dark architecture. The buildings are incredible in Edinburgh and look like something out of a gothic movie.
As we trekked along, little did we know that our half-mile walk would be mostly stairs. We were lugging around our heavy bags, backpacks, and our limbs were tired from the previous days of walking.
Even though the weather was cool, we show up at the Airbnb out of breath and sweaty. Note to self: take a taxi back to the train station.
After we check in with our host, we notice the view of Edinburgh Castle from our window. Another example of the incredible architecture was just a…

When I first arrived in Edinburgh, I wasn’t sure what to expect. I’d only heard good things, but I was coming from continental Europe and to be honest, I wasn’t sure anywhere in the UK could beat the beauty of Spain, Portugal, or any other European country I visited. But Edinburgh proved me wrong!
While I only spent five days in Edinburgh, I’m already wanting to go back and for longer. This travel guide will help you fall in love with Edinburgh on your first (or next) trip to this dark academia paradise.
Edinburgh is known for many things, some fact, some fiction. It was the late Queen Elizabeth II’s favorite city, the place which inspired many iconic Harry Potter locations, and home to the largest performing arts festival in the world.
While Edinburgh has always been a worldly city, with many medieval and enlightenment scholars calling it home, the city has had its struggles over the years. Many movements against the British government sprouted up throughout the centuries and it was the central location for executions in Scotland. Talk about a deadly good time.

EDINBURGH is a beautiful city, filled with a rich history and colourful characters. It’s quite compact and walkable.
The mediaeval Old Town, which extends from Edinburgh Castle to the Palace of Holyroodhouse via the Royal Mile, is a great place to stroll about.
Here is the main tourist entrance to the castle, being guarded by a soldier of the Black Watch.
The statues that flank the entrance are of Robert the Bruce and William Wallace, who both fought against the English king Edward I in the Middle Ages when he tried to conquer Scotland. The red lion is a symbol of Scotland. The motto, Nemo me Impune Lacessit, means ‘let no-one disrespect me and get away with it’.
I wonder whether the projecting gutters at the top were used to pour boiling oil on its would-be conquerors? These included the Scots themselves when they tried to take it back from the English in a charge led by Robert the Bruce.
The statue that is on the left as you walk in, the one that is of Robert the Bruce, was created by a Scottish sculptor named Thomas Clapperton, who also has two works in the New Zealand town of Oamaru: The Wonderland Statue in a local children’s garden, and the statue that was created for Oamaru’s World War One memorial. You can see pictures of those statues here. So, that’s an amazing Kiwi link with Edinburgh Castle!
The castle also has cannons, which were last fired in earnest during the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745/46, when the castle was in the hands of the British government but the city had fallen to the Jacobites, supporters of the Stuart dynasty, which had been ousted after the death of the childless Queen Anne. It’s all very Game of Thrones.
The castle also has an impressive Great Hall as well as many other sights. These include the Scottish Crown Jewels, which no ordinary person is allowed to photograph.
You can get great views of the city from Edinburgh Castle, as in the next photograph.
There is lovely parkland just below the castle, as well. This park is called the Princes Street Gardens. It contains lots of statues, and I was very much struck by a monument to a poet of the 1700s named Allan Ramsay.
Here are some other street scenes, just to let you know that Edinburgh does have ordinary streets, after all. Though even these are pretty funky, for instance, the Old Tollbooth Wynd, or alley.
One thing I found interesting was the symbol of a deer with a cross in its antlers, which you can see on top of the old tollbooth and also on top of the building below, the Canongate Church on the Royal Mile. The statue just to the right, which looks like a real person at first, is of another poet of the 1700s, Robert Fergusson.
The deer with the cross represents a vision experienced by a saint named Hubert, who was a fanatical hunter but who, after spying a deer with a cross glowing between its antlers, devoted his life to being kind to animals thereafter.
(The same symbol appears on bottles of a German spirit called Jägermeister, meaning master hunter. The makers of Jägermeister have lately had to defend the use of St Hubert’s vision against the charge that it was an offence to religion to put it on a booze bottle. But I digress …)
Here is another interesting one. The Scots dialect, or language, is like English but full of words that are used differently. For instance, in Scots flesh is meat but in standard English flesh is what people are made of. So, ‘Fleshmarket’ looks kind of creepy to anyone who isn’t Scottish.
I also visited the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where most of the devolved Scottish government is now based. Holyroodhouse has also been a royal palace for many centuries, with perhaps its most famous occupant Mary, Queen of Scots, the queen that Elizabeth I of England imprisoned in the Tower of London and then beheaded. The great complex of Holyroodhouse includes the Queen’s Gallery, now an art gallery, with a Scottish red lion in a different pose.
I took quite a lot of photos of Holyroodhouse, or Holyrood Palace, when I was in Edinburgh a few years ago, and included them in collages for my book A Maverick Pilgrim Way. Here are some of the collages. The first photo is of another monument in the Princes Street Gardens, while the rest are of Holyrood.
This is another interesting symbol at Holyrood. It dates back to the time of the Scottish king James V (r. 1513–1542). Legend had it that only king could command a unicorn, shown duly chained, and so the unicorn was an important symbol of Scottish royal authority in those days.
Which is probably also where the all-British lion and unicorn device comes from as well. I think the lettering I R S probably stands for James (or Iames), Rex (king) of Scotland.
The Old Town is overlooked by an extinct volcano called Arthur’s Seat, from which you can get more views of the city. Here is a view of the city with the castle at the right and Arthur’s Seat at the left in the early 1700s.
The sketch is dedicated to Queen Anne, the last of the Scottish Stuart dynasty, who reigned over Great Britain and Ireland in the heyday of the real-life pirates of the Caribbean, and after whom the legendary real-life pirate ship Queen Anne’s Revenge was named.
Arthur’s seat is close to the centre of a park called Holyrood Park, which is both bigger and wilder than the Princes Street Gardens, a large area of raw nature in the middle of Edinburgh, though it was on the edge of town in Queen Anne’s day.
Here is a video of my rambles through the castle, the Royal Mile, up Arthur’s Seat, and in front of the Palace of Holyroodhouse, which was unfortunately closed to the public this time around because of Covid. But you could still watch the changing of the guard.
The nearby New Town has that name because it was laid out in the eighteenth century, which is new by Scottish standards.
The New Town has lots of parks itself, and grand circles and squares. It served as an inspiration for Washington DC and also for the New Zealand city of Dunedin, a name that means Edinburgh in Gaelic.
Edinburgh is also a city of great learning. This fact, along with the ancient Greek or Roman-style architecture of much of the New Town, caused the city to be nicknamed ‘the Athens of the North’.
In a similar vein, Calton Hill, which sports several monuments, is known as Edinburgh’s Acropolis.
When I was in Edinburgh a few years ago, Aunty June and I went to the castle at that time as well. We visited the St Margaret’s Chapel, part of Edinburgh Castle, built in the twelfth century and one of the oldest surviving buildings built in Edinburgh.
I have lost count of the number of times I have visited Edinburgh Castle, but let me tell you it never ceases to amaze and thrill me.
My grandmother had told Aunty June stories about how she, when she was a child, used to go to Edinburgh Castle and swing on the gates. I stood at the same gates for a little while and imagined what it would have been like for my grandmother to swing on them.
On that earlier visit, I also went to the Fringe Festival held annually in Edinburgh, which I loved. The Fringe Festival began in the 1940s as an add-on to an official, but rather stuffy, festival of the arts held in Edinburgh. The Fringe Festival showcased the acts that didn’t make it into the official Edinburgh festival. It soon acquired the reputation of being the more interesting place to hang out!
So, Edinburgh isn’t all old stuff by any means!
When I was there the previous time, I also went to the port district of Leith, where my grandmother was from.
This time around, things were a bit different. As I mention up by the video, Holyroodhouse was closed because of Covid.
You have to book online to get into the castle, as the numbers are restricted for the same reason. They told me at the castle that they let two hundred people in every half an hour, and cap the numbers at four hundred, and don’t allow more than five thousand in a day. Which I thought was a very good policy.
I’d never seen the Royal Mile so empty, even though there was a cruise ship in town.
In fact, the comparative absence of tourists was why I scaled Arthur’s Seat this time around, for the first time. It had always been too busy before.
Finally, car parking in Edinburgh is an absolute nightmare. I think I ended up paying about forty pounds for the day because I didn’t get in before eleven o’clock, and thus missed out on early-bird deals. Parking a bit further out of town and using public transport is a much better idea, if you are organised enough.
In my next post, I visit the Cairngorms National Park and Inverness!

The village of Glencoe, Scotland is known for its incredible hiking, nature and landscape. However, if you fly into Edinburgh (as many tourists do) you will quickly realize that it, along with the rest of the highlands, are pretty hard to get to. Specifically, it takes around 3 hours to get to Glencoe by car and almost 4.5 hours via public transport. Renting a car is expensive and taking public transport restricts your schedule to that of trains and buses.
On my recent trip to Edinburgh I faced this conundrum — I really wanted to do a day hike, however, I did not want to deal with renting a car and driving all the way to the highlands. This is when I discovered The Pentlands. A hilly nature preserve located just 20 minutes from Edinburgh city center, these hills (or maybe even mini-mountains) are perfect for a day hike without much planning. If you want incredible views of Edinburgh along with the surrounding Scottish countryside The Pentlands are a great option.
While I am definitely not the resident expert on The Pentlands or other hikes near Edinburgh, I want to provide a guide based on my own experience. The following guide is purely anecdotal and illustrates steps that are specific to my travel style. That being said, hopefully it is still helpful in some way. I really did not see many guides on hiking the Pentlands available online when I was looking to get there — hopefully this clarifies some things!
While staying in Edinburgh I tried to research the closest entrance point to the park from the city. I found that Midlothian Snowsports Centre in Hillend provides a more lowkey trail entrance. If you’re staying in Edinburgh city center this entrance is only 23 minutes by car and at the time of my trip cost me only 10£ by Uber. If you’re looking for an even cheaper option the number 15 bus line to Easter Brush stops directly at the Snowsports Center and runs fairly frequently from Princes Street in the center of the city. Either option is great, just make sure you have a plan to get back into the city after your hike (I will talk more about this later)!
So when I finally got to Midlothian Snowsports Centre I was pretty confused on how to actually get into The Pentlands. After some searching I spoke with the desk clerk at the Snowsports center and made my way over to the right of the building. Up that direction is a very inconspicious trail head gently sloping upwards into the park itself. While its very easy to miss, its totally worth the climb! Below is an annotated map depicting the entrance, as you can see its to the right and very lowkey.
As you can probably see in the photo above, the entrance trail was nothing more than a dirt road running up into the rolling Scottish hills — perfect! Its worth noting that this entrance path splits into two options: one steeper and one more gradual, both incline to the top of Caerketton Hill (in the background horizon of the photo). I really enjoyed this part of the hike, the view just kept getting better and better.
Now i’d be lying if I said this was an easy uphill walk. While I did take the steeper path, i’d definitely be prepared for a workout! The view are really super worth it — you can slowly see all of Edinburgh spread out below you.
Honestly pictures don’t do it justice. At Caerketton Hill peak you can see the vast majority of The Pentlands sprawled out ahead of you. To get to the top of Caerketton Hill it definitely takes ~30 minutes, which really isn’t bad if you want some incredible views of the city and the rest of the park. If you’re like me and need a few hours of walking to be satisfied you can continue to follow the trail deeper and deeper into the Scottish countryside; however, if you’re done you can just as easily turn back to the snow center and get a beer in the city.
Here’s the view facing away from Edinburgh (and deeper into the park itself). You can totally see the long sprawling trails the seem to go on forever. You can also see some pretty cool sheep that I tried to pet, but they were clearly not interested.
Now above is route that I took through the park. Overall I highly recommend planning your exit strategy ahead of time. In general I found that this route was a perfect mix for adventure/direction for me. The majority kept me on trails climbing and descending the rolling hill, while the end added a bit of spontaneity to my journey.
What do I mean by spontaneity? Well, I did not exactly plan my trip back into Edinburgh. This got me stuck crossing private fields and a military base to actually make it back to the main road (A702). While the views were still awesome (see below), I only recommend it if you’re up for an adventure. If you want a more legit route you can easily circle backwards to the snowcenter or continue further on.
There really aren’t any towns along A702 in the location that this spit me out at. Because of this, I recommend bringing a phone with plenty of charge to call an Uber back into the city. My phone was dead at this point and I ended up hitchhiking back to the nearest metro station.
Overall I think my entire hike took ~4.5 hours so I was able to leave around 9:30 am and be back just in time for lunch. Not bad for less than a 30 minute ride. Next time I go to Scottland, I really hope to checkout the Highlands, however, if you’re limited on time (like I was) I recommend checking out The Pentlands! If you made it here, thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed my story/guide.

At the end of May, I spent some time in Edinburgh exploring different parts of Scottish history. During my days in the city, I visited three places:
So, here is everything I wanted to share from my trip, starting with Mary King’s Close.
Mary King’s Close
Mary King’s Close was a real close in Edinburgh until the Edinburgh City Chambers Building was built on top of it between 1753–1761. They did this by removing the top floors from the houses and built the foundations on the lower floors, so the close is underground, but when it was a residential area, it wouldn’t have been. The last resident was called Andrew Chesney, a saw maker. He lived with his wife Margaret until 1897, when they were forced to move due to the Royal Exchange buying the area for extension purposes. However, Chesney was still able to work on the Close. Then in 2003, the public were able to go on guided tours around the close after Continuum Attractions opened The Real Mary King’s Close.
The close’s name was taken from a resident of the close: Mary King, who lived in the close from 1635 (when it was documented that she was a resident) until her death in…

One of the things I do when visiting a place I’ve never been is look at the real estate for sale. As a retired real property attorney from the U.S. who has a passion for real estate, it’s just something that I do. If I’m really into the city, I will check out neighborhoods and look into what is available in the areas I find.
That is how I learned about Dean Village. It’s a tourist destination, a popular place, I learned on Instagram. The photos below will show you why. For me, it was simply adjacent to a neighborhood with apartments that looked like somewhere I would live. Given several places to check out, we started from Marchmont and headed to the Village.
We discovered the Water of Leith Walkway once we crossed the bridge in Dean Village, trying to find a shortcut to an apartment I wanted to see. There were few tourists on the path, and we found a calm, relaxed place to enjoy in the city’s heart.
I could live here. (No, we didn’t look inside nor at the price.)
We strolled the city over the next few days and found a bookstore, other pubs, and city art that we liked. The bookstore appealed to me for its proclamation and selection of books that most stores don’t bother carrying.
I needed food at that moment, and this pub had good food. I learned that most pubs in Scotland do not serve food-they are only bars. This is different from London, where we’d just been.
Ah, another book. Well, I’m a writer. What do you expect?
Will I return? I already have plans. The landlord will challenge me to RUN up to Arthur’s Seat this time, I’m pretty sure.
For all the photos of Edinburgh, visit my website.

First, the poem: It’s called Edinburgh’s Hills
Once there was a town they called Dun Eidieann.It was built around a castle on a hill.The town grew south and east and west but not northBecause of what was at the bottom of the hill.
So they built an artificial lake out of that bottom.And then threw trash and even bodies down the hill.And Loch Nor soon became a sewer.So they drained the lake and built an artificial hill.
Then they went to work on building Georgian New TownAnd placed their monuments on Calton Hill.And then they thought they would extend the Glasgow railroad.So they tunneled through that artificial hill.
It took a million carts of dirt from New Town To build The Mound, that artificial hill.Then they built the National Gallery of ScotlandAnd planted shrubs and trees on their new hill.
Now people congregate at New Town’s GardensAnd gaze at the fort on Old Town’s hill.Then they walk the Royal Mile to the castleAnd look down at New Town from Castle Hill.
2. And now, the pictures:
We would leave our New Town hotel at Picardy Place every day and walk up Leith Street, passing two giraffes on our left and the St James Shopping Centre on the right.
Shops were closing in 2016 and the old shopping centre was about to be demolished while the new shopping centre was being constructed. It’s called St James Quarter now but back then its name was Edinburgh St James.
Sometimes we dawdled along Princes Street. At other times we just walked across North Bridge over Waverly train station to reach the Royal Mile in Old Town.
On the Royal Mile we examined the shops and the bars and the street performers.
The Royal Mile runs from Edinburgh Castle on the western top of the hill to Holyrood Palace at the eastern bottom. It’s pretty much a straight line on top of the ridge but the street names change from Castle Hill to Lawnmarket to High Street to Canongate.
One day we walked to the top of the Royal Mile and visited the Castle and the National War Museum of Scotland and admired the views of Princes Street and New Town.
On yet another day we visited the National Museum of Scotland in Old Town and then had lunch at the Elephant House nearby.
J.K. Rowling wrote most of her first Harry Potter novel at the Elephant House.
In the above photo, New Town’s Princes Street and the Scott Monument are on the left. In the background, the Balmoral Hotel is to the left of North Bridge and the buildings on the right are in Old Town. North Bridge connects to the Royal Mile about halfway between the Castle and the Palace.
Uh-oh, I think I am getting farther behind other writers involved in this challenge. I better get going on the letter F! But first I am going to check out the latest A-Z stories by Sam Millichap, Adrienne Beaumont, Michael Rhodes, Anne Bonfert, Jillian Amatt - Artistic Voyages, Robert G. Longpré, Nishan Fuard, and Darren Weir.

We visited Scotland in 2016, dividing our time between Edinburgh and Glasgow. When I mentioned our plans to my sister Betty, she recommended that I take a look at a series of novels about a wealthy woman named Isabel Dalhousie who lives in Edinburgh where she edits a magazine on ethics and on the side gathers her group of friends together, usually on Sundays, to solve murder mysteries. She calls her little group The Sunday Philosophy Club, which is the title of the first book in a series that has now reached 17.
The Isabel Dalhousie books are the product of a rather prolific writer named Alexander McCall Smith, a noted legal scholar who was born in Botswana (when it was called Rhodesia) and became an expert on medical law. McCall Smith moved to Edinburgh in the 1950s when he became a professor of medical law and bioethics at the University of Edinburgh. He decided to become a full-time writer in 2005 and he still produces three or four books a year. Some of them are children’s books, some are detective series (The № 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency, 44 Scotland Street and a few others), and some are academic textbooks. And he manages to crank out an Isabel Dalhousie mystery just about every year.
Edinburgh was once divided into two parts. We have the Old Town on the hill with Edinburgh Castle on the top and the Palace of Holyrood House on the bottom. In between is the Royal Mile where all the tourists hang out. University students, too. Then we have what is called New Town which is mostly north of Old Town and is mostly flat. New Town is almost as old as Old Town. Princes Street, the main street in New Town, is at the base of the Old Town hill and runs parallel to the Royal Mile. Modern Edinburgh has spread out in all directions from Old Town and New Town.
Isabel lives in Bruntsfield south of Edinburgh’s Old Town. We resided on the eastern edge of New Town during our week-long stay in Edinburgh. Every day we walked westward to Old Town and the Royal Mile. We never walked as far as Bruntsfield, though.
In The Sunday Philosophy Club, she attends a concert and witnesses a man falling to his death. The police say it was an accident. She thinks he was pushed. The Sunday group ponders over the matter, bringing up matters involving Immanuel Kant and other philosophers, and of course solve the mystery.
I only read four of the Isabel Dalhousie books, skipping # 4 through 12 and going right to # 13, which McCall had just completed prior to our trip in 2016. It is called Sweet, Thoughtful Valentine and is really just a short story and only available as an eBook. In this book Isabel ponders over a moral dilemma involving a promise she made to a friend. In typical McCall Smith fashion, she wanders to her favorite cafe on Dundas Street, then visits an antique shop and an auctioneer nearby where she meets an old friend and makes her promise. The two then ride on a bus back to Bruntsfield. The story continues with scenes involving Isabel’s niece Cat, and another friend who is also involved in the auction. We also breeze through scenes involving Isabel’s husband Jamie and their son Charlie. The climax occurs when Isabel returns to the auction house to attend the auction. No murders in this story.
Since 2016 McCall Smith has written four more books in the series. But I moved on to Spain shortly after returning home from Scotland and began reading memoirs by pilgrims on the Camino, preparing for our trip to Spain in 2017.
If I ever return to Scotland, I will probably devote some of my time to rereading some of my favorite works by Scottish authors Arthur Conan Doyle and Robert Louis Stevenson. Both had roots in Edinburgh, but Sherlock Holmes did most of his detective work in London and Stevenson’s children adventures featured Scottish heroes, but he concentrated on Europe, America and the South Seas for his travel books.
You can find more details about our trip to Edinburgh in my Crow Canyon Journal blog here, here, and here.

In contrast to my hometown of Glasgow which, said with total affection of course, can slightly give off a post-soviet energy, Edinburgh certainly looks like a capital city, as far as surface appearances go. Not only does it house Scotland’s arguably most important cultural site, Edinburgh Castle, but it’s unexpectedly a major financial epicentre; unexpectedly because it doesn’t feel like it at all. In a lot of ways, Edinburgh is more small town than big city. It’s important to note though, that this charming city of old is very clearly becoming one of the world’s major melting pots — attracting students & professionals from all corners of the world. Apparent in the recent addition of certain world-famous brands like The W Hotel to their roster of places to be. So, in the ever wise words of Miss Molly-Mae, we all have the same 24 hours— and so this is how I’d spend mine in the city of Edinburgh.
“In a lot of ways, Edinburgh is more small town than big city.”
Arriving at Waverley train station will put you slap-bang in the middle of Princes Street in the city’s New Town district. On your right will be the Balmoral Hotel housing the glorious Palm Court, in which they host Edinburgh’s (alleged) best afternoon tea.
One of many Harry Potter references in this city is that JK Rowling alleged she finished the Harry Potter series while staying in a suite in this hotel. She left a bust of Hermes in her room, upon which she inscribed “JK Rowling finished writing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in this room (552) on 11th Jan 2007” — and the room has since been known as the J.K. Rowling Suite. The bust still sits in the room, though now surrounded by a glass case. A far cry from the dribs & drabs of back-street coffee shops where it’s said she had written “parts” of the previous books in Edinburgh’s Old Town.
Speaking of Old Town, and starting with the most important meal of the day — is the city’s answer to Elan Cafe; a pink paradise just off of the city’s landmark “Royal Mile”, Laila’s. It is a brunch-y Middle Eastern fusion joint with proven classics like French Toast, and Levantine faves like shakshuka.
Edinburgh is a foodie’s paradise so a walk in between meals is a must, and there’s nowhere better than the Royal Mile, which runs between Edinburgh Castle & another notable historical site; Holyrood House. Just to be transparent, the distance isn’t exactly 1 mile but you’ll find plenty of cute jaunts along this stretch, selling traditional Scottish exports; cashmere, wool, whiskey, shortbread & tablet. My favourite is an all-year-round Christmas shop guarded by 2 nutcrackers — a great place to buy an Edinburgh-themed souvenir. Everything in Edinburgh is fairly walkable but there are hills & cobbled streets to look out for on this side of town — so sky-high Louboutins? Not a good idea.
If all that walking has made you a bit peckish, you’ll find every cuisine you can fathom in Edinburgh. However I don’t think you can go wrong with Steak Frites, and you’ll find the best at Chez Jules — 2 courses will only set you back £9.90 [yes, you read that correctly]. It speaks to the kindness & hospitality that Scottish folks are known for. Upon your entry, you’ll be given a variation of hors d’oeuvres, as if you were visiting the house of an old friend — which is exactly what Edinburgh feels like.
Another [personal] favourite is Taco Libre, “owned by Mexicans, cooked by Mexicans” — the perfect opportunity to support a POC-owned business, and again very reasonably priced, as are many venues due to the large cohort of students occupying the city during term-time.
Edinburgh, unsurprisingly, is not short of places to wet your whistle. A firm favourite for an afternoon pick-me-up is a spot tucked inside the Edinburgh Grand hotel on St Andrew Square — The Register Club. The walls are clad in wooden panelling and play to the “old world” glamour Edinburgh is loved for. I am admittedly quite bougie, so this is exactly my cup of tea. If you’re looking for something a little more lively, a stone’s throw away is Rose Street Garden, an unassuming spot & one of my favourite places to take friends visiting from outside Scotland. From here, if you’re a shopaholic you can hop along to George Street or the new St James Quarter; a one-stop-shop for everything you’d need for a day (or few) in Edinburgh; accommodation, eateries, shopping, entertainment, bars — you name it.
A defining quality of Edinburgh is the stark contrast between the different areas of the city. “Old Town” with its cobbled streets & “New Town” as a sort of cosmopolitan Mecca. Bruntsfield is a little out of the way & more residential but just as trendy, and super underrated — though I’d recommend this for a weekend rather than just 24 hours, but granted, you’ll be back. As well as a trip to the shoreside town of Queensferry. A short journey will make you feel like you’re in San Francisco [though I can’t guarantee the weather will match up] and it’s super easy to reach. Get on a 43 bus from outside the train station and keep your camera at the ready because you are not prepared for the sites on the journey.
Where Edinburgh doesn’t match up to certain qualities of other capital cities, it excels in others. The weather [usually] lacks, but the people here beam brighter than the sun. Perhaps I’m just a proud Scot, or maybe there’s something in the air. I suppose you won’t know until you see it for yourself.

I’ve never set foot in Edinburgh, but somehow, it feels like I belong there. In my mind, I stroll down its cobblestone streets, surrounded by centuries of history. There’s something about the city’s ancient charm that draws me in, where the buildings, weathered by time, seem to echo stories of old money and aristocratic elegance. It’s a place where history feels alive, woven into the fabric of every corner.
I imagine cozy, rainy days spent in small cafés, much like where J.K. Rowling penned Harry Potter, sipping a cup of hot chocolate as the mist rolls in. The city has that romantic, almost cinematic quality – a place where you can lose yourself in a quiet bookshop, or watch the world go by from a window seat, feeling at peace.
Edinburgh feels like an escape from the chaos, where life moves at a slower pace and the people are warm, inviting. It’s a place of inspiration, where every stone, every hidden alley seems to have a story waiting to be told. Though I’ve never been there, the thought of it feels like home. One day, I’ll find my way to those rain-soaked streets, to the city that already holds a piece of my heart.

We stayed in Edinburgh during the abnormally sunny month of June and we had the best time. Edinburgh has everything you could possible want in a city: gorgeous architecture, breath taking views, exquisite restaurants, cosy pubs, shops and boutiques galore and even a beach for good measure. It quickly made its way up my favourite list of cities, and I was super sad to be leaving.
Basically, Calton Hill > Princes St & George St loop >The Mound > Lawnmarket > Edinburgh Castle > Grassmarket > Greyfriar’s Bobby memorial > Cow Gate > Royal Mile. If you cover all over these places, you’re going to have a great day; great landmarks, awesome architecture, and plentiful cafes, bars, pubs and restaurants for a refreshment en route. We loved Grassmarket and it’s lively atmosphere. In summer, the restaurant tables overflow out on to the pedestrianised street area, and it’s a delight to see.
You’d never believe this beach was on the coast of Scotland. Although we were very lucky with the weather on one of the days, it’s equally as wonderful even when it’s a bit colder. It’s a large stretch of golden sand with rippling waves; there’s an adorable high street just beyond the promenade, both which are full of cafes and shops. Well worth a whole day out — we’d recommend The Velvet Easel Art Gallery on Portobello High Street, the art and jewellery in there was beautiful. We also stopped at Bross Bagel for a snack, another amazing find.
One of my favourite things to do in Edinburgh was to go a run around Arthur’s Seat and Holyrood park before work. While the way up can be quite painful while jogging (I walked a fair bit of it), the view and tranquility at the top is worth the effort. There’s a lake you pass at the top of the hill, and then you’ll reach the edge and be able to look over the whole coast. Once you reach the lake it’s either flat or downhill the whole way back, so at that point it’s plain sailing!
The views and features along this route rival any other; discover vast fields, woodlands, rivers and waterfalls, and breathtaking views across over to Cairngorns.
Dunkeld now has to be one of my new favourite towns. Not only is the high street to die for, but the pub on the river is one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever had a meal. The terrace has an outdoor bar, a large marquee, as well as copious amounts of seating, including picnic tables in and out of the marquee, sunny tables, and cute little bar stools and barrels by the river – something for everyone; you can read more about this pub/hotel in our other Edinburgh blog!
We decided to try and do a run walk to explore the water of leith. It follows the river from Leith right through the centre of Edinburgh. We discovered parts of Edinburgh that we never would have including Stockbridge (which had an open air food market called the Neighbourgood market) and also somewhere called Dean Village. Although there’s not much to do at Dean Village, the village sit upon the stream and its houses are stunning, a really tranquil place to walk through and I feel so grateful I got to explore it.
We loved exploring the views across Loch Katrine – but it would have been even better had we cycled round! There’s a wide paved path following the whole Loch round – And there’s even a bike hire centre at the car park!
Having said that it’s only because we scaled the hillside that we were able to get these amazing views, not quite so achievable on a bike!
While we didn’t actually visit Edinburgh Castle itself, we explored the surrounding area. It’s located at the end of the high street, and the closer you get to it, the prettier everything becomes. It’s also a stone’s throw from Grassmarket, a wide street made for pedestrians and pubs, filled with cafes, restaurants, pubs, shops and bars. Would fully recommend an afternoon of exploring that area, taking in the atmosphere and treating yourself to a pint and a view or two.
For a date night to remember, we recommend booking a night at the zoo. It’s an adult’s only event at Edinburgh Zoo, where you can wander round a kid-free zoo, grab a drink and a bite to eat from the couple of food stands, and even watch a bit of live music. It’s just an event they do during the summer of course. It’s well worth it! A lovely, chill atmosphere.
It’s got to be one of the most incredible things about Edinburgh, the fact that there’s a tremendously tall hill smack bang in the middle of it all. Although it’s quite a feat to climb, it’s well worth it. The views across Edinburgh in one direction and the bay in the other are spectacular.
Another breathtaking bit of greenery in the city, quite literally. Calton Hill is yet another steep trek, but again the views and the architecture are worth the effort.
One of our highlights of our time here was an Airbnb experience run by Julie — a sheep herder and her pack of dogs.
The experience began just driving there. We stopped in a beautiful hill side cafe and then carried on the drive through the most incredible valleys and glens.
When we arrived Julie warmly welcomed us, we met some sheep, and she then proceeded to exhibit her pack of working dogs — in all the various stages of training. Starting with the least experienced to the most, and then a finalé of two dogs working together.
All of her work in training is anything but tyrannical or dictatorship. Instead, she practices something she calls the ‘natural way’.
Hope to see you again really soon, Edinburgh!

The moment we entered our rental flat Roshan began exploring the whole place, and he was enthralled.
“Daddy let’s stay here and don’t want to go back to London,” he said.
All three of us exchanged looks in surprise. Was this the same kid crying non-stop about thirty minutes ago?
“Yes, this is our house until we leave this city,” said his father, holding him back from his excitement of running from room to room.
We had bought some eating stuff from Southport Morrison hoping that we may not get anything at night when we arrived in a new country. But we were wrong. Even in the night we were able to get some basics like milk, bread, butter, cheese, and some other crispy stuff for eating from a shop, very close to our stay.
After some light dinner we decided to sleep soon so that we would be refreshed in the morning to start our tour. As soon as I touched the bed, I dropped off to sleep and enjoyed a deep and peaceful sleep. I was up early in the morning.
Raindrops like slug trails trickled down the windowpane. Steely clouds hung low, heavy with more rain, smothering the town.

Edinburgh. It was a decades-long dream for this American to be there. And there I was, about halfway between Edinburgh Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse on the Royal Mile.
Alone.
The friend I was traveling with and I had just parted ways for the afternoon. She had other interests. I had to see Holyroodhouse, having read every fictional and nonfictional account of Mary, Queen of Scots, I could find over the years. Having watched every movie or program I could find. Having a general interest in history and specific interests in the British Isles.
Holyroodhouse is special to me. Even before Mary, there had been the wedding of James IV and Margaret Tudor in the abbey while the palace was under construction. Later, James VI would live at Holyrood until he became King of England and took up residence in London. So much happened here.
In between, there would be burnings and cannon attacks and repairs. Holyroodhouse has seen some things.
And I was going to see Holyroodhouse.
Alone.
That turned out to be the best part. My visit to Holyroodhouse was the beginning of my discovery of the joy of solo travel.
The Royal Mile is the road that slopes gradually from Edinburgh Castle at the top to Holyroodhouse at the bottom. It’s actually made up of several streets that run together west to east, starting with Castlehill, which runs into Lawnmarket, followed by High Street, on to Cannongate, and finally, Abbey Strand. It is roughly a mile long(an English mile) and takes just under a half hour to walk.
The Royal Mile is a busy thoroughfare, overrun by tourists and populated by colorful locals. Walking it alone gives you the opportunity to stop where you want and enjoy the view. If you’re walking and talking, you might miss some things . . ..
Like this guy playing his heart out for you although bagpipes are difficult to ignore!
This wizard floating in mid air.
This guy doing . . . his thing.
There’s always something to see on the Royal Mile, whether it’s the colorful characters or the rows of shops. So, so many shops.
But, finally, you end up here, at Holyroodhouse.
It was incredible to tour it alone, absorbed in my own thoughts. It was just me and Holyroodhouse. There were other tourists, but I hardly noticed them. I was having a moment with history, and that’s all I cared about.
Pictures aren’t allowed in Holyroodhouse, so I had to put away the potato I use for photography. (I suck at photography, and there’s no point in pretending otherwise, okay?)
Holyroodhouse is massive. You can tour parts of it online via the Royal Collection Trust. There is so much to see, from the state apartments (including the chambers of Mary, Queen of Scots) to the Throne Room and the Great Gallery. I stood at the spot where Mary’s secretary, David Rizzio, was murdered by her jealous husband, Lord Darnley, and his gang of assassins.
This spot, this murder, was the beginning of the end for Mary, Queen of Scots.
I stood there.
Outside, I was able to pull out my potato again and take some pictures of the ruins of the abbey that dates back to King David I of Scotland (1128, to be exact) and the grounds of the palace.
As I strolled the grounds (not the whole 10 acres, but some of it!), I wondered if Queen Mary had once walked where I was walking. Did she appreciate the lush beauty of the place?
Did she ever stand and admire this incredible view?
Finally, it was time to leave. My stomach was grumbling for fish and chips. (I gained five pounds on fish and chips in the UK and Ireland.)
The half hour walk back to the hotel would justify the fish and chips, so I decided to hoof it. I’m a avid walker anyway, so it seemed like a good chance to stretch the old legs, too.
There had been some instruction from our tour director about finding Princes Street if we got lost and following it and . . . more words. Who’s really listening when you’re trying to photograph Edinburgh Castle with a potato?
I set out in the direction of Princes Street. For some reason, my phone wasn’t getting any kind of connection, so I had no access to maps, and the paper one I had was kind of vague. Nevertheless, I set out confidently in the wrong direction.
Before this happened, I would have thought being lost would terrify me. I got lost in my car in the city I live in once when I was new to the area, and it was enough to keep me from going back until Google Maps became a thing. But then again, I did see a dead body on a stretcher and a swarm of cops arresting a bunch of people that day (the middle of a week day!), so there’s that.
But, I wasn’t scared in Edinburgh. Maybe it’s just Edinburgh, or maybe I’m older and wiser and more savvy now. I know what to look for and how to avoid a sketchy area, not that I saw any in Edinburgh. I’m sure they are there. As I strolled along, I realized I was relaxed and trusted myself. I was happy.
At one point, I spotted three people — two women and a young man — with a large map, so I approached them, hoping to get some directions. They stared at me nervously as I asked what street we were on. They spoke to each other — in German, I think — and looked, frankly, kind of terrified. (What were they saying? “It’s an American. Does it have a gun? What should we do?”) I tried to ask them if they knew the name of the street we were on, but I think they were even more lost than I was.
When I turned, I saw the ultimate “get unlost” solution: a tour bus driver! He was parked on a side street and vacuuming the steps of his vehicle with some little handheld thing. He cheerfully pointed me in the right direction, and off I went.
I think Edinburgh is still so vivid to me because I walked it alone, taking in every site, processing it all deliberately and thoughtfully. When there’s no extraneous chatter or other distractions, it’s easier to simply be in a place, be a part of it.
Upon finding Princes Street, I was still a bit turned around. I wanted to get some pictures of the Sir Walter Scott monument, and I knew I needed to go west. Waiting to cross a street, I asked a woman standing next to me if I was headed in the right direction. She responded that she thought so, and then said, “I’m so sorry, but I’m in a hurry, and I’m late,” before darting across the street and disappearing into the crowd.
“That’s fine. I’ll be fine,” I said because she did look distressed.
I continued on my way, still feeling happily lost and not minding at all now. If I wandered up and down Princes Street, I would eventually see the cross street that led to my hotel.
Then, I saw the woman, running back toward me, waving at me. Nearly out of breath, she pointed in the sky, “Do you see that spire ahead in the distance? Walk toward that. That’s the monument!” She turned to run off again, and I shouted “Thank you!” after her. She turned to wave, still trotting along, and I thought how kind it was of her to come back for me that way when she was in such a hurry.
And then I had my moment with Sir Walter Scott. I love Ivanhoe. His other books are good, too— the other Waverly novels — but Ivanhoe is special. I wrote about a book from my grad school studies , The Superhistorians, in another article. The author included Sir Walter Scott among his chosen great historians although books like Ivanhoe were historical fiction and Scott did take liberties with historical fact. But, he brought history to life and he did so by putting people at the center of it. He made history a riveting story.
As a history major who had been drawn to history initially through historical fiction, it meant something to me to stand before the monument to Scott and reflect on his work. It was yet another moment between Edinburgh and me.
Then it was time for fish and chips. And Guinness.
The main thing I learned from being lost on my own in Edinburgh was that it wasn’t a big deal. I have been interested in the idea of solo travel for awhile, and it seems to me there has been a explosion of interest in and information about it over the last couple of years. There are many articles online about why people are taking up solo travel, which typically include the freedom of being able to do what you want when you want with less expense, along with being able to immerse yourself fully in the experience. Solo travelers often note a boost to self confidence and self-knowledge that come with the experience. Solo travel can also be less stressful than traveling with others.
Would the imagery of the Royal Mile still be so vivid to me if I had walked it with another person? Would I have been as immersed in Holyroodhouse with someone else waiting for me to finish in a room or drawing my attention to something else? Would I have had that connection with a stranger that still reminds of how awesome human beings can be? Would I have enjoyed reflecting on the influence of Sir Walter Scott on me, a history and English major while standing before his statue?
Those memories are my own special memorie s— mine alone.
After Edinburgh, the idea of solo travel became more than just an idea to me. I now see it as something I can actually do.

Edinburgh. Known for its inspiring history, its eclectic catalogue of festivals and with it, an ever-present army of selfie-snapping tourists. (Can’t be helped, just comes with the territory, y’know.)
And whilst there are many wonderful attractions in Edinburgh, like any popular city, at times the main sights can become a little overcrowded, which isn’t ideal if you like your delights, day-tripper free.
Anyway, if this sounds a bit like you, then read on. We’ve been in touch with the locals who know this city best to put together the off the beaten track, things to see and do, places to eat, drink and generally watch the world go by.
(And to make things easy to follow, we’re going to be categorise each local tip with either EAT. DRINK. SEE. PLAY. Hopefully quite self-explanatory so we’ll get on with it…)
Dean Village (SEE. PLAY)What the locals say:
Ashley
IG: @ashleyWanders
“One of my favourite hidden gems in Edinburgh is the Water of Leith Walkway, a 20km riverside path that winds through the heart of the city. It’s a fantastic spot for a leisurely walk and a lovely natural oasis where you can go to escape the hustle and bustle (and it’s an absolute godsend if you need respite from the crowds during the Fringe Festival in August).”
What we say:
One of the most underrated scenic sites in Edinburgh. Although Dean Village is located about a 5–10 minute walk from the busy Princes Street. ‘Busy’ just doesn’t appear in Dean Village’s dictionary. What once was at the heart of Edinburgh’s manufacturing industry, the now quaint village is now a picturesque residential area, with old millstones, a temple and an ancient viaduct scattered throughout. If you follow your nose around the walkway, you’ll find the Dean Gallery and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, both free, both brilliant.
Bruntsfield (EAT. DRINK. PLAY)What the locals say:
Charlotte Ballantyne
IG: @justmuddlingthroughlife
“Edinburgh has plenty of suburbs to explore, each with their own atmosphere, to get away from the sometimes overwhelming city centre. Brunstsfield is full of local, independent shops, that’re away from the more common high street. Grab a coffee in Artisan Roast or The Chocolate Tree, browse for a new outfit in Biscuit Clothing or pick up some toys in Gulliver’s, then have a delicious meal in Three Birds or Montpellier’s!”
What we say:
Bruntsfield is a cultural hub, bursting at the seams with exciting things to see and do. The best part about it? Tourists often overlook it, which means you’ll get the chance to experience this suburb like a true local. As Charlotte mentions, there’s plenty of restaurants serving up the best local produce, there’s also no shortage of good pub grub and countless independent shops that’ll make your time in Bruntsfield a brilliant one. If you’re looking to stay out a little past your bedtime and the busy Grassmarket bars aren’t your cup of tea, there’s more than enough stylish, typically Scottish pubs and bars to wet your whistle.
The Stand Comedy Club (DRINK. PLAY)What the locals say:
Charlotte Ballantyne
IG: @justmuddlingthroughlife
“This tiny little underground venue is legendary in Edinburgh, having been the place where many world-famous comedians got their start. It’s open every night of the week, hosting both newcomers and better-established names — Monday nights are ‘Red Raw’, where any beginner can take part, with tickets priced at just £3. If you’re lucky, more famous comedians will often make a surprise appearance to test out new material, especially in the months leading up the Fringe in August!”
What we say:
Established in 1995 in the basement of an Edinburgh pub, the club has grown to become one of the UK’s best comedy venues and a mainstay of the Festival Fringe. The club is also no stranger to hosting famous acts, with the likes of Kevin Bridges and Frankie Boyle learning their trade at the venue and if you’re lucky, they sometimes pop back to practice new material. (You might also be happy to know the club has banned stag and hen parties, which mean most of the people you find there are indeed the locals and are there for a L plate free, good time.)
Stockbridge (EAT. DRINK. PLAY)What the locals say:
Iveta Zalcaite
IG: @ivetazalc
“My favourite part of the city was is Stockbridge, if you’re looking for a truly local experience; this area is packed with lots of independent shops and cute cafes. That definitely isn’t covered in tourists!”
Kieron Roulston
IG: @kieronroulston
“Stockbridge Market on a Sunday is an excellent opportunity to go exploring Edinburgh’s new town — don’t get a taxi, take a walk down from George Street via Circus Lane and take in the different character of Edinburgh’s Mews”
What we say:
Edinburgh is full of downright lovely places, but Stockbridge has to be up there as one of the loveliest. It’s stunning architecture, charming village-like atmosphere, and its abundance of local cafes and restaurants, make it popular with the Edinburgh locals. We could sit here and list the all of its main attractions, but we don’t want to be here ALL day, so our top 3 Stockbridge picks are: Inverleith Park, the Royal Botanic gardens and the Stockbridge market (Sunday only) at Jubilee garden. Do take Edinburgh local Kieron’s advice and take the time to walk down from George Street, he knows what he’s talking about.
Blackford Hill (PLAY)What the locals say:
Charlotte Ballatyne
IG:@justmuddlingthroughlife
“For stunning views of Edinburgh, skip the crowds on Arthur’s Seat and instead head to the south side of the city to climb Blackford Hill, where you’ll get incredible views of Edinburgh Castle, Holyrood Park, and all the way over the Firth of Forth on a clear day. You can take a direct route straight up and down if you’re short on time, or spend a little longer wandering through the Braid Woods nearby.”
What we say:
If there’s one thing Edinburgh is not short of its stunning views, both of and throughout the city. But a lot of the time, stunning views comes with a stunning amount of selfie sticks carrying. This is particularly true of Arthur’s Seat, which does have a fantastic view of the capital, but can get a little crowded. If you take Charlotte’s advice here and head up to Blackford Hill you’ll get amazing views and decent snaps, minus the crowds. Lovely.
Books! (PLAY)What the locals say:
Nathan Young
IG: @nathanyoung2202
“Edinburgh is home to some amazing antique bookstores; the first one to pay a visit to is Armchair books in West Port. Deceiving on first looks, once inside, it’s an Aladdin’s cave of assorted paraphernalia, soft toys and hand-written notes. If you’re looking for first editions of certain books, it’s highly likely you’ll find what you’re looking for, they offer Victorian and second hand books for most genres.
Next on the list is Old Town Bookshop, Victoria Street. This is a bookworm’s dream — with editions dating back to the 1600s and a variety of genres as well as maps and art for pickings. Summerhall bookshop features an array of varied exhibitions and events hosted there. It also has a small gallery and a café inside where you can purchase a Scottish Breakfast roll to kick off your day.”
What we say:
To be honest we couldn’t put Nathan’s description better ourselves. Edinburgh is scattered with many independent bookshops, a lot of them teeming with more than just the books. The pick of the stores would have to be Armchair books; it’s cluttered, it’s messy and its disorganised, but this makes it the best place to browse. Whether it’s fiction or nonfiction, it really doesn’t matter, there’s enough to browse that you could probably spend your whole time in the city exploring the shelves, searching for that hidden gem you didn’t know you wanted.
Dr Neil’s Garden (PLAY)What the locals say:
Sally Cholewa
IG: @choggzy
“Tucked away in Duddingston, just outside the city centre, this established botanical garden is full of twisting and winding paths lined with beautiful plants. It makes for a wonderfully secluded and quiet spot. There are often community events happening including traditional Scottish storytelling. The ‘secret’ garden even has its own curling museum as Duddingston loch is where the first official rules were established.”
What we say:
Otherwise known as Edinburgh’s secret garden, these gardens are THAT secret that a lot of the locals would struggle to point you in their direction. This stunning area is the handy work of Dr Andrew and Nancy Neil, built at the foot of Arthur’s Seat in the 60s. They’re more than just beautiful wildlife and winding paths to the locals; this serene spot is a place of inspiration, meditation and contemplation. The perfect place to plonk yourself and unwind.
Whisky, Gin & Beer (DRINK)What the locals say:

“Scotland is famous for its whisky, and there are plenty of options to sample it in Edinburgh — try a tasting in Whiski Rooms on North Bank Street, Bow Bar on Victoria Street, or Usquabae on Hope Street. There’s plenty of other alcohols produced in this country too though — take a tour of the Edinburgh Gin Distillery in the West End, or Pickering’s Gin in Summerhall. Or if you’re a craft beer fan, try Red Squirrel on Lothian Road, or St Andrews Brewing Co. on Potterrow. Edinburgh is a very international city; so expect to rub elbows with locals, expats, and a few visitors alike in most of the city’s pubs and bars!”
What we say:
Apart from bagpipes, haggis, or going one better with a deep-fried Mars bar (yes, they do exist). If there’s one thing you’re going to do in Edinburgh, it’s try some traditional Scotch whiskey, or equally, if whiskey isn’t your preferred weapon of choice, you might want a tipple of some sort. Like any city nowadays, Edinburgh has a plethora of bars and pubs to choose from. But where do you go for something different, yet traditional, that’s not heaving with tourists? You can’t argue with Charlotte’s recommendations, and here’s some more of our favourite Edinburgh drinkeries…
Jupiter Artland (SEE)What the locals say:

“Located a half hour bus ride from the city centre, and only open during the summer months, Jupiter Artland is hidden surprise for art lovers. The grounds of this old manor house have been transformed into something like an adult playground, full of modern art installations specifically designed for the park, incorporated into the landscape, which encourage you to explore and interpret as you please.”
What we say:
Most people look after their garden with a bit of mowing and the odd hedge trim every now and again. But when Robert and Nicky Wilson moved into Bonnington House, a Jacobean manor with a 100-acre estate, they decided to do a hell of a lot more. Transforming their land into a contemporary art park and gallery, showcasing work by leading sculpture and land artists.
When exploring this spectacular garden and grounds, you’ll find cutting edge sculptures and installations from the world’s best, who are given complete freedom to produce whatever they like. And due to the sheer size of the estate, escaping the crowds isn’t something that even needs to enter your mind. Like, ever. Enjoy.

Before coming to the United Kingdom, as an Asian girl, the most common cities that have been heard of were London, Manchester, and Edinburgh. However, unlike the previous two cities, Edinburgh is the city I got highly recommended many times as it will give a different impression of a United Kingdom city from London and Manchester.
This recommendation made me put it on the top of the travel list to visit instantly once I have time. When I finally know there is a chance to travel to Edinburgh, I look forward to this trip and find out why this city can earn that acclamation from people there before.
Once I stepped out of the train station, I instantly noticed why this city left such a fantastic feeling for visitors. But, of course, the first reaction that came to my mind was, ‘Am I in the United Kingdom?’.
Scotland’s capital city, unlike London or Manchester, emphasizes constructing a modern financial centre for people. The urban planning of Edinburgh has shown both the historical and contemporary image to tell its story to people who first visit this city.

Our Moscow guide Dasha traveled to the UK on New Year holidays, and here are her impressions about Edinburgh.
I fell in love with Edinburgh — the place where castles and gardens compete with whisky and beer — and actually it impressed me even more than London.
Nothing can be compared to this atmosphere of medieval times, amazing grey buildings, peaceful local life and true Scottish spirit.
This is where peace and history go to relax, and you should too. Or write a sequel to Harry Potter. Joanne Rowling won’t mind as long as you’re happy.
Set the tone for this historical adventure by plunging into the history of Edinburgh and exploring its gems. Let the story begin with… 20 fun facts about Edinburgh.
1. Edinburghers have called this area home since 7th century AD. See if you like what they’ve done to the city that is sometimes called the Athens of the North” and decide for yourself if you agree with Robert Louis Stevenson that “Edinburgh is what Paris ought to be”.
2. The massive and gorgeous Edinburgh castle is built on an extinct volcano. The last time the volcano erupted was 350 million years ago.
3. The volcano`s crater got the name “Arthur`s Throne”.
4. From the ancient times the Edinburgh castle has an unofficial name — The Key from the Country.
5. The first people on Castle Rock appeared there about 1000 years BC.
6. Edinburgh was the first city in the world to have its own fire service in 1703. But it was a volunteer fire brigade, that`s why it took a lot of time to gather people and come to the burning place before it`s too late.
7. Edinburgh is the greenest city in the UK, since there are 112 parks in the city.
8. The first king of Great Britain James I (a Scottish king James VI) was born in the Edinburgh castle.
9. The city has a nickname — Auld Reekie (Old Smoky) which was given to the city in connection with an era when a lot of coal and wood were burnt for heating and the air was full of smoke.
10. The Stone of Destiny which is kept in the Edinburgh castle is still used for the crowning of English Monarchs.
11. J.K.Rowling used to go to the Nicolson`s café during a hard period of her life and she started to write the first book about Harry Potter exactly there. Now there is a restaurant on that place called «Spoon».
12. One more literature fact — Ebenezer Scrooge from the famous novel by Charles Dickens «A Christmas Carol» was also born in Edinburgh when the author misread the tombstone of a real person with the same name. He read «Meanman» instead of «Mealman», which means «corn trader».
13. Actually people started producing whisky not in Scotland, but in Ireland in 5th century. However, there are over 100 whisky distillers in Scotland. Well played!
14. The unicorn is a national animal of Scotland, while thistle and heather are floral emblems.
15. The number of heritage buildings in Edinburgh is bigger than anywhere. There are about 16 thousands historical buildings of different epochs.
16. Edinburgh is also standing on seven hills like Rome and Moscow.
17. About 13 million tourists visit Edinburgh every year.
18. Edinburgh is an art city. Every year in August the world best concert and theater troupes come here for the Summer Art Festival. Edinburgh is the world’s number one festival destination.
19. The Princess Street Gardens is a sneaky way to move from Old Times to New Era, as the gardens break the city into two parts.
20. Royal Mile is the most famous street in the city, it was the favorite street for walk for Scottish and English monarchs.

On the way we decided to pick up some eatables for us and two more pairs of socks for me from Morrison supermarket. Since it was Christmas time the supermarket was crowded with shoppers.
Hardly an hour was spent there and despite the drizzling rain, we resumed our journey to Edinburgh.
Observing the breathtaking sceneries on both sides, and chit chatting, we passed through some beautiful places like Preston, a town in Lancashire the northwest of England on the bank of River Ribble, in Lake District.
Every object in the journey was new and interesting to all of us. Our journey continued till we took a break in Westmorland, a motorway service station, off the M6 motorway. It is a popular exit station for the travellers.
We had our food and indulged in some shopping. The items available there were all organic straight from the farms. The other items like milk, cheese etc were also from the sheep reared by the farmers. One farmer had started this shop and the food cooked by his wife became favourite of the travellers…

After Oli’s full recovery from food poisoning, we made our way to Scotland!
Back in July we toured Norway together with our friend Theresa, who flew in from Calgary. We traveled well as a group and kept bugging her to join us again on our little detour and we managed to convince her to join us for our final leg in Scotland!
We met up in Glasgow for just one night (Halloween!) and then made our way Edinburgh for some hiking, exploring and history. There was a lot to see and not enough time… Within the first 48 hours, we all agreed: this is a place we will come back and visit.
Here are our first few days together!
See more on our website www.alittledetour.ca🌏✈️👫
We left Glasgow and made our way to Edinburgh. The city is super cool and the medieval influence is very visible the moment you drive into the city limits.
We got to our Airbnb which was the biggest apartment Oli and I have stayed in during our entire year long travel! We had a beautiful view of the city, the university and the beautiful fall colours.
“Although the origin of the name is uncertain, some claim that there is a connection between Edinburgh and King Arthur. Arthur’s Seat may have been the location of legendary Camelot.” — — Earth Trekkers!
There are these areas of the old town that they call “Close” and it is essentially a square or alley that connects all the houses. They would use them to sell things — like the Fish Close, was for the fisherman to sell fish. Our tour guide told us to try and explore as many as possible.
So Theresa picked one.. and we followed her down it, but it turned out to be a rocky hallway that pigeons lived in, there was poop everywhere and they chased Maeghan right out.
We also learned about where the saying “shit face” came from. The wealthy people of Edinburgh would live on the ground level floors of the tall beautiful buildings because the top floors were a fire hazard— so locals would pay more for lower-level apartments, for safety.
But since toilets were not a thing yet… they used chamber pots and would simply yell out the window as the person was dumping them out.
Since this caused much chaos, the city put in a new rule: you can only empty your chamberpots at 7 in the morning, and 10 at night.
Problem is, 10 at night is when the pubs would close. So combine drunk people pouring out onto the streets with people pouring chamberpots out of their windows, and you can picture how you might come home after a night of drinking: shit-faced drunk.
On our last night we caught up with an old friend of Maeghan’s from Calgary. Anton homeschooled with Maeghan and we had the chance to discuss politics, homeschooling, the weather and our exotic spouses. ☺️

Scotland’s capital is one classy city. Edinburgh boasts quaint cobbled streets, many hidden hide-outs, excellent shopping, eerie dungeons and a big boss of a castle that rivals even Hogwarts. No wonder it’s famous for putting on a heck of a festival every year. Even better than that, it lasts the whole month of August, and jam-packs in so many diverse acts that the festival programme is published as thick as the phone book. The Edinburgh International Festival is the world’s largest arts festival and it’s no surprise that it attracts acts and tourists from every continent, as well as the locals, in droves. This is a city which takes great pride in its culture, where the best of the best hope to make a name during the festivities.
So don your finest kilt if you have one, embrace (don’t slate) the sounds of bagpipes, and drink Tennents until you are fully wearing your beer goggles. It’s going be one heck of a month.

This 21 mile walk from the Scottish Capital to the centre of Dunfermline is a pilgrimage of my own making. It didn’t aim for any church or holy site; instead I aimed to go see my Uncle’s artwork being exhibited in the centre of Dunfermline. Ever one to make something harder than it should be in the search for growth, I planned out how I could walk from my front door to his paintings. A week before the route was being tweaked and twiddled with, down to where I can stop for an emergency piss if the need arose. Turns out, not many people walk from the centre of Edinburgh, across the Forth and onto Dunfermline. The only snippets of adventures I could find dipped in and out of my route; but none of them were complete. Perfect, an adventure is to be had.
I am not religious, nor have I ever been, yet through walking and adventuring I have found a sense of mindfulness. A spiritual freedom you may call it. At around 10 miles I experience a deep sense of joy and zen. Runners have told me they experience something similar, but I have yet to find that point running; instead I feel every excruciating second of the bloody thing. Yet, via walking I zone into a different world, one of my own making. At mile 15 I usually land hard like a Ryanair aeroplane before bouncing up back into my mindfulness. For this walk, though, I would hit mile 20. What then would that bring me?
It’s 6:30 am and my HipHop mix alarm is sudden and loud. ‘Damn it feels good to be a Gangsta’. True, maybe. Today I’m hoping it feels good to be a Pilgrim; whatever that is. January is in full flow, but storms have passed and there’s clear cool air in the city. Not many are trundling about as I leave, espresso heavy on my stomach, at around 7:30 am. Deliveries clatter and clang into Sainsbury’s, high vis workers smash down the lorry’s back doors and floors. It cuts the crisp morning air. I begin to look forward to the promised remoteness of much of my trek. Before long I am passing a quiet Haymarket Station; it is the weekend, no commuters are jousting up and down the road today. Air is blue, the moon is full and bright against the wisps of clouds. Their fast movement across its face does not bode well for the wind later on.
Edinburgh has a fair amount of old railway lines that have been tarmaced over and converted into sheltered paths. The one I spring onto is a familiar one for me; during lockdown I would glide down here to the beach, filled with regret when I get there that I didn’t pack more warm clothes. Even in the height of summer Cramond is a windy bitch. A jogger huffs past and a cyclist dressed all in black whizzes past. My espresso gurgles and shifts; what was my toiletry plan again? I stare down at my phone like a lost tourist coming out of Waverly. A Tesco is marked at the very end of my railway route and before I dive between two golf courses. My breakfast stop. Tree’s sway and lurch in the wind as the dark blue sky turns to pink, then a light gold. The sun is on its way behind me as a veer off from my Northern path to the West.
A Tesco employee stares at my walking stick in a bit of a stunned silence as I ask about toilets. Seconds pass before he forces out a ‘No’. Not quite the spiritual guidance I was looking for on my Pilgrimage, I admit. But perhaps this area doesn’t get many wanderers this early on a Saturday. I dart off and onto a well-to-do road. Cameras, locked gates and larger financed cars come and go as I wander through. The houses get larger and more elaborate, the gates get more defensive and taller. This road is very clean, I will say. Although there seems to be no sign of life I can’t help feel eyes on me. Perhaps a Pilgrimage is a trial of sorts. This is my first one today; do not shit yourself in a posh neighbourhood. It would be caught on multiple cameras and posted online as a VR experience before I reach the Forth Road Bridge.
The road comes to an abrupt end, turning into a path which seems meagre and slim compared to the vastness of the properties behind me. I’m now sandwiched between two golf course, various signs tell me not to litter or even contemplate becoming a member; they can tell I’m not quite up to scratch by the stick I’m swaying about. A dog walker, the first of the day, looks tired and fed up. He looks up under his hat but his eyes are sunken, sad. Is it golf that has made him like this? Or the weight of owning a castle? Or perhaps he doesn’t belong here, like me, but comes to envy and depressed about the life some lead. Either way we slink past each over on this wee pathway. More big houses flank me as I pop out onto a new street, these are chopped up into flats, though. Suddenly I dive down a windy old road and into some trees. At the bottom of this glen like snake I come across a small field of ponies. It is cold and damp down here, the houses look sodden. Then, just as I’m getting the heebie jeebies I turn sharply onto a stone bridge that spans a smooth, icy cold river. I stop for breakfast.
Before me the river is escorted into the distance by forestry and steep green banks. Tops of the trees are on fire from the ever so slowly rising sun. A golden morning stabs across the landscape, splicing my view into harsh warms and glassy colds. A dog comes to inspect my backpack and the fallen crusty crumbs of my pork pie. Their walker takes no heed of me. A few minutes pass watching the silk like water flow away from me and I head off up and out of the crossing. On my left a helter skelter of a building seems to have been slapped together in a rustled puzzle box. Is it a community centre? A church? I place a bet with myself and lose it all immediately. It’s a steak restaurant; I have driven past it numerous times on the way to the bridges. It brings a nice pang of realisation how far I have to go yet, seen as though the road takes a while and goes almost directly to them. I, though, must turn hard right towards the shore. North once more, away from the city and into the Dalmeny Estate.
A large muddy puddle welcomes me into the estate via a metal gate. I spend a few seconds staring it down. I’m mile 7 into my walk. If I get my feet wet now then the next 15 will be less than ideal. I jump it and slip with my walking stick. Luckily I’m alone and swan off up the long, straight road. To my right now there is a line of soldier like trees being pierced with brilliant gold. Their shadows barcode the road before me as it stretches off into a wide left leaning corner. My left is all ploughed farm fields, topped with bushes and trees as they slope uphill. I stop to take some photos for my own personal stash of farm related memories. A country lad at heart. Snowdrops welcome me at the various twists and turns of my golden road and before long the landscape opens up wide into rolling fields. A deep warm stench of hay and manure catches the wind here and there and now I begin to see some new faces.
“Morning!” A deep, booming voice bellows at me as a runner flies past. It startles me as I’m now zoning out into my zen-like world of farm equipment and muddy trails. “You alright!” I shout back. An exhausted “Aye.” Floats back to me. A few more people, dog walkers, general walkers and runners go past and each say good morning, how are you doing, beautiful day for it. It’s a social extravaganza here in the estate. My flurry of networking peters out and I slope down into more forestry. Thin, tall pines guard the shoreline that I can see spanning the view between their dark barks. The sun has yet to reach down here. A quietness settles around me, shells appear in the muddy path. I see a small opening onto the beach and jump driftwood onto the pebbly, sandy shore. It’s wonderful. Expansive and calm with the tide out, the sea is a far off foe I will conquer later in the day. For now it offers a definitive end to my Northern direction. Cramond Beach to my right is busy with people, but they are distant and seem to be across a dreamlike void. Cramond Island sits amongst the warm light of the morning, ships moving slowly behind it; their bright red hulls a stark brush stroke on an otherwise fair, cold view. I sit on the driftwood and stretch my legs. Silence. A swish of leaves above me as a gust of wind hits. Nothing. A leaf rustles onto my trainers. I cry, just a little.
On my walks I often cry, or get to a point that holds me to a tear or two. Sometimes it’s the silence, the calm. Or sometimes it’s a memory spurred from what I’m seeing, what I’m thinking or what I’m hearing. This Pilrimage has a density heavier than most due to death itself, which hit my family from all sides in all ways in 2021. For reasons I’m yet to really figure out myself, I have never posted about it on socials, or anywhere, really. A percieved lack of permission from who knows who, or a unwillingness to put any of it to solidified, permenant digital ink? I do not know, but I will say, on this walk I carried everyone with me, every step.
I’m just about to hit mile 8 and this is where my first tear drops of the day. But what a view for it to happen to. I spend longer than I probably should watching the world, not really do much. Voices behind me in the woodland break my train of thought. Runners coming up through the path I’m yet to tread. I look left expecting, foolishly, to see the red arches of the rail bridge spanning the water. Nothing in sight. I have a long way to go. Fife taunts me slightly as I dive back into the woods, it knows I’m coming for it. But it also knows how many trials I have to face on my wee Pilgrimage.
Shortly I see a bright square of stone drawn onto the curving coastline through the woods. Above it is a bright blue sky with textured clouds. The sun hits it hard, bright. A castle of light stone sits proudly upon the sandy waters of the Forth. But it is a way away yet. I trundle on through beautiful woodland, red trunks vear up to swaying canopies. Sometimes the sun strikes in and searches out the shining shells and sand that pop up here and there. Now and again a fallen tree crosses my path. Some old and mossy, some new and yet to be traversed properly. I cross a rolling stream of turquoise as it tumbles down into the grassy banks of the beach. It guides me along its shore before it spits me out onto another expansive view of the beach. This time there are less pebbles and more shimmering sand. My guide curves its way down to the sea through the banks. Following it with my eyes it leads me to the castle, now much closer. Mile 8 done. There’s an Eminem joke in there somewhere.
Green grass mixes with yellow sand like a paint palette. I pick up speed. My surroundings have me excited with this adventure. Castles, beaches, forests and farms. Dalmeny House solidifies my enjoyment as it pops up, looming proudly on my left. Vibrant, flat green grass rolls right up to its walls. It is a set piece, a view with a view and it stops me in my tracks. But the magic falters. Seemingly it is being renovated, or gutted. Ugly metal fences hug it horribly and metal work pokes out here and there. Windows boarded, taped. A pile of shite on it’s flanks. No matter, I have the castle I have been walking towards for the last few miles. My bright stone castle on the water. Once I get to it the magic falters again. No Entry. Fair enough. But, it too is boarded up, closed off, hiding. Recent work is obvious, but it is a shy place. Seaward it stands out and proud, but us landlubbers can only catch glimpses as it peers through shrubbery and trees. Perhaps I need some energy or water because my mood takes a bit of a dip. The next two miles are a slog, they are cold and my golden sun disappears for a long while. Where the hell are the bridges?
Maybe that was one of my trials of my Pilgrimage, a featureless forest that seems to never end. More likely it is my need to have a little rest and some food. Luckily the red metal work of the Rail Bridge begins to appear between the leaves. Then I find an opening and stumble down a muddy bank to a bunch of rocks. Perfectly there is a large fallen tree that acts as a seat. I sit, eat and admire the view. The Forth Rail Bridge spans across the water right before me. South Queensferry nestles underneath all three of the bridges to my left; my next destination before crossing the middle bridge. The wind is scathingly cold here. Boats bob about, waves lap hectically. I scoff my face and stretch my legs. My uncle messages me, “Where about are you?” I send a photo of the bridge back. Next up, South Queensferry.
Before I get into the meat of the town a woman walks out from her car in front of me and stops dead for seemingly no reason. I check my stride and go to pass her but she absent mindedly wanders to the side I’m going around. It is no big thing, but after marching for 11 miles now it was a strange feeling to me, stopped dead by a person not paying attention to anything. I leave her in my dust and enter a quiet town. Behind me the Forth Rail Bridge stands tall. Walking beneath it is nothing compared to taking a step back and viewing it. I always remember seeing it when I was younger on the TV and it seemed mystical to me. When I first moved up to Scotland it was the one thing I was desperate to see. Now, walking underneath it and having it as part of my adventure I felt a sense of connection to it. To bring myself back down to earth I finally found a toilet in South Queensferry and made sure I left my mark for any following Pilgrims. A miracle occurred there.
Soon enough I was dodging folk on pavements as I stormed up the hill towards the beginning of the bridge I was to cross. Once I got underneath it I felt a sting of excitement about what I was about to do. It’s cold, dark concrete consumed me as I looped up to the road from the town. Stopping briefly to adjust my backpack and jacket, I set out to go across. Then it hit me. A fear so deep, so bubbly and heavy that I almost fell to the floor. It wraithed inside of my stomach and my eyes became like a small tunnel. I staunchly marched forward as fast as I could, but once I’d reached the water the fear consumed me. Tiny gaps every 10 ft or so let me see the waters far below. Every coach that stormed past me bounced the large metalworks that struck up high and mighty above me. Wind blew and gust in a menacingly horrible way; it seemed determined to shove me over the edge. This was not enjoyable. I had hoped to grab some good photos of the Rail Bridge I adored so much whilst on here, but now… Get me off here! Metal creaked. The floor bounced. The wind blew. A cyclist went past and was nearly blown into me. Madman. At one point I swept past a porta-loo; what a way to go, blown into the Forth by a cubicle of shite. I could not get across to the otherside quick enough. But, had I known what I was about to tackle I may well have just stayed on the bridge.
It’s hot in the sun now. Face warm from the wind and no doubt the nerves I settled down on the steps that climb from the bridge to a road. Everything on this side of the Forth seems quiet and empty. No cars, nor people, mill about or make any sound. I take a moment. Now I convince myself that my Pilgrimage does indeed have trials, and the bridge was the biggest one by far. Never again! I proceed underneath its shadowy archways after a few more bites to eat. The road I’m on heads up and over a small hill before it dips suddenly down to swoop under the large motorway. In amongst the swirling, busy roads sits a boarded up house. It’s wee, messy and depressing. Concrete hugs the landscape and even in the yellow light of the day it is cold. This has become quite a tour of infrastructure, if that is the type of thing you’re into. I video call my wife.
Not as impressed by my feat of terror crossing the bridge as I thought she would be, she asks what my onward route is. Docks, Rosyth and forests, I reply. The sun is beating down now and I’m exposed to its warmth and the cold wind as I plod along. Down below me I see a grandfather and his granddaughter, fitted out with wellies, traversing a wind swept nature reserve. At least, these are the facts I project down upon the scene. Reeds and grass ebb and flow in the eager gusts. They shelter but chat enthusiastically. I stand for a while as they bounce away into the hazy grasses; tall bridges loom above them off into the choppy waters. I turn and continue along the most tedious road I’ve ever walked up.
Large metal buildings at the docks creak and boom as machinery, cranes, buildings get closer and more imposing. On the other side of the road there’s just shite. Sewerage works, quarries, a large car park where a bored looking guy in a JCB backhoe moves around asphalt. Usually I love a big of heavy machinery action, but I just want to get out of this tundrum place. It takes longer, it seems, than my whole walk completed beforehand to reach the pathway I need to dart up to get away. A pigeon coop castle stops me in my tracks, but the litter strewn path forces me to move on swiftly. My walks are all about moods and mindfulness; I find it difficult to reach those heady heights when bags of dog shit wave at me as I pass them as if I’m some kind of royal shitter.
The mood does not improve as I’m spat out into a disused industrial park. Large blue offices with smashed windows and fenced off to the nines greet me. Two lads saunter in front of me, neither see me until I whizz past them. “Eh!” One of them exclaims. Who knows what stories they have to hand to fling out at the drop of a hat. But I have wasted time watching families explore nature reserves and need to speed through my next section. I turn out of this and onto a roundabout. The housing estate across from me, and which I now need to navigate, is a familiar one to me. In my hometown you are looked down upon if you live on the wrong side of the river. And those that do look down upon those who live on the wrong side of the river, but also the wrong side of the railway. I won’t say which my current view stands in this chart of a made up class system. But, I look up to the right to a bus stop I need to pass and see a group of young lads, hand down their trousers and on their wee willy winkies and I decide to just head the opposite direction. If the Tesco employee was suspicious of my walking stick, or staff, wand? Then these chaps will want to make a few awkward inquiries; always trust your gut.
Pleasantly surprised by the streets and back alleys I wind down, I make my way quickly though Rosyth. I came across many cats but no people, until I reach the local football ground. It’s rugged and harshly laid out and windswept, much like everything else this side of the Forth it so far. A game is on and it has drawn quite a crowd. Shouts, punts of a football and conversation echo around the fields. I pass unnoticed as two posties discuss the ins and outs of the club. Before disappearing around a corner of wild bushes I witness the worst throw-in I’ve ever seen. But the managers shout enthusiasm, which is humbling and just all round nice, really. I spot a box of a school across the flat fields. More importantly I get my first view of Dunfermline. “I’m coming for you!” I point with my stick. Before long I’m turned onto a busy, loud road. Cars speed past kicking up dust, cups and I spot a perfectly new boot on the side of the road. How did it get here? Distantly I see a line of trees leading up a hill. My next stop to aim for; a cemetery.
What seemed like a mile or two later I cross in a rare gap of speedy cars and vans and onto a country lane. Straight as an arrow it heads to the cemetery where I pause briefly before heading into. I scan around; it is both old and new, both forgotten and intensely remembered. My road strikes right through it and around left, but the loop also goes right and back to where I’m standing. Lines and lines of graves fall into formation up the hill, around the loops and over through some trees. Some are old, almost green but many are shiny, bright, shaped intricately. There are plenty of flowers, more than I have ever seen in a cemetery. A freshly dug pile of dirt faces me directly straight on through the middle; orange in the glaring sun through the bare branches. I head right, along a long row of varying scales of gravestones to a bench. Thanking the folk on the plaque I sit and re-sock, eat and drink. I am alone only a few minutes before a blue car creeps into the cemetery, up the middle and begins to loop towards me. It stops. A woman of vibrant red lipstick and matching jacket steps out. She does not look around. Red roses are grasped firmly in her hands and she heads quickly to a grave. Roses planted, she says something. I look in my bag for some more food, I do not want to encroach upon such a moment. When I look up she is driving past me, eyes fixed ahead. She’s gone.
Part of me wanted to go see who she had just visited. Ultimately I decided against it and let the place drift in my mind. A beautifully colourful windmill danced in the middle of the rows. Around it some stones had faded flowers, some fresh, some well trodden, some slightly overgrown. I wonder, for the faded ones, what was the very last time they were visited. Why did the visits stop? Are they forgotten or are they remembered elsewhere? The cleaner ones make me weep; grief is all still too near for me. If I cry at an empty beach what hope do I have here? A van chugs into the entrance and stops, a bunch of guys jump out and begin to offload flowers; watering them in a very old tap that sits right near the gate. Another two cars enter to navigate the back end of the cemetery. I take it as a cue to leave, I have no purpose here.
Up upon the hill the cemetery swoops down from where I see the wartime graveyard, clean, green and precise in its purpose. Their white stone shines even in the shadows of the canopy above. My path turns muddy, leafy. Farms and fields replace roads and graves. This scenery is where I feel most at home. Dug out pathways, faded metal gates, long grasses and upturned troughs. Calmness descends over me and I stand for a while on a particularly exposed, high field and close my eyes to take in the sounds. Birds, wind, a distant gunshot. I move on.
Through a forest I pass silently in thought. A very recent fallen tree breaks my path in two; it has also stripped another tree of all its branches as it fell. Quite a sight to see, the sound must have been tremendous. Leaves crunch and slide as I navigate around it. I then bump into a runner with a bushy 80’s style moustache. He looks as surprised to see me rustling through the woods as I am of him. He hops one of the branches needlessly; it would have looked amazing in slow motion, I admit. Old walls of battered, mossy stones replace the leaves. They lead me to proper farmland, tractor markings and wide, open fields of various stages. Dodging puddles of depths unknown I march on towards a huddled collection of farmhouses and out buildings. A wee woman walking her dogs hurries past me; distrust in her eyes. A right angled turn left and I’m now facing North once more, and technically shouldn’t deviate from this direction until I meet my Uncle.
I am deep into mile 20 now. Dunfermline has been quite hidden down in the cemetery and winding farm pathways but now it taunts me openly. An adjustment of my backpack and a swig of water and I am set onto a thin line of a path on the edge of a busy road. It twists and turns before deciding to dive down into the town and before I know it I am encompassed by buildings and buses. It seemed like a click of a finger from farm to town, which is perhaps why this place is quite popular. My last trial is to find my way through the streets to where the gallery is; I immediately fail. Instead of heading right I take a wrong turn and find myself in a wee glen, complete with babbling brook. Another tree crosses my path, fallen fairly recently by the worn path being defined beneath it. I duck under and realise I now need to climb out of this quite beautiful place. How many trees have crossed my path today? 4? 5? I recount in my mind as I hustle up a zig zagging pathway. Onto solid ground and an uphill street leads me into the centre of town. I’m hot, sweaty and energy levels are in danger of plummeting right at the last. I head to Tesco and grab a Lucozade before my Uncle pops around the corner with a massive smile on his face.
Over a well earned pint we chat about all things worldly, both important and unimportant in life. Our food takes 5 working days to appear but I’m content. His artwork is awe inspiring, and a deep sense of pride grabs me as we view it and discuss it. There’s a deep, heavy therapy in the artwork that is echoed by the other pieces in the exhibit. Truly amazing to see. A few hours later I am dropped off at the station to head back on the next train that shows. As I whizz back along my 6 hour journey in 20 minutes I view my trials one by one, and a zen like sense of achievement washes over me. Immediately, though, I am distracted by a group of lads sat behind me; they are talking heavy Warhammer and a discussion has just broken out about one of them using the wrong paint for the wrong army. I waddle home from the station in Edinburgh, retracing my very early steps. My Pilgrimage is done and I am home once more. I never expected to find God, nor spiritual enlightenment, but I wish I had found more toilets and a steadier way to get across the Forth. In the morning I fly to Portugal, and have heard from reliable sources that Pilgrims do well there. But we shall see.

I'm on the journey I've waited for my entire life - and I want to remember it! Updates on my adjustment to British life, foreign travel, and all things abroad.

Mist rises. Saturday morning lacks the alarm clock. A full backpack sits in on a desk, waiting for me to pick it up and go. My second trip to Scotland’s capital. My first journey alone.
Sure, there are plenty of people to invite, but it’s mid-semester and students are swamped with projects. Not me — I only have two classes — so the desire to leave Stirling lures me to Edinburgh.
I rise at 7:32 despite no alarm. Twenty minutes. A comb strikes through my hair, gloss rubs across my lips, and I exit my bedroom with no regrets. The 7:52 bus doesn’t come until around 8:00; only four students sit at the stop. When I reach the train station, I catch a breath and keep going. I can’t back out now. I’m doing this for myself.
I buy a ticket for the 8:30 train and wait in the cold, open-aired platform. The squeaky wheels rush into the station and I enter with old women and old men. There’s an empty window seat, just for me. I listen to headphones and try not to drift back to sleep; only an hour until I arrive to my first destination.
Before I came to Scotland, when I watched videos of the best sites to visit in places like Edinburgh, I learned one of the cafes is marked as the location JK Rowling scratched the Harry Potter series on napkins. As soon as I step out of Edinburgh Waverley, I walk nine short minutes to The Elephant House, a near hole-in-the-wall restaurant with humble service (and filled with decorative elephants!). I order a cinnamon latte to get in the fall spirit, grab a seat at the front window, and open my laptop to Word. For the next hour, beside an Uber driver reading his morning paper, I write and edit and complete a chapter of my new novel, Floor Number Nine. It is the perfect rainy October morning. And While the street view is gorgeous, it makes me feel special when tourists stop in front of the window to take photographs of the cafe. For all they know, I’m a local!
When the waitress asks to take the empty plates, I understand I’ve overstayed my welcome, so I quickly save the final page of the chapter and stuff the laptop inside my backpack. Raincoat on, I flip the hood over my hair and search the next destination, the Writer’s Museum.
This free attraction is a short walk, tucked in a courtyard behind the skinny Lady Stair’s Close. It’s a quirky house with an open door and a sign which reads: Robert Louis Stevenson — Downstairs. Glad to get out of the rain, I step into the warm museum, greeted by photographs and displays. Stephenson’s original works, family portraits, and even household furniture (that I could touch!). After this exhibit, I return upstairs to a warm living room, complete with a fireplace, chandelier, wooden paneling, and old couples enjoying their morning tea. I learn this building was built in the 1620’s and belonged to Lady Stair.
Upstairs, exhibitions of poet Robert Burns and famous writer Sir Walter Scott decorate the traditional rooms. From chess boards, to cotton caps, to quill pens, I explore the artifacts of writers I’d read in grade school.
Returning to the rainy city, I walk a few blocks until I reach St. Giles Cathedral. This time, I don’t take pictures; I focus on the moment, soaking in the gorgeous stained glass, gazing at the vaulted ceilings, and listening to a pastor read Psalms to a quiet audience.
The National Museum of Scotland is not far from this cathedral. While this modern building seems bland on the exterior, its structure is fascinating. Totaling 6 floors, this museum is a maze of ancient and modern exhibits. I spend an hour and a half starting upstairs and working my way down. The map lists highlighted attractions, so I go in search for these — the canteen of Bonnie Prince Charlie, the clay creations of Picasso, ornate jewelry crafted by women centuries ago. What I find most intriguing is Dolly the cloned sheep. When I spot the thick glass case, I step as close as possible to the famous animal, surprised to learn the embryo was cloned in a Scottish laboratory. It is surreal, staring into the real eyes of the sheep I briefly studied in ninth grade biology.
I check the time on my phone and decide to move on to the next location. I’ve made plans to visit Dean Village, a quaint section outside of the inner city. Google Maps says it is a twenty-five minute walk, and I head down the street with an eager spirit. The rain is gone, fog rolls above the Edinburgh Castle, and I’m immersed in the perfect autumnal aesthetic.
I see a pub with a recognizable heading: Greyfriar’s Bobby. The church behind it is surrounded by a famous kirkyard (graveyard) where a dog, Greyfriar’s Bobby, is buried. While I don’t understand the significance of the dog or his master, I pass the pub and enter the church, expecting to find another intricate cathedral. While the interior is less impressive (I accidentally get lost, enter a set of closed doors, and find myself in the office rooms in the second level of the church), a guide leads me to the dog’s grave. Covered with a half-empty bush, the stone is planted directly in front of the church, marking the loyal dog who lived for sixteen years.
Large tour groups stroll through the foggy graveyard; I make my own rounds, using the time to take photographs of the fog-covered steeples and creepy tombstones. The perfect October location.
When you pass the statue of the beloved dog, right beside the Greyfriar’s pub, you are supposed to rub its nose for good luck. Not knowing this, I (uneducated American that I am) simply stroke the bronze fur and continue down the path on Google Maps. I have to see Dean Village, after all!
But another cathedral catches my eye. And after stopping inside, I recognize the brand names of giant stores across the road — I’ve made it to the shopping district. Princes Street, specifically. Across from me lies a Starbucks, an Urban Outfitters, a Primark, and a TopShop. I know where I’m headed after the village.
As directed by Google Maps, I hike down a hill under a bridge. It is darker now, and quieter, but I’m confident the destination will be worth the trek. The closer I get, however, (a sign on a building reads: Dean Village — This Way), the emptier and emptier the streets become. Eventually, as I step into the picaresque location, I walk alone. The cobblestone streets are wet. I slip clumsily down the hill onto my back, and no one is there to help me up.
This is okay. Laughing, I continue to walk down the street and cross a bridge. At first, the lack of shops and people makes the village underwhelming, but then I take gorgeous photos of the landscape, and I am fully content.
Tired and ready for rest, I return to Princes Street and enter the Starbucks. Here, I charge my phone, find some free WiFi, and eat a snack to prepare for the rest of the afternoon.
On the way to the Sir Walter Scott monument, I am captivated by a baroque-looking steeple. The cathedral, St. Mary’s Cathedral, is enormous, and I’m shocked I’ve never heard of the church until now. I walk down a broad street, full of wide marble buildings and Scottish flags, until I reach the front door and stroll inside. Again, my breath is taken:
Of course, photographs never capture the true atmosphere of cathedrals!
The Sir Walter Scott Monument is the largest and tallest monument to a writer in the world. As a creative writing major, this should impress me — and it does, however, this is the only site which requires a fee to enter. So I don’t. I do walk around the garden, stare up at the statue of Scott himself, and take plenty of photographs with the structure.
For the rest of the evening, I pass the time until my 5:30 train with shopping. Urban Outfitters has a 70% off sale. The Primark consists of three whole stories. I dip into Top Shop (because I’ve never been to a physical store before) as well as H&M, and before I know it, I’m racing through a line to purchase souvenirs before rushing to catch the train.
My first trip alone in the nation’s capitol. Needless to say, I am proud of myself and all the locations I am able to visit. Days like these help solidify my decision to study abroad; I need them, because if I’m honest, sometimes I feel like I made a mistake in thinking I could last four months here. Foreign travel, especially without any friends or relatives to travel with, is frightening. But it is also thrilling, and it calls me. Days like this prove I am up for the challenge.

Part Two of our Three Part coverage of the 2023 Edinburgh Festival Fringe.Find Part One here.Find Part Three here.
In 1947, a post-WW2 Europe came together to celebrate the arts at the newly formed Edinburgh International Festival. Eight theatre companies who had not been invited decided to show up anyway, and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe was created — the first-ever “Fringe Festival.” Since then, cities around the world have formed their own versions of the Fringe, but the original remains the largest. In fact, it holds the record as the largest performing arts festival in the world.
For its 2023 edition, 3,553 shows graced 288 venues all across the city — transforming the medieval streets of the Scottish capital into a bustling hub of creativity. With so many productions during the festival’s three-and-a-half-week run, crafting an itinerary proved to be a daunting task. But with the help of a few Excel spreadsheets, a good pair of walking shoes, and a very full calendar, I was able to see 57 shows during my seven days in Edinburgh — a mere 1.6% of the overall lineup, but a solid dive into the Fringe’s immersive offerings.
Here are my fifteen favorite immersive shows from the 2023 Edinburgh Festival Fringe (including a few in the Edinburgh International Festival):
Big Kid Kindergarten — Play Immersive (USA)
As adults, we don’t often get the time, space, or permission to play. Interests become hobbies become side hustles, and unstructured play is set aside in favor of adulting. Big Kid Kindergarten invites us to reconnect with our childhood selves.
At the beginning of the experience, Soleil Kohl, our teacher for the next hour, asks us to close our eyes and connect with our inner five-year-old. A variety of familiar items are strewn across the room — legos, Play-Doh, coloring books, crafting materials, and plushies. We choose the songs that play in the background — nursery rhymes, Barney, Sharon Lois & Bram — the soundtrack of our childhoods. As our class time comes to an end, we tidy up the space and then cuddle up with a pillow for a quick nap time.
It’s a simple concept and straightforward execution, but a surprisingly emotional experience for some (myself included) largely due to the insight, guidance, and warmth with which Kohl facilitates.
Bodies — Ray Young (UK)
After a twenty-minute Scotrail ride away from the bustle of the festival city, I find myself floating in the pool at Deans Community High School. Colored lights, a sprinkler, and miscellaneous inflatables scatter across the surface of the water. We’ve all been given the identity of a specific international body of water and told that this pool is the gathering place where we’re all to connect. Twinkling projections fill the space and soothing music fills the air.
There’s an oft-used analogy of immersive theatre being likened to immersion in water. As such, the venue and conceit of Bodies seem quite fitting. Though the show offers little in terms of narrative, the space became a place for meditation, and a welcome moment of calm amongst the busyness of the Festival.
Brave Space — Aloft (USA)
We stand gathered around a sheet. When given the signal, our hands grasp its edges and we lift it above our heads, walk underneath, and then lower it beneath our feet. We’ve built a big top, but this one is more intimate than most — the quarters are cramped such that the delineation between stage and audience is blurred. Hoops spin unnervingly close by, acrobats swing from a trapeze directly above my head, and props are handed to us for safekeeping. At one point, I hold onto a piece of rope alongside four other audience members while the performers, kept aloft by the rope and their trust in a handful of strangers, twirl in the air.
‘Audience participation’ and ‘acrobatics’ are two phrases that don’t often appear together. The latter requires peak physical conditioning, hours of practice, and great technical ability… the former an unpredictable entity. By combining these two, Aloft has created a genuine immersive circus experience and necessitated the creation of a brave, trusting, space on both sides to make it work.
Club Life — Fred Deakin (UK)
In Club Life, Fred Deakin tours us through the Edinburgh underground club scene of the 80s and 90s that he helped shape. But this exercise goes beyond a typical bout of reminiscing — instead of simply telling us about the parties he lovingly crafted and DJ’d, Deakin invites us onto the dancefloor to experience them ourselves.
With a few DJ decks, vinyl records, and a cast of dancers, key moments in Deakin’s musical life are recreated onstage. From the genre agnosticism of Thunderball to the delightfully quirky Misery (“the worst club night that there ever was or ever could be,”) we dance our way through seven distinct parties from his past.
Part dance party, part autobiography, Club Life is an engaging and heartwarming deep dive into a creative soul.
Ctrl Room :_ — Black Hound Productions (UK)
In the not-so-distant future, technology has changed the face of the battlefield. Armed with lethal AI innovations, tech giant Polemas has become a global military powerhouse. As I enter the Edinburgh Army Reserve Centre, I’m greeted by a uniformed individual. Are they part of the show or an army member using the space? This blurring of show vs. reality was present throughout the experience and contributed to Ctrl Room :_ being the most immersive production I attended during the festival.
After choosing to align myself with the civilian resistance, I’m brought to their control room. Over the next 60 minutes, we identify an aerial strike drone, build explosive weapons, devise a military strategy, and attempt to decode a mysterious device. Meanwhile, our opponents at Polemas work through their own set of challenges, and every action, puzzle solved, and decision made by both sides influences the final outcome.
Throughout, our rebel leaders emphasize the urgency of the task at hand — some of the best acting I’ve ever seen in an escape room environment. The overall experience felt so realistic that at one point I found myself cowering under a table in genuine fear. As we exited the room for the finale, bulletproof vests on our chests and Molotov cocktails in hand, I mentally steeled myself for the battlefield… then breathed a sigh of relief when we were instead led to a cutscene in the initial briefing room.
Food — Geoff Sobelle (USA) [International Festival]
Food is a playful and thoughtful exploration of society’s relationship with food — from the grandiosity of the fine dining industry to the humble origins, and increasingly complicated reality of the agricultural systems that feed us.
While sitting around a large fine dining table, Sobelle hands me a wine menu with a very specific set of instructions: I should not drink the glass of wine he’s about to pour for me. Instead, I’m asked to smell the liquid and connect the scent to a year and memory. The odor of whiteboard marker fills my nose and I share an early high school memory. A mix of magic, cleverness, and absurdity brings this half of the show to life. An order of salmon rolls is conjured from thin air, an impromptu trip to the “Arctic” produces the freshest of arctic char, and our enigmatic waiter decides to scarf down all the leftovers. The magic elements may not be the most elegant I’ve seen — Sobelle’s sleight of hand is at times visible, but this is easily forgiven as the true magic lies in the delightful absurdity of the situation.
As the restaurant “closes” for the night, Sobelle pulls the tablecloth off — dishes and all — to reveal a large surface of dirt underneath. He crawls into the space, unaffected by the damage being done to his dress shirt and slacks. From here, a once chatty Sobelle guides us in a silent demonstration of the industrialization of farming, as well as the infrastructure and communities that we built around it.
They say it’s bad manners to play with your food, but for Geoff Sobelle I think we can make an exception. With charm and a healthy dose of playfulness, Food is a thoughtful and whimsical meditation on an important industry.
Funeral — Ontroerend Goed (Belgium)
“If you want to remember, remember.If you want to forget, forget.But sometimes, when you want to remember you forget.But sometimes, when you want to forget your remember”
So go the translated lyrics of the Latin song we’re taught at the beginning of Funeral. The show, by immersive stalwarts Ontroerend Goed, is a collective ritual celebrating finiteness and the knowledge that we are not alone in whatever endings we mourn.
From start to end, Funeral emphasizes the importance of community. In one of the most unique openings I’ve experienced, we’re directed to shake hands with each and every audience member as we enter the room. Later, we pass logs down from person to person until each individual has a post to sit on. At the start of the show, we are offered the chance to share the names of those we are mourning. As these names are read out loud, I feel my eyes prickle with tears, and look around the room to see my emotions mirrored in the faces of others.
The most notable display of community-building that Funeral initiated was inviting people to the venue’s basement for a cup of post-show tea. This created a space where audience members could unpack the experience together. While many shows at this year’s Fringe emphasized the importance of community and connection, Funeral’s poignant joint rituals and creation of space for discussion made it the most successful at exploring these themes.
Hayfever — Emerge Production House (UK)
Hayfever has the honor of being the “fringiest” show I had the pleasure of seeing at the festival.
As I walk into the room, a hot pink gorilla hands me two pieces of cardstock, one red and one green. We’re told that we’re actually in outer space and part of the studio audience for a TV show. At certain times, we can vote for an outcome using our colored cards, and at any point in the show, we can pause the action to request a monologue, a musical theatre number, an interpretive dance, or an on-the-spot “auction” of any item on stage. All the while, a drama about love, murder, xenophobia, and feminism unfolds.
It sounds chaotic, and once us audience members get the hang of things, it absolutely is. Heartfelt speeches are interrupted by songs about ham; during an auction, I deprive the male lead of his glasses; a monologue reveals the nefarious purpose this television program serves and the classist structures that keep it running. There’s too much going on, and the ambitiousness of the conceit often leaves me confused, but it’s just so much fun.
Klanghaus: Darkroom — KlangHaus (UK)
“Try and keep your eyes open.” But as I sit alone in the church basement, the lights starting to dim, the urge to shut my eyes is persistent. Eyes-open darkness is a very different sensation from eyes-closed darkness. Music fills the air, and I feel my body begin to relax. As the sound of waves crashing fills the room, the percussive reverberation of drums fills my chest. I didn’t notice at first, but live instruments are being played all around me. I’ve become so accustomed to pre-recorded sound within immersive audio experiences, so this realization catches me off guard and leaves me with a giant grin.
As the music calms to silence, the lights switch on and I’m escorted onto a couch. There, I unpack the experience with the two musicians who moved from instrument to instrument — counting their steps in the dark — to perform for me.
Whereas Klanghaus’ other Fringe show, Klanghaus: Inhaus, is a communal audio-visual experience, Darkroom is its antithesis — a solo experience in the dark. Both allowed me to engage in the music on a deeper level, but in the eyes wide open darkness of Klanghaus: Darkroom, I felt an intense, personal connection with the music.
Lucy and Friends — Soho Theatre, John Mackay and United Agents (UK)
After being recommended the show by a friend, I purchased a ticket to Lucy and Friends — an effort to diversify my Fringe showgoing. Halfway through the opening number, while covered in confetti and being crawled on by a tree cosplayer, I realized this show would probably count as immersive.
Lucy and Friends is a one-woman show where the role of “Lucy” is performed by the absurdly hilarious Lucy McCormick, and the role of “Friends” is played by the entire audience. Song sheets are distributed as we enter the venue, glasses of wine are shared with the audience, and we’re even tasked with cleaning up the theater. At the end of the show, a cell phone is passed around and audience members enter their contact info to start a group text chat.
Hilarious and unexpected, Lucy and Friends consistently caught me off guard while I absolutely laughed my head off.
Sensuous Governing — Sisters Hope (Denmark)
A line forms outside the Danish Consulate building, where a veiled figure in a white blouse and floor-length skirt stands barefoot. One by one, she beckons us forward and instructs us to remain silent as we fill out a cryptic questionnaire about the current state of our body, mind, and society as a whole.
Thus, began one of the most curious and thought-provoking experiences I had throughout my time at the Fringe. Over the next hour and a half I dance with a stranger, engage in a tender staring contest, and walk blindfolded up a spiral staircase. Throughout, the ethereal “Sisters” serve as my guide, their every motion a delicate dance whose tenderness I can sense even with my eyes bound.
It’s difficult to describe what makes Sensuous Governing so beautiful. It’s a strange experience, and will definitely leave some participants skeptical, but I also found it incredibly moving. As I exited the building, I locked eyes with another audience member. We tried to discuss what we had both just experienced but were at a loss for words — perhaps in part a side effect of having remained silent for so long. Finally, we both agreed, “That was really special.”
The Lost Lending Library — Punchdrunk Enrichment (UK) [International Festival]
At 314 floors high and with 78 spiral-side departments, this library is the largest collection of books and stories in the entire world. But, as the title suggests, it’s currently lost and we’ll need some expert-level storytellers to find it.
The Lost Lending Library by Punchdrunk Enrichment (Punchdrunk’s educational and outreach arm) is an enchanting immersive experience designed for children. The show is a fine example of entertainment talking to children rather than talking down to them, and in doing so creates a memorable experience for both kids and their accompanying adults. Throughout the performance, the actors engage directly with the young audience members, who field every query and conversation with an ease and creativity far superior to what you’d ever find in an adult audience.
Once we do find the library, even the most skeptical of adults is in awe. The set is absolutely gorgeous, filled with intricate details and surprises to be uncovered. It’s a real treat to see Punchdrunk’s immersive magic go to work at teaching the importance of storytelling. As we leave the library, we’re each handed a special “library card,” and from the squeals of excitement this garners, you can tell that Punchdrunk’s teachings have made a genuine impact.
The Most Toast — RGB Monster (UK)
The premise is simple: “Somebody in the audience will have eaten the most toast. We will find them.”
Armed with a large piece of chart paper, a permanent marker, and a wonderfully dry sense of wit, hosts Katharyn Henson and Ollie Horn interrogate the audience as to the quantity of their toast consumption. Approximations are not permitted. Uncertainty is dismissed. This is a serious scientific inquiry, and they accept nothing but precise measurements.
Charts are charted. Calculators are utilized. Integrity is called into question. Then, a winner is chosen and brought onstage for a celebration fitting of a toast-eating champion. The Most Toast is what happens when a brilliantly simple hook, a quick-witted pair of hosts, and an enthusiastic audience come together. It’s everything it’s advertised to be, but with a level of commitment that elevates its silliness into hilarity.
Two Strangers Walk Into A Bar — Tilda Cobham-Hervey (Australia)
I sit down at a bar. Someone hands me a suspiciously heavy tote bag and a headset, then tells me everything I’ll need is contained within. And that’s how my meet-cute begins… but maybe reality has different plans.
Through a series of audio prompts, worksheets, and semi-scripted dialogue, Two Strangers Walk Into A Bar creates the circumstances for a real-life rom-com to unfold. Except, instead of falling in love with a stranger, all that quirkiness and convenient serendipity sets you up to fall in love with that beautiful, messy, unpredictable thing called real life.
Humanity-affirming, grin-inducing, and absolutely charming, Two Strangers Walk Into A Bar is one of the most memorable immersive experiences I’ve ever had.
Without Sin — Without Sin (Ireland)
Two strangers enter a confessional booth and through a series of guided questions leave with a knowledge of the other far greater than what a typical 20-minute conversation would create.
As I step inside the dimly lit booth, I slip the provided headphones over my ears. Soothing music fills the space, and a voice instructs me to open the slot on my right where a deck of cards is placed. One by one, my companion and I take turns drawing from the pile and asking each other the questions written on them. “Have you ever taken something that wasn’t yours?” “What’s something you used to believe that you don’t anymore?” “Who are you most worried about disappointing?” We volley back and forth, sometimes offering elaborate responses, other times opting for more cryptic answers. Unable to see the face of our partner, all we can do is focus on the inflections in their voice.
The end of the experience arrives all too soon, and we are prompted to write a note to our partner. I reflect on the morsels of truth and vulnerability she shared and pen a heartfelt wish for a stranger I barely know, yet find myself rooting for. As we exit the booth, we embrace, squeezing each other tight through slightly teary eyes. Human connection is a beautiful thing, and Without Sin fosters it in a simple, but beautiful way.

At the castle no one was royal. They dragged along their common provenances, hometowns banging around on the cobblestones behind them like oxygen tanks keeping them all alive. In front of me an American woman blathered on about history to the cashier, a Scottish man who looked like he had fought in both World Wars and developed all of his wrinkles by falling asleep face first on presidential biographies.
“We don’t have castles in America, because that’s when the Native Americans were there,” she said, word for word, in a baby voice.
She suggested that he really should make time to visit the northern seaside, and named a town there that she had liked in the way an aristocrat might say Cartier to the homeless. He gave her a scathing look, as though pounding waves of his battle-spilled ancestral blood had carved the very contours of the Scottish coastline, and handed her a ticket.
It was my turn. He asked me where I was from.
“Canada,” I lied, so as not to be associated by a commonality as thin as nationality with the woman who preceded me.
The tickets were £19.50, about $30 USD. At least it’s free to visit the White House. In the end we always have things going for us.
Beyond the ticket gate the grey stones of Edinburgh Castle were rain-soaked to black. The other tourists and I became zombies at the behest of our individualized audio tours, wandering around the grounds glassy-eyed, bits of history lost on our daydreaming, foreign minds. A group of unruly schoolchildren sat on the ground eating oranges. Citrus disagreeably robbed the air of its earthiness, its wet stones, dirt and gunpowder. When it was time for a lesson the children fled, leaving their modern trash behind, fruit juice bottles, orange peels and plastic Lidl shopping bags crinkling in the wind. The base of the only remaining segment of the twelfth century castle looked like a littered patch of Interstate 405.
I found the American woman from the ticket line, now with her husband, at an overlook on the far side of the castle. The sheer rock faces of the Salisbury Crags angled skyward like a drawn knife over the grasses of Holyrood Park. Gothic spires formed the black peaks of Edinburgh’s jagged old skyline.
“They have castles poppin’ up outta nowhere!” cried the husband. He wore a knit Denver Broncos ski hat, shifted his weight in basketball shoes, and jingled the coins in his pocket. He gave the impression that he was agitated about missing a football game. At the time it was 3:00am in Denver, and a Tuesday at that.
“Fhak. That’s fhaking beautiful. I could live heah. I could live heah no problem,” said another man taking in the view. He had a big pink face wet with sweat. He pulled off a fleece sweatshirt and revealed a Red Sox t-shirt with Yastrzemski printed on the back. His friend was in a MIT Campus police sweatshirt. They wore their hometown like house keys on cords around the necks of little boys. Everything about them said that they belonged to somewhere else. They would never fall through the cracks of this or that ancient city. They would always be pointed home.
All of the tourists gathered around a fancily dressed solider giving an inaudible speech in front of a cannon. They held up digital cameras, iPads and phones and littered the space with the garbage of beep-beeps and misappropriated flashes illuminating nothing.
He fired the cannon. An explosion burst forth and its burned debris floated softly in the wind, like gentle little murderers. We all gasped and screamed. The sexy girl next to me jumped a mile and swore in some foreign language. She had an underfed waist and overinflated breasts. She wore tight, cheaply embroidered jeans and wobbled on the cobblestones in leopard print high heels. She looked around uneasily, like an alligator in a pit of marshmallows, looking for purchase for her assets, and found none.
We dragged each other back to the places that possessed us. The black castle left no mark. Its glitter and prestige did not dull our nationalities. It did not obliterate the ways our countries teach us to behave.
We don’t have castles in America.
To us castles are cartoons, the candy-colored settings of fairytales. I wanted an abandoned glass slipper on the steps. I wanted three drops of blood in the freshly fallen snow. I would never have expected that kind of magic out of the White House. I was trapped in the Disney tower of my American girlhood, just as obviously from my own country as everyone else.
On my way out, the field-tripping children were running around the tiny rooms of the oldest, darkest part of the castle. The cried out ghost sounds and giggled in delight at the creepy echoes of their own voices, bouncing off the walls of dirt and stone, returning right back to them.
Thanks so much for reading.
I would be thrilled if you clicked “Recommend” below. You can also sign up for my newsletter. I’ll email next time I take a trip and have something for you to read.
For now I have other posts on Belfast, Vegas, Santorini, Isle of Skye and Boston.

Edinburgh is a haunted city.
I don’t mean ‘haunted’ in the supernatural sense, although I could point with my eyes closed and manage to hit several Ghost Tour aficionados who would be only too happy to prove me wrong. No, I mean ‘haunted’ in the sense that the city is a duology — ancient meets modern, and the ghosts of old Dùn èideann certainly haven’t gone to rest.
I have a friend from elsewhere who described Edinburgh as ‘having a quality’, and it does. The city is at home in all of its guises: tourist trap, hyperactive university town, well-to-do business capital. It is at once surprising and satisfying to see a place that wears all sorts of coats throughout the year, and it looks fabulous doing so. She may be many things, but the one thing she never is — under-dressed.
She also bleeds history. Walk across North Bridge, and you’ll find yourself in the heart of Edinburgh’s Old Town. And by ‘old’, we mean OLD. Your feet will find the gaps between cobbled streets that haven’t been updated since they were first laid, and if you look up at any building, you’ll see the ghosts of Edinburgh’s past, beautifully rendered in the form of intricate cornices, gargoyles and ornate carvings. Find yourself a close (Scottish word for tiny little street) and you’ll realise how little has actually been changed. These narrow streets are thrilling reminders of a long ago world that somehow still exists here, quietly maintaining a link to Scottish history.
It’s easy, standing in the shadow of Castle Rock on a winter’s day, to hear the bustle that would have been. Edinburgh captures our past, and feeds it to us in tiny mouthfuls. You don’t HAVE to look, but if you do, you’ll see stories in the walls. You’ll see markings and numbers left over from the original craftsmen. You’ll see heavy brass doorbells that no longer sing, but sit now as silent sentinels. In some houses and flats, original features languish beside modern conveniences: a Belfast sink next to a toaster, elegant sash windows behind a widescreen tv or immensely high ceilings looking down at a state of the art computer. It’s a quiet kind of ghost, but an effective haunting nonetheless.
It helps that we love our history, and we do everything we can to preserve it. Hardly any older buildings in Edinburgh get demolished and built up again. We’re used to re-purposing what is old, because although it is old, it is not broken. It’s a part of us, of our bones. They may creak, but they still function. As a result, new shop names are placed under carvings and signs that still bear the moniker of a store from decades ago. These things, they tell us where we’ve come from, and it seems important to the deep consciousness of Scotland to know this, to feel it. It’s the reason we sing ‘Auld Lang Syne’ at Hogmanay, and still compete in Highland Games. It would be a travesty to lose this unconscious memory of who we once were, to be out of touch with the stories of our national identity.
There is grandeur, too, in the ghost of our city. St Giles cathedral is a towering exercise in gothic beauty, sitting as it does, amongst tourist shops and chain restaurants. George Heriots School is a literal castle, complete with turrets, grand chamber rooms and teachers who flit about, crow-like, in antiquated robes. It inspired Hogwarts, after all, and it’s easy to see why. The city’s ghosts have magic. It is a type of grandeur that we so often overlook in our modern lives. Most of us spend our days in front of screens, from the ever increasingly large screens of our smartphones, to the computers that fill our thousands of offices. If we tried, we probably could spend an entire day never looking up or away from the eye-straining technology we rely on. This is not necessarily an evil — technology has allowed us to progress faster in the last 100 years than in the preceding 1000, but it does mean that we are in increasing danger of losing something precious — our historic identity.
So if you find yourself walking the cobbled streets of Edinburgh, take a moment to look. Look past the throngs of people hurrying against the sideways Scottish wind. Look past the brightly coloured lights of Christmas, or the sheer spectacle that is the Edinburgh Fringe. Instead, look for things that breathe quietly but do not speak. Look for the things that tell little stories of the past. Don’t worry, Edinburgh’s ghosts are friendly, and like all good Scots, incredibly welcoming hosts.

Background: In 2022, the Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (TAS) programme funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) brought together experts in key disciplines across the UK to investigate the responsibility dimension of AI-driven autonomous systems, especially in areas where we might realistically expect that AI systems will be used to complement or substitute for human decision making.
On the 10th of July 2023, the four Responsibility project teams met in Edinburgh, Scotland to share the preliminary findings of our research, and to identify any common ground across our very different approaches to the challenge, which range across computer science, robotics, philosophy, law and the social sciences. Our declaration here, which will soon be followed by an expanded version including concrete examples of application to AI and autonomous systems, reflects that common ground.
We hope it will start a wider conversation about what matters most when we talk about “Responsible AI’ and responsibility for autonomous systems.*
*This declaration is a collaboration among researchers in the UKRI Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (TAS) programme who work on Responsibility in the context of design, development, procurement, use, governance and regulation of AI and autonomous systems. It does not necessarily represent the views of the wider TAS programme, its partners or universities.
Preface: Our work has crystallised a shared belief in the possibility of responsible development and governance of AI and autonomous systems (AI/AS). However novel the challenges these technologies present, they are not beyond the reach of responsibility, as a set of mature social and technical practices that underpin trustworthiness. We have been here before, with other inherently risky technologies that seemed ungovernable. And yet, those technologies that became part of the trusted infrastructure of many societies — biomedical technologies, aviation, automobiles, steam power — are now largely governed in ways that enable innovation and its benefits without pushing all of the risk and cost onto unprotected publics.
We must advance AI/AS innovation toward its own stage of trusted maturity: by creating, promoting, and embedding robust and committed responsibility practices in the development and use of AI/AS. Our joint declaration proposes four shifts in the framing of responsibility that we believe are needed for the responsible development, procurement, use and governance of AI and autonomous systems, in the UK and beyond.
First, it may help to briefly clarify some of the different meanings that ‘responsibility’ can have in this context:
Four Key Shifts on Responsibility Needed to Achieve Responsible AI
1. Accepting responsibility over describing and ascribing responsibility
2. Seeing responsibility as relational over seeing responsibility as an agent property
3. Prioritising responsibility as attending to vulnerability over responsibility as blame
4. Focusing on sustainability of responsible AI/AS innovation over pace of innovation
ANALYSIS:
Our research projects draw from technical, social, and humanistic disciplines to study distinct forms of responsibility (moral, legal, causal, role or virtue) as they apply in practice to responsible AI and autonomous systems (AI/AS) development, deployment and governance. Much of our work describes how, when, and which of these notions of responsibility should be attributed to the different types of agents (human and machine) that make up sociotechnical systems like AI/AS.
A deep understanding of these dimensions is essential for the future of responsible AI/AS. Appeals to responsibility are only effective when we can be clear and specific about what it means in any given context. But we hold that however rigorous our research on responsibility, its future impact depends upon the collective will of the actors who shape and govern our tech ecosystem to act on it.
Responsibility can be analysed in minute detail, but if responsibility is never accepted, never taken by the actors with the power to do so, these studies will be impotent, their power to guide action wasted. Our research must, to have its intended impact, be paired with bold and ongoing commercial and public commitments to accept responsibility for the power and consequences of autonomous systems.
2. Seeing responsibility as relational over responsibility as an agent property
The single thread that binds our projects is the power of responsibility to enable and sustain trustworthy relationships between people, organisations, institutions and publics. How AI/AS impact these relationships is why responsibility matters in this context.
Yet responsibility is too often viewed solely as an isolated property of an agent or system. We seek to find the ‘responsible’ component that caused a harm or accident, or the ‘responsible’ human that is morally accountable or legally liable for it, without considering the relationships that such attributions of responsibility help to hold together.
Even when we seek to understand what makes an agent in some way responsible for an action or decision, it’s the human relationships affected by that action or decision that make this question so important for us to answer. These relationships, and the responsibilities they entail, vary and shift over time and in different contexts. For this reason, mere promises to ‘act responsibly’ or ‘design responsibly’ are less helpful than articulating the ongoing, evolving duties of care that publics rightly expect and that people, organisations and institutions must fulfil to protect the specific relationships in which they and AI/AS are embedded. We hold that the relationships that responsibility serves must move to the centre of ‘responsible AI/AS’ research and its uses.
3. Prioritising responsibility as attending to vulnerability over responsibility as blame
Most studies of responsibility in AI/AS focus on mechanisms for responsibility attribution and the distribution of blame, liability or other obligations to responsible parties. While this work is essential, it is often silent about the vital political function of responsibility: to establish conditions of legitimacy for the human exercise of power, by requiring those who use or unleash a power to demonstrate due care for the interests of those it makes vulnerable.
While we must do more to identify and hold accountable those who use AI/AS in irresponsible and harmful ways, responsible AI/AS is not merely about finding and sanctioning ‘bad actors.’ All who exercise and unleash the material and economic power of AI/AS, even with the best of intentions, must start attending — and be required to attend — responsibly to the vulnerabilities that AI/AS create, perpetuate, amplify or relieve.
Foregrounding the needs of the most vulnerable, led by their knowledge of the lived impact of new technologies, also generally results in better protections for all; it is the most reliable way to ensure that AI/AS are safe and beneficial for everyone. Otherwise, by unjustly endangering human lives and publics, those who build and deploy these tools surrender the social license for these technologies as legitimate powers.
4. Focusing on sustainability of responsible AI/AS innovation over pace of innovation
Much of the debate around AI and autonomous systems focuses on the ideal pace of responsible innovation — calls to speed it up (for those whose primary aim is economic growth and rapid realization of technology’s potential benefits) and calls to slow it down (for those whose primary aim is the safety, security and competent control of AI/AS).
While this debate exposes important concerns, we think both impulses result from a misplaced focus on the overall pace at which AI/AS innovation happens, rather than what is needed to make AI/AS innovation sustainable, in the UK and globally.
Some applications of AI/AS, for example in the health and climate tech areas, warrant accelerated research and development, in responsible ways. Others, such as the automation of moral and political human judgments with irreversible and severe consequences, arguably require delay or indefinite pause. Yet we call for centering the overarching question: how to make a responsible AI/AS innovation ecosystem sustainable.
Sluggish AI/AS innovation that stalls from lack of investment and public confidence will not serve the UK or the world well. Yet neither will rapid, unchecked innovation that lasts only a few years or decades before running out of public goodwill and available resources.
AI/AS are already placing great demands on our limited global resources (water, energy, rare earth minerals), new stresses on social and economic resilience, and growing challenges for security, human rights and social cohesion. These costs and stressors must be managed responsibly and holistically, with an eye to AI/AS innovation that can take us all much farther, not simply faster.
We invite those from across the ‘Responsible AI’ community and beyond to comment and help us develop and refine these provocations; in the coming weeks we will share an expanded version with concrete examples of applications of these four shifts in Responsible AI research and innovation.

What I loved about Edinburgh was being able to walk to work through a beautiful place.
– Roger Allam
Sangam and I visited Edinburgh with our friends in December 2023. We visited this charming city for a day trip.
It was a long drive from Newcastle upon Tyne to Edinburgh for us. As we drove towards Edinburgh, we doubted if it was a good decision to drive in this weather. The weather was worse with heavy rains and harsh wind. Driving became extremely difficult and tedious for us. However, we managed to reach Edinburgh around 2 p.m.
It was still cloudy, but we were glad that it was at least not raining. We wasted no time and decided to search for a restaurant for lunch. The experience of walking around the city was incredibly beautiful and surreal. The place was as charming and exquisite as I had read in the books.

A new act asked me for advice on how to write their debut Edinburgh fringe show… I don’t think anyone knows how it’s supposed to be done, but I jotted down some notes, then turned it into this post in the hope it might help others.
I’m Ollie Horn, and you can see me live! Click here for my tour dates.
The reason you’re doing Edinburgh is you’ll get to do this show 25 times in a row. You can’t possibly leave with the same show you came with. So, all you really should be worried about is your first show of the run, which will be a preview anyway. So don’t feel too much pressure to arrive with something perfect; you’ll get there.
Spend less time worrying and more time writing and performing. Doing your first hour isn’t a big a deal as you think it is, and just as you’ve got a essentially no chance of taking this show to the festival and achieving life-changing fortune and industry adoration; you’re also probably unable to make any career-altering mistakes either.
But stop having self doubt.
First, even though it’s an open access festival, Edinburgh has just enough gatekeepers that with only very few exceptions, you’re unlikely to have been given a room at the festival if at least somebody who has some professional and reputational skin in the game didn’t think you’d be able to do it. There’s no inside and outside in comedy. Or, at least to the extent to which there is: you’re in!
Second, there is a reason why lots of people who have done perfectly well received hours at the festivals are unable to get themselves booked to do club 20s at the weekend stand-up clubs. It’s possible to entertain people for an hour in the context of a festival show without too much of a skillset. If you’re reading this thinking, “but I do have a skillset — I’m good at comedy!” then stop thinking that you can’t do an hour. You absolutely can.
Obviously do whatever you want, but I think there are two approaches, and having tried both, I don’t think it matters which you choose.
The first is to settle on a story, theme, or message first. For my first hour ‘Pig in Japan’, I wanted to tell the story of becoming a minor TV personality in Japan, and the bad experience I had on set that made me decide to quit. I already had the videos I wanted to play, and I vaguely knew how I wanted the audience to feel.
Once I had the north star, I then went about adding routines to see if any of them helped me with the narrative I wanted to write. Each preview I did I hot-swapped routines that I’d either done before, or had written especially, to see if I could hit a certain point or beat that the show needed.
For example, I knew that I wanted to make the point in the show that generally life in Japan as a non-Japanese person is abrasive and challenging, before I made the point that the TV industry takes this to a ridiculous level. I could make that point in a number of ways. In the end I settled on a routine about buying fried chicken, but it could have been anything.
So that’s the first way: think of the story that you want to tell, then write routines and jokes in support of that end goal.
The second way is the opposite of this — think of your hour as five ten-minute routines, and find a way to make those five bits flow.
The advantage of this method is you probably have three or four ten-minute routines that you’re proud of, and you know work well. Your job during previews is to stitch them together. Try doing both routines as a twenty minute set, and see if you can merge the two, creating an A-plot and B-plot, adding callbacks, and merging your world creation. Try taking lines and tags from one routine and wedging them into another that works by making a tangent, or a simile, or comparison.
Do the show enough and you’ll realise that there is a narrative through line that just exists by virtue of the fact that it’s you who wrote the routines, and you would have had your own subconscious motivations to write them in the first place; it’s likely that many of your routines betray a unique and interesting principle or heuristic that’s obvious to you, but potentially interesting to your audience.
Once you’ve settled on your roughly fifty minutes of material (I say this because you want your show to run about 55 minutes, and the best way to do that is to have fifty fantastic minutes that you perform with enough poise and credibility that the material has space to breathe), it’s time to work out what the show actually is.
One way to approach this is to ask yourself “how would I like my audience to recommend my show to a friend?” A less cynical way of thinking about this exact same question is to appreciate that the audience won’t remember any of your material, but they will remember how they felt after the performance. What do you want that feeling to be? Critically examine every routine and work out whether it’s in service of this goal. If it isn’t — get rid.
A good way to stress test routines is to take them back into clubs and open mics. Even while previewing a show I’ll book in as many new material nights as I can, and see if I can perform the routines I’ve written out of the context of the show. It’s a quick way to find out if the premises are independently enjoyable and intriguing.
If you’ve booked in enough previews, and you get the sense that the iterative leaps from one preview to the next are getting smaller and smaller, then do some radical things to shake things up. Start with your closing routine and see what happens. Start bending the truth to see if it makes for a better story (consider changing chronologies, merging characters (i.e. if you talk about Mr. A in one routine and Mr. B in another, just make them the same person), raising the stakes, etc). No doubt you’ll be audio recording all your performances, but take a video camera too and see how your physicality can be improved.
Don’t do a census at the start of the show. Where they came from, who they came with, and their professions don’t matter one dot. Don’t get all meta and talk about the process of writing the show or “so this is my first hour, and I wanted to talk to you about…”. Just thank them for coming and start with a really funny routine.
This is a joke, but the reason that the ‘dead dad show’, and its tell-tale structure of having a sad bit happen two thirds in is because you need to pace your show while thinking about your audience’s energy and attention levels. Even if they weren’t watching four other shows either side of yours, your audience won’t want you to perform with the same energy for the duration of the show. Start to feel and intuit the moments where you pull back, recalibrate, and go for another round. Like having sex, I presume.
I made this mistake with my first hour, until a reviewer pointed it out. In the last ten minutes of the show, the story I was telling felt like it was concluding, but I went off on a little tangent because I had a nice handful of jokes that I wanted top put somewhere, and they sort of fitted. The show didn’t need it, and was better when I just cut it. If you’re on the home straight, don’t deviate.
If you’re listening back to a recording and more than 20–30 seconds has passed without the audience laughing, then you should re-write. If you need to let the audience know that your mum is old for the sake of a routine about age differences, don’t just say “My mum is old — she’s 87. She’s the same age as my friend’s grandparents, which means…”. Instead, try turning that premise into a joke. “My mum is old. She’s of the generation that put decorative plates on the walls, like your grandparent’s parents did.” there we have the premise, plus character exposition, and a laugh.
This is a hard one to explain, and is something I’ve only recently started doing, so maybe it’s too much to ask for a first fringe hour, but vibe up there. Don’t feel the need to do precisely the same show every day. Be playful and responsive and reactive. It’s not the end of the world if Thursday’s audience gets a slightly different show to Friday’s audience because you had an intrusive thought that you shared with the crowd (with we can only presume hilarious consequences). Be present, and let your persona and personality drive the show. You’re not presenting your material; you’ve written your material to present you.
If you’re doing a free or pay what you want show, consider doing your bucket speech before your final routine not after so people aren’t listening to you doing admin and thinking about needing a wee and how far they are away from their next show etc while you’re doing the important job of getting them to pay for the show they just watched for free.
No matter how silly, ironic, subversive or cynical your on stage persona is, don’t be anything other than sincere and authentic for the bucket speech. Explain the recommended cost for the show, then invite the audience to “pay for the show”. Not donate to the show, or contribute to your expenses, or whatever other work-devaluing apology you may have.
Be brutal about cutting stuff. Even if it’s brilliant. It won’t be wasted effort, you’ll find a use for it some day.
Once you’re fairly sure you’ve got a show, then treat every single performance as a fresh start. Just like rolling a dice, the chances of you hitting a six today are entirely independent to what you achieved yesterday. Don’t worry if you forgot a bit, did an act out wrong, messed up a few lines. The audience have absolutely no idea what they’re supposed to be seeing, so have no way of knowing if today was a ‘good one’ or not.
Just take your job as custodians of their happiness for an hour seriously, and you’ll do great.
The final—and probably most important—thing to remember is there literally are no rules in Edinburgh. If you’ve read any part of this and thought “oh well I cant’ do that then” then just ignore whatever made you think that.
All that matters is your audience. Care deeply about them, over-deliver on whatever promise you’ve made to them, and do the festival on your own terms.

Usually I try to write a snappy intro, but I’ve a bit of a headache and honestly the headline and deck have all the basics. Let’s get into it.

Tucked around the corner from Wembley Stadium is a more quirky arena: the setting for Enitan’s Game, a kid-friendly hour-long experience for Punchdrunkards (and other immersive enthusiasts) and their children. Telling the story of a family’s tradition of community play, visitors are quickly swept up in the frenzy of joining in one more round of the game invented by Enitan’s grandfather before his life celebration takes place.
I attend one of the standard sessions where children are expected, so while the kids take the lion’s share of participation and I don’t have much to do myself I’m still charmed and enthralled by the standard Punchdrunk-quality bells and whistles: the endearing pack-rat-yet-curated style of set design with light, sound, and haze all are there in the expert quality of execution we’ve come to expect. There’s a few surprising special effects: a Jumanji moment bewitches the group and elicits a few gasps from both generations, and there are one or two spooky moments that coast the edge between adolescence and mature thrills. I do have a couple calls to action but generally the grown-ups are there to watch the joy and wonder on the kids’ faces and to listen to the endearing story told by the two actors. There are adults-only sessions which welcome guests with a cocktail and close with a Q&A with members of the cast & creative team, but I’m assured by the host that the show runs exactly the same for both age groups; no changes to plot or acting style is made.
It’s prudent to note here that Punchdrunk Enrichment is a sister & separate company of Punchdrunk, and therefore while they share some fundamental members and elemental values they are not the same. Punchdrunk Enrichment’s design emphasis appears to be placed on gameplay and narrative, rather than the aesthetic and mature tones adult audiences have come to expect from sister company Punchdrunk; this is consistent with P.E.’s goal of creating experiences for education, community, and family audiences. Visitors would be wise to note this if planning a visit.
We’re all in favor of early indoctrination of the next generation of immersive enthusiasts & creators, and what better way than to pivot one of the biggest names in the game to get hold of ‘em early? Bring the kids (or borrow some) and start the journey together; Enitan’s Game is an ace in the hole.

Generative Artificial Intelligence. If it’s not telling you that adding glue will help the cheese stay on your pizza, it is producing art of eight fingered children or smoking monkeys.
Some people say it’s the future. Those people are wrong. The phrase “I asked ChatGPT where to buy a stamp” floats into my mind during quiet moments.
I tried to give ’The Waiting Room’ a chance. It’s Edinburgh Fringe. I want to experience experiments and risk taking. Creatives trying and sometimes failing. It’s so vital for immersive pieces to be developed and able to react and grow in response to audiences. But this is clinical. Cold. Am I supposed to be charmed that the robot can say my name?
There are previous AI based works I have enjoyed.“Saint Jude”, by Swamp Motel, made a delightful mix of interactive performance and communication with an artificial intelligence.
The show starts late. We hadn’t received the information we needed to bring headphones and smart phones. Then we can’t connect to the Internet in the venue. The AI generates stories slowly and the audience’s audio stories fall out of sync with each other. Being called up to get a note with a new task is not in sync with the AI telling us what to do.
We are in a Waiting Room to sell our digital avatar for use in adverts and political messages. Tasks are handed to us by a performer, wearing a paper mask for no explainable reason. “Write on the sticky note”, “take a selfie”. The AI has generated 24 mins of audio and “personal stories” based on my prompts.
Our audience is nervous, quiet. Long periods of silence.The performers seem unsure how to encourage us to interact. “Pick up a toy from a box and dance”. Why? What do I get out of this?
The purpose of a system is what it does. Immersive is beautiful in unique moments. This show isn’t a satirical look at a new form of art generation.
To paraphrase “I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.”
In the end the AI stated that my desire to be a marine biologist and my selling of beard oil made a “salty liquid for the face”.
Well.
Quite.

(It is worth noting that No Proscenium reviewed the online version of this work last year. But this was a chance to be in a real life space alongside the performers and live audience.)
Entering the hotel’s hall, containing a giant screen in the centre of the space, we are presented with a musician, to the side of a stage. This is ‘Non-Player Character’, a live musical taking place in virtual reality.
Performer and creator, Brendan Bradley (who played all the characters as well as singing throughout), welcomes us all and explains that, since the other company of performers hadn’t turned up, it was a chance to let our audience be involved in the show. I took the opportunity, so I am reporting my experience as a participant rather than an audience spectator.
Wearing Oculus headsets, I and three other audience members take on the avatars of colourful rock monsters. We have no legs and have blocky hands and faces. A giant grey being appears and mocks us for not doing anything. This is the Hero. He sings about how he is going to save the day, so we should watch. Then he is killed, leaving us alone with the Non Player Character. NPC falls into a deep depression now his friend is dead and we need to help him heal over the course of the musical.
A lot of the choices are made by the audience voting for the routes characters take as well as placing items into the space to interact with.
The VR, on the whole, held up. The NPC travels around the space and the songs echoed around us. NPC would ask questions and did a good job of handling the responses. A highlight was the green player who kept trying to get as close to NPC as possible.
Sometimes, it did just feel we were being dragged along by the narrative as we travelled from scene to scene. Sometimes we did the video game time fillers of trying to get stuck in holes, throwing rocks or just waving at each other. Which was quite wholesome.
Shows about grieving have become a common theme in this year’s Fringe. This was a wholesome and touching musical with impressive graphics and well performed live music and lyrics. For me, it was heightened by being able to participate in the action.

In the heart of Scotland, Edinburgh and Glasgow stand as contrasting siblings, each exuding their own brand of charisma. These cities are not just destinations; they are experiences, embroidered with history and buzzing with modern life.
Edinburgh — A Timeless Elegance Amidst a Dynamic Rhythm
Edinburgh, the capital, is a city of literary dreams and cobbled whispers. As you wander through its ancient lanes, the city feels like an open-air museum, each street a gallery, each building a testament to the past. The iconic Edinburgh Castle looms over the city like a guardian of history, while the Royal Mile stretches below, a procession route of heritage and tradition.
Yet, Edinburgh pulses with a youthful beat. The city’s historic heart flutters with the hustle of street performers, the clink of coffee cups, and the intellectual buzz of university life. There’s a juxtaposition here — the old-world charm of the Old Town, where every alleyway tells a story, against the New Town’s neoclassical grace, alive with chic boutiques and modern gastronomy.

Although my ancestry comes from Scotland, it was never that high on my travel list.
I’m not sure why — I guess other locations just sounded more exciting. So when my dad planned a trip for our family to explore Scotland, it sounded fun, but not like a place to cross off my bucket list.
That all changed when I got to the country.
Scotland was amazing; truly a place I could see myself living someday. I was shocked by how much I loved it — the people, the city, the country, the food, the atmosphere, everything.
We went all over, starting in Glasgow. That beautiful gothic city was quite the introduction to the country, but once we hopped on the train to head to our next destination, the Isle of Eriska on the western coast, we started to really see the beauty Scotland has to offer.
The Isle of Eriska was its own private island, complete with a unique, castle-style hotel, activities, and a spot to watch otters playing in the ocean at sunrise.
It was magical.
The rest of the trip was just as exciting, with multiple castle ruin tours, spending time on Loch Ness looking for the…

Photography Walks: Edinburgh, Scotland
Walk Two: A Picturebook of a Short Stay in Scotland’s capital
It started out as a treat for our 12 year old daughter. She wanted to see the pandas in Edinburgh Zoo which is 245 miles (395K) away! A fresh urgency to fulfilling this request was the forthcoming removal of the pandas back to China.
We decided that a couple of nights stay was required and set off early on day one. The delights of an Air B+B awaited us. We are non-smokers and chose a non-smoking flat. The previous visitors clearly had no regard for this and the flat stank. And in the second bedroom the broken blind was hidden in the wardrobe. Grrrr. Open windows, emergency window coverings, copious amounts of air freshener and complaints to the owner. Well, we’ll never stay there again! Air B+B has served us well over the years but not this time.
As well as the zoo and pandas our daughter’s idea of a good time is shopping for clothes. So after the zoo mum and daughter went shopping and I took the opportunity to wander with my camera and catch up with them here and there.
One thing we did together was to visit the Royal Yacht Britannia which is now a tourist attraction on Edinburgh’s docks. Retired…

I stood shivering next to the sea at Wardie Bay, a huge grin plastered across my face. I had just done my first ever cold dip. My husband was looking at me bemused, surprised I had actually done it (we both know I’m more of a cup-of-tea-on-the-sofa type). I felt emotional, thinking about all the life we had squeezed into the past year and aware that our time in Edinburgh was coming to an end.
In April 2024 I moved from London to Edinburgh and now, just a little over a year later, I have moved back.
When I told people about this move their first question would often be ‘have you moved for work?’ To which I would reply ‘no, I moved for fun and work moved with me!’ Relocating to Edinburgh wasn’t driven by a job offer and it wasn’t a strategic career move. It was a move led by life.
Our tenancy agreement in London was coming to an end, we weren’t quite ready to buy and when it came to thinking about where to rent next I floated a question: ‘shall we leave London?’
We toyed with some more exotic options, but settled on the land of the deep fried mars bar and tattie scone. This was partly because I had visited Edinburgh before and always felt at home in the city. But it was also partly practical: it’s English-speaking, there was much more likelihood of us keeping our jobs, it’s not too far and it’s low risk because as a tenant you can hand in your notice and leave within 28-days (yes, really… Scotland does things better).
Both Jason (the husband) and I got the move signed off by work, bundled our possessions into the car and journeyed north.
Although lots of people have been delighted by our move, some have been a bit perplexed. Aside from the fact that we chose Scotland (why not Lisbon or Paris or somewhere… sunny?), and the fact we made the move knowing it would be temporary (why go to all that effort?), there was a third oddity tugging at people’s minds: why did we move if it wasn’t for work?
I find that last reaction particularly interesting, as it hints at a wider cultural phenomenon. Today, a large part of our identity is tied up in what we do for a living. Even that phrase ‘for a living’ doesn’t really make sense anymore — do we really just work for a living? Or do we work for a sense of self, the desire for fulfilment and, in some cases, the drive to attain a certain social status?
There is, of course, a mounting counter-movement that is pushing back against the way work is swallowing our lives whole, for example the rise of the four-day work week, or the increase in remote-working — which is expected to grow 25% by 2030. Demand for jobs with flexibility is on the rise, suggesting that more of us want to fit work around life, rather than the other way around.
As someone who has pivoted their career to the social/ environmental impact sector, it would be quite ironic if I thought that working for a bigger purpose was a bad thing. Of course I don’t. But I do believe that you can be career-motivated in general, and still seek out life experiences that have nothing to do with job prospects and may, even, negatively impact your career, albeit temporarily.
The important point is that it’s not a zero-sum game, it’s a pendulum swing. Sometimes work leads, sometimes it’s adventure and sometimes other responsibilities will take the limelight. (Or at least that’s how I think it should be).
We rented a flat in New Town, working from there most days, occasionally taking our laptops to nearby coffee shops. My arrangement with work was that I would come down to London once a month and spend two days in the office (the typical policy is two days a week in office). When I was in London it was chaotic and jam-packed, but when I returned to Edinburgh it was quiet and much more spontaneous (thanks to few social obligations).
Overall though, I would do it again in a heartbeat.
Not everyone has the ability to up and move — whether due to work, medical needs or the reality of family life, so understandably this is a privileged position to be in.
If you are in a position to prioritise an adventure — however big or small — here are some tips:
My time in Edinburgh isn’t a footnote, it’s a full chapter in my book of life. I still care deeply about my work, especially when it comes to using my working life to make a positive difference (however small), but I also care about living with intention.
And if you’ve made it this far, maybe you’re ready to do the same.
Why not try…
There’s more where that came from, so if you’re planning a trip don’t be afraid to ask for recommendations!

I made a new friend by happenstance. Recently I accidentally destroyed an old, precious book of mine, and April Smith, owner of Booksmith Conservation, restores them for a living (beautifully, I might add). She also completed an archaeological dig at the Macedonia-Greece border in the 1990s (!!🤓) — one of the places I will expand my research to in the coming years. Plus, her job is so cool; I was friendly-jealous and mesmerized by the process of book preservation. She’s taking a trip to Scotland this summer, and I remembered that I have a list of spots and tips I curated a while back for friends visiting the Highlands and Edinburgh I haven’t shared here yet. I wrote this quickly, soon after my last trip there (pre-COVID), but I imagine many of the same general things still apply. So it’s a bit hodge-podge in style, structure, and content, but that’s because Scotland trips don’t really need to be planned — Scotland plans you.
Highlands Lodging:
One thing to keep in mind is that most bed and breakfasts in the Highlands are not yet online (weirdly) — so we thought Portree was all booked up before arriving, but you really can show up, and all the hundreds of B&Bs you pass will have either a “vacancy” sign or a “no vacancy” sign. It’s a nice system if you want to walk around a bit and meet the (very kind) owners, who are always willing to let you glance at the room and see if it’s charming enough to suit your needs before locking in the (very affordable) deal.
Basically, this is my way of saying don’t pre-book anything in the Highlands. Just follow your intuition and let yourself be guided by the lovely locals.
Highlands Info:
Oban is spectacular. It won’t be difficult, but be sure you catch the sunset there. It’s life changing. And if possible, have fish ‘n chips from a place that has fresh catches every day.
The Isle of Skye is also gorgeous —even if you have gray weather (like we did), it comes in spurts and doesn’t really rain that hard, so don’t let it keep you inside. Bring a billed rain jacket if you have one—it’s what everyone wears.
I don’t know where you’re planning to stay, but I strongly suggest having dinner in Portree at least once. There is such an impressive collection of high-end seafood restaurants concentrated there. We found a new one we recommend the highest — but I’m sure they are all good. There are several fish ‘n chips places, too — but I had the best fish ‘n chips I’ve ever had in the little take-it-to-go place in the center if Portree. You’ll notice it just by walking around for five minutes because Portree is small. They definitely have fresh fish every day, most often from only an hour ago. Add the salt and vinegar and order a side of any of the homemade sauces that you tend to like elsewhere (like tartar sauce or curry sauce).
If you want to do a tour of Talisker, you’ll have to book it in advance — our way of seeing the distilleries was actually to just go to the bar and order a flight. Talisker’s bar wasn’t finished yet, but if you’re interested in buying a bottle, they will give you a taste. Talisker is the famous one, though, so it's a bit touristy (still worth a stop!). I enjoyed the smaller distilleries better — they were friendlier and felt more Scottish.
In general, when driving, don’t be afraid to make unplanned stops along the way! We found several little hiking paths that were well-marked and let you choose via signposts “waterfall versus lair,” etc. all along the way. We also made an unplanned stop in the (very small) town of Sligachan on Skye where we could try any whisky our heart desired for very cheap. The town is basically a little rest stop close to Talisker, but worth spending some time in if you don’t get to do a tour of Talisker (we skipped it). In short, the Highlands are perfect for exploring.
I’m sure you will learn this when you arrive, but just to give you a taste of the mantra: “There are no trespassing laws in Scotland” — so you can literally walk anywhere, go through any gate, and explore wherever your heart desires. The farmers you meet encourage it — and seem to be proud of this aspect of Scotland. They will tell you if the bulls are out (and still, you can go through), but otherwise, they truly don’t mind you taking hikes through their incredible properties, which, together, make up Scotland. :)
Portree Restaurants:
I was told the best ones are №1 and Scorrybreac restaurants, but we didn’t book in advance, and in the summertime, they tend to be full, so we didn’t get to try them.
There are several restaurants nearby of a similar caliber, which we just walked past and begged for a reservation at dinner time (most were full).
We ended up trying Dulce and Brose with reservations one evening. It was overhyped but still tasty. We also tried another one by waiting in the bar area until they gave us a table — and it was so good that we added it to Google Maps and gave it its first 5-star review. It was seriously amazing. The name is Caroy House (it’s in cursive and super nondescript, so easy to miss, but worth finding!!). I recommend the smoked haddock risotto, the hake, the white wines they offer, and any of the desserts, really. It was spectacular. (Update from 2024: looks like it might be closed, thanks COVID).
Also, try the bakeries in Portree — and the little sandwich shops and savory pie places (anywhere, really, if you see a nice-looking pie).
EDINBURGH (EDI)
Italian:
1. For a very fancy night, you could try for a reservation at Locanda De Gusti (102 Dalry Rd). The food is top-notch homemade Italian; but it’s a small place so I’d guess that they are full already for the dates you’re there. Still worth a try!
2. For a very close second, make a reservation at a place Divino Enoteca (5 Merchant St). This place is large, so it almost always can fit you in for a same-night reservation, but it still has low, gorgeous lighting and punch-you-in-the-face, delicious food.
3. Finally, if you haven’t had a chance to try one of Jaimie Oliver’s restaurants elsewhere in the UK, it’s always a decent option. Jaimie’s Italian (54 George Street) is technically a chain, but it still serves pretty remarkable and creative Italian food. It’s a good lunch option if you’re staying nearby, but it's not worth trekking to.
Indian:
There is incredible Indian options all over Edinburgh, and I’m yet to try a bad one.. but these are the ones I’ve tried and would highly recommend. Regardless of whether you’re into spicy food or not, these places are a life experience:
1. Dishoom Edinburgh (3a St Andrew Square): This place started in London but has a few more now because of how perfect it is. Small plates, try-everything sort of style + delicious and seriously amazing cocktails. Matt and I decided to eat here twice in one week once, and I would have eaten there again. Tip — ask to eat downstairs if they will let you! The vibe of the bar seating is cooler (both metaphorically and literally) than the upstairs, which gets very hot in the summertime.
2. Tuk Tuk Indian Street Food: a hipster-style BYOB place that is quick, easy, and delicious.
3. Kamasutra Indo Tapas Restaurant (16 Drummond St) — this place is a little further out (and by further out, it’s like a 20 min. walk from George Street versus everything else), but that might turn out to be a good thing if other places are fully booked. It’s strikingly good and affordable too.
4. Ghurka Cafe (27 Cockburn St) is the first Indian place I discovered, so it has a very special place in my heart. I’ve taken every guest who visited me in Edi, and it was always a crowd pleaser. It’s a no frills kind of place (for instance, I think they only serve beer and average quality wine), but the flavors of the food are so good it will make you want to lick your plate clean (my not-so-new friend Mary’s son memorably did this). And it’s actually Nepalese so the dishes are really close to northern Indian dishes, very rich and pleasing. The location is super central and usually quite full, but somehow, they have always managed to fit me in without a reservation. (Still, make one if you can!)
Scottish:
1. Arcade Bar, Haggis & Whisky House (48 Cockburn St): This is a delicious lunch spot. For an easy entrance into the world of haggis, try the haggis nachos. If you are all-in, order the traditional style full plate haggis. Grab a dram of whisky here, too, if you’re feeling it — they have everything. The service is a little slow as they are often understaffed, but it’s such a pleasant atmosphere inside + perfect food that you won’t mind. :)
2. Fish n’ Chips: You’ll have plenty of opportunities for fresh fish n’ chips in the Highlands, so you might not want it in Edinburgh in lieu of other options, but if you do, my only advice is to get it from a small, low-key sort of place you notice somewhere that clearly gets fresh fish every day and not from a pub.
3. The Edinburgh Larder (15 Blackfriars St): simple but locally-sourced, delicious breakfast cafe/deli.
4. Oink (34 Victoria St): This place roasts an entire pig every day and makes these delicious (reasonably sized) sandwiches with various homemade toppings such as sweet potato mash, cranberry sauce, apple sauce, haggis, etc. It’s Matt’s favorite “snack” in Edinburgh.
5. Indigo Yard (7 Charlotte Ln): This place has delicious beers on tap and really impressive food. I guess it’s called a gastropub? The atmosphere is really nice — make a reservation if you can, and if you just show up, they might be able to squeeze you into the garden/bar area.
EDI Cocktails:
There is an underground cocktail place in Edinburgh called Panda & Sons — the outside looks like an old-style barber shop, but if the door’s not already open, just open it and go downstairs (Update: I later learned this is called a Speakeasy 😂) . I’ll let the rest be a surprise. It was recently rated in the top ten for good cocktails in Europe. Weekends can be really packed, but the cocktail will still be perfect every time, and the vibes are always great.
EDI Sweets:
Mary’s Milk Bar. I’m not big on sweets, and I initially thought I was just noticing this place because it has my name on it. But one day, I tried it, and now, I can confidently say it’s one of the few sweet places I would wait in line for — each flavor is a masterpiece! I saw only after I’d been that it made it onto Somebody Feed Phil’s Scotland episode. 💁‍♀️ (Thanks for recommending that show incidentally, sister Ellen!)
EDI Tourist spots:
1. The Castle: You can walk to see the entrance of the castle without paying the fee to get in ($18). It is worth it to go in if you have a free afternoon. It’s not a pop-in experience though. If you go, I would recommend touring half of it, taking a good long break in the cafe, and then touring the rest. There’s just so much to see; it’s all so remarkable; and it’s much more enjoyable at a leisurely pace.
2. Holyrood Palace: I’ve never been inside, but I have been told it is epic.
3. Royal Yacht Britannia: If you have an extra day, I would recommend this option highly. Especially if you are even vaguely swayed by the drama of the royal family (isn’t everyone when it gets right down to it?). If you’ve watched the Crown, book your tickets NOW. It is a big thing to get there if I remember correctly — I think we split a taxi?? — I don’t remember. But if you have the time, I definitely recommend it. If you’re days are limited, it’s not worth missing a day in EDI for though.
4. Calton Hill (at day or night) + graveyards + Arthur’s seat: This is my top recommendation for Edinburgh. Just put on some comfortable shoes and walk around Edinburgh.. follow windy stone streets.. especially the little alleys (which are called “closes”). Get lost. You’re allowed to follow any of the closes that catch your eye. Read about the history of closes if you’re interested. And if you think the history of closes is fascinating…
5. …take a guided tour of the famous, the real, Mary King’s Close. You’ll get the full history of the original design of the city and be able to see it underground, fully preserved from ancient times. (This is the only guided tour I’d recommend, but I’m not really that into guided tours.. I’m sure there are other great ones in Edinburgh, and probably even free ones with various themes.)
6. The Royal Mile: This could be absolutely packed with people in the summertime, so it may be hard to get perspective on the layout with the crowds, but it’s pretty remarkable to see nonetheless. Both amazing and average street performers congregate there, practicing for Fringe season, and there will be hundreds of free shows every day.
7. Live music will be abundant.
8. Grassmarket is a good neighborhood as well for seeing street performers and will be slightly less crowded than the touristy spots of EDI. I also like the Queen Street Gardens neighborhood. The museums close to Queen Street Gardens are both free and have a very impressive art collection.
9. Fringe: If you’re going in August, you will run into the chaos that is the Fringe Festival. Most people from EDI leave for the festival but if you brave it, but you should definitely get ahold of a Fringe magazine when you arrive, even just to see the enormity of the event. I find it pretty overwhelming, actually and ended up just choosing a few highly recommended shows — such as some of the acrobatic ones, comedy shows, burlesque, etc. and then leaving the rest of my time open for walking in and out of free shows. Basically, every single venue in Edinburgh will have a show of some sort. It’s fun for a day or two, but like Vegas, the feeling of awe wears off almost as quickly as it comes.
In general, I’d recommend visiting EDI literally any month besides August.
EDI Lodging:
I would suggest booking a place in EDI in advance — just to be sure you get to stay in a comfortable spot in the center.
My favorite place to stay is actually a hostel called Kickass Hostel. If you’re there with 2–3 people, ask to book a private room with a view of the castle. It’s really amazing — especially if you don’t mind a basic room and shared bathrooms (Update: I’m kind of past the point of sharing bathrooms). But either way, they have a comfy cafe where you can hang out and plan your EDI day.
Or not. Because plans, like the land, are made to be trespassed through in Scotland.

Final tips: take a few pics and write down some of the places you fall in love with unexpectedly (share with me) — and most of all, enjoy!

Edinburgh’s decline into a theme park has been charted for years, and the recent victory to Save the People’s Story stands out as an exception against a backdrop of relentless social cleansing, homelessness (the Scottish capital is home to the largest number of people living in temporary accommodation) and culture-washing.
The city’s problems are structural — it is a city of capital rather than a capital city. It’s purpose is hard-wired into its streets and architecture. As William McIlvanney writes in his novel Strange Loyalties, Edinburgh was:
“…built to be a Hanoverian clearing-house of the Scottish identity. The very street names declare what’s happening, like an announcement of government policy in stone: you have Princes Street and George Street and Queen Street with, in among them, Hanover Street and Rose Street and Thistle Street. Any way you count it, the result is the defeat of Scottishness. This was an identity superimposed on the capital of Scotland, an attempted psyche-transplant: ‘Scottishness may have been a life but Britishness can be a career.’
But if Edinburgh’s problems are historic, and symbolic, it is not helped by its current leadership. We know that Cammy Day was forced to resign from his job as leader of the Labour administration in the capital following allegations he had bombarded two Ukrainian refugees with multiple messages on social media. The councillor, who was suspended by his party last weekend, faces a police investigation into claims he acted “inappropriately”.

It is Friday, the beginning of May, my usual morning to write my blog and I’m sitting in a hotel room in Edinburgh, Scotland. The sky is blue and cloudless and the air is a crispy 47°F.
My usual routine back home is placing my computer on the dining room table, quieting my mind and giving thanks while my Doodle Abbey rests at my feet. Today, I sit on a comfy bed with pen and paper. I asked for divine guidance and inspiration.
In response, I hear, “ You are beautiful.”
One of my favorite songs is “ Beautiful” by Gordon Lightfoot, a tune and lyrics that touch my heart. “You are so beautiful. I was made for you and you were made for me.”
Imagine God/Source/our Creator saying to you, my brother Bob, Marilyn, Ann, Alena, Paulette, Michael….all of us “You are beautiful.” Tears fill my eyes and joy fills my heart. Hear the words…. “ I was made for you and you were made for me.”
We are all the same energy made for each other, across continents across lifetimes and realities.
Hold that, feel it. Don’t let anything else in. You, your essence, your light, you, you are beautiful.
How does it feel to walk through your days as “ I am beautiful” versus “I am human, I am flawed, I have issues, blah, blah, blah.”
Try it, now, today, all day, all month. For the month of May, tell yourself I am beautiful.
Look for beauty, everywhere, every day in this month of May and write it down.
“Through rain or shine for such a long time. I’m telling you, you are beautiful.”
You’ve been beautiful since the day you were born and before.
It would mean so much to me if you would experience this. If you would close your eyes, take a deep breath, listen carefully and feel the powerful love given to you by three words “You are beautiful .”
With a smile on my face and joy in my heart, I am off to explore Edinburgh. Enjoy your Friday. Happy May!!

One of the most striking features of Edinburgh is its weather, especially during the autumn and rain season. The misty rain often adds a sense of mystery to the old town, enhancing its fantasy-like appeal. Autumn in Edinburgh brings a palette of rich golds, browns, and reds, with the crisp air carrying the scent of fallen leaves and wet earth. The city’s vintage buildings…

Update: the Principal Edinburgh Charlotte Square hotel is now the Kimpton Charlotte Square. Read the new review here.
With a castle view, a garden room indoors, and a gentleman’s travel collection on display, The Principal Edinburgh Charlotte Square is simply the most remarkable place to stay in New Town.
I blew into the hotel on a gusty early evening unprepared to be immediately charmed by this hotel. But charmed I was. The outside is grand while staying coyly understated. The Principal inhabits seven gorgeous Georgian townhouses and has been fastidiously refurbished with both expected and unexpected details.
Although I loved the masculine entry hall, I was distracted by the restaurant during check-in. Previously an outdoor courtyard, it is now an indoor garden room with a glass ceiling reminiscent of an atrium, draped in hanging ferns and styled with garden furniture. My husband and I enjoyed a full breakfast here both mornings of our stay and noticed happy chatting groups when we came in late in the evening. Another restaurant with a completely different vibe is tucked away at one end of the hotel. BABA serves food with an Eastern Mediterranean flair sprinkled with local staples, such as Scottish beef. At a contrast to The Garden, BABA is dipped in deep greens, reclaimed wood and wool rugs. Its moody evening feel is exciting, even before you see a menu.
Our tour of the room included a story — how Scottish! If The Principal was a person, he’d be Hamish, a gentleman with fine tastes who travels the world looking for the best of it. He’s collected books, textiles and trinkets which he displays on shelves for the pleasure of his guests. Just like the front desk staff, I picture Hamish as friendly and warm — as welcoming as this hotel.
As this was my first time staying at The Principal family of hotels, I was delighted with the complimentary sweets and savory snacks in the tuck box. The red corded telephone by the bedside was adorable as well, adding to the eclectic mix of old and new that works so flawlessly here. I was delighted to see that books are available to borrow from the front desk and hot tea is as easy to find as whisky. Some rooms have the best view in the country, a view of Edinburgh Castle. Even knowing this before I arrived, it was still breathtaking.
If you only have one day in this beguiling city, do these three things within walking distance of the hotel:
1. Visit the most besieged fortress in Great Britain, Edinburgh Castle. Try the Millionaire Shortbread in the café.
2. Tour the homes (now underground) of the average citizen during the time of the plague. I recommend The Real Mary King’s Close Underground Tour.
3. Eat at The Elephant House to absorb the ambience of the place where J.K. Rowling wrote much of the first Harry Potter book.
There’s only one place to stay in Edinburgh with such abundant charms and comforts, The Principal Edinburgh Charlotte Square. My thanks to Simon Willis and Tara D’Agostino for their kind assistance with this story.

Liberal Arts Blog — Sunday is the Joy of Humor, Food, Travel, Practical Life Tips, and Miscellaneous Day
Today’s Topic: Scotland (Part One) A Little Geography, Five Battles, Edinburgh (including the Castle and the Fringe)
Last time, the fourth and final part of a series on the counties of Ireland. Today, on to Scotland, but first a re-cap.
On 2/23 we covered the Dublin of James Joyce and Leopold Bloom, Trinity College, the Ha’penny, Samuel Beckett, and O’Connell bridges, and St. Stephen’s Green, On 2/16 we investigated Northern Ireland including Belfast, the “Peace Walls,” the “Giant’s Causway” and Finn McCool. On 2/9, the central west (Galway, Mayo, Sligo) featuring the Aran jumper, Boycott, and Yeats. On 2/2 the southwest (Cork, Kerry, and Clare) and the stories of Daniel O’Connell (the emancipator of Catholics) and Michael Collins (independence leader who fought in the Easter Rebellion and was assassinated in an ambush at age 31 in 1922).
Now — the land of lochs and firths, of highlands, lowlands, and uplands, of the Shetlands, the Orkneys, and the inner and outer Hebrides, of Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen, of Robert Burns, William
Wallace, James Watt, James Clark Maxwell, Adam Smith, and Andrew Carnegie. And of the great clans — the MacKenzies, the Campbells, the Macleods, Stewarts, Douglases, Sinclairs, Macleans , Wallaces, MacGregors, Fergusons, and Gordons.
Are you Scottish? Have you been? Have you studied or lived there? What do you know about the northern third of island of Great Britain that the rest of us might not but would delight to learn?
Experts — please chime in. Correct, elaborate, elucidate.
GEOGRAPHY AND DEMOGRAPHY — note that firths are coastal inlets (like fjords) and lochs are lakes as in the famous story of the Loch Ness monster and the love song “Loch Lomond”
1. Scotland accounts for roughly a third of the island of Great Britain but has a population of only 5.5 million or about 8% of the United Kingdom. England: 56 million, Wales 3.2 million, Northern Ireland 1.9 million.
2. The border with England is only 92 miles long — as compared to its coastline of 6160 miles.
3. The North Channel separating Scotland from Northern Ireland is only 13 miles wide between the Mull of Kintyre in Scotland and Torr Head in Northern Ireland.
NB: 80% of Scotlands population is in the central lowlands which includes Glasgow (1 million) Edinburgh (half a million), Dunferline, Stirling, Perth, and Dundee.
FIVE HISTORIC BATTLES — Stirling Bridge (1297) Bannockburn (1314), Falkirk (1298), Folloden (1513), Culloden (1746)
1. Stirling Bridge (1297) William Wallace (1270–1305) and Andrew Moray (1265–1297) defeat English. Moray died of wounds from the battle. Wallace was later hanged, drawn, and quartered. Mel Gibson played Wallace in the film “Braveheart” (1995)
2. Bannockburn (1314) Robert Bruce defeats English leading ultimately to Scottish independence in 1328.
3. English victories against the Scots included: Falkirk (1298) Folloden (1513), and Culloden (1746).
The last English monarch to be killed in battle was James IV at the battle of Folloden. The Battle of Culloden ended the Jacobite rebellion which attempted to restore the Stuart monarchy. It was the last pitched battle on British land and resulted in mass evictions from ancestral lands, the banning of the tartan, and the disarming of the people.
EDINBURGH — THE CITY WITH A VOLCANIC PLUG IN THE MIDDLE UPON WHICH STANDS A CASTLE AND LEADING UP TO IT “THE ROYAL MILE” THROUGH THE “OLD TOWN” — have you been to the Edinburgh Fringe?
1. Edinburgh is bounded to the north side by the Firth of Forth and to the south side by the Pentland Hills.
2. “Recognized as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is the seat of the Scottish Government, the Scottish Parliament, the highest courts in Scotland, and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official residence of the monarch in Scotland.”
3. “The city has long been a centre of education, particularly in the fields of medicine, Scottish law, literature, philosophy, the sciences and engineering. The University of Edinburgh, founded in 1582 and now one of three in the city, is considered one of the best research institutions in the world. The financial center of Scotland, Edinburgh is the second-largest financial centre in the United Kingdom, the fourth largest in Europe, and the thirteenth largest internationally.”
NB: The Edinburgh Fringe is the “world’s largest performance arts festival which in 2024 spanned 25 days, sold more than 2.6 million tickets and featured more than 51, 446 scheduled performances of 3,746 different shows across 262 venues from 60 different countries. Of those shows, the largest section was comedy, representing 40% of shows, followed by theater, which was 26.6% of shows.” (see below)

Many years ago, I became the proud supervisor of not one, not two, but THREE PhD students and a part-time research assistant. Hurray me — I had a lab!
Now, clearly the word “lab” conjures images of test tubes and centrifuges, pipettes and petri dishes. Our research group has none of these things. But over time, the group of people associated with a given principal investigator (like me) and their shared resources (in our case, bubble guns and laptops rather than beakers and lab coats) has come to be known as a lab in a lot of scientific disciplines.
For us, the concept of the lab means a group of people who take an interest in each other’s work, help each other out when we’re stuck, and share ideas, resources and office space. We have a Code of Conduct to help set clear expectations for members of the group, and meet monthly to swap our latest news. Twice a year we have a half-day away day, sometimes focused on professional development and sometimes on just hanging out and having fun. Last autumn we had a session on writing a thesis and preparing for viva, but the most recent one included a foraging walk and then board games in a cafe!
My first challenge when deciding that my little team qualified as a lab group, was to come up with a name. I went to the pub with my husband and wrote down a series of keywords that described the work we were doing, and then saw which of these could be combined into a satisfactory and pronounceable acronym. And lo! DART was born — standing for development, autism, research, technology. Of course, I could have gone down the well-trodden path of the “Fletcher-Watson Lab” but honestly… *shudders*
Fast forward almost a decade and DART no longer seems like a suitable name for our little gang. “Research” has always bothered me as a keyword — I mean, obviously, we are researchers. “Autism” feels too narrow for what we do nowadays, which has a much broader focus on developmental diversity and trying to do work which is relevant and useful for multiple diagnosed and undiagnosed people. And it’s been a few years since I last did a project I could call “technology”.
So back to the drawing board, but roughly the same technique… Collectively we suggested words and — in a stroke of luck — this time we managed to organise them into an acronym that works for our largely-psychological research: MIND for mental health, interaction, neurodiversity, development. MIND though — there’s an awful lot of organisations out there with MIND as a name. That didn’t seem a good idea on its own, so Edinburgh MIND then?? Or maybe, there’s a chance to be clever and insert one more keyword into it all…
And so, the Edinburgh Inclusive MIND lab it is, or EdInMIND for short.
Nowadays this group has a rolling cast of about 10–16 members, as grant funding waxes and wanes. It is co-led by me and my close colleague, Catherine Crompton. While Catherine and I are both part of the Salvesen Mindroom Research Centre, our lab group is diverse and spans multiple parts of the University of Edinburgh — members may have a primary affiliation in the Division of Psychiatry, School of Philosophy Psychology and Language Sciences, Child Life and Health, Centre for Reproductive Health or Moray House School of Education and Sport. This diversity of perspective is one reason why we feel it’s important to have a lab identity which reflects our shared focus.
If you want to find out more about what we’re up to, the best gateway will be on this page where we link out to more specific projects and information — and back here, if you fancy going in a circle!

When I stepped foot in Edinburgh a few decades ago, I immediately fell in love with the place. That first sight of the city will never leave me, and I still adore how it holds its head high. Along with being beautiful, it is a highly educated and cultured city and has more graduates as a percentage than virtually any other place on the planet. It also hosts world-class innovation and research. While its infrastructure is never at a scale that the mighty London can achieve in terms of innovation, it is livable, walkable, and a fairly safe place to live.
In the city, I feel the ghosts of the past and of the great scientists, academics, business leaders and engineers who helped build the city and the country. This city, a few hundred years ago, showed the world how to take an enlightened approach to science and knowledge creation. In my university, too, I get to walk through John Napier’s Tower, and have the chance to convert his logarithms into something that provides the core of the security of the Internet — discrete logarithms.
And, for my PhD, I studied the work of James Clerk-Maxwell, and who’s created a unified theory for electromagnetic waves.
And, so, today, I am honoured to be elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE) [here], and share a space with those who have truly advanced Scotland as a country. As you should possibly know, Scotland has a long track record for punching above its weight in terms of invention and enterprise. Current fellows include many great scientists and engineers who have made Scotland their home, such as Peter Higgs and Jocelyn Bell Burnell. Former fellows include James Clerk-Maxwell and James Watt, along with the inventor of the TV:
And I love the entry for Benjmin Franklin, ad who is “interested in Electricity”:
But, for me, the mightiest of all, and possibly one of the greatest scientists of all time is James-Clerk Maxwell:
As you can see he was born in Edinburgh, and studied at the Edinburgh Academy and at the University of Edinburgh. After he graduated, he became a Professor at Aberdeen University, and then onto Kings College and Cambridge.
Education has given me everything in my career. For those starting out in their career, my core advice is to advance your education as much as you can, and achieve your full potential. No matter your background, if you have a desire to succeed, you will in the end. In fact, never stop learning, and advance yourself every single day. And don’t just learn from a superficial point-of-view; dive in and learn things deeply. If you can, read up on the classic research paper that built your field and understand the current barriers that need to be broken down. Research is great fun and can have a great impact … so go make a dent in this world (Steve Jobs quote). So, go do that MSc or PhD that you have always wanted to do.
This city and this country have given me everything that I would ever want in my career. They have helped shape our research and teaching, and they have been there to support us in building up collaborations, in supporting partnerships, and in allowing us the space to grow. To share a space that James-Clerk Maxwell once occupied is a privilege I will never forget. I am so lucky, too, as I get to research and teach the subjects that I love (cryptography and cybersecurity) and teach students who will build our future.

An Edinburgh Christmas Ghost Story — tales from the graveyards of the Necropolis of the North,https://medium.com/@DuncanHynd/an-edinburgh-christmas-ghost-story-tales-from-the-graveyards-of-the-necropolis-of-the-north-61a8d7150fb6,"Sign up

Our dead are never dead to us until we have forgotten them — George Eliot.
In the dark corners of the burial grounds of early 19th Century Edinburgh, the Necropolis of the North as I like to call it, two entrepreneurial men met a rapidly rising demand for human bodies to be used for anatomical dissection. Using human remains for medical research was illegal in the UK and banned in much of Europe or extremely limited for what were largely religious reasons.
To that end and to practice their surgical skills and enhance their anatomical knowledge doctors were only allowed to dissect bodies of executed criminals, people deceased in prison and oddly, orphans or people who had died with no fixed abode. As medical schools became more common, the supply and demand for dead bodies exceeded a state of economic equilibrium and so people resorted to body snatching or when that resource dried up, murder — to keep the cold medical school mortuary shelves and marble slabs well stocked.
Step forward William Burke and William Hare!
At the time Edinburgh was the leading European city for anatomical research and so the aptly named ‘resurrection men’ robbed fresh graves of their homo sapiens contents until relatives decided to take matters into their own hands and essentially lock the grave and coffin shut using what were termed ‘mort-safes’ of which some fine examples still exist in the infamous Greyfriars Kirkyard and others. These enclosed the grave, tomb or mausoleum in heavy duty wrought iron bars and locks, that even todays gangs that run around London with battery powered angle grinders to steal expensive bikes would struggle to cut open. The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh is still famed the world over as a leading surgical training today but by physically locking up the dead within their individual burial chamber, the supply of corpses rapidly dried up.
Out of interest, Surgeons’ Hall in Edinburgh, is the headquarters of the aforementioned Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and houses the Surgeons’ Hall Museum with anatomical displays and surgical equipment which is well worth a visit when you’re in town. There is also a library and archive of the colleges work.
The present Surgeons’ Hall was designed by Edinburgh’s leading light architect William Henry Playfair and completed in 1832, and is a category A listed structure while Playfair will feature in my tales of Edinburgh graveyards shortly and so please don’t change channels just yet!
The museum is recognised as a collection of national significance by the Scottish Government and very popular with tourists and locals alike.
Measures to ensure graves were left undisturbed, such as the use of mort-safes (I did research deadlock and mortice lock for this piece but there is no evidence that the etymological beginning of these names are at all linked to the subject matter but they sound like they should be) only made the shortage of cadavers even worse and so the indigenous vagrant population quickly became lambs to the slaughter and all for a princely sum of around £7 which would be worth around £1,000 today and so not to be ‘sniffed’ at.
When the New Calton Burial Ground was built as an overspill and operational replacement to the Old Calton Burial Ground just half a mile to its east on Regent Road due to Waterloo Place being built, a special watchtower was built, specifically to stop people grave robbing, such was the commercial opportunity on offer!
The murders started after a tenant in one of Hare’s properties died suddenly and the pair sold the body to Dr Robert Knox who was a celebrated lecturer of anatomy and a zoologist, ethnologist and medical doctor in the city and who had established the above-mentioned museum of anatomy and pathology. Another lodger, suffering from a cold was killed for literally sniffing too much and putting off other potential tenants from renting rooms and so the murders continued with the tacit approval of Burkes wife and Hare’s partner and no doubt partly to support their increasingly extravagant and expensive lifestyle. They were caught when the body of Margaret Docherty was discovered who was suspected to have been suffocated but at that time, no one could prove this.
Hare was granted immunity from prosecution and so by way of the use of Kings evidence he provided the details of Docherty’s murder and confessed to all sixteen deaths colloquially known then as the West Port Murders while charges were laid against Burke and his wife for three of the deaths.
At trial Burke was found guilty of just one murder and sentenced to death. The case against his wife was found not proven. Burke was hanged shortly afterwards and his cadaver was dissected and his skeleton displayed at the anatomical museum of the Edinburgh Medical School.
Robert Knox was never charged with his connection to the murders despite public outcry but his reputation in Edinburgh was irreparably damaged and so in time the Royal College of Surgeons forced him to resign as the curator of their anatomical museum.
The Burke and Hare case hugely raised public awareness of the need for cadavers for medical research and contributed to the passing of the Anatomy Act of 1832 that gave surgeons and students legal access to bodies from workhouses, hospitals and prisons that were unclaimed 48 hours after death. It was also made possible for a person to donate a next of kin’s body for medical research. It was essentially ratified in response to public outrage at the illegal trade in corpses.
The Arthur’s Seat 17 small coffins discovery
Robert Louis Stevenson died in 1894 and is buried on Mount Vaea, its summit overlooking Apia, the capital of Samoa. Many years before he died, he composed his own epitaph — ‘Under the wide and starry sky, Dig the grave and let me lie. Glad did I live and gladly die, and I laid me down with a will’.
Stevenson, as we know was a world-renowned Scottish novelist and is best known for Treasure Island, The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Kidnapped among many other books, poems, essays and travel guides. The son of Thomas Stevenson and grandson of Robert, a family famed for building lighthouses and other civil engineering feats suggested that he acquired his love of writing from his mother’s side of the family, the Balfours. His alma mater was Edinburgh University and while his paternal family were reticent about him taking on a life as a wordsmith and not an engineer, the rest as they say is history aside from the equally ‘strange case’ of 17 tiny coffins.
In June 1836, a group of boys were rabbiting on Arthur’s Seat, when they came across a small cave on the North East side, its entry covered by a stone and inside they found 17 miniature wooden coffins along with some tiny, carved figures clothed in delicate but bespoke outfits. These are now on show at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.
It has been mooted many times that these coffins are in some way a memorial to the 16 victims of Burke and Hare and as Burke was hanged in 1829 that made 17 deaths and indeed 17 coffins, others suggest they’re linked to some form of witchcraft.
However, in 2014, the museum was sent a package containing another small coffin with a small body with an accompanying note containing a long quote from Robert Louis Stevenson’s work — The Body Snatchers, which was part inspired by the Burke and Hare murders. Spooky indeed!
Greyfriars Bobby and the ghostly kirkyard.
There is no doubt that the most ‘popular’ graveyard in the Auld Reekie is at Greyfriars Kirk and probably because of a certain pet dog and not a famous human being although being what some term ‘the most haunted place in Edinburgh’ does get the tourists flooding in and it’s all for free as our all the main galleries and museums in this great, but increasingly ‘Disneyfied’ city.
The existing church on the site was built in 1602, and people have been buried here before then, including James Hutton, who famously stated that ‘we find no vestige of a beginning — no prospect of an ending’ and was part of Edinburgh’s period of ‘Enlightenment’. He realised that the earth was far older than current religious beliefs of the time allowed for and spoke out about this despite having to defer to the status quo and John Porteous, who was the drill master of Edinburgh’s city guard. When an infamous smuggler was hung in 1736, people rioted and he was given an order to shoot over them but as things worsened, he asked the soldiers to fire on the mob, killing many. He was charged, imprisoned at the Tollbooth, captured by the angry throng and then lynched, ending up buried at Greyfriars a day later. You can read more about this in my blog that features ‘Heart of Midlothian’ by Walter Scott which features this historic event and local football team the Jam Tarts and also my boyhood heroes Spurs.
From Waverley to White Hart Lane:
https://medium.com/@DuncanHynd/from-waverley-to-white-hart-lane-d083327faa2b
Rumour has it that it could be the most haunted graveyard in the world and is named after a Franciscan Friary located on the site but no longer stands there and aside from the above famous people interred also contains the burial places of some grave robbers too.
One angry, even violent apparition that has been allegedly seen and heard by late night revellers, legend has it is a certain George MacKenzie who was a tormentor of a religious group of 17th-century Presbyterians. Apparently, his ghostly form was freed when a tramp broke into his tomb and he has been on the rampage ever since.
Another often mentioned Greyfriars spectre is that of Edinburgh surgeon James Borthwick who died in 1675 and who bizarrely by today’s standards was the initial teacher of anatomy in a special society of barbers and surgeons! I guess this makes sense as both used sharp instruments to either shave people or operate on them or both if they wanted them dead and likely where the name cut throat razor came from!
A member of the Scottish Parliament, Borthwick was responsible for the creation of the ‘Surgeon-Apothecary’ group in Edinburgh as he served his internship as what would be a modern day pharmacist initially and was then incorporated as a surgeon unusually without first having served a surgical apprenticeship but as the city had been gripped by the plague, membership levels where very low. His speciality was as an anatomy teacher to student surgeons when human dissection was a much needed but often dark art.
By way of an Edinburgh council remit in 1657, the Surgeon- Apothecary group were granted permission to work on patients as until then the surgeons and apothecaries had completely different areas of practice.
Borthwick died in 1676 and is buried in this infamous grave yard, his monument adorned with a life size, crazy, dancing skeleton carrying a scythe in the style of Father Time, a royal crown and the skull and cross bones, with an array of surgical devices displayed on the sides!
James Hutton the geologist mentioned above is buried in desecrated land that was once the ‘Covenantor’s Prison’ that held circa 1,200 prisoners in around 1679, people who were so called militant Presbyterians and believed in what was known as the National Covenant and whom George MacKenzie, representing the Crown but in his human form, persecuted. Some simply died in the grounds, some were executed for treason, some escaped, and some were freed after signing a bond of loyalty to the Crown and shipped via the Port O’Leith to the US.
If you like Harry Potter, Tom Riddell’s villainous monument is located here too.
The graveyard is famously, from a tourist’s perspective, forever associated with the legend of Greyfriars Bobby, a dog who guarded his dead owner’s grave for 14 years and who has a burial headstone at the entrance. There is a statue and water fountain of Bobby, whose brass nose is now very worn out at the corner of Edinburgh’s Candlemaker Row and George IV Bridge and ridiculously popular for selfies as shown above.
Depending on the narrative you believe, and there are quite a few the dog was either a Skye Terrier or a Dandie Dinmont, who died on 14 January 1872. The best-known variation is that Bobby belonged to John Gray, who worked for the Edinburgh City Police as a night-watchman, with Bobby his formal watch-dog. Gray, under other popular pseudonyms was a farmer, a gardener or other!
Lastly, the churchyard has claimed the burial of other historic figures such as Scottish architect William Adam, its first famous post humous occupant how famously designed Hopetoun House near Edinburgh and Duff House, very close to where I live out the spring and summer months in Banff on the Moray Firth to William Wright, who was a Scottish physician, botanist, infamously part of the slave trade and joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
The leading architect of Edinburgh’s iconic buildings and graves gave his named to a popular pub too!
William Henry Playfair who infamously has a Wetherspoons pub named after him on Piccardy Place by the Vue cinema complex as a posthumous badge of honour was both a leading designer of landmark buildings and largely big-statement and non-conformist tombs in the Auld Reekie, mainly found in the remarkable Dean Cemetery, located high above the Water of Leith and the tourist hotspot that is Dean Village.
Born in 1790, Playfair died in 1857 and is buried in the same grave yard where some of his best work can be seen such as his pink pyramid tomb that inters Lady Sophia Rutherford and her husband Andrew Rutherford who was, among other illustrious jobs, the Lord Advocate of Scotland. His wife, Sophia Stewart died in 1852 where after Playfair built one of the most amazing memorials I have ever seen. The photograph below shows this and is in a line of tombs aptly named The Lord’s Row! His own memorial and the one to Lord Jeffrey are also worth a visit too. Francis Jeffrey qualified as a lawyer and was one of the co-founders of the influential magazine, the Edinburgh Review. He was editor, then became a politician and also the Lord Advocate.
His links to Burke and Hare are tenuous at best but it was he that designed the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh building where the surgeon Robert Knox worked and where he purchased the bodies.
He also was the architect behind the National Gallery of Scotland, the Old College at the University of Edinburgh and the Royal Scottish Academy along with what was termed the east or third New Town and many other Edinburgh neoclassical land marks. The old, steep steps that lead from the top of the Mound, down to the National Gallery are called the ‘Playfair Steps’ in his honour.
Born in London, his father was also an architect and shortly after his death he was sent to Edinburgh to be educated by his uncle John Playfair, usefully a famous mathematician. His alma mater was the University of Edinburgh and after graduating he joined the team of celebrated architect William Stark and eventually joined the Freemasons.
William Playfair died in Edinburgh in 1857, and is also buried in the Lord’s Row on the western edge where he designed monuments for others as shown above.
Since his death and completed in 2004 ‘The Playfair Project’ joined by tunnel the two separate buildings making up the National Galleries and then most recently the southern building has undergone an amazing £38m transformation, with a huge new subterranean section built into the Mound and exiting onto Princes Street gardens with stunning views over Waverley and the old Nor Loch that showcases the very best of Scottish art, with Landseer’s Monarch of the Glen holding court in its new resting place on a huge wall at the end the new building.
While walking around Dean Cemetery recently, located high above Dean Village, sited on the banks of the Water of Leith, I came across the grave of Edinburgh artist John Bellany, noted for his almost impressionist or expressionist, stylised portrait paintings of Scottish icons such as Billy Connolly and Sean Connery, created in the early 90s. Connolly’s portrait called ‘The Entertainer’ is currently not on display but the one of Connery is still exhibited in the National Portrait Gallery today. Once you have seen a Bellany image, you will instantly always know when you see one again.
On the subject of Connolly and Connery, aside from being famous Scottish thespians and having portraits painted by Bellany, at a BAFTA ceremony in 1999, Billy was due to present Sean with a life time achievement award but couldn’t make the event and so over a live TV link from the US said to all the guests present and Connery and his wife ‘You’ve done awfully well for a man with a speech defect’ and ended ‘congratulations baldy, I wish I had your money!’. Praise indeed. Connery died in 2020 and the whole of Scotland will be in mourning when Connolly meets his maker and would pay good money to hear what he says to him.
Bellany was born in Port Seaton in Edinburgh and much of his work has the sea as a main theme which often diverges into his own psyche or human form. Other well-known images merge human and animal forms, often painted in an overtly menacing style, However, his portraits of well-known people such as Connolly, Connery and Ian Botham are the most recognisable for me especially with regards to the colour palette used. His painting style calmed down when he was diagnosed with cancer later in life and he died in 2013 aged 71. When in Edinburgh, it’s well worth looking out for his unique, contemporary works.
Sean Connery’s ashes were scattered in St Andrews.
Below are the two paintings in question and my own photographs from the Edinburgh galleries when they were on show and exhibited to the public.
Beware the Weeping Angels
The Seafield cemetery in Edinburgh, located beside the now defunct Restalrig Railway, a cycle trail and footpath between Leith and the long sandy beach at Portobello is well worth a walk around. Some of the memorials are seemingly straight out of a series of Dr Who.
For lifelong fans like me, the ‘Weeping Angels’ were really scary, ghost like alien creatures in the form of an angel who were introduced in 2007 and that if you blinked, the angel would be able to very rapidly move much closer to you and the end game being that if they can reach out and touch you then you’re sent back in time to a life of purgatory. They are unable to move while being watched by anyone living, including oddly themselves and are turned to stone when an eye is glanced upon them and so the angel below is quite a good representation, especially on a cold, dark day! When stone like, they cannot be harmed.
The then writer and creator Steven Moffat reckons that they are the most popular and frightening foe of the Doctor in that any stone statue could be one, but he would say that wouldn’t he. For me the Daleks and Cybermen will never be bettered but I am over sixty now!
They do really resemble female stone statues in the form of winged angels with draped robes that you might find in a Victorian graveyard like Seafield. However, as they move in closer to you they show off vampire like teeth and clawed fingers and in some episode they even had ‘babies’ that resembled demonic cherubs that laughed and made rather loud footsteps!
Weeping Angels can’t look at each other nor in a mirror and so shield their eyes to avoid paralysis, which is where they get their name from as it looks like they’re weeping but have the ability to send you back in time to an age when you didn’t exist or will ever exist. The resulting forces from this is their life blood.
There are many more nuances but we’ll leave that there!
The Scottish Enlightenment, in a very brief nutshell!
An amalgamation of free minds, ideas and publications was centred in particular in Edinburgh and also over Scotland generally during the second half of the 18th century and for decades prior to and after that. It was a movement of ideas and the debate of those ideas and in philosophy, the two men most prominent were David Hume and Adam Smith.
Edinburgh was then described as hotbed of genius while Voltaire wrote in 1762 rather contentiously that ‘today it is from Scotland that we get rules of taste in all the arts, from epic poetry to gardening’.
David Hume, a leading light in the movement was a philosopher, historian and economist who was best known for his influential beliefs in ‘empiricism, philosophical skepticism and metaphysical naturalism’ which is a view which holds that there is nothing but natural elements, principles, and relations of the type studied by the natural sciences and denies the existence of a transcendent God. Philosophical skepticism is an important form of scepticism in that it rejects knowledge claims that seem certain from the perspective of common sense.
Empiricism is the theory that all knowledge is based on experience derived from the senses and created by those who doubted the possibility of acquiring any knowledge beyond that of the contents of directly felt experience. He believed that ethics were based on emotion and sentiment rather than one’s moral compass.
His mantra that making lives better by finding differentiation between morality, religion, ethics, and society was critical to his ideas but hugely controversial for the time. Hume held that passions rather than reason rule the human psyche saying that ‘Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions’.
His philosophy of religion, as with Hutton’s view on Geology included a rejection of miracles and the existence of a creator God, were especially controversial for their time and where being outspoken on such issues was sometimes dangerous and considered blasphemous, something we need to be careful not to repeat today.
His most famous line was that: ‘The life of man is of no greater importance to the universe than that of an oyster’.
Adam Smith was a social philosopher and a political economist while David Hume and Smith were very close friends.
Smith famously said that ‘Labour was the first price, the original purchase-money that was paid for all things. It was not by gold or by silver, but by labour, that all wealth of the world was originally purchased.’
He believed that wealth is created by hard work and self-interest. Smith’s suggestions that economies that are based on free markets, competition and capitalism are still the bedrock of economics and growth today.
As the self-styled father of economics, he wrote the book ‘Wealth of Nations’ and also suggested that ‘Goods can serve many other purposes besides purchasing money, but money can serve no other purpose besides purchasing goods. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from regard to their own interest’.
Hume died in 1776 and Smith in 1790
Hume is interred at the Old Calton Hill burial ground, just off Waterloo Place in a round, tower like tomb as shown above with a locked gate to keep out the grave robbers while Smith’s body lies in the Canongate Kirkyard close to Holyrood and he has a statue on the Royal Mile.
And finally, Sir Henry Raeburn Scotland’s finest painter…arguably
Raeburn was born Stockbridge, just north of the city centre of Edinburgh and is depending whom you talk to is arguably the best known of all Scottish painters and is buried in St Cuthbert’s churchyard, located at the west end of Princes Street and across the road from the Caledonian Hotel. His formal portraits are instantly recognisable, with legends such as Sir Walter Scott, part of his prolific portfolio, just pay a visit to the National Portrait Gallery on Queen Street to find out!
He actually commissioned and installed his monument and grave at St Cuthbert’s well before he died in 1823, hence including him in my story.
However, perhaps the most famous painting accredited to him and I say that advisedly, may well not be by him at all and is not really a recognised portrait either.
The Reverend Dr Robert Walker skating on Duddingston Loch or colloquially known as ‘The Skating Minister’ was acquired by the National Galleries of Scotland in 1949 for a song and is one of their most popular paintings both to view and as part of its merchandise offering and so they are not going to give up on its provenance despite many believing that Henri-Pierre Danloux, a French immigrant who was based in Scotland at the time, was the painter. Some say that Raeburn simply painted the face and not the majestic motions of the holy man on the ice.
In Michelle Sloan’s great book ‘The Edinburgh Skating Club’ she takes a ‘novel’ approach to the painting’s narrative where her main character Alison Cockburn, who was employed and friends with the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume whom we’ve met above, colludes with his sister, Katherine Hume to live as a man so as to become a member of the prestigious and men only club.
In a coincidental nod to the toxicity of gender reform politics in Scotland these days whereby it was stated that you could self-certify as a woman after a few months of simply deciding to be one, this makes for a remarkably contemporary novel but one full of local historic Edinburgh landmarks, characters and times past.
The background story is set in modern times and catalogues an art historian’s efforts to attribute the work to Danloux and ‘out’ the outlandish fact that Rev Walker might just have been a woman about to win a very big, life changing bet! It’s a great read and a good whodunnit.
Raeburn at the age of 28 moved to London where he met and was hugely inspired by portraitist Joshua Reynolds returning to Edinburgh in 1787 where he started to paint portraits of the Auld Reekie’s rich and famous and was hugely sought after and successful despite being largely self-taught.
He was knighted in 1822 just a year before he died and shortly thereafter was appointed His Majesty’s Limner for Scotland. A limner is an illuminator of manuscripts, or more generally, a painter of ornamental decoration.
Raeburn was especially well known in Scotland as the outstanding portrait painter of members of the Scottish Enlightenment and probably painted in excess of 225 acknowledged pieces.
When the Leith based shipping business, Henry Raeburn and Company, collapsed at the end of 1807, he was declared bankrupt and was left to paint portraits and act as a property developer to pay off creditors for the rest of his life.
His painting of Walter Scott in 1822 was one of Raeburn’s undoubted highlights, someone who also was left bankrupt by a series of poor business decisions and overspending. Later in life he chased warmer weather in Italy by way of a lift on a UK naval frigate but suffered a stroke on his way home, he died in 1832 at Abbotsford, where he is buried. The portrait shows Scott deep in thought at the height of his writing career.
Raeburn’s self-portrait was designed to project himself as the premier painter in the land especially to his peers down in London and painted this as his diploma picture for entry into London’s Royal Academy. He painted in York Place in a New Town house that had large north facing windows and special shutters to create the ultimate conditions for is work. He never made it back to London to paint and died in 1823 and is buried in his chosen resting place at St Cuthbert’s kirkyard at the very west end of Princes Street gardens.
I ain’t afraid of no ghosts — The Ghostbusters song
For me, I’m a great proponent of the new assisted dying law and hope that it becomes part of the statute soon, just as a back stop for those so ill, they can’t bear it any longer. I’ll have a ‘pure cremation’, whereby without any fuss, they take me away in a black bin bag, return me in an urn and I get chucked out into the Moray Firth!
If it was mandatory to have an epitaph I would go for Clement Freud’s idea when he said before he died…it will simply bear my name, and then the date of my death beneath the words ‘best before’.
I don’t believe in ghosts but I wouldn’t want to spend a night alone in Greyfriars, it is a cold, dark and scary place but if graveyards are your thing, the Necropolis of the North or the Auld Reekie is well worth a visit.
I prefer the Cullen Pet cemetery near my home in Moray where I find the messages of love for lost pets far more moving and relevant to me, however in the past stupid EU rules closed it down, but after Brexit, people can once again bury pets themselves and say whatever they like about them.
Go see!

Or what the world’s biggest arts festival taught Leith planner, Claire Wood, about how to be better at her job.
Every August, Edinburgh hosts the biggest arts festival in the world. This year’s Fringe boasted over 55,000 performances of over 3,500 shows. Interestingly, it featured more shows about ‘social issues’ than previous years.
As someone who works for an ad agency and so spends a good portion of her time thinking about social issues and how advertising can persuade people to change harmful habits, I was curious to explore whether you can do the same with theatre. After all, the shortest show I saw this year lasted less than eight minutes. And even eight minutes gives you a better crack at encouraging people to change than a 30 second ad.
Of course, the context is different. Usually (though the Royal Mile in the Fringe is an exception), you actively choose a piece of theatre where you might bump into advertising content. And you usually plump for a particular production because some aspect of it appeals — the creative team, the topic, the actors. Few people actively seek out advertising as a reflection of their world view. (Is last week’s Nike campaign an honourable exception? Discuss.)
But assuming both do their jobs right, whether advertiser or theatre maker, both are creating content that they hope their audience will want to discover. So can we learn anything from theatre makers about how best to persuade people to change their ways? I think so — as follows:
Sometimes, the reasons you might want to behave differently are obvious. Most people now accept that it’s good to wear seatbelts when you’re driving and it’s bad to smoke, for example. But often, in order to persuade people to consider change — or disrupting a pattern — it helps if they understand the context, or the reasons why change is good.
Closed Doors was a quick-witted feisty piece of theatre by Glasgow performance poet, Belle Jones in collaboration with Novasound. Following a Police evacuation of a Glasgow tenement, three women from very different backgrounds are forced to confront the assumptions they’ve made about each other. Topical in these times of terrorist threats, firebombs and foiled plots, Jones’ message — that we should judge less and talk to each other more — is beautifully delivered.
From one woman’s story to another. Earlier this year, the Scottish Government passed a bill that recognised that domestic abuse isn’t only physical; it can also be psychological. ‘Coercive control’ will soon be easier to prosecute though the law will rely on victims coming forward to seek help.
Never Vera Blue was a devastating study of a woman trapped in an abusive relationship. Developed in partnership with the Gaia Centre in Lambeth, the peculiar ways in which coercive control can be exercised were thoroughly explored and the protagonist found a way out. Easy to say but not so easy to do.
By showing an understanding of the peculiar individual misery of an abusive relationship — and then dramatising an escape, Futures Theatre hope to both raise awareness of the problem, of how insidious and invidious coercive control can be and to inspire more people to take action.
2. Showing can help — but sometimes you have to tell
The Half Moon Shania briefly touched on a topic close to our client Drinkaware’s heart: sexual harassment in the night time economy. The musical explored a female punk band’s attempts to hit the big time in an industry all too ready to take advantage of wannabes. Burnt Lemon Theatre had ample opportunity (and didn’t really take it) to land a message about how you could behave if you see someone being harassed on a night out — but then they were making a piece of theatre, not a self-help manual.
At the other end of the spectrum were a bunch of shows that had a very explicit call to action. Part of Death on the Fringe, both User Not Found and Sit With Us For A Moment And Remember took on the tricky topic of grief. At Dante Or Die’s User Not Found, the audience listened to most of the play through headphones but were asked to take them off for the final scene —emphasising the importance of human contact. And I don’t want to ruin the climactic moment of Lincoln Company’s Sit With Us… to be found on a park bench overlooking Edinburgh’s extinct volcano but it was a beautiful reminder of the importance of being there for people.
Both, by building empathy — or at least intrigue in the case of Sit With Us — left a more lingering impression than a poster might.
3. Advocacy is as much as we can hope for
Beyond actually getting people to do the thing you hope they’ll do (CPR! Joining the organ donor register!), urging them to talk about it with friends and family can also be helpful to raise awareness and start to shift attitudes. With organ donation, it’s vital as consent is everything.
Leo Burtin’s The Midnight Soup is intended to do exactly that. As well as having one of the Fringe’s smartest marketing strategies — a ticket for his show also includes your dinner.
Under the auspices of talking about his grandmother’s unexplained suicide, Burtin invites a small audience to help him make soup. As we chop, he tells us about his gran, using her sudden death as a prompt for his audience to discuss their own attitudes towards and preparations for their own end of life care.
The experience of preparing food together, Burtin explained afterwards, helps break down a typically British awkwardness and encourages conversation. The Fringe was a temporary stop off. He’s more usually found taking the show to community centres and care homes — his soup cooker is portable!
Interesting for us advertisers as our field and experiential activity is usually intended to do something similar. We often rely on visual eye candy to attract people to the stand — and then field staff to convey our message. Maybe we need to be thinking harder about how we involve our audiences in the debate.
4. Empathy is everything
Whether we’re trying to persuade people to do an icky bowel cancer test or to drink a little bit less alcohol, we need to show that we understand our audience. Telling without sympathy and / or empathy is only lecturing. And who ever has responded well to that?
And maybe that’s where theatre has the advantage. You’ve bought a ticket for a show — and thereby given permission to whoever it is to talk at you for the next fifty minutes. Where we’re trying to persuade people to take time out of their to do lists and pay attention to us for a frantic thirty second slot. Poor us.
But we could also learn that with enough energy, creativity and vitally, ability to listen, it’s easy (easier, anyway) to empathise with your audience. I’ll Have What She’s Having was a cracking insight into what it is to be young, female, trying your best to have it all but buckling under the pressures of needing to be seen to have a perfect life on social media. Grassmarket Projects’ Where It Hurts looked at the NHS in its seventieth year. A homage to its collective grace and tenacity and a yowl of frustration at escalating demand, it reminded us that lots of health issues can’t be set in plaster and left to heal.
Aside from being a stunning show — I’m eternally grateful to David Amers for telling me at least three times that it was the best thing he’d seen this Fringe — Electrolyte by Wildcard was a stunning study of mental ill-health and the power of friends to help you through. You can read all the books you like about the disorientation, discombobulation, isolation and fear that goes with mental health problems but this young company turned all of that into an hour and ten minutes of gripping, glorious story-telling. Wildcard deliberately set out to give the “unknown and disenfranchised” a voice, thereby empowering them to take action. And Electrolyte does just that, with literal bells on.
And maybe that’s why the Edinburgh Fringe is a little bit like crack cocaine for me. Three weeks, 3,500 shows in a city that’s barely built to cope and every time you step off the street into another dim cavern, you’re bumping up against someone else’s little slice of life in all its unapologetic, fierce, feisty glory. Stories worm their way into your mind and your heart in a way that a textbook will always struggle to do. It might make for an empathy overload. But it’s also a greedy planner’s dream.

When arriving in Edinburgh, Scotland, I had little to no expectations for this trip. With finals being so close to leaving, I didn’t feel I had the time to research these places. I thought the city was beautiful, as I’ve never seen anything like it before. The architecture was amazing, I have never seen so many Gothic buildings. My time here left me with so many beautiful photos. Something I didn’t expect to see here though, was little to no local people! I had no clue that most people who live here are not from the area.
After experiencing the beautiful city of Edinburgh, Scotland, I fully expected Dublin, Ireland, to be very similar. Instead, Dublin was so vivid when I arrived, the city felt more alive than Edinburgh. When comparing them, I would say Edinburgh is like a small tourist town. While Dublin has the tourist town feeling with all of the gift shops, there is so much more to it! I noticed just walking the streets of Dublin I saw so many restaurants and shops I wanted to go back to. The area we went to in Scotland felt almost too geared towards tourists, as a majority of the stores there had the exact same items.
In Dublin, I saw more attractions, retail stores, and restaurants in between…

Last week I was trundling down Leith Walk’s infamous cycle lane and realised that I was having a deeply unpleasant time.
It’s wasn’t the ongoing threat of HGV drivers mounting the kerb, or drivers blasting through STOP signs at the junctions, or having to swerve around the pedestrians squeezed into the cycle lane by the preposterously narrow pavements.
No. It was the dreadful surface quality. Despite a warning from Spokes, the cycling advocacy group, the entirety of this critical active travel route has been hand laid, meaning that while drivers enjoy a beautifully smooth surface on the carriageway, cyclists have to put up with buckarooing their way down the Walk.
This was something worth quantifying, in the hope that the same mistake won’t be made again. Deploying the in-built accelerometer on my phone, I set out to test the primary cycle corridors in the city. I used the busy North Meadow Walk (NMW) as my baseline; it has a good surface, with a few bumps and rough patches.
On NMW I recorded a low median figure— that is, the middle number in all the observations my phone made as I cycled along. I think this is the best way to measure the general condition of the surface as it is not as affected by the very large bumps that come with potholes and other aberrations.
The paths of the north Edinburgh path network, or NEPN, tend to be the smoothest in the city. The new city-centre-west-to-east-link (CCWEL) is also of good quality on this measure.
“Bumps” are how I describe the fluctuations in the surface that can make life miserable for cyclists. To capture the size and frequency of such bumps, I calculated the 95th percentile of recorded acceleration for each of my journeys in Edinburgh. That is, the value at which a particular bump will find itself in the top 5% of all bumps for that particular path.
The same sequence of paths appears, though this time CCWEL doesn’t perform quite as well.
These are the sort of thing that can throw you from the saddle, or knock your panniers off. The 0.999 quantile.
The most severe bumps are found on Leamington Walk, with the Innocent Railway Path also suffering from a particularly awful surface on this measure. CCWEL scores very well, while on-road cycle paths typically do worse.
I gave equal weighting to each of the three measures described above and found that the worst surface you can find in Edinburgh is on Leith Walk’s northbound cycle lane. No surprise.
This was followed by those on McDonald Road and the direct route between Kings Buildings and central campus of Edinburgh University. The worst paths tend to be those that encounter heavy vehicle traffic, or were constructed some time ago.
That makes the brand new cycle-only paths on Leith Walk, Picardy Place and outside Toppings particularly woeful.
I also cycled down the carriageway of Leith Walk and found that for all three of my measures, it’s significantly better than the adjacent cycle lanes.
The most severe bumps have been plotted on this interactive map.
I used a google pixel phone, quadlock phone mount and the Physics Toolbox app to measure acceleration as I cycled along, measuring linear acceleration and recording my position via GPS.
I used the square of acceleration in this analysis on the assumption that discomfort does not correlate 1:1 with acceleration.
My phone made roughly 50 observations per second; after data cleaning, I had nearly half a million observations to play with.
Caveat — my phone isn’t the best measurement tool in the world, and the statistics I have contrived aren’t perfect either. However, I assert that they will be consistent with the experience of most cyclists in Edinburgh.

I’ve been enjoying Simon Young and Chris Woodyard’s podcast Boggart and Banshee, which deals with all manner of fairy encounters, witchcraft, and supernatural accounts.
Their most recent episode covers the mysterious dolls found near Arthur’s Seat in Edinburgh in June 1836. Local boys found a crevice on the hill containing seventeen dolls, a series of male wooden figures about 3–4 inches, clothed in various fabrics and interred in tiny pine coffins. Based upon the amount of decomposition, the dolls had been placed relatively recently. Eight of these dolls have survived until today at the National Museum of Scotland, which has put together an informative page on these finds with all manner of videos and photos of the dolls.
Simon and Chris advance the view that these dolls are used in the practice of malefic magic. Based upon the different fabrics used, they believe that these dolls represent particular victims selected by a local cunning person, wrapped in pieces of stolen clothing and placed in coffins to cause death.
I’m somewhat up in the air on this. Certainly, there is a great deal of local variation and interpretations of many different magical techniques, so depositing images in this manner is not necessarily out of the realm of practice. Yet this does leave several questions open.
One of the most common magical experiments recorded in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was the creation of two wax images to recover goods lost through theft. Calling upon angels to assist, the magician was told to put the wax close enough to the fire to be heated… but not too close, lest it cause injury. This technique was still known in Britain in the 1850s, as it appears in the magical notebook of the Liverpool cunning man William Dawson Bellhouse. So our hypothetical Edinburgh cunning person is likely to have known for a much less involved method to cause death through image magic.
This is by no means definitive, of course — a magician might not have heard of this technique, or lacked access to wax for some reason, or wanted to cause a long lingering death (see below), or any number of other possibilities.
Another question is the method of deposition. The most likely place to deposit malefic magic directed against a person is on their property — either in secret, so as to work its sorcery through proximity as long as possible, or openly, as a warning to the person. There are other models, of course. Yet I have trouble understand why a cunning person would use a cavern atop a high hill near a major urban center, returning to the site seventeen times. Why not bury each coffin individually elsewhere, in the manner suggested here? Why risk discovery of the assemblage by repeated visits?
What would be an alternative explanation, then? I think previous examiners have missed the most obvious clue — and those of you who have been following my roleplaying accounts know what it is.
We have a set of entirely male figures — according to some, made to appear as soldiers — hidden in a cave on a major geographic feature named after King Arthur. Could it be that these dolls are a tribute in honor of the Once and Future King, who is often credited with resting with his knights in caverns across Britain until he comes forth again to save the land?
Admittedly, I’d feel better about this theory if there was a doll discovered that had a crown. But some of the dolls were destroyed, and given that they were in various degrees of decomposition, it’s likely any hypothetical “Arthur” doll would have been the first added and in the worst shape of all.
I’d be interested to hear what you think. Is this plausible? Am I missing something?

Today I’m going to take you on a walking tour through old Edinburgh. This piece was originally written as a script for an armchair audio tour. It incorporates stories about historical figures like Mary, Queen of Scots, the body snatchers Burke and Hare, William Wallace and Robert the Bruce as well as tales of ghosts and witches, and a sprinkling of architecture. It is intended to be read out loud and listened to on a rainy afternoon by a roaring fire with a glass of single malt whisky to hand. Slàinte mhath!
Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland, is my hometown. It regularly makes the top ten lists of best places to live in the world and best cities to visit. In summer, because Edinburgh is so far north, you can enjoy about 18 hours of daylight. The Old Town is a World Heritage Site and stretches along a ridge from Castle Rock down to the Palace of Holyroodhouse.
Edinburgh is built on seven hills which provide a dramatic backdrop to the city’s skyline. These hills include Arthur’s Seat, an ancient volcano that provides panoramic views of the city and beyond, and Calton Hill, home to some of Edinburgh’s most iconic monuments.
Now, close your eyes, and take a deep breath. The weather today is cool, with a breeze that carries the fresh salty air from the nearby North Sea. Feel the damp, misty air on your face. Exhale and relax.

There is this idea that if you know an area, a city, you can look up its main street and see years of history having already been made. The geography of it literally recalls history just in looking. There’s where this happened, here’s where that happened. . .
Take a look down Edinburgh Scotland’s Royal Mile, and you surely see down a millenium. Starting at the west end, there’s Edinburgh Castle, site of more than a few siege takings. In it was born a king, and in it one died, as well. The king born was King James of Scotland, son of Mary Queen of Scots. He was later asked to be the king of England as well. His mom had his dad killed, it is rumored, in the castle. At best, the whole thing was a shady ordeal. Mary, Queen of Scots was not born in it, but she ruled from it for a number of years.
Maybe you think of a queen as someone in her 40’s or 50’s, but no, Mary was a maiden of some 20 something years when she returned to Scotland from France to rule the people of Scotland. But she is another story.
Come out from the castle to the promenade where the Tattoo is held. This tattoo is a military celebration of sorts, held every year during the Edinburgh International Festival in August. At this tattoo several different military regiments from all over Scotland come to show off their skills, uniforms and Scottish pride for all the world to see, and it is quite a show. It is best to take in the later of the two evening events, as the fireworks are more spectacular later on. In August, it is broad daylight at 9:30 pm! So, the good watching is around 11:30.
The Royal Mile is not the official name of the street, it is more an honorary title given to it. This is actually more than a mile, from Edinburgh Castle to Holyrood Palace, at the east end. The Royal Mile actually has 4 street names given to it. The street numbering system has them running out of numbers in short order, so they just change the street name every few blocks, and that takes care of it. Two of those names were done away with, and one assigned to that portion.
Coming from the promenade is Johnston Terrace, which extends east to Bank Street. At this corner is a speakeasy known as Deacon Brodie’s Tavern. Deacon Brodie was a highly respected cabinetmaker; well at least during the day. At night, it was a different story. He was known to be a robber in the night hours. One time he was caught in the coffers of the national treasury. He escaped then and fled the country. He then wrote a note to someone he knew in Edinburgh, from what he thought was a secure location. Authorities were able to determine this so-called secure location, went after him, placed him under arrest, brought him back to Scotland, and hung him on gallows he had himself built for someone else. It was his double life that inspired the Robert Louis Stevenson epic novel, “Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde”.
At Bank Street, the mile becomes High Street, a name which stays with it for most of its length. Walk half a block east on High Street, cross the street, and you see one landmark, the Heart of the Lothian, built into the brickwork just a few feet out the door of St. Giles Cathedral. Scotland is divided into several regions, and Edinburgh is in the center of the Lothian Region. So, the Heart of the Lothian is dead center of this region. In much earlier days, there was a prison on this site.
As I said, this Heart of the Lothian is but a few feet away from the head worship center of the Church of Scotland, St. Giles Cathedral. The Presbyterian Church worldwide has its origins here. What we call the Presbyterian Church, in Europe, is called the Church of Scotland. Its most famous preacher and head was John Knox, a Scot himself, born in Gifford. Knox was himself a disciple of John Calvin of Germany, but when he took his own stand in Scotland it was at St. Giles, and he re-established the church there. Knox was in the pulpit while Mary was on the throne just up the street, and he was heard to speak of the need for dethroning for her deeds. To re-establish St. Giles as such took evicting some adherents of the Church of England. They left and started Old St. Paul’s Episcopal Church.
The Royal Mile runs downhill, west to east, and there are some cross streets, but to facilitate passage down the hill to the north, and indirect access to patrons on the Mile, stepped passageways called closes where built here and there between buildings. It is in these closes that other establishments were located. There are many closes up and down the Mile, and each has its own history.
Step out the east door of St. Giles, take but a few steps, and you arrive at a round structure with a gabled roof known as the Mercat Cross. This was an ancient assembly point for people of the town. They assembled there to hear governmental decrees, proclamations, and to witness public hangings.
One website describes it thus: “the old center of town- marketplace, news-stand, pulpit and gallows . . . it was a real one stop shop!”
The present Mercat Cross does not stand where the original did, but that location is marked by a cross laid into the sidewalk. It was the center of the old Edinburgh.
Going a block or so east on the mile, one arrives at Tron Kirk. Kirk is Scottish for church. (Talk about the US and the UK- two countries separated by a common language!) Now before Knox arrived at St. Giles, the Church of England had pretty well dispatched the Church of Scotland out of the place. They went a block east and built the Tron Kirk.
Actually, it was called “The Bishop’s War, where the king tried to introduce Episcopal structure into the Church of Scotland. He actually took over St. Giles and made it the seat of the Bishop of the Church of England.
So, the Church of Scotland people, refusing this intrusion, went and built the Tron Kirk. The building itself is no longer a church, but its physical structure remains as a visitor center.
Cross the street again, and head east from North Street, walking until you get to a large building called Carrubbers Christian Center. Carrubbers was founded back in the 19th Century in the Carrubbers Close, as a mission. Dwight L. Moody came and brought his chief musician Ira Sankey, and together they raised enough money to build this large 4 story evangelistic center. Originally built with a two-story worship center, the lower floor was converted to other uses in recent years. The center has been a beacon of hope to Edinburgh since its inception and remains so today. It has a library, a meeting hall, and dorm rooms on the top floor for university students as well as visiting clergy.
Go further east, on that side of the street, and the building that juts out and establishes a new position for the fronting buildings is the home of the preacher from the cathedral up the street, John Knox. Knox lived here during his years when he pastored at St. Giles Cathedral. His years pastoring St. Giles were also his last. He died in this house. I will warn you, though, that the people who marked his life with this museum were not terribly kind to his message of the Gospel or his dealings.
Going further down the street one more block, the Royal Mile changes its name to Canongate, a city gate from early days of the town. On Canon Gate, one walks the rest of the mile to Holyrood Palace, the annual accommodations for the Queen of England in June. The royal family also spends a month in the north of Scotland, at Balmoral Castle.
To look up the Royal Mile is to look up into history, and it always reminds you. A sea mist, called a haar, can roll in though, and you won’t see past a block, they are so thick. But you’ll never forget where you’ve been!

Last time I lived in Edinburgh it was 1993. I moved there with a bunch of friends after university. As you might expect from a group of people who’d spent more time in the pub than in the lecture theatre, none of us had managed to get a proper graduate job.
It was the middle of a recession so we figured we’d go hang out in Edinburgh, continue the party lifestyle, do some temp work and maybe even find a job to make our parents proud.
At that time no one had heard of She Who Must Not Be Named, although funnily enough 1993 was the year that she moved to Edinburgh. She’d already sketched the outline for the Harry Potter books but in 1993 J.K. Rowling began writing in cafes such as Nicolson’s (now Spoon) and no doubt was influenced by the city’s history and architecture.
Our Edinburgh at that time revolved around nights out at indie and alternative clubs like the Mission in Victoria Street, Evol or FBI in the Cowgate, various pubs in the Grassmarket and around the University, live music at the Preservation Hall or the Ensign Ewart and visits to the many art galleries and museums (all of which were free).
We’d walk all over the city and I truly loved it. But all good things come to an end, and…

Nobody cares about the fact I’m going to Edinburgh Fringe and neither should they. I’m a comedian going on a jolly for a couple of weeks in a great city with loads of my pals and trying to make people laugh. Yes it’ll probably bankrupt me and I’ve done everything in my power to not lose money hand over fist but even so, nobody is forcing me, it’s fucking great at it’s core (once we overthrow the Tories up there charging thousands for August rents). I could use this piece to get extremely angry about class and how it’s easy to do it if you’re secretly loaded, but we all know that, so allow me to drivel on for 800 words (681 from here on in, OK and that used up five, we’re nearly there) and hopefully encourage you to tweet the link to this piece with one of the following quotes above the link so people think I’ve made some sort of life-changing point;
My show is about…..WOMEN. Does that make you uncomfortable?! Probably not. You might even know one. It came from working in women’s media and being told every day what to be angry at, what to be turned on by, what to be repulsed by, who to be angry at and why you must always, every single day, be told how to ask for a pay rise. There’s an entire industry dedicated to books about work. Can you believe it? Titles like ‘How To Get What You Want At Work And Shag Your Colleague Respectfully’ and ‘How To Boss Bitch Your Way Into Millions Of Pounds And Shit On Everyone You Know.’ People buy them! Where is the book that says ‘Here’s How To Never Fill In A TimeSheet Ever Again’ — I would buy that. Read books about shagging and love and mad stuff! Not the thing you do all day! I digress.
My show is about how sometimes I’m not angry at the right things and I do stupid shit and that true equality is ripping the piss out of men and women. The day Mother’s Day cards contain a joke is the day Gloria Steinem can have a quick fag break to relax before cracking on with the serious stuff.
And of course, there are properly awful things going on for women at the moment, but you all know about that too. I’m just inviting you to come and laugh at me for 45 minutes in the back of a pub and maybe sling me a tenner at the end for my efforts. (If you don’t, you’re sexist) A lot of Edinburgh shows are about something moving, poignant, tragic or dark, I’m here to tell you that my parents are both alive, sadly were very supportive of me, and never ask me if I’m going to get married. They fed me almost exclusively Findus Crispy Pancakes and Spaghetti Hoops for about 12 years as well so in many ways, they’re legends. I’ve got nice pals, big dark roots that I can’t afford to dye, and my life has mostly been pretty good, despite my job on the ASDA checkout and Morrisons chicken counter, so you can see my issue. In many ways, making a show out of almost exclusively stupid sexual decisions is actually harder. No pun intended. Well it is now, I wrote it and then realised.
Please come and see Woman In Progress at Southsider, 6th — 17th August, at 5.45pm. You won’t regret it, straight away at least. It’s with PBH Free Fringe, so just pay what you want at the end!
Follow me on Instagram if you liked this [at]alexandrahaddow
Thanks and hopefully see you there!

As a frequent visitor to Edinburgh, I’ve had the opportunity to explore some of the city’s best-kept secrets. While it’s easy to get caught up in the popular tourist attractions, there’s so much more to this beautiful city that often goes unnoticed. Here’s my personal guide to some of Edinburgh’s best hidden gems.
St. Bernard’s Well — Tucked away in the Dean Village, this hidden gem is a peaceful haven away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The well was built in the late 18th century and has a unique design that is said to be based on the Temple of Vesta in Italy. The tranquil setting and stunning architecture make it the perfect spot for a quiet moment of reflection.
The Writers’ Museum — While many visitors flock to the Edinburgh Castle or the National Museum of Scotland, the Writers’ Museum is often overlooked. This hidden gem celebrates the lives and works of three of Scotland’s most famous writers: Robert Burns, Sir Walter Scott, and Robert Louis Stevenson. The museum is located in a 17th-century building just off the Royal Mile and is filled with fascinating artifacts and exhibits.
The Royal Botanic Garden — While not exactly a hidden gem, the Royal Botanic Garden is often overshadowed by other popular attractions in Edinburgh. The garden boasts a vast collection of plant species from around the world, as well as stunning views of the city. It’s the perfect place for a leisurely afternoon stroll or a peaceful picnic.
Stockbridge — This charming neighborhood is just a short walk from the city center, yet it feels like a world away. With its eclectic mix of independent shops, cafes, and restaurants, Stockbridge is a great place to explore and soak up the local culture. Don’t miss the weekly farmers’ market, which is brimming with fresh, locally sourced produce.
The Sheep Heid Inn — Tucked away in the charming village of Duddingston, this historic pub is said to be the oldest in Scotland. The pub’s unique attraction is its skittle alley, a game similar to bowling that’s fun for all ages. It’s a great spot for a pint and a game of skittles with friends.
And now for a joke related to this post — Why did the writer bring a map to the Royal Botanic Garden? To find the roots of all the hidden gems! Okay, maybe it’s not the best joke, but I hope it made you smile.
As a frequent visitor to Edinburgh, I can say that these hidden gems are some of my favorite places in the city. Whether you’re a first-time visitor or a seasoned traveler, I hope this guide inspires you to explore all that Edinburgh has to offer.

I stepped foot in Edinburgh many decades ago and immediately fell in love with the place. That first sight of the city will never leave me, and I still adore the way it holds its head high. It was the strongest against Brexit, it has more graduates as a percentage than virtually any other place on the planet, and it hosts world-class innovation and research. While its infrastructure is never at a scale that the mighty London can achieve in terms of innovation, it is livable, walkable, and a fairly safe place to live.
And, so, I just loved this quote [here]:
The mix of old and new, tradition and innovation, sums up my city. Around its ancient building exists world-leading research and innovation, and, like Glasgow, it is focused on technology and scientific advancements. The city nurtured three of our cybersecurity spin-outs, and I believe we could not have succeeded as well as they did without the help of the city — in supporting investment, collaborations, and most of all, attracting the talent needed to build high-impact companies. While Brexit was a major spanner in the works, the city has managed to showcase its economic resilience — more to do with its people and businesses than by politicians — and continues to build its place on an international stage.
For students, it’s a great place to come and study and is in the Top 10 cities of the world for this. In the QS World guide, the rankings for the best city to study are [here]:
For a relatively small city, a Top 10 finish is amazing. But, it’s not a big city, and that’s a good thing! Many people can live and work within an area that allows you to walk to work, or, at least, get a bus. In fact, Edinburgh buses are great. While we have a new tram, most Edinburgh people still use the bus to get around. You are typically just 30 minutes away from anywhere in Edinburgh.
And, so, if you like hills — Edinburgh has seven of these, and an extinct volcano to walk around. For beaches, you choose whatever style you like, and for parks, you’ll find one at every turn. But, the best thing, is that it is a truly enterprising and innovative city, that prides itself on its love of education and scientific advancement.
Cities are key to our future. They are economic drivers and places to innovation. Care for your city, and let it live.

This week in Edinburgh, GDS hosted its first in-person Design System Day conference. Here are a few of my highlights from the day.
Dynamic Earth felt like a strangely appropriate place to host Design System Day 2023: the giant globe hanging above our heads was a fitting metaphor for the planetary consequences of national scale design decisions.
Samantha Ernstzen and Jennifer l’Anson reflected on the process of creating the Scottish Government Digital Design System.
Their purpose was refreshingly succinct:
“to enable teams within the Scottish public sector to design and build digital products that are accessible, usable and consistent for people accessing public services in Scotland.”
Adoption is always a challenge. Even with a strong design system, people can still put together bad forms with good components! We’ve all seen examples of digitised forms recreating the paper original, mirroring the many-boxes-per-page approach of the pre-digital era.
The challenge isn’t just educating government departments in how best to use a design system, it’s also getting external suppliers to embrace it.
Mandating use of an existing design system isn’t enough: we need to support agencies and consultancies in adopting it and implementing it successfully!
Ciandelle, Calvin and Steve gave a quickfire summary of all the updates GOV.UK have been making, including improving accessibility.
One newly released development is the Exit this page feature. It allows a user to quickly close down a page if they are in danger: particularly useful for those suffering domestic abuse. It may look like just a small button, but took about five years of work to research and implement!
Massive news: designers were delighted to hear that a new crown’s gonna drop — watch this space for a slightly modified GOV.UK logo coming soon!
Katrina Birch facilitated a fantastic panel on trauma-informed research and design.
70% of people have experienced trauma, and 1 in 10 will suffer from PTSD at some point in their life. We should be aware of trauma and the risk of vicarious trauma when conducting user research around difficult topics. Shout out to Chayn, getting an honourable mention for their excellent resources on the topic.
Tash Willcocks closed out the day with her thoughts on the elephant in the room: teams.
Design systems are enablers of scale and consistency, but developing and establishing them requires conditions of high trust and psychological safety.
In short, to save the parrots, we must use the shallot and master the elephant (I promise it made sense, you had to be there).
Thanks so much to all the volunteers and GDS-ers that made Design System Day 2023 possible: it was a glorious gathering of passionate practitioners!
A final quote from the day, sums up nicely the role of design in most organisations:
“We’re not here just to build components and patterns. We make impact through multiplier effects.”
Looking forward to next year!

HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT
I recall standing outside the Pleasance Dome flyering my show a few years ago.
I was exhausted and knew I had to fill a big room and faced losing cash so I was anxious and desperate to make sure people came to see me.
I had rented a good flat and paid for amazing posters and had what I believed to be a fabulous show.
Then I spotted a couple of people who had seen me at a showcase show and had taken my flyer after the gig as they liked my stuff. I brightened up and as I approached them I watched a comedy promoter hand them two free tickets to his latest newly signed act’s show.
They took them. They were FREE.
He had a HUGE wad of free tickets and was giving them to people all around the Pleasance Dome. I lost the sale. I watched and my heart sank as people didn’t give a fuck how funny I had been at the 1pm showcase show.
They had free tickets and free is everything in this current climate.
No doubt the fringe this year yet again will release the BEST EVER SALES AT THE FRINGE and sit back as they manipulate the figures and the PR will spin it good.
I know that the figures aren’t always true, for ONE BIG SELL OUT there are hundreds of smaller shows underwriting them in the big venues and those comics were doing it on their own cash in the hope of a crowd.
Performers go home skint, owing money and are artistically broken.
I have no issue with the big paid venues, I just see issues that the Free Festival can resolve.
On the last weekend of the last few fringe’s I watched BIG NAMED ACTS give away TWO for ONES on the last Thursday and Friday. That’s not a great financial sign and was I aggressively flyered for a comic whose face graces the BILLBOARDS to buy tickets for his ‘EXTRA SOLD OUT SHOW’ which is a weird oxymoron. It can’t be sold out and still have tickets to sell.
Also audience members must be horrified to find out they had paid full price for tickets and realised half the audience were in for free or HALF PRICE and that’s an insult to early bird ticket buyers.
People were so scared of losing face.
This year am back at The Counting House Ballroom as is my daughter comedian Ashley Storrie.
Last year both me and Ashley had a BUMPER run and played to full rooms every day. I had people sitting on the floor of my venue and Ashley had people standing in her room and outside for a chance to get in.
They put cash in the buckets. We left with a profit, a very good profit if truth be told. We also told the crowds if they donated silver and bronze coins we gave that to the homeless and later on we dished it out fairly round the city’s street collectors.
I encouraged other comics and acts to get up and pitch their shows to my big comedy loving full capacity crowd. I tweeted about other comics gigs and helped flyer for other shows. It felt like THE FRINGE.
The people who came to the shows were brilliant.
Dealing with hard cash was weird. I felt like a mid price day time sex worker, I haven’t had that much money in my bag in years. We generally don’t carry much cash as a society now. It reminded me of when I owned a pub and used to count the takings.
People no longer see the Free Festival shows as ‘well it’s free it must be shit’ and I don’t believe they ever did. This is a nice neat rumour and label put on it by the same people who resent the free shows but have no issue giving out free tickets at a paid venue for a show that can’t shift a ticket.
When I did all the big “paid” venues I made thousands of pounds but the financial cut left to me was woeful and I STILL made a profit am one of the few who did. My accountant was stunned by the business model that means you pay for seats in advance and a venue is guaranteed their cash and cut NO MATTER WHAT before you step foot in the capital. The artist takes all the risk. Every seat you dont sell the venue has already been paid for that, the loss is not theirs….it’s YOURS.
Think of it this way…
Imagine you hired a bus with twenty seats, you paid the company for twenty seats….if you only sold 6 of those seats, you lose money.
Now think of that in a 200 seater venue at the fringe where the market is SATURATED with comics giving away FREE SEATS AND TWO FOR ONE SEATS every single day. Now you see my point.
Tax was a well worn phrase when talking about the free venues.
“Yes, but do the free festival comics declare their takings?” one comedy promoter asked me.
I don’t think anybody has the right to assume anyone is fucking their taxes based on a dislike of their business model. If you have an issue with people not paying their due tax please go check some Tory peers before you nitpick at comics you avaricious cunts. While you are at it please make sure the big venues who boast “BEST YEAR EVER” are not putting their profits into an offshore account to avoid taxes in UK.
I pay my tax.
I love the fringe and the past few years doing free fringe shows means I have loved it more. It felt like the old days. It felt good and it felt fair.
I encouraged the people who were skint and living under austerity to come see our shows for free. I also encouraged people who saw the show to take money OUT OF THE BUCKET if they needed some cash.
some tips for acts putting on a FREE SHOW….
Me and My daughter Ashley Storrie are back at the Counting House this year.

Today marked the conclusion of our journey. We had been traveling for nine days and were eager to get home. It had been a while since we had unwinded and slept in our bed at home.
Another reason was my spouse wasn’t feeling well. Our outing in Stonehaven yesterday gave him the chills. We were lucky he did not become ill while traveling, as it would have derailed our entire itinerary.
However, on our final day in Edinburgh, we had one more day of exploring before ending our trip.
After leaving our cabin, we headed towards Dundee on the Tay estuary. Around 11 am, we reached the magnificent city of Dundee. Everything appeared wonderful, and the weather was ideal.
Fun Fact: In 2014, Dundee was recognized by the United Nations as the UK’s first-ever UNESCO City of Design.
We went to a cafe and had a tuna sandwich with coffee. We strolled beside the Tay River. The River Tay is the longest river in Scotland and the seventh-longest in Great Britain.

In the heart of Scotland lies a city steeped in history, culture, and academia: Edinburgh. Home to one of the world’s most prestigious universities, the University of Edinburgh, the city attracts students from all corners of the globe. Among the many challenges that come with starting a new chapter in a different city, finding the perfect accommodation stands as a pivotal moment in a student’s life.
Picture this: a vibrant young student, full of ambition and excitement, stepping foot into the historic cobblestone streets of Edinburgh. For many, this marks the beginning of an incredible journey towards higher education and personal growth. But behind this exciting new chapter lies a quest for the perfect place to call home during these formative years.
For Jamie, a student hailing from London, the search for student accommodation Edinburgh was both thrilling and daunting. Having been accepted into the University of Edinburgh’s prestigious business program, Jamie found himself faced with the task of finding accommodation that suited not only his budget but also his need for a conducive environment for studying.
The quest began online, scrolling through countless listings and options. From shared flats to purpose-built student accommodations, the choices seemed endless. Each listing had its unique charm, promising proximity to the university, modern facilities, and a vibrant community of fellow students.
After much deliberation, Jamie narrowed down his options to a few promising prospects. He decided to visit Edinburgh in person, a decision that would prove invaluable in his search. Stepping into the city, he was greeted by its rich history and the blend of old-world charm with a bustling modernity — a juxtaposition that captured his heart instantly.
His first visit was to a student housing complex located conveniently close to the university. As he walked through the doors, he was met with a lively atmosphere — students chatting in the common areas, engaging in study groups, and overall, a sense of community that was palpable. The rooms were modern, compact yet cozy, equipped with all the essentials a student could need. The allure of being surrounded by like-minded peers was tempting.
However, Jamie wanted to explore other options before making a decision. He ventured into the heart of the city, where charming old buildings were converted into student flats. The historic ambiance was undeniable, but the rooms were often smaller and lacked some of the modern amenities he had seen in the purpose-built accommodations.
Then came the visit to a shared flat — a common choice among students looking for a more independent living experience. The prospect of living with a few roommates excited Jamie. The flat was spacious, with each room uniquely decorated, reflecting the personalities of its occupants. The idea of creating a home away from home with fellow students felt appealing, fostering a sense of camaraderie.
After careful consideration and weighing the pros and cons of each option, Jamie ultimately chose to reside in the purpose-built student accommodation. Its proximity to the university, modern amenities, and the vibrant community it offered aligned perfectly with his aspirations for his university life.
Settling into his new accommodation, Jamie found himself surrounded by a diverse group of students — each with their own stories, cultures, and ambitions. The communal spaces became a hub for socializing, studying, and forging lifelong friendships.
Living in student accommodation in Edinburgh wasn’t just about having a place to stay; it was an integral part of Jamie’s university experience. It became the backdrop for late-night study sessions, impromptu gatherings, and the formation of lasting bonds.
As Jamie delved deeper into his studies, he realized that the choice of accommodation had a profound impact on his overall university journey. The convenience, the sense of community, and the support from fellow students made navigating the challenges of university life more manageable.
Looking back, Jamie reminisces about the thrill of finding the perfect place to live in Edinburgh. It wasn’t just a roof over his head; it was the cornerstone of his university adventure — a place where he didn’t just reside but truly belonged.
For any student venturing into the vibrant city of Edinburgh, the quest for accommodation may seem like a daunting task, but it’s a journey filled with choices that shape an unforgettable university experience — a journey much like Jamie’s, filled with exploration, decisions, and ultimately, a place to call home.

Glasgow, Edinburgh’s younger and cheekier brother. A winter’s visit to this exciting city filled me with a lot of excitement. The journey began with a night bus from London Victoria to Buchanan Street Station, north of the English/ Scottish border. As soon as I arrived on the bus, I was surrounded by the echoes of the thick Glaswegian accent. Coupled with that were men chewing away on Sainsbury’s 5 packs of donuts and mothers and daughters arguing about who had the window seat. Presumably the views from the Megabus up the M40 and M6 overnight weren’t to be missed. On arrival at 7am into Glasgow, it was still dark. I was due to visit one of my oldest friends, Greg Bond, however I would first be met by his namesake, Greggs, who provided me with a coffee and Pan au Chocolat to welcome me to Scotland. The sun only lights up the city 30 minutes after it would in London, which is also known for its excellent weather. I wandered through the chartered streets of the city where I was surprised by an incredible orange and yellow sunset that crept over the Lanarkshire hills and the schemes that fill Glasgow’s skyline.
Arching past the Glasgow Necropolis (the cemetery) and the Tennents beer factory, I wandered to the East End of the city to meet Greg and his girlfriend, Jess. We soon headed to Tibo Bistro, a local Scottish brunch eatery where I tried my first full Scottish breakfast. This included, black pudding and haggis, both of which I hadn’t tried for a very long time but were incredibly tasty. Glasgow has an excellent selection of restaurants, notably to add, the Ubiquitous Chip, which I previously visited in 2016 on my first visit to this city (I would highly recommend both of these places). The rest of the day would be spent hopping around bars and watching football, the hoops (Celtic) no less were playing at home and some of the bars refused to show the premier league but rather would show the Scottish games. It’s understandable, really. You got a real sense of how strong the local identity is in Glasgow. Not only from the accent and their pride towards either Rangers or Celtic Football Clubs but also from their use of language. Words you would never use in the South of England, or internationally in this language. ‘Spu*k’, ‘C*nt’ and ‘Sh*te’ are all very much on the table and part of the local tongue. Jess mentioned this is just part of the Glasgwegian identity and people of all ages, with the exception of really formal events or in the company of elderly family, would people liberallly use these words. For example, Jess said ‘I don’t want to sp*nk all my money away travelling’. The sense of irony was real for me here.
We stopped for a bite to eat at a chicken burger joint, complemented naturally by a pint of Tennents, of course. Here, we met Greg’s friends Gus, with whom he shared his birthday event with that evening and Zac, who I’d met many moons ago while he and Greg were at university here. We then headed to a bar called the rum shack, where we met more of their friends, most of whom were from Greg and Gus’ former and current hockey clubs. Being in Glasgow and with a lot of sporty, sociable folks, this made for quite a drink heavy evening. We played a game called ‘ou l’est le poulet’, which literally translates from French as ‘where is the chicken?’. Here, Gus and Greg identified themselves as the ‘chickens’ and they organised a kitty of money for drinks for them and whoever could find them throughout the night. They selected 15–20 bars within a few miles radius of the rum shack and they said the first to meet us at the one they were at will be able to benefit from the complimentary drinks from the budget. The first there would receive a Champagne reception. Luckily, I was with two local Glaswegian blokes who knew Greg, Gus and the city very well so we made it to this grand reception after stopping at only 2 other pubs on the way to the Ivory hotel. The Ivory was an eyesore geographically away from the collection of other proposed pubs. We thought we’d go and check it just to be sure, but we didn’t genuinely believe that they’d actually be there. As the rest of the groups arrived, we then settled into the drinks from the kitty as well as some tasty nachos. The night continued from the Ivory hotel to another bar in town. After 12 hours on the beers on the back of a night bus, I decided to call it an evening before my flight home in the morning back to London town. All in all, I’d highly recommend this city for food, drinking and a good time watching sport. But keep an eye and an ear open for the Glaswegian tongue.

When Henry was a wee one I read to him every night. He’d pick two or three picture books from his bookshelf, and we’d cuddle in the couch or his bed, and read together. As a train fanatic he had quite a few train books, and Slow Train from Oxmox was one of his favorites.
The little book was about just that, a slow train goes through the country and encounters animals and assorted obstacles. It’s whimsical and cheerful, perfect for a night time story.
When I spent a little over two weeks in London in April, one of my goals was to venture outside the city and explore other parts of UK. I picked Edinburgh for the second weekend. For years Edinburgh Yarn Festival was one of the go-to fiber events in Europe, and I’m still kicking myself for not making it in 2019, because no one knew that was going to be the last one. Regardless, Edinburgh the city still held my intense interest and I decided that was my destination for the weekend.
The train from Kings Cross Station in London to Edinburgh is a little over five hours on LNER line (LNER stands for London North Eastern Railway and is pronounced with the letters spelled out, not “liner” as I first thought), and the route goes along the east side of England, at some point right by the beach. The views are stunning. — Side note, after the trip I rewatched Harry Potter movies. I can’t tell you how thrilling it was to see the LNER trains in the background every time they were in Kings Cross Station.
I took off from London on Friday morning, spent Friday evening to Sunday morning in Edinburgh. I booked the return trip to leave around 1:30pm, so I’d have lunch in Edinburgh and be back in London for dinner. The train ride is very comfortable with free wifi and electric outlets, so I could listen to my audiobook while knitting, or napping. I had a window seat facing forward as I picked, and most of the time the seat next to me was empty.
About an hour outside of London, suddenly there was loud metal screeching and the train lurched forward, eventually came to a stop, but not before there was a big thump, hitting something big. Soon the conductor’s voice came through the scratchy speaker, yes, there was a deer on the track and the train hit it; yes, the engineers would have to check out the damage, and no, no one could get off the train. Of course they would keep the passengers updated. But what about Bambi??
So we wait. Every ten minutes or so the conductor came on the speaker, still checking the damage, getting help from the next station, possibly moving everyone to another train. Just how big was Bambi? Maybe Bambi was a big boy with big horns, big enough to cause the train to lose air pressure. The next, closest, station was fifteen minutes away, and from the conductor’s voice, the engineers wondered aloud if the train would be able to go that far with the damage, or have another train fetch all the passengers. Neither option seem comforting when you are in the middle of the beautiful but remote English countryside. I looked on Google Map and the only thing nearby was a tiny nursery school. I wondered where the kids came from.
More than an hour after the thump, a train materialized itself on the track next to our train, going the same direction(!), and very slowly came to a stop(!!). Passengers started moving around, gathering their bags— are we being rescued? How do we all fit in that already packed train? Before we knew it, just like how it came, the train slowly started moving again, and minutes later, gone.
Now what? I’m sure I wasn’t the only one started calculating how much water and food might be in our luggage and in the dining car.
Apparently the other train dropped off some engineers, because soon there were a bunch of people in bright neon green and orange garb walking along the tracks, toward the head of our train.
More waiting. Thirty minutes later the train moved! And continued to run like nothing happened, till it unceremoniously stopped at the next station, Peterborough, where everyone was ordered to pack their things and depart, find their own ways. I guess all this was announced in the running gargles from the conductor, and I wasn’t the only one confused once we landed on the cold platform. Now it’s up to this tiny station to deal with hundreds of unexpected passengers heading to London, already delayed for hours.
You got to give it to the British for efficiency. The little station handled the glitch better than most American airports. The digital display spelled out clearly how many trains are passing and heading to Kings Cross in the next hour, which cars had seats, and what section of the platform had the best chance to get on the train. No one checked tickets. The bathroom queue went from over fifty to none. By the third train most people were out of the station and on their way to London.
I arrived at Kings Cross past 11pm, more than four hours after planned, cold and hungry. I was ready for a hot meal and warm bed.

Edinburgh during the fringe is a glorious celebration of the artistic spirit, with any tourist walking down the Royal Mile sure to be deluged with flyers from young people eager to promote their low-budget show. While having a coffee in George Square, I was approached by someone hawking a one-person re-enactment of the Titanic disaster, an improvised musical called Shamilton and a lady (with a haystack hairdo) impersonating Melania Trump.
But the image that most visitors will take away from the 2022 fringe is of overflowing rubbish bins and gutters strewn with discarded coffee cups and takeaway meal cartons. The binmen were on a two-week strike. The dispute has since spread through much of the rest of Scotland.
The refuse collectors are protesting about a 5% pay offer which they rightly point out will not match the rate of inflation. The pay “rise” is thus, in real terms, a pay cut. Small wonder that they are protesting.
But the speed with which Edinburgh descended into slovenliness is an illustration of the theme I wrote about in my last book, More; that our standard of living depends on the efforts and co-operation of millions of strangers. It is not just that we eat food that was grown on the other side of the world or rely on communication tools made in Asia. We depend on our fellow citizens to educate our children, keep us healthy, defend our borders and clean our streets.
This co-operation faces two interlinked threats. The first is that international trade in goods and services relies on a willingness to trust other countries, and to place economic interests above strategic desires. The first great era of globalisation in the late 19th century saw vast levels of migration from Europe to the “new worlds” of North and South America, and monetary co-operation that allowed the Bank of England to borrow from its counterparts in France and Russia when its gold reserves were low. But it all disintegrated with the outbreak of war in 1914; world trade (as measured by exports as a proportion of GDP) did not recover until the 1970s.
The late 19th century era has been dubbed the “pax Britannica” as Britain was the centre of the international monetary system (the gold standard) and, through its navy, ensured that global seaborne trade was safe from piracy. And the post-1945 era could be dubbed the “pax Americana” as the US supported its European (and Japanese allies) both militarily and economically. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the post-Mao change in Chinese economic policy brought most of the world into the global trading system.
Might we see another great reversal? There is little evidence of it in the data so far. But the rhetoric is headed in one direction: sanctions on Russia, tariffs on China and a determination in many countries, after the pandemic, to ensure that some strategically important goods are produced at home. The recent sabre-rattling of China over Taiwan might be an indicator of the next tipping point.
The second threat to co-operation lies in domestic politics. In part, this stems from globalisation which is perceived in many western countries as being good for the highly-educated elite but bad for ordinary workers. There has definitely been a slowdown in the growth rate of real earnings of the average worker in recent decades and in most countries, rising inequality. There is a vigorous debate among economists as to the causes of this shift with technological change playing at least as big a role as globalisation.
But this sluggish growth in real incomes has broken the contract between politicians and the people they govern, in which votes are supplied in return for increased prosperity. That has fuelled the disillusionment with politicians that was the subject of an earlier book of mine, The Last Vote. This discontent has meant constraints in democracy in some countries where its roots are shallow, such as Russia and Hungary. And in western countries it has led to the rise of “nativist” politicians like Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen, who imply that a “globalist” elite is plotting to undermine their countries.
How serious is this threat? It is easy to forget that Donald Trump lost the popular vote in both 2016 and 2020, taking office only because of the vagaries of the electoral college system. But his attempt to cling on to office in 2020 showed how tenuous are the institutional supports for democracy in the US; it was only the honesty of a few Republican officials in swing states that prevented him from stealing the election. In this category, one might add the outrageous attempt by the Conservative party to prorogue the British Parliament in 2019, a step that was blocked by the Supreme Court in an 11–0 decision.
In her book “How Civil Wars Start”, Barbara Walter details her research into the crucial factors that can cause a descent into chaos; excessive factionalism, the politics of resentment and the existence of armed groups. In particular, she refers to the existence of “anocracy” where a nominal democracy exists but the institutional structure that supports it (independent courts, a free press etc) have been undermined.
Anocracies can often descend into dictatorship, as Russia has shown. But they can head in another direction, as happened in Lebanon in the 1980s and Yugoslavia as the state’s authority disintegrates into regional and religious factions. Ms Walter is not predicting a re-enactment of the US Civil War of the 1860s, with uniformed armies fighting pitched battles, but a steady descent into chaos.
And if one looks at history, it is replete with examples of states disintegrating in the face of internal and external challenges. The western Roman empire was declining long before Rome was sacked in 410CE or Romulus Augustulus, the last emperor, was deposed in 476CE. The Hapsburg dynastic empire, steadily assembled over many centuries, disintegrated within weeks in 1918. Chaos is as likely an outcome as dictatorship.
The concept that Britain is only “four meals away from anarchy” has been used by MI5 to assess strategic risks and variations of the quote have been attributed to Lenin and the scifi writers Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. The original quote seems to have come from Alfred Henry Lewis back in 1896 who wrote” that the only barrier between us and anarchy is the last nine meals we’ve had” .
Back in the 1970s, a time when the country was rocked by high inflation, strikes and energy shortages, there was talk that Britain was “ungovernable”. There have been moments since then, notably during the riots of 2011, when the veneer of society has worn very thin.
The very connections that supply us with our food, energy and gadgets are also a source of our vulnerability, which could come in the form of embargoes, blockades or cyberattacks. Specialisation, which is at the heart of the modern economy, means that few of us have the means or the expertise to support ourselves.
Turmoil in America also affects the rest of the developed world since the post-1945 global settlement is built on the US’s economic and military strength. In 410CE, faced with Saxon incursions, the British wrote to Rome to appeal for help (according to one historical account). The emperor Honorius replied that they must look to their own defence. Isolationists in the US argue that Europe should do the same.
One can map out a future for the world in which the bonds that tie together the US and Europe disintegrate in the face of Russian and Chinese pressure, declining living standards provoke unrest at home which leads to violence on the streets, and public services break down leading to an even further decline in welfare.
This outcome is still only a possibility rather than a probability. But it is an outcome we should all consider before voting for those who would destroy the global economic structure.

I am a Student Ambassador with the University of Edinburgh. My job is to give tours of the university to visitors, prospective students and to anybody who is interested in the university. I mostly work for the department of Student Recruitment and Admissions and for Edinburgh Global, but I can be contracted by any department of the university. I am expected to help out on Open Days, School Visits, Alumni Events, teacher training sessions and on visits from International Delegations of other Universities.
On Open Days I give out leaflets, show people around the campus and just make them feel in general comfortable around the university.
In some cases I go on Schools visits either with my department of the School of Geosciences or the general student recruitment team.
Being a Student Ambassador is a real job with real pay. I even have a LinkedIn entry on it!
https://uk.linkedin.com/in/hunor-de%C3%A1k-458503121
I conduct university tours around the Central Campus/King’s Buildings, do office work, take part in student Q&A sessions, help with student support staff training, represent the university on school visits and help to organise/run university Open Days. I work for the Student Recruitment & Admissions, Edinburgh Global and Go Abroad Edinburgh.
Student Ambassadors are the face of the University of Edinburgh to prospective students, their parents/carers and teachers/advisers. The Student Ambassador team consists of 75 students, both UG and PG, from a range of Schools, Colleges, backgrounds and nationalities. The scheme is primarily designed to support the work of the Student Recruitment and Admissions Team and Edinburgh Global, however, from time to time Student Ambassadors have the opportunity to work for a range of other departments from around the University.
This is the official spiel. Looked over by university officials and decided in advance. To be honest I don’t really like this description, as it removes the honesty from my work.
In reality being a student ambassador is so much more than a job! It is a gift and an experience.
I get to work with a diverse range of people, and a diverse age range of people. I showed Primary school pupils around Appleton Tower, I introduced Scottish food to new students from around the globe and helped run an event at St Cecilia’s Hall for the old Alumni who graduated with the university 40–50 years ago. As a Student Ambassador I met such a nice number of people.
I worked under the wings of so many interesting university leaders as well.
Through the scheme I met so many fellow Student Ambassadors, that if I would have a thousand hands with hundreds of fingers I wouldn’t be able to count them! I met people from St. Petersburg, Florida, Vienna, the Netherlands, south California. I saw a wide range of departments from helping to host a music night to the alumni at St Cecilia’s Hall to handing out goodie bags to the newly graduated students of the University. I have done everything from office work for ERASMUS+ to waste management and moving boxes in the dungeons.
Being a Student Ambassador helped to improve my speaking skills, trained me to work better as a member of a group and gave me a greater range of confidence.
The University of Edinburgh is an ancient Scottish institution that educated the great Men of the Scottish Enlightenment, revolutionised the world of science and produced global leaders.
The university is a warm and welcoming place where I built up lots of skills for employment.
Step into the world that is the University of Edinburgh!

Peter Drake, a teacher from Hexham in Britain, spent many years in the classroom encouraging the learning of science. In recent years, Peter has found a new path in writing, music, and the arts. Today, he uses his experience to inspire others, proving that life after teaching can be just as rewarding and full of new adventures and doesn’t need to take place in the classroom.
Some cities make an impression the moment you arrive. Others take a little time, revealing their beauty and character slowly. Edinburgh, however, is in a category all of its own — a place that doesn’t just leave an impression but sears itself into your memory, heart, and soul. For me, Edinburgh’s allure is most powerful during that extraordinary moment each year when the Edinburgh Festival Fringe transforms the city into the beating heart of global creativity.
Every August, this historic Scottish capital erupts into life, laughter, noise, and energy. Streets that are usually relatively calm thrum with a chaotic symphony of buskers, actors, dancers, musicians, and visitors from all corners of the world. Cafés spill over with animated conversation, parks host pop-up performances, and every available space — from traditional theatres to tiny basements — is pressed into service for the arts. If ever a city could wear joy like a cloak, it is Edinburgh during the Fringe.
I feel deeply connected to Edinburgh, not least because of my own unforgettable experience of the Fringe. Some years ago, my play, The Prisoner’s Friend, was performed during the festival. Seeing a piece of writing, crafted over months of quiet work, take on a new life before an audience of strangers in such a vibrant setting was a defining moment for me. There is something intoxicating about watching people react to your words — to hear them laugh, to see them fall silent with emotion, to feel that invisible thread of understanding stretch between stage and audience. For anyone who has created, performed, or even simply spectated during the Fringe, the memory leaves an indelible mark.
During that month, the city itself becomes more than just a backdrop; it feels like an active participant in the festival. The ancient streets and winding closes seem to lean in, listening. The grand, stern buildings of the New Town provide a dramatic stage set, while the narrow, atmospheric lanes of the Old Town whisper history and secrets around every corner. There’s a profound sense that Edinburgh is uniquely suited to house such an explosion of creativity — a city proud of its culture, deeply aware of its own myths and legends, yet refreshingly willing to let loose and celebrate the new.
Of course, part of what makes the Fringe experience so powerful is the sense of freedom it offers. Nowhere else in the world can so many performers, both seasoned professionals and complete beginners, share space so democratically. Whether your production has a massive budget or is fueled solely by passion and a few hand-painted posters, the Fringe offers a platform. It is, at heart, a celebration of taking a risk, of putting yourself and your art in front of the world without guarantees or safety nets.
That spirit permeated everything during the time I spent there. Days were crammed with rehearsals, flyering on the Royal Mile, frantic last-minute set changes, and post-show discussions in packed pubs. Nights were filled with laughter, new friendships, and a thrilling sense of community. For one glorious month, you become part of a tribe — a massive, sprawling, creative tribe that welcomes anyone willing to leap into the unknown.
I often think about those August days and nights, and the way they stand in contrast to the quieter months when the festival has packed up and the city breathes a little easier. Yet even outside of August, Edinburgh remains magnificent. Climb Arthur’s Seat for a panoramic view of a city that seamlessly marries medieval and modern. Walk through the peaceful elegance of the Georgian New Town, with its perfectly symmetrical streets and squares. Explore the mysteries of the Old Town, where narrow closes and hidden courtyards make you feel as though you might step into another century.
And always, whether it’s August or April, the city’s commitment to culture shines through. From the National Museum of Scotland to the Scottish National Gallery, from the historic libraries to the storytelling centres, Edinburgh is a place where history, art, and ideas are not just preserved but celebrated.
For me personally, the emotional connection to Edinburgh will always be anchored in that heady, transformative experience of the Fringe. It’s not just about the performances or the audiences — it’s about being part of something larger than yourself. It’s about feeling, even for a brief time, that you are contributing to a shared celebration of imagination, creativity, and human connection.
Every year when August rolls around, I feel a twinge of longing. I picture the crowds gathering, the pop-up stages going up, the laughter echoing down the cobbled streets. I imagine first-time performers nervously stepping onto stages, writers seeing their characters come to life, audiences discovering unexpected delights in hidden venues.
Few who have performed at the Fringe ever forget it. The highs are high, the lows can be humbling, but the memories are golden. Whether your show draws a full house or plays to a handful, whether you win awards or simply win the respect of your peers, the experience changes you. It reminds you that art matters. That risk matters. That connection — raw, real, immediate connection — is what we all crave, and occasionally, in a special place like Edinburgh during the Fringe, we find it.
In a world that sometimes feels increasingly fragmented and divided, that spirit of celebration and connection feels more precious than ever. And so I will always hold Edinburgh close — not just as a stunning city of history and beauty, but as a place where, for a brief, shining moment, anything feels possible.

“This is a city of shifting light, of changing skies, of sudden vistas. A city so beautiful it breaks the heart again and again.”
― Alexander McCall Smith
As the sun rises, I watch the city of Edinburgh slowly revealed… a dark foggy nothingness giving way to a thousand rooftops accented by a spire here and there, dark and unfocused at first, but gradually taking on shape, form, and color. Finally, the edge of the sun peeks over the horizon and dazzling light spills into and across the room, putting a sudden and audible end to muffled conversations.
The bride and groom touch, and she whispers something softly into his ear. Both turn to look out the open window. On the table beside them, a once-full bottle of fine malt, a dozen empty glasses, and a stone jug of spring water sit where they were last touched.
“Wow… Look at that!” from the kilted man wearing the splendid red uniform tunic.
I have no words to adequately describe the scene being painted below as the sun continues its steady, lazy morning stretch, revealing a hilltop here, a wisp of smoke from a chimney there, the ancient castle perched to our left, and the blue ocean in the distance bathed…

Let’s all collectively ignore that this article is late (I need a lot of grace these days 😭)
Hi guys! It’s been a HOT minute (ironically😅). I know, I take full responsibility for my prolonged absence. The past several months have been a lot; mentally, emotionally, and physically. I can only say thank God for His grace through it all.
I have a lot to say and so much gist for you guys
The first thing I’d like to share is the different aspects of my first half-year on the other side of the globe.
Transportation
One of my favourite things about living here is the transportation system. Gone are the days of fighting passengers to enter a bus and fighting bus conductors for change. The transportation system I have experienced here (mostly buses) is more comfortable and seamless.
Most buses I’ve used are double-decker with an upper level for passengers to sit. Bus fares are paid with exact amounts, prepaid bus cards, free bus travel cards, or contactless payment methods. And yes, I said free bus travel. Scotland has free bus travel for under 22s, over 60s and disabled travellers.
There are accessibility accommodations on buses such as designated seats for elderly travellers, disabled travellers, and people with buggies.
For the most part, you don’t have to wait endlessly for the bus. Bus delays are often communicated on electronic displays at bus stops and Google Maps (which is usually more accurate). Any changes in bus stops or bus routes are well communicated to passengers in advance.
Besides the buses, there are trams and trains, modes of transportation that I wasn’t familiar with before living here. Cycling is also a thing here (I’ve even tossed around the idea of getting a bicycle a few times).
Since being here, I have learnt to embrace walking as part of my everyday life. These days a 21-minute walk is just a nice little exercise. The roads are well-designed to accommodate pedestrian traffic and motorists obey traffic rules, so I no longer have hypertension whenever I cross the road.
Compared to how clueless I was when I first arrived, I’ve largely settled into making my way downtown, walkin’ fast faces pass and I’m home-bound (tadadadadada). Ma da mi loun, I’m not a serious geh😜
Every once in a while though, I miss the thrill of rushing around and the fun of Danfo drama, I’m a Lagos girl after all.
Advice: Wear comfortable shoes, walking becomes a part of you
Weather
The stark difference in weather has been the most jarring part of moving to Edinburgh. I’ve never lived in a place with four actual seasons before and it’s an experience I can’t fully express. So far, I’ve experienced Winterrrr 🥶, gorgeous Spring, Summer (ish), and Autumn-yet to be decided.
Winter almost broke me😭
It was cold, or as the wobble-headed narrator of the Oversimplified YouTube channel says “STUPID COLD!” I made many a perilous journey to and from class, but like they say, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger 💪🏽. I held out hope every freezing day, for the relief of a warm summertime that everyone seemed to eagerly expect.
UNFORTUNATELY, it was all a SCAM! 😭
Spring was cold, Summer was cold, Autumn is COLD.
Oh, and apart from the low temperatures, there are wind speeds that go over vehicle speed limits and rains that appear out of nowhere. It is a fascinating experience.
Am I used to it? I don’t think it’s something to get used to honestly. I want to get used to nice things; like someone spending money on me, living a baby girl lifestyle, you know, nice things.
Advice: Expect any weather, and always carry an umbrella
The Environment, The People
Scotland is beautiful and Edinburgh is stunning.
As erratic as the weather can be here, the skies are a deep and beautiful shade of blue, the sun (when it decides to grace us with its presence) shoots down golden rays to illuminate the greenery, and on the rarest of occasions, I have seen the most perfectly coloured rainbows adorn a pale-bright sky.
The city is a spectacular landscape surrounded by hills and dotted with the most luscious trees and shrubs. Breathtaking (see Exhibit A below). Exploring Edinburgh’s rich scenery, heritage and uniqueness deserves a post of its own (coming soon? fingers crossed)
Now for the people.
At this point, I’m pretty sure Scottish people don’t speak English. They speak a language only they can understand. Fair warning: if you can understand English, don’t expect to automatically understand Scottish English.
Picture this: You go to eat at a fancy with a whole bar section for drinks. You look at the list of nice-sounding beverages and decide you're too broke (for now) to afford them, so you walk up to the bar and ask for a glass of water. You’re greeted with a smile and a nod. “This is going well.” you think as the bartender fills a glass with tap water (don’t worry, it’s clean). You’re about to stretch your hand when the bartender asks “Dyu like some aeyce?” Now you’re lost. “What is aeyce?” “Does it cost extra?” “How do I respond?”.
The bartender senses the activation of your flight-freeze response and points at the ice bucket next to the counter. Ice. He’s asking if you want ice 🤦🏽‍♀️
Excuse me for that long scenario, I haven’t written fiction in a while and I quite enjoyed that.
Back to the story.
Their weird rendition of English aside, I see Scottish people like regular people, with the good and the not-so-good. There’s a general “mind your business” vibe here which isn’t necessarily good or bad. However, seeing some of the effects of this way of life has made me appreciate that the cultural system of community involvement in personal and interpersonal matters can be quite valuable.
Edinburgh is full of people from all over the world, which is expected of any tourist city. Going from a racially homogenous place like Nigeria to a vastly multicultural hub like this is like exploring a whole new world. I have heard many new languages, seen many new faces and experienced many new cultures.
Side note: I finally ate Chinese, Indian and Italian food; it was all delicious, you should try them too.
Community (Nigerian shops, Nigerian students, Nigerian food)
This probably goes without saying, but there are Nigerians in Edinburgh. There are Nigerian grocery shops and hairstylists in Edinburgh. Just as in places like London and Manchester, there is a flourishing Nigerian community in Edinburgh.
When I arrived at my school, I was surprised to be surrounded by Nigerians in class and at the hostel. In some ways, it felt like I never left Nigeria. Ironically, I have learnt more about Nigeria in Edinburgh than I ever learnt in Nigeria.
Having a community of people who can relate to my perspective is refreshing. I’ve made some great friends here who are simply amazing.
Side note: I’ve also made friends from other countries; trust me, it’s not as hard as it seems.
I’m loving my time here in Edinburgh, and getting that nice abroad weight gain (no exhibits here). I’ll share more about my life in Edinburgh as time goes on. Let me know any specific things you want me to talk about😊.
I’ll try not to disappear for too long next time. Thank you for your constant support and patience. I love you guys!

Since 2016, Edinburgh council has slowly been rolling out on-street storage for cyclists. In the last year, the number of hangars has doubled from 100 to over 200.
64% of Edinburgh households live in flats, and we know that finding somewhere to store a bicycle is one of the more important barriers to people moving around on two wheels. With about 300,000 people in capital in such a predicament, and with 6 spots per cycle hangar… you can do the maths.
One hangar location near Stockbridge has 142 people on the waiting list.
It is therefore not a surprise that the new hangars are massively over-subscribed. The waiting list has grown to 3,400, including those in the queue for an existing hangar and those who have requested one.
This latent demand for cycling is being realised, and in a big way. As new hangars go in they become a visible part of our public realm and more and more people become aware of them.
As things stand, the council will need to install a further 560 hangars to meet demand. Over 1,000 people joined the queue in the last year or so; if replicated this year, that’s another 170 hangars required on top of that.
Yet the council only has plans for around another 160.
Each cycle hangar takes up the space taken by one car. Parking permits are a significant source of revenue for the council. But so are cycle hangars…
At full price, a cycle hangar spot costs £72 per year. That compares favourably with car parking, which is either free in most of the city, or £36.50 for a zero carbon emissions car (except in the very centre of the city, where it’s £73.70).
Taking that £36.50 figure, each hangar will generate 12 times as much revenue as a car parking spot. That doesn’t take into account maintenance costs of the hangars, but after all the negative externalities associated with cars… it’s a good investment.
Indeed, if the council were a private business, they’d push those prices up even higher to meet demand.
Cycle hangars have been so far placed in the more prosperous parts of the city; Marchmont, Newington, Bruntsfield, Portobello — you get the picture. This is efficient work from the council as most of the demand for the cycle hangars is located in these areas.
However, conscious of the social inequity of providing such infrastructure in only the richer parts of town, a number of hangars have been located in areas of high deprivation. Even better, these are provided at a subsidised cost of only £1.50 a month.
This has not been successful. Some of these hangars are those few that have not been populated by bicycles. It is my view that the barriers to cycling for those on the lowest incomes remain the relatively large capital investment associated with the bicycle itself. The low cost and low risk associated with Lothian Buses’ excellent service is difficult to beat.
An interactive map of hangars, waiting lists and demand can be found here: LINK
This article has been based on a Freedom of Information request to Edinburgh City Council, which you can find here: LINK
While there is precise location data for existing hangars, requests for hangars are made on a street-by-street basis. I have used the postcode associated with each street and used the centroid of that postcode area to map requests.

I stood at the gated entrance on Candlemaker Row of the 16th-century Greyfriars Kirkyard. The wind whipped the leafless trees, and the sky threatened to rain. The weather was suitable for exploring a graveyard, especially one that proclaims to be the most haunted graveyard in the world in one of the most haunted cities, Edinburgh, Scotland.
Although I had not been there before, there was something familiar about the place as soon as I walked in.
It was my second visit to Edinburgh, and this time, I returned in January when the hordes of tourists were gone. I had seen the city’s most well-known sights, like Edinburgh Castle, Holyrood Palace, and the Royal Mile, which left me free to explore lesser-known places.
Greyfriars Kirkyard piqued my interest as I read a list of suggested things to do in Edinburgh. The graveyard was established during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots, and was full of victims from the Black Plague and the witch hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries, in which around four thousand…

Hello again from my work world developing a new ten-year fund for communities in Edinburgh to work together as part of a wider system to work in regenerative ways to get deep into the root causes of big issues in our city— poverty, racism and climate change.
I’ve never written as consistently about one topic before — this is my 15th blog in a series about developing Regenerative Futures Fund, with another 4 in there about Funding Utopias.
In April 2024 my writing was about Inching Closer to Launch, closing off and reflecting on our wonderful co-design groups.
In September 2024 I mused about Good Hosting, Floating and Anchoring, when I was feeling grateful for all who supported the more ‘behind the scenes things’ — WHALE Arts, EVOC and Foundation Scotland.
And then more recently I reflected on working with poets on our Collective Imagination programme and our beautiful poetry anthology All That Is Needed Is A Dream.
So — here is my more general Regenerative Futures Fund update for the second half of 2024 and first part of 2025🌿
This was also shared on our Regenerative Futures Fund ‘News & Notes’ section in February 2025 — a PDF of the update copied below can be downloaded here.
1. Fund Design — Process, Participation & Programme
2. Recruitment and Team Development
3. Communications and Open Working
4. Governance Ecosystem (and Hosting)
5. Fundraising and Contracting
6. Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability and Learning (MEAL)
7. Field Building & Systems — Learning Partnerships, Sharing the Model
If anything chimes, please do get in touch
Please do get in touch if you have any questions or you’d like to get involved: Leah Black (Co-Head) — leah@foundationscotland.org.uk

Edinburgh’s charm is so idyllic, it’s been a muse to writers for centuries. It’s only fitting that this is where the Kimpton Charlotte Square sits, a serene hideaway, full to overflowing with everything needed for a romantic escape. I recently stayed two nights there on a wedding anniversary tour of Edinburgh where I found four reasons why this hotel is the most romantic in the city.
Follow the author to be notified when new luxury travel articles are published.
Close your eyes and imagine a scene from a classic piece of literature (one of the cheerier volumes). What you dreamed up likely comes very close to the Kimpton Charlotte Square. A wicker basket props up black Mary Poppins umbrellas next to a stately Georgian door. Red bicycles fitted with silver bells patiently wait for their next outing on a herringbone tile floor. A dancing fire in a massive stone fireplace warms the room and the mood. A couple chats animatedly in the library and garden greenery weaves its way from the outdoors in, bringing a taste of a summer garden with it. This was what greeted us as we explored the common rooms on our first night. Even story settings don’t get as romantic as this.
On our second night, we decided to take a dip in the indoor swimming pool. There’s nothing like a spontaneous swim, taken purely for fun (with no attempt to get a workout in) to bring up memories of the exciting first rush of love. Do try it.
When the day draws you and your love outside, Edinburgh is at your feet, literally. Kimpton Charlotte Square is in New Town (built between 1767 and 1890 while Old Town is medieval). Shops full of Harris Tweed tartan handbags and beautifully packaged shortbread biscuits, plus one-of-a-kind treasures are two to ten minutes away on foot. Edinburgh wasn’t bombed as badly as London was during WW2, so the gorgeous period architecture is laid out in unbroken ribbons along the city’s cobbled streets. The baked goods in Edinburgh are second-to-none. If you’ve never tried chocolate and caramel-topped millionaire shortbread, you haven’t lived. Don’t miss out; it will transform your expectations of dessert forever. Cabs or buses are plentiful when it’s time to go to Old Town. Or, if you don’t mind a very scenic walk, Old Town can be reached in about 20 minutes on foot. As you’re bound to get distracted constantly by fabulous shops and scenery, plan for more.
Discovering a tin full of goodies in the room was my first delightful foodie surprise. Rich chocolate bars and well-chosen savoury snacks fed my habit of late-night snacking on both nights of our stay. Even better was dinner on our second night. We ate our fill at BABA, a restaurant that feels like the best version of a Middle Eastern bazaar. BABA is a vibrantly hued maze of open areas that buzz with conversation, and intimate tables framed with heavy velvet curtains, made for a quiet meal. My hummus and pita bread was so wonderful, I nearly skipped to dessert. I’m glad I didn’t though, as the cod with grilled celeriac and cashews was tender and flavourful. My husband had the pork with red pepper ketchup, feta cheese and banana chilies, which he must have loved as he cleaned his plate.
For variety, there are two other restaurants on-site, Aizle (featuring a six-course tasting menu) and The Garden, a scenic, light-filled café that serves coffee and sandwiches until 3 PM.
After dinner and a day of exploration, I craved a hot shower and soft bed. I got both in our beautiful one-bedroom partitioned suite that overlooked the front steps of the hotel and Charlotte Square beyond. The suite’s sitting room and bedroom are separated by a partial wall under a high ceiling. Of all the room’s brilliant décor, I liked the drawing of wily rabbits best — its outright whimsy juxtaposed nicely with the downy velvet drapes and refined upholstered sofa. The super king bed’s duvet was so nice — crisp, spotless, and had just the right weight. Snuggling under it while watching TV and reliving our day surrounded by a beautiful room full of beautiful things was wonderful and terribly romantic.
As I write this, I want to go back and package up the room to bring home and make ours, but I suppose the fantasy needs to stay in Edinburgh where it fits to tailor-made perfection.
The Kimpton Charlotte Square is a fantastic hotel in a city that falls in my top three world-wide. I particularly recommend the hotel to couples looking for a romantic getaway as it is the most romantic hotel in Edinburgh. Tip: For access to the best selection of room types and seasonal specials, book directly on Kimpton Charlotte Square’s official website.
It wasn’t until I caught sight of the building that I realised I had been a guest of the hotel before, years ago. At that time it had another name. I am delighted with the improvements Kimpton has made. I liked the hotel very much before, but it is even better now, particularly in the areas of interior design and cuisine. Kudos to Kimpton!
My gratitude to Naomi Cameron of 3x1 for expertly arranging my time at the hotel. Thank you, Naomi! You’re a credit to your company.

On my way out of Edinburgh I stopped for my final EB in the land of kilts, sporrans, and Harris Tweed. My suitcase was bulging with Scotch Whiskey miniatures, a framed picture of puffins, and a natty little hat that would absolutely suit the Canberra winter, but not the Scottish Summer.
I was catching the train from Edinburgh Station down to Guildford to see my Dad before flying home to Aussie. Being so close, six hours of trains, I couldn’t possibly pass up the chance to pop in. My train wasn’t until 11am, so PLENTY of time to feast first.
I had seen the menu in the window a few days before on one of my walks and decided it looked like the sort of place that would either do a really good EB or monumentally stuff it up by trying to be too innovative.
I was seated in a booth with a brass topped table, and green velvet seats which I sank into. Looking around, there was nary a hard chair in the joint. Even the wooden dining chairs had a plush cushion to rest the weary buttocks.
I ordered a latte, orange juice, and classic Eggs Benedict that included Ayrshire Smoked Bacon, Toasted Muffin, Poached Eggs, Hollandaise Sauce. The menu kept it simple, so I thought, it going to be plain and simple.
It wasn’t, of course it wasn’t. I was in the Grand Cafe. They had the date on either side of the name. 1905. The chandeliers sparkled. The stained glass was clean. The stairs marble.
It came on a hand-turned ceramic plate, with spotlessly clean, shiny, cutlery (flatware, for the Americans). Baby spinach and toasted onion flakes adorned as garnish. The sauce, while pale, WAS HOUSE MADE!
Hallelujah.
I’ll be honest. I devoured it. It looked appetising, smelled fabulous, and tasted tangy with lemon as the acid in the sauce. The eggs, which I forgot to photograph because I was too busy scoffing them, where cooked to perfection with golden yolks and no egg snot.
After I had eaten, I used a few drinks mats to write some tanka about my Edinburgh stay. A couple of days before I had bunked off the conference to go and see some wildlife in the wild.

When you walk the charming cobbled streets of Edinburgh’s Old Town, it’s easy to fall in love with the history. The gothic spires. The storytellers. The whiskey.
But beneath your feet lies another version of the city — one that most people don’t talk about unless they’re on a ghost tour.
One that’s still very much alive in its own way.
Welcome to the Edinburg Vaults, a network of stone chambers built in the late 1700s beneath South Bridge. They were meant for businesses and storage. But the vaults were dark, damp, and poorly ventilated — so they were quickly abandoned.
But not forgotten.
Soon after, the city’s poorest moved in. Families without homes, criminals, the sick, the unwanted.
People lived — and died — in these cold, airless rooms.
Disease spread quick. Murders went unnoticed.
And when the authorities eventually sealed the vaults, many believe they buried more than just stone and wood. They buried people alive.

Liberal Arts Blog — Friday is the Joy of Art, Architecture, Design, Film, and All Things Visual Day
Today’s Topic: Edinburgh: Raphael, “The Holy Family,” Velazquez “Old Lady Frying Eggs,” and Church “Niagara”
Last week, Vienna. Two weeks ago, Stockholm. Three weeks ago, Moscow. This week, Edinburgh — as we continue the tour of European art galleries to which I have never been. The first of today’s picks is from the Italian Renaissance, the second from the Spanish Golden Age, and the third from the Hudson River School of mid-19th century America. Experts — please chime in. Correct, elaborate, elucidate.
RAPHAEL (1483–1520) “The Holy Family with the Palm Tree” (1506)
1. What is most striking about this scene is the prominence of Joseph.
2. Most Holy Family scenes have a focus on Jesus or Mary.
3. Can any experts provide any enlightenment on this score?
NB: Raphael is most famous for “The School of Athens” — one of four frescoes in the “Stanza della Segnatura” in the Apostolic Museum in the Vatican in Rome. Tragically, he died young, allegedly from too much sex, on Good Friday, 1520, which was, according to Vasari, also his birthday.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael
DIEGO VELAZQUEZ (1599–1660) “Old Lady Frying Eggs” (1618) — “chiaroscuro” and photographic realism
1. The eggs look like fried eggs from a distance but if you look closely you will see that they are swimming in a liquid and are probably better described as poached.
2. Case study in “chiaroscuro” — “with a strong light source coming in from the left illuminating the woman, her utensils and the poaching eggs, while throwing the background and the boy standing to her right into deep shadow. Here the chiaroscuro is very intense, so much so that it would be impossible to see the wall at the bottom of the painting but for the basket hanging from it; it simultaneously manages to combine the murky darkness and high contrasts of light and shadow with the use of subtle hues and a palette dominated by ochres and browns. The composition is organized as an oval with the middle figures in the nearest plane, thus drawing in the viewer.”
3. “The realism is nearly photographic and shows everyday plates, cutlery, pans, pestles, jugs and mortars, capturing the special shine on a glass surface and the light’s play on the melon carried by the boy. The boiling pan is particularly well-captured, with its reflections and the whites of the eggs. Velázquez also worked particularly hard on the detail of the two figures’ hands.”
NB: Velazquez was the great painter of the second half of the “Spanish Golden Age” (the “Siglo de Oro”) under the reign of Philip IV (1605–1665). El Greco (1541–1641) — was the master of the first half under Philip II (1527–1598).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez
FREDERICK CHURCH (1826–1900) “Niagara Falls, from the American Side” (1867)
1. Church was a member of the “Hudson River School” of American artists. Their theme was “sublime” nature and the “awe” it inspires.
2. Nothing captures this theme better than Niagara Falls which became a metaphor for the “manifest destiny” of the United States.
3. This is Church’s largest painting (8 feet by 7 feet) and the only one of his paintings in a European collection.
NB: Church’s most influential rendering of Niagara (from the Canadian side) was painted ten years earlier. See second link below.

That the love of typewriters is a thing, becomes evident from Somsubhra Banerjee’s article that inspired this one. Such passion for outdated technology does not come naturally to me. Yet, I came to appreciate the charming appearance of typewritten verse in 2022 after my visit to Typewronger Books in Edinburgh, Scotland.
It was not love at first sight. I slowly descended the steps to an unpretentious-looking bookstore’s entrance. In true Harry Potteresque style that is so characteristic of Edinburgh, Scotland, the “entrance” gave away absolutely nothing. I might as well have opened what looked like a basement door and found myself in Diagon Alley on the other side!
Little did I know, that I would spend the next two hours with family rummaging through entertaining accounts written by independent writers, some graduates of the University of Edinburgh’s famous creative writing programs, and many other intriguing but unknown gems. Well, that shouldn’t be surprising in the world’s first city designated as a “City of Literature” by UNESCO.
It turns out that this bookstore specialises in selling, but also repairing old typewriters. That someone would take the pains to get an old dysfunctional typewriter repaired for a cost sounded absurd to me.
The book wizard at the front desk was kind enough to share snippets of how many writers still prefer to write on typewriters. Or how he has a typewriter there which when my daughter click-clacked, would generate a tweet! And, how he had sold metres and metres of books as “home office decoration” during the great golden age of Zoom (2020–22)!
What fascinated me the most, however, was how captivated I was with all the typewriters they had on display. Turquoise, mint green, plain white but also the classic grandfather typewriters — black with black keys and golden alphabets etched on them.
Since that rainy afternoon, seeing typewritten words on the paper now mesmerises me. Those stark black and white angular letters seem to have a personality of their own. Have you read verses of poetry that just feel more alive on Instagram because they are typewritten? There is magic in them. If I can now see it, could this be some kind of literary spiritual awakening I underwent at Typewronger?
Typewriters haven’t gone completely out of fashion despite their more sophisticated and user-friendly competitors such as laptops and tablets. Surprisingly, they have held on to their niche and achieved cult status. It makes me wonder if some part of our current less efficient, cumbersome, but infinitely more charming and deeper way of writing, will unexpectedly preserve itself despite the advent of easier, lazier AI tools. Anyway, I digress…
It makes me wonder why. Perhaps, a typewriter, the way it feels to exert your fingers on its keys and the resulting click-clack sound allows a writer to feel like a music composer. After all, music is just a more mystical form of writing, isn’t it?
Or does it allow her to take on the identity of Hemingway, or perhaps, Anne Lamott, as types away? Similar to the purpose a bottle of rum would serve, or perhaps, an old, white, soft-beyond-description t-shirt. Is it a getting-into-character exercise for literary minds? Or does it evoke nostalgia for a lost, golden era of literature that she painfully tries to access, but only through its relics — typewriters?
Who knows? Do tell me if you give writing on a typewriter a shot one fine day. And if you were to bust it, you now know where to get it repaired!

It is Festival season in Edinburgh. Tens of thousands of visitors have flocked in the city, from everywhere, many from abroad. The streets are crowded, buses cannot keep to their schedules, and most people react to the misery of long queues and delays cheerfully. I think there is the acceptance that if one wished to live in one of the most civilised cities in Europe, there must be a small price to pay. Coming out of the Assembly, where I had been to watch The Life and Times of Michael K, based on J.M.Coetzee’s novel, it was nearly 3.00 p.m. and I had not had lunch yet. So when I reached the bus stop just outside the Central Library, my heart sank when I saw a long queue waiting. I checked the electronic indicator, and was not surprised that it was not in operation, and therefore had no information about how long a wait there would be. An elderly lady, a sprightly nonagenarian, next to whom I found myself caught the little grimace I made, and nodded at me in sympathy, and I thought that to pass the time, one could indulge in a little conversation. You’ve been to a show, ma’am? I asked. Her eyes twinkled, as no doubt she too welcomed a chat to pass the time. No, she responded, but she was at the Usher Hall last night to catch that Korean orchestra playing Mozart. Was it good? I asked. It was superlative, she said, but had more to say.
‘I marvel at these people who are open to an alien culture and produce such excellent work,’ she said, ‘and ask myself, What do we know of Asian culture?’ Yes, I responded, the Koreans, like the Japanese and the Chinese, are excellent interpreters of Western classical music. Had I seen any good shows this year? She asked. I told her about Michael K, and added that I too had seen a delightful Korean opera, Trojan Woman, and said that it was one of the best shows that I had caught in the last few years.Yes, she said, they are a very cultured people. I then thought I should pay her a compliment.
‘I am surprised and pleased that you think so,’ I said.
‘But I was born in Penang,’ she blurted out, ‘my father was district officer in the thirties.’ And she told me that she had lived in Malaya until she was twelve, and then spent time in Jakarta as well. To my surprise she revealed that she used to be fluent in bahasa. My son was in Bogor for two or three years, I said, teaching TEFL. I had to add that my father too had spent time in Indonesia in the twenties.
Suddenly her eyes lit up again, and she said, ‘Oh I have to tell you this, it’s so marvellous.’ She had been shopping, and when it was time to pay, realised that she did not have her purse any more. She was upset and panicking, and to her amazement a young fellow came towards her brandishing her purse, which he had picked down the road. ‘Aren’t people marvellous?’ I had to tell her my own story of how, travelling from Lagos to Kontagora, a 15 hour journey I realised that I too had lost my purse.
‘I informed the driver, and he made an announcement, and someone stood up and walked towards me with my purse. Is it yours?’
‘So you must have travelled a fair bit too?’ I nodded, and told her that I came from Mauritius_’
That’s where the dodo came from?
The dodo and me, I added facetiously.
‘Oh,’ she asked suddenly, I know it’s a stupid question, but seeing you come from Mauritius, do you know dentist Chong Kwan? He used to be my dentist until last year when he sadly passed away.’ I had heard the name in Mauritius, and besides I remember my dentist brother talking about a dentist Chong Kwan. I figured out that her dentist Chong Kwan must have been the son of my brother’s colleague.
And I filled her in on what I had done since I came to the UK in 1959. Then a Number 27 bus appeared.
‘Now that I’ve been enjoying talking to you, I’d have been happy to wait some more,’ she said. Although I was quite hungry, I agreed with her.
‘Hope we can find seats together,’ she said, ‘because I’ve been enjoying our talk.’
Sadly, as the bus was fairly packed, she found a seat in front and I at the back. It seemed like an anti-climax, but two stops down her neighbour alighted, and I was able to move in with her. We continued together until Tollcross, where we both got out, she having decided to walk home, whilst I too tired to walk opted for another bus.
‘I’ll look out for you, and you do the same, we’re bound to meet again,’ she said cheerfully.

From Abuja to Edinburgh: my 1st semester experience as a Mastercard Foundation Scholar at the University of Edinburgh,https://medium.com/@mirabellemorah/from-abuja-to-edinburgh-my-1st-semester-experience-as-a-mastercard-foundation-scholar-at-the-80b3fc2ec550,"Sign up

This will humorously walk you through some of my experiences these past 3 months as a Scholar, from settling into Edinburgh to being blown away by heavy winds. See the end for scholarship application tips.
My first few weeks in the UK were both exciting and uneasy.
The Mastercard Foundation team at the University of Edinburgh have been incredible and helpful in everything. Once I got the scholarship, they guided me in applying to the university, gave travel guidance (before arriving) and helped me settle-in (on arrival).
Before I moved to start my postgrad, the past months were not easy. I experienced an armed robbery attack in the middle of the night (funny part in hindsight was that the first thing I hid was my passport). I went from that to being exhausted in the months that followed, to overthinking, etc. So arriving in Scotland, jumping into a new environment, new system and getting used to the pattern and methods of postgraduate lectures were not things I immediately settled into. It took two months for my beating heart to calm down. As they say, it’s not (only) the situation that makes you unhappy; your thoughts about it count.
I’ve explored several places in Scotland. We had a calming retreat at the Burn in Glenesk, Brechin. I visited the University of St. Andrews to watch a Rugby Match (both courtesy of Mastercard Foundation). Then I visited Glasgow to spend an evening with Gerry Higgins (Social Enterprise World Forum’s founder), his family, and Maeve Curtin.
Before Edinburgh (UK), I’d already visited circa 12/13 countries, but I’ve never been used to the transport systems of many places. So I’m slowly learning (because I walk to most of my destinations) to use Edinburgh’s public transportation, from trams to trains to buses.
As a Nigerian, you know all that hassle of looking for how to convert your naira to USD and how to buy stuff on Amazon or pay for some Apple subscription etc? Nah! That stuff is hectic abeg! It was a relief to get a multi-currency card in the UK that allowed me access different currencies. I could use a Revolut card to buy groceries in the UK with GBP and use it in the Netherlands to move around in EUR. Nice stuff.
An imaginary bank card I designed for “Bank of Womandla”. This was inspired by my course on Entrepreneurial Finance as well as one of my professors, Francis Green who encouraged us to imagine borrowing from “Bank of Francis” to fund our business ideas.
Using MTN? Remember to keep your MTN line. Here’s how.
You must find your own way of learning and dealing with course load. My postgraduate studies are on innovation and entrepreneurship, and before attending lectures and seminars, I need to read several papers. Some things that help me are to:
“This presentation was led by a fantastic first speaker who really nailed the presentation of the pitch. Ably supported by the second speaker, the pitch presentation was authoritative and slick. The video was really helpful in that it showed that attention had been given to how the pitch was to be presented…”
– Part of the academic feedback we received
Naturally, the Mastercard Scholars programme is already a HUGE community and network. The Foundation’s team organises several leadership lab sessions for scholars to learn. A Chevening scholar once attended an end-of-year event I co-organised with Kish (my fellow scholar representative) and said he liked the community we had amongst us. I’ve always believed in the power of mutually connecting with people beyond my studies, learning from others, sharing knowledge and strategically showing up for things.
So far:
I’ve been in the UK for 3 months. I haven’t seen snow in my part of Edinburgh (yet). The wind has tried to blow me away several times. I don’t know how to use a vending machine yet. I make better illustrations now. I’m better at making business valuations. And one of my favourite actions remains to keep asking more questions.
I am a huge advocate for rest. I budget heavy doses of rest and sleep in between all of my hard work. I believe in “less is more.” I believe in prayers and mindfulness. I believe in play, and in disconnecting to recharge.
P.S. for the title, no I didn’t live in Abuja. I flew out of Nigeria, from Abuja to Edinburgh.

Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, is very recognized, I would say, for its fascinating history and breathtaking architecture. It’s obviously also the perfect jumping-off point for seeing Scotland’s lovely scenery and cute towns. For anyone wanting to sneak away for a bit, there actually are a handful of cracking half day trips from Edinburgh where you can see Scotland’s highlights, so it’s almost effortless to squeeze them into your schedule. Whether you’re crazy about nature, into old stories, or very fancy seeing something a bit different, you, like your travel companions, might unearth just the thing not far from town. Let’s take a peep at, like, five ace half-day outings around Edinburgh!
Near Edinburgh, the Scottish Highlands are rather unmissable. You could grab a half-day tour, arguably offering spectacular sights featuring the mountains, lochs and valleys. This outing is truly grand, specifically for outdoorsy types and anyone needing some calm. A fair few tours drop you at spots I feel are well-known such as Loch Ness and Ben Nevis, basically to give you, like your travel partners, a glimpse of the magnificent countryside Scotland is so celebrated for.
Stirling Castle, not far from Edinburgh on the train, is so perfect for folk who find the olden days fascinating. It’s that sort of ancient fort providing views into the history of Scottish royalty because of its super well looked-after buildings and cool displays. You, like your family, could uncover the Wallace Monument, commemorating Scottish hero William Wallace, so nearby, too it’s almost too simple. Mixed together, these spots turn into an epic half-day adventure bubbling with Scottish tradition.
South Queensferry is likely just the ticket if scenic coasts grab you. Very nearby Edinburgh by car, this delightful village offers some grandstand seats looking at the Forth Bridge and the waterways dotted all around. Have a stroll on the waterfront, taste local fish at places to eat. You, like your friends, could possibly even hop on a boat for a peek at Inchcolm Island which, I guess, shows off a seriously good-condition abbey.
Another prime candidate for a half-day jolly around Edinburgh, so it seems, is the gorgeous Scottish Borders; Melrose Abbey, more precisely. This awesome ruin, built back in the 1100s, really brings home some fancy stonework coupled with some fascinating tales. Wrapped by gorgeous fields, the abbey seems grand for taking easy walks. You could perhaps peep around the amazing wee town of Melrose, known, I think, for its adorable shops and cafés.
You are likely to discover Linlithgow highly worthwhile! Loads of Scottish monarchs came into the world in its superb Linlithgow Palace, one of its claims to fame. A calming wander is made oh-so simple, very much because a lovely loch almost cuddles the palace. Loaded with stores and places to chow down, Linlithgow town alone gives a friendly spot to loosen up in, actually appreciating its character. Anyone landing here, should call in at Linlithgow railway station as Edinburgh is pretty handy that way.
Scotland’s pureness, past experiences, or culture might just show off what these first-rate half day trips from Edinburgh mean to those shy on spare time. Destinations have unique snapshots from inside Scotland that include the wonderful Highlands, or olden Stirling Castle or sweet-as-pie hamlets local to this great city. Bag-packing plus photos at the ready and it, it sounds just about time for people out of Edinburgh be discovering fantastic vistas.
Outdoor exploration hits a high through spring into summer; however changing leaf settings are extremely picturesque if seen over autumn-esque weather.
Most sites appear reachable thru public options like train travels, buses along with charted round travels. These may just come together well during quick timelines.
Quick excursions nearby could sum up as two locale stop offs throughout single half sun cycle of span in journey’s length; preferably narrow sights may have guests experience fullest joy thru focusing attention specifically one site tops!

Upon my first meal in Edinburgh, I noticed many cultural differences between the dining experience in the U.S. versus that in the U.K. We’re not talking about the food here, we’re talking about the overall atmosphere of a Scottish pub.
The dialect between Americans and Scots is very different. In both countries, the server’s job is to come up to the tables and ask if they can get you drinks or food yet, or if you need more time to decide what you’d like. At The Abbey Pub, I overheard a table with Scotts, and they had cut off the server’s spiel, by saying, “I know what I want.” In America, it would be considered rude to cut off someone’s sentence. We treat servers with more respect by waiting for them to finish speaking, then responding with, “We know what we would like!” or “I think we are ready.”
The second difference in dining etiquette is the volume at which you speak. While restaurants can be loud in America, typically, all the tables’ voices mesh and it’s just overall chatter. In a Scottish pub, some tables are quiet, and some that the Scotts are speaking very loudly, and using very intense language.
(Photo sourced from Tripadvisor.com).
In The Abbey, there was a table near us of what appeared to be four Scotts or two couples. The women…

I was in the amazing Edinburgh Royal Botanic Gardens in April admiring the newly emerging spring daffodils when I had an epiphany, trees do in fact go to heaven, who knew!
A proponent of the daffodil is the end of life charity, Marie Curie who adopted it as their logo in 1986 offering hope, courage and support to all those who are touched by them. They started life delivering radiotherapy to women in the 30s.
She wore her yellow sun-bonnet,
She wore her greenest gown;
She turned to the south wind
And curtsied up and down.
She turned to the sunlight
And shook her yellow head,
And whispered to her neighbour:
“Winter is dead.”
Daffodowndilly, a poem by A.A. Milne
The first yellow daffodils of spring are a precious time of year for me. As A.A. Milne rightly points out they signify the end of a cold, black and white winter, a chance to wave goodbye to bad weather and offer a sense of timely rebirth with hope and a new beginning for the upcoming year.
Their arrival, a perennial gift from nature with their much-needed boost of colour is all I need from a faith, a non-spiritual conviction for me that never seems to disappoint, yellow on yellow, year on year and with impeccable timing! An unlikely yellow antidote to death, dying and goodbye!
The plant’s ‘bulbus’ (Latin) has a layer of dried skin, which serves as protection, and helps ensure that the bulb remain moist and properly insulated. There’s also another important function that it serves. Not only does this layer serve as a defence for this year’s plant, but it also carries the embryo for the plant or flower that’s going to bloom the following year.
Understanding that different kinds of daffodils follow their own pace is important. Growth primarily depends on the temperature of the soil as well as the amount of daylight that the plant receives and therefore the length of the day. Up here in Scotland we wait a month or more longer than in London where I grew up, for their arrival.
In the northern hemisphere they flower in spring and down in the southern hemisphere in our autumn, their spring. It’s magical stuff!
The daffodil plant generally thrives when the temperatures in the soil are between 50/60 degrees. As the sun begins to spend more time in the sky and the days begin to lengthen, the plant starts to grow more quickly.
Brodie Castle on the Moray Firth is one of the best places to see daffodils. They have a world-famous collection of well over 300 varieties and these always flower very late and are often at their best in late April and early May. I always enjoy a trip over to Brodie, located between Forres and Nairn just to see this yellow carnival at one of the National Trust for Scotland’s best kept secrets. Some varieties are around 150 years old like my favourite one above.
Another amazing display of yellow occurs around the same time, although with climate change it does flower from time to time all year-round, is from gorse.
Otherwise known as Whin and Furse and also Fuzzy Bush it starts its major flowering in late March and April and lasts here well into June. The overt coconut smell when in full bloom on a warm day is a very recognisable scent, one that you can also cook with if you flavour a dish with the flower petals.
It really is a ubiquitous, invasive plant in Northern Scotland especially by the coast and according to BBC’s Spring Watch; whom I tweeted this question last year, it flowers at odd times all year round simply to benefit from any early pollinators that are hanging around, out of season, who knew?
It also importantly has its own flower fairy:
When gorse is out of blossom,
(Its prickles bare of gold)
‘Then kissing’s out of fashion’,
Said country-folk of old.
Now Gorse is in its glory
In May when skies are blue,
But when its time is over,
Whatever shall we do?
O dreary would the world be,
With everyone grown cold —
Forlorn as prickly bushes
Without their fairy gold!
But this will never happen:
At every time of year
You’ll find one bit of blossom —
A kiss from someone dear!
The ‘Gorse Fairy’ is one of Cicely Mary Barker’s flower fairies that were first published in 1923.There are 170 original and individually accurate botanic illustrations, coupled with charming fairy images based on real children from Cicely’s sister’s nursery school. Each one also has a unique poem attached as above. The picture shown is on my wall at home, the verse in my book!
If you play golf on any of the world-famous links courses here, the ones played by the sea on the sand dunes and your ball lands in a gorse bush, you will have another, unmentionable name for this plant. As a rule of thumb and one which sadly missed gold commentator Peter Allis once advised, if you actually find it, take it out, drop it under penalty and ‘take your punishment son’. Never try to play it, you will regret it!
As with the daffodils, how these plants work out when to flower, never ceases to amaze me. Other yellow spring coastal gifts here are bird-foot trefoil, broom (often confused with gorse but safer!), aconites and the common dandelion.
The after-life of a tree
While once again in the Edinburgh Botanic Garden I also came across the following sign explaining how old trees that die do in fact have an ‘after-life’ or go to ‘tree heaven’ if you like. This very old sweet chestnut started to die back a few years ago and so the plant undertakers at Inverleith cut it down and left some of the main trunk in situ and the large boughs on the ground providing a habitat for other life such as bats, insects and birds.
However, this tree has suddenly lifted the lid on its coffin and surprisingly this spring, some new shoots and leaves have appeared. You can’t it seems keep a good tree down and yet another great example of nature providing hope and rebirth for the future despite looking death full in the face.
A.A. Milne — Writer and Poet
Alan Alexander Milne (1882 –1956) was a British author, poet, and playwright best known for his books about the bear Winnie-the-Pooh along with Christopher Robin, Tigger, Piglet and others. Christopher Robin was actually his son and who after a trip to the Zoo in London Milne wrote the original Winnie the Pooh story based on a tame bear, that they saw there named Winnipeg.
Milne was primarily a playwright before the massive success of Winnie-the-Pooh largely overshadowed all his previous work. Milne served in both World Wars, as a lieutenant in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment in the First World War and as a captain in the Home Guard in the Second World War. despite being a pacifist. He oddly had a degree in Maths whereby Trinity College, Cambridge, was his alma mater and was a useful cricketer. He bequeathed his original Pooh writings to the college.
Based on the fact that many of Milne’s philosophical sayings, poems and Winnie-the-Pooh quotes are often recited at funerals which I’ll come to later, he too saw the arrival of daffodils as a new beginning as per his poem at the start of this blog, added to the fact he was overtly a pacifist it seems that he did not speak out much on the subject of religion at all.
He did however, use religious terms to explain his decision, while remaining a pacifist, to join the Home Guard: ‘In fighting Hitler we are truly fighting the Devil, the Anti-Christ … Hitler was a crusader against God’
His best-known comment on the subject was remembered on his death:
The Old Testament is responsible for more atheism, agnosticism, disbelief — call it what you will — than any book ever written; it has emptied more churches than all the counter-attractions of cinema, motor bicycle and golf course.
He also wrote in the poem ‘Explained’:
Elizabeth Ann
Said to her Nan:
Please will you tell me how God began?
Somebody must have made Him.
So who could it be, ‘cos I want to know?
So, it seems that Milne was probably agnostic and veering on a non-believer but one who following a pretty religious upbringing in the late nineteenth century found it hard to completely let go as it was in those days and explaining that out loud, even harder.
It’s still difficult for me to tell my mother that I am an atheist and have been for many years following a similar childhood, where she is quite in disbelief and overtly saddened by my views.
Anyway, this blog is about the rebirth that nature brings us each year and one that is quite independent of any otherworldly beliefs and one that the ‘Scottish Enlightenment’ here began to address in the mid-eighteenth century questioning religion and allowing freedom of debate on subjects such as art, politics, science, medicine, engineering and especially philosophy that was, in those days difficult to contemplate in public.
That blog is here if you want to read it: Money can’t buy love, as the Beatles once suggested but it can buy a better death. However, contemplating ‘assisted-dying’ might well become part of a new ‘Scottish Enlightenment’ very soon!
https://medium.com/@DuncanHynd/money-cant-buy-love-as-the-beatles-once-suggested-but-it-can-buy-a-better-death-202150c6d2db
So yes, I definitely do firmly believe in yellow these days!
However, with a nod to the divine, it seems that Hindus see yellow as the colour of knowledge and learning. Lord Vishnu’s dress is yellow symbolizing his representation of knowledge.
Lord Krishna and Ganesha also wear yellow dresses while both Christians and Hindus associate yellow, seen as the colour of fire with renewal and purity and so while not the same, seemingly not a million miles away from my amateur philosophy above!
Winnie-the-Pooh
Milne’s bear was so much more than the famous animated hero of our childhoods and one that many Disney cartoons later featured. He and his friends were very much into philosophy with Milne using the characters to express many of his own beliefs. You probably wouldn’t have thought about using Pooh bear to find quotes about death, dying or saying goodbye to someone you love and so I have selected a few here that are in line with this article, secular in nature.
Death:
‘If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day, so I never have to live without you.’
‘If ever there is tomorrow when we’re not together, there is something you must always remember. You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think. But the most important thing is, even if we’re apart… I’ll always be with you.’
‘Wherever they go, and whatever happens to them on the way, in that enchanted place on the top of the forest, a little boy and his bear will always be playing.’
‘I used to believe in forever, but forever’s too good to be true.’
Life:
‘Some people care too much. I think it’s called love.’
‘How do you spell love?’ said Piglet, ‘You don’t spell it, you feel it, said Pooh
‘Rivers know this, there is no hurry. We shall get there some day.’
‘Sometimes,’ said Pooh, ‘the smallest things take up the most room in your heart’
Goodbye:
‘How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.’
‘But, of course, it isn’t really good-bye, because the forest will always be there… and anybody who is friendly with bears can find it.’
Airbnb offers a new feature when booking holidays, one where a death has occurred of a famous person at some time in the past!
In his writing prime, A.A. Milne lived at Cotchford Farm in Hartfield, East Sussex, the house, gardens and surrounding woods and country side inspired his children’s books. However, it is now available as a holiday let on Airbnb, but that is not the whole story!
The large country house has gained notoriety as it was also the home of Rolling Stones original member Brian Jones, who was found dead in the outdoor swimming pool in 1969, his death officially recorded as ‘misadventure’.
Around the grounds it is said that there are statues of the main characters in Milne’s books and poems, including Christopher Robin, Owl and an old sundial with images of Piglet, Tigger and Roo that also features words such as, ‘This warm, sunny spot belongs to Pooh, and here he wonders what it’s time to do’.
The Airbnb listing stated that you can ‘stay in the former home of A.A. Milne, Christopher Robin and Winnie The Pooh’ while mentioning that the property was a welcoming family home and historic building while Brian Jones was among other owners since the Milne family had it.
Some pictures located in the house have seemingly documented the chaos associated with the finding of Jones’s body in the pool and others showed Jones standing with the statues. It also seems that Christopher Robin, was not a great fan of being included in his father’s books and they sadly went their separate ways before Milne died there in 1956. An ill-fated property perhaps?
The Marie Curie charity began by delivering radiotherapy to women in 1930, who knew! They use the daffodil as the icon for their amazing end of lifecare charity for a reason.
This charity is the leading one in the UK that deals with dying, death and goodbye but it had roots in a subject close to my heart.
The Marie Curie charity really started life at the Marie Curie Hospital in Hampstead, London in 1930 where the ‘radiological treatment of women suffering from cancer and allied diseases’ was undertaken in what was a very early, specialist radiotherapy centre. Staffed only by women it had facilities for both radium and x-ray therapy with in and out-patient facilities. Amazingly in 1944, most of the hospital was razed to the ground in the blitz whereby their radium radioactive sources, safely stored in steel containers took, it seems three weeks to find in the rubble, probably much to the relief of the local RPA, if indeed they had one in those days!
In 1948 the rebuilt hospital parted ways from the newly born NHS, which Bevan had famously described as a ‘great and novel undertaking’ so that the name of Marie Curie could be established in the charitable medical field. Known initially as the ‘Marie Curie International Memorial Foundation’ it primarily investigated the needs of cancer patients and the best ways of helping them.
The first Marie Curie Home for cancer patients was opened in 1952, based in an old National Trust property in Fife while during the 1950s and early 1960s, the charity opened a further nine Marie Curie Homes in specially adapted but old buildings all over the UK while the charity’s main remit was to help cancer patients who needed nursing directly at home. Another aim was to make a substantial contribution to cancer research, especially into its causes and treatments.
From the 1960s onwards all Marie Curie Homes would be specially designed and newly built. The first was opened in Belfast in 1965. A similar, larger building followed in Edinburgh in 1966.
Their 24/7, day and night nursing service for cancer patients continued to grow throughout the 1960s while further specialist, dedicated laboratories opened for cancer research work.
From the early 1980s, ‘Marie Curie Homes’ and later the newly named ‘Marie Curie Hospices’ moved away from providing long-term nursing care to cancer patients, and became increasingly focused on hospice care, a field that they are now renowned for world-wide with the ability to offer palliative care for more patients, who were more seriously ill and usually for shorter periods of time.
The link to daffodils began in Scotland in 1986 in what was termed their first ‘daffodil appeal’ using live daffodils as a hand out similar to the poppy appeal. This continued to grow throughout the 1990s when they incorporated the daffodil into their logo, where it remains today.
They developed innovative fundraising partnerships with major companies and opened their first high street charity shops while in 1995, the Marie Curie Memorial Foundation became Marie Curie Cancer Care.
They launched their first national campaign called ‘supporting the choice to die at home’ and diversified to allow for the treatment of all terminal illnesses and not a charity just aimed at cancer patients. They successfully helped more terminally ill people remain in their homes, reducing the need for emergency hospital treatment, allowing more people to die at home and saving the NHS money.
Research efforts were focused on finding better ways of caring for terminally ill people and their families through palliative care research programs while establishing a major grants programme, awarding around £1 million every year to fund palliative care research projects, on a competitive basis becoming one of the UK’s leading funders of palliative care research.
In October 2014, the name was reduced to simply ‘Marie Curie’, to reflect the work to support people affected by all terminal illnesses.
Their main focus today is to assist people to make the right plans and preparations and to find the information and support they need when confronted with dying themselves or for family and friends facing bereavement. This includes prioritising social inclusion as some communities they have discovered get disproportionately less support than others at the end of life.
The Marie Curie Policy
‘We’re determined to fight for a world where everyone gets the best experience they possibly can at the end of their lives’.
Their ‘Better end of life’ report is here if you want to find out more on this amazing charity:
https://www.mariecurie.org.uk/policy/better-end-of-life-2022
And then the swallows return, the bluebells come out and we move on again!
PS. I wanted to add a section on music, an important part of my own life and am aware of the use of yellow in a few well-known hits, The Beatles and Coldplay come to mind. However, just as I write this latest piece, UK rapper ‘Big Zuu’ who also doubles as a brilliant ‘pop-up’ celebrity chef on TV has released his new song, its’ simply called Yellow! It’s great, shows off his musical talent in a different light and so I simply had to include it!

Hello from the world I’m embroiled in, where I’m way deeper than knee-deep in developing a new long-term unrestricted £15m pooled fund that shifts power to local people to make decisions on a cohort of community orgs in Edinburgh to lead place-based systems change across some big themes - poverty, racial inequality and injustice and climate change (phew — and yes I do have a bad habit of long sentences!).
Last week I wrote an update and thanks to our amazing learning groups as we come to the end of this chapter of co-design. I also have shared this with a group of people who have been advising, following along, supporting and cheering on.
Reminder that our learning groups have been a mix of individuals via End Poverty Edinburgh, community organisations, and funders and public sector partners — if you’d like to read more here is a blog that talks about this.
After I sent that I thought… I have an almost ready-made blog here.
So here is the (slightly edited) April 2024 update on Regenerative Futures Fund:
From March 2024 we have moved into a new phase of the project which means bringing the learning groups as they have been since the late 2022 / early 2023, to a close.
In March 2024 we created a condensed version of the detailed operational plan, which can be accessed here on the EVOC website.
We are also hoping to do an open Q&A session for community organisations in Edinburgh soon.
A few updates (and thanks!):
As ever, keen to chat with anyone who would like to meet to talk any aspect through, you’d like to get involved. Amazingly, there is SO much more to share than what’s in this update (I’ve missed so many things, it probably needs another blog!) — but I’m always to happy to chat over anything here and missing bits.
An information / conversation session coming soon — for Edinburgh community orgs.
And our ‘funders progressing proposals’ group has been meeting regularly since January if anyone from funding orgs would like to know more about that in terms of joining as a funding partner by contributing to the pooled fund.
Phew!
Finally — In 2023 I set myself a challenge to do 42 swims in my 42nd year and happy to report I am on track although I will be in the sea 4 times between now and next Saturday! Happy to have achieved a wee personal goal alongside a busy work year, and look forward to more swims in my 43rd year and beyond. Here is a pic of my favourite local swimming spot in early April ❤️
Please do email me on leah.black@evoc.org.uk or find me on LinkedIn (that’s where things seem to be happening now) if you’d like to chat 😁

3/4/2024
As decentralization becomes a central theme within the blockchain community, there’s an increasing recognition of the need to systematically evaluate the levels of decentralization within blockchain networks. In response to this need, the University of Edinburgh has spearheaded the creation of the Edinburgh Decentralization Index (EDI). This initiative aims to provide a detailed and open-source framework for evaluating blockchain networks, highlighting the industry’s shift towards distributed ecosystems and emphasizing the critical need for transparency and standardization in blockchain assessments.
On March 1st, 2024, the unveiling of the EDI Dashboard’s alpha version represented a significant step forward in blockchain transparency. Spearheaded by the University of Edinburgh and funded by a grant from Input Output Global (IOG), this open-source index was a result of a collaborative effort with multiple universities. By pooling their diverse academic insights and technical expertise, the partnership aimed to ensure the tool’s relevance and adaptability across different blockchain contexts.
The Decentralization Index is crafted to be objective and unbiased, with the aim of developing into an industry-wide accepted benchmark for assessing decentralization as it progresses over time.
The Edinburgh Decentralization Index (EDI) employs a variety of metrics to evaluate the decentralization levels of Layer 1 blockchains, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, Ethereum, Litecoin, Tezos, and Zcash. Understanding these metrics can help stakeholders assess the robustness and fairness of different blockchain networks.
Nakamoto Coefficient: This metric indicates the minimum number of entities required to control over 50% of mining or staking power, thus highlighting potential vulnerabilities in the network’s decentralization. A higher Nakamoto Coefficient suggests a more resilient and distributed network, making it a crucial measure for assessing security against collusion or attacks.
Gini Coefficient: By measuring the inequality within the distribution of block production, the Gini coefficient helps identify the balance of power within the network. A lower Gini coefficient indicates a more equitable distribution, which is essential for ensuring that no single entity has disproportionate control or influence over the network.
Shannon Entropy: This measure of information entropy quantifies the unpredictability and diversity of block producers. Higher Shannon entropy suggests a more decentralized network, reflecting a varied and unpredictable block production that enhances network security and fairness.
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI): The HHI measures market concentration to evaluate the diversity of block producers. Low HHI values denote a decentralized network with a balanced distribution of power among participants, which is vital for preventing dominance by any single entity.
Theil Index: This index measures the redundancy in a population, with lower values indicating a more equal distribution of block production. By assessing the diversity of participation in the network, the Theil index provides insights into the network’s decentralization and operational fairness.
Max Power Ratio: Representing the proportion of blocks produced by the most dominant entity, this metric sheds light on the extent of control exerted by the largest block producer. A lower max power ratio is preferable for a healthy, decentralized ecosystem, ensuring no single participant overly influences the network.
Tau-Decentralization Index: This index measures the concentration of power by identifying the minimum number of entities controlling more than a specific fraction (e.g., 66%) of mining or staking power. It offers a nuanced view of network control, essential for understanding deeper layers of decentralization beyond the majority control.
These metrics collectively offer a multi-dimensional view of blockchain decentralization, providing valuable insights for users, developers, and regulators to understand and improve the distributed ecosystems of various blockchains.
The Edinburgh Decentralization Index (EDI) aims to reshape the blockchain landscape by providing a standardized approach to evaluating decentralization. This could significantly impact the future of blockchain technology, potentially paving the way for widespread adoption. As businesses, institutions, and nation-states begin utilizing blockchains for various purposes like identity management, payment systems, and governance, it could lead to increased adoption of blockchain technologies across both public and private sectors. This, in turn, would drive innovation and enhance efficiency.
By offering clear metrics for decentralization, the EDI facilitates more informed decisions by governments and organizations. For instance, a country might choose to adopt a blockchain like Cardano for its stablecoin initiative. Such applications could enhance public trust in blockchain and stimulate broader usage across various sectors.
Furthermore, with the EDI placing decentralization at the forefront, current and future blockchain systems are likely to be encouraged to become more decentralized and incorporate features such as on-chain governance. This emphasis on decentralization could lead to increased adoption of blockchain technologies for both public and private applications, thereby driving innovation and efficiency.
As the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry focuses more on decentralization in the future, the development of the Edinburgh Decentralization Index (EDI) by the University of Edinburgh will play a crucial role and lay the foundation for future metrics by which blockchains are measured. Moving forward, with the EDI emphasizing decentralization, it will be poised to encourage the adoption of more decentralized approaches within blockchain systems, fostering innovation and efficiency across both public and private applications.

A week’s adventure loop from Edinburgh
Venturing out on a cycle tour in August 2020 as Scotland gradually emerges from the coronavirus lockdown was a complicated decision, fraught with factors we’d never had to consider on bicycle trips before. First the question of whether we should even leave home for a week, and add our needs for accommodation, food, and facilities to the burden placed on other towns. Then, whether we could manage proper handwashing and social distancing from the saddle. And not least, if we were to encounter any injuries or difficulties along the way, could we manage that ourselves without putting others at risk?
The choice to travel during a pandemic is an individual one, based on personal circumstances, capacities, and acceptance of risk. We were certain we didn’t want to board a train or a plane unnecessarily, but a self-supported bicycle camping trip seemed a reasonable form of recreation, and although we planned to be away for a week we were never more than 60 miles away from home in case we needed to return quickly. We packed our face coverings, hand sanitiser, puncture repair tools, and first-aid kit; counted ourselves extremely fortunate to be in good health with time off from work; and hit the road.
Day 1 encompassed 40 miles from Edinburgh down to Innerleithen, following the brilliant National Cycle Network Route 1 along traffic-free paths and quiet roads out of the city, over the Moorfoot Hills and down into a beautiful valley beside the Leithen Water. It was a hot, pre-thunderstorm day and our legs were decidedly unused to hills after being inside for months, but it was still a joyful experience to finally be released from the cramped confines of the city and be flying along on two wheels.
In Innerleithen we visited with friends, and the next morning had a lovely breakfast outdoors at the Café Sitooterie.
Notes on the route: brilliant off-road cycle paths (converted from former railway lines so mostly flat) all the way from Edinburgh to Bonnyrigg. From Bonnyrigg the route is on-road on minor B roads with little traffic. No villages or services for 20 miles until Innerleithen; we picked up sandwiches and snacks at the Bonnyrigg Co-op.
Day 2 took us from Innerleithen down to the Ruberslaw Wild Woods Camping site a few miles from Denholm. We followed NCN Route 1 along a gorgeous riverside path and through quiet woods, rolling up and down hills to Melrose. Melrose is a lovely town with an historic Abbey (one of the stops on the Four Abbeys local cycle loop) but it was closed under coronavirus restrictions. The town itself was quite busy so we stopped at another Co-op to buy some bagels and peanut butter (by now our classic bike touring lunch menu) along with groceries for a camp dinner, and had a picnic in Gibson Park.
Notes on the route: between Caddonfoot and Tweedbank the NCN slips off the road and down a tiny dirt path next to the river, well-hidden by trees and bushes. We missed the sign and instead turned right across a newly-surfaced cycling and pedestrian bridge — which was fabulous infrastructure, even if it was the wrong direction (for us). Although NCN 1 follows the river most of the way to Newtown St Boswells, it’s not flat; we tackled about 1,000 feet of elevation gain including a good climb out of Melrose.
From Melrose we cycled on to Newtown St Boswells, where we had to leave the NCN and scout our own route south to Denholm. Navigation was a bit tricky since many of the minor roads were unsigned, but we wound our way through the countryside and arrived at the campsite around 6:30pm. We’d been lucky to get a booking in advance, since so many campsites are fully booked for weeks due to high demand. Ruberslaw is a well-run and pretty fancy campsite, with a central Hub with showers, phone charging and Wifi, and a shared open-air kitchen with a microwave and electric tea kettle! We’d opted to camp in one of their forest pitches, so after checking in we had to hike-a-bike up a grassy farm track to our spot in the woods.
Day 3 was a “rest” day. We were staying a second night at Ruberslaw but had to change sites since we hadn’t been able to book two nights in one spot. So we packed up camp and carried our gear with us 8 miles to Hawick (pronounced “Hoyk”) which was the closest town with a grocery store. As always seems to be the case, avoiding the main roads usually at least doubles the climbing, so it turned out to be a fairly strenuous “rest day” ride. In Hawick we had lunch outside at the Damascus Drum cafe and picked up some food to cook in camp before cycling 8 miles back (this time on a flatter route).
Day 4 brought 1,200 feet of elevation gain on foot, and another 1,600 feet on bikes. We spent the morning climbing Ruberslaw itself (“law” being a common word in Scotland for a hill, from the Anglo-Saxon word hlāw). The thunderstorms had finally broken overnight, so we left our wet tent to dry out a bit and hiked through the mist and purple heather up to the summit.
We left camp around 12pm and cycled on minor roads through Jedburgh up to Kelso. The rain caught up with us as we arrived in Kelso, notable for having a cobbled square with all cobbled roads leading into it —this is quite the experience on bikes (I call it the Cobble Wobble). All the cafes were closed and we were contemplating soggy takeaway sandwiches from Greggs until we happened to spot a nearby pub with a covered outdoor picnic table and made a dash for that just as the clouds burst open again. We tucked ourselves and our bikes under the awning and had an excellent lunch. (The name of the pub was, of course, The Cobbles — highly recommended).
We waited out the rain as long as we could then left Kelso looking for NCN Route 1 again (we missed the turn, but our alternate route on the back roads through Stichill and Leitholm was virtually traffic-free and mostly flat). The rain came down hard again for about 5 minutes, which was plenty of time to get us thoroughly drenched, even in our waterproof gear. Luckily we had 14 miles to dry out before we reached Swinton. We stayed overnight with some kind and covid-conscious Airbnb hosts who let us dry out our tent in their airing cupboard.
Notes on the route: after Jedburgh we turned north on the B6400 towards the tiny hamlet of Nisbet and then followed the Borders Abbeys Way for awhile. The section of the Borders Abbeys Way east from Nisbet is a rocky gravel track; for a paved road option go a bit further along the B6400 and take the next right.
Day 5, heading for the seaside! It was a short 17-mile ride from Swinton to Berwick-upon-Tweed in sunny weather. We cycled over the River Tweed and crossed the border from Scotland into England, then rejoined NCN 1 in Norham. We took a brief break in the shade and had a look round the Norham Castle ruins, then carried on, crossing over the 200-year-old Union Chain suspension bridge and following a separated cycle track briefly alongside the A1, then a bridleway over the hill into Berwick.
We set up camp at the Seaview Caravan Park on the outskirts of Berwick, and spent the rest of the sunny afternoon on the beach. (The Caravan Park was ok, not much accommodation for tents other than a small patch of lawn alongside the road, but lovely views and good facilities for toilets, showers, and washing-up sinks.)
Day 6, so long, sunshine. A thick fog rolled in overnight and beclouded the whole coast. We had a second night booked at the Caravan Park and had planned a day ride out and back to Lindisfarne National Nature Reserve and Holy Island, about 15 miles down the coast. Holy Island is connected to the mainland by a tidal causeway which is flooded by the sea twice a day, but the safe crossing window that day was between 12:10pm — 9:20pm so we had plenty of time. We followed NCN 1 all the way, which is a fantastic adventure over grassy clifftop paths (unpaved for most of the route). We were quite glad not to be hauling heavy panniers but met a few loaded touring cyclists who seemed to be having a great time. We intended to stop at the lone Londis shop near Beal for provisions, but instead came across the Barn at Beal Restaurant & Campsite so had coffee and very good sandwiches there instead.
Day 7 turned out to be our longest distance day, cycling 50 miles from Berwick-upon-Tweed to Yellowcraig Beach. We had takeaway breakfast rolls and coffee from the Mule on Rouge Cafe in Berwick, picked up some bread and cheese for lunch on the road, and cycled out on NCN 1, connecting to NCN 76 as we left town. NCN 76 was our route for most of the day; we left it briefly at Foulden to head inland and skipped the scenic loop to Eyemouth (saving those miles and hills for another day). We had lunch on the side of the road, picked wild blackberries, and rolled through the lovely town of Dunbar and then into North Berwick (not to be confused with Berwick-upon-Tweed).
Notes on the route: NCN 76 is mostly on-road, using quiet minor roads but with a 5-mile stretch on the A1107 from near Reston to Cocksburnpath. It’s a fast road but there weren’t many cars and drivers gave us plenty of space. After Bilsdean there’s a separated cycle way next to the A1 (crossing the A1 is required at one point, at a guided crossing) which takes you past Torness Nuclear Power Station. Not long after it’s a traffic-free path into Dunbar, and then it’s mostly on the John Muir Way (a mix of quiet roads, traffic-free paths, and grassy tracks) into North Berwick and on to Yellowcraig Beach.
After a short break in North Berwick we pedalled another 3 miles on to Yellowcraig Beach to wild camp for the night. There was a handful of other tents spaced out across the dunes when we arrived, and signs permitting responsible camping, so we waved hello to our distant camping neighbours, pitched our tent, and made macaroni cheese on the beach.
Day 8 was a straightforward journey from Yellowcraig Beach back home to Edinburgh, following a familiar route on the NCN 76. Glad to be back safely, and grateful for the dedicated folk at Sustrans who have built the fantastic National Cycle Network for everyone to travel along.
Total distance and elevation gain: 232 miles, 9,875 feet

During 2022 summer, I participated in a summer programme — student-led, individually-created course — in the University of Edinburgh. What this course about is students themselves design the course that they plan to study and use reflective framework to develop personal and professional skills throughout their learning process.
It is a good way to learn knowledge or skills outside of one’s major and with the guidance from the university, students are able to individually conduct reflective report regarding their study path — a meaningful assessment method on what students have learnt.
When I think about what I want to learn during the summer, a question popped out: what else can I create with the background of studying psychology?
It turns out that User Experience (UX) Design is an area connect tightly to psychology as it involves knowing users and solving their problems. Therefore, I decided to learn in more details how a UX designer conduct a project and what skills are required along the way.
The project that I choose to carry on is to solve a problem that I accidentally saw in the newspaper in which it talks about Nigeria’s stock market may need more than technology to thrive. Therefore, with the hope to have an accessible app for people with little investment knowledge to use, I decided to design an iOS app that can make users find it more easily to invest stocks online.
Project Showcase:
To have the prototypes like the picture showed above, I need to acquire several skills:
This programme requires two reflective reports to be submitted as a way of assessing students’ ability to self-trace what has been doing well and what can be improved.
To achieve a distinct grade, reports should show the writers’ reflection framework when reviewing their study processes. In particular, students’ critical reflection is important as it can shows that they are not only paying attention to what goes well but also taking into account areas that can be improved. For example, though I noticed that my learning process of using Figma is efficient in terms of time-management, the way I learn only relies on having my project done. If there is more self-exploration when learning to use Figma, my learning pathway can be more diverse.
Although in most of the time, this programme test people’s ability to self-study, each student is assigned to a tutor who will provide advice with how to improve their reflective ability.
Finally, I got an A with all the assessment being reviewed by my tutors. What this programme is about is not only the mark that I got, but truly teaches me the importance of learning process rather than the outcome.
Before enrolled in this programme, I rarely thought about what I want to do as my career. Although I am glad to being able to learn Psychology, there are so much choices that I can make to further my career.
With this programme experience, I decided to learn the UX design further and hope to being able to produce more projects that are useful for the real-world. Although I am lack of certain design skills, I believe this story told me that when one person decided to be the teacher and teach himself/herself, the power of learning is unbelievable.

I am a third year student at the University of Edinburgh studying Psychology. I am interested in UX Design and HCI in general.

on Edinburgh’s Royal Mile
St Giles High Kirkis celebrating its 900th birthday in style by getting some marvellous new lights installed. This really does cement its place on the Edinburgh skyline as the finest spire or sticky up bit (SOSUB) and I’d be prepared to roll up my sleeves and go bareknuckle with anyone who disagrees.
This long view shows the SOSUBS of (left to right) Edinburgh Castle, The Hub spire, then (in the background) the Scottish National War Memorial at the castle, St Giles crown spire, and The Tron Kirk spire.
You’re basically looking at a compressed Royal Mile squished into one frame with a 500mm lens.
The view from the street is pretty impressive too, especially when the haar rolls in from the North Sea and the beams of light continue into the sky. If only St Giles could work out a way to get £1 from everyone who takes a photo of the spire from the Royal Mile they could pay the leccy bill and a whole lot more.

The village of Glencoe, Scotland is known for its incredible hiking, nature and landscape. However, if you fly into Edinburgh (as many tourists do) you will quickly realize that it, along with the rest of the highlands, are pretty hard to get to. Specifically, it takes around 3 hours to get to Glencoe by car and almost 4.5 hours via public transport. Renting a car is expensive and taking public transport restricts your schedule to that of trains and buses.
On my recent trip to Edinburgh I faced this conundrum — I really wanted to do a day hike, however, I did not want to deal with renting a car and driving all the way to the highlands. This is when I discovered The Pentlands. A hilly nature preserve located just 20 minutes from Edinburgh city center, these hills (or maybe even mini-mountains) are perfect for a day hike without much planning. If you want incredible views of Edinburgh along with the surrounding Scottish countryside The Pentlands are a great option.
While I am definitely not the resident expert on The Pentlands or other hikes near Edinburgh, I want to provide a guide based on my own experience. The following guide is purely anecdotal and illustrates steps that are specific to my travel style. That being said, hopefully it is still helpful in some way. I really did not see many guides on hiking the Pentlands available online when I was looking to get there — hopefully this clarifies some things!
While staying in Edinburgh I tried to research the closest entrance point to the park from the city. I found that Midlothian Snowsports Centre in Hillend provides a more lowkey trail entrance. If you’re staying in Edinburgh city center this entrance is only 23 minutes by car and at the time of my trip cost me only 10£ by Uber. If you’re looking for an even cheaper option the number 15 bus line to Easter Brush stops directly at the Snowsports Center and runs fairly frequently from Princes Street in the center of the city. Either option is great, just make sure you have a plan to get back into the city after your hike (I will talk more about this later)!
So when I finally got to Midlothian Snowsports Centre I was pretty confused on how to actually get into The Pentlands. After some searching I spoke with the desk clerk at the Snowsports center and made my way over to the right of the building. Up that direction is a very inconspicious trail head gently sloping upwards into the park itself. While its very easy to miss, its totally worth the climb! Below is an annotated map depicting the entrance, as you can see its to the right and very lowkey.
As you can probably see in the photo above, the entrance trail was nothing more than a dirt road running up into the rolling Scottish hills — perfect! Its worth noting that this entrance path splits into two options: one steeper and one more gradual, both incline to the top of Caerketton Hill (in the background horizon of the photo). I really enjoyed this part of the hike, the view just kept getting better and better.
Now i’d be lying if I said this was an easy uphill walk. While I did take the steeper path, i’d definitely be prepared for a workout! The view are really super worth it — you can slowly see all of Edinburgh spread out below you.
Honestly pictures don’t do it justice. At Caerketton Hill peak you can see the vast majority of The Pentlands sprawled out ahead of you. To get to the top of Caerketton Hill it definitely takes ~30 minutes, which really isn’t bad if you want some incredible views of the city and the rest of the park. If you’re like me and need a few hours of walking to be satisfied you can continue to follow the trail deeper and deeper into the Scottish countryside; however, if you’re done you can just as easily turn back to the snow center and get a beer in the city.
Here’s the view facing away from Edinburgh (and deeper into the park itself). You can totally see the long sprawling trails the seem to go on forever. You can also see some pretty cool sheep that I tried to pet, but they were clearly not interested.
Now above is route that I took through the park. Overall I highly recommend planning your exit strategy ahead of time. In general I found that this route was a perfect mix for adventure/direction for me. The majority kept me on trails climbing and descending the rolling hill, while the end added a bit of spontaneity to my journey.
What do I mean by spontaneity? Well, I did not exactly plan my trip back into Edinburgh. This got me stuck crossing private fields and a military base to actually make it back to the main road (A702). While the views were still awesome (see below), I only recommend it if you’re up for an adventure. If you want a more legit route you can easily circle backwards to the snowcenter or continue further on.
There really aren’t any towns along A702 in the location that this spit me out at. Because of this, I recommend bringing a phone with plenty of charge to call an Uber back into the city. My phone was dead at this point and I ended up hitchhiking back to the nearest metro station.
Overall I think my entire hike took ~4.5 hours so I was able to leave around 9:30 am and be back just in time for lunch. Not bad for less than a 30 minute ride. Next time I go to Scottland, I really hope to checkout the Highlands, however, if you’re limited on time (like I was) I recommend checking out The Pentlands! If you made it here, thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed my story/guide.

At the end of May, I spent some time in Edinburgh exploring different parts of Scottish history. During my days in the city, I visited three places:
So, here is everything I wanted to share from my trip, starting with Mary King’s Close.
Mary King’s Close
Mary King’s Close was a real close in Edinburgh until the Edinburgh City Chambers Building was built on top of it between 1753–1761. They did this by removing the top floors from the houses and built the foundations on the lower floors, so the close is underground, but when it was a residential area, it wouldn’t have been. The last resident was called Andrew Chesney, a saw maker. He lived with his wife Margaret until 1897, when they were forced to move due to the Royal Exchange buying the area for extension purposes. However, Chesney was still able to work on the Close. Then in 2003, the public were able to go on guided tours around the close after Continuum Attractions opened The Real Mary King’s Close.
The close’s name was taken from a resident of the close: Mary King, who lived in the close from 1635 (when it was documented that she was a resident) until her death in…

One of the things I do when visiting a place I’ve never been is look at the real estate for sale. As a retired real property attorney from the U.S. who has a passion for real estate, it’s just something that I do. If I’m really into the city, I will check out neighborhoods and look into what is available in the areas I find.
That is how I learned about Dean Village. It’s a tourist destination, a popular place, I learned on Instagram. The photos below will show you why. For me, it was simply adjacent to a neighborhood with apartments that looked like somewhere I would live. Given several places to check out, we started from Marchmont and headed to the Village.
We discovered the Water of Leith Walkway once we crossed the bridge in Dean Village, trying to find a shortcut to an apartment I wanted to see. There were few tourists on the path, and we found a calm, relaxed place to enjoy in the city’s heart.
I could live here. (No, we didn’t look inside nor at the price.)
We strolled the city over the next few days and found a bookstore, other pubs, and city art that we liked. The bookstore appealed to me for its proclamation and selection of books that most stores don’t bother carrying.
I needed food at that moment, and this pub had good food. I learned that most pubs in Scotland do not serve food-they are only bars. This is different from London, where we’d just been.
Ah, another book. Well, I’m a writer. What do you expect?
Will I return? I already have plans. The landlord will challenge me to RUN up to Arthur’s Seat this time, I’m pretty sure.
For all the photos of Edinburgh, visit my website.

First, the poem: It’s called Edinburgh’s Hills
Once there was a town they called Dun Eidieann.It was built around a castle on a hill.The town grew south and east and west but not northBecause of what was at the bottom of the hill.
So they built an artificial lake out of that bottom.And then threw trash and even bodies down the hill.And Loch Nor soon became a sewer.So they drained the lake and built an artificial hill.
Then they went to work on building Georgian New TownAnd placed their monuments on Calton Hill.And then they thought they would extend the Glasgow railroad.So they tunneled through that artificial hill.
It took a million carts of dirt from New Town To build The Mound, that artificial hill.Then they built the National Gallery of ScotlandAnd planted shrubs and trees on their new hill.
Now people congregate at New Town’s GardensAnd gaze at the fort on Old Town’s hill.Then they walk the Royal Mile to the castleAnd look down at New Town from Castle Hill.
2. And now, the pictures:
We would leave our New Town hotel at Picardy Place every day and walk up Leith Street, passing two giraffes on our left and the St James Shopping Centre on the right.
Shops were closing in 2016 and the old shopping centre was about to be demolished while the new shopping centre was being constructed. It’s called St James Quarter now but back then its name was Edinburgh St James.
Sometimes we dawdled along Princes Street. At other times we just walked across North Bridge over Waverly train station to reach the Royal Mile in Old Town.
On the Royal Mile we examined the shops and the bars and the street performers.
The Royal Mile runs from Edinburgh Castle on the western top of the hill to Holyrood Palace at the eastern bottom. It’s pretty much a straight line on top of the ridge but the street names change from Castle Hill to Lawnmarket to High Street to Canongate.
One day we walked to the top of the Royal Mile and visited the Castle and the National War Museum of Scotland and admired the views of Princes Street and New Town.
On yet another day we visited the National Museum of Scotland in Old Town and then had lunch at the Elephant House nearby.
J.K. Rowling wrote most of her first Harry Potter novel at the Elephant House.
In the above photo, New Town’s Princes Street and the Scott Monument are on the left. In the background, the Balmoral Hotel is to the left of North Bridge and the buildings on the right are in Old Town. North Bridge connects to the Royal Mile about halfway between the Castle and the Palace.
Uh-oh, I think I am getting farther behind other writers involved in this challenge. I better get going on the letter F! But first I am going to check out the latest A-Z stories by Sam Millichap, Adrienne Beaumont, Michael Rhodes, Anne Bonfert, Jillian Amatt - Artistic Voyages, Robert G. Longpré, Nishan Fuard, and Darren Weir.

We visited Scotland in 2016, dividing our time between Edinburgh and Glasgow. When I mentioned our plans to my sister Betty, she recommended that I take a look at a series of novels about a wealthy woman named Isabel Dalhousie who lives in Edinburgh where she edits a magazine on ethics and on the side gathers her group of friends together, usually on Sundays, to solve murder mysteries. She calls her little group The Sunday Philosophy Club, which is the title of the first book in a series that has now reached 17.
The Isabel Dalhousie books are the product of a rather prolific writer named Alexander McCall Smith, a noted legal scholar who was born in Botswana (when it was called Rhodesia) and became an expert on medical law. McCall Smith moved to Edinburgh in the 1950s when he became a professor of medical law and bioethics at the University of Edinburgh. He decided to become a full-time writer in 2005 and he still produces three or four books a year. Some of them are children’s books, some are detective series (The № 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency, 44 Scotland Street and a few others), and some are academic textbooks. And he manages to crank out an Isabel Dalhousie mystery just about every year.
Edinburgh was once divided into two parts. We have the Old Town on the hill with Edinburgh Castle on the top and the Palace of Holyrood House on the bottom. In between is the Royal Mile where all the tourists hang out. University students, too. Then we have what is called New Town which is mostly north of Old Town and is mostly flat. New Town is almost as old as Old Town. Princes Street, the main street in New Town, is at the base of the Old Town hill and runs parallel to the Royal Mile. Modern Edinburgh has spread out in all directions from Old Town and New Town.
Isabel lives in Bruntsfield south of Edinburgh’s Old Town. We resided on the eastern edge of New Town during our week-long stay in Edinburgh. Every day we walked westward to Old Town and the Royal Mile. We never walked as far as Bruntsfield, though.
In The Sunday Philosophy Club, she attends a concert and witnesses a man falling to his death. The police say it was an accident. She thinks he was pushed. The Sunday group ponders over the matter, bringing up matters involving Immanuel Kant and other philosophers, and of course solve the mystery.
I only read four of the Isabel Dalhousie books, skipping # 4 through 12 and going right to # 13, which McCall had just completed prior to our trip in 2016. It is called Sweet, Thoughtful Valentine and is really just a short story and only available as an eBook. In this book Isabel ponders over a moral dilemma involving a promise she made to a friend. In typical McCall Smith fashion, she wanders to her favorite cafe on Dundas Street, then visits an antique shop and an auctioneer nearby where she meets an old friend and makes her promise. The two then ride on a bus back to Bruntsfield. The story continues with scenes involving Isabel’s niece Cat, and another friend who is also involved in the auction. We also breeze through scenes involving Isabel’s husband Jamie and their son Charlie. The climax occurs when Isabel returns to the auction house to attend the auction. No murders in this story.
Since 2016 McCall Smith has written four more books in the series. But I moved on to Spain shortly after returning home from Scotland and began reading memoirs by pilgrims on the Camino, preparing for our trip to Spain in 2017.
If I ever return to Scotland, I will probably devote some of my time to rereading some of my favorite works by Scottish authors Arthur Conan Doyle and Robert Louis Stevenson. Both had roots in Edinburgh, but Sherlock Holmes did most of his detective work in London and Stevenson’s children adventures featured Scottish heroes, but he concentrated on Europe, America and the South Seas for his travel books.
You can find more details about our trip to Edinburgh in my Crow Canyon Journal blog here, here, and here.

In contrast to my hometown of Glasgow which, said with total affection of course, can slightly give off a post-soviet energy, Edinburgh certainly looks like a capital city, as far as surface appearances go. Not only does it house Scotland’s arguably most important cultural site, Edinburgh Castle, but it’s unexpectedly a major financial epicentre; unexpectedly because it doesn’t feel like it at all. In a lot of ways, Edinburgh is more small town than big city. It’s important to note though, that this charming city of old is very clearly becoming one of the world’s major melting pots — attracting students & professionals from all corners of the world. Apparent in the recent addition of certain world-famous brands like The W Hotel to their roster of places to be. So, in the ever wise words of Miss Molly-Mae, we all have the same 24 hours— and so this is how I’d spend mine in the city of Edinburgh.
“In a lot of ways, Edinburgh is more small town than big city.”
Arriving at Waverley train station will put you slap-bang in the middle of Princes Street in the city’s New Town district. On your right will be the Balmoral Hotel housing the glorious Palm Court, in which they host Edinburgh’s (alleged) best afternoon tea.
One of many Harry Potter references in this city is that JK Rowling alleged she finished the Harry Potter series while staying in a suite in this hotel. She left a bust of Hermes in her room, upon which she inscribed “JK Rowling finished writing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in this room (552) on 11th Jan 2007” — and the room has since been known as the J.K. Rowling Suite. The bust still sits in the room, though now surrounded by a glass case. A far cry from the dribs & drabs of back-street coffee shops where it’s said she had written “parts” of the previous books in Edinburgh’s Old Town.
Speaking of Old Town, and starting with the most important meal of the day — is the city’s answer to Elan Cafe; a pink paradise just off of the city’s landmark “Royal Mile”, Laila’s. It is a brunch-y Middle Eastern fusion joint with proven classics like French Toast, and Levantine faves like shakshuka.
Edinburgh is a foodie’s paradise so a walk in between meals is a must, and there’s nowhere better than the Royal Mile, which runs between Edinburgh Castle & another notable historical site; Holyrood House. Just to be transparent, the distance isn’t exactly 1 mile but you’ll find plenty of cute jaunts along this stretch, selling traditional Scottish exports; cashmere, wool, whiskey, shortbread & tablet. My favourite is an all-year-round Christmas shop guarded by 2 nutcrackers — a great place to buy an Edinburgh-themed souvenir. Everything in Edinburgh is fairly walkable but there are hills & cobbled streets to look out for on this side of town — so sky-high Louboutins? Not a good idea.
If all that walking has made you a bit peckish, you’ll find every cuisine you can fathom in Edinburgh. However I don’t think you can go wrong with Steak Frites, and you’ll find the best at Chez Jules — 2 courses will only set you back £9.90 [yes, you read that correctly]. It speaks to the kindness & hospitality that Scottish folks are known for. Upon your entry, you’ll be given a variation of hors d’oeuvres, as if you were visiting the house of an old friend — which is exactly what Edinburgh feels like.
Another [personal] favourite is Taco Libre, “owned by Mexicans, cooked by Mexicans” — the perfect opportunity to support a POC-owned business, and again very reasonably priced, as are many venues due to the large cohort of students occupying the city during term-time.
Edinburgh, unsurprisingly, is not short of places to wet your whistle. A firm favourite for an afternoon pick-me-up is a spot tucked inside the Edinburgh Grand hotel on St Andrew Square — The Register Club. The walls are clad in wooden panelling and play to the “old world” glamour Edinburgh is loved for. I am admittedly quite bougie, so this is exactly my cup of tea. If you’re looking for something a little more lively, a stone’s throw away is Rose Street Garden, an unassuming spot & one of my favourite places to take friends visiting from outside Scotland. From here, if you’re a shopaholic you can hop along to George Street or the new St James Quarter; a one-stop-shop for everything you’d need for a day (or few) in Edinburgh; accommodation, eateries, shopping, entertainment, bars — you name it.
A defining quality of Edinburgh is the stark contrast between the different areas of the city. “Old Town” with its cobbled streets & “New Town” as a sort of cosmopolitan Mecca. Bruntsfield is a little out of the way & more residential but just as trendy, and super underrated — though I’d recommend this for a weekend rather than just 24 hours, but granted, you’ll be back. As well as a trip to the shoreside town of Queensferry. A short journey will make you feel like you’re in San Francisco [though I can’t guarantee the weather will match up] and it’s super easy to reach. Get on a 43 bus from outside the train station and keep your camera at the ready because you are not prepared for the sites on the journey.
Where Edinburgh doesn’t match up to certain qualities of other capital cities, it excels in others. The weather [usually] lacks, but the people here beam brighter than the sun. Perhaps I’m just a proud Scot, or maybe there’s something in the air. I suppose you won’t know until you see it for yourself.
Check out the full list of recommendation at the 24 hours in Edinburgh placelist below!

I’ve never set foot in Edinburgh, but somehow, it feels like I belong there. In my mind, I stroll down its cobblestone streets, surrounded by centuries of history. There’s something about the city’s ancient charm that draws me in, where the buildings, weathered by time, seem to echo stories of old money and aristocratic elegance. It’s a place where history feels alive, woven into the fabric of every corner.
I imagine cozy, rainy days spent in small cafés, much like where J.K. Rowling penned Harry Potter, sipping a cup of hot chocolate as the mist rolls in. The city has that romantic, almost cinematic quality – a place where you can lose yourself in a quiet bookshop, or watch the world go by from a window seat, feeling at peace.
Edinburgh feels like an escape from the chaos, where life moves at a slower pace and the people are warm, inviting. It’s a place of inspiration, where every stone, every hidden alley seems to have a story waiting to be told. Though I’ve never been there, the thought of it feels like home. One day, I’ll find my way to those rain-soaked streets, to the city that already holds a piece of my heart.

Perched majestically on Scotland’s eastern coast, Edinburgh is a city that seamlessly blends its rich history with vibrant culture and ever-changing weather. From its ancient roots to its modern-day charm, Edinburgh offers a captivating tapestry of experiences that enthrall visitors from around the world.
Edinburgh’s history is woven into the very fabric of its streets, buildings, and monuments. Dating back over a thousand years, the city has witnessed the rise and fall of kingdoms, triumphs, and tribulations of its people.
At the heart of Edinburgh stands its most iconic landmark, Edinburgh Castle. Perched atop Castle Rock, this ancient fortress has stood guard over the city for centuries, its towering walls holding the secrets of Scotland’s past within its stone embrace. From its beginnings as a royal residence to its role in countless battles and conflicts, Edinburgh Castle is a testament to the city’s storied history.
The Royal Mile, a cobbled street that stretches from the castle to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, is a living museum of Edinburgh’s past. Lined with centuries-old buildings, including the striking St. Giles’ Cathedral and the imposing Parliament Hall, the Royal Mile is a treasure trove of historic sites and hidden gems waiting to be discovered.
Edinburgh’s cultural scene is as diverse and dynamic as the city itself. From world-class museums and galleries to lively festivals and events, there is always something to see, do, and experience.
Every August, the city comes alive with the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the world’s largest arts festival. With thousands of performances ranging from theatre and comedy to music and dance, the Fringe showcases the best of international talent against the backdrop of Edinburgh’s historic streets.
But Edinburgh’s cultural offerings extend far beyond the August month. The city is home to a thriving music scene, with venues ranging from intimate pubs to grand concert halls hosting performances by local musicians and international acts alike. Art galleries, such as the Scottish National Gallery and the Fruitmarket Gallery, offer a glimpse into the world of Scottish and international art, while theaters like the Edinburgh Playhouse and the Traverse Theatre provide a stage for cutting-edge drama and entertainment.
One cannot speak of Edinburgh’s weather without mentioning its well-known unpredictability. Like its cultural offers, the city’s climate is diverse, ranging from intense sunshine to unexpected downpours.
Summer brings long days and mild temperatures, perfect for exploring Edinburgh’s outdoor attractions, such as Arthur’s Seat and the Royal Botanic Garden. Autumn paints the city in hues of gold and crimson, while winter transforms it into a winter wonderland, with the Christmas markets and Hogmanay celebrations adding a festive air to the city streets.
But it is perhaps in spring that Edinburgh truly shines. As the city awakens from its winter slumber, the parks and gardens burst into bloom, filling the air with the scent of flowers and the sound of birdsong. It is a time of renewal and rebirth when Edinburgh comes alive with the promise of warmer days ahead.
Edinburgh is a city of contrasts: ancient yet modern, traditional yet progressive, unpredictable yet endlessly captivating. With its rich history, vibrant culture, and ever-changing weather, Edinburgh offers a unique and unforgettable experience to all who visit its storied streets. Whether you’re exploring the historic landmarks of the Old Town, immersing yourself in the excitement of the Fringe Festival, or simply watching the clouds roll in over the Firth of Forth, Edinburgh is a city that never fails to leave its mark on the hearts and minds of all who wander its winding pathways.

We stayed in Edinburgh during the abnormally sunny month of June and we had the best time. Edinburgh has everything you could possible want in a city: gorgeous architecture, breath taking views, exquisite restaurants, cosy pubs, shops and boutiques galore and even a beach for good measure. It quickly made its way up my favourite list of cities, and I was super sad to be leaving.
Basically, Calton Hill > Princes St & George St loop >The Mound > Lawnmarket > Edinburgh Castle > Grassmarket > Greyfriar’s Bobby memorial > Cow Gate > Royal Mile. If you cover all over these places, you’re going to have a great day; great landmarks, awesome architecture, and plentiful cafes, bars, pubs and restaurants for a refreshment en route. We loved Grassmarket and it’s lively atmosphere. In summer, the restaurant tables overflow out on to the pedestrianised street area, and it’s a delight to see.
You’d never believe this beach was on the coast of Scotland. Although we were very lucky with the weather on one of the days, it’s equally as wonderful even when it’s a bit colder. It’s a large stretch of golden sand with rippling waves; there’s an adorable high street just beyond the promenade, both which are full of cafes and shops. Well worth a whole day out — we’d recommend The Velvet Easel Art Gallery on Portobello High Street, the art and jewellery in there was beautiful. We also stopped at Bross Bagel for a snack, another amazing find.
One of my favourite things to do in Edinburgh was to go a run around Arthur’s Seat and Holyrood park before work. While the way up can be quite painful while jogging (I walked a fair bit of it), the view and tranquility at the top is worth the effort. There’s a lake you pass at the top of the hill, and then you’ll reach the edge and be able to look over the whole coast. Once you reach the lake it’s either flat or downhill the whole way back, so at that point it’s plain sailing!
The views and features along this route rival any other; discover vast fields, woodlands, rivers and waterfalls, and breathtaking views across over to Cairngorns.
Dunkeld now has to be one of my new favourite towns. Not only is the high street to die for, but the pub on the river is one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever had a meal. The terrace has an outdoor bar, a large marquee, as well as copious amounts of seating, including picnic tables in and out of the marquee, sunny tables, and cute little bar stools and barrels by the river – something for everyone; you can read more about this pub/hotel in our other Edinburgh blog!
We decided to try and do a run walk to explore the water of leith. It follows the river from Leith right through the centre of Edinburgh. We discovered parts of Edinburgh that we never would have including Stockbridge (which had an open air food market called the Neighbourgood market) and also somewhere called Dean Village. Although there’s not much to do at Dean Village, the village sit upon the stream and its houses are stunning, a really tranquil place to walk through and I feel so grateful I got to explore it.
We loved exploring the views across Loch Katrine – but it would have been even better had we cycled round! There’s a wide paved path following the whole Loch round – And there’s even a bike hire centre at the car park!
Having said that it’s only because we scaled the hillside that we were able to get these amazing views, not quite so achievable on a bike!
While we didn’t actually visit Edinburgh Castle itself, we explored the surrounding area. It’s located at the end of the high street, and the closer you get to it, the prettier everything becomes. It’s also a stone’s throw from Grassmarket, a wide street made for pedestrians and pubs, filled with cafes, restaurants, pubs, shops and bars. Would fully recommend an afternoon of exploring that area, taking in the atmosphere and treating yourself to a pint and a view or two.
For a date night to remember, we recommend booking a night at the zoo. It’s an adult’s only event at Edinburgh Zoo, where you can wander round a kid-free zoo, grab a drink and a bite to eat from the couple of food stands, and even watch a bit of live music. It’s just an event they do during the summer of course. It’s well worth it! A lovely, chill atmosphere.
It’s got to be one of the most incredible things about Edinburgh, the fact that there’s a tremendously tall hill smack bang in the middle of it all. Although it’s quite a feat to climb, it’s well worth it. The views across Edinburgh in one direction and the bay in the other are spectacular.
Another breathtaking bit of greenery in the city, quite literally. Calton Hill is yet another steep trek, but again the views and the architecture are worth the effort.
One of our highlights of our time here was an Airbnb experience run by Julie — a sheep herder and her pack of dogs.
The experience began just driving there. We stopped in a beautiful hill side cafe and then carried on the drive through the most incredible valleys and glens.
When we arrived Julie warmly welcomed us, we met some sheep, and she then proceeded to exhibit her pack of working dogs — in all the various stages of training. Starting with the least experienced to the most, and then a finalé of two dogs working together.
All of her work in training is anything but tyrannical or dictatorship. Instead, she practices something she calls the ‘natural way’.
Hope to see you again really soon, Edinburgh!

The moment we entered our rental flat Roshan began exploring the whole place, and he was enthralled.
“Daddy let’s stay here and don’t want to go back to London,” he said.
All three of us exchanged looks in surprise. Was this the same kid crying non-stop about thirty minutes ago?
“Yes, this is our house until we leave this city,” said his father, holding him back from his excitement of running from room to room.
We had bought some eating stuff from Southport Morrison hoping that we may not get anything at night when we arrived in a new country. But we were wrong. Even in the night we were able to get some basics like milk, bread, butter, cheese, and some other crispy stuff for eating from a shop, very close to our stay.
After some light dinner we decided to sleep soon so that we would be refreshed in the morning to start our tour. As soon as I touched the bed, I dropped off to sleep and enjoyed a deep and peaceful sleep. I was up early in the morning.
Raindrops like slug trails trickled down the windowpane. Steely clouds hung low, heavy with more rain, smothering the town.

Edinburgh. It was a decades-long dream for this American to be there. And there I was, about halfway between Edinburgh Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse on the Royal Mile.
Alone.
The friend I was traveling with and I had just parted ways for the afternoon. She had other interests. I had to see Holyroodhouse, having read every fictional and nonfictional account of Mary, Queen of Scots, I could find over the years. Having watched every movie or program I could find. Having a general interest in history and specific interests in the British Isles.
Holyroodhouse is special to me. Even before Mary, there had been the wedding of James IV and Margaret Tudor in the abbey while the palace was under construction. Later, James VI would live at Holyrood until he became King of England and took up residence in London. So much happened here.
In between, there would be burnings and cannon attacks and repairs. Holyroodhouse has seen some things.
And I was going to see Holyroodhouse.
Alone.
That turned out to be the best part. My visit to Holyroodhouse was the beginning of my discovery of the joy of solo travel.
The Royal Mile is the road that slopes gradually from Edinburgh Castle at the top to Holyroodhouse at the bottom. It’s actually made up of several streets that run together west to east, starting with Castlehill, which runs into Lawnmarket, followed by High Street, on to Cannongate, and finally, Abbey Strand. It is roughly a mile long(an English mile) and takes just under a half hour to walk.
The Royal Mile is a busy thoroughfare, overrun by tourists and populated by colorful locals. Walking it alone gives you the opportunity to stop where you want and enjoy the view. If you’re walking and talking, you might miss some things . . ..
Like this guy playing his heart out for you although bagpipes are difficult to ignore!
This wizard floating in mid air.
This guy doing . . . his thing.
There’s always something to see on the Royal Mile, whether it’s the colorful characters or the rows of shops. So, so many shops.
But, finally, you end up here, at Holyroodhouse.
It was incredible to tour it alone, absorbed in my own thoughts. It was just me and Holyroodhouse. There were other tourists, but I hardly noticed them. I was having a moment with history, and that’s all I cared about.
Pictures aren’t allowed in Holyroodhouse, so I had to put away the potato I use for photography. (I suck at photography, and there’s no point in pretending otherwise, okay?)
Holyroodhouse is massive. You can tour parts of it online via the Royal Collection Trust. There is so much to see, from the state apartments (including the chambers of Mary, Queen of Scots) to the Throne Room and the Great Gallery. I stood at the spot where Mary’s secretary, David Rizzio, was murdered by her jealous husband, Lord Darnley, and his gang of assassins.
This spot, this murder, was the beginning of the end for Mary, Queen of Scots.
I stood there.
Outside, I was able to pull out my potato again and take some pictures of the ruins of the abbey that dates back to King David I of Scotland (1128, to be exact) and the grounds of the palace.
As I strolled the grounds (not the whole 10 acres, but some of it!), I wondered if Queen Mary had once walked where I was walking. Did she appreciate the lush beauty of the place?
Did she ever stand and admire this incredible view?
Finally, it was time to leave. My stomach was grumbling for fish and chips. (I gained five pounds on fish and chips in the UK and Ireland.)
The half hour walk back to the hotel would justify the fish and chips, so I decided to hoof it. I’m a avid walker anyway, so it seemed like a good chance to stretch the old legs, too.
There had been some instruction from our tour director about finding Princes Street if we got lost and following it and . . . more words. Who’s really listening when you’re trying to photograph Edinburgh Castle with a potato?
I set out in the direction of Princes Street. For some reason, my phone wasn’t getting any kind of connection, so I had no access to maps, and the paper one I had was kind of vague. Nevertheless, I set out confidently in the wrong direction.
Before this happened, I would have thought being lost would terrify me. I got lost in my car in the city I live in once when I was new to the area, and it was enough to keep me from going back until Google Maps became a thing. But then again, I did see a dead body on a stretcher and a swarm of cops arresting a bunch of people that day (the middle of a week day!), so there’s that.
But, I wasn’t scared in Edinburgh. Maybe it’s just Edinburgh, or maybe I’m older and wiser and more savvy now. I know what to look for and how to avoid a sketchy area, not that I saw any in Edinburgh. I’m sure they are there. As I strolled along, I realized I was relaxed and trusted myself. I was happy.
At one point, I spotted three people — two women and a young man — with a large map, so I approached them, hoping to get some directions. They stared at me nervously as I asked what street we were on. They spoke to each other — in German, I think — and looked, frankly, kind of terrified. (What were they saying? “It’s an American. Does it have a gun? What should we do?”) I tried to ask them if they knew the name of the street we were on, but I think they were even more lost than I was.
When I turned, I saw the ultimate “get unlost” solution: a tour bus driver! He was parked on a side street and vacuuming the steps of his vehicle with some little handheld thing. He cheerfully pointed me in the right direction, and off I went.
I think Edinburgh is still so vivid to me because I walked it alone, taking in every site, processing it all deliberately and thoughtfully. When there’s no extraneous chatter or other distractions, it’s easier to simply be in a place, be a part of it.
Upon finding Princes Street, I was still a bit turned around. I wanted to get some pictures of the Sir Walter Scott monument, and I knew I needed to go west. Waiting to cross a street, I asked a woman standing next to me if I was headed in the right direction. She responded that she thought so, and then said, “I’m so sorry, but I’m in a hurry, and I’m late,” before darting across the street and disappearing into the crowd.
“That’s fine. I’ll be fine,” I said because she did look distressed.
I continued on my way, still feeling happily lost and not minding at all now. If I wandered up and down Princes Street, I would eventually see the cross street that led to my hotel.
Then, I saw the woman, running back toward me, waving at me. Nearly out of breath, she pointed in the sky, “Do you see that spire ahead in the distance? Walk toward that. That’s the monument!” She turned to run off again, and I shouted “Thank you!” after her. She turned to wave, still trotting along, and I thought how kind it was of her to come back for me that way when she was in such a hurry.
And then I had my moment with Sir Walter Scott. I love Ivanhoe. His other books are good, too— the other Waverly novels — but Ivanhoe is special. I wrote about a book from my grad school studies , The Superhistorians, in another article. The author included Sir Walter Scott among his chosen great historians although books like Ivanhoe were historical fiction and Scott did take liberties with historical fact. But, he brought history to life and he did so by putting people at the center of it. He made history a riveting story.
As a history major who had been drawn to history initially through historical fiction, it meant something to me to stand before the monument to Scott and reflect on his work. It was yet another moment between Edinburgh and me.
Then it was time for fish and chips. And Guinness.
The main thing I learned from being lost on my own in Edinburgh was that it wasn’t a big deal. I have been interested in the idea of solo travel for awhile, and it seems to me there has been a explosion of interest in and information about it over the last couple of years. There are many articles online about why people are taking up solo travel, which typically include the freedom of being able to do what you want when you want with less expense, along with being able to immerse yourself fully in the experience. Solo travelers often note a boost to self confidence and self-knowledge that come with the experience. Solo travel can also be less stressful than traveling with others.
Would the imagery of the Royal Mile still be so vivid to me if I had walked it with another person? Would I have been as immersed in Holyroodhouse with someone else waiting for me to finish in a room or drawing my attention to something else? Would I have had that connection with a stranger that still reminds of how awesome human beings can be? Would I have enjoyed reflecting on the influence of Sir Walter Scott on me, a history and English major while standing before his statue?
Those memories are my own special memorie s— mine alone.
After Edinburgh, the idea of solo travel became more than just an idea to me. I now see it as something I can actually do.

Edinburgh. Known for its inspiring history, its eclectic catalogue of festivals and with it, an ever-present army of selfie-snapping tourists. (Can’t be helped, just comes with the territory, y’know.)
And whilst there are many wonderful attractions in Edinburgh, like any popular city, at times the main sights can become a little overcrowded, which isn’t ideal if you like your delights, day-tripper free.
Anyway, if this sounds a bit like you, then read on. We’ve been in touch with the locals who know this city best to put together the off the beaten track, things to see and do, places to eat, drink and generally watch the world go by.
(And to make things easy to follow, we’re going to be categorise each local tip with either EAT. DRINK. SEE. PLAY. Hopefully quite self-explanatory so we’ll get on with it…)
Dean Village (SEE. PLAY)What the locals say:
Ashley
IG: @ashleyWanders
“One of my favourite hidden gems in Edinburgh is the Water of Leith Walkway, a 20km riverside path that winds through the heart of the city. It’s a fantastic spot for a leisurely walk and a lovely natural oasis where you can go to escape the hustle and bustle (and it’s an absolute godsend if you need respite from the crowds during the Fringe Festival in August).”
What we say:
One of the most underrated scenic sites in Edinburgh. Although Dean Village is located about a 5–10 minute walk from the busy Princes Street. ‘Busy’ just doesn’t appear in Dean Village’s dictionary. What once was at the heart of Edinburgh’s manufacturing industry, the now quaint village is now a picturesque residential area, with old millstones, a temple and an ancient viaduct scattered throughout. If you follow your nose around the walkway, you’ll find the Dean Gallery and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, both free, both brilliant.
Bruntsfield (EAT. DRINK. PLAY)What the locals say:
Charlotte Ballantyne
IG: @justmuddlingthroughlife
“Edinburgh has plenty of suburbs to explore, each with their own atmosphere, to get away from the sometimes overwhelming city centre. Brunstsfield is full of local, independent shops, that’re away from the more common high street. Grab a coffee in Artisan Roast or The Chocolate Tree, browse for a new outfit in Biscuit Clothing or pick up some toys in Gulliver’s, then have a delicious meal in Three Birds or Montpellier’s!”
What we say:
Bruntsfield is a cultural hub, bursting at the seams with exciting things to see and do. The best part about it? Tourists often overlook it, which means you’ll get the chance to experience this suburb like a true local. As Charlotte mentions, there’s plenty of restaurants serving up the best local produce, there’s also no shortage of good pub grub and countless independent shops that’ll make your time in Bruntsfield a brilliant one. If you’re looking to stay out a little past your bedtime and the busy Grassmarket bars aren’t your cup of tea, there’s more than enough stylish, typically Scottish pubs and bars to wet your whistle.
The Stand Comedy Club (DRINK. PLAY)What the locals say:
Charlotte Ballantyne
IG: @justmuddlingthroughlife
“This tiny little underground venue is legendary in Edinburgh, having been the place where many world-famous comedians got their start. It’s open every night of the week, hosting both newcomers and better-established names — Monday nights are ‘Red Raw’, where any beginner can take part, with tickets priced at just £3. If you’re lucky, more famous comedians will often make a surprise appearance to test out new material, especially in the months leading up the Fringe in August!”
What we say:
Established in 1995 in the basement of an Edinburgh pub, the club has grown to become one of the UK’s best comedy venues and a mainstay of the Festival Fringe. The club is also no stranger to hosting famous acts, with the likes of Kevin Bridges and Frankie Boyle learning their trade at the venue and if you’re lucky, they sometimes pop back to practice new material. (You might also be happy to know the club has banned stag and hen parties, which mean most of the people you find there are indeed the locals and are there for a L plate free, good time.)
Stockbridge (EAT. DRINK. PLAY)What the locals say:
Iveta Zalcaite
IG: @ivetazalc
“My favourite part of the city was is Stockbridge, if you’re looking for a truly local experience; this area is packed with lots of independent shops and cute cafes. That definitely isn’t covered in tourists!”
Kieron Roulston
IG: @kieronroulston
“Stockbridge Market on a Sunday is an excellent opportunity to go exploring Edinburgh’s new town — don’t get a taxi, take a walk down from George Street via Circus Lane and take in the different character of Edinburgh’s Mews”
What we say:
Edinburgh is full of downright lovely places, but Stockbridge has to be up there as one of the loveliest. It’s stunning architecture, charming village-like atmosphere, and its abundance of local cafes and restaurants, make it popular with the Edinburgh locals. We could sit here and list the all of its main attractions, but we don’t want to be here ALL day, so our top 3 Stockbridge picks are: Inverleith Park, the Royal Botanic gardens and the Stockbridge market (Sunday only) at Jubilee garden. Do take Edinburgh local Kieron’s advice and take the time to walk down from George Street, he knows what he’s talking about.
Blackford Hill (PLAY)What the locals say:
Charlotte Ballatyne
IG:@justmuddlingthroughlife
“For stunning views of Edinburgh, skip the crowds on Arthur’s Seat and instead head to the south side of the city to climb Blackford Hill, where you’ll get incredible views of Edinburgh Castle, Holyrood Park, and all the way over the Firth of Forth on a clear day. You can take a direct route straight up and down if you’re short on time, or spend a little longer wandering through the Braid Woods nearby.”
What we say:
If there’s one thing Edinburgh is not short of its stunning views, both of and throughout the city. But a lot of the time, stunning views comes with a stunning amount of selfie sticks carrying. This is particularly true of Arthur’s Seat, which does have a fantastic view of the capital, but can get a little crowded. If you take Charlotte’s advice here and head up to Blackford Hill you’ll get amazing views and decent snaps, minus the crowds. Lovely.
Books! (PLAY)What the locals say:
Nathan Young
IG: @nathanyoung2202
“Edinburgh is home to some amazing antique bookstores; the first one to pay a visit to is Armchair books in West Port. Deceiving on first looks, once inside, it’s an Aladdin’s cave of assorted paraphernalia, soft toys and hand-written notes. If you’re looking for first editions of certain books, it’s highly likely you’ll find what you’re looking for, they offer Victorian and second hand books for most genres.
Next on the list is Old Town Bookshop, Victoria Street. This is a bookworm’s dream — with editions dating back to the 1600s and a variety of genres as well as maps and art for pickings. Summerhall bookshop features an array of varied exhibitions and events hosted there. It also has a small gallery and a café inside where you can purchase a Scottish Breakfast roll to kick off your day.”
What we say:
To be honest we couldn’t put Nathan’s description better ourselves. Edinburgh is scattered with many independent bookshops, a lot of them teeming with more than just the books. The pick of the stores would have to be Armchair books; it’s cluttered, it’s messy and its disorganised, but this makes it the best place to browse. Whether it’s fiction or nonfiction, it really doesn’t matter, there’s enough to browse that you could probably spend your whole time in the city exploring the shelves, searching for that hidden gem you didn’t know you wanted.
Dr Neil’s Garden (PLAY)What the locals say:
Sally Cholewa
IG: @choggzy
“Tucked away in Duddingston, just outside the city centre, this established botanical garden is full of twisting and winding paths lined with beautiful plants. It makes for a wonderfully secluded and quiet spot. There are often community events happening including traditional Scottish storytelling. The ‘secret’ garden even has its own curling museum as Duddingston loch is where the first official rules were established.”
What we say:
Otherwise known as Edinburgh’s secret garden, these gardens are THAT secret that a lot of the locals would struggle to point you in their direction. This stunning area is the handy work of Dr Andrew and Nancy Neil, built at the foot of Arthur’s Seat in the 60s. They’re more than just beautiful wildlife and winding paths to the locals; this serene spot is a place of inspiration, meditation and contemplation. The perfect place to plonk yourself and unwind.
Whisky, Gin & Beer (DRINK)What the locals say:
Charlotte Ballantyne
IG: @justmuddlingthroughlife
“Scotland is famous for its whisky, and there are plenty of options to sample it in Edinburgh — try a tasting in Whiski Rooms on North Bank Street, Bow Bar on Victoria Street, or Usquabae on Hope Street. There’s plenty of other alcohols produced in this country too though — take a tour of the Edinburgh Gin Distillery in the West End, or Pickering’s Gin in Summerhall. Or if you’re a craft beer fan, try Red Squirrel on Lothian Road, or St Andrews Brewing Co. on Potterrow. Edinburgh is a very international city; so expect to rub elbows with locals, expats, and a few visitors alike in most of the city’s pubs and bars!”
What we say:
Apart from bagpipes, haggis, or going one better with a deep-fried Mars bar (yes, they do exist). If there’s one thing you’re going to do in Edinburgh, it’s try some traditional Scotch whiskey, or equally, if whiskey isn’t your preferred weapon of choice, you might want a tipple of some sort. Like any city nowadays, Edinburgh has a plethora of bars and pubs to choose from. But where do you go for something different, yet traditional, that’s not heaving with tourists? You can’t argue with Charlotte’s recommendations, and here’s some more of our favourite Edinburgh drinkeries…
Jupiter Artland (SEE)What the locals say:
Charlotte Ballantyne
IG: @justmuddlingthroughlife
“Located a half hour bus ride from the city centre, and only open during the summer months, Jupiter Artland is hidden surprise for art lovers. The grounds of this old manor house have been transformed into something like an adult playground, full of modern art installations specifically designed for the park, incorporated into the landscape, which encourage you to explore and interpret as you please.”
What we say:
Most people look after their garden with a bit of mowing and the odd hedge trim every now and again. But when Robert and Nicky Wilson moved into Bonnington House, a Jacobean manor with a 100-acre estate, they decided to do a hell of a lot more. Transforming their land into a contemporary art park and gallery, showcasing work by leading sculpture and land artists.
When exploring this spectacular garden and grounds, you’ll find cutting edge sculptures and installations from the world’s best, who are given complete freedom to produce whatever they like. And due to the sheer size of the estate, escaping the crowds isn’t something that even needs to enter your mind. Like, ever. Enjoy.

At the castle no one was royal. They dragged along their common provenances, hometowns banging around on the cobblestones behind them like oxygen tanks keeping them all alive. In front of me an American woman blathered on about history to the cashier, a Scottish man who looked like he had fought in both World Wars and developed all of his wrinkles by falling asleep face first on presidential biographies.
“We don’t have castles in America, because that’s when the Native Americans were there,” she said, word for word, in a baby voice.
She suggested that he really should make time to visit the northern seaside, and named a town there that she had liked in the way an aristocrat might say Cartier to the homeless. He gave her a scathing look, as though pounding waves of his battle-spilled ancestral blood had carved the very contours of the Scottish coastline, and handed her a ticket.
It was my turn. He asked me where I was from.
“Canada,” I lied, so as not to be associated by a commonality as thin as nationality with the woman who preceded me.
The tickets were £19.50, about $30 USD. At least it’s free to visit the White House. In the end we always have things going for us.
Beyond the ticket gate the grey stones of Edinburgh Castle were rain-soaked to black. The other tourists and I became zombies at the behest of our individualized audio tours, wandering around the grounds glassy-eyed, bits of history lost on our daydreaming, foreign minds. A group of unruly schoolchildren sat on the ground eating oranges. Citrus disagreeably robbed the air of its earthiness, its wet stones, dirt and gunpowder. When it was time for a lesson the children fled, leaving their modern trash behind, fruit juice bottles, orange peels and plastic Lidl shopping bags crinkling in the wind. The base of the only remaining segment of the twelfth century castle looked like a littered patch of Interstate 405.
I found the American woman from the ticket line, now with her husband, at an overlook on the far side of the castle. The sheer rock faces of the Salisbury Crags angled skyward like a drawn knife over the grasses of Holyrood Park. Gothic spires formed the black peaks of Edinburgh’s jagged old skyline.
“They have castles poppin’ up outta nowhere!” cried the husband. He wore a knit Denver Broncos ski hat, shifted his weight in basketball shoes, and jingled the coins in his pocket. He gave the impression that he was agitated about missing a football game. At the time it was 3:00am in Denver, and a Tuesday at that.
“Fhak. That’s fhaking beautiful. I could live heah. I could live heah no problem,” said another man taking in the view. He had a big pink face wet with sweat. He pulled off a fleece sweatshirt and revealed a Red Sox t-shirt with Yastrzemski printed on the back. His friend was in a MIT Campus police sweatshirt. They wore their hometown like house keys on cords around the necks of little boys. Everything about them said that they belonged to somewhere else. They would never fall through the cracks of this or that ancient city. They would always be pointed home.
All of the tourists gathered around a fancily dressed solider giving an inaudible speech in front of a cannon. They held up digital cameras, iPads and phones and littered the space with the garbage of beep-beeps and misappropriated flashes illuminating nothing.
He fired the cannon. An explosion burst forth and its burned debris floated softly in the wind, like gentle little murderers. We all gasped and screamed. The sexy girl next to me jumped a mile and swore in some foreign language. She had an underfed waist and overinflated breasts. She wore tight, cheaply embroidered jeans and wobbled on the cobblestones in leopard print high heels. She looked around uneasily, like an alligator in a pit of marshmallows, looking for purchase for her assets, and found none.
We dragged each other back to the places that possessed us. The black castle left no mark. Its glitter and prestige did not dull our nationalities. It did not obliterate the ways our countries teach us to behave.
We don’t have castles in America.
To us castles are cartoons, the candy-colored settings of fairytales. I wanted an abandoned glass slipper on the steps. I wanted three drops of blood in the freshly fallen snow. I would never have expected that kind of magic out of the White House. I was trapped in the Disney tower of my American girlhood, just as obviously from my own country as everyone else.
On my way out, the field-tripping children were running around the tiny rooms of the oldest, darkest part of the castle. The cried out ghost sounds and giggled in delight at the creepy echoes of their own voices, bouncing off the walls of dirt and stone, returning right back to them.
Thanks so much for reading.

Our Moscow guide Dasha traveled to the UK on New Year holidays, and here are her impressions about Edinburgh.
I fell in love with Edinburgh — the place where castles and gardens compete with whisky and beer — and actually it impressed me even more than London.
Nothing can be compared to this atmosphere of medieval times, amazing grey buildings, peaceful local life and true Scottish spirit.
This is where peace and history go to relax, and you should too. Or write a sequel to Harry Potter. Joanne Rowling won’t mind as long as you’re happy.
Set the tone for this historical adventure by plunging into the history of Edinburgh and exploring its gems. Let the story begin with… 20 fun facts about Edinburgh.
1. Edinburghers have called this area home since 7th century AD. See if you like what they’ve done to the city that is sometimes called the Athens of the North” and decide for yourself if you agree with Robert Louis Stevenson that “Edinburgh is what Paris ought to be”.
2. The massive and gorgeous Edinburgh castle is built on an extinct volcano. The last time the volcano erupted was 350 million years ago.
3. The volcano`s crater got the name “Arthur`s Throne”.
4. From the ancient times the Edinburgh castle has an unofficial name — The Key from the Country.
5. The first people on Castle Rock appeared there about 1000 years BC.
6. Edinburgh was the first city in the world to have its own fire service in 1703. But it was a volunteer fire brigade, that`s why it took a lot of time to gather people and come to the burning place before it`s too late.
7. Edinburgh is the greenest city in the UK, since there are 112 parks in the city.
8. The first king of Great Britain James I (a Scottish king James VI) was born in the Edinburgh castle.
9. The city has a nickname — Auld Reekie (Old Smoky) which was given to the city in connection with an era when a lot of coal and wood were burnt for heating and the air was full of smoke.
10. The Stone of Destiny which is kept in the Edinburgh castle is still used for the crowning of English Monarchs.
11. J.K.Rowling used to go to the Nicolson`s café during a hard period of her life and she started to write the first book about Harry Potter exactly there. Now there is a restaurant on that place called «Spoon».
12. One more literature fact — Ebenezer Scrooge from the famous novel by Charles Dickens «A Christmas Carol» was also born in Edinburgh when the author misread the tombstone of a real person with the same name. He read «Meanman» instead of «Mealman», which means «corn trader».
13. Actually people started producing whisky not in Scotland, but in Ireland in 5th century. However, there are over 100 whisky distillers in Scotland. Well played!
14. The unicorn is a national animal of Scotland, while thistle and heather are floral emblems.
15. The number of heritage buildings in Edinburgh is bigger than anywhere. There are about 16 thousands historical buildings of different epochs.
16. Edinburgh is also standing on seven hills like Rome and Moscow.
17. About 13 million tourists visit Edinburgh every year.
18. Edinburgh is an art city. Every year in August the world best concert and theater troupes come here for the Summer Art Festival. Edinburgh is the world’s number one festival destination.
19. The Princess Street Gardens is a sneaky way to move from Old Times to New Era, as the gardens break the city into two parts.
20. Royal Mile is the most famous street in the city, it was the favorite street for walk for Scottish and English monarchs.

On the way we decided to pick up some eatables for us and two more pairs of socks for me from Morrison supermarket. Since it was Christmas time the supermarket was crowded with shoppers.
Hardly an hour was spent there and despite the drizzling rain, we resumed our journey to Edinburgh.
Observing the breathtaking sceneries on both sides, and chit chatting, we passed through some beautiful places like Preston, a town in Lancashire the northwest of England on the bank of River Ribble, in Lake District.
Every object in the journey was new and interesting to all of us. Our journey continued till we took a break in Westmorland, a motorway service station, off the M6 motorway. It is a popular exit station for the travellers.
We had our food and indulged in some shopping. The items available there were all organic straight from the farms. The other items like milk, cheese etc were also from the sheep reared by the farmers. One farmer had started this shop and the food cooked by his wife became favourite of the travellers…

Hi there! Maeghan & Oli here - we're taking a break to travel the world and hope you'll join us for the ride. 🌏✈️ 👫 www.alittledetour.ca

After Oli’s full recovery from food poisoning, we made our way to Scotland!
Back in July we toured Norway together with our friend Theresa, who flew in from Calgary. We traveled well as a group and kept bugging her to join us again on our little detour and we managed to convince her to join us for our final leg in Scotland!
We met up in Glasgow for just one night (Halloween!) and then made our way Edinburgh for some hiking, exploring and history. There was a lot to see and not enough time… Within the first 48 hours, we all agreed: this is a place we will come back and visit.
Here are our first few days together!
See more on our website www.alittledetour.ca🌏✈️👫
We left Glasgow and made our way to Edinburgh. The city is super cool and the medieval influence is very visible the moment you drive into the city limits.
We got to our Airbnb which was the biggest apartment Oli and I have stayed in during our entire year long travel! We had a beautiful view of the city, the university and the beautiful fall colours.
“Although the origin of the name is uncertain, some claim that there is a connection between Edinburgh and King Arthur. Arthur’s Seat may have been the location of legendary Camelot.” — — Earth Trekkers!
There are these areas of the old town that they call “Close” and it is essentially a square or alley that connects all the houses. They would use them to sell things — like the Fish Close, was for the fisherman to sell fish. Our tour guide told us to try and explore as many as possible.
So Theresa picked one.. and we followed her down it, but it turned out to be a rocky hallway that pigeons lived in, there was poop everywhere and they chased Maeghan right out.
We also learned about where the saying “shit face” came from. The wealthy people of Edinburgh would live on the ground level floors of the tall beautiful buildings because the top floors were a fire hazard— so locals would pay more for lower-level apartments, for safety.
But since toilets were not a thing yet… they used chamber pots and would simply yell out the window as the person was dumping them out.
Since this caused much chaos, the city put in a new rule: you can only empty your chamberpots at 7 in the morning, and 10 at night.
Problem is, 10 at night is when the pubs would close. So combine drunk people pouring out onto the streets with people pouring chamberpots out of their windows, and you can picture how you might come home after a night of drinking: shit-faced drunk.
On our last night we caught up with an old friend of Maeghan’s from Calgary. Anton homeschooled with Maeghan and we had the chance to discuss politics, homeschooling, the weather and our exotic spouses. ☺️

This 21 mile walk from the Scottish Capital to the centre of Dunfermline is a pilgrimage of my own making. It didn’t aim for any church or holy site; instead I aimed to go see my Uncle’s artwork being exhibited in the centre of Dunfermline. Ever one to make something harder than it should be in the search for growth, I planned out how I could walk from my front door to his paintings. A week before the route was being tweaked and twiddled with, down to where I can stop for an emergency piss if the need arose. Turns out, not many people walk from the centre of Edinburgh, across the Forth and onto Dunfermline. The only snippets of adventures I could find dipped in and out of my route; but none of them were complete. Perfect, an adventure is to be had.
I am not religious, nor have I ever been, yet through walking and adventuring I have found a sense of mindfulness. A spiritual freedom you may call it. At around 10 miles I experience a deep sense of joy and zen. Runners have told me they experience something similar, but I have yet to find that point running; instead I feel every excruciating second of the bloody thing. Yet, via walking I zone into a different world, one of my own making. At mile 15 I usually land hard like a Ryanair aeroplane before bouncing up back into my mindfulness. For this walk, though, I would hit mile 20. What then would that bring me?
It’s 6:30 am and my HipHop mix alarm is sudden and loud. ‘Damn it feels good to be a Gangsta’. True, maybe. Today I’m hoping it feels good to be a Pilgrim; whatever that is. January is in full flow, but storms have passed and there’s clear cool air in the city. Not many are trundling about as I leave, espresso heavy on my stomach, at around 7:30 am. Deliveries clatter and clang into Sainsbury’s, high vis workers smash down the lorry’s back doors and floors. It cuts the crisp morning air. I begin to look forward to the promised remoteness of much of my trek. Before long I am passing a quiet Haymarket Station; it is the weekend, no commuters are jousting up and down the road today. Air is blue, the moon is full and bright against the wisps of clouds. Their fast movement across its face does not bode well for the wind later on.
Edinburgh has a fair amount of old railway lines that have been tarmaced over and converted into sheltered paths. The one I spring onto is a familiar one for me; during lockdown I would glide down here to the beach, filled with regret when I get there that I didn’t pack more warm clothes. Even in the height of summer Cramond is a windy bitch. A jogger huffs past and a cyclist dressed all in black whizzes past. My espresso gurgles and shifts; what was my toiletry plan again? I stare down at my phone like a lost tourist coming out of Waverly. A Tesco is marked at the very end of my railway route and before I dive between two golf courses. My breakfast stop. Tree’s sway and lurch in the wind as the dark blue sky turns to pink, then a light gold. The sun is on its way behind me as a veer off from my Northern path to the West.
A Tesco employee stares at my walking stick in a bit of a stunned silence as I ask about toilets. Seconds pass before he forces out a ‘No’. Not quite the spiritual guidance I was looking for on my Pilgrimage, I admit. But perhaps this area doesn’t get many wanderers this early on a Saturday. I dart off and onto a well-to-do road. Cameras, locked gates and larger financed cars come and go as I wander through. The houses get larger and more elaborate, the gates get more defensive and taller. This road is very clean, I will say. Although there seems to be no sign of life I can’t help feel eyes on me. Perhaps a Pilgrimage is a trial of sorts. This is my first one today; do not shit yourself in a posh neighbourhood. It would be caught on multiple cameras and posted online as a VR experience before I reach the Forth Road Bridge.
The road comes to an abrupt end, turning into a path which seems meagre and slim compared to the vastness of the properties behind me. I’m now sandwiched between two golf course, various signs tell me not to litter or even contemplate becoming a member; they can tell I’m not quite up to scratch by the stick I’m swaying about. A dog walker, the first of the day, looks tired and fed up. He looks up under his hat but his eyes are sunken, sad. Is it golf that has made him like this? Or the weight of owning a castle? Or perhaps he doesn’t belong here, like me, but comes to envy and depressed about the life some lead. Either way we slink past each over on this wee pathway. More big houses flank me as I pop out onto a new street, these are chopped up into flats, though. Suddenly I dive down a windy old road and into some trees. At the bottom of this glen like snake I come across a small field of ponies. It is cold and damp down here, the houses look sodden. Then, just as I’m getting the heebie jeebies I turn sharply onto a stone bridge that spans a smooth, icy cold river. I stop for breakfast.
Before me the river is escorted into the distance by forestry and steep green banks. Tops of the trees are on fire from the ever so slowly rising sun. A golden morning stabs across the landscape, splicing my view into harsh warms and glassy colds. A dog comes to inspect my backpack and the fallen crusty crumbs of my pork pie. Their walker takes no heed of me. A few minutes pass watching the silk like water flow away from me and I head off up and out of the crossing. On my left a helter skelter of a building seems to have been slapped together in a rustled puzzle box. Is it a community centre? A church? I place a bet with myself and lose it all immediately. It’s a steak restaurant; I have driven past it numerous times on the way to the bridges. It brings a nice pang of realisation how far I have to go yet, seen as though the road takes a while and goes almost directly to them. I, though, must turn hard right towards the shore. North once more, away from the city and into the Dalmeny Estate.
A large muddy puddle welcomes me into the estate via a metal gate. I spend a few seconds staring it down. I’m mile 7 into my walk. If I get my feet wet now then the next 15 will be less than ideal. I jump it and slip with my walking stick. Luckily I’m alone and swan off up the long, straight road. To my right now there is a line of soldier like trees being pierced with brilliant gold. Their shadows barcode the road before me as it stretches off into a wide left leaning corner. My left is all ploughed farm fields, topped with bushes and trees as they slope uphill. I stop to take some photos for my own personal stash of farm related memories. A country lad at heart. Snowdrops welcome me at the various twists and turns of my golden road and before long the landscape opens up wide into rolling fields. A deep warm stench of hay and manure catches the wind here and there and now I begin to see some new faces.
“Morning!” A deep, booming voice bellows at me as a runner flies past. It startles me as I’m now zoning out into my zen-like world of farm equipment and muddy trails. “You alright!” I shout back. An exhausted “Aye.” Floats back to me. A few more people, dog walkers, general walkers and runners go past and each say good morning, how are you doing, beautiful day for it. It’s a social extravaganza here in the estate. My flurry of networking peters out and I slope down into more forestry. Thin, tall pines guard the shoreline that I can see spanning the view between their dark barks. The sun has yet to reach down here. A quietness settles around me, shells appear in the muddy path. I see a small opening onto the beach and jump driftwood onto the pebbly, sandy shore. It’s wonderful. Expansive and calm with the tide out, the sea is a far off foe I will conquer later in the day. For now it offers a definitive end to my Northern direction. Cramond Beach to my right is busy with people, but they are distant and seem to be across a dreamlike void. Cramond Island sits amongst the warm light of the morning, ships moving slowly behind it; their bright red hulls a stark brush stroke on an otherwise fair, cold view. I sit on the driftwood and stretch my legs. Silence. A swish of leaves above me as a gust of wind hits. Nothing. A leaf rustles onto my trainers. I cry, just a little.
On my walks I often cry, or get to a point that holds me to a tear or two. Sometimes it’s the silence, the calm. Or sometimes it’s a memory spurred from what I’m seeing, what I’m thinking or what I’m hearing. This Pilrimage has a density heavier than most due to death itself, which hit my family from all sides in all ways in 2021. For reasons I’m yet to really figure out myself, I have never posted about it on socials, or anywhere, really. A percieved lack of permission from who knows who, or a unwillingness to put any of it to solidified, permenant digital ink? I do not know, but I will say, on this walk I carried everyone with me, every step.
I’m just about to hit mile 8 and this is where my first tear drops of the day. But what a view for it to happen to. I spend longer than I probably should watching the world, not really do much. Voices behind me in the woodland break my train of thought. Runners coming up through the path I’m yet to tread. I look left expecting, foolishly, to see the red arches of the rail bridge spanning the water. Nothing in sight. I have a long way to go. Fife taunts me slightly as I dive back into the woods, it knows I’m coming for it. But it also knows how many trials I have to face on my wee Pilgrimage.
Shortly I see a bright square of stone drawn onto the curving coastline through the woods. Above it is a bright blue sky with textured clouds. The sun hits it hard, bright. A castle of light stone sits proudly upon the sandy waters of the Forth. But it is a way away yet. I trundle on through beautiful woodland, red trunks vear up to swaying canopies. Sometimes the sun strikes in and searches out the shining shells and sand that pop up here and there. Now and again a fallen tree crosses my path. Some old and mossy, some new and yet to be traversed properly. I cross a rolling stream of turquoise as it tumbles down into the grassy banks of the beach. It guides me along its shore before it spits me out onto another expansive view of the beach. This time there are less pebbles and more shimmering sand. My guide curves its way down to the sea through the banks. Following it with my eyes it leads me to the castle, now much closer. Mile 8 done. There’s an Eminem joke in there somewhere.
Green grass mixes with yellow sand like a paint palette. I pick up speed. My surroundings have me excited with this adventure. Castles, beaches, forests and farms. Dalmeny House solidifies my enjoyment as it pops up, looming proudly on my left. Vibrant, flat green grass rolls right up to its walls. It is a set piece, a view with a view and it stops me in my tracks. But the magic falters. Seemingly it is being renovated, or gutted. Ugly metal fences hug it horribly and metal work pokes out here and there. Windows boarded, taped. A pile of shite on it’s flanks. No matter, I have the castle I have been walking towards for the last few miles. My bright stone castle on the water. Once I get to it the magic falters again. No Entry. Fair enough. But, it too is boarded up, closed off, hiding. Recent work is obvious, but it is a shy place. Seaward it stands out and proud, but us landlubbers can only catch glimpses as it peers through shrubbery and trees. Perhaps I need some energy or water because my mood takes a bit of a dip. The next two miles are a slog, they are cold and my golden sun disappears for a long while. Where the hell are the bridges?
Maybe that was one of my trials of my Pilgrimage, a featureless forest that seems to never end. More likely it is my need to have a little rest and some food. Luckily the red metal work of the Rail Bridge begins to appear between the leaves. Then I find an opening and stumble down a muddy bank to a bunch of rocks. Perfectly there is a large fallen tree that acts as a seat. I sit, eat and admire the view. The Forth Rail Bridge spans across the water right before me. South Queensferry nestles underneath all three of the bridges to my left; my next destination before crossing the middle bridge. The wind is scathingly cold here. Boats bob about, waves lap hectically. I scoff my face and stretch my legs. My uncle messages me, “Where about are you?” I send a photo of the bridge back. Next up, South Queensferry.
Before I get into the meat of the town a woman walks out from her car in front of me and stops dead for seemingly no reason. I check my stride and go to pass her but she absent mindedly wanders to the side I’m going around. It is no big thing, but after marching for 11 miles now it was a strange feeling to me, stopped dead by a person not paying attention to anything. I leave her in my dust and enter a quiet town. Behind me the Forth Rail Bridge stands tall. Walking beneath it is nothing compared to taking a step back and viewing it. I always remember seeing it when I was younger on the TV and it seemed mystical to me. When I first moved up to Scotland it was the one thing I was desperate to see. Now, walking underneath it and having it as part of my adventure I felt a sense of connection to it. To bring myself back down to earth I finally found a toilet in South Queensferry and made sure I left my mark for any following Pilgrims. A miracle occurred there.
Soon enough I was dodging folk on pavements as I stormed up the hill towards the beginning of the bridge I was to cross. Once I got underneath it I felt a sting of excitement about what I was about to do. It’s cold, dark concrete consumed me as I looped up to the road from the town. Stopping briefly to adjust my backpack and jacket, I set out to go across. Then it hit me. A fear so deep, so bubbly and heavy that I almost fell to the floor. It wraithed inside of my stomach and my eyes became like a small tunnel. I staunchly marched forward as fast as I could, but once I’d reached the water the fear consumed me. Tiny gaps every 10 ft or so let me see the waters far below. Every coach that stormed past me bounced the large metalworks that struck up high and mighty above me. Wind blew and gust in a menacingly horrible way; it seemed determined to shove me over the edge. This was not enjoyable. I had hoped to grab some good photos of the Rail Bridge I adored so much whilst on here, but now… Get me off here! Metal creaked. The floor bounced. The wind blew. A cyclist went past and was nearly blown into me. Madman. At one point I swept past a porta-loo; what a way to go, blown into the Forth by a cubicle of shite. I could not get across to the otherside quick enough. But, had I known what I was about to tackle I may well have just stayed on the bridge.
It’s hot in the sun now. Face warm from the wind and no doubt the nerves I settled down on the steps that climb from the bridge to a road. Everything on this side of the Forth seems quiet and empty. No cars, nor people, mill about or make any sound. I take a moment. Now I convince myself that my Pilgrimage does indeed have trials, and the bridge was the biggest one by far. Never again! I proceed underneath its shadowy archways after a few more bites to eat. The road I’m on heads up and over a small hill before it dips suddenly down to swoop under the large motorway. In amongst the swirling, busy roads sits a boarded up house. It’s wee, messy and depressing. Concrete hugs the landscape and even in the yellow light of the day it is cold. This has become quite a tour of infrastructure, if that is the type of thing you’re into. I video call my wife.
Not as impressed by my feat of terror crossing the bridge as I thought she would be, she asks what my onward route is. Docks, Rosyth and forests, I reply. The sun is beating down now and I’m exposed to its warmth and the cold wind as I plod along. Down below me I see a grandfather and his granddaughter, fitted out with wellies, traversing a wind swept nature reserve. At least, these are the facts I project down upon the scene. Reeds and grass ebb and flow in the eager gusts. They shelter but chat enthusiastically. I stand for a while as they bounce away into the hazy grasses; tall bridges loom above them off into the choppy waters. I turn and continue along the most tedious road I’ve ever walked up.
Large metal buildings at the docks creak and boom as machinery, cranes, buildings get closer and more imposing. On the other side of the road there’s just shite. Sewerage works, quarries, a large car park where a bored looking guy in a JCB backhoe moves around asphalt. Usually I love a big of heavy machinery action, but I just want to get out of this tundrum place. It takes longer, it seems, than my whole walk completed beforehand to reach the pathway I need to dart up to get away. A pigeon coop castle stops me in my tracks, but the litter strewn path forces me to move on swiftly. My walks are all about moods and mindfulness; I find it difficult to reach those heady heights when bags of dog shit wave at me as I pass them as if I’m some kind of royal shitter.
The mood does not improve as I’m spat out into a disused industrial park. Large blue offices with smashed windows and fenced off to the nines greet me. Two lads saunter in front of me, neither see me until I whizz past them. “Eh!” One of them exclaims. Who knows what stories they have to hand to fling out at the drop of a hat. But I have wasted time watching families explore nature reserves and need to speed through my next section. I turn out of this and onto a roundabout. The housing estate across from me, and which I now need to navigate, is a familiar one to me. In my hometown you are looked down upon if you live on the wrong side of the river. And those that do look down upon those who live on the wrong side of the river, but also the wrong side of the railway. I won’t say which my current view stands in this chart of a made up class system. But, I look up to the right to a bus stop I need to pass and see a group of young lads, hand down their trousers and on their wee willy winkies and I decide to just head the opposite direction. If the Tesco employee was suspicious of my walking stick, or staff, wand? Then these chaps will want to make a few awkward inquiries; always trust your gut.
Pleasantly surprised by the streets and back alleys I wind down, I make my way quickly though Rosyth. I came across many cats but no people, until I reach the local football ground. It’s rugged and harshly laid out and windswept, much like everything else this side of the Forth it so far. A game is on and it has drawn quite a crowd. Shouts, punts of a football and conversation echo around the fields. I pass unnoticed as two posties discuss the ins and outs of the club. Before disappearing around a corner of wild bushes I witness the worst throw-in I’ve ever seen. But the managers shout enthusiasm, which is humbling and just all round nice, really. I spot a box of a school across the flat fields. More importantly I get my first view of Dunfermline. “I’m coming for you!” I point with my stick. Before long I’m turned onto a busy, loud road. Cars speed past kicking up dust, cups and I spot a perfectly new boot on the side of the road. How did it get here? Distantly I see a line of trees leading up a hill. My next stop to aim for; a cemetery.
What seemed like a mile or two later I cross in a rare gap of speedy cars and vans and onto a country lane. Straight as an arrow it heads to the cemetery where I pause briefly before heading into. I scan around; it is both old and new, both forgotten and intensely remembered. My road strikes right through it and around left, but the loop also goes right and back to where I’m standing. Lines and lines of graves fall into formation up the hill, around the loops and over through some trees. Some are old, almost green but many are shiny, bright, shaped intricately. There are plenty of flowers, more than I have ever seen in a cemetery. A freshly dug pile of dirt faces me directly straight on through the middle; orange in the glaring sun through the bare branches. I head right, along a long row of varying scales of gravestones to a bench. Thanking the folk on the plaque I sit and re-sock, eat and drink. I am alone only a few minutes before a blue car creeps into the cemetery, up the middle and begins to loop towards me. It stops. A woman of vibrant red lipstick and matching jacket steps out. She does not look around. Red roses are grasped firmly in her hands and she heads quickly to a grave. Roses planted, she says something. I look in my bag for some more food, I do not want to encroach upon such a moment. When I look up she is driving past me, eyes fixed ahead. She’s gone.
Part of me wanted to go see who she had just visited. Ultimately I decided against it and let the place drift in my mind. A beautifully colourful windmill danced in the middle of the rows. Around it some stones had faded flowers, some fresh, some well trodden, some slightly overgrown. I wonder, for the faded ones, what was the very last time they were visited. Why did the visits stop? Are they forgotten or are they remembered elsewhere? The cleaner ones make me weep; grief is all still too near for me. If I cry at an empty beach what hope do I have here? A van chugs into the entrance and stops, a bunch of guys jump out and begin to offload flowers; watering them in a very old tap that sits right near the gate. Another two cars enter to navigate the back end of the cemetery. I take it as a cue to leave, I have no purpose here.
Up upon the hill the cemetery swoops down from where I see the wartime graveyard, clean, green and precise in its purpose. Their white stone shines even in the shadows of the canopy above. My path turns muddy, leafy. Farms and fields replace roads and graves. This scenery is where I feel most at home. Dug out pathways, faded metal gates, long grasses and upturned troughs. Calmness descends over me and I stand for a while on a particularly exposed, high field and close my eyes to take in the sounds. Birds, wind, a distant gunshot. I move on.
Through a forest I pass silently in thought. A very recent fallen tree breaks my path in two; it has also stripped another tree of all its branches as it fell. Quite a sight to see, the sound must have been tremendous. Leaves crunch and slide as I navigate around it. I then bump into a runner with a bushy 80’s style moustache. He looks as surprised to see me rustling through the woods as I am of him. He hops one of the branches needlessly; it would have looked amazing in slow motion, I admit. Old walls of battered, mossy stones replace the leaves. They lead me to proper farmland, tractor markings and wide, open fields of various stages. Dodging puddles of depths unknown I march on towards a huddled collection of farmhouses and out buildings. A wee woman walking her dogs hurries past me; distrust in her eyes. A right angled turn left and I’m now facing North once more, and technically shouldn’t deviate from this direction until I meet my Uncle.
I am deep into mile 20 now. Dunfermline has been quite hidden down in the cemetery and winding farm pathways but now it taunts me openly. An adjustment of my backpack and a swig of water and I am set onto a thin line of a path on the edge of a busy road. It twists and turns before deciding to dive down into the town and before I know it I am encompassed by buildings and buses. It seemed like a click of a finger from farm to town, which is perhaps why this place is quite popular. My last trial is to find my way through the streets to where the gallery is; I immediately fail. Instead of heading right I take a wrong turn and find myself in a wee glen, complete with babbling brook. Another tree crosses my path, fallen fairly recently by the worn path being defined beneath it. I duck under and realise I now need to climb out of this quite beautiful place. How many trees have crossed my path today? 4? 5? I recount in my mind as I hustle up a zig zagging pathway. Onto solid ground and an uphill street leads me into the centre of town. I’m hot, sweaty and energy levels are in danger of plummeting right at the last. I head to Tesco and grab a Lucozade before my Uncle pops around the corner with a massive smile on his face.
Over a well earned pint we chat about all things worldly, both important and unimportant in life. Our food takes 5 working days to appear but I’m content. His artwork is awe inspiring, and a deep sense of pride grabs me as we view it and discuss it. There’s a deep, heavy therapy in the artwork that is echoed by the other pieces in the exhibit. Truly amazing to see. A few hours later I am dropped off at the station to head back on the next train that shows. As I whizz back along my 6 hour journey in 20 minutes I view my trials one by one, and a zen like sense of achievement washes over me. Immediately, though, I am distracted by a group of lads sat behind me; they are talking heavy Warhammer and a discussion has just broken out about one of them using the wrong paint for the wrong army. I waddle home from the station in Edinburgh, retracing my very early steps. My Pilgrimage is done and I am home once more. I never expected to find God, nor spiritual enlightenment, but I wish I had found more toilets and a steadier way to get across the Forth. In the morning I fly to Portugal, and have heard from reliable sources that Pilgrims do well there. But we shall see.

Mist rises. Saturday morning lacks the alarm clock. A full backpack sits in on a desk, waiting for me to pick it up and go. My second trip to Scotland’s capital. My first journey alone.
Sure, there are plenty of people to invite, but it’s mid-semester and students are swamped with projects. Not me — I only have two classes — so the desire to leave Stirling lures me to Edinburgh.
I rise at 7:32 despite no alarm. Twenty minutes. A comb strikes through my hair, gloss rubs across my lips, and I exit my bedroom with no regrets. The 7:52 bus doesn’t come until around 8:00; only four students sit at the stop. When I reach the train station, I catch a breath and keep going. I can’t back out now. I’m doing this for myself.
I buy a ticket for the 8:30 train and wait in the cold, open-aired platform. The squeaky wheels rush into the station and I enter with old women and old men. There’s an empty window seat, just for me. I listen to headphones and try not to drift back to sleep; only an hour until I arrive to my first destination.
Before I came to Scotland, when I watched videos of the best sites to visit in places like Edinburgh, I learned one of the cafes is marked as the location JK Rowling scratched the Harry Potter series on napkins. As soon as I step out of Edinburgh Waverley, I walk nine short minutes to The Elephant House, a near hole-in-the-wall restaurant with humble service (and filled with decorative elephants!). I order a cinnamon latte to get in the fall spirit, grab a seat at the front window, and open my laptop to Word. For the next hour, beside an Uber driver reading his morning paper, I write and edit and complete a chapter of my new novel, Floor Number Nine. It is the perfect rainy October morning. And While the street view is gorgeous, it makes me feel special when tourists stop in front of the window to take photographs of the cafe. For all they know, I’m a local!
When the waitress asks to take the empty plates, I understand I’ve overstayed my welcome, so I quickly save the final page of the chapter and stuff the laptop inside my backpack. Raincoat on, I flip the hood over my hair and search the next destination, the Writer’s Museum.
This free attraction is a short walk, tucked in a courtyard behind the skinny Lady Stair’s Close. It’s a quirky house with an open door and a sign which reads: Robert Louis Stevenson — Downstairs. Glad to get out of the rain, I step into the warm museum, greeted by photographs and displays. Stephenson’s original works, family portraits, and even household furniture (that I could touch!). After this exhibit, I return upstairs to a warm living room, complete with a fireplace, chandelier, wooden paneling, and old couples enjoying their morning tea. I learn this building was built in the 1620’s and belonged to Lady Stair.
Upstairs, exhibitions of poet Robert Burns and famous writer Sir Walter Scott decorate the traditional rooms. From chess boards, to cotton caps, to quill pens, I explore the artifacts of writers I’d read in grade school.
Returning to the rainy city, I walk a few blocks until I reach St. Giles Cathedral. This time, I don’t take pictures; I focus on the moment, soaking in the gorgeous stained glass, gazing at the vaulted ceilings, and listening to a pastor read Psalms to a quiet audience.
The National Museum of Scotland is not far from this cathedral. While this modern building seems bland on the exterior, its structure is fascinating. Totaling 6 floors, this museum is a maze of ancient and modern exhibits. I spend an hour and a half starting upstairs and working my way down. The map lists highlighted attractions, so I go in search for these — the canteen of Bonnie Prince Charlie, the clay creations of Picasso, ornate jewelry crafted by women centuries ago. What I find most intriguing is Dolly the cloned sheep. When I spot the thick glass case, I step as close as possible to the famous animal, surprised to learn the embryo was cloned in a Scottish laboratory. It is surreal, staring into the real eyes of the sheep I briefly studied in ninth grade biology.
I check the time on my phone and decide to move on to the next location. I’ve made plans to visit Dean Village, a quaint section outside of the inner city. Google Maps says it is a twenty-five minute walk, and I head down the street with an eager spirit. The rain is gone, fog rolls above the Edinburgh Castle, and I’m immersed in the perfect autumnal aesthetic.
I see a pub with a recognizable heading: Greyfriar’s Bobby. The church behind it is surrounded by a famous kirkyard (graveyard) where a dog, Greyfriar’s Bobby, is buried. While I don’t understand the significance of the dog or his master, I pass the pub and enter the church, expecting to find another intricate cathedral. While the interior is less impressive (I accidentally get lost, enter a set of closed doors, and find myself in the office rooms in the second level of the church), a guide leads me to the dog’s grave. Covered with a half-empty bush, the stone is planted directly in front of the church, marking the loyal dog who lived for sixteen years.
Large tour groups stroll through the foggy graveyard; I make my own rounds, using the time to take photographs of the fog-covered steeples and creepy tombstones. The perfect October location.
When you pass the statue of the beloved dog, right beside the Greyfriar’s pub, you are supposed to rub its nose for good luck. Not knowing this, I (uneducated American that I am) simply stroke the bronze fur and continue down the path on Google Maps. I have to see Dean Village, after all!
But another cathedral catches my eye. And after stopping inside, I recognize the brand names of giant stores across the road — I’ve made it to the shopping district. Princes Street, specifically. Across from me lies a Starbucks, an Urban Outfitters, a Primark, and a TopShop. I know where I’m headed after the village.
As directed by Google Maps, I hike down a hill under a bridge. It is darker now, and quieter, but I’m confident the destination will be worth the trek. The closer I get, however, (a sign on a building reads: Dean Village — This Way), the emptier and emptier the streets become. Eventually, as I step into the picaresque location, I walk alone. The cobblestone streets are wet. I slip clumsily down the hill onto my back, and no one is there to help me up.
This is okay. Laughing, I continue to walk down the street and cross a bridge. At first, the lack of shops and people makes the village underwhelming, but then I take gorgeous photos of the landscape, and I am fully content.
Tired and ready for rest, I return to Princes Street and enter the Starbucks. Here, I charge my phone, find some free WiFi, and eat a snack to prepare for the rest of the afternoon.
On the way to the Sir Walter Scott monument, I am captivated by a baroque-looking steeple. The cathedral, St. Mary’s Cathedral, is enormous, and I’m shocked I’ve never heard of the church until now. I walk down a broad street, full of wide marble buildings and Scottish flags, until I reach the front door and stroll inside. Again, my breath is taken:
Of course, photographs never capture the true atmosphere of cathedrals!
The Sir Walter Scott Monument is the largest and tallest monument to a writer in the world. As a creative writing major, this should impress me — and it does, however, this is the only site which requires a fee to enter. So I don’t. I do walk around the garden, stare up at the statue of Scott himself, and take plenty of photographs with the structure.
For the rest of the evening, I pass the time until my 5:30 train with shopping. Urban Outfitters has a 70% off sale. The Primark consists of three whole stories. I dip into Top Shop (because I’ve never been to a physical store before) as well as H&M, and before I know it, I’m racing through a line to purchase souvenirs before rushing to catch the train.
My first trip alone in the nation’s capitol. Needless to say, I am proud of myself and all the locations I am able to visit. Days like these help solidify my decision to study abroad; I need them, because if I’m honest, sometimes I feel like I made a mistake in thinking I could last four months here. Foreign travel, especially without any friends or relatives to travel with, is frightening. But it is also thrilling, and it calls me. Days like this prove I am up for the challenge.

Edinburgh is a haunted city.
I don’t mean ‘haunted’ in the supernatural sense, although I could point with my eyes closed and manage to hit several Ghost Tour aficionados who would be only too happy to prove me wrong. No, I mean ‘haunted’ in the sense that the city is a duology — ancient meets modern, and the ghosts of old Dùn èideann certainly haven’t gone to rest.
I have a friend from elsewhere who described Edinburgh as ‘having a quality’, and it does. The city is at home in all of its guises: tourist trap, hyperactive university town, well-to-do business capital. It is at once surprising and satisfying to see a place that wears all sorts of coats throughout the year, and it looks fabulous doing so. She may be many things, but the one thing she never is — under-dressed.
She also bleeds history. Walk across North Bridge, and you’ll find yourself in the heart of Edinburgh’s Old Town. And by ‘old’, we mean OLD. Your feet will find the gaps between cobbled streets that haven’t been updated since they were first laid, and if you look up at any building, you’ll see the ghosts of Edinburgh’s past, beautifully rendered in the form of intricate cornices, gargoyles and ornate carvings. Find yourself a close (Scottish word for tiny little street) and you’ll realise how little has actually been changed. These narrow streets are thrilling reminders of a long ago world that somehow still exists here, quietly maintaining a link to Scottish history.
It’s easy, standing in the shadow of Castle Rock on a winter’s day, to hear the bustle that would have been. Edinburgh captures our past, and feeds it to us in tiny mouthfuls. You don’t HAVE to look, but if you do, you’ll see stories in the walls. You’ll see markings and numbers left over from the original craftsmen. You’ll see heavy brass doorbells that no longer sing, but sit now as silent sentinels. In some houses and flats, original features languish beside modern conveniences: a Belfast sink next to a toaster, elegant sash windows behind a widescreen tv or immensely high ceilings looking down at a state of the art computer. It’s a quiet kind of ghost, but an effective haunting nonetheless.
It helps that we love our history, and we do everything we can to preserve it. Hardly any older buildings in Edinburgh get demolished and built up again. We’re used to re-purposing what is old, because although it is old, it is not broken. It’s a part of us, of our bones. They may creak, but they still function. As a result, new shop names are placed under carvings and signs that still bear the moniker of a store from decades ago. These things, they tell us where we’ve come from, and it seems important to the deep consciousness of Scotland to know this, to feel it. It’s the reason we sing ‘Auld Lang Syne’ at Hogmanay, and still compete in Highland Games. It would be a travesty to lose this unconscious memory of who we once were, to be out of touch with the stories of our national identity.
There is grandeur, too, in the ghost of our city. St Giles cathedral is a towering exercise in gothic beauty, sitting as it does, amongst tourist shops and chain restaurants. George Heriots School is a literal castle, complete with turrets, grand chamber rooms and teachers who flit about, crow-like, in antiquated robes. It inspired Hogwarts, after all, and it’s easy to see why. The city’s ghosts have magic. It is a type of grandeur that we so often overlook in our modern lives. Most of us spend our days in front of screens, from the ever increasingly large screens of our smartphones, to the computers that fill our thousands of offices. If we tried, we probably could spend an entire day never looking up or away from the eye-straining technology we rely on. This is not necessarily an evil — technology has allowed us to progress faster in the last 100 years than in the preceding 1000, but it does mean that we are in increasing danger of losing something precious — our historic identity.
So if you find yourself walking the cobbled streets of Edinburgh, take a moment to look. Look past the throngs of people hurrying against the sideways Scottish wind. Look past the brightly coloured lights of Christmas, or the sheer spectacle that is the Edinburgh Fringe. Instead, look for things that breathe quietly but do not speak. Look for the things that tell little stories of the past. Don’t worry, Edinburgh’s ghosts are friendly, and like all good Scots, incredibly welcoming hosts.

Part Two of our Three Part coverage of the 2023 Edinburgh Festival Fringe.Find Part One here.Find Part Three here.
In 1947, a post-WW2 Europe came together to celebrate the arts at the newly formed Edinburgh International Festival. Eight theatre companies who had not been invited decided to show up anyway, and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe was created — the first-ever “Fringe Festival.” Since then, cities around the world have formed their own versions of the Fringe, but the original remains the largest. In fact, it holds the record as the largest performing arts festival in the world.
For its 2023 edition, 3,553 shows graced 288 venues all across the city — transforming the medieval streets of the Scottish capital into a bustling hub of creativity. With so many productions during the festival’s three-and-a-half-week run, crafting an itinerary proved to be a daunting task. But with the help of a few Excel spreadsheets, a good pair of walking shoes, and a very full calendar, I was able to see 57 shows during my seven days in Edinburgh — a mere 1.6% of the overall lineup, but a solid dive into the Fringe’s immersive offerings.
Here are my fifteen favorite immersive shows from the 2023 Edinburgh Festival Fringe (including a few in the Edinburgh International Festival):
Big Kid Kindergarten — Play Immersive (USA)
As adults, we don’t often get the time, space, or permission to play. Interests become hobbies become side hustles, and unstructured play is set aside in favor of adulting. Big Kid Kindergarten invites us to reconnect with our childhood selves.
At the beginning of the experience, Soleil Kohl, our teacher for the next hour, asks us to close our eyes and connect with our inner five-year-old. A variety of familiar items are strewn across the room — legos, Play-Doh, coloring books, crafting materials, and plushies. We choose the songs that play in the background — nursery rhymes, Barney, Sharon Lois & Bram — the soundtrack of our childhoods. As our class time comes to an end, we tidy up the space and then cuddle up with a pillow for a quick nap time.
It’s a simple concept and straightforward execution, but a surprisingly emotional experience for some (myself included) largely due to the insight, guidance, and warmth with which Kohl facilitates.
Bodies — Ray Young (UK)
After a twenty-minute Scotrail ride away from the bustle of the festival city, I find myself floating in the pool at Deans Community High School. Colored lights, a sprinkler, and miscellaneous inflatables scatter across the surface of the water. We’ve all been given the identity of a specific international body of water and told that this pool is the gathering place where we’re all to connect. Twinkling projections fill the space and soothing music fills the air.
There’s an oft-used analogy of immersive theatre being likened to immersion in water. As such, the venue and conceit of Bodies seem quite fitting. Though the show offers little in terms of narrative, the space became a place for meditation, and a welcome moment of calm amongst the busyness of the Festival.
Brave Space — Aloft (USA)
We stand gathered around a sheet. When given the signal, our hands grasp its edges and we lift it above our heads, walk underneath, and then lower it beneath our feet. We’ve built a big top, but this one is more intimate than most — the quarters are cramped such that the delineation between stage and audience is blurred. Hoops spin unnervingly close by, acrobats swing from a trapeze directly above my head, and props are handed to us for safekeeping. At one point, I hold onto a piece of rope alongside four other audience members while the performers, kept aloft by the rope and their trust in a handful of strangers, twirl in the air.
‘Audience participation’ and ‘acrobatics’ are two phrases that don’t often appear together. The latter requires peak physical conditioning, hours of practice, and great technical ability… the former an unpredictable entity. By combining these two, Aloft has created a genuine immersive circus experience and necessitated the creation of a brave, trusting, space on both sides to make it work.
Club Life — Fred Deakin (UK)
In Club Life, Fred Deakin tours us through the Edinburgh underground club scene of the 80s and 90s that he helped shape. But this exercise goes beyond a typical bout of reminiscing — instead of simply telling us about the parties he lovingly crafted and DJ’d, Deakin invites us onto the dancefloor to experience them ourselves.
With a few DJ decks, vinyl records, and a cast of dancers, key moments in Deakin’s musical life are recreated onstage. From the genre agnosticism of Thunderball to the delightfully quirky Misery (“the worst club night that there ever was or ever could be,”) we dance our way through seven distinct parties from his past.
Part dance party, part autobiography, Club Life is an engaging and heartwarming deep dive into a creative soul.
Ctrl Room :_ — Black Hound Productions (UK)
In the not-so-distant future, technology has changed the face of the battlefield. Armed with lethal AI innovations, tech giant Polemas has become a global military powerhouse. As I enter the Edinburgh Army Reserve Centre, I’m greeted by a uniformed individual. Are they part of the show or an army member using the space? This blurring of show vs. reality was present throughout the experience and contributed to Ctrl Room :_ being the most immersive production I attended during the festival.
After choosing to align myself with the civilian resistance, I’m brought to their control room. Over the next 60 minutes, we identify an aerial strike drone, build explosive weapons, devise a military strategy, and attempt to decode a mysterious device. Meanwhile, our opponents at Polemas work through their own set of challenges, and every action, puzzle solved, and decision made by both sides influences the final outcome.
Throughout, our rebel leaders emphasize the urgency of the task at hand — some of the best acting I’ve ever seen in an escape room environment. The overall experience felt so realistic that at one point I found myself cowering under a table in genuine fear. As we exited the room for the finale, bulletproof vests on our chests and Molotov cocktails in hand, I mentally steeled myself for the battlefield… then breathed a sigh of relief when we were instead led to a cutscene in the initial briefing room.
Food — Geoff Sobelle (USA) [International Festival]
Food is a playful and thoughtful exploration of society’s relationship with food — from the grandiosity of the fine dining industry to the humble origins, and increasingly complicated reality of the agricultural systems that feed us.
While sitting around a large fine dining table, Sobelle hands me a wine menu with a very specific set of instructions: I should not drink the glass of wine he’s about to pour for me. Instead, I’m asked to smell the liquid and connect the scent to a year and memory. The odor of whiteboard marker fills my nose and I share an early high school memory. A mix of magic, cleverness, and absurdity brings this half of the show to life. An order of salmon rolls is conjured from thin air, an impromptu trip to the “Arctic” produces the freshest of arctic char, and our enigmatic waiter decides to scarf down all the leftovers. The magic elements may not be the most elegant I’ve seen — Sobelle’s sleight of hand is at times visible, but this is easily forgiven as the true magic lies in the delightful absurdity of the situation.
As the restaurant “closes” for the night, Sobelle pulls the tablecloth off — dishes and all — to reveal a large surface of dirt underneath. He crawls into the space, unaffected by the damage being done to his dress shirt and slacks. From here, a once chatty Sobelle guides us in a silent demonstration of the industrialization of farming, as well as the infrastructure and communities that we built around it.
They say it’s bad manners to play with your food, but for Geoff Sobelle I think we can make an exception. With charm and a healthy dose of playfulness, Food is a thoughtful and whimsical meditation on an important industry.
Funeral — Ontroerend Goed (Belgium)
“If you want to remember, remember.If you want to forget, forget.But sometimes, when you want to remember you forget.But sometimes, when you want to forget your remember”
So go the translated lyrics of the Latin song we’re taught at the beginning of Funeral. The show, by immersive stalwarts Ontroerend Goed, is a collective ritual celebrating finiteness and the knowledge that we are not alone in whatever endings we mourn.
From start to end, Funeral emphasizes the importance of community. In one of the most unique openings I’ve experienced, we’re directed to shake hands with each and every audience member as we enter the room. Later, we pass logs down from person to person until each individual has a post to sit on. At the start of the show, we are offered the chance to share the names of those we are mourning. As these names are read out loud, I feel my eyes prickle with tears, and look around the room to see my emotions mirrored in the faces of others.
The most notable display of community-building that Funeral initiated was inviting people to the venue’s basement for a cup of post-show tea. This created a space where audience members could unpack the experience together. While many shows at this year’s Fringe emphasized the importance of community and connection, Funeral’s poignant joint rituals and creation of space for discussion made it the most successful at exploring these themes.
Hayfever — Emerge Production House (UK)
Hayfever has the honor of being the “fringiest” show I had the pleasure of seeing at the festival.
As I walk into the room, a hot pink gorilla hands me two pieces of cardstock, one red and one green. We’re told that we’re actually in outer space and part of the studio audience for a TV show. At certain times, we can vote for an outcome using our colored cards, and at any point in the show, we can pause the action to request a monologue, a musical theatre number, an interpretive dance, or an on-the-spot “auction” of any item on stage. All the while, a drama about love, murder, xenophobia, and feminism unfolds.
It sounds chaotic, and once us audience members get the hang of things, it absolutely is. Heartfelt speeches are interrupted by songs about ham; during an auction, I deprive the male lead of his glasses; a monologue reveals the nefarious purpose this television program serves and the classist structures that keep it running. There’s too much going on, and the ambitiousness of the conceit often leaves me confused, but it’s just so much fun.
Klanghaus: Darkroom — KlangHaus (UK)
“Try and keep your eyes open.” But as I sit alone in the church basement, the lights starting to dim, the urge to shut my eyes is persistent. Eyes-open darkness is a very different sensation from eyes-closed darkness. Music fills the air, and I feel my body begin to relax. As the sound of waves crashing fills the room, the percussive reverberation of drums fills my chest. I didn’t notice at first, but live instruments are being played all around me. I’ve become so accustomed to pre-recorded sound within immersive audio experiences, so this realization catches me off guard and leaves me with a giant grin.
As the music calms to silence, the lights switch on and I’m escorted onto a couch. There, I unpack the experience with the two musicians who moved from instrument to instrument — counting their steps in the dark — to perform for me.
Whereas Klanghaus’ other Fringe show, Klanghaus: Inhaus, is a communal audio-visual experience, Darkroom is its antithesis — a solo experience in the dark. Both allowed me to engage in the music on a deeper level, but in the eyes wide open darkness of Klanghaus: Darkroom, I felt an intense, personal connection with the music.
Lucy and Friends — Soho Theatre, John Mackay and United Agents (UK)
After being recommended the show by a friend, I purchased a ticket to Lucy and Friends — an effort to diversify my Fringe showgoing. Halfway through the opening number, while covered in confetti and being crawled on by a tree cosplayer, I realized this show would probably count as immersive.
Lucy and Friends is a one-woman show where the role of “Lucy” is performed by the absurdly hilarious Lucy McCormick, and the role of “Friends” is played by the entire audience. Song sheets are distributed as we enter the venue, glasses of wine are shared with the audience, and we’re even tasked with cleaning up the theater. At the end of the show, a cell phone is passed around and audience members enter their contact info to start a group text chat.
Hilarious and unexpected, Lucy and Friends consistently caught me off guard while I absolutely laughed my head off.
Sensuous Governing — Sisters Hope (Denmark)
A line forms outside the Danish Consulate building, where a veiled figure in a white blouse and floor-length skirt stands barefoot. One by one, she beckons us forward and instructs us to remain silent as we fill out a cryptic questionnaire about the current state of our body, mind, and society as a whole.
Thus, began one of the most curious and thought-provoking experiences I had throughout my time at the Fringe. Over the next hour and a half I dance with a stranger, engage in a tender staring contest, and walk blindfolded up a spiral staircase. Throughout, the ethereal “Sisters” serve as my guide, their every motion a delicate dance whose tenderness I can sense even with my eyes bound.
It’s difficult to describe what makes Sensuous Governing so beautiful. It’s a strange experience, and will definitely leave some participants skeptical, but I also found it incredibly moving. As I exited the building, I locked eyes with another audience member. We tried to discuss what we had both just experienced but were at a loss for words — perhaps in part a side effect of having remained silent for so long. Finally, we both agreed, “That was really special.”
The Lost Lending Library — Punchdrunk Enrichment (UK) [International Festival]
At 314 floors high and with 78 spiral-side departments, this library is the largest collection of books and stories in the entire world. But, as the title suggests, it’s currently lost and we’ll need some expert-level storytellers to find it.
The Lost Lending Library by Punchdrunk Enrichment (Punchdrunk’s educational and outreach arm) is an enchanting immersive experience designed for children. The show is a fine example of entertainment talking to children rather than talking down to them, and in doing so creates a memorable experience for both kids and their accompanying adults. Throughout the performance, the actors engage directly with the young audience members, who field every query and conversation with an ease and creativity far superior to what you’d ever find in an adult audience.
Once we do find the library, even the most skeptical of adults is in awe. The set is absolutely gorgeous, filled with intricate details and surprises to be uncovered. It’s a real treat to see Punchdrunk’s immersive magic go to work at teaching the importance of storytelling. As we leave the library, we’re each handed a special “library card,” and from the squeals of excitement this garners, you can tell that Punchdrunk’s teachings have made a genuine impact.
The Most Toast — RGB Monster (UK)
The premise is simple: “Somebody in the audience will have eaten the most toast. We will find them.”
Armed with a large piece of chart paper, a permanent marker, and a wonderfully dry sense of wit, hosts Katharyn Henson and Ollie Horn interrogate the audience as to the quantity of their toast consumption. Approximations are not permitted. Uncertainty is dismissed. This is a serious scientific inquiry, and they accept nothing but precise measurements.
Charts are charted. Calculators are utilized. Integrity is called into question. Then, a winner is chosen and brought onstage for a celebration fitting of a toast-eating champion. The Most Toast is what happens when a brilliantly simple hook, a quick-witted pair of hosts, and an enthusiastic audience come together. It’s everything it’s advertised to be, but with a level of commitment that elevates its silliness into hilarity.
Two Strangers Walk Into A Bar — Tilda Cobham-Hervey (Australia)
I sit down at a bar. Someone hands me a suspiciously heavy tote bag and a headset, then tells me everything I’ll need is contained within. And that’s how my meet-cute begins… but maybe reality has different plans.
Through a series of audio prompts, worksheets, and semi-scripted dialogue, Two Strangers Walk Into A Bar creates the circumstances for a real-life rom-com to unfold. Except, instead of falling in love with a stranger, all that quirkiness and convenient serendipity sets you up to fall in love with that beautiful, messy, unpredictable thing called real life.
Humanity-affirming, grin-inducing, and absolutely charming, Two Strangers Walk Into A Bar is one of the most memorable immersive experiences I’ve ever had.
Without Sin — Without Sin (Ireland)
Two strangers enter a confessional booth and through a series of guided questions leave with a knowledge of the other far greater than what a typical 20-minute conversation would create.
As I step inside the dimly lit booth, I slip the provided headphones over my ears. Soothing music fills the space, and a voice instructs me to open the slot on my right where a deck of cards is placed. One by one, my companion and I take turns drawing from the pile and asking each other the questions written on them. “Have you ever taken something that wasn’t yours?” “What’s something you used to believe that you don’t anymore?” “Who are you most worried about disappointing?” We volley back and forth, sometimes offering elaborate responses, other times opting for more cryptic answers. Unable to see the face of our partner, all we can do is focus on the inflections in their voice.
The end of the experience arrives all too soon, and we are prompted to write a note to our partner. I reflect on the morsels of truth and vulnerability she shared and pen a heartfelt wish for a stranger I barely know, yet find myself rooting for. As we exit the booth, we embrace, squeezing each other tight through slightly teary eyes. Human connection is a beautiful thing, and Without Sin fosters it in a simple, but beautiful way.

If you’re like me (part Scottish) then a trip to Edinburgh, Scotland will be a bit more than relax and snap. I found it very important to visit the place my last name originated and was pleasantly surprised with my overall experience. I did my research and opted to bed down in Edinburgh. There, I’d have a wide range of cultural and historical amenities within walking distance or a quick cab ride. Edinburgh is a very beautiful city, and it’s lush charm is a mix of Vancouver and Prague rolled into one. With a 5-day itinerary in hand, I knew I’d have to make the most of it and pancake what I could, so I could deliver an article worthy of your time. So if you’re ever down for the Scottish experience, here are Travel Daddy’s 10 WAYS I ENJOYED SCOTLAND WHILE IN EDINBURGH…
I can honestly say without apprehension that Edinburgh has the best Taxi drivers I’ve seen or experienced on the planet. They’re prompt, courteous, knowledgeable, friendly, humble, and honorable. It’s actually quite a contrast from what I experienced in Santiago, where my safety was threatened. I would be more apt to describe them as mobile micro tour guides, possessing a high social IQ and left you with the impression that most -if not all- actually drive tourists around because they like it!
Tip them you cheap bastard — they deserve it!
2. WHISKY A DO
Oh mighty Scotch Whisky- the nectar of the Gods! Aside from Coffee and a choice Cab, nothing assaults the palette like a dram of fine aged whisky. Whether it be blended, aged or cheap, Scotland IS the mecca of Whisky. There are several options to get your fix; for me, the day tour to Loch Ness had an added bonus of visiting a legit distillery- DEANSTON.
After the tour and tasting, I couldn’t resist purchasing their premier 23 yr old. It ran me high, but every bit worth the cost since you can’t get it anywhere but there. A few days later as I exited Edinburgh Castle, I saw THE SCOTCH WHISKY EXPERIENCE, conveniently nestled on the 1st right side corner. It is home to the World’s Largest Collection of Scotch Whisky.
It Cost what!?!?!
My arrogance was quelled when upon bragging to the hosts/scotch experts that I’m on my 3rd bottle of Johnny Walker Blue ownership, they redirected my attention to truly rare and expensive whisky. I actually considered selling my house for the novelty. My son doesn’t really need to go to college right? I was even more exasperated to learn that some “poor” chap a week prior purchased a $25,000 Pound bottle and spent a total of over $40K Pounds. I’ll get there one day. There’s also a cool whisky chart which matches the flavor to the brand, for novice drinkers like myself.
Buy a bottle — Live a little!
3. LOCH NESS & HIGHLANDS DAY TRIP
I booked this day tour offered by The Hairy Coo through Trip Advisor. They offer many other tours throughout Scotland, but this one was convenient and enticing, especially with the whisky tour. The 10 hour itinerary was well thought out and included key stops like the Highland Hairy Coos, Glencoe, Whisky Distillery, Fort Augustus — home to Loch Ness, the Commando Memorial, Cairngorm Park, and Pitlochry. You can check the full itinerary here. Although Loch Ness was beautiful and worth the trip, you’ll be sorely disappointed to not catch a glimpse of it’s most famous inhabitant.
TOUR HIGHLIGHTS
What a Bridge!
On your return, you’ll cross and witness three amazing bridges adjacent to each other, one of which — The Forth Bridge- is a UNESCO site. The tour guide was friendly, knowledgeable and brimming with that Scottish wit.
Well worth the day — at least once!
4. FINE DINING
So many options- so much quality. Edinburgh is definitely a foodie destination for fine dining. You should check out my list of 10 AMAZING RESTAURANT & FOOD EXPERIENCES IN EDINBURGH. From traditional dishes like Haggis, Neeps & Tatties, to exclusive restaurants booked up months in advance, Scotland definitely has the food chops to satisfy your taste buds.
Food is most definitely a worthy Splurge- do it!
5. SO MANY PUBS… AMAZING SPEAKEASIES… GREAT NIGHTLIFE
As expected, I encountered more pubs in a 1 mile radius in Edinburgh than anywhere I’d been outside the U.K. People love to drink, and a pubs like The Advocate, The Cafe Royal Circle Bar and The Bow Bar, stood out for me as great places to knock down a few cold ones. If you fancy top-notch cocktails then there are some speakeasy type bars of high caliber like Panda & Sons and Head & Tails. For a speakeasy in the truest sense you’ll have to search the alleyways for Bullard & Worth — I won’t give you the address, but instead give you a clue. Most locals don’t even know how to find it, and it’s location on google maps was incorrect (purposely?). I had to ask several people and store owners in what felt like a treasure hunt.
Success at last…
I finally found what I had been looking for- approached, knocked, and was rewarded. The bartender was as an amazing conversationalist as he was a cocktail wizard. I’ll say no more so good luck!
As far as clubbing there are a ton of options from clubs teeming with college-aged patrons, salsa dancing, hip-hop lovers and live music. My article 10 BEST NIGHTLIFE IN EDINBURGH SCOTLAND will give you a list of good recommendations when you’re in town.
Edinburgh has great nightlife — party on!
6. CRASH A TRUE SCOTTISH WEDDING… THEN GET KICKED OUT
There I am- minding my own business at Ghillie Dhu, when I’m approached by a kilt-wearing Scotsman who wants me to buy him a pint. I oblige and as a reward he takes me upstairs to the reserved hall to see a “true Scottish wedding” as he put it. After a few drinks and introductions to the groom, I’m taking it all in being particularly wary of my visitor status. I stand to the side respectfully and silently appreciate how folks from all walks of life celebrate life’s milestones similarly but in their own unique way.
Uh-Oh….
Unfortunately, no one told the bride and ten minutes later, I’m being awkwardly escorted out of the wedding by the stoic security. No love lost though- since it was worth the experience and good blog fodder. I’m not encouraging you to intrude on someone’s big day, but try to synch with the locals in some way and get a true experience as to how folks live and celebrate.
People are different, but the same — even in Edinburgh!
7. SEE LEITH THEN WALK AIMLESSLY UNTIL PORTOBELLO
I took a cab down to Leith- a historic and artsy port Northeast of Edinburgh’s city center. It’s a must-see with top-notch restaurants, pubs and home to the Royal Yacht Britannia. The weather was great so I opted for a stroll along the canal, then made my way back inland toward the Leith Links (public parks). After catching some cricket and picnics, I headed back to the shore for some photography.
How’d I get Here?
Two hours later I’m in Portobello and realized with no cab in sight, I’d have to trek it back to the city. Using the street signs, I self-navigate past Holyrood Park and if not for my impending dinner reservations, would have walked back all the way. A kind local gives me exact change for the bus fare back to my hotel and I fulfill my dinner plans.
Great scenery & photos off the beaten path — dress for the walk!
8. STUMBLE UPON A TRADITIONAL MUSIC BAND COMPETITION
It’s a Sunday and I finally decide upon Princes Street Gardens, which is literally a stone’s throw from my hotel. With camera in hand, I knew I’d score some great shots by way of the park’s natural beauty. It’s descended location gives an almost serene respite from the bustling streets above. It isn’t long before I hear an army of bagpipes and drums. I was pleasantly surprised to spectate dozens of traditional bands practicing and performing in a competition- free to the public. I snapped away and appreciated the unique experience. The park is not open 24/7, and is worth a visit especially with kids in tow.
The Edinburgh 2019 Pipe Band Championship was amazing- the Gardens are still worth a visit!
9. BE AMAZED BY HISTORY IN OLD TOWN
There is history everywhere in the buildings, streets and closes (alleyways) of Edinburgh. If you’re a history buff or lover of things ancient, then Edinburgh is a mine of activities. Edinburgh Castle was built upon remnants of an extinct volcano, and from its elevated point you can see much of this beautiful city. A great portion of New Town with this area has been categorized as a UNESCO Heritage Site. As you descend down the cobbler streets, you’ll probably catch one of the many guided tours such as the Harry Potter Walking Tour. Much of the books and films were inspired by the streets and architecture of Old Town Edinburgh. I personally find it fascinating to walk among buildings that are older than the U.S. as a nation.
History can be awesome- don’t miss it!
10. WALK THE ROYAL MILE
The ROYAL MILE is the main street running from Edinburgh Castle all the way down to Holyrood Park. You’ll find a variety of top tourist sites like Arthur’s Seat, Edinburgh Museum, Scottish Parliament, St. Giles Cathedral, and Holyrood Palace. You can stop at several pubs and eateries along the way, easily spending a full day experiencing all it has to offer. I definitely had a blast and have the pics to prove it.
Grab your camera- This is Edinburgh!

Before coming to the United Kingdom, as an Asian girl, the most common cities that have been heard of were London, Manchester, and Edinburgh. However, unlike the previous two cities, Edinburgh is the city I got highly recommended many times as it will give a different impression of a United Kingdom city from London and Manchester.
This recommendation made me put it on the top of the travel list to visit instantly once I have time. When I finally know there is a chance to travel to Edinburgh, I look forward to this trip and find out why this city can earn that acclamation from people there before.
Once I stepped out of the train station, I instantly noticed why this city left such a fantastic feeling for visitors. But, of course, the first reaction that came to my mind was, ‘Am I in the United Kingdom?’.
Scotland’s capital city, unlike London or Manchester, emphasizes constructing a modern financial centre for people. The urban planning of Edinburgh has shown both the historical and contemporary image to tell its story to people who first visit this city.

Background: In 2022, the Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (TAS) programme funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) brought together experts in key disciplines across the UK to investigate the responsibility dimension of AI-driven autonomous systems, especially in areas where we might realistically expect that AI systems will be used to complement or substitute for human decision making.
On the 10th of July 2023, the four Responsibility project teams met in Edinburgh, Scotland to share the preliminary findings of our research, and to identify any common ground across our very different approaches to the challenge, which range across computer science, robotics, philosophy, law and the social sciences. Our declaration here, which will soon be followed by an expanded version including concrete examples of application to AI and autonomous systems, reflects that common ground.
We hope it will start a wider conversation about what matters most when we talk about “Responsible AI’ and responsibility for autonomous systems.*
*This declaration is a collaboration among researchers in the UKRI Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (TAS) programme who work on Responsibility in the context of design, development, procurement, use, governance and regulation of AI and autonomous systems. It does not necessarily represent the views of the wider TAS programme, its partners or universities.
Preface: Our work has crystallised a shared belief in the possibility of responsible development and governance of AI and autonomous systems (AI/AS). However novel the challenges these technologies present, they are not beyond the reach of responsibility, as a set of mature social and technical practices that underpin trustworthiness. We have been here before, with other inherently risky technologies that seemed ungovernable. And yet, those technologies that became part of the trusted infrastructure of many societies — biomedical technologies, aviation, automobiles, steam power — are now largely governed in ways that enable innovation and its benefits without pushing all of the risk and cost onto unprotected publics.
We must advance AI/AS innovation toward its own stage of trusted maturity: by creating, promoting, and embedding robust and committed responsibility practices in the development and use of AI/AS. Our joint declaration proposes four shifts in the framing of responsibility that we believe are needed for the responsible development, procurement, use and governance of AI and autonomous systems, in the UK and beyond.
First, it may help to briefly clarify some of the different meanings that ‘responsibility’ can have in this context:
Four Key Shifts on Responsibility Needed to Achieve Responsible AI
1. Accepting responsibility over describing and ascribing responsibility
2. Seeing responsibility as relational over seeing responsibility as an agent property
3. Prioritising responsibility as attending to vulnerability over responsibility as blame
4. Focusing on sustainability of responsible AI/AS innovation over pace of innovation
ANALYSIS:
Our research projects draw from technical, social, and humanistic disciplines to study distinct forms of responsibility (moral, legal, causal, role or virtue) as they apply in practice to responsible AI and autonomous systems (AI/AS) development, deployment and governance. Much of our work describes how, when, and which of these notions of responsibility should be attributed to the different types of agents (human and machine) that make up sociotechnical systems like AI/AS.
A deep understanding of these dimensions is essential for the future of responsible AI/AS. Appeals to responsibility are only effective when we can be clear and specific about what it means in any given context. But we hold that however rigorous our research on responsibility, its future impact depends upon the collective will of the actors who shape and govern our tech ecosystem to act on it.
Responsibility can be analysed in minute detail, but if responsibility is never accepted, never taken by the actors with the power to do so, these studies will be impotent, their power to guide action wasted. Our research must, to have its intended impact, be paired with bold and ongoing commercial and public commitments to accept responsibility for the power and consequences of autonomous systems.
2. Seeing responsibility as relational over responsibility as an agent property
The single thread that binds our projects is the power of responsibility to enable and sustain trustworthy relationships between people, organisations, institutions and publics. How AI/AS impact these relationships is why responsibility matters in this context.
Yet responsibility is too often viewed solely as an isolated property of an agent or system. We seek to find the ‘responsible’ component that caused a harm or accident, or the ‘responsible’ human that is morally accountable or legally liable for it, without considering the relationships that such attributions of responsibility help to hold together.
Even when we seek to understand what makes an agent in some way responsible for an action or decision, it’s the human relationships affected by that action or decision that make this question so important for us to answer. These relationships, and the responsibilities they entail, vary and shift over time and in different contexts. For this reason, mere promises to ‘act responsibly’ or ‘design responsibly’ are less helpful than articulating the ongoing, evolving duties of care that publics rightly expect and that people, organisations and institutions must fulfil to protect the specific relationships in which they and AI/AS are embedded. We hold that the relationships that responsibility serves must move to the centre of ‘responsible AI/AS’ research and its uses.
3. Prioritising responsibility as attending to vulnerability over responsibility as blame
Most studies of responsibility in AI/AS focus on mechanisms for responsibility attribution and the distribution of blame, liability or other obligations to responsible parties. While this work is essential, it is often silent about the vital political function of responsibility: to establish conditions of legitimacy for the human exercise of power, by requiring those who use or unleash a power to demonstrate due care for the interests of those it makes vulnerable.
While we must do more to identify and hold accountable those who use AI/AS in irresponsible and harmful ways, responsible AI/AS is not merely about finding and sanctioning ‘bad actors.’ All who exercise and unleash the material and economic power of AI/AS, even with the best of intentions, must start attending — and be required to attend — responsibly to the vulnerabilities that AI/AS create, perpetuate, amplify or relieve.
Foregrounding the needs of the most vulnerable, led by their knowledge of the lived impact of new technologies, also generally results in better protections for all; it is the most reliable way to ensure that AI/AS are safe and beneficial for everyone. Otherwise, by unjustly endangering human lives and publics, those who build and deploy these tools surrender the social license for these technologies as legitimate powers.
4. Focusing on sustainability of responsible AI/AS innovation over pace of innovation
Much of the debate around AI and autonomous systems focuses on the ideal pace of responsible innovation — calls to speed it up (for those whose primary aim is economic growth and rapid realization of technology’s potential benefits) and calls to slow it down (for those whose primary aim is the safety, security and competent control of AI/AS).
While this debate exposes important concerns, we think both impulses result from a misplaced focus on the overall pace at which AI/AS innovation happens, rather than what is needed to make AI/AS innovation sustainable, in the UK and globally.
Some applications of AI/AS, for example in the health and climate tech areas, warrant accelerated research and development, in responsible ways. Others, such as the automation of moral and political human judgments with irreversible and severe consequences, arguably require delay or indefinite pause. Yet we call for centering the overarching question: how to make a responsible AI/AS innovation ecosystem sustainable.
Sluggish AI/AS innovation that stalls from lack of investment and public confidence will not serve the UK or the world well. Yet neither will rapid, unchecked innovation that lasts only a few years or decades before running out of public goodwill and available resources.
AI/AS are already placing great demands on our limited global resources (water, energy, rare earth minerals), new stresses on social and economic resilience, and growing challenges for security, human rights and social cohesion. These costs and stressors must be managed responsibly and holistically, with an eye to AI/AS innovation that can take us all much farther, not simply faster.
We invite those from across the ‘Responsible AI’ community and beyond to comment and help us develop and refine these provocations; in the coming weeks we will share an expanded version with concrete examples of applications of these four shifts in Responsible AI research and innovation.

What I loved about Edinburgh was being able to walk to work through a beautiful place.
– Roger Allam
Sangam and I visited Edinburgh with our friends in December 2023. We visited this charming city for a day trip.
It was a long drive from Newcastle upon Tyne to Edinburgh for us. As we drove towards Edinburgh, we doubted if it was a good decision to drive in this weather. The weather was worse with heavy rains and harsh wind. Driving became extremely difficult and tedious for us. However, we managed to reach Edinburgh around 2 p.m.
It was still cloudy, but we were glad that it was at least not raining. We wasted no time and decided to search for a restaurant for lunch. The experience of walking around the city was incredibly beautiful and surreal. The place was as charming and exquisite as I had read in the books.

A new act asked me for advice on how to write their debut Edinburgh fringe show… I don’t think anyone knows how it’s supposed to be done, but I jotted down some notes, then turned it into this post in the hope it might help others.
I’m Ollie Horn, and you can see me live! Click here for my tour dates.
The reason you’re doing Edinburgh is you’ll get to do this show 25 times in a row. You can’t possibly leave with the same show you came with. So, all you really should be worried about is your first show of the run, which will be a preview anyway. So don’t feel too much pressure to arrive with something perfect; you’ll get there.
Spend less time worrying and more time writing and performing. Doing your first hour isn’t a big a deal as you think it is, and just as you’ve got a essentially no chance of taking this show to the festival and achieving life-changing fortune and industry adoration; you’re also probably unable to make any career-altering mistakes either.
But stop having self doubt.
First, even though it’s an open access festival, Edinburgh has just enough gatekeepers that with only very few exceptions, you’re unlikely to have been given a room at the festival if at least somebody who has some professional and reputational skin in the game didn’t think you’d be able to do it. There’s no inside and outside in comedy. Or, at least to the extent to which there is: you’re in!
Second, there is a reason why lots of people who have done perfectly well received hours at the festivals are unable to get themselves booked to do club 20s at the weekend stand-up clubs. It’s possible to entertain people for an hour in the context of a festival show without too much of a skillset. If you’re reading this thinking, “but I do have a skillset — I’m good at comedy!” then stop thinking that you can’t do an hour. You absolutely can.
Obviously do whatever you want, but I think there are two approaches, and having tried both, I don’t think it matters which you choose.
The first is to settle on a story, theme, or message first. For my first hour ‘Pig in Japan’, I wanted to tell the story of becoming a minor TV personality in Japan, and the bad experience I had on set that made me decide to quit. I already had the videos I wanted to play, and I vaguely knew how I wanted the audience to feel.
Once I had the north star, I then went about adding routines to see if any of them helped me with the narrative I wanted to write. Each preview I did I hot-swapped routines that I’d either done before, or had written especially, to see if I could hit a certain point or beat that the show needed.
For example, I knew that I wanted to make the point in the show that generally life in Japan as a non-Japanese person is abrasive and challenging, before I made the point that the TV industry takes this to a ridiculous level. I could make that point in a number of ways. In the end I settled on a routine about buying fried chicken, but it could have been anything.
So that’s the first way: think of the story that you want to tell, then write routines and jokes in support of that end goal.
The second way is the opposite of this — think of your hour as five ten-minute routines, and find a way to make those five bits flow.
The advantage of this method is you probably have three or four ten-minute routines that you’re proud of, and you know work well. Your job during previews is to stitch them together. Try doing both routines as a twenty minute set, and see if you can merge the two, creating an A-plot and B-plot, adding callbacks, and merging your world creation. Try taking lines and tags from one routine and wedging them into another that works by making a tangent, or a simile, or comparison.
Do the show enough and you’ll realise that there is a narrative through line that just exists by virtue of the fact that it’s you who wrote the routines, and you would have had your own subconscious motivations to write them in the first place; it’s likely that many of your routines betray a unique and interesting principle or heuristic that’s obvious to you, but potentially interesting to your audience.
Once you’ve settled on your roughly fifty minutes of material (I say this because you want your show to run about 55 minutes, and the best way to do that is to have fifty fantastic minutes that you perform with enough poise and credibility that the material has space to breathe), it’s time to work out what the show actually is.
One way to approach this is to ask yourself “how would I like my audience to recommend my show to a friend?” A less cynical way of thinking about this exact same question is to appreciate that the audience won’t remember any of your material, but they will remember how they felt after the performance. What do you want that feeling to be? Critically examine every routine and work out whether it’s in service of this goal. If it isn’t — get rid.
A good way to stress test routines is to take them back into clubs and open mics. Even while previewing a show I’ll book in as many new material nights as I can, and see if I can perform the routines I’ve written out of the context of the show. It’s a quick way to find out if the premises are independently enjoyable and intriguing.
If you’ve booked in enough previews, and you get the sense that the iterative leaps from one preview to the next are getting smaller and smaller, then do some radical things to shake things up. Start with your closing routine and see what happens. Start bending the truth to see if it makes for a better story (consider changing chronologies, merging characters (i.e. if you talk about Mr. A in one routine and Mr. B in another, just make them the same person), raising the stakes, etc). No doubt you’ll be audio recording all your performances, but take a video camera too and see how your physicality can be improved.
Don’t do a census at the start of the show. Where they came from, who they came with, and their professions don’t matter one dot. Don’t get all meta and talk about the process of writing the show or “so this is my first hour, and I wanted to talk to you about…”. Just thank them for coming and start with a really funny routine.
This is a joke, but the reason that the ‘dead dad show’, and its tell-tale structure of having a sad bit happen two thirds in is because you need to pace your show while thinking about your audience’s energy and attention levels. Even if they weren’t watching four other shows either side of yours, your audience won’t want you to perform with the same energy for the duration of the show. Start to feel and intuit the moments where you pull back, recalibrate, and go for another round. Like having sex, I presume.
I made this mistake with my first hour, until a reviewer pointed it out. In the last ten minutes of the show, the story I was telling felt like it was concluding, but I went off on a little tangent because I had a nice handful of jokes that I wanted top put somewhere, and they sort of fitted. The show didn’t need it, and was better when I just cut it. If you’re on the home straight, don’t deviate.
If you’re listening back to a recording and more than 20–30 seconds has passed without the audience laughing, then you should re-write. If you need to let the audience know that your mum is old for the sake of a routine about age differences, don’t just say “My mum is old — she’s 87. She’s the same age as my friend’s grandparents, which means…”. Instead, try turning that premise into a joke. “My mum is old. She’s of the generation that put decorative plates on the walls, like your grandparent’s parents did.” there we have the premise, plus character exposition, and a laugh.
This is a hard one to explain, and is something I’ve only recently started doing, so maybe it’s too much to ask for a first fringe hour, but vibe up there. Don’t feel the need to do precisely the same show every day. Be playful and responsive and reactive. It’s not the end of the world if Thursday’s audience gets a slightly different show to Friday’s audience because you had an intrusive thought that you shared with the crowd (with we can only presume hilarious consequences). Be present, and let your persona and personality drive the show. You’re not presenting your material; you’ve written your material to present you.
If you’re doing a free or pay what you want show, consider doing your bucket speech before your final routine not after so people aren’t listening to you doing admin and thinking about needing a wee and how far they are away from their next show etc while you’re doing the important job of getting them to pay for the show they just watched for free.
No matter how silly, ironic, subversive or cynical your on stage persona is, don’t be anything other than sincere and authentic for the bucket speech. Explain the recommended cost for the show, then invite the audience to “pay for the show”. Not donate to the show, or contribute to your expenses, or whatever other work-devaluing apology you may have.
Be brutal about cutting stuff. Even if it’s brilliant. It won’t be wasted effort, you’ll find a use for it some day.
Once you’re fairly sure you’ve got a show, then treat every single performance as a fresh start. Just like rolling a dice, the chances of you hitting a six today are entirely independent to what you achieved yesterday. Don’t worry if you forgot a bit, did an act out wrong, messed up a few lines. The audience have absolutely no idea what they’re supposed to be seeing, so have no way of knowing if today was a ‘good one’ or not.
Just take your job as custodians of their happiness for an hour seriously, and you’ll do great.
The final—and probably most important—thing to remember is there literally are no rules in Edinburgh. If you’ve read any part of this and thought “oh well I cant’ do that then” then just ignore whatever made you think that.
All that matters is your audience. Care deeply about them, over-deliver on whatever promise you’ve made to them, and do the festival on your own terms.

Usually I try to write a snappy intro, but I’ve a bit of a headache and honestly the headline and deck have all the basics. Let’s get into it.

Tucked around the corner from Wembley Stadium is a more quirky arena: the setting for Enitan’s Game, a kid-friendly hour-long experience for Punchdrunkards (and other immersive enthusiasts) and their children. Telling the story of a family’s tradition of community play, visitors are quickly swept up in the frenzy of joining in one more round of the game invented by Enitan’s grandfather before his life celebration takes place.
I attend one of the standard sessions where children are expected, so while the kids take the lion’s share of participation and I don’t have much to do myself I’m still charmed and enthralled by the standard Punchdrunk-quality bells and whistles: the endearing pack-rat-yet-curated style of set design with light, sound, and haze all are there in the expert quality of execution we’ve come to expect. There’s a few surprising special effects: a Jumanji moment bewitches the group and elicits a few gasps from both generations, and there are one or two spooky moments that coast the edge between adolescence and mature thrills. I do have a couple calls to action but generally the grown-ups are there to watch the joy and wonder on the kids’ faces and to listen to the endearing story told by the two actors. There are adults-only sessions which welcome guests with a cocktail and close with a Q&A with members of the cast & creative team, but I’m assured by the host that the show runs exactly the same for both age groups; no changes to plot or acting style is made.
It’s prudent to note here that Punchdrunk Enrichment is a sister & separate company of Punchdrunk, and therefore while they share some fundamental members and elemental values they are not the same. Punchdrunk Enrichment’s design emphasis appears to be placed on gameplay and narrative, rather than the aesthetic and mature tones adult audiences have come to expect from sister company Punchdrunk; this is consistent with P.E.’s goal of creating experiences for education, community, and family audiences. Visitors would be wise to note this if planning a visit.
We’re all in favor of early indoctrination of the next generation of immersive enthusiasts & creators, and what better way than to pivot one of the biggest names in the game to get hold of ‘em early? Bring the kids (or borrow some) and start the journey together; Enitan’s Game is an ace in the hole.

Generative Artificial Intelligence. If it’s not telling you that adding glue will help the cheese stay on your pizza, it is producing art of eight fingered children or smoking monkeys.
Some people say it’s the future. Those people are wrong. The phrase “I asked ChatGPT where to buy a stamp” floats into my mind during quiet moments.
I tried to give ’The Waiting Room’ a chance. It’s Edinburgh Fringe. I want to experience experiments and risk taking. Creatives trying and sometimes failing. It’s so vital for immersive pieces to be developed and able to react and grow in response to audiences. But this is clinical. Cold. Am I supposed to be charmed that the robot can say my name?
There are previous AI based works I have enjoyed.“Saint Jude”, by Swamp Motel, made a delightful mix of interactive performance and communication with an artificial intelligence.
The show starts late. We hadn’t received the information we needed to bring headphones and smart phones. Then we can’t connect to the Internet in the venue. The AI generates stories slowly and the audience’s audio stories fall out of sync with each other. Being called up to get a note with a new task is not in sync with the AI telling us what to do.
We are in a Waiting Room to sell our digital avatar for use in adverts and political messages. Tasks are handed to us by a performer, wearing a paper mask for no explainable reason. “Write on the sticky note”, “take a selfie”. The AI has generated 24 mins of audio and “personal stories” based on my prompts.
Our audience is nervous, quiet. Long periods of silence.The performers seem unsure how to encourage us to interact. “Pick up a toy from a box and dance”. Why? What do I get out of this?
The purpose of a system is what it does. Immersive is beautiful in unique moments. This show isn’t a satirical look at a new form of art generation.
To paraphrase “I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.”
In the end the AI stated that my desire to be a marine biologist and my selling of beard oil made a “salty liquid for the face”.
Well.
Quite.

(It is worth noting that No Proscenium reviewed the online version of this work last year. But this was a chance to be in a real life space alongside the performers and live audience.)
Entering the hotel’s hall, containing a giant screen in the centre of the space, we are presented with a musician, to the side of a stage. This is ‘Non-Player Character’, a live musical taking place in virtual reality.
Performer and creator, Brendan Bradley (who played all the characters as well as singing throughout), welcomes us all and explains that, since the other company of performers hadn’t turned up, it was a chance to let our audience be involved in the show. I took the opportunity, so I am reporting my experience as a participant rather than an audience spectator.
Wearing Oculus headsets, I and three other audience members take on the avatars of colourful rock monsters. We have no legs and have blocky hands and faces. A giant grey being appears and mocks us for not doing anything. This is the Hero. He sings about how he is going to save the day, so we should watch. Then he is killed, leaving us alone with the Non Player Character. NPC falls into a deep depression now his friend is dead and we need to help him heal over the course of the musical.
A lot of the choices are made by the audience voting for the routes characters take as well as placing items into the space to interact with.
The VR, on the whole, held up. The NPC travels around the space and the songs echoed around us. NPC would ask questions and did a good job of handling the responses. A highlight was the green player who kept trying to get as close to NPC as possible.
Sometimes, it did just feel we were being dragged along by the narrative as we travelled from scene to scene. Sometimes we did the video game time fillers of trying to get stuck in holes, throwing rocks or just waving at each other. Which was quite wholesome.
Shows about grieving have become a common theme in this year’s Fringe. This was a wholesome and touching musical with impressive graphics and well performed live music and lyrics. For me, it was heightened by being able to participate in the action.

In the heart of Scotland, Edinburgh and Glasgow stand as contrasting siblings, each exuding their own brand of charisma. These cities are not just destinations; they are experiences, embroidered with history and buzzing with modern life.
Edinburgh — A Timeless Elegance Amidst a Dynamic Rhythm
Edinburgh, the capital, is a city of literary dreams and cobbled whispers. As you wander through its ancient lanes, the city feels like an open-air museum, each street a gallery, each building a testament to the past. The iconic Edinburgh Castle looms over the city like a guardian of history, while the Royal Mile stretches below, a procession route of heritage and tradition.
Yet, Edinburgh pulses with a youthful beat. The city’s historic heart flutters with the hustle of street performers, the clink of coffee cups, and the intellectual buzz of university life. There’s a juxtaposition here — the old-world charm of the Old Town, where every alleyway tells a story, against the New Town’s neoclassical grace, alive with chic boutiques and modern gastronomy.

Although my ancestry comes from Scotland, it was never that high on my travel list.
I’m not sure why — I guess other locations just sounded more exciting. So when my dad planned a trip for our family to explore Scotland, it sounded fun, but not like a place to cross off my bucket list.
That all changed when I got to the country.
Scotland was amazing; truly a place I could see myself living someday. I was shocked by how much I loved it — the people, the city, the country, the food, the atmosphere, everything.
We went all over, starting in Glasgow. That beautiful gothic city was quite the introduction to the country, but once we hopped on the train to head to our next destination, the Isle of Eriska on the western coast, we started to really see the beauty Scotland has to offer.
The Isle of Eriska was its own private island, complete with a unique, castle-style hotel, activities, and a spot to watch otters playing in the ocean at sunrise.
It was magical.
The rest of the trip was just as exciting, with multiple castle ruin tours, spending time on Loch Ness looking for the…

Photography Walks: Edinburgh, Scotland
Walk Two: A Picturebook of a Short Stay in Scotland’s capital
It started out as a treat for our 12 year old daughter. She wanted to see the pandas in Edinburgh Zoo which is 245 miles (395K) away! A fresh urgency to fulfilling this request was the forthcoming removal of the pandas back to China.
We decided that a couple of nights stay was required and set off early on day one. The delights of an Air B+B awaited us. We are non-smokers and chose a non-smoking flat. The previous visitors clearly had no regard for this and the flat stank. And in the second bedroom the broken blind was hidden in the wardrobe. Grrrr. Open windows, emergency window coverings, copious amounts of air freshener and complaints to the owner. Well, we’ll never stay there again! Air B+B has served us well over the years but not this time.
As well as the zoo and pandas our daughter’s idea of a good time is shopping for clothes. So after the zoo mum and daughter went shopping and I took the opportunity to wander with my camera and catch up with them here and there.
One thing we did together was to visit the Royal Yacht Britannia which is now a tourist attraction on Edinburgh’s docks. Retired…

I stood shivering next to the sea at Wardie Bay, a huge grin plastered across my face. I had just done my first ever cold dip. My husband was looking at me bemused, surprised I had actually done it (we both know I’m more of a cup-of-tea-on-the-sofa type). I felt emotional, thinking about all the life we had squeezed into the past year and aware that our time in Edinburgh was coming to an end.
In April 2024 I moved from London to Edinburgh and now, just a little over a year later, I have moved back.
When I told people about this move their first question would often be ‘have you moved for work?’ To which I would reply ‘no, I moved for fun and work moved with me!’ Relocating to Edinburgh wasn’t driven by a job offer and it wasn’t a strategic career move. It was a move led by life.
Our tenancy agreement in London was coming to an end, we weren’t quite ready to buy and when it came to thinking about where to rent next I floated a question: ‘shall we leave London?’
We toyed with some more exotic options, but settled on the land of the deep fried mars bar and tattie scone. This was partly because I had visited Edinburgh before and always felt at home in the city. But it was also partly practical: it’s English-speaking, there was much more likelihood of us keeping our jobs, it’s not too far and it’s low risk because as a tenant you can hand in your notice and leave within 28-days (yes, really… Scotland does things better).
Both Jason (the husband) and I got the move signed off by work, bundled our possessions into the car and journeyed north.
Although lots of people have been delighted by our move, some have been a bit perplexed. Aside from the fact that we chose Scotland (why not Lisbon or Paris or somewhere… sunny?), and the fact we made the move knowing it would be temporary (why go to all that effort?), there was a third oddity tugging at people’s minds: why did we move if it wasn’t for work?
I find that last reaction particularly interesting, as it hints at a wider cultural phenomenon. Today, a large part of our identity is tied up in what we do for a living. Even that phrase ‘for a living’ doesn’t really make sense anymore — do we really just work for a living? Or do we work for a sense of self, the desire for fulfilment and, in some cases, the drive to attain a certain social status?
There is, of course, a mounting counter-movement that is pushing back against the way work is swallowing our lives whole, for example the rise of the four-day work week, or the increase in remote-working — which is expected to grow 25% by 2030. Demand for jobs with flexibility is on the rise, suggesting that more of us want to fit work around life, rather than the other way around.
As someone who has pivoted their career to the social/ environmental impact sector, it would be quite ironic if I thought that working for a bigger purpose was a bad thing. Of course I don’t. But I do believe that you can be career-motivated in general, and still seek out life experiences that have nothing to do with job prospects and may, even, negatively impact your career, albeit temporarily.
The important point is that it’s not a zero-sum game, it’s a pendulum swing. Sometimes work leads, sometimes it’s adventure and sometimes other responsibilities will take the limelight. (Or at least that’s how I think it should be).
We rented a flat in New Town, working from there most days, occasionally taking our laptops to nearby coffee shops. My arrangement with work was that I would come down to London once a month and spend two days in the office (the typical policy is two days a week in office). When I was in London it was chaotic and jam-packed, but when I returned to Edinburgh it was quiet and much more spontaneous (thanks to few social obligations).
Overall though, I would do it again in a heartbeat.
Not everyone has the ability to up and move — whether due to work, medical needs or the reality of family life, so understandably this is a privileged position to be in.
If you are in a position to prioritise an adventure — however big or small — here are some tips:
My time in Edinburgh isn’t a footnote, it’s a full chapter in my book of life. I still care deeply about my work, especially when it comes to using my working life to make a positive difference (however small), but I also care about living with intention.
And if you’ve made it this far, maybe you’re ready to do the same.
Why not try…
There’s more where that came from, so if you’re planning a trip don’t be afraid to ask for recommendations!

I made a new friend by happenstance. Recently I accidentally destroyed an old, precious book of mine, and April Smith, owner of Booksmith Conservation, restores them for a living (beautifully, I might add). She also completed an archaeological dig at the Macedonia-Greece border in the 1990s (!!🤓) — one of the places I will expand my research to in the coming years. Plus, her job is so cool; I was friendly-jealous and mesmerized by the process of book preservation. She’s taking a trip to Scotland this summer, and I remembered that I have a list of spots and tips I curated a while back for friends visiting the Highlands and Edinburgh I haven’t shared here yet. I wrote this quickly, soon after my last trip there (pre-COVID), but I imagine many of the same general things still apply. So it’s a bit hodge-podge in style, structure, and content, but that’s because Scotland trips don’t really need to be planned — Scotland plans you.
Highlands Lodging:
One thing to keep in mind is that most bed and breakfasts in the Highlands are not yet online (weirdly) — so we thought Portree was all booked up before arriving, but you really can show up, and all the hundreds of B&Bs you pass will have either a “vacancy” sign or a “no vacancy” sign. It’s a nice system if you want to walk around a bit and meet the (very kind) owners, who are always willing to let you glance at the room and see if it’s charming enough to suit your needs before locking in the (very affordable) deal.
Basically, this is my way of saying don’t pre-book anything in the Highlands. Just follow your intuition and let yourself be guided by the lovely locals.
Highlands Info:
Oban is spectacular. It won’t be difficult, but be sure you catch the sunset there. It’s life changing. And if possible, have fish ‘n chips from a place that has fresh catches every day.
The Isle of Skye is also gorgeous —even if you have gray weather (like we did), it comes in spurts and doesn’t really rain that hard, so don’t let it keep you inside. Bring a billed rain jacket if you have one—it’s what everyone wears.
I don’t know where you’re planning to stay, but I strongly suggest having dinner in Portree at least once. There is such an impressive collection of high-end seafood restaurants concentrated there. We found a new one we recommend the highest — but I’m sure they are all good. There are several fish ‘n chips places, too — but I had the best fish ‘n chips I’ve ever had in the little take-it-to-go place in the center if Portree. You’ll notice it just by walking around for five minutes because Portree is small. They definitely have fresh fish every day, most often from only an hour ago. Add the salt and vinegar and order a side of any of the homemade sauces that you tend to like elsewhere (like tartar sauce or curry sauce).
If you want to do a tour of Talisker, you’ll have to book it in advance — our way of seeing the distilleries was actually to just go to the bar and order a flight. Talisker’s bar wasn’t finished yet, but if you’re interested in buying a bottle, they will give you a taste. Talisker is the famous one, though, so it's a bit touristy (still worth a stop!). I enjoyed the smaller distilleries better — they were friendlier and felt more Scottish.
In general, when driving, don’t be afraid to make unplanned stops along the way! We found several little hiking paths that were well-marked and let you choose via signposts “waterfall versus lair,” etc. all along the way. We also made an unplanned stop in the (very small) town of Sligachan on Skye where we could try any whisky our heart desired for very cheap. The town is basically a little rest stop close to Talisker, but worth spending some time in if you don’t get to do a tour of Talisker (we skipped it). In short, the Highlands are perfect for exploring.
I’m sure you will learn this when you arrive, but just to give you a taste of the mantra: “There are no trespassing laws in Scotland” — so you can literally walk anywhere, go through any gate, and explore wherever your heart desires. The farmers you meet encourage it — and seem to be proud of this aspect of Scotland. They will tell you if the bulls are out (and still, you can go through), but otherwise, they truly don’t mind you taking hikes through their incredible properties, which, together, make up Scotland. :)
Portree Restaurants:
I was told the best ones are №1 and Scorrybreac restaurants, but we didn’t book in advance, and in the summertime, they tend to be full, so we didn’t get to try them.
There are several restaurants nearby of a similar caliber, which we just walked past and begged for a reservation at dinner time (most were full).
We ended up trying Dulce and Brose with reservations one evening. It was overhyped but still tasty. We also tried another one by waiting in the bar area until they gave us a table — and it was so good that we added it to Google Maps and gave it its first 5-star review. It was seriously amazing. The name is Caroy House (it’s in cursive and super nondescript, so easy to miss, but worth finding!!). I recommend the smoked haddock risotto, the hake, the white wines they offer, and any of the desserts, really. It was spectacular. (Update from 2024: looks like it might be closed, thanks COVID).
Also, try the bakeries in Portree — and the little sandwich shops and savory pie places (anywhere, really, if you see a nice-looking pie).
EDINBURGH (EDI)
Italian:
1. For a very fancy night, you could try for a reservation at Locanda De Gusti (102 Dalry Rd). The food is top-notch homemade Italian; but it’s a small place so I’d guess that they are full already for the dates you’re there. Still worth a try!
2. For a very close second, make a reservation at a place Divino Enoteca (5 Merchant St). This place is large, so it almost always can fit you in for a same-night reservation, but it still has low, gorgeous lighting and punch-you-in-the-face, delicious food.
3. Finally, if you haven’t had a chance to try one of Jaimie Oliver’s restaurants elsewhere in the UK, it’s always a decent option. Jaimie’s Italian (54 George Street) is technically a chain, but it still serves pretty remarkable and creative Italian food. It’s a good lunch option if you’re staying nearby, but it's not worth trekking to.
Indian:
There is incredible Indian options all over Edinburgh, and I’m yet to try a bad one.. but these are the ones I’ve tried and would highly recommend. Regardless of whether you’re into spicy food or not, these places are a life experience:
1. Dishoom Edinburgh (3a St Andrew Square): This place started in London but has a few more now because of how perfect it is. Small plates, try-everything sort of style + delicious and seriously amazing cocktails. Matt and I decided to eat here twice in one week once, and I would have eaten there again. Tip — ask to eat downstairs if they will let you! The vibe of the bar seating is cooler (both metaphorically and literally) than the upstairs, which gets very hot in the summertime.
2. Tuk Tuk Indian Street Food: a hipster-style BYOB place that is quick, easy, and delicious.
3. Kamasutra Indo Tapas Restaurant (16 Drummond St) — this place is a little further out (and by further out, it’s like a 20 min. walk from George Street versus everything else), but that might turn out to be a good thing if other places are fully booked. It’s strikingly good and affordable too.
4. Ghurka Cafe (27 Cockburn St) is the first Indian place I discovered, so it has a very special place in my heart. I’ve taken every guest who visited me in Edi, and it was always a crowd pleaser. It’s a no frills kind of place (for instance, I think they only serve beer and average quality wine), but the flavors of the food are so good it will make you want to lick your plate clean (my not-so-new friend Mary’s son memorably did this). And it’s actually Nepalese so the dishes are really close to northern Indian dishes, very rich and pleasing. The location is super central and usually quite full, but somehow, they have always managed to fit me in without a reservation. (Still, make one if you can!)
Scottish:
1. Arcade Bar, Haggis & Whisky House (48 Cockburn St): This is a delicious lunch spot. For an easy entrance into the world of haggis, try the haggis nachos. If you are all-in, order the traditional style full plate haggis. Grab a dram of whisky here, too, if you’re feeling it — they have everything. The service is a little slow as they are often understaffed, but it’s such a pleasant atmosphere inside + perfect food that you won’t mind. :)
2. Fish n’ Chips: You’ll have plenty of opportunities for fresh fish n’ chips in the Highlands, so you might not want it in Edinburgh in lieu of other options, but if you do, my only advice is to get it from a small, low-key sort of place you notice somewhere that clearly gets fresh fish every day and not from a pub.
3. The Edinburgh Larder (15 Blackfriars St): simple but locally-sourced, delicious breakfast cafe/deli.
4. Oink (34 Victoria St): This place roasts an entire pig every day and makes these delicious (reasonably sized) sandwiches with various homemade toppings such as sweet potato mash, cranberry sauce, apple sauce, haggis, etc. It’s Matt’s favorite “snack” in Edinburgh.
5. Indigo Yard (7 Charlotte Ln): This place has delicious beers on tap and really impressive food. I guess it’s called a gastropub? The atmosphere is really nice — make a reservation if you can, and if you just show up, they might be able to squeeze you into the garden/bar area.
EDI Cocktails:
There is an underground cocktail place in Edinburgh called Panda & Sons — the outside looks like an old-style barber shop, but if the door’s not already open, just open it and go downstairs (Update: I later learned this is called a Speakeasy 😂) . I’ll let the rest be a surprise. It was recently rated in the top ten for good cocktails in Europe. Weekends can be really packed, but the cocktail will still be perfect every time, and the vibes are always great.
EDI Sweets:
Mary’s Milk Bar. I’m not big on sweets, and I initially thought I was just noticing this place because it has my name on it. But one day, I tried it, and now, I can confidently say it’s one of the few sweet places I would wait in line for — each flavor is a masterpiece! I saw only after I’d been that it made it onto Somebody Feed Phil’s Scotland episode. 💁‍♀️ (Thanks for recommending that show incidentally, sister Ellen!)
EDI Tourist spots:
1. The Castle: You can walk to see the entrance of the castle without paying the fee to get in ($18). It is worth it to go in if you have a free afternoon. It’s not a pop-in experience though. If you go, I would recommend touring half of it, taking a good long break in the cafe, and then touring the rest. There’s just so much to see; it’s all so remarkable; and it’s much more enjoyable at a leisurely pace.
2. Holyrood Palace: I’ve never been inside, but I have been told it is epic.
3. Royal Yacht Britannia: If you have an extra day, I would recommend this option highly. Especially if you are even vaguely swayed by the drama of the royal family (isn’t everyone when it gets right down to it?). If you’ve watched the Crown, book your tickets NOW. It is a big thing to get there if I remember correctly — I think we split a taxi?? — I don’t remember. But if you have the time, I definitely recommend it. If you’re days are limited, it’s not worth missing a day in EDI for though.
4. Calton Hill (at day or night) + graveyards + Arthur’s seat: This is my top recommendation for Edinburgh. Just put on some comfortable shoes and walk around Edinburgh.. follow windy stone streets.. especially the little alleys (which are called “closes”). Get lost. You’re allowed to follow any of the closes that catch your eye. Read about the history of closes if you’re interested. And if you think the history of closes is fascinating…
5. …take a guided tour of the famous, the real, Mary King’s Close. You’ll get the full history of the original design of the city and be able to see it underground, fully preserved from ancient times. (This is the only guided tour I’d recommend, but I’m not really that into guided tours.. I’m sure there are other great ones in Edinburgh, and probably even free ones with various themes.)
6. The Royal Mile: This could be absolutely packed with people in the summertime, so it may be hard to get perspective on the layout with the crowds, but it’s pretty remarkable to see nonetheless. Both amazing and average street performers congregate there, practicing for Fringe season, and there will be hundreds of free shows every day.
7. Live music will be abundant.
8. Grassmarket is a good neighborhood as well for seeing street performers and will be slightly less crowded than the touristy spots of EDI. I also like the Queen Street Gardens neighborhood. The museums close to Queen Street Gardens are both free and have a very impressive art collection.
9. Fringe: If you’re going in August, you will run into the chaos that is the Fringe Festival. Most people from EDI leave for the festival but if you brave it, but you should definitely get ahold of a Fringe magazine when you arrive, even just to see the enormity of the event. I find it pretty overwhelming, actually and ended up just choosing a few highly recommended shows — such as some of the acrobatic ones, comedy shows, burlesque, etc. and then leaving the rest of my time open for walking in and out of free shows. Basically, every single venue in Edinburgh will have a show of some sort. It’s fun for a day or two, but like Vegas, the feeling of awe wears off almost as quickly as it comes.
In general, I’d recommend visiting EDI literally any month besides August.
EDI Lodging:
I would suggest booking a place in EDI in advance — just to be sure you get to stay in a comfortable spot in the center.
My favorite place to stay is actually a hostel called Kickass Hostel. If you’re there with 2–3 people, ask to book a private room with a view of the castle. It’s really amazing — especially if you don’t mind a basic room and shared bathrooms (Update: I’m kind of past the point of sharing bathrooms). But either way, they have a comfy cafe where you can hang out and plan your EDI day.
Or not. Because plans, like the land, are made to be trespassed through in Scotland.

Edinburgh’s decline into a theme park has been charted for years, and the recent victory to Save the People’s Story stands out as an exception against a backdrop of relentless social cleansing, homelessness (the Scottish capital is home to the largest number of people living in temporary accommodation) and culture-washing.
The city’s problems are structural — it is a city of capital rather than a capital city. It’s purpose is hard-wired into its streets and architecture. As William McIlvanney writes in his novel Strange Loyalties, Edinburgh was:
“…built to be a Hanoverian clearing-house of the Scottish identity. The very street names declare what’s happening, like an announcement of government policy in stone: you have Princes Street and George Street and Queen Street with, in among them, Hanover Street and Rose Street and Thistle Street. Any way you count it, the result is the defeat of Scottishness. This was an identity superimposed on the capital of Scotland, an attempted psyche-transplant: ‘Scottishness may have been a life but Britishness can be a career.’
But if Edinburgh’s problems are historic, and symbolic, it is not helped by its current leadership. We know that Cammy Day was forced to resign from his job as leader of the Labour administration in the capital following allegations he had bombarded two Ukrainian refugees with multiple messages on social media. The councillor, who was suspended by his party last weekend, faces a police investigation into claims he acted “inappropriately”.

It is Friday, the beginning of May, my usual morning to write my blog and I’m sitting in a hotel room in Edinburgh, Scotland. The sky is blue and cloudless and the air is a crispy 47°F.
My usual routine back home is placing my computer on the dining room table, quieting my mind and giving thanks while my Doodle Abbey rests at my feet. Today, I sit on a comfy bed with pen and paper. I asked for divine guidance and inspiration.
In response, I hear, “ You are beautiful.”
One of my favorite songs is “ Beautiful” by Gordon Lightfoot, a tune and lyrics that touch my heart. “You are so beautiful. I was made for you and you were made for me.”
Imagine God/Source/our Creator saying to you, my brother Bob, Marilyn, Ann, Alena, Paulette, Michael….all of us “You are beautiful.” Tears fill my eyes and joy fills my heart. Hear the words…. “ I was made for you and you were made for me.”
We are all the same energy made for each other, across continents across lifetimes and realities.
Hold that, feel it. Don’t let anything else in. You, your essence, your light, you, you are beautiful.
How does it feel to walk through your days as “ I am beautiful” versus “I am human, I am flawed, I have issues, blah, blah, blah.”
Try it, now, today, all day, all month. For the month of May, tell yourself I am beautiful.
Look for beauty, everywhere, every day in this month of May and write it down.
“Through rain or shine for such a long time. I’m telling you, you are beautiful.”
You’ve been beautiful since the day you were born and before.
It would mean so much to me if you would experience this. If you would close your eyes, take a deep breath, listen carefully and feel the powerful love given to you by three words “You are beautiful .”
With a smile on my face and joy in my heart, I am off to explore Edinburgh. Enjoy your Friday. Happy May!!

One of the most striking features of Edinburgh is its weather, especially during the autumn and rain season. The misty rain often adds a sense of mystery to the old town, enhancing its fantasy-like appeal. Autumn in Edinburgh brings a palette of rich golds, browns, and reds, with the crisp air carrying the scent of fallen leaves and wet earth. The city’s vintage buildings…

Update: the Principal Edinburgh Charlotte Square hotel is now the Kimpton Charlotte Square. Read the new review here.
With a castle view, a garden room indoors, and a gentleman’s travel collection on display, The Principal Edinburgh Charlotte Square is simply the most remarkable place to stay in New Town.
I blew into the hotel on a gusty early evening unprepared to be immediately charmed by this hotel. But charmed I was. The outside is grand while staying coyly understated. The Principal inhabits seven gorgeous Georgian townhouses and has been fastidiously refurbished with both expected and unexpected details.
Although I loved the masculine entry hall, I was distracted by the restaurant during check-in. Previously an outdoor courtyard, it is now an indoor garden room with a glass ceiling reminiscent of an atrium, draped in hanging ferns and styled with garden furniture. My husband and I enjoyed a full breakfast here both mornings of our stay and noticed happy chatting groups when we came in late in the evening. Another restaurant with a completely different vibe is tucked away at one end of the hotel. BABA serves food with an Eastern Mediterranean flair sprinkled with local staples, such as Scottish beef. At a contrast to The Garden, BABA is dipped in deep greens, reclaimed wood and wool rugs. Its moody evening feel is exciting, even before you see a menu.
Our tour of the room included a story — how Scottish! If The Principal was a person, he’d be Hamish, a gentleman with fine tastes who travels the world looking for the best of it. He’s collected books, textiles and trinkets which he displays on shelves for the pleasure of his guests. Just like the front desk staff, I picture Hamish as friendly and warm — as welcoming as this hotel.
As this was my first time staying at The Principal family of hotels, I was delighted with the complimentary sweets and savory snacks in the tuck box. The red corded telephone by the bedside was adorable as well, adding to the eclectic mix of old and new that works so flawlessly here. I was delighted to see that books are available to borrow from the front desk and hot tea is as easy to find as whisky. Some rooms have the best view in the country, a view of Edinburgh Castle. Even knowing this before I arrived, it was still breathtaking.
If you only have one day in this beguiling city, do these three things within walking distance of the hotel:
1. Visit the most besieged fortress in Great Britain, Edinburgh Castle. Try the Millionaire Shortbread in the café.
2. Tour the homes (now underground) of the average citizen during the time of the plague. I recommend The Real Mary King’s Close Underground Tour.
3. Eat at The Elephant House to absorb the ambience of the place where J.K. Rowling wrote much of the first Harry Potter book.
There’s only one place to stay in Edinburgh with such abundant charms and comforts, The Principal Edinburgh Charlotte Square. My thanks to Simon Willis and Tara D’Agostino for their kind assistance with this story.

Liberal Arts Blog — Sunday is the Joy of Humor, Food, Travel, Practical Life Tips, and Miscellaneous Day
Today’s Topic: Scotland (Part One) A Little Geography, Five Battles, Edinburgh (including the Castle and the Fringe)
Last time, the fourth and final part of a series on the counties of Ireland. Today, on to Scotland, but first a re-cap.
On 2/23 we covered the Dublin of James Joyce and Leopold Bloom, Trinity College, the Ha’penny, Samuel Beckett, and O’Connell bridges, and St. Stephen’s Green, On 2/16 we investigated Northern Ireland including Belfast, the “Peace Walls,” the “Giant’s Causway” and Finn McCool. On 2/9, the central west (Galway, Mayo, Sligo) featuring the Aran jumper, Boycott, and Yeats. On 2/2 the southwest (Cork, Kerry, and Clare) and the stories of Daniel O’Connell (the emancipator of Catholics) and Michael Collins (independence leader who fought in the Easter Rebellion and was assassinated in an ambush at age 31 in 1922).
Now — the land of lochs and firths, of highlands, lowlands, and uplands, of the Shetlands, the Orkneys, and the inner and outer Hebrides, of Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen, of Robert Burns, William
Wallace, James Watt, James Clark Maxwell, Adam Smith, and Andrew Carnegie. And of the great clans — the MacKenzies, the Campbells, the Macleods, Stewarts, Douglases, Sinclairs, Macleans , Wallaces, MacGregors, Fergusons, and Gordons.
Are you Scottish? Have you been? Have you studied or lived there? What do you know about the northern third of island of Great Britain that the rest of us might not but would delight to learn?
Experts — please chime in. Correct, elaborate, elucidate.
GEOGRAPHY AND DEMOGRAPHY — note that firths are coastal inlets (like fjords) and lochs are lakes as in the famous story of the Loch Ness monster and the love song “Loch Lomond”
1. Scotland accounts for roughly a third of the island of Great Britain but has a population of only 5.5 million or about 8% of the United Kingdom. England: 56 million, Wales 3.2 million, Northern Ireland 1.9 million.
2. The border with England is only 92 miles long — as compared to its coastline of 6160 miles.
3. The North Channel separating Scotland from Northern Ireland is only 13 miles wide between the Mull of Kintyre in Scotland and Torr Head in Northern Ireland.
NB: 80% of Scotlands population is in the central lowlands which includes Glasgow (1 million) Edinburgh (half a million), Dunferline, Stirling, Perth, and Dundee.
FIVE HISTORIC BATTLES — Stirling Bridge (1297) Bannockburn (1314), Falkirk (1298), Folloden (1513), Culloden (1746)
1. Stirling Bridge (1297) William Wallace (1270–1305) and Andrew Moray (1265–1297) defeat English. Moray died of wounds from the battle. Wallace was later hanged, drawn, and quartered. Mel Gibson played Wallace in the film “Braveheart” (1995)
2. Bannockburn (1314) Robert Bruce defeats English leading ultimately to Scottish independence in 1328.
3. English victories against the Scots included: Falkirk (1298) Folloden (1513), and Culloden (1746).
The last English monarch to be killed in battle was James IV at the battle of Folloden. The Battle of Culloden ended the Jacobite rebellion which attempted to restore the Stuart monarchy. It was the last pitched battle on British land and resulted in mass evictions from ancestral lands, the banning of the tartan, and the disarming of the people.
EDINBURGH — THE CITY WITH A VOLCANIC PLUG IN THE MIDDLE UPON WHICH STANDS A CASTLE AND LEADING UP TO IT “THE ROYAL MILE” THROUGH THE “OLD TOWN” — have you been to the Edinburgh Fringe?
1. Edinburgh is bounded to the north side by the Firth of Forth and to the south side by the Pentland Hills.
2. “Recognized as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is the seat of the Scottish Government, the Scottish Parliament, the highest courts in Scotland, and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official residence of the monarch in Scotland.”
3. “The city has long been a centre of education, particularly in the fields of medicine, Scottish law, literature, philosophy, the sciences and engineering. The University of Edinburgh, founded in 1582 and now one of three in the city, is considered one of the best research institutions in the world. The financial center of Scotland, Edinburgh is the second-largest financial centre in the United Kingdom, the fourth largest in Europe, and the thirteenth largest internationally.”
NB: The Edinburgh Fringe is the “world’s largest performance arts festival which in 2024 spanned 25 days, sold more than 2.6 million tickets and featured more than 51, 446 scheduled performances of 3,746 different shows across 262 venues from 60 different countries. Of those shows, the largest section was comedy, representing 40% of shows, followed by theater, which was 26.6% of shows.” (see below)

Many years ago, I became the proud supervisor of not one, not two, but THREE PhD students and a part-time research assistant. Hurray me — I had a lab!
Now, clearly the word “lab” conjures images of test tubes and centrifuges, pipettes and petri dishes. Our research group has none of these things. But over time, the group of people associated with a given principal investigator (like me) and their shared resources (in our case, bubble guns and laptops rather than beakers and lab coats) has come to be known as a lab in a lot of scientific disciplines.
For us, the concept of the lab means a group of people who take an interest in each other’s work, help each other out when we’re stuck, and share ideas, resources and office space. We have a Code of Conduct to help set clear expectations for members of the group, and meet monthly to swap our latest news. Twice a year we have a half-day away day, sometimes focused on professional development and sometimes on just hanging out and having fun. Last autumn we had a session on writing a thesis and preparing for viva, but the most recent one included a foraging walk and then board games in a cafe!
My first challenge when deciding that my little team qualified as a lab group, was to come up with a name. I went to the pub with my husband and wrote down a series of keywords that described the work we were doing, and then saw which of these could be combined into a satisfactory and pronounceable acronym. And lo! DART was born — standing for development, autism, research, technology. Of course, I could have gone down the well-trodden path of the “Fletcher-Watson Lab” but honestly… *shudders*
Fast forward almost a decade and DART no longer seems like a suitable name for our little gang. “Research” has always bothered me as a keyword — I mean, obviously, we are researchers. “Autism” feels too narrow for what we do nowadays, which has a much broader focus on developmental diversity and trying to do work which is relevant and useful for multiple diagnosed and undiagnosed people. And it’s been a few years since I last did a project I could call “technology”.
So back to the drawing board, but roughly the same technique… Collectively we suggested words and — in a stroke of luck — this time we managed to organise them into an acronym that works for our largely-psychological research: MIND for mental health, interaction, neurodiversity, development. MIND though — there’s an awful lot of organisations out there with MIND as a name. That didn’t seem a good idea on its own, so Edinburgh MIND then?? Or maybe, there’s a chance to be clever and insert one more keyword into it all…
And so, the Edinburgh Inclusive MIND lab it is, or EdInMIND for short.
Nowadays this group has a rolling cast of about 10–16 members, as grant funding waxes and wanes. It is co-led by me and my close colleague, Catherine Crompton. While Catherine and I are both part of the Salvesen Mindroom Research Centre, our lab group is diverse and spans multiple parts of the University of Edinburgh — members may have a primary affiliation in the Division of Psychiatry, School of Philosophy Psychology and Language Sciences, Child Life and Health, Centre for Reproductive Health or Moray House School of Education and Sport. This diversity of perspective is one reason why we feel it’s important to have a lab identity which reflects our shared focus.
If you want to find out more about what we’re up to, the best gateway will be on this page where we link out to more specific projects and information — and back here, if you fancy going in a circle!

When I stepped foot in Edinburgh a few decades ago, I immediately fell in love with the place. That first sight of the city will never leave me, and I still adore how it holds its head high. Along with being beautiful, it is a highly educated and cultured city and has more graduates as a percentage than virtually any other place on the planet. It also hosts world-class innovation and research. While its infrastructure is never at a scale that the mighty London can achieve in terms of innovation, it is livable, walkable, and a fairly safe place to live.
In the city, I feel the ghosts of the past and of the great scientists, academics, business leaders and engineers who helped build the city and the country. This city, a few hundred years ago, showed the world how to take an enlightened approach to science and knowledge creation. In my university, too, I get to walk through John Napier’s Tower, and have the chance to convert his logarithms into something that provides the core of the security of the Internet — discrete logarithms.
And, for my PhD, I studied the work of James Clerk-Maxwell, and who’s created a unified theory for electromagnetic waves.
And, so, today, I am honoured to be elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE) [here], and share a space with those who have truly advanced Scotland as a country. As you should possibly know, Scotland has a long track record for punching above its weight in terms of invention and enterprise. Current fellows include many great scientists and engineers who have made Scotland their home, such as Peter Higgs and Jocelyn Bell Burnell. Former fellows include James Clerk-Maxwell and James Watt, along with the inventor of the TV:
And I love the entry for Benjmin Franklin, ad who is “interested in Electricity”:
But, for me, the mightiest of all, and possibly one of the greatest scientists of all time is James-Clerk Maxwell:
As you can see he was born in Edinburgh, and studied at the Edinburgh Academy and at the University of Edinburgh. After he graduated, he became a Professor at Aberdeen University, and then onto Kings College and Cambridge.
Education has given me everything in my career. For those starting out in their career, my core advice is to advance your education as much as you can, and achieve your full potential. No matter your background, if you have a desire to succeed, you will in the end. In fact, never stop learning, and advance yourself every single day. And don’t just learn from a superficial point-of-view; dive in and learn things deeply. If you can, read up on the classic research paper that built your field and understand the current barriers that need to be broken down. Research is great fun and can have a great impact … so go make a dent in this world (Steve Jobs quote). So, go do that MSc or PhD that you have always wanted to do.
This city and this country have given me everything that I would ever want in my career. They have helped shape our research and teaching, and they have been there to support us in building up collaborations, in supporting partnerships, and in allowing us the space to grow. To share a space that James-Clerk Maxwell once occupied is a privilege I will never forget. I am so lucky, too, as I get to research and teach the subjects that I love (cryptography and cybersecurity) and teach students who will build our future.

An Edinburgh Christmas Ghost Story — tales from the graveyards of the Necropolis of the North,https://medium.com/@DuncanHynd/an-edinburgh-christmas-ghost-story-tales-from-the-graveyards-of-the-necropolis-of-the-north-61a8d7150fb6,"Sign up

Our dead are never dead to us until we have forgotten them — George Eliot.
In the dark corners of the burial grounds of early 19th Century Edinburgh, the Necropolis of the North as I like to call it, two entrepreneurial men met a rapidly rising demand for human bodies to be used for anatomical dissection. Using human remains for medical research was illegal in the UK and banned in much of Europe or extremely limited for what were largely religious reasons.
To that end and to practice their surgical skills and enhance their anatomical knowledge doctors were only allowed to dissect bodies of executed criminals, people deceased in prison and oddly, orphans or people who had died with no fixed abode. As medical schools became more common, the supply and demand for dead bodies exceeded a state of economic equilibrium and so people resorted to body snatching or when that resource dried up, murder — to keep the cold medical school mortuary shelves and marble slabs well stocked.
Step forward William Burke and William Hare!
At the time Edinburgh was the leading European city for anatomical research and so the aptly named ‘resurrection men’ robbed fresh graves of their homo sapiens contents until relatives decided to take matters into their own hands and essentially lock the grave and coffin shut using what were termed ‘mort-safes’ of which some fine examples still exist in the infamous Greyfriars Kirkyard and others. These enclosed the grave, tomb or mausoleum in heavy duty wrought iron bars and locks, that even todays gangs that run around London with battery powered angle grinders to steal expensive bikes would struggle to cut open. The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh is still famed the world over as a leading surgical training today but by physically locking up the dead within their individual burial chamber, the supply of corpses rapidly dried up.
Out of interest, Surgeons’ Hall in Edinburgh, is the headquarters of the aforementioned Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and houses the Surgeons’ Hall Museum with anatomical displays and surgical equipment which is well worth a visit when you’re in town. There is also a library and archive of the colleges work.
The present Surgeons’ Hall was designed by Edinburgh’s leading light architect William Henry Playfair and completed in 1832, and is a category A listed structure while Playfair will feature in my tales of Edinburgh graveyards shortly and so please don’t change channels just yet!
The museum is recognised as a collection of national significance by the Scottish Government and very popular with tourists and locals alike.
Measures to ensure graves were left undisturbed, such as the use of mort-safes (I did research deadlock and mortice lock for this piece but there is no evidence that the etymological beginning of these names are at all linked to the subject matter but they sound like they should be) only made the shortage of cadavers even worse and so the indigenous vagrant population quickly became lambs to the slaughter and all for a princely sum of around £7 which would be worth around £1,000 today and so not to be ‘sniffed’ at.
When the New Calton Burial Ground was built as an overspill and operational replacement to the Old Calton Burial Ground just half a mile to its east on Regent Road due to Waterloo Place being built, a special watchtower was built, specifically to stop people grave robbing, such was the commercial opportunity on offer!
The murders started after a tenant in one of Hare’s properties died suddenly and the pair sold the body to Dr Robert Knox who was a celebrated lecturer of anatomy and a zoologist, ethnologist and medical doctor in the city and who had established the above-mentioned museum of anatomy and pathology. Another lodger, suffering from a cold was killed for literally sniffing too much and putting off other potential tenants from renting rooms and so the murders continued with the tacit approval of Burkes wife and Hare’s partner and no doubt partly to support their increasingly extravagant and expensive lifestyle. They were caught when the body of Margaret Docherty was discovered who was suspected to have been suffocated but at that time, no one could prove this.
Hare was granted immunity from prosecution and so by way of the use of Kings evidence he provided the details of Docherty’s murder and confessed to all sixteen deaths colloquially known then as the West Port Murders while charges were laid against Burke and his wife for three of the deaths.
At trial Burke was found guilty of just one murder and sentenced to death. The case against his wife was found not proven. Burke was hanged shortly afterwards and his cadaver was dissected and his skeleton displayed at the anatomical museum of the Edinburgh Medical School.
Robert Knox was never charged with his connection to the murders despite public outcry but his reputation in Edinburgh was irreparably damaged and so in time the Royal College of Surgeons forced him to resign as the curator of their anatomical museum.
The Burke and Hare case hugely raised public awareness of the need for cadavers for medical research and contributed to the passing of the Anatomy Act of 1832 that gave surgeons and students legal access to bodies from workhouses, hospitals and prisons that were unclaimed 48 hours after death. It was also made possible for a person to donate a next of kin’s body for medical research. It was essentially ratified in response to public outrage at the illegal trade in corpses.
The Arthur’s Seat 17 small coffins discovery
Robert Louis Stevenson died in 1894 and is buried on Mount Vaea, its summit overlooking Apia, the capital of Samoa. Many years before he died, he composed his own epitaph — ‘Under the wide and starry sky, Dig the grave and let me lie. Glad did I live and gladly die, and I laid me down with a will’.
Stevenson, as we know was a world-renowned Scottish novelist and is best known for Treasure Island, The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Kidnapped among many other books, poems, essays and travel guides. The son of Thomas Stevenson and grandson of Robert, a family famed for building lighthouses and other civil engineering feats suggested that he acquired his love of writing from his mother’s side of the family, the Balfours. His alma mater was Edinburgh University and while his paternal family were reticent about him taking on a life as a wordsmith and not an engineer, the rest as they say is history aside from the equally ‘strange case’ of 17 tiny coffins.
In June 1836, a group of boys were rabbiting on Arthur’s Seat, when they came across a small cave on the North East side, its entry covered by a stone and inside they found 17 miniature wooden coffins along with some tiny, carved figures clothed in delicate but bespoke outfits. These are now on show at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.
It has been mooted many times that these coffins are in some way a memorial to the 16 victims of Burke and Hare and as Burke was hanged in 1829 that made 17 deaths and indeed 17 coffins, others suggest they’re linked to some form of witchcraft.
However, in 2014, the museum was sent a package containing another small coffin with a small body with an accompanying note containing a long quote from Robert Louis Stevenson’s work — The Body Snatchers, which was part inspired by the Burke and Hare murders. Spooky indeed!
Greyfriars Bobby and the ghostly kirkyard.
There is no doubt that the most ‘popular’ graveyard in the Auld Reekie is at Greyfriars Kirk and probably because of a certain pet dog and not a famous human being although being what some term ‘the most haunted place in Edinburgh’ does get the tourists flooding in and it’s all for free as our all the main galleries and museums in this great, but increasingly ‘Disneyfied’ city.
The existing church on the site was built in 1602, and people have been buried here before then, including James Hutton, who famously stated that ‘we find no vestige of a beginning — no prospect of an ending’ and was part of Edinburgh’s period of ‘Enlightenment’. He realised that the earth was far older than current religious beliefs of the time allowed for and spoke out about this despite having to defer to the status quo and John Porteous, who was the drill master of Edinburgh’s city guard. When an infamous smuggler was hung in 1736, people rioted and he was given an order to shoot over them but as things worsened, he asked the soldiers to fire on the mob, killing many. He was charged, imprisoned at the Tollbooth, captured by the angry throng and then lynched, ending up buried at Greyfriars a day later. You can read more about this in my blog that features ‘Heart of Midlothian’ by Walter Scott which features this historic event and local football team the Jam Tarts and also my boyhood heroes Spurs.
From Waverley to White Hart Lane:
https://medium.com/@DuncanHynd/from-waverley-to-white-hart-lane-d083327faa2b
Rumour has it that it could be the most haunted graveyard in the world and is named after a Franciscan Friary located on the site but no longer stands there and aside from the above famous people interred also contains the burial places of some grave robbers too.
One angry, even violent apparition that has been allegedly seen and heard by late night revellers, legend has it is a certain George MacKenzie who was a tormentor of a religious group of 17th-century Presbyterians. Apparently, his ghostly form was freed when a tramp broke into his tomb and he has been on the rampage ever since.
Another often mentioned Greyfriars spectre is that of Edinburgh surgeon James Borthwick who died in 1675 and who bizarrely by today’s standards was the initial teacher of anatomy in a special society of barbers and surgeons! I guess this makes sense as both used sharp instruments to either shave people or operate on them or both if they wanted them dead and likely where the name cut throat razor came from!
A member of the Scottish Parliament, Borthwick was responsible for the creation of the ‘Surgeon-Apothecary’ group in Edinburgh as he served his internship as what would be a modern day pharmacist initially and was then incorporated as a surgeon unusually without first having served a surgical apprenticeship but as the city had been gripped by the plague, membership levels where very low. His speciality was as an anatomy teacher to student surgeons when human dissection was a much needed but often dark art.
By way of an Edinburgh council remit in 1657, the Surgeon- Apothecary group were granted permission to work on patients as until then the surgeons and apothecaries had completely different areas of practice.
Borthwick died in 1676 and is buried in this infamous grave yard, his monument adorned with a life size, crazy, dancing skeleton carrying a scythe in the style of Father Time, a royal crown and the skull and cross bones, with an array of surgical devices displayed on the sides!
James Hutton the geologist mentioned above is buried in desecrated land that was once the ‘Covenantor’s Prison’ that held circa 1,200 prisoners in around 1679, people who were so called militant Presbyterians and believed in what was known as the National Covenant and whom George MacKenzie, representing the Crown but in his human form, persecuted. Some simply died in the grounds, some were executed for treason, some escaped, and some were freed after signing a bond of loyalty to the Crown and shipped via the Port O’Leith to the US.
If you like Harry Potter, Tom Riddell’s villainous monument is located here too.
The graveyard is famously, from a tourist’s perspective, forever associated with the legend of Greyfriars Bobby, a dog who guarded his dead owner’s grave for 14 years and who has a burial headstone at the entrance. There is a statue and water fountain of Bobby, whose brass nose is now very worn out at the corner of Edinburgh’s Candlemaker Row and George IV Bridge and ridiculously popular for selfies as shown above.
Depending on the narrative you believe, and there are quite a few the dog was either a Skye Terrier or a Dandie Dinmont, who died on 14 January 1872. The best-known variation is that Bobby belonged to John Gray, who worked for the Edinburgh City Police as a night-watchman, with Bobby his formal watch-dog. Gray, under other popular pseudonyms was a farmer, a gardener or other!
Lastly, the churchyard has claimed the burial of other historic figures such as Scottish architect William Adam, its first famous post humous occupant how famously designed Hopetoun House near Edinburgh and Duff House, very close to where I live out the spring and summer months in Banff on the Moray Firth to William Wright, who was a Scottish physician, botanist, infamously part of the slave trade and joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
The leading architect of Edinburgh’s iconic buildings and graves gave his named to a popular pub too!
William Henry Playfair who infamously has a Wetherspoons pub named after him on Piccardy Place by the Vue cinema complex as a posthumous badge of honour was both a leading designer of landmark buildings and largely big-statement and non-conformist tombs in the Auld Reekie, mainly found in the remarkable Dean Cemetery, located high above the Water of Leith and the tourist hotspot that is Dean Village.
Born in 1790, Playfair died in 1857 and is buried in the same grave yard where some of his best work can be seen such as his pink pyramid tomb that inters Lady Sophia Rutherford and her husband Andrew Rutherford who was, among other illustrious jobs, the Lord Advocate of Scotland. His wife, Sophia Stewart died in 1852 where after Playfair built one of the most amazing memorials I have ever seen. The photograph below shows this and is in a line of tombs aptly named The Lord’s Row! His own memorial and the one to Lord Jeffrey are also worth a visit too. Francis Jeffrey qualified as a lawyer and was one of the co-founders of the influential magazine, the Edinburgh Review. He was editor, then became a politician and also the Lord Advocate.
His links to Burke and Hare are tenuous at best but it was he that designed the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh building where the surgeon Robert Knox worked and where he purchased the bodies.
He also was the architect behind the National Gallery of Scotland, the Old College at the University of Edinburgh and the Royal Scottish Academy along with what was termed the east or third New Town and many other Edinburgh neoclassical land marks. The old, steep steps that lead from the top of the Mound, down to the National Gallery are called the ‘Playfair Steps’ in his honour.
Born in London, his father was also an architect and shortly after his death he was sent to Edinburgh to be educated by his uncle John Playfair, usefully a famous mathematician. His alma mater was the University of Edinburgh and after graduating he joined the team of celebrated architect William Stark and eventually joined the Freemasons.
William Playfair died in Edinburgh in 1857, and is also buried in the Lord’s Row on the western edge where he designed monuments for others as shown above.
Since his death and completed in 2004 ‘The Playfair Project’ joined by tunnel the two separate buildings making up the National Galleries and then most recently the southern building has undergone an amazing £38m transformation, with a huge new subterranean section built into the Mound and exiting onto Princes Street gardens with stunning views over Waverley and the old Nor Loch that showcases the very best of Scottish art, with Landseer’s Monarch of the Glen holding court in its new resting place on a huge wall at the end the new building.
While walking around Dean Cemetery recently, located high above Dean Village, sited on the banks of the Water of Leith, I came across the grave of Edinburgh artist John Bellany, noted for his almost impressionist or expressionist, stylised portrait paintings of Scottish icons such as Billy Connolly and Sean Connery, created in the early 90s. Connolly’s portrait called ‘The Entertainer’ is currently not on display but the one of Connery is still exhibited in the National Portrait Gallery today. Once you have seen a Bellany image, you will instantly always know when you see one again.
On the subject of Connolly and Connery, aside from being famous Scottish thespians and having portraits painted by Bellany, at a BAFTA ceremony in 1999, Billy was due to present Sean with a life time achievement award but couldn’t make the event and so over a live TV link from the US said to all the guests present and Connery and his wife ‘You’ve done awfully well for a man with a speech defect’ and ended ‘congratulations baldy, I wish I had your money!’. Praise indeed. Connery died in 2020 and the whole of Scotland will be in mourning when Connolly meets his maker and would pay good money to hear what he says to him.
Bellany was born in Port Seaton in Edinburgh and much of his work has the sea as a main theme which often diverges into his own psyche or human form. Other well-known images merge human and animal forms, often painted in an overtly menacing style, However, his portraits of well-known people such as Connolly, Connery and Ian Botham are the most recognisable for me especially with regards to the colour palette used. His painting style calmed down when he was diagnosed with cancer later in life and he died in 2013 aged 71. When in Edinburgh, it’s well worth looking out for his unique, contemporary works.
Sean Connery’s ashes were scattered in St Andrews.
Below are the two paintings in question and my own photographs from the Edinburgh galleries when they were on show and exhibited to the public.
Beware the Weeping Angels
The Seafield cemetery in Edinburgh, located beside the now defunct Restalrig Railway, a cycle trail and footpath between Leith and the long sandy beach at Portobello is well worth a walk around. Some of the memorials are seemingly straight out of a series of Dr Who.
For lifelong fans like me, the ‘Weeping Angels’ were really scary, ghost like alien creatures in the form of an angel who were introduced in 2007 and that if you blinked, the angel would be able to very rapidly move much closer to you and the end game being that if they can reach out and touch you then you’re sent back in time to a life of purgatory. They are unable to move while being watched by anyone living, including oddly themselves and are turned to stone when an eye is glanced upon them and so the angel below is quite a good representation, especially on a cold, dark day! When stone like, they cannot be harmed.
The then writer and creator Steven Moffat reckons that they are the most popular and frightening foe of the Doctor in that any stone statue could be one, but he would say that wouldn’t he. For me the Daleks and Cybermen will never be bettered but I am over sixty now!
They do really resemble female stone statues in the form of winged angels with draped robes that you might find in a Victorian graveyard like Seafield. However, as they move in closer to you they show off vampire like teeth and clawed fingers and in some episode they even had ‘babies’ that resembled demonic cherubs that laughed and made rather loud footsteps!
Weeping Angels can’t look at each other nor in a mirror and so shield their eyes to avoid paralysis, which is where they get their name from as it looks like they’re weeping but have the ability to send you back in time to an age when you didn’t exist or will ever exist. The resulting forces from this is their life blood.
There are many more nuances but we’ll leave that there!
The Scottish Enlightenment, in a very brief nutshell!
An amalgamation of free minds, ideas and publications was centred in particular in Edinburgh and also over Scotland generally during the second half of the 18th century and for decades prior to and after that. It was a movement of ideas and the debate of those ideas and in philosophy, the two men most prominent were David Hume and Adam Smith.
Edinburgh was then described as hotbed of genius while Voltaire wrote in 1762 rather contentiously that ‘today it is from Scotland that we get rules of taste in all the arts, from epic poetry to gardening’.
David Hume, a leading light in the movement was a philosopher, historian and economist who was best known for his influential beliefs in ‘empiricism, philosophical skepticism and metaphysical naturalism’ which is a view which holds that there is nothing but natural elements, principles, and relations of the type studied by the natural sciences and denies the existence of a transcendent God. Philosophical skepticism is an important form of scepticism in that it rejects knowledge claims that seem certain from the perspective of common sense.
Empiricism is the theory that all knowledge is based on experience derived from the senses and created by those who doubted the possibility of acquiring any knowledge beyond that of the contents of directly felt experience. He believed that ethics were based on emotion and sentiment rather than one’s moral compass.
His mantra that making lives better by finding differentiation between morality, religion, ethics, and society was critical to his ideas but hugely controversial for the time. Hume held that passions rather than reason rule the human psyche saying that ‘Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions’.
His philosophy of religion, as with Hutton’s view on Geology included a rejection of miracles and the existence of a creator God, were especially controversial for their time and where being outspoken on such issues was sometimes dangerous and considered blasphemous, something we need to be careful not to repeat today.
His most famous line was that: ‘The life of man is of no greater importance to the universe than that of an oyster’.
Adam Smith was a social philosopher and a political economist while David Hume and Smith were very close friends.
Smith famously said that ‘Labour was the first price, the original purchase-money that was paid for all things. It was not by gold or by silver, but by labour, that all wealth of the world was originally purchased.’
He believed that wealth is created by hard work and self-interest. Smith’s suggestions that economies that are based on free markets, competition and capitalism are still the bedrock of economics and growth today.
As the self-styled father of economics, he wrote the book ‘Wealth of Nations’ and also suggested that ‘Goods can serve many other purposes besides purchasing money, but money can serve no other purpose besides purchasing goods. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from regard to their own interest’.
Hume died in 1776 and Smith in 1790
Hume is interred at the Old Calton Hill burial ground, just off Waterloo Place in a round, tower like tomb as shown above with a locked gate to keep out the grave robbers while Smith’s body lies in the Canongate Kirkyard close to Holyrood and he has a statue on the Royal Mile.
And finally, Sir Henry Raeburn Scotland’s finest painter…arguably
Raeburn was born Stockbridge, just north of the city centre of Edinburgh and is depending whom you talk to is arguably the best known of all Scottish painters and is buried in St Cuthbert’s churchyard, located at the west end of Princes Street and across the road from the Caledonian Hotel. His formal portraits are instantly recognisable, with legends such as Sir Walter Scott, part of his prolific portfolio, just pay a visit to the National Portrait Gallery on Queen Street to find out!
He actually commissioned and installed his monument and grave at St Cuthbert’s well before he died in 1823, hence including him in my story.
However, perhaps the most famous painting accredited to him and I say that advisedly, may well not be by him at all and is not really a recognised portrait either.
The Reverend Dr Robert Walker skating on Duddingston Loch or colloquially known as ‘The Skating Minister’ was acquired by the National Galleries of Scotland in 1949 for a song and is one of their most popular paintings both to view and as part of its merchandise offering and so they are not going to give up on its provenance despite many believing that Henri-Pierre Danloux, a French immigrant who was based in Scotland at the time, was the painter. Some say that Raeburn simply painted the face and not the majestic motions of the holy man on the ice.
In Michelle Sloan’s great book ‘The Edinburgh Skating Club’ she takes a ‘novel’ approach to the painting’s narrative where her main character Alison Cockburn, who was employed and friends with the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume whom we’ve met above, colludes with his sister, Katherine Hume to live as a man so as to become a member of the prestigious and men only club.
In a coincidental nod to the toxicity of gender reform politics in Scotland these days whereby it was stated that you could self-certify as a woman after a few months of simply deciding to be one, this makes for a remarkably contemporary novel but one full of local historic Edinburgh landmarks, characters and times past.
The background story is set in modern times and catalogues an art historian’s efforts to attribute the work to Danloux and ‘out’ the outlandish fact that Rev Walker might just have been a woman about to win a very big, life changing bet! It’s a great read and a good whodunnit.
Raeburn at the age of 28 moved to London where he met and was hugely inspired by portraitist Joshua Reynolds returning to Edinburgh in 1787 where he started to paint portraits of the Auld Reekie’s rich and famous and was hugely sought after and successful despite being largely self-taught.
He was knighted in 1822 just a year before he died and shortly thereafter was appointed His Majesty’s Limner for Scotland. A limner is an illuminator of manuscripts, or more generally, a painter of ornamental decoration.
Raeburn was especially well known in Scotland as the outstanding portrait painter of members of the Scottish Enlightenment and probably painted in excess of 225 acknowledged pieces.
When the Leith based shipping business, Henry Raeburn and Company, collapsed at the end of 1807, he was declared bankrupt and was left to paint portraits and act as a property developer to pay off creditors for the rest of his life.
His painting of Walter Scott in 1822 was one of Raeburn’s undoubted highlights, someone who also was left bankrupt by a series of poor business decisions and overspending. Later in life he chased warmer weather in Italy by way of a lift on a UK naval frigate but suffered a stroke on his way home, he died in 1832 at Abbotsford, where he is buried. The portrait shows Scott deep in thought at the height of his writing career.
Raeburn’s self-portrait was designed to project himself as the premier painter in the land especially to his peers down in London and painted this as his diploma picture for entry into London’s Royal Academy. He painted in York Place in a New Town house that had large north facing windows and special shutters to create the ultimate conditions for is work. He never made it back to London to paint and died in 1823 and is buried in his chosen resting place at St Cuthbert’s kirkyard at the very west end of Princes Street gardens.
I ain’t afraid of no ghosts — The Ghostbusters song
For me, I’m a great proponent of the new assisted dying law and hope that it becomes part of the statute soon, just as a back stop for those so ill, they can’t bear it any longer. I’ll have a ‘pure cremation’, whereby without any fuss, they take me away in a black bin bag, return me in an urn and I get chucked out into the Moray Firth!
If it was mandatory to have an epitaph I would go for Clement Freud’s idea when he said before he died…it will simply bear my name, and then the date of my death beneath the words ‘best before’.
I don’t believe in ghosts but I wouldn’t want to spend a night alone in Greyfriars, it is a cold, dark and scary place but if graveyards are your thing, the Necropolis of the North or the Auld Reekie is well worth a visit.
I prefer the Cullen Pet cemetery near my home in Moray where I find the messages of love for lost pets far more moving and relevant to me, however in the past stupid EU rules closed it down, but after Brexit, people can once again bury pets themselves and say whatever they like about them.
Go see!

Or what the world’s biggest arts festival taught Leith planner, Claire Wood, about how to be better at her job.
Every August, Edinburgh hosts the biggest arts festival in the world. This year’s Fringe boasted over 55,000 performances of over 3,500 shows. Interestingly, it featured more shows about ‘social issues’ than previous years.
As someone who works for an ad agency and so spends a good portion of her time thinking about social issues and how advertising can persuade people to change harmful habits, I was curious to explore whether you can do the same with theatre. After all, the shortest show I saw this year lasted less than eight minutes. And even eight minutes gives you a better crack at encouraging people to change than a 30 second ad.
Of course, the context is different. Usually (though the Royal Mile in the Fringe is an exception), you actively choose a piece of theatre where you might bump into advertising content. And you usually plump for a particular production because some aspect of it appeals — the creative team, the topic, the actors. Few people actively seek out advertising as a reflection of their world view. (Is last week’s Nike campaign an honourable exception? Discuss.)
But assuming both do their jobs right, whether advertiser or theatre maker, both are creating content that they hope their audience will want to discover. So can we learn anything from theatre makers about how best to persuade people to change their ways? I think so — as follows:
Sometimes, the reasons you might want to behave differently are obvious. Most people now accept that it’s good to wear seatbelts when you’re driving and it’s bad to smoke, for example. But often, in order to persuade people to consider change — or disrupting a pattern — it helps if they understand the context, or the reasons why change is good.
Closed Doors was a quick-witted feisty piece of theatre by Glasgow performance poet, Belle Jones in collaboration with Novasound. Following a Police evacuation of a Glasgow tenement, three women from very different backgrounds are forced to confront the assumptions they’ve made about each other. Topical in these times of terrorist threats, firebombs and foiled plots, Jones’ message — that we should judge less and talk to each other more — is beautifully delivered.
From one woman’s story to another. Earlier this year, the Scottish Government passed a bill that recognised that domestic abuse isn’t only physical; it can also be psychological. ‘Coercive control’ will soon be easier to prosecute though the law will rely on victims coming forward to seek help.
Never Vera Blue was a devastating study of a woman trapped in an abusive relationship. Developed in partnership with the Gaia Centre in Lambeth, the peculiar ways in which coercive control can be exercised were thoroughly explored and the protagonist found a way out. Easy to say but not so easy to do.
By showing an understanding of the peculiar individual misery of an abusive relationship — and then dramatising an escape, Futures Theatre hope to both raise awareness of the problem, of how insidious and invidious coercive control can be and to inspire more people to take action.
2. Showing can help — but sometimes you have to tell
The Half Moon Shania briefly touched on a topic close to our client Drinkaware’s heart: sexual harassment in the night time economy. The musical explored a female punk band’s attempts to hit the big time in an industry all too ready to take advantage of wannabes. Burnt Lemon Theatre had ample opportunity (and didn’t really take it) to land a message about how you could behave if you see someone being harassed on a night out — but then they were making a piece of theatre, not a self-help manual.
At the other end of the spectrum were a bunch of shows that had a very explicit call to action. Part of Death on the Fringe, both User Not Found and Sit With Us For A Moment And Remember took on the tricky topic of grief. At Dante Or Die’s User Not Found, the audience listened to most of the play through headphones but were asked to take them off for the final scene —emphasising the importance of human contact. And I don’t want to ruin the climactic moment of Lincoln Company’s Sit With Us… to be found on a park bench overlooking Edinburgh’s extinct volcano but it was a beautiful reminder of the importance of being there for people.
Both, by building empathy — or at least intrigue in the case of Sit With Us — left a more lingering impression than a poster might.
3. Advocacy is as much as we can hope for
Beyond actually getting people to do the thing you hope they’ll do (CPR! Joining the organ donor register!), urging them to talk about it with friends and family can also be helpful to raise awareness and start to shift attitudes. With organ donation, it’s vital as consent is everything.
Leo Burtin’s The Midnight Soup is intended to do exactly that. As well as having one of the Fringe’s smartest marketing strategies — a ticket for his show also includes your dinner.
Under the auspices of talking about his grandmother’s unexplained suicide, Burtin invites a small audience to help him make soup. As we chop, he tells us about his gran, using her sudden death as a prompt for his audience to discuss their own attitudes towards and preparations for their own end of life care.
The experience of preparing food together, Burtin explained afterwards, helps break down a typically British awkwardness and encourages conversation. The Fringe was a temporary stop off. He’s more usually found taking the show to community centres and care homes — his soup cooker is portable!
Interesting for us advertisers as our field and experiential activity is usually intended to do something similar. We often rely on visual eye candy to attract people to the stand — and then field staff to convey our message. Maybe we need to be thinking harder about how we involve our audiences in the debate.
4. Empathy is everything
Whether we’re trying to persuade people to do an icky bowel cancer test or to drink a little bit less alcohol, we need to show that we understand our audience. Telling without sympathy and / or empathy is only lecturing. And who ever has responded well to that?
And maybe that’s where theatre has the advantage. You’ve bought a ticket for a show — and thereby given permission to whoever it is to talk at you for the next fifty minutes. Where we’re trying to persuade people to take time out of their to do lists and pay attention to us for a frantic thirty second slot. Poor us.
But we could also learn that with enough energy, creativity and vitally, ability to listen, it’s easy (easier, anyway) to empathise with your audience. I’ll Have What She’s Having was a cracking insight into what it is to be young, female, trying your best to have it all but buckling under the pressures of needing to be seen to have a perfect life on social media. Grassmarket Projects’ Where It Hurts looked at the NHS in its seventieth year. A homage to its collective grace and tenacity and a yowl of frustration at escalating demand, it reminded us that lots of health issues can’t be set in plaster and left to heal.
Aside from being a stunning show — I’m eternally grateful to David Amers for telling me at least three times that it was the best thing he’d seen this Fringe — Electrolyte by Wildcard was a stunning study of mental ill-health and the power of friends to help you through. You can read all the books you like about the disorientation, discombobulation, isolation and fear that goes with mental health problems but this young company turned all of that into an hour and ten minutes of gripping, glorious story-telling. Wildcard deliberately set out to give the “unknown and disenfranchised” a voice, thereby empowering them to take action. And Electrolyte does just that, with literal bells on.
And maybe that’s why the Edinburgh Fringe is a little bit like crack cocaine for me. Three weeks, 3,500 shows in a city that’s barely built to cope and every time you step off the street into another dim cavern, you’re bumping up against someone else’s little slice of life in all its unapologetic, fierce, feisty glory. Stories worm their way into your mind and your heart in a way that a textbook will always struggle to do. It might make for an empathy overload. But it’s also a greedy planner’s dream.

When arriving in Edinburgh, Scotland, I had little to no expectations for this trip. With finals being so close to leaving, I didn’t feel I had the time to research these places. I thought the city was beautiful, as I’ve never seen anything like it before. The architecture was amazing, I have never seen so many Gothic buildings. My time here left me with so many beautiful photos. Something I didn’t expect to see here though, was little to no local people! I had no clue that most people who live here are not from the area.
After experiencing the beautiful city of Edinburgh, Scotland, I fully expected Dublin, Ireland, to be very similar. Instead, Dublin was so vivid when I arrived, the city felt more alive than Edinburgh. When comparing them, I would say Edinburgh is like a small tourist town. While Dublin has the tourist town feeling with all of the gift shops, there is so much more to it! I noticed just walking the streets of Dublin I saw so many restaurants and shops I wanted to go back to. The area we went to in Scotland felt almost too geared towards tourists, as a majority of the stores there had the exact same items.
In Dublin, I saw more attractions, retail stores, and restaurants in between…

Last week I was trundling down Leith Walk’s infamous cycle lane and realised that I was having a deeply unpleasant time.
It’s wasn’t the ongoing threat of HGV drivers mounting the kerb, or drivers blasting through STOP signs at the junctions, or having to swerve around the pedestrians squeezed into the cycle lane by the preposterously narrow pavements.
No. It was the dreadful surface quality. Despite a warning from Spokes, the cycling advocacy group, the entirety of this critical active travel route has been hand laid, meaning that while drivers enjoy a beautifully smooth surface on the carriageway, cyclists have to put up with buckarooing their way down the Walk.
This was something worth quantifying, in the hope that the same mistake won’t be made again. Deploying the in-built accelerometer on my phone, I set out to test the primary cycle corridors in the city. I used the busy North Meadow Walk (NMW) as my baseline; it has a good surface, with a few bumps and rough patches.
On NMW I recorded a low median figure— that is, the middle number in all the observations my phone made as I cycled along. I think this is the best way to measure the general condition of the surface as it is not as affected by the very large bumps that come with potholes and other aberrations.
The paths of the north Edinburgh path network, or NEPN, tend to be the smoothest in the city. The new city-centre-west-to-east-link (CCWEL) is also of good quality on this measure.
“Bumps” are how I describe the fluctuations in the surface that can make life miserable for cyclists. To capture the size and frequency of such bumps, I calculated the 95th percentile of recorded acceleration for each of my journeys in Edinburgh. That is, the value at which a particular bump will find itself in the top 5% of all bumps for that particular path.
The same sequence of paths appears, though this time CCWEL doesn’t perform quite as well.
These are the sort of thing that can throw you from the saddle, or knock your panniers off. The 0.999 quantile.
The most severe bumps are found on Leamington Walk, with the Innocent Railway Path also suffering from a particularly awful surface on this measure. CCWEL scores very well, while on-road cycle paths typically do worse.
I gave equal weighting to each of the three measures described above and found that the worst surface you can find in Edinburgh is on Leith Walk’s northbound cycle lane. No surprise.
This was followed by those on McDonald Road and the direct route between Kings Buildings and central campus of Edinburgh University. The worst paths tend to be those that encounter heavy vehicle traffic, or were constructed some time ago.
That makes the brand new cycle-only paths on Leith Walk, Picardy Place and outside Toppings particularly woeful.
I also cycled down the carriageway of Leith Walk and found that for all three of my measures, it’s significantly better than the adjacent cycle lanes.
The most severe bumps have been plotted on this interactive map.
I used a google pixel phone, quadlock phone mount and the Physics Toolbox app to measure acceleration as I cycled along, measuring linear acceleration and recording my position via GPS.
I used the square of acceleration in this analysis on the assumption that discomfort does not correlate 1:1 with acceleration.
My phone made roughly 50 observations per second; after data cleaning, I had nearly half a million observations to play with.
Caveat — my phone isn’t the best measurement tool in the world, and the statistics I have contrived aren’t perfect either. However, I assert that they will be consistent with the experience of most cyclists in Edinburgh.

I’ve been enjoying Simon Young and Chris Woodyard’s podcast Boggart and Banshee, which deals with all manner of fairy encounters, witchcraft, and supernatural accounts.
Their most recent episode covers the mysterious dolls found near Arthur’s Seat in Edinburgh in June 1836. Local boys found a crevice on the hill containing seventeen dolls, a series of male wooden figures about 3–4 inches, clothed in various fabrics and interred in tiny pine coffins. Based upon the amount of decomposition, the dolls had been placed relatively recently. Eight of these dolls have survived until today at the National Museum of Scotland, which has put together an informative page on these finds with all manner of videos and photos of the dolls.
Simon and Chris advance the view that these dolls are used in the practice of malefic magic. Based upon the different fabrics used, they believe that these dolls represent particular victims selected by a local cunning person, wrapped in pieces of stolen clothing and placed in coffins to cause death.
I’m somewhat up in the air on this. Certainly, there is a great deal of local variation and interpretations of many different magical techniques, so depositing images in this manner is not necessarily out of the realm of practice. Yet this does leave several questions open.
One of the most common magical experiments recorded in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was the creation of two wax images to recover goods lost through theft. Calling upon angels to assist, the magician was told to put the wax close enough to the fire to be heated… but not too close, lest it cause injury. This technique was still known in Britain in the 1850s, as it appears in the magical notebook of the Liverpool cunning man William Dawson Bellhouse. So our hypothetical Edinburgh cunning person is likely to have known for a much less involved method to cause death through image magic.
This is by no means definitive, of course — a magician might not have heard of this technique, or lacked access to wax for some reason, or wanted to cause a long lingering death (see below), or any number of other possibilities.
Another question is the method of deposition. The most likely place to deposit malefic magic directed against a person is on their property — either in secret, so as to work its sorcery through proximity as long as possible, or openly, as a warning to the person. There are other models, of course. Yet I have trouble understand why a cunning person would use a cavern atop a high hill near a major urban center, returning to the site seventeen times. Why not bury each coffin individually elsewhere, in the manner suggested here? Why risk discovery of the assemblage by repeated visits?
What would be an alternative explanation, then? I think previous examiners have missed the most obvious clue — and those of you who have been following my roleplaying accounts know what it is.
We have a set of entirely male figures — according to some, made to appear as soldiers — hidden in a cave on a major geographic feature named after King Arthur. Could it be that these dolls are a tribute in honor of the Once and Future King, who is often credited with resting with his knights in caverns across Britain until he comes forth again to save the land?
Admittedly, I’d feel better about this theory if there was a doll discovered that had a crown. But some of the dolls were destroyed, and given that they were in various degrees of decomposition, it’s likely any hypothetical “Arthur” doll would have been the first added and in the worst shape of all.
I’d be interested to hear what you think. Is this plausible? Am I missing something?

Today I’m going to take you on a walking tour through old Edinburgh. This piece was originally written as a script for an armchair audio tour. It incorporates stories about historical figures like Mary, Queen of Scots, the body snatchers Burke and Hare, William Wallace and Robert the Bruce as well as tales of ghosts and witches, and a sprinkling of architecture. It is intended to be read out loud and listened to on a rainy afternoon by a roaring fire with a glass of single malt whisky to hand. Slàinte mhath!
Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland, is my hometown. It regularly makes the top ten lists of best places to live in the world and best cities to visit. In summer, because Edinburgh is so far north, you can enjoy about 18 hours of daylight. The Old Town is a World Heritage Site and stretches along a ridge from Castle Rock down to the Palace of Holyroodhouse.
Edinburgh is built on seven hills which provide a dramatic backdrop to the city’s skyline. These hills include Arthur’s Seat, an ancient volcano that provides panoramic views of the city and beyond, and Calton Hill, home to some of Edinburgh’s most iconic monuments.
Now, close your eyes, and take a deep breath. The weather today is cool, with a breeze that carries the fresh salty air from the nearby North Sea. Feel the damp, misty air on your face. Exhale and relax.

There is this idea that if you know an area, a city, you can look up its main street and see years of history having already been made. The geography of it literally recalls history just in looking. There’s where this happened, here’s where that happened. . .
Take a look down Edinburgh Scotland’s Royal Mile, and you surely see down a millenium. Starting at the west end, there’s Edinburgh Castle, site of more than a few siege takings. In it was born a king, and in it one died, as well. The king born was King James of Scotland, son of Mary Queen of Scots. He was later asked to be the king of England as well. His mom had his dad killed, it is rumored, in the castle. At best, the whole thing was a shady ordeal. Mary, Queen of Scots was not born in it, but she ruled from it for a number of years.
Maybe you think of a queen as someone in her 40’s or 50’s, but no, Mary was a maiden of some 20 something years when she returned to Scotland from France to rule the people of Scotland. But she is another story.
Come out from the castle to the promenade where the Tattoo is held. This tattoo is a military celebration of sorts, held every year during the Edinburgh International Festival in August. At this tattoo several different military regiments from all over Scotland come to show off their skills, uniforms and Scottish pride for all the world to see, and it is quite a show. It is best to take in the later of the two evening events, as the fireworks are more spectacular later on. In August, it is broad daylight at 9:30 pm! So, the good watching is around 11:30.
The Royal Mile is not the official name of the street, it is more an honorary title given to it. This is actually more than a mile, from Edinburgh Castle to Holyrood Palace, at the east end. The Royal Mile actually has 4 street names given to it. The street numbering system has them running out of numbers in short order, so they just change the street name every few blocks, and that takes care of it. Two of those names were done away with, and one assigned to that portion.
Coming from the promenade is Johnston Terrace, which extends east to Bank Street. At this corner is a speakeasy known as Deacon Brodie’s Tavern. Deacon Brodie was a highly respected cabinetmaker; well at least during the day. At night, it was a different story. He was known to be a robber in the night hours. One time he was caught in the coffers of the national treasury. He escaped then and fled the country. He then wrote a note to someone he knew in Edinburgh, from what he thought was a secure location. Authorities were able to determine this so-called secure location, went after him, placed him under arrest, brought him back to Scotland, and hung him on gallows he had himself built for someone else. It was his double life that inspired the Robert Louis Stevenson epic novel, “Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde”.
At Bank Street, the mile becomes High Street, a name which stays with it for most of its length. Walk half a block east on High Street, cross the street, and you see one landmark, the Heart of the Lothian, built into the brickwork just a few feet out the door of St. Giles Cathedral. Scotland is divided into several regions, and Edinburgh is in the center of the Lothian Region. So, the Heart of the Lothian is dead center of this region. In much earlier days, there was a prison on this site.
As I said, this Heart of the Lothian is but a few feet away from the head worship center of the Church of Scotland, St. Giles Cathedral. The Presbyterian Church worldwide has its origins here. What we call the Presbyterian Church, in Europe, is called the Church of Scotland. Its most famous preacher and head was John Knox, a Scot himself, born in Gifford. Knox was himself a disciple of John Calvin of Germany, but when he took his own stand in Scotland it was at St. Giles, and he re-established the church there. Knox was in the pulpit while Mary was on the throne just up the street, and he was heard to speak of the need for dethroning for her deeds. To re-establish St. Giles as such took evicting some adherents of the Church of England. They left and started Old St. Paul’s Episcopal Church.
The Royal Mile runs downhill, west to east, and there are some cross streets, but to facilitate passage down the hill to the north, and indirect access to patrons on the Mile, stepped passageways called closes where built here and there between buildings. It is in these closes that other establishments were located. There are many closes up and down the Mile, and each has its own history.
Step out the east door of St. Giles, take but a few steps, and you arrive at a round structure with a gabled roof known as the Mercat Cross. This was an ancient assembly point for people of the town. They assembled there to hear governmental decrees, proclamations, and to witness public hangings.
One website describes it thus: “the old center of town- marketplace, news-stand, pulpit and gallows . . . it was a real one stop shop!”
The present Mercat Cross does not stand where the original did, but that location is marked by a cross laid into the sidewalk. It was the center of the old Edinburgh.
Going a block or so east on the mile, one arrives at Tron Kirk. Kirk is Scottish for church. (Talk about the US and the UK- two countries separated by a common language!) Now before Knox arrived at St. Giles, the Church of England had pretty well dispatched the Church of Scotland out of the place. They went a block east and built the Tron Kirk.
Actually, it was called “The Bishop’s War, where the king tried to introduce Episcopal structure into the Church of Scotland. He actually took over St. Giles and made it the seat of the Bishop of the Church of England.
So, the Church of Scotland people, refusing this intrusion, went and built the Tron Kirk. The building itself is no longer a church, but its physical structure remains as a visitor center.
Cross the street again, and head east from North Street, walking until you get to a large building called Carrubbers Christian Center. Carrubbers was founded back in the 19th Century in the Carrubbers Close, as a mission. Dwight L. Moody came and brought his chief musician Ira Sankey, and together they raised enough money to build this large 4 story evangelistic center. Originally built with a two-story worship center, the lower floor was converted to other uses in recent years. The center has been a beacon of hope to Edinburgh since its inception and remains so today. It has a library, a meeting hall, and dorm rooms on the top floor for university students as well as visiting clergy.
Go further east, on that side of the street, and the building that juts out and establishes a new position for the fronting buildings is the home of the preacher from the cathedral up the street, John Knox. Knox lived here during his years when he pastored at St. Giles Cathedral. His years pastoring St. Giles were also his last. He died in this house. I will warn you, though, that the people who marked his life with this museum were not terribly kind to his message of the Gospel or his dealings.
Going further down the street one more block, the Royal Mile changes its name to Canongate, a city gate from early days of the town. On Canon Gate, one walks the rest of the mile to Holyrood Palace, the annual accommodations for the Queen of England in June. The royal family also spends a month in the north of Scotland, at Balmoral Castle.
To look up the Royal Mile is to look up into history, and it always reminds you. A sea mist, called a haar, can roll in though, and you won’t see past a block, they are so thick. But you’ll never forget where you’ve been!

Last time I lived in Edinburgh it was 1993. I moved there with a bunch of friends after university. As you might expect from a group of people who’d spent more time in the pub than in the lecture theatre, none of us had managed to get a proper graduate job.
It was the middle of a recession so we figured we’d go hang out in Edinburgh, continue the party lifestyle, do some temp work and maybe even find a job to make our parents proud.
At that time no one had heard of She Who Must Not Be Named, although funnily enough 1993 was the year that she moved to Edinburgh. She’d already sketched the outline for the Harry Potter books but in 1993 J.K. Rowling began writing in cafes such as Nicolson’s (now Spoon) and no doubt was influenced by the city’s history and architecture.
Our Edinburgh at that time revolved around nights out at indie and alternative clubs like the Mission in Victoria Street, Evol or FBI in the Cowgate, various pubs in the Grassmarket and around the University, live music at the Preservation Hall or the Ensign Ewart and visits to the many art galleries and museums (all of which were free).
We’d walk all over the city and I truly loved it. But all good things come to an end, and…

Nobody cares about the fact I’m going to Edinburgh Fringe and neither should they. I’m a comedian going on a jolly for a couple of weeks in a great city with loads of my pals and trying to make people laugh. Yes it’ll probably bankrupt me and I’ve done everything in my power to not lose money hand over fist but even so, nobody is forcing me, it’s fucking great at it’s core (once we overthrow the Tories up there charging thousands for August rents). I could use this piece to get extremely angry about class and how it’s easy to do it if you’re secretly loaded, but we all know that, so allow me to drivel on for 800 words (681 from here on in, OK and that used up five, we’re nearly there) and hopefully encourage you to tweet the link to this piece with one of the following quotes above the link so people think I’ve made some sort of life-changing point;
My show is about…..WOMEN. Does that make you uncomfortable?! Probably not. You might even know one. It came from working in women’s media and being told every day what to be angry at, what to be turned on by, what to be repulsed by, who to be angry at and why you must always, every single day, be told how to ask for a pay rise. There’s an entire industry dedicated to books about work. Can you believe it? Titles like ‘How To Get What You Want At Work And Shag Your Colleague Respectfully’ and ‘How To Boss Bitch Your Way Into Millions Of Pounds And Shit On Everyone You Know.’ People buy them! Where is the book that says ‘Here’s How To Never Fill In A TimeSheet Ever Again’ — I would buy that. Read books about shagging and love and mad stuff! Not the thing you do all day! I digress.
My show is about how sometimes I’m not angry at the right things and I do stupid shit and that true equality is ripping the piss out of men and women. The day Mother’s Day cards contain a joke is the day Gloria Steinem can have a quick fag break to relax before cracking on with the serious stuff.
And of course, there are properly awful things going on for women at the moment, but you all know about that too. I’m just inviting you to come and laugh at me for 45 minutes in the back of a pub and maybe sling me a tenner at the end for my efforts. (If you don’t, you’re sexist) A lot of Edinburgh shows are about something moving, poignant, tragic or dark, I’m here to tell you that my parents are both alive, sadly were very supportive of me, and never ask me if I’m going to get married. They fed me almost exclusively Findus Crispy Pancakes and Spaghetti Hoops for about 12 years as well so in many ways, they’re legends. I’ve got nice pals, big dark roots that I can’t afford to dye, and my life has mostly been pretty good, despite my job on the ASDA checkout and Morrisons chicken counter, so you can see my issue. In many ways, making a show out of almost exclusively stupid sexual decisions is actually harder. No pun intended. Well it is now, I wrote it and then realised.
Please come and see Woman In Progress at Southsider, 6th — 17th August, at 5.45pm. You won’t regret it, straight away at least. It’s with PBH Free Fringe, so just pay what you want at the end!
Follow me on Instagram if you liked this [at]alexandrahaddow
Thanks and hopefully see you there!

As a frequent visitor to Edinburgh, I’ve had the opportunity to explore some of the city’s best-kept secrets. While it’s easy to get caught up in the popular tourist attractions, there’s so much more to this beautiful city that often goes unnoticed. Here’s my personal guide to some of Edinburgh’s best hidden gems.
St. Bernard’s Well — Tucked away in the Dean Village, this hidden gem is a peaceful haven away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The well was built in the late 18th century and has a unique design that is said to be based on the Temple of Vesta in Italy. The tranquil setting and stunning architecture make it the perfect spot for a quiet moment of reflection.
The Writers’ Museum — While many visitors flock to the Edinburgh Castle or the National Museum of Scotland, the Writers’ Museum is often overlooked. This hidden gem celebrates the lives and works of three of Scotland’s most famous writers: Robert Burns, Sir Walter Scott, and Robert Louis Stevenson. The museum is located in a 17th-century building just off the Royal Mile and is filled with fascinating artifacts and exhibits.
The Royal Botanic Garden — While not exactly a hidden gem, the Royal Botanic Garden is often overshadowed by other popular attractions in Edinburgh. The garden boasts a vast collection of plant species from around the world, as well as stunning views of the city. It’s the perfect place for a leisurely afternoon stroll or a peaceful picnic.
Stockbridge — This charming neighborhood is just a short walk from the city center, yet it feels like a world away. With its eclectic mix of independent shops, cafes, and restaurants, Stockbridge is a great place to explore and soak up the local culture. Don’t miss the weekly farmers’ market, which is brimming with fresh, locally sourced produce.
The Sheep Heid Inn — Tucked away in the charming village of Duddingston, this historic pub is said to be the oldest in Scotland. The pub’s unique attraction is its skittle alley, a game similar to bowling that’s fun for all ages. It’s a great spot for a pint and a game of skittles with friends.
And now for a joke related to this post — Why did the writer bring a map to the Royal Botanic Garden? To find the roots of all the hidden gems! Okay, maybe it’s not the best joke, but I hope it made you smile.
As a frequent visitor to Edinburgh, I can say that these hidden gems are some of my favorite places in the city. Whether you’re a first-time visitor or a seasoned traveler, I hope this guide inspires you to explore all that Edinburgh has to offer.

I stepped foot in Edinburgh many decades ago and immediately fell in love with the place. That first sight of the city will never leave me, and I still adore the way it holds its head high. It was the strongest against Brexit, it has more graduates as a percentage than virtually any other place on the planet, and it hosts world-class innovation and research. While its infrastructure is never at a scale that the mighty London can achieve in terms of innovation, it is livable, walkable, and a fairly safe place to live.
And, so, I just loved this quote [here]:
The mix of old and new, tradition and innovation, sums up my city. Around its ancient building exists world-leading research and innovation, and, like Glasgow, it is focused on technology and scientific advancements. The city nurtured three of our cybersecurity spin-outs, and I believe we could not have succeeded as well as they did without the help of the city — in supporting investment, collaborations, and most of all, attracting the talent needed to build high-impact companies. While Brexit was a major spanner in the works, the city has managed to showcase its economic resilience — more to do with its people and businesses than by politicians — and continues to build its place on an international stage.
For students, it’s a great place to come and study and is in the Top 10 cities of the world for this. In the QS World guide, the rankings for the best city to study are [here]:
For a relatively small city, a Top 10 finish is amazing. But, it’s not a big city, and that’s a good thing! Many people can live and work within an area that allows you to walk to work, or, at least, get a bus. In fact, Edinburgh buses are great. While we have a new tram, most Edinburgh people still use the bus to get around. You are typically just 30 minutes away from anywhere in Edinburgh.
And, so, if you like hills — Edinburgh has seven of these, and an extinct volcano to walk around. For beaches, you choose whatever style you like, and for parks, you’ll find one at every turn. But, the best thing, is that it is a truly enterprising and innovative city, that prides itself on its love of education and scientific advancement.
Cities are key to our future. They are economic drivers and places to innovation. Care for your city, and let it live.

This week in Edinburgh, GDS hosted its first in-person Design System Day conference. Here are a few of my highlights from the day.
Dynamic Earth felt like a strangely appropriate place to host Design System Day 2023: the giant globe hanging above our heads was a fitting metaphor for the planetary consequences of national scale design decisions.
Samantha Ernstzen and Jennifer l’Anson reflected on the process of creating the Scottish Government Digital Design System.
Their purpose was refreshingly succinct:
“to enable teams within the Scottish public sector to design and build digital products that are accessible, usable and consistent for people accessing public services in Scotland.”
Adoption is always a challenge. Even with a strong design system, people can still put together bad forms with good components! We’ve all seen examples of digitised forms recreating the paper original, mirroring the many-boxes-per-page approach of the pre-digital era.
The challenge isn’t just educating government departments in how best to use a design system, it’s also getting external suppliers to embrace it.
Mandating use of an existing design system isn’t enough: we need to support agencies and consultancies in adopting it and implementing it successfully!
Ciandelle, Calvin and Steve gave a quickfire summary of all the updates GOV.UK have been making, including improving accessibility.
One newly released development is the Exit this page feature. It allows a user to quickly close down a page if they are in danger: particularly useful for those suffering domestic abuse. It may look like just a small button, but took about five years of work to research and implement!
Massive news: designers were delighted to hear that a new crown’s gonna drop — watch this space for a slightly modified GOV.UK logo coming soon!
Katrina Birch facilitated a fantastic panel on trauma-informed research and design.
70% of people have experienced trauma, and 1 in 10 will suffer from PTSD at some point in their life. We should be aware of trauma and the risk of vicarious trauma when conducting user research around difficult topics. Shout out to Chayn, getting an honourable mention for their excellent resources on the topic.
Tash Willcocks closed out the day with her thoughts on the elephant in the room: teams.
Design systems are enablers of scale and consistency, but developing and establishing them requires conditions of high trust and psychological safety.
In short, to save the parrots, we must use the shallot and master the elephant (I promise it made sense, you had to be there).
Thanks so much to all the volunteers and GDS-ers that made Design System Day 2023 possible: it was a glorious gathering of passionate practitioners!
A final quote from the day, sums up nicely the role of design in most organisations:
“We’re not here just to build components and patterns. We make impact through multiplier effects.”
Looking forward to next year!

HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT
I recall standing outside the Pleasance Dome flyering my show a few years ago.
I was exhausted and knew I had to fill a big room and faced losing cash so I was anxious and desperate to make sure people came to see me.
I had rented a good flat and paid for amazing posters and had what I believed to be a fabulous show.
Then I spotted a couple of people who had seen me at a showcase show and had taken my flyer after the gig as they liked my stuff. I brightened up and as I approached them I watched a comedy promoter hand them two free tickets to his latest newly signed act’s show.
They took them. They were FREE.
He had a HUGE wad of free tickets and was giving them to people all around the Pleasance Dome. I lost the sale. I watched and my heart sank as people didn’t give a fuck how funny I had been at the 1pm showcase show.
They had free tickets and free is everything in this current climate.
No doubt the fringe this year yet again will release the BEST EVER SALES AT THE FRINGE and sit back as they manipulate the figures and the PR will spin it good.
I know that the figures aren’t always true, for ONE BIG SELL OUT there are hundreds of smaller shows underwriting them in the big venues and those comics were doing it on their own cash in the hope of a crowd.
Performers go home skint, owing money and are artistically broken.
I have no issue with the big paid venues, I just see issues that the Free Festival can resolve.
On the last weekend of the last few fringe’s I watched BIG NAMED ACTS give away TWO for ONES on the last Thursday and Friday. That’s not a great financial sign and was I aggressively flyered for a comic whose face graces the BILLBOARDS to buy tickets for his ‘EXTRA SOLD OUT SHOW’ which is a weird oxymoron. It can’t be sold out and still have tickets to sell.
Also audience members must be horrified to find out they had paid full price for tickets and realised half the audience were in for free or HALF PRICE and that’s an insult to early bird ticket buyers.
People were so scared of losing face.
This year am back at The Counting House Ballroom as is my daughter comedian Ashley Storrie.
Last year both me and Ashley had a BUMPER run and played to full rooms every day. I had people sitting on the floor of my venue and Ashley had people standing in her room and outside for a chance to get in.
They put cash in the buckets. We left with a profit, a very good profit if truth be told. We also told the crowds if they donated silver and bronze coins we gave that to the homeless and later on we dished it out fairly round the city’s street collectors.
I encouraged other comics and acts to get up and pitch their shows to my big comedy loving full capacity crowd. I tweeted about other comics gigs and helped flyer for other shows. It felt like THE FRINGE.
The people who came to the shows were brilliant.
Dealing with hard cash was weird. I felt like a mid price day time sex worker, I haven’t had that much money in my bag in years. We generally don’t carry much cash as a society now. It reminded me of when I owned a pub and used to count the takings.
People no longer see the Free Festival shows as ‘well it’s free it must be shit’ and I don’t believe they ever did. This is a nice neat rumour and label put on it by the same people who resent the free shows but have no issue giving out free tickets at a paid venue for a show that can’t shift a ticket.
When I did all the big “paid” venues I made thousands of pounds but the financial cut left to me was woeful and I STILL made a profit am one of the few who did. My accountant was stunned by the business model that means you pay for seats in advance and a venue is guaranteed their cash and cut NO MATTER WHAT before you step foot in the capital. The artist takes all the risk. Every seat you dont sell the venue has already been paid for that, the loss is not theirs….it’s YOURS.
Think of it this way…
Imagine you hired a bus with twenty seats, you paid the company for twenty seats….if you only sold 6 of those seats, you lose money.
Now think of that in a 200 seater venue at the fringe where the market is SATURATED with comics giving away FREE SEATS AND TWO FOR ONE SEATS every single day. Now you see my point.
Tax was a well worn phrase when talking about the free venues.
“Yes, but do the free festival comics declare their takings?” one comedy promoter asked me.
I don’t think anybody has the right to assume anyone is fucking their taxes based on a dislike of their business model. If you have an issue with people not paying their due tax please go check some Tory peers before you nitpick at comics you avaricious cunts. While you are at it please make sure the big venues who boast “BEST YEAR EVER” are not putting their profits into an offshore account to avoid taxes in UK.
I pay my tax.
I love the fringe and the past few years doing free fringe shows means I have loved it more. It felt like the old days. It felt good and it felt fair.
I encouraged the people who were skint and living under austerity to come see our shows for free. I also encouraged people who saw the show to take money OUT OF THE BUCKET if they needed some cash.
some tips for acts putting on a FREE SHOW….
Me and My daughter Ashley Storrie are back at the Counting House this year.

Today marked the conclusion of our journey. We had been traveling for nine days and were eager to get home. It had been a while since we had unwinded and slept in our bed at home.
Another reason was my spouse wasn’t feeling well. Our outing in Stonehaven yesterday gave him the chills. We were lucky he did not become ill while traveling, as it would have derailed our entire itinerary.
However, on our final day in Edinburgh, we had one more day of exploring before ending our trip.
After leaving our cabin, we headed towards Dundee on the Tay estuary. Around 11 am, we reached the magnificent city of Dundee. Everything appeared wonderful, and the weather was ideal.
Fun Fact: In 2014, Dundee was recognized by the United Nations as the UK’s first-ever UNESCO City of Design.
We went to a cafe and had a tuna sandwich with coffee. We strolled beside the Tay River. The River Tay is the longest river in Scotland and the seventh-longest in Great Britain.

In the heart of Scotland lies a city steeped in history, culture, and academia: Edinburgh. Home to one of the world’s most prestigious universities, the University of Edinburgh, the city attracts students from all corners of the globe. Among the many challenges that come with starting a new chapter in a different city, finding the perfect accommodation stands as a pivotal moment in a student’s life.
Picture this: a vibrant young student, full of ambition and excitement, stepping foot into the historic cobblestone streets of Edinburgh. For many, this marks the beginning of an incredible journey towards higher education and personal growth. But behind this exciting new chapter lies a quest for the perfect place to call home during these formative years.
For Jamie, a student hailing from London, the search for student accommodation Edinburgh was both thrilling and daunting. Having been accepted into the University of Edinburgh’s prestigious business program, Jamie found himself faced with the task of finding accommodation that suited not only his budget but also his need for a conducive environment for studying.
The quest began online, scrolling through countless listings and options. From shared flats to purpose-built student accommodations, the choices seemed endless. Each listing had its unique charm, promising proximity to the university, modern facilities, and a vibrant community of fellow students.
After much deliberation, Jamie narrowed down his options to a few promising prospects. He decided to visit Edinburgh in person, a decision that would prove invaluable in his search. Stepping into the city, he was greeted by its rich history and the blend of old-world charm with a bustling modernity — a juxtaposition that captured his heart instantly.
His first visit was to a student housing complex located conveniently close to the university. As he walked through the doors, he was met with a lively atmosphere — students chatting in the common areas, engaging in study groups, and overall, a sense of community that was palpable. The rooms were modern, compact yet cozy, equipped with all the essentials a student could need. The allure of being surrounded by like-minded peers was tempting.
However, Jamie wanted to explore other options before making a decision. He ventured into the heart of the city, where charming old buildings were converted into student flats. The historic ambiance was undeniable, but the rooms were often smaller and lacked some of the modern amenities he had seen in the purpose-built accommodations.
Then came the visit to a shared flat — a common choice among students looking for a more independent living experience. The prospect of living with a few roommates excited Jamie. The flat was spacious, with each room uniquely decorated, reflecting the personalities of its occupants. The idea of creating a home away from home with fellow students felt appealing, fostering a sense of camaraderie.
After careful consideration and weighing the pros and cons of each option, Jamie ultimately chose to reside in the purpose-built student accommodation. Its proximity to the university, modern amenities, and the vibrant community it offered aligned perfectly with his aspirations for his university life.
Settling into his new accommodation, Jamie found himself surrounded by a diverse group of students — each with their own stories, cultures, and ambitions. The communal spaces became a hub for socializing, studying, and forging lifelong friendships.
Living in student accommodation in Edinburgh wasn’t just about having a place to stay; it was an integral part of Jamie’s university experience. It became the backdrop for late-night study sessions, impromptu gatherings, and the formation of lasting bonds.
As Jamie delved deeper into his studies, he realized that the choice of accommodation had a profound impact on his overall university journey. The convenience, the sense of community, and the support from fellow students made navigating the challenges of university life more manageable.
Looking back, Jamie reminisces about the thrill of finding the perfect place to live in Edinburgh. It wasn’t just a roof over his head; it was the cornerstone of his university adventure — a place where he didn’t just reside but truly belonged.
For any student venturing into the vibrant city of Edinburgh, the quest for accommodation may seem like a daunting task, but it’s a journey filled with choices that shape an unforgettable university experience — a journey much like Jamie’s, filled with exploration, decisions, and ultimately, a place to call home.

Glasgow, Edinburgh’s younger and cheekier brother. A winter’s visit to this exciting city filled me with a lot of excitement. The journey began with a night bus from London Victoria to Buchanan Street Station, north of the English/ Scottish border. As soon as I arrived on the bus, I was surrounded by the echoes of the thick Glaswegian accent. Coupled with that were men chewing away on Sainsbury’s 5 packs of donuts and mothers and daughters arguing about who had the window seat. Presumably the views from the Megabus up the M40 and M6 overnight weren’t to be missed. On arrival at 7am into Glasgow, it was still dark. I was due to visit one of my oldest friends, Greg Bond, however I would first be met by his namesake, Greggs, who provided me with a coffee and Pan au Chocolat to welcome me to Scotland. The sun only lights up the city 30 minutes after it would in London, which is also known for its excellent weather. I wandered through the chartered streets of the city where I was surprised by an incredible orange and yellow sunset that crept over the Lanarkshire hills and the schemes that fill Glasgow’s skyline.
Arching past the Glasgow Necropolis (the cemetery) and the Tennents beer factory, I wandered to the East End of the city to meet Greg and his girlfriend, Jess. We soon headed to Tibo Bistro, a local Scottish brunch eatery where I tried my first full Scottish breakfast. This included, black pudding and haggis, both of which I hadn’t tried for a very long time but were incredibly tasty. Glasgow has an excellent selection of restaurants, notably to add, the Ubiquitous Chip, which I previously visited in 2016 on my first visit to this city (I would highly recommend both of these places). The rest of the day would be spent hopping around bars and watching football, the hoops (Celtic) no less were playing at home and some of the bars refused to show the premier league but rather would show the Scottish games. It’s understandable, really. You got a real sense of how strong the local identity is in Glasgow. Not only from the accent and their pride towards either Rangers or Celtic Football Clubs but also from their use of language. Words you would never use in the South of England, or internationally in this language. ‘Spu*k’, ‘C*nt’ and ‘Sh*te’ are all very much on the table and part of the local tongue. Jess mentioned this is just part of the Glasgwegian identity and people of all ages, with the exception of really formal events or in the company of elderly family, would people liberallly use these words. For example, Jess said ‘I don’t want to sp*nk all my money away travelling’. The sense of irony was real for me here.
We stopped for a bite to eat at a chicken burger joint, complemented naturally by a pint of Tennents, of course. Here, we met Greg’s friends Gus, with whom he shared his birthday event with that evening and Zac, who I’d met many moons ago while he and Greg were at university here. We then headed to a bar called the rum shack, where we met more of their friends, most of whom were from Greg and Gus’ former and current hockey clubs. Being in Glasgow and with a lot of sporty, sociable folks, this made for quite a drink heavy evening. We played a game called ‘ou l’est le poulet’, which literally translates from French as ‘where is the chicken?’. Here, Gus and Greg identified themselves as the ‘chickens’ and they organised a kitty of money for drinks for them and whoever could find them throughout the night. They selected 15–20 bars within a few miles radius of the rum shack and they said the first to meet us at the one they were at will be able to benefit from the complimentary drinks from the budget. The first there would receive a Champagne reception. Luckily, I was with two local Glaswegian blokes who knew Greg, Gus and the city very well so we made it to this grand reception after stopping at only 2 other pubs on the way to the Ivory hotel. The Ivory was an eyesore geographically away from the collection of other proposed pubs. We thought we’d go and check it just to be sure, but we didn’t genuinely believe that they’d actually be there. As the rest of the groups arrived, we then settled into the drinks from the kitty as well as some tasty nachos. The night continued from the Ivory hotel to another bar in town. After 12 hours on the beers on the back of a night bus, I decided to call it an evening before my flight home in the morning back to London town. All in all, I’d highly recommend this city for food, drinking and a good time watching sport. But keep an eye and an ear open for the Glaswegian tongue.

When Henry was a wee one I read to him every night. He’d pick two or three picture books from his bookshelf, and we’d cuddle in the couch or his bed, and read together. As a train fanatic he had quite a few train books, and Slow Train from Oxmox was one of his favorites.
The little book was about just that, a slow train goes through the country and encounters animals and assorted obstacles. It’s whimsical and cheerful, perfect for a night time story.
When I spent a little over two weeks in London in April, one of my goals was to venture outside the city and explore other parts of UK. I picked Edinburgh for the second weekend. For years Edinburgh Yarn Festival was one of the go-to fiber events in Europe, and I’m still kicking myself for not making it in 2019, because no one knew that was going to be the last one. Regardless, Edinburgh the city still held my intense interest and I decided that was my destination for the weekend.
The train from Kings Cross Station in London to Edinburgh is a little over five hours on LNER line (LNER stands for London North Eastern Railway and is pronounced with the letters spelled out, not “liner” as I first thought), and the route goes along the east side of England, at some point right by the beach. The views are stunning. — Side note, after the trip I rewatched Harry Potter movies. I can’t tell you how thrilling it was to see the LNER trains in the background every time they were in Kings Cross Station.
I took off from London on Friday morning, spent Friday evening to Sunday morning in Edinburgh. I booked the return trip to leave around 1:30pm, so I’d have lunch in Edinburgh and be back in London for dinner. The train ride is very comfortable with free wifi and electric outlets, so I could listen to my audiobook while knitting, or napping. I had a window seat facing forward as I picked, and most of the time the seat next to me was empty.
About an hour outside of London, suddenly there was loud metal screeching and the train lurched forward, eventually came to a stop, but not before there was a big thump, hitting something big. Soon the conductor’s voice came through the scratchy speaker, yes, there was a deer on the track and the train hit it; yes, the engineers would have to check out the damage, and no, no one could get off the train. Of course they would keep the passengers updated. But what about Bambi??
So we wait. Every ten minutes or so the conductor came on the speaker, still checking the damage, getting help from the next station, possibly moving everyone to another train. Just how big was Bambi? Maybe Bambi was a big boy with big horns, big enough to cause the train to lose air pressure. The next, closest, station was fifteen minutes away, and from the conductor’s voice, the engineers wondered aloud if the train would be able to go that far with the damage, or have another train fetch all the passengers. Neither option seem comforting when you are in the middle of the beautiful but remote English countryside. I looked on Google Map and the only thing nearby was a tiny nursery school. I wondered where the kids came from.
More than an hour after the thump, a train materialized itself on the track next to our train, going the same direction(!), and very slowly came to a stop(!!). Passengers started moving around, gathering their bags— are we being rescued? How do we all fit in that already packed train? Before we knew it, just like how it came, the train slowly started moving again, and minutes later, gone.
Now what? I’m sure I wasn’t the only one started calculating how much water and food might be in our luggage and in the dining car.
Apparently the other train dropped off some engineers, because soon there were a bunch of people in bright neon green and orange garb walking along the tracks, toward the head of our train.
More waiting. Thirty minutes later the train moved! And continued to run like nothing happened, till it unceremoniously stopped at the next station, Peterborough, where everyone was ordered to pack their things and depart, find their own ways. I guess all this was announced in the running gargles from the conductor, and I wasn’t the only one confused once we landed on the cold platform. Now it’s up to this tiny station to deal with hundreds of unexpected passengers heading to London, already delayed for hours.
You got to give it to the British for efficiency. The little station handled the glitch better than most American airports. The digital display spelled out clearly how many trains are passing and heading to Kings Cross in the next hour, which cars had seats, and what section of the platform had the best chance to get on the train. No one checked tickets. The bathroom queue went from over fifty to none. By the third train most people were out of the station and on their way to London.
I arrived at Kings Cross past 11pm, more than four hours after planned, cold and hungry. I was ready for a hot meal and warm bed.

Edinburgh during the fringe is a glorious celebration of the artistic spirit, with any tourist walking down the Royal Mile sure to be deluged with flyers from young people eager to promote their low-budget show. While having a coffee in George Square, I was approached by someone hawking a one-person re-enactment of the Titanic disaster, an improvised musical called Shamilton and a lady (with a haystack hairdo) impersonating Melania Trump.
But the image that most visitors will take away from the 2022 fringe is of overflowing rubbish bins and gutters strewn with discarded coffee cups and takeaway meal cartons. The binmen were on a two-week strike. The dispute has since spread through much of the rest of Scotland.
The refuse collectors are protesting about a 5% pay offer which they rightly point out will not match the rate of inflation. The pay “rise” is thus, in real terms, a pay cut. Small wonder that they are protesting.
But the speed with which Edinburgh descended into slovenliness is an illustration of the theme I wrote about in my last book, More; that our standard of living depends on the efforts and co-operation of millions of strangers. It is not just that we eat food that was grown on the other side of the world or rely on communication tools made in Asia. We depend on our fellow citizens to educate our children, keep us healthy, defend our borders and clean our streets.
This co-operation faces two interlinked threats. The first is that international trade in goods and services relies on a willingness to trust other countries, and to place economic interests above strategic desires. The first great era of globalisation in the late 19th century saw vast levels of migration from Europe to the “new worlds” of North and South America, and monetary co-operation that allowed the Bank of England to borrow from its counterparts in France and Russia when its gold reserves were low. But it all disintegrated with the outbreak of war in 1914; world trade (as measured by exports as a proportion of GDP) did not recover until the 1970s.
The late 19th century era has been dubbed the “pax Britannica” as Britain was the centre of the international monetary system (the gold standard) and, through its navy, ensured that global seaborne trade was safe from piracy. And the post-1945 era could be dubbed the “pax Americana” as the US supported its European (and Japanese allies) both militarily and economically. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the post-Mao change in Chinese economic policy brought most of the world into the global trading system.
Might we see another great reversal? There is little evidence of it in the data so far. But the rhetoric is headed in one direction: sanctions on Russia, tariffs on China and a determination in many countries, after the pandemic, to ensure that some strategically important goods are produced at home. The recent sabre-rattling of China over Taiwan might be an indicator of the next tipping point.
The second threat to co-operation lies in domestic politics. In part, this stems from globalisation which is perceived in many western countries as being good for the highly-educated elite but bad for ordinary workers. There has definitely been a slowdown in the growth rate of real earnings of the average worker in recent decades and in most countries, rising inequality. There is a vigorous debate among economists as to the causes of this shift with technological change playing at least as big a role as globalisation.
But this sluggish growth in real incomes has broken the contract between politicians and the people they govern, in which votes are supplied in return for increased prosperity. That has fuelled the disillusionment with politicians that was the subject of an earlier book of mine, The Last Vote. This discontent has meant constraints in democracy in some countries where its roots are shallow, such as Russia and Hungary. And in western countries it has led to the rise of “nativist” politicians like Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen, who imply that a “globalist” elite is plotting to undermine their countries.
How serious is this threat? It is easy to forget that Donald Trump lost the popular vote in both 2016 and 2020, taking office only because of the vagaries of the electoral college system. But his attempt to cling on to office in 2020 showed how tenuous are the institutional supports for democracy in the US; it was only the honesty of a few Republican officials in swing states that prevented him from stealing the election. In this category, one might add the outrageous attempt by the Conservative party to prorogue the British Parliament in 2019, a step that was blocked by the Supreme Court in an 11–0 decision.
In her book “How Civil Wars Start”, Barbara Walter details her research into the crucial factors that can cause a descent into chaos; excessive factionalism, the politics of resentment and the existence of armed groups. In particular, she refers to the existence of “anocracy” where a nominal democracy exists but the institutional structure that supports it (independent courts, a free press etc) have been undermined.
Anocracies can often descend into dictatorship, as Russia has shown. But they can head in another direction, as happened in Lebanon in the 1980s and Yugoslavia as the state’s authority disintegrates into regional and religious factions. Ms Walter is not predicting a re-enactment of the US Civil War of the 1860s, with uniformed armies fighting pitched battles, but a steady descent into chaos.
And if one looks at history, it is replete with examples of states disintegrating in the face of internal and external challenges. The western Roman empire was declining long before Rome was sacked in 410CE or Romulus Augustulus, the last emperor, was deposed in 476CE. The Hapsburg dynastic empire, steadily assembled over many centuries, disintegrated within weeks in 1918. Chaos is as likely an outcome as dictatorship.
The concept that Britain is only “four meals away from anarchy” has been used by MI5 to assess strategic risks and variations of the quote have been attributed to Lenin and the scifi writers Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. The original quote seems to have come from Alfred Henry Lewis back in 1896 who wrote” that the only barrier between us and anarchy is the last nine meals we’ve had” .
Back in the 1970s, a time when the country was rocked by high inflation, strikes and energy shortages, there was talk that Britain was “ungovernable”. There have been moments since then, notably during the riots of 2011, when the veneer of society has worn very thin.
The very connections that supply us with our food, energy and gadgets are also a source of our vulnerability, which could come in the form of embargoes, blockades or cyberattacks. Specialisation, which is at the heart of the modern economy, means that few of us have the means or the expertise to support ourselves.
Turmoil in America also affects the rest of the developed world since the post-1945 global settlement is built on the US’s economic and military strength. In 410CE, faced with Saxon incursions, the British wrote to Rome to appeal for help (according to one historical account). The emperor Honorius replied that they must look to their own defence. Isolationists in the US argue that Europe should do the same.
One can map out a future for the world in which the bonds that tie together the US and Europe disintegrate in the face of Russian and Chinese pressure, declining living standards provoke unrest at home which leads to violence on the streets, and public services break down leading to an even further decline in welfare.
This outcome is still only a possibility rather than a probability. But it is an outcome we should all consider before voting for those who would destroy the global economic structure.

I am a Student Ambassador with the University of Edinburgh. My job is to give tours of the university to visitors, prospective students and to anybody who is interested in the university. I mostly work for the department of Student Recruitment and Admissions and for Edinburgh Global, but I can be contracted by any department of the university. I am expected to help out on Open Days, School Visits, Alumni Events, teacher training sessions and on visits from International Delegations of other Universities.
On Open Days I give out leaflets, show people around the campus and just make them feel in general comfortable around the university.
In some cases I go on Schools visits either with my department of the School of Geosciences or the general student recruitment team.
Being a Student Ambassador is a real job with real pay. I even have a LinkedIn entry on it!
https://uk.linkedin.com/in/hunor-de%C3%A1k-458503121
I conduct university tours around the Central Campus/King’s Buildings, do office work, take part in student Q&A sessions, help with student support staff training, represent the university on school visits and help to organise/run university Open Days. I work for the Student Recruitment & Admissions, Edinburgh Global and Go Abroad Edinburgh.
Student Ambassadors are the face of the University of Edinburgh to prospective students, their parents/carers and teachers/advisers. The Student Ambassador team consists of 75 students, both UG and PG, from a range of Schools, Colleges, backgrounds and nationalities. The scheme is primarily designed to support the work of the Student Recruitment and Admissions Team and Edinburgh Global, however, from time to time Student Ambassadors have the opportunity to work for a range of other departments from around the University.
This is the official spiel. Looked over by university officials and decided in advance. To be honest I don’t really like this description, as it removes the honesty from my work.
In reality being a student ambassador is so much more than a job! It is a gift and an experience.
I get to work with a diverse range of people, and a diverse age range of people. I showed Primary school pupils around Appleton Tower, I introduced Scottish food to new students from around the globe and helped run an event at St Cecilia’s Hall for the old Alumni who graduated with the university 40–50 years ago. As a Student Ambassador I met such a nice number of people.
I worked under the wings of so many interesting university leaders as well.
Through the scheme I met so many fellow Student Ambassadors, that if I would have a thousand hands with hundreds of fingers I wouldn’t be able to count them! I met people from St. Petersburg, Florida, Vienna, the Netherlands, south California. I saw a wide range of departments from helping to host a music night to the alumni at St Cecilia’s Hall to handing out goodie bags to the newly graduated students of the University. I have done everything from office work for ERASMUS+ to waste management and moving boxes in the dungeons.
Being a Student Ambassador helped to improve my speaking skills, trained me to work better as a member of a group and gave me a greater range of confidence.
The University of Edinburgh is an ancient Scottish institution that educated the great Men of the Scottish Enlightenment, revolutionised the world of science and produced global leaders.
The university is a warm and welcoming place where I built up lots of skills for employment.
Step into the world that is the University of Edinburgh!

Peter Drake, a teacher from Hexham in Britain, spent many years in the classroom encouraging the learning of science. In recent years, Peter has found a new path in writing, music, and the arts. Today, he uses his experience to inspire others, proving that life after teaching can be just as rewarding and full of new adventures and doesn’t need to take place in the classroom.
Some cities make an impression the moment you arrive. Others take a little time, revealing their beauty and character slowly. Edinburgh, however, is in a category all of its own — a place that doesn’t just leave an impression but sears itself into your memory, heart, and soul. For me, Edinburgh’s allure is most powerful during that extraordinary moment each year when the Edinburgh Festival Fringe transforms the city into the beating heart of global creativity.
Every August, this historic Scottish capital erupts into life, laughter, noise, and energy. Streets that are usually relatively calm thrum with a chaotic symphony of buskers, actors, dancers, musicians, and visitors from all corners of the world. Cafés spill over with animated conversation, parks host pop-up performances, and every available space — from traditional theatres to tiny basements — is pressed into service for the arts. If ever a city could wear joy like a cloak, it is Edinburgh during the Fringe.
I feel deeply connected to Edinburgh, not least because of my own unforgettable experience of the Fringe. Some years ago, my play, The Prisoner’s Friend, was performed during the festival. Seeing a piece of writing, crafted over months of quiet work, take on a new life before an audience of strangers in such a vibrant setting was a defining moment for me. There is something intoxicating about watching people react to your words — to hear them laugh, to see them fall silent with emotion, to feel that invisible thread of understanding stretch between stage and audience. For anyone who has created, performed, or even simply spectated during the Fringe, the memory leaves an indelible mark.
During that month, the city itself becomes more than just a backdrop; it feels like an active participant in the festival. The ancient streets and winding closes seem to lean in, listening. The grand, stern buildings of the New Town provide a dramatic stage set, while the narrow, atmospheric lanes of the Old Town whisper history and secrets around every corner. There’s a profound sense that Edinburgh is uniquely suited to house such an explosion of creativity — a city proud of its culture, deeply aware of its own myths and legends, yet refreshingly willing to let loose and celebrate the new.
Of course, part of what makes the Fringe experience so powerful is the sense of freedom it offers. Nowhere else in the world can so many performers, both seasoned professionals and complete beginners, share space so democratically. Whether your production has a massive budget or is fueled solely by passion and a few hand-painted posters, the Fringe offers a platform. It is, at heart, a celebration of taking a risk, of putting yourself and your art in front of the world without guarantees or safety nets.
That spirit permeated everything during the time I spent there. Days were crammed with rehearsals, flyering on the Royal Mile, frantic last-minute set changes, and post-show discussions in packed pubs. Nights were filled with laughter, new friendships, and a thrilling sense of community. For one glorious month, you become part of a tribe — a massive, sprawling, creative tribe that welcomes anyone willing to leap into the unknown.
I often think about those August days and nights, and the way they stand in contrast to the quieter months when the festival has packed up and the city breathes a little easier. Yet even outside of August, Edinburgh remains magnificent. Climb Arthur’s Seat for a panoramic view of a city that seamlessly marries medieval and modern. Walk through the peaceful elegance of the Georgian New Town, with its perfectly symmetrical streets and squares. Explore the mysteries of the Old Town, where narrow closes and hidden courtyards make you feel as though you might step into another century.
And always, whether it’s August or April, the city’s commitment to culture shines through. From the National Museum of Scotland to the Scottish National Gallery, from the historic libraries to the storytelling centres, Edinburgh is a place where history, art, and ideas are not just preserved but celebrated.
For me personally, the emotional connection to Edinburgh will always be anchored in that heady, transformative experience of the Fringe. It’s not just about the performances or the audiences — it’s about being part of something larger than yourself. It’s about feeling, even for a brief time, that you are contributing to a shared celebration of imagination, creativity, and human connection.
Every year when August rolls around, I feel a twinge of longing. I picture the crowds gathering, the pop-up stages going up, the laughter echoing down the cobbled streets. I imagine first-time performers nervously stepping onto stages, writers seeing their characters come to life, audiences discovering unexpected delights in hidden venues.
Few who have performed at the Fringe ever forget it. The highs are high, the lows can be humbling, but the memories are golden. Whether your show draws a full house or plays to a handful, whether you win awards or simply win the respect of your peers, the experience changes you. It reminds you that art matters. That risk matters. That connection — raw, real, immediate connection — is what we all crave, and occasionally, in a special place like Edinburgh during the Fringe, we find it.
In a world that sometimes feels increasingly fragmented and divided, that spirit of celebration and connection feels more precious than ever. And so I will always hold Edinburgh close — not just as a stunning city of history and beauty, but as a place where, for a brief, shining moment, anything feels possible.

“This is a city of shifting light, of changing skies, of sudden vistas. A city so beautiful it breaks the heart again and again.”
― Alexander McCall Smith
As the sun rises, I watch the city of Edinburgh slowly revealed… a dark foggy nothingness giving way to a thousand rooftops accented by a spire here and there, dark and unfocused at first, but gradually taking on shape, form, and color. Finally, the edge of the sun peeks over the horizon and dazzling light spills into and across the room, putting a sudden and audible end to muffled conversations.
The bride and groom touch, and she whispers something softly into his ear. Both turn to look out the open window. On the table beside them, a once-full bottle of fine malt, a dozen empty glasses, and a stone jug of spring water sit where they were last touched.
“Wow… Look at that!” from the kilted man wearing the splendid red uniform tunic.
I have no words to adequately describe the scene being painted below as the sun continues its steady, lazy morning stretch, revealing a hilltop here, a wisp of smoke from a chimney there, the ancient castle perched to our left, and the blue ocean in the distance bathed…

Let’s all collectively ignore that this article is late (I need a lot of grace these days 😭)
Hi guys! It’s been a HOT minute (ironically😅). I know, I take full responsibility for my prolonged absence. The past several months have been a lot; mentally, emotionally, and physically. I can only say thank God for His grace through it all.
I have a lot to say and so much gist for you guys
The first thing I’d like to share is the different aspects of my first half-year on the other side of the globe.
Transportation
One of my favourite things about living here is the transportation system. Gone are the days of fighting passengers to enter a bus and fighting bus conductors for change. The transportation system I have experienced here (mostly buses) is more comfortable and seamless.
Most buses I’ve used are double-decker with an upper level for passengers to sit. Bus fares are paid with exact amounts, prepaid bus cards, free bus travel cards, or contactless payment methods. And yes, I said free bus travel. Scotland has free bus travel for under 22s, over 60s and disabled travellers.
There are accessibility accommodations on buses such as designated seats for elderly travellers, disabled travellers, and people with buggies.
For the most part, you don’t have to wait endlessly for the bus. Bus delays are often communicated on electronic displays at bus stops and Google Maps (which is usually more accurate). Any changes in bus stops or bus routes are well communicated to passengers in advance.
Besides the buses, there are trams and trains, modes of transportation that I wasn’t familiar with before living here. Cycling is also a thing here (I’ve even tossed around the idea of getting a bicycle a few times).
Since being here, I have learnt to embrace walking as part of my everyday life. These days a 21-minute walk is just a nice little exercise. The roads are well-designed to accommodate pedestrian traffic and motorists obey traffic rules, so I no longer have hypertension whenever I cross the road.
Compared to how clueless I was when I first arrived, I’ve largely settled into making my way downtown, walkin’ fast faces pass and I’m home-bound (tadadadadada). Ma da mi loun, I’m not a serious geh😜
Every once in a while though, I miss the thrill of rushing around and the fun of Danfo drama, I’m a Lagos girl after all.
Advice: Wear comfortable shoes, walking becomes a part of you
Weather
The stark difference in weather has been the most jarring part of moving to Edinburgh. I’ve never lived in a place with four actual seasons before and it’s an experience I can’t fully express. So far, I’ve experienced Winterrrr 🥶, gorgeous Spring, Summer (ish), and Autumn-yet to be decided.
Winter almost broke me😭
It was cold, or as the wobble-headed narrator of the Oversimplified YouTube channel says “STUPID COLD!” I made many a perilous journey to and from class, but like they say, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger 💪🏽. I held out hope every freezing day, for the relief of a warm summertime that everyone seemed to eagerly expect.
UNFORTUNATELY, it was all a SCAM! 😭
Spring was cold, Summer was cold, Autumn is COLD.
Oh, and apart from the low temperatures, there are wind speeds that go over vehicle speed limits and rains that appear out of nowhere. It is a fascinating experience.
Am I used to it? I don’t think it’s something to get used to honestly. I want to get used to nice things; like someone spending money on me, living a baby girl lifestyle, you know, nice things.
Advice: Expect any weather, and always carry an umbrella
The Environment, The People
Scotland is beautiful and Edinburgh is stunning.
As erratic as the weather can be here, the skies are a deep and beautiful shade of blue, the sun (when it decides to grace us with its presence) shoots down golden rays to illuminate the greenery, and on the rarest of occasions, I have seen the most perfectly coloured rainbows adorn a pale-bright sky.
The city is a spectacular landscape surrounded by hills and dotted with the most luscious trees and shrubs. Breathtaking (see Exhibit A below). Exploring Edinburgh’s rich scenery, heritage and uniqueness deserves a post of its own (coming soon? fingers crossed)
Now for the people.
At this point, I’m pretty sure Scottish people don’t speak English. They speak a language only they can understand. Fair warning: if you can understand English, don’t expect to automatically understand Scottish English.
Picture this: You go to eat at a fancy with a whole bar section for drinks. You look at the list of nice-sounding beverages and decide you're too broke (for now) to afford them, so you walk up to the bar and ask for a glass of water. You’re greeted with a smile and a nod. “This is going well.” you think as the bartender fills a glass with tap water (don’t worry, it’s clean). You’re about to stretch your hand when the bartender asks “Dyu like some aeyce?” Now you’re lost. “What is aeyce?” “Does it cost extra?” “How do I respond?”.
The bartender senses the activation of your flight-freeze response and points at the ice bucket next to the counter. Ice. He’s asking if you want ice 🤦🏽‍♀️
Excuse me for that long scenario, I haven’t written fiction in a while and I quite enjoyed that.
Back to the story.
Their weird rendition of English aside, I see Scottish people like regular people, with the good and the not-so-good. There’s a general “mind your business” vibe here which isn’t necessarily good or bad. However, seeing some of the effects of this way of life has made me appreciate that the cultural system of community involvement in personal and interpersonal matters can be quite valuable.
Edinburgh is full of people from all over the world, which is expected of any tourist city. Going from a racially homogenous place like Nigeria to a vastly multicultural hub like this is like exploring a whole new world. I have heard many new languages, seen many new faces and experienced many new cultures.
Side note: I finally ate Chinese, Indian and Italian food; it was all delicious, you should try them too.
Community (Nigerian shops, Nigerian students, Nigerian food)
This probably goes without saying, but there are Nigerians in Edinburgh. There are Nigerian grocery shops and hairstylists in Edinburgh. Just as in places like London and Manchester, there is a flourishing Nigerian community in Edinburgh.
When I arrived at my school, I was surprised to be surrounded by Nigerians in class and at the hostel. In some ways, it felt like I never left Nigeria. Ironically, I have learnt more about Nigeria in Edinburgh than I ever learnt in Nigeria.
Having a community of people who can relate to my perspective is refreshing. I’ve made some great friends here who are simply amazing.
Side note: I’ve also made friends from other countries; trust me, it’s not as hard as it seems.
I’m loving my time here in Edinburgh, and getting that nice abroad weight gain (no exhibits here). I’ll share more about my life in Edinburgh as time goes on. Let me know any specific things you want me to talk about😊.
I’ll try not to disappear for too long next time. Thank you for your constant support and patience. I love you guys!

Since 2016, Edinburgh council has slowly been rolling out on-street storage for cyclists. In the last year, the number of hangars has doubled from 100 to over 200.
64% of Edinburgh households live in flats, and we know that finding somewhere to store a bicycle is one of the more important barriers to people moving around on two wheels. With about 300,000 people in capital in such a predicament, and with 6 spots per cycle hangar… you can do the maths.
One hangar location near Stockbridge has 142 people on the waiting list.
It is therefore not a surprise that the new hangars are massively over-subscribed. The waiting list has grown to 3,400, including those in the queue for an existing hangar and those who have requested one.
This latent demand for cycling is being realised, and in a big way. As new hangars go in they become a visible part of our public realm and more and more people become aware of them.
As things stand, the council will need to install a further 560 hangars to meet demand. Over 1,000 people joined the queue in the last year or so; if replicated this year, that’s another 170 hangars required on top of that.
Yet the council only has plans for around another 160.
Each cycle hangar takes up the space taken by one car. Parking permits are a significant source of revenue for the council. But so are cycle hangars…
At full price, a cycle hangar spot costs £72 per year. That compares favourably with car parking, which is either free in most of the city, or £36.50 for a zero carbon emissions car (except in the very centre of the city, where it’s £73.70).
Taking that £36.50 figure, each hangar will generate 12 times as much revenue as a car parking spot. That doesn’t take into account maintenance costs of the hangars, but after all the negative externalities associated with cars… it’s a good investment.
Indeed, if the council were a private business, they’d push those prices up even higher to meet demand.
Cycle hangars have been so far placed in the more prosperous parts of the city; Marchmont, Newington, Bruntsfield, Portobello — you get the picture. This is efficient work from the council as most of the demand for the cycle hangars is located in these areas.
However, conscious of the social inequity of providing such infrastructure in only the richer parts of town, a number of hangars have been located in areas of high deprivation. Even better, these are provided at a subsidised cost of only £1.50 a month.
This has not been successful. Some of these hangars are those few that have not been populated by bicycles. It is my view that the barriers to cycling for those on the lowest incomes remain the relatively large capital investment associated with the bicycle itself. The low cost and low risk associated with Lothian Buses’ excellent service is difficult to beat.
An interactive map of hangars, waiting lists and demand can be found here: LINK
This article has been based on a Freedom of Information request to Edinburgh City Council, which you can find here: LINK
While there is precise location data for existing hangars, requests for hangars are made on a street-by-street basis. I have used the postcode associated with each street and used the centroid of that postcode area to map requests.

I stood at the gated entrance on Candlemaker Row of the 16th-century Greyfriars Kirkyard. The wind whipped the leafless trees, and the sky threatened to rain. The weather was suitable for exploring a graveyard, especially one that proclaims to be the most haunted graveyard in the world in one of the most haunted cities, Edinburgh, Scotland.
Although I had not been there before, there was something familiar about the place as soon as I walked in.
It was my second visit to Edinburgh, and this time, I returned in January when the hordes of tourists were gone. I had seen the city’s most well-known sights, like Edinburgh Castle, Holyrood Palace, and the Royal Mile, which left me free to explore lesser-known places.
Greyfriars Kirkyard piqued my interest as I read a list of suggested things to do in Edinburgh. The graveyard was established during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots, and was full of victims from the Black Plague and the witch hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries, in which around four thousand…

Hello again from my work world developing a new ten-year fund for communities in Edinburgh to work together as part of a wider system to work in regenerative ways to get deep into the root causes of big issues in our city— poverty, racism and climate change.
I’ve never written as consistently about one topic before — this is my 15th blog in a series about developing Regenerative Futures Fund, with another 4 in there about Funding Utopias.
In April 2024 my writing was about Inching Closer to Launch, closing off and reflecting on our wonderful co-design groups.
In September 2024 I mused about Good Hosting, Floating and Anchoring, when I was feeling grateful for all who supported the more ‘behind the scenes things’ — WHALE Arts, EVOC and Foundation Scotland.
And then more recently I reflected on working with poets on our Collective Imagination programme and our beautiful poetry anthology All That Is Needed Is A Dream.
So — here is my more general Regenerative Futures Fund update for the second half of 2024 and first part of 2025🌿
This was also shared on our Regenerative Futures Fund ‘News & Notes’ section in February 2025 — a PDF of the update copied below can be downloaded here.
1. Fund Design — Process, Participation & Programme
2. Recruitment and Team Development
3. Communications and Open Working
4. Governance Ecosystem (and Hosting)
5. Fundraising and Contracting
6. Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability and Learning (MEAL)
7. Field Building & Systems — Learning Partnerships, Sharing the Model
If anything chimes, please do get in touch
Please do get in touch if you have any questions or you’d like to get involved: Leah Black (Co-Head) — leah@foundationscotland.org.uk

Edinburgh’s charm is so idyllic, it’s been a muse to writers for centuries. It’s only fitting that this is where the Kimpton Charlotte Square sits, a serene hideaway, full to overflowing with everything needed for a romantic escape. I recently stayed two nights there on a wedding anniversary tour of Edinburgh where I found four reasons why this hotel is the most romantic in the city.
Follow the author to be notified when new luxury travel articles are published.
Close your eyes and imagine a scene from a classic piece of literature (one of the cheerier volumes). What you dreamed up likely comes very close to the Kimpton Charlotte Square. A wicker basket props up black Mary Poppins umbrellas next to a stately Georgian door. Red bicycles fitted with silver bells patiently wait for their next outing on a herringbone tile floor. A dancing fire in a massive stone fireplace warms the room and the mood. A couple chats animatedly in the library and garden greenery weaves its way from the outdoors in, bringing a taste of a summer garden with it. This was what greeted us as we explored the common rooms on our first night. Even story settings don’t get as romantic as this.
On our second night, we decided to take a dip in the indoor swimming pool. There’s nothing like a spontaneous swim, taken purely for fun (with no attempt to get a workout in) to bring up memories of the exciting first rush of love. Do try it.
When the day draws you and your love outside, Edinburgh is at your feet, literally. Kimpton Charlotte Square is in New Town (built between 1767 and 1890 while Old Town is medieval). Shops full of Harris Tweed tartan handbags and beautifully packaged shortbread biscuits, plus one-of-a-kind treasures are two to ten minutes away on foot. Edinburgh wasn’t bombed as badly as London was during WW2, so the gorgeous period architecture is laid out in unbroken ribbons along the city’s cobbled streets. The baked goods in Edinburgh are second-to-none. If you’ve never tried chocolate and caramel-topped millionaire shortbread, you haven’t lived. Don’t miss out; it will transform your expectations of dessert forever. Cabs or buses are plentiful when it’s time to go to Old Town. Or, if you don’t mind a very scenic walk, Old Town can be reached in about 20 minutes on foot. As you’re bound to get distracted constantly by fabulous shops and scenery, plan for more.
Discovering a tin full of goodies in the room was my first delightful foodie surprise. Rich chocolate bars and well-chosen savoury snacks fed my habit of late-night snacking on both nights of our stay. Even better was dinner on our second night. We ate our fill at BABA, a restaurant that feels like the best version of a Middle Eastern bazaar. BABA is a vibrantly hued maze of open areas that buzz with conversation, and intimate tables framed with heavy velvet curtains, made for a quiet meal. My hummus and pita bread was so wonderful, I nearly skipped to dessert. I’m glad I didn’t though, as the cod with grilled celeriac and cashews was tender and flavourful. My husband had the pork with red pepper ketchup, feta cheese and banana chilies, which he must have loved as he cleaned his plate.
For variety, there are two other restaurants on-site, Aizle (featuring a six-course tasting menu) and The Garden, a scenic, light-filled café that serves coffee and sandwiches until 3 PM.
After dinner and a day of exploration, I craved a hot shower and soft bed. I got both in our beautiful one-bedroom partitioned suite that overlooked the front steps of the hotel and Charlotte Square beyond. The suite’s sitting room and bedroom are separated by a partial wall under a high ceiling. Of all the room’s brilliant décor, I liked the drawing of wily rabbits best — its outright whimsy juxtaposed nicely with the downy velvet drapes and refined upholstered sofa. The super king bed’s duvet was so nice — crisp, spotless, and had just the right weight. Snuggling under it while watching TV and reliving our day surrounded by a beautiful room full of beautiful things was wonderful and terribly romantic.
As I write this, I want to go back and package up the room to bring home and make ours, but I suppose the fantasy needs to stay in Edinburgh where it fits to tailor-made perfection.
The Kimpton Charlotte Square is a fantastic hotel in a city that falls in my top three world-wide. I particularly recommend the hotel to couples looking for a romantic getaway as it is the most romantic hotel in Edinburgh. Tip: For access to the best selection of room types and seasonal specials, book directly on Kimpton Charlotte Square’s official website.
It wasn’t until I caught sight of the building that I realised I had been a guest of the hotel before, years ago. At that time it had another name. I am delighted with the improvements Kimpton has made. I liked the hotel very much before, but it is even better now, particularly in the areas of interior design and cuisine. Kudos to Kimpton!
My gratitude to Naomi Cameron of 3x1 for expertly arranging my time at the hotel. Thank you, Naomi! You’re a credit to your company.

On my way out of Edinburgh I stopped for my final EB in the land of kilts, sporrans, and Harris Tweed. My suitcase was bulging with Scotch Whiskey miniatures, a framed picture of puffins, and a natty little hat that would absolutely suit the Canberra winter, but not the Scottish Summer.
I was catching the train from Edinburgh Station down to Guildford to see my Dad before flying home to Aussie. Being so close, six hours of trains, I couldn’t possibly pass up the chance to pop in. My train wasn’t until 11am, so PLENTY of time to feast first.
I had seen the menu in the window a few days before on one of my walks and decided it looked like the sort of place that would either do a really good EB or monumentally stuff it up by trying to be too innovative.
I was seated in a booth with a brass topped table, and green velvet seats which I sank into. Looking around, there was nary a hard chair in the joint. Even the wooden dining chairs had a plush cushion to rest the weary buttocks.
I ordered a latte, orange juice, and classic Eggs Benedict that included Ayrshire Smoked Bacon, Toasted Muffin, Poached Eggs, Hollandaise Sauce. The menu kept it simple, so I thought, it going to be plain and simple.
It wasn’t, of course it wasn’t. I was in the Grand Cafe. They had the date on either side of the name. 1905. The chandeliers sparkled. The stained glass was clean. The stairs marble.
It came on a hand-turned ceramic plate, with spotlessly clean, shiny, cutlery (flatware, for the Americans). Baby spinach and toasted onion flakes adorned as garnish. The sauce, while pale, WAS HOUSE MADE!
Hallelujah.
I’ll be honest. I devoured it. It looked appetising, smelled fabulous, and tasted tangy with lemon as the acid in the sauce. The eggs, which I forgot to photograph because I was too busy scoffing them, where cooked to perfection with golden yolks and no egg snot.
After I had eaten, I used a few drinks mats to write some tanka about my Edinburgh stay. A couple of days before I had bunked off the conference to go and see some wildlife in the wild.

When you walk the charming cobbled streets of Edinburgh’s Old Town, it’s easy to fall in love with the history. The gothic spires. The storytellers. The whiskey.
But beneath your feet lies another version of the city — one that most people don’t talk about unless they’re on a ghost tour.
One that’s still very much alive in its own way.
Welcome to the Edinburg Vaults, a network of stone chambers built in the late 1700s beneath South Bridge. They were meant for businesses and storage. But the vaults were dark, damp, and poorly ventilated — so they were quickly abandoned.
But not forgotten.
Soon after, the city’s poorest moved in. Families without homes, criminals, the sick, the unwanted.
People lived — and died — in these cold, airless rooms.
Disease spread quick. Murders went unnoticed.
And when the authorities eventually sealed the vaults, many believe they buried more than just stone and wood. They buried people alive.

Liberal Arts Blog — Friday is the Joy of Art, Architecture, Design, Film, and All Things Visual Day
Today’s Topic: Edinburgh: Raphael, “The Holy Family,” Velazquez “Old Lady Frying Eggs,” and Church “Niagara”
Last week, Vienna. Two weeks ago, Stockholm. Three weeks ago, Moscow. This week, Edinburgh — as we continue the tour of European art galleries to which I have never been. The first of today’s picks is from the Italian Renaissance, the second from the Spanish Golden Age, and the third from the Hudson River School of mid-19th century America. Experts — please chime in. Correct, elaborate, elucidate.
RAPHAEL (1483–1520) “The Holy Family with the Palm Tree” (1506)
1. What is most striking about this scene is the prominence of Joseph.
2. Most Holy Family scenes have a focus on Jesus or Mary.
3. Can any experts provide any enlightenment on this score?
NB: Raphael is most famous for “The School of Athens” — one of four frescoes in the “Stanza della Segnatura” in the Apostolic Museum in the Vatican in Rome. Tragically, he died young, allegedly from too much sex, on Good Friday, 1520, which was, according to Vasari, also his birthday.
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Raphael_The_Holy_Family_with_a_Palm_Tree.jpg
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael
DIEGO VELAZQUEZ (1599–1660) “Old Lady Frying Eggs” (1618) — “chiaroscuro” and photographic realism
1. The eggs look like fried eggs from a distance but if you look closely you will see that they are swimming in a liquid and are probably better described as poached.
2. Case study in “chiaroscuro” — “with a strong light source coming in from the left illuminating the woman, her utensils and the poaching eggs, while throwing the background and the boy standing to her right into deep shadow. Here the chiaroscuro is very intense, so much so that it would be impossible to see the wall at the bottom of the painting but for the basket hanging from it; it simultaneously manages to combine the murky darkness and high contrasts of light and shadow with the use of subtle hues and a palette dominated by ochres and browns. The composition is organized as an oval with the middle figures in the nearest plane, thus drawing in the viewer.”
3. “The realism is nearly photographic and shows everyday plates, cutlery, pans, pestles, jugs and mortars, capturing the special shine on a glass surface and the light’s play on the melon carried by the boy. The boiling pan is particularly well-captured, with its reflections and the whites of the eggs. Velázquez also worked particularly hard on the detail of the two figures’ hands.”
NB: Velazquez was the great painter of the second half of the “Spanish Golden Age” (the “Siglo de Oro”) under the reign of Philip IV (1605–1665). El Greco (1541–1641) — was the master of the first half under Philip II (1527–1598).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Woman_Frying_Eggs
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez
FREDERICK CHURCH (1826–1900) “Niagara Falls, from the American Side” (1867)
1. Church was a member of the “Hudson River School” of American artists. Their theme was “sublime” nature and the “awe” it inspires.
2. Nothing captures this theme better than Niagara Falls which became a metaphor for the “manifest destiny” of the United States.
3. This is Church’s largest painting (8 feet by 7 feet) and the only one of his paintings in a European collection.
NB: Church’s most influential rendering of Niagara (from the Canadian side) was painted ten years earlier. See second link below.

That the love of typewriters is a thing, becomes evident from Somsubhra Banerjee’s article that inspired this one. Such passion for outdated technology does not come naturally to me. Yet, I came to appreciate the charming appearance of typewritten verse in 2022 after my visit to Typewronger Books in Edinburgh, Scotland.
It was not love at first sight. I slowly descended the steps to an unpretentious-looking bookstore’s entrance. In true Harry Potteresque style that is so characteristic of Edinburgh, Scotland, the “entrance” gave away absolutely nothing. I might as well have opened what looked like a basement door and found myself in Diagon Alley on the other side!
Little did I know, that I would spend the next two hours with family rummaging through entertaining accounts written by independent writers, some graduates of the University of Edinburgh’s famous creative writing programs, and many other intriguing but unknown gems. Well, that shouldn’t be surprising in the world’s first city designated as a “City of Literature” by UNESCO.
It turns out that this bookstore specialises in selling, but also repairing old typewriters. That someone would take the pains to get an old dysfunctional typewriter repaired for a cost sounded absurd to me.
The book wizard at the front desk was kind enough to share snippets of how many writers still prefer to write on typewriters. Or how he has a typewriter there which when my daughter click-clacked, would generate a tweet! And, how he had sold metres and metres of books as “home office decoration” during the great golden age of Zoom (2020–22)!
What fascinated me the most, however, was how captivated I was with all the typewriters they had on display. Turquoise, mint green, plain white but also the classic grandfather typewriters — black with black keys and golden alphabets etched on them.
Since that rainy afternoon, seeing typewritten words on the paper now mesmerises me. Those stark black and white angular letters seem to have a personality of their own. Have you read verses of poetry that just feel more alive on Instagram because they are typewritten? There is magic in them. If I can now see it, could this be some kind of literary spiritual awakening I underwent at Typewronger?
Typewriters haven’t gone completely out of fashion despite their more sophisticated and user-friendly competitors such as laptops and tablets. Surprisingly, they have held on to their niche and achieved cult status. It makes me wonder if some part of our current less efficient, cumbersome, but infinitely more charming and deeper way of writing, will unexpectedly preserve itself despite the advent of easier, lazier AI tools. Anyway, I digress…
It makes me wonder why. Perhaps, a typewriter, the way it feels to exert your fingers on its keys and the resulting click-clack sound allows a writer to feel like a music composer. After all, music is just a more mystical form of writing, isn’t it?
Or does it allow her to take on the identity of Hemingway, or perhaps, Anne Lamott, as types away? Similar to the purpose a bottle of rum would serve, or perhaps, an old, white, soft-beyond-description t-shirt. Is it a getting-into-character exercise for literary minds? Or does it evoke nostalgia for a lost, golden era of literature that she painfully tries to access, but only through its relics — typewriters?
Who knows? Do tell me if you give writing on a typewriter a shot one fine day. And if you were to bust it, you now know where to get it repaired!

It is Festival season in Edinburgh. Tens of thousands of visitors have flocked in the city, from everywhere, many from abroad. The streets are crowded, buses cannot keep to their schedules, and most people react to the misery of long queues and delays cheerfully. I think there is the acceptance that if one wished to live in one of the most civilised cities in Europe, there must be a small price to pay. Coming out of the Assembly, where I had been to watch The Life and Times of Michael K, based on J.M.Coetzee’s novel, it was nearly 3.00 p.m. and I had not had lunch yet. So when I reached the bus stop just outside the Central Library, my heart sank when I saw a long queue waiting. I checked the electronic indicator, and was not surprised that it was not in operation, and therefore had no information about how long a wait there would be. An elderly lady, a sprightly nonagenarian, next to whom I found myself caught the little grimace I made, and nodded at me in sympathy, and I thought that to pass the time, one could indulge in a little conversation. You’ve been to a show, ma’am? I asked. Her eyes twinkled, as no doubt she too welcomed a chat to pass the time. No, she responded, but she was at the Usher Hall last night to catch that Korean orchestra playing Mozart. Was it good? I asked. It was superlative, she said, but had more to say.
‘I marvel at these people who are open to an alien culture and produce such excellent work,’ she said, ‘and ask myself, What do we know of Asian culture?’ Yes, I responded, the Koreans, like the Japanese and the Chinese, are excellent interpreters of Western classical music. Had I seen any good shows this year? She asked. I told her about Michael K, and added that I too had seen a delightful Korean opera, Trojan Woman, and said that it was one of the best shows that I had caught in the last few years.Yes, she said, they are a very cultured people. I then thought I should pay her a compliment.
‘I am surprised and pleased that you think so,’ I said.
‘But I was born in Penang,’ she blurted out, ‘my father was district officer in the thirties.’ And she told me that she had lived in Malaya until she was twelve, and then spent time in Jakarta as well. To my surprise she revealed that she used to be fluent in bahasa. My son was in Bogor for two or three years, I said, teaching TEFL. I had to add that my father too had spent time in Indonesia in the twenties.
Suddenly her eyes lit up again, and she said, ‘Oh I have to tell you this, it’s so marvellous.’ She had been shopping, and when it was time to pay, realised that she did not have her purse any more. She was upset and panicking, and to her amazement a young fellow came towards her brandishing her purse, which he had picked down the road. ‘Aren’t people marvellous?’ I had to tell her my own story of how, travelling from Lagos to Kontagora, a 15 hour journey I realised that I too had lost my purse.
‘I informed the driver, and he made an announcement, and someone stood up and walked towards me with my purse. Is it yours?’
‘So you must have travelled a fair bit too?’ I nodded, and told her that I came from Mauritius_’
That’s where the dodo came from?
The dodo and me, I added facetiously.
‘Oh,’ she asked suddenly, I know it’s a stupid question, but seeing you come from Mauritius, do you know dentist Chong Kwan? He used to be my dentist until last year when he sadly passed away.’ I had heard the name in Mauritius, and besides I remember my dentist brother talking about a dentist Chong Kwan. I figured out that her dentist Chong Kwan must have been the son of my brother’s colleague.
And I filled her in on what I had done since I came to the UK in 1959. Then a Number 27 bus appeared.
‘Now that I’ve been enjoying talking to you, I’d have been happy to wait some more,’ she said. Although I was quite hungry, I agreed with her.
‘Hope we can find seats together,’ she said, ‘because I’ve been enjoying our talk.’
Sadly, as the bus was fairly packed, she found a seat in front and I at the back. It seemed like an anti-climax, but two stops down her neighbour alighted, and I was able to move in with her. We continued together until Tollcross, where we both got out, she having decided to walk home, whilst I too tired to walk opted for another bus.
‘I’ll look out for you, and you do the same, we’re bound to meet again,’ she said cheerfully.

From Abuja to Edinburgh: my 1st semester experience as a Mastercard Foundation Scholar at the University of Edinburgh,https://medium.com/@mirabellemorah/from-abuja-to-edinburgh-my-1st-semester-experience-as-a-mastercard-foundation-scholar-at-the-80b3fc2ec550,"Sign up

This will humorously walk you through some of my experiences these past 3 months as a Scholar, from settling into Edinburgh to being blown away by heavy winds. See the end for scholarship application tips.
My first few weeks in the UK were both exciting and uneasy.
The Mastercard Foundation team at the University of Edinburgh have been incredible and helpful in everything. Once I got the scholarship, they guided me in applying to the university, gave travel guidance (before arriving) and helped me settle-in (on arrival).
Before I moved to start my postgrad, the past months were not easy. I experienced an armed robbery attack in the middle of the night (funny part in hindsight was that the first thing I hid was my passport). I went from that to being exhausted in the months that followed, to overthinking, etc. So arriving in Scotland, jumping into a new environment, new system and getting used to the pattern and methods of postgraduate lectures were not things I immediately settled into. It took two months for my beating heart to calm down. As they say, it’s not (only) the situation that makes you unhappy; your thoughts about it count.
I’ve explored several places in Scotland. We had a calming retreat at the Burn in Glenesk, Brechin. I visited the University of St. Andrews to watch a Rugby Match (both courtesy of Mastercard Foundation). Then I visited Glasgow to spend an evening with Gerry Higgins (Social Enterprise World Forum’s founder), his family, and Maeve Curtin.
Before Edinburgh (UK), I’d already visited circa 12/13 countries, but I’ve never been used to the transport systems of many places. So I’m slowly learning (because I walk to most of my destinations) to use Edinburgh’s public transportation, from trams to trains to buses.
As a Nigerian, you know all that hassle of looking for how to convert your naira to USD and how to buy stuff on Amazon or pay for some Apple subscription etc? Nah! That stuff is hectic abeg! It was a relief to get a multi-currency card in the UK that allowed me access different currencies. I could use a Revolut card to buy groceries in the UK with GBP and use it in the Netherlands to move around in EUR. Nice stuff.
An imaginary bank card I designed for “Bank of Womandla”. This was inspired by my course on Entrepreneurial Finance as well as one of my professors, Francis Green who encouraged us to imagine borrowing from “Bank of Francis” to fund our business ideas.
Using MTN? Remember to keep your MTN line. Here’s how.
You must find your own way of learning and dealing with course load. My postgraduate studies are on innovation and entrepreneurship, and before attending lectures and seminars, I need to read several papers. Some things that help me are to:
“This presentation was led by a fantastic first speaker who really nailed the presentation of the pitch. Ably supported by the second speaker, the pitch presentation was authoritative and slick. The video was really helpful in that it showed that attention had been given to how the pitch was to be presented…”
– Part of the academic feedback we received
Naturally, the Mastercard Scholars programme is already a HUGE community and network. The Foundation’s team organises several leadership lab sessions for scholars to learn. A Chevening scholar once attended an end-of-year event I co-organised with Kish (my fellow scholar representative) and said he liked the community we had amongst us. I’ve always believed in the power of mutually connecting with people beyond my studies, learning from others, sharing knowledge and strategically showing up for things.
So far:
I’ve been in the UK for 3 months. I haven’t seen snow in my part of Edinburgh (yet). The wind has tried to blow me away several times. I don’t know how to use a vending machine yet. I make better illustrations now. I’m better at making business valuations. And one of my favourite actions remains to keep asking more questions.
I am a huge advocate for rest. I budget heavy doses of rest and sleep in between all of my hard work. I believe in “less is more.” I believe in prayers and mindfulness. I believe in play, and in disconnecting to recharge.
P.S. for the title, no I didn’t live in Abuja. I flew out of Nigeria, from Abuja to Edinburgh.

Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, is very recognized, I would say, for its fascinating history and breathtaking architecture. It’s obviously also the perfect jumping-off point for seeing Scotland’s lovely scenery and cute towns. For anyone wanting to sneak away for a bit, there actually are a handful of cracking half day trips from Edinburgh where you can see Scotland’s highlights, so it’s almost effortless to squeeze them into your schedule. Whether you’re crazy about nature, into old stories, or very fancy seeing something a bit different, you, like your travel companions, might unearth just the thing not far from town. Let’s take a peep at, like, five ace half-day outings around Edinburgh!
Near Edinburgh, the Scottish Highlands are rather unmissable. You could grab a half-day tour, arguably offering spectacular sights featuring the mountains, lochs and valleys. This outing is truly grand, specifically for outdoorsy types and anyone needing some calm. A fair few tours drop you at spots I feel are well-known such as Loch Ness and Ben Nevis, basically to give you, like your travel partners, a glimpse of the magnificent countryside Scotland is so celebrated for.
Stirling Castle, not far from Edinburgh on the train, is so perfect for folk who find the olden days fascinating. It’s that sort of ancient fort providing views into the history of Scottish royalty because of its super well looked-after buildings and cool displays. You, like your family, could uncover the Wallace Monument, commemorating Scottish hero William Wallace, so nearby, too it’s almost too simple. Mixed together, these spots turn into an epic half-day adventure bubbling with Scottish tradition.
South Queensferry is likely just the ticket if scenic coasts grab you. Very nearby Edinburgh by car, this delightful village offers some grandstand seats looking at the Forth Bridge and the waterways dotted all around. Have a stroll on the waterfront, taste local fish at places to eat. You, like your friends, could possibly even hop on a boat for a peek at Inchcolm Island which, I guess, shows off a seriously good-condition abbey.
Another prime candidate for a half-day jolly around Edinburgh, so it seems, is the gorgeous Scottish Borders; Melrose Abbey, more precisely. This awesome ruin, built back in the 1100s, really brings home some fancy stonework coupled with some fascinating tales. Wrapped by gorgeous fields, the abbey seems grand for taking easy walks. You could perhaps peep around the amazing wee town of Melrose, known, I think, for its adorable shops and cafés.
You are likely to discover Linlithgow highly worthwhile! Loads of Scottish monarchs came into the world in its superb Linlithgow Palace, one of its claims to fame. A calming wander is made oh-so simple, very much because a lovely loch almost cuddles the palace. Loaded with stores and places to chow down, Linlithgow town alone gives a friendly spot to loosen up in, actually appreciating its character. Anyone landing here, should call in at Linlithgow railway station as Edinburgh is pretty handy that way.
Scotland’s pureness, past experiences, or culture might just show off what these first-rate half day trips from Edinburgh mean to those shy on spare time. Destinations have unique snapshots from inside Scotland that include the wonderful Highlands, or olden Stirling Castle or sweet-as-pie hamlets local to this great city. Bag-packing plus photos at the ready and it, it sounds just about time for people out of Edinburgh be discovering fantastic vistas.
Outdoor exploration hits a high through spring into summer; however changing leaf settings are extremely picturesque if seen over autumn-esque weather.
Most sites appear reachable thru public options like train travels, buses along with charted round travels. These may just come together well during quick timelines.
Quick excursions nearby could sum up as two locale stop offs throughout single half sun cycle of span in journey’s length; preferably narrow sights may have guests experience fullest joy thru focusing attention specifically one site tops!

Upon my first meal in Edinburgh, I noticed many cultural differences between the dining experience in the U.S. versus that in the U.K. We’re not talking about the food here, we’re talking about the overall atmosphere of a Scottish pub.
The dialect between Americans and Scots is very different. In both countries, the server’s job is to come up to the tables and ask if they can get you drinks or food yet, or if you need more time to decide what you’d like. At The Abbey Pub, I overheard a table with Scotts, and they had cut off the server’s spiel, by saying, “I know what I want.” In America, it would be considered rude to cut off someone’s sentence. We treat servers with more respect by waiting for them to finish speaking, then responding with, “We know what we would like!” or “I think we are ready.”
The second difference in dining etiquette is the volume at which you speak. While restaurants can be loud in America, typically, all the tables’ voices mesh and it’s just overall chatter. In a Scottish pub, some tables are quiet, and some that the Scotts are speaking very loudly, and using very intense language.
(Photo sourced from Tripadvisor.com).
In The Abbey, there was a table near us of what appeared to be four Scotts or two couples. The women…

I was in the amazing Edinburgh Royal Botanic Gardens in April admiring the newly emerging spring daffodils when I had an epiphany, trees do in fact go to heaven, who knew!
A proponent of the daffodil is the end of life charity, Marie Curie who adopted it as their logo in 1986 offering hope, courage and support to all those who are touched by them. They started life delivering radiotherapy to women in the 30s.
She wore her yellow sun-bonnet,
She wore her greenest gown;
She turned to the south wind
And curtsied up and down.
She turned to the sunlight
And shook her yellow head,
And whispered to her neighbour:
“Winter is dead.”
Daffodowndilly, a poem by A.A. Milne
The first yellow daffodils of spring are a precious time of year for me. As A.A. Milne rightly points out they signify the end of a cold, black and white winter, a chance to wave goodbye to bad weather and offer a sense of timely rebirth with hope and a new beginning for the upcoming year.
Their arrival, a perennial gift from nature with their much-needed boost of colour is all I need from a faith, a non-spiritual conviction for me that never seems to disappoint, yellow on yellow, year on year and with impeccable timing! An unlikely yellow antidote to death, dying and goodbye!
The plant’s ‘bulbus’ (Latin) has a layer of dried skin, which serves as protection, and helps ensure that the bulb remain moist and properly insulated. There’s also another important function that it serves. Not only does this layer serve as a defence for this year’s plant, but it also carries the embryo for the plant or flower that’s going to bloom the following year.
Understanding that different kinds of daffodils follow their own pace is important. Growth primarily depends on the temperature of the soil as well as the amount of daylight that the plant receives and therefore the length of the day. Up here in Scotland we wait a month or more longer than in London where I grew up, for their arrival.
In the northern hemisphere they flower in spring and down in the southern hemisphere in our autumn, their spring. It’s magical stuff!
The daffodil plant generally thrives when the temperatures in the soil are between 50/60 degrees. As the sun begins to spend more time in the sky and the days begin to lengthen, the plant starts to grow more quickly.
Brodie Castle on the Moray Firth is one of the best places to see daffodils. They have a world-famous collection of well over 300 varieties and these always flower very late and are often at their best in late April and early May. I always enjoy a trip over to Brodie, located between Forres and Nairn just to see this yellow carnival at one of the National Trust for Scotland’s best kept secrets. Some varieties are around 150 years old like my favourite one above.
Another amazing display of yellow occurs around the same time, although with climate change it does flower from time to time all year-round, is from gorse.
Otherwise known as Whin and Furse and also Fuzzy Bush it starts its major flowering in late March and April and lasts here well into June. The overt coconut smell when in full bloom on a warm day is a very recognisable scent, one that you can also cook with if you flavour a dish with the flower petals.
It really is a ubiquitous, invasive plant in Northern Scotland especially by the coast and according to BBC’s Spring Watch; whom I tweeted this question last year, it flowers at odd times all year round simply to benefit from any early pollinators that are hanging around, out of season, who knew?
It also importantly has its own flower fairy:
When gorse is out of blossom,
(Its prickles bare of gold)
‘Then kissing’s out of fashion’,
Said country-folk of old.
Now Gorse is in its glory
In May when skies are blue,
But when its time is over,
Whatever shall we do?
O dreary would the world be,
With everyone grown cold —
Forlorn as prickly bushes
Without their fairy gold!
But this will never happen:
At every time of year
You’ll find one bit of blossom —
A kiss from someone dear!
The ‘Gorse Fairy’ is one of Cicely Mary Barker’s flower fairies that were first published in 1923.There are 170 original and individually accurate botanic illustrations, coupled with charming fairy images based on real children from Cicely’s sister’s nursery school. Each one also has a unique poem attached as above. The picture shown is on my wall at home, the verse in my book!
If you play golf on any of the world-famous links courses here, the ones played by the sea on the sand dunes and your ball lands in a gorse bush, you will have another, unmentionable name for this plant. As a rule of thumb and one which sadly missed gold commentator Peter Allis once advised, if you actually find it, take it out, drop it under penalty and ‘take your punishment son’. Never try to play it, you will regret it!
As with the daffodils, how these plants work out when to flower, never ceases to amaze me. Other yellow spring coastal gifts here are bird-foot trefoil, broom (often confused with gorse but safer!), aconites and the common dandelion.
The after-life of a tree
While once again in the Edinburgh Botanic Garden I also came across the following sign explaining how old trees that die do in fact have an ‘after-life’ or go to ‘tree heaven’ if you like. This very old sweet chestnut started to die back a few years ago and so the plant undertakers at Inverleith cut it down and left some of the main trunk in situ and the large boughs on the ground providing a habitat for other life such as bats, insects and birds.
However, this tree has suddenly lifted the lid on its coffin and surprisingly this spring, some new shoots and leaves have appeared. You can’t it seems keep a good tree down and yet another great example of nature providing hope and rebirth for the future despite looking death full in the face.
A.A. Milne — Writer and Poet
Alan Alexander Milne (1882 –1956) was a British author, poet, and playwright best known for his books about the bear Winnie-the-Pooh along with Christopher Robin, Tigger, Piglet and others. Christopher Robin was actually his son and who after a trip to the Zoo in London Milne wrote the original Winnie the Pooh story based on a tame bear, that they saw there named Winnipeg.
Milne was primarily a playwright before the massive success of Winnie-the-Pooh largely overshadowed all his previous work. Milne served in both World Wars, as a lieutenant in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment in the First World War and as a captain in the Home Guard in the Second World War. despite being a pacifist. He oddly had a degree in Maths whereby Trinity College, Cambridge, was his alma mater and was a useful cricketer. He bequeathed his original Pooh writings to the college.
Based on the fact that many of Milne’s philosophical sayings, poems and Winnie-the-Pooh quotes are often recited at funerals which I’ll come to later, he too saw the arrival of daffodils as a new beginning as per his poem at the start of this blog, added to the fact he was overtly a pacifist it seems that he did not speak out much on the subject of religion at all.
He did however, use religious terms to explain his decision, while remaining a pacifist, to join the Home Guard: ‘In fighting Hitler we are truly fighting the Devil, the Anti-Christ … Hitler was a crusader against God’
His best-known comment on the subject was remembered on his death:
The Old Testament is responsible for more atheism, agnosticism, disbelief — call it what you will — than any book ever written; it has emptied more churches than all the counter-attractions of cinema, motor bicycle and golf course.
He also wrote in the poem ‘Explained’:
Elizabeth Ann
Said to her Nan:
Please will you tell me how God began?
Somebody must have made Him.
So who could it be, ‘cos I want to know?
So, it seems that Milne was probably agnostic and veering on a non-believer but one who following a pretty religious upbringing in the late nineteenth century found it hard to completely let go as it was in those days and explaining that out loud, even harder.
It’s still difficult for me to tell my mother that I am an atheist and have been for many years following a similar childhood, where she is quite in disbelief and overtly saddened by my views.
Anyway, this blog is about the rebirth that nature brings us each year and one that is quite independent of any otherworldly beliefs and one that the ‘Scottish Enlightenment’ here began to address in the mid-eighteenth century questioning religion and allowing freedom of debate on subjects such as art, politics, science, medicine, engineering and especially philosophy that was, in those days difficult to contemplate in public.
That blog is here if you want to read it: Money can’t buy love, as the Beatles once suggested but it can buy a better death. However, contemplating ‘assisted-dying’ might well become part of a new ‘Scottish Enlightenment’ very soon!
https://medium.com/@DuncanHynd/money-cant-buy-love-as-the-beatles-once-suggested-but-it-can-buy-a-better-death-202150c6d2db
So yes, I definitely do firmly believe in yellow these days!
However, with a nod to the divine, it seems that Hindus see yellow as the colour of knowledge and learning. Lord Vishnu’s dress is yellow symbolizing his representation of knowledge.
Lord Krishna and Ganesha also wear yellow dresses while both Christians and Hindus associate yellow, seen as the colour of fire with renewal and purity and so while not the same, seemingly not a million miles away from my amateur philosophy above!
Winnie-the-Pooh
Milne’s bear was so much more than the famous animated hero of our childhoods and one that many Disney cartoons later featured. He and his friends were very much into philosophy with Milne using the characters to express many of his own beliefs. You probably wouldn’t have thought about using Pooh bear to find quotes about death, dying or saying goodbye to someone you love and so I have selected a few here that are in line with this article, secular in nature.
Death:
‘If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day, so I never have to live without you.’
‘If ever there is tomorrow when we’re not together, there is something you must always remember. You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think. But the most important thing is, even if we’re apart… I’ll always be with you.’
‘Wherever they go, and whatever happens to them on the way, in that enchanted place on the top of the forest, a little boy and his bear will always be playing.’
‘I used to believe in forever, but forever’s too good to be true.’
Life:
‘Some people care too much. I think it’s called love.’
‘How do you spell love?’ said Piglet, ‘You don’t spell it, you feel it, said Pooh
‘Rivers know this, there is no hurry. We shall get there some day.’
‘Sometimes,’ said Pooh, ‘the smallest things take up the most room in your heart’
Goodbye:
‘How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.’
‘But, of course, it isn’t really good-bye, because the forest will always be there… and anybody who is friendly with bears can find it.’
Airbnb offers a new feature when booking holidays, one where a death has occurred of a famous person at some time in the past!
In his writing prime, A.A. Milne lived at Cotchford Farm in Hartfield, East Sussex, the house, gardens and surrounding woods and country side inspired his children’s books. However, it is now available as a holiday let on Airbnb, but that is not the whole story!
The large country house has gained notoriety as it was also the home of Rolling Stones original member Brian Jones, who was found dead in the outdoor swimming pool in 1969, his death officially recorded as ‘misadventure’.
Around the grounds it is said that there are statues of the main characters in Milne’s books and poems, including Christopher Robin, Owl and an old sundial with images of Piglet, Tigger and Roo that also features words such as, ‘This warm, sunny spot belongs to Pooh, and here he wonders what it’s time to do’.
The Airbnb listing stated that you can ‘stay in the former home of A.A. Milne, Christopher Robin and Winnie The Pooh’ while mentioning that the property was a welcoming family home and historic building while Brian Jones was among other owners since the Milne family had it.
Some pictures located in the house have seemingly documented the chaos associated with the finding of Jones’s body in the pool and others showed Jones standing with the statues. It also seems that Christopher Robin, was not a great fan of being included in his father’s books and they sadly went their separate ways before Milne died there in 1956. An ill-fated property perhaps?
The Marie Curie charity began by delivering radiotherapy to women in 1930, who knew! They use the daffodil as the icon for their amazing end of lifecare charity for a reason.
This charity is the leading one in the UK that deals with dying, death and goodbye but it had roots in a subject close to my heart.
The Marie Curie charity really started life at the Marie Curie Hospital in Hampstead, London in 1930 where the ‘radiological treatment of women suffering from cancer and allied diseases’ was undertaken in what was a very early, specialist radiotherapy centre. Staffed only by women it had facilities for both radium and x-ray therapy with in and out-patient facilities. Amazingly in 1944, most of the hospital was razed to the ground in the blitz whereby their radium radioactive sources, safely stored in steel containers took, it seems three weeks to find in the rubble, probably much to the relief of the local RPA, if indeed they had one in those days!
In 1948 the rebuilt hospital parted ways from the newly born NHS, which Bevan had famously described as a ‘great and novel undertaking’ so that the name of Marie Curie could be established in the charitable medical field. Known initially as the ‘Marie Curie International Memorial Foundation’ it primarily investigated the needs of cancer patients and the best ways of helping them.
The first Marie Curie Home for cancer patients was opened in 1952, based in an old National Trust property in Fife while during the 1950s and early 1960s, the charity opened a further nine Marie Curie Homes in specially adapted but old buildings all over the UK while the charity’s main remit was to help cancer patients who needed nursing directly at home. Another aim was to make a substantial contribution to cancer research, especially into its causes and treatments.
From the 1960s onwards all Marie Curie Homes would be specially designed and newly built. The first was opened in Belfast in 1965. A similar, larger building followed in Edinburgh in 1966.
Their 24/7, day and night nursing service for cancer patients continued to grow throughout the 1960s while further specialist, dedicated laboratories opened for cancer research work.
From the early 1980s, ‘Marie Curie Homes’ and later the newly named ‘Marie Curie Hospices’ moved away from providing long-term nursing care to cancer patients, and became increasingly focused on hospice care, a field that they are now renowned for world-wide with the ability to offer palliative care for more patients, who were more seriously ill and usually for shorter periods of time.
The link to daffodils began in Scotland in 1986 in what was termed their first ‘daffodil appeal’ using live daffodils as a hand out similar to the poppy appeal. This continued to grow throughout the 1990s when they incorporated the daffodil into their logo, where it remains today.
They developed innovative fundraising partnerships with major companies and opened their first high street charity shops while in 1995, the Marie Curie Memorial Foundation became Marie Curie Cancer Care.
They launched their first national campaign called ‘supporting the choice to die at home’ and diversified to allow for the treatment of all terminal illnesses and not a charity just aimed at cancer patients. They successfully helped more terminally ill people remain in their homes, reducing the need for emergency hospital treatment, allowing more people to die at home and saving the NHS money.
Research efforts were focused on finding better ways of caring for terminally ill people and their families through palliative care research programs while establishing a major grants programme, awarding around £1 million every year to fund palliative care research projects, on a competitive basis becoming one of the UK’s leading funders of palliative care research.
In October 2014, the name was reduced to simply ‘Marie Curie’, to reflect the work to support people affected by all terminal illnesses.
Their main focus today is to assist people to make the right plans and preparations and to find the information and support they need when confronted with dying themselves or for family and friends facing bereavement. This includes prioritising social inclusion as some communities they have discovered get disproportionately less support than others at the end of life.
The Marie Curie Policy
‘We’re determined to fight for a world where everyone gets the best experience they possibly can at the end of their lives’.
Their ‘Better end of life’ report is here if you want to find out more on this amazing charity:
https://www.mariecurie.org.uk/policy/better-end-of-life-2022
And then the swallows return, the bluebells come out and we move on again!
PS. I wanted to add a section on music, an important part of my own life and am aware of the use of yellow in a few well-known hits, The Beatles and Coldplay come to mind. However, just as I write this latest piece, UK rapper ‘Big Zuu’ who also doubles as a brilliant ‘pop-up’ celebrity chef on TV has released his new song, its’ simply called Yellow! It’s great, shows off his musical talent in a different light and so I simply had to include it!

Hello from the world I’m embroiled in, where I’m way deeper than knee-deep in developing a new long-term unrestricted £15m pooled fund that shifts power to local people to make decisions on a cohort of community orgs in Edinburgh to lead place-based systems change across some big themes - poverty, racial inequality and injustice and climate change (phew — and yes I do have a bad habit of long sentences!).
Last week I wrote an update and thanks to our amazing learning groups as we come to the end of this chapter of co-design. I also have shared this with a group of people who have been advising, following along, supporting and cheering on.
Reminder that our learning groups have been a mix of individuals via End Poverty Edinburgh, community organisations, and funders and public sector partners — if you’d like to read more here is a blog that talks about this.
After I sent that I thought… I have an almost ready-made blog here.
So here is the (slightly edited) April 2024 update on Regenerative Futures Fund:
From March 2024 we have moved into a new phase of the project which means bringing the learning groups as they have been since the late 2022 / early 2023, to a close.
In March 2024 we created a condensed version of the detailed operational plan, which can be accessed here on the EVOC website.
We are also hoping to do an open Q&A session for community organisations in Edinburgh soon.
A few updates (and thanks!):
As ever, keen to chat with anyone who would like to meet to talk any aspect through, you’d like to get involved. Amazingly, there is SO much more to share than what’s in this update (I’ve missed so many things, it probably needs another blog!) — but I’m always to happy to chat over anything here and missing bits.
An information / conversation session coming soon — for Edinburgh community orgs.
And our ‘funders progressing proposals’ group has been meeting regularly since January if anyone from funding orgs would like to know more about that in terms of joining as a funding partner by contributing to the pooled fund.
Phew!
Finally — In 2023 I set myself a challenge to do 42 swims in my 42nd year and happy to report I am on track although I will be in the sea 4 times between now and next Saturday! Happy to have achieved a wee personal goal alongside a busy work year, and look forward to more swims in my 43rd year and beyond. Here is a pic of my favourite local swimming spot in early April ❤️
Please do email me on leah.black@evoc.org.uk or find me on LinkedIn (that’s where things seem to be happening now) if you’d like to chat 😁

3/4/2024
As decentralization becomes a central theme within the blockchain community, there’s an increasing recognition of the need to systematically evaluate the levels of decentralization within blockchain networks. In response to this need, the University of Edinburgh has spearheaded the creation of the Edinburgh Decentralization Index (EDI). This initiative aims to provide a detailed and open-source framework for evaluating blockchain networks, highlighting the industry’s shift towards distributed ecosystems and emphasizing the critical need for transparency and standardization in blockchain assessments.
On March 1st, 2024, the unveiling of the EDI Dashboard’s alpha version represented a significant step forward in blockchain transparency. Spearheaded by the University of Edinburgh and funded by a grant from Input Output Global (IOG), this open-source index was a result of a collaborative effort with multiple universities. By pooling their diverse academic insights and technical expertise, the partnership aimed to ensure the tool’s relevance and adaptability across different blockchain contexts.
The Decentralization Index is crafted to be objective and unbiased, with the aim of developing into an industry-wide accepted benchmark for assessing decentralization as it progresses over time.
The Edinburgh Decentralization Index (EDI) employs a variety of metrics to evaluate the decentralization levels of Layer 1 blockchains, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, Ethereum, Litecoin, Tezos, and Zcash. Understanding these metrics can help stakeholders assess the robustness and fairness of different blockchain networks.
Nakamoto Coefficient: This metric indicates the minimum number of entities required to control over 50% of mining or staking power, thus highlighting potential vulnerabilities in the network’s decentralization. A higher Nakamoto Coefficient suggests a more resilient and distributed network, making it a crucial measure for assessing security against collusion or attacks.
Gini Coefficient: By measuring the inequality within the distribution of block production, the Gini coefficient helps identify the balance of power within the network. A lower Gini coefficient indicates a more equitable distribution, which is essential for ensuring that no single entity has disproportionate control or influence over the network.
Shannon Entropy: This measure of information entropy quantifies the unpredictability and diversity of block producers. Higher Shannon entropy suggests a more decentralized network, reflecting a varied and unpredictable block production that enhances network security and fairness.
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI): The HHI measures market concentration to evaluate the diversity of block producers. Low HHI values denote a decentralized network with a balanced distribution of power among participants, which is vital for preventing dominance by any single entity.
Theil Index: This index measures the redundancy in a population, with lower values indicating a more equal distribution of block production. By assessing the diversity of participation in the network, the Theil index provides insights into the network’s decentralization and operational fairness.
Max Power Ratio: Representing the proportion of blocks produced by the most dominant entity, this metric sheds light on the extent of control exerted by the largest block producer. A lower max power ratio is preferable for a healthy, decentralized ecosystem, ensuring no single participant overly influences the network.
Tau-Decentralization Index: This index measures the concentration of power by identifying the minimum number of entities controlling more than a specific fraction (e.g., 66%) of mining or staking power. It offers a nuanced view of network control, essential for understanding deeper layers of decentralization beyond the majority control.
These metrics collectively offer a multi-dimensional view of blockchain decentralization, providing valuable insights for users, developers, and regulators to understand and improve the distributed ecosystems of various blockchains.
The Edinburgh Decentralization Index (EDI) aims to reshape the blockchain landscape by providing a standardized approach to evaluating decentralization. This could significantly impact the future of blockchain technology, potentially paving the way for widespread adoption. As businesses, institutions, and nation-states begin utilizing blockchains for various purposes like identity management, payment systems, and governance, it could lead to increased adoption of blockchain technologies across both public and private sectors. This, in turn, would drive innovation and enhance efficiency.
By offering clear metrics for decentralization, the EDI facilitates more informed decisions by governments and organizations. For instance, a country might choose to adopt a blockchain like Cardano for its stablecoin initiative. Such applications could enhance public trust in blockchain and stimulate broader usage across various sectors.
Furthermore, with the EDI placing decentralization at the forefront, current and future blockchain systems are likely to be encouraged to become more decentralized and incorporate features such as on-chain governance. This emphasis on decentralization could lead to increased adoption of blockchain technologies for both public and private applications, thereby driving innovation and efficiency.
As the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry focuses more on decentralization in the future, the development of the Edinburgh Decentralization Index (EDI) by the University of Edinburgh will play a crucial role and lay the foundation for future metrics by which blockchains are measured. Moving forward, with the EDI emphasizing decentralization, it will be poised to encourage the adoption of more decentralized approaches within blockchain systems, fostering innovation and efficiency across both public and private applications.

A week’s adventure loop from Edinburgh
Venturing out on a cycle tour in August 2020 as Scotland gradually emerges from the coronavirus lockdown was a complicated decision, fraught with factors we’d never had to consider on bicycle trips before. First the question of whether we should even leave home for a week, and add our needs for accommodation, food, and facilities to the burden placed on other towns. Then, whether we could manage proper handwashing and social distancing from the saddle. And not least, if we were to encounter any injuries or difficulties along the way, could we manage that ourselves without putting others at risk?
The choice to travel during a pandemic is an individual one, based on personal circumstances, capacities, and acceptance of risk. We were certain we didn’t want to board a train or a plane unnecessarily, but a self-supported bicycle camping trip seemed a reasonable form of recreation, and although we planned to be away for a week we were never more than 60 miles away from home in case we needed to return quickly. We packed our face coverings, hand sanitiser, puncture repair tools, and first-aid kit; counted ourselves extremely fortunate to be in good health with time off from work; and hit the road.
Day 1 encompassed 40 miles from Edinburgh down to Innerleithen, following the brilliant National Cycle Network Route 1 along traffic-free paths and quiet roads out of the city, over the Moorfoot Hills and down into a beautiful valley beside the Leithen Water. It was a hot, pre-thunderstorm day and our legs were decidedly unused to hills after being inside for months, but it was still a joyful experience to finally be released from the cramped confines of the city and be flying along on two wheels.
In Innerleithen we visited with friends, and the next morning had a lovely breakfast outdoors at the Café Sitooterie.
Notes on the route: brilliant off-road cycle paths (converted from former railway lines so mostly flat) all the way from Edinburgh to Bonnyrigg. From Bonnyrigg the route is on-road on minor B roads with little traffic. No villages or services for 20 miles until Innerleithen; we picked up sandwiches and snacks at the Bonnyrigg Co-op.
Day 2 took us from Innerleithen down to the Ruberslaw Wild Woods Camping site a few miles from Denholm. We followed NCN Route 1 along a gorgeous riverside path and through quiet woods, rolling up and down hills to Melrose. Melrose is a lovely town with an historic Abbey (one of the stops on the Four Abbeys local cycle loop) but it was closed under coronavirus restrictions. The town itself was quite busy so we stopped at another Co-op to buy some bagels and peanut butter (by now our classic bike touring lunch menu) along with groceries for a camp dinner, and had a picnic in Gibson Park.
Notes on the route: between Caddonfoot and Tweedbank the NCN slips off the road and down a tiny dirt path next to the river, well-hidden by trees and bushes. We missed the sign and instead turned right across a newly-surfaced cycling and pedestrian bridge — which was fabulous infrastructure, even if it was the wrong direction (for us). Although NCN 1 follows the river most of the way to Newtown St Boswells, it’s not flat; we tackled about 1,000 feet of elevation gain including a good climb out of Melrose.
From Melrose we cycled on to Newtown St Boswells, where we had to leave the NCN and scout our own route south to Denholm. Navigation was a bit tricky since many of the minor roads were unsigned, but we wound our way through the countryside and arrived at the campsite around 6:30pm. We’d been lucky to get a booking in advance, since so many campsites are fully booked for weeks due to high demand. Ruberslaw is a well-run and pretty fancy campsite, with a central Hub with showers, phone charging and Wifi, and a shared open-air kitchen with a microwave and electric tea kettle! We’d opted to camp in one of their forest pitches, so after checking in we had to hike-a-bike up a grassy farm track to our spot in the woods.
Day 3 was a “rest” day. We were staying a second night at Ruberslaw but had to change sites since we hadn’t been able to book two nights in one spot. So we packed up camp and carried our gear with us 8 miles to Hawick (pronounced “Hoyk”) which was the closest town with a grocery store. As always seems to be the case, avoiding the main roads usually at least doubles the climbing, so it turned out to be a fairly strenuous “rest day” ride. In Hawick we had lunch outside at the Damascus Drum cafe and picked up some food to cook in camp before cycling 8 miles back (this time on a flatter route).
Day 4 brought 1,200 feet of elevation gain on foot, and another 1,600 feet on bikes. We spent the morning climbing Ruberslaw itself (“law” being a common word in Scotland for a hill, from the Anglo-Saxon word hlāw). The thunderstorms had finally broken overnight, so we left our wet tent to dry out a bit and hiked through the mist and purple heather up to the summit.
We left camp around 12pm and cycled on minor roads through Jedburgh up to Kelso. The rain caught up with us as we arrived in Kelso, notable for having a cobbled square with all cobbled roads leading into it —this is quite the experience on bikes (I call it the Cobble Wobble). All the cafes were closed and we were contemplating soggy takeaway sandwiches from Greggs until we happened to spot a nearby pub with a covered outdoor picnic table and made a dash for that just as the clouds burst open again. We tucked ourselves and our bikes under the awning and had an excellent lunch. (The name of the pub was, of course, The Cobbles — highly recommended).
We waited out the rain as long as we could then left Kelso looking for NCN Route 1 again (we missed the turn, but our alternate route on the back roads through Stichill and Leitholm was virtually traffic-free and mostly flat). The rain came down hard again for about 5 minutes, which was plenty of time to get us thoroughly drenched, even in our waterproof gear. Luckily we had 14 miles to dry out before we reached Swinton. We stayed overnight with some kind and covid-conscious Airbnb hosts who let us dry out our tent in their airing cupboard.
Notes on the route: after Jedburgh we turned north on the B6400 towards the tiny hamlet of Nisbet and then followed the Borders Abbeys Way for awhile. The section of the Borders Abbeys Way east from Nisbet is a rocky gravel track; for a paved road option go a bit further along the B6400 and take the next right.
Day 5, heading for the seaside! It was a short 17-mile ride from Swinton to Berwick-upon-Tweed in sunny weather. We cycled over the River Tweed and crossed the border from Scotland into England, then rejoined NCN 1 in Norham. We took a brief break in the shade and had a look round the Norham Castle ruins, then carried on, crossing over the 200-year-old Union Chain suspension bridge and following a separated cycle track briefly alongside the A1, then a bridleway over the hill into Berwick.
We set up camp at the Seaview Caravan Park on the outskirts of Berwick, and spent the rest of the sunny afternoon on the beach. (The Caravan Park was ok, not much accommodation for tents other than a small patch of lawn alongside the road, but lovely views and good facilities for toilets, showers, and washing-up sinks.)
Day 6, so long, sunshine. A thick fog rolled in overnight and beclouded the whole coast. We had a second night booked at the Caravan Park and had planned a day ride out and back to Lindisfarne National Nature Reserve and Holy Island, about 15 miles down the coast. Holy Island is connected to the mainland by a tidal causeway which is flooded by the sea twice a day, but the safe crossing window that day was between 12:10pm — 9:20pm so we had plenty of time. We followed NCN 1 all the way, which is a fantastic adventure over grassy clifftop paths (unpaved for most of the route). We were quite glad not to be hauling heavy panniers but met a few loaded touring cyclists who seemed to be having a great time. We intended to stop at the lone Londis shop near Beal for provisions, but instead came across the Barn at Beal Restaurant & Campsite so had coffee and very good sandwiches there instead.
Day 7 turned out to be our longest distance day, cycling 50 miles from Berwick-upon-Tweed to Yellowcraig Beach. We had takeaway breakfast rolls and coffee from the Mule on Rouge Cafe in Berwick, picked up some bread and cheese for lunch on the road, and cycled out on NCN 1, connecting to NCN 76 as we left town. NCN 76 was our route for most of the day; we left it briefly at Foulden to head inland and skipped the scenic loop to Eyemouth (saving those miles and hills for another day). We had lunch on the side of the road, picked wild blackberries, and rolled through the lovely town of Dunbar and then into North Berwick (not to be confused with Berwick-upon-Tweed).
Notes on the route: NCN 76 is mostly on-road, using quiet minor roads but with a 5-mile stretch on the A1107 from near Reston to Cocksburnpath. It’s a fast road but there weren’t many cars and drivers gave us plenty of space. After Bilsdean there’s a separated cycle way next to the A1 (crossing the A1 is required at one point, at a guided crossing) which takes you past Torness Nuclear Power Station. Not long after it’s a traffic-free path into Dunbar, and then it’s mostly on the John Muir Way (a mix of quiet roads, traffic-free paths, and grassy tracks) into North Berwick and on to Yellowcraig Beach.
After a short break in North Berwick we pedalled another 3 miles on to Yellowcraig Beach to wild camp for the night. There was a handful of other tents spaced out across the dunes when we arrived, and signs permitting responsible camping, so we waved hello to our distant camping neighbours, pitched our tent, and made macaroni cheese on the beach.
Day 8 was a straightforward journey from Yellowcraig Beach back home to Edinburgh, following a familiar route on the NCN 76. Glad to be back safely, and grateful for the dedicated folk at Sustrans who have built the fantastic National Cycle Network for everyone to travel along.
Total distance and elevation gain: 232 miles, 9,875 feet

During 2022 summer, I participated in a summer programme — student-led, individually-created course — in the University of Edinburgh. What this course about is students themselves design the course that they plan to study and use reflective framework to develop personal and professional skills throughout their learning process.
It is a good way to learn knowledge or skills outside of one’s major and with the guidance from the university, students are able to individually conduct reflective report regarding their study path — a meaningful assessment method on what students have learnt.
When I think about what I want to learn during the summer, a question popped out: what else can I create with the background of studying psychology?
It turns out that User Experience (UX) Design is an area connect tightly to psychology as it involves knowing users and solving their problems. Therefore, I decided to learn in more details how a UX designer conduct a project and what skills are required along the way.
The project that I choose to carry on is to solve a problem that I accidentally saw in the newspaper in which it talks about Nigeria’s stock market may need more than technology to thrive. Therefore, with the hope to have an accessible app for people with little investment knowledge to use, I decided to design an iOS app that can make users find it more easily to invest stocks online.
Project Showcase:
To have the prototypes like the picture showed above, I need to acquire several skills:
This programme requires two reflective reports to be submitted as a way of assessing students’ ability to self-trace what has been doing well and what can be improved.
To achieve a distinct grade, reports should show the writers’ reflection framework when reviewing their study processes. In particular, students’ critical reflection is important as it can shows that they are not only paying attention to what goes well but also taking into account areas that can be improved. For example, though I noticed that my learning process of using Figma is efficient in terms of time-management, the way I learn only relies on having my project done. If there is more self-exploration when learning to use Figma, my learning pathway can be more diverse.
Although in most of the time, this programme test people’s ability to self-study, each student is assigned to a tutor who will provide advice with how to improve their reflective ability.
Finally, I got an A with all the assessment being reviewed by my tutors. What this programme is about is not only the mark that I got, but truly teaches me the importance of learning process rather than the outcome.
Before enrolled in this programme, I rarely thought about what I want to do as my career. Although I am glad to being able to learn Psychology, there are so much choices that I can make to further my career.
With this programme experience, I decided to learn the UX design further and hope to being able to produce more projects that are useful for the real-world. Although I am lack of certain design skills, I believe this story told me that when one person decided to be the teacher and teach himself/herself, the power of learning is unbelievable.

on Edinburgh’s Royal Mile
St Giles High Kirkis celebrating its 900th birthday in style by getting some marvellous new lights installed. This really does cement its place on the Edinburgh skyline as the finest spire or sticky up bit (SOSUB) and I’d be prepared to roll up my sleeves and go bareknuckle with anyone who disagrees.
This long view shows the SOSUBS of (left to right) Edinburgh Castle, The Hub spire, then (in the background) the Scottish National War Memorial at the castle, St Giles crown spire, and The Tron Kirk spire.
You’re basically looking at a compressed Royal Mile squished into one frame with a 500mm lens.
The view from the street is pretty impressive too, especially when the haar rolls in from the North Sea and the beams of light continue into the sky. If only St Giles could work out a way to get £1 from everyone who takes a photo of the spire from the Royal Mile they could pay the leccy bill and a whole lot more.

I am, at heart, a homebody and perhaps that is why part of me is forever shocked I don’t live in my birth city. It’s especially dumbfounding given just how sensational Edinburgh, Scotland is as an abode: knock it out the park architecture everywhere the eye can see; it’s a manageable size (everything is basically ten minutes away from everything else); it is a place of international significance, historically (the birthplace of the Age of Enlightenment) and now (the city’s population doubles in size every August for its miscellany of festivals (International, Fringe, Book, Jazz)).
I left Edinburgh for the first time in 2000, aged seventeen to go to university (destination: Oxford) and returned in 2003, only to leave it again in 2012, aged twenty-eight (destination: London) hoping to leave behind my broken-heart and to kickstart my life as a blindsided singleton.
Plenty of people leave cities in those sorts of circumstances, but in the case of the 2012 departure, I do rather regret doing so, for it gave rise to a prolonged, complex grief from which I sometimes doubt I have yet fully recovered.
At the time, it felt like the whole city had been contaminated by a betrayal I had experienced at the hands of a boy I thought…

Edinburgh Festivals 2015 Impact Study
Quality of events and record numbers drive the world’s Festival City
Earlier this week, Festivals Edinburgh and BOP released the findings for the 2015 Festivals Edinburgh Impact Report. With the help of more than 30,000 survey respondents, our report quantifies the economic, social and cultural impact of the twelve Edinburgh Festivals represented by Festivals Edinburgh. The report confirms the significant contribution that Edinburgh Festivals make to the quality of life, international reputation and economic strength of Edinburgh and Scotland.
Key findings from our study show that:
The study takes a holistic approach to assessing impact that considers social, cultural and economic effects. This approach of assessing the ‘all-round’ value of the Festivals was ground breaking when BOP pioneered it for the 2010 Festivals Impact Study, and was the first study of its kind — not just for the twelve Edinburgh Festivals, but more widely in the Festivals and events sector.
This current study follows on from the methodology developed in 2010 and provides the first directly comparable data on the impacts of the Festivals at a five-year follow-up stage.
Read the full report, as well as the earlier 2010 report here.

I didn’t think that mice were good at climbing… until I rented a flat in Edinburgh!
If you’ve ever visited Edinburgh you’ll have noticed that much of the city is comprised of stone tenement flats. These ‘apartment blocks’ are usually 3 or 4 storeys high, often with a row of shops on the ground floor. Many date back to the 19th century, and most of them have rows and rows of chimneys on their terraced rooftops.
I’ve lived in several of these tenement flats, and visited many more. They are popular with students and young couples alike.
Being built of solid stone, with wood and plaster walls, there are gaps a-plenty. There are cracks around the skirting boards, in the backs of cupboards, around the old boarded up fireplaces (Edinburgh’s nickname of Auld Reekie comes from the smog emanating from the densely packed flats with a coal fire in each room!).
The tenements have been loved and lived-in by generations of Edinburghers. They provide a great place to live for people who enjoy the buzz of a capital city. They also provide the ideal place to live and bring up your family if you are a mouse!
3 of my flats were on the top floor. These were all on the third floor (fourth if you include ground floor). My flat in Marchmont had incredibly high ceilings, so I was a long way up! You can imagine my surprise when I first heard scratching noises behind a wall. I initially put it down to the students who lived next door.
The next sign that we had furry friends was when I repeatedly found myself cleaning up my flat-mate’s cornflakes on the kitchen worktop. How could he leave such a mess every day?! After a week of daily cleaning I picked up the cereal packet to wipe underneath, and a cascade of cornflakes tumbled from the box.
A mouse had eaten its way through the cardboard.
Soon after the kitchen incident I arrived home one afternoon to find myself face to face with a very well-fed brown and grey mouse, standing quite unperturbed in the middle of the living room floor!
Our eyes met, and for several seconds he sat up and stared right back at me. Without any fear, he then continued munching away on the biscuit crumbs he had found under the table, or down the side of the sofa.
I ran at him, not quite knowing what I would do if I caught him. The mouse nonchalantly ducked back through the tiny crack in the wall, just under the window, and was gone.
It was then that I decided the only way to deal with this was call out the pest control people. A friend had recommended a local mouse control company in Edinburgh so I gave them a call and they arrived the next day.
It was only then that I realised that Edinburgh tenements had the perfect network of tunnels, nooks and crannies which were ideal for mice to travel freely between floors, and build nests in the warm cavities behind those old walls.
The main thing I learned was to NOT LEAVE FOOD LYING OUT. I became an ardent fan of tupperware containers. In the end I didn’t have to kill any mice. I cleared up any traces of food, and blocked off the hole they were using to enter my flat. I presume the mice now visit the other kitchens in that block of flats — the ones that still have cornflakes lying out on the worktop.

I had wanted to post our travel journey chronologically but that just hasn’t happened, we’ve been too busy in some places and I’ve been just plain lazy in others. Perhaps I will write more about the other places our travels have taken us — Miami/New York (USA), Dominica (Caribbean), Havana (Cuba), Lisbon/Vilamoura/Carvoeira/Sintra (Portugal), Marbella/Malaga/Ronda (Spain), and Athens/Sifnos (Greece) and Dublin/Greystones (Ireland) — later. Chandler has been counting how many accomodations [AirBnB, hotels, TrustedHousesitters pet sits] we have stayed at since leaving Los Angeles 13 weeks and 5 days ago, and we are officially at # 26.
He started counting after seeing a couple of retired YouTube travel vloggers declare that they had stayed at 11 places in two months and they called their pace “insane”… he did the math and realized we “won”, yah and sigh.
We are now in Scotland. We started by exploring Edinburgh, which I loved, and then we went to the Scottish Highlands which I love even harder.
Edinburgh was stunning, it looks like every indie movie you have ever seen set in Scotland, cobblestone roads, castles built hundreds of years ago perched on rock formations formed thousands of years ago. But we kept reading things about “Edinburgh’s dark past” [truthfully they seem a little proud of it] so finally I googled it. Here are some of the juicy-awful results:
Edinburgh had some of the largest witch hunts in Europe with hideously sadistic torture methods, burning alive at the stake was one of the kinder methods and of course the bubonic plague in the 16th and 17th century.
“In 1456, a defensive wall was built around the Old Town. Problem was, no one wanted to live outside it, so as the population grew, people were packed together in increasingly unsanitary, greasy, moldy conditions. The only way to expand was upwards, so buildings got taller until they were up to 14 stories high, but had no toilets or running water. Residents would throw their waste out of their windows, shouting “gardyloo” as an advance warning, but it didn’t always work, and passers-by would get covered in poo.” [Source: Buzzfeed]
“Pestilence spread particularly rapidly in the tenement-filled, poverty-stricken, unhygenic conditions of the Royal Mile, and the council reacted with particularly brutal measures. When an outbreak hit the crowded Mary King’s Close, they ordered it to be bricked up, trapping over 300 infected and non-infected residents in their homes.” [Source: Buzzfeed]
But by the time we reached Edinburgh on June 4th, 2024 it was pretty damn civilized. We went to a little vegan options restaurant, had a couple of craft cocktails, and retired back to our AirBnB, certainly one of the prettiest I have been in, located in a historic building a block from the train station.
And as Taylor Swift was performing that weekend at Murrayfied Stadium, a herd [a gaggle, a flock, a swarm…a murder?] of Swifties descended upon Edinburgh. But as much as I hate crowds, they were so pink and sparkly and happy that it was hard to be annoyed at them. I almost joined them as ticket prices were “a bargain” compared to the U.S.A.; great seats could be had in Edinburgh for less than $500 as opposed to $2000 in L.A. and New York. But we didn’t, I fought my FOMO and won.
I thought I loved Scotland after seeing Edinburgh but man, it wasn’t until we got to the Highlands that I decided I really love it here. Despite the fact that it looks like every fantasy tale you’ve ever read as a child, with a demon possibly poised behind every moss-covered tree in the forest, that what is that sound-did I lock the door feeling I always had in the middle of the night in Los Angeles was gone. I felt safe. At last.
I really didn’t realize how the constant stress levels affected me both as a police officer in South Los Angeles and as a woman feeling vulnerable in her own home, but there was a palpable release when that feeling left me. It’s like a big warm hug and someone squeezing poison out of your system.
Crime is very low, air is clean, no natural disasters, and there are hardly any even predators, dogs are pretty much all floofs [and anyone who knows me knows I have loved and rescued bully breeds forever, but still, it is nice to walk a block without some ferocious sounding pack of dogs barking at you like my old neighborhood in Los Angeles], you are more likely to get hurt by a cow or a deer than anything else here. A cow or a deer.
How often could I take a walk in Los Angeles and not run into a single person, only hear the wind and the birds? In my entire life I can’t think of many places I can say that about. The beauty in Scotland is gob smacking, photos do not do it justice, epic mountains, rivers, forests and streams, Scotland has sights that are similarly as wondrous as Iceland without the swaths of humanity we encountered there.
Chela Landau’s youtube.com of a
Chandler saying goodbye to our Air BnB dog — Chela Landau’s youtube.com of
AirBnBs in Scotland bear no resemblance to any other place I’ve been. They ask you about your preferences, they stock the kitchen with vegan food, they meet you at the door and they often hug you when you leave.
At our AirBnB in Redcastle, Scotland the hostess showed us a “bothy” which we had access to during our stay with them, in U.S. terms it is like a man-cave shed, this one was small and cozy, had a wood burning stove and many candles. It was fabulous the one night we used it to read Harry Potter by candle light, intimate and romantic and exciting. Quite frankly though, the decapitated deer head staring at me with dead black eyes over the stove made me balk at going again back the next night as Chandler wanted.
But we were so content at our Redcastle AirBnB with it’s gorgeous garden and firth view, that we rarely ventured out except to get groceries at a market near us, which had a beautiful assortment of freshly grown fruit and vegetables.
After we got staples to eat the booze hunt was on, we found the local supermarket pretty well stocked [funny to see Jack Daniels in the foreign liquor section]. Looking for a local whisky for Chandler, I was corrected when I called it “Scotch”, they said that I should call it simply “Whisky” or risk insulting a Scotsman. (Yes, Scots remove the “e” in whiskey).
I have to say I’m a bourbon lass, I just can’t quite get behind that taste of moss in my drink, I will do better but for now it is tiny careful sips. I do love the stories however, I like the stories better than the actual whisky.
Any real whiskey drinker will know about “The Angel’s Share”; in medieval times when they would come to check on the barrels of whisky and they would have lost a third of the barrel’s contents to condensation, they believed that it was lost to the angels who had come down from heaven to sample their stock, and they figured in the loss as an offering that would make the angels smile upon them.
One of my favorite bourbon whiskeys is an American bourbon named Angels Envy in a sly wink to the folklore [athough in a bar we saw the sign “We have Whisky and Bourbon”, as though bourbon was a child of a lesser god and not worthy to be called whisky.
Anyhow, enough for today, we are going to Isle of Skye next and then Inverness to take a plane to Amsterdam, where we plan on settling in the Netherlands to begin our new lives; actually our new lives have begun, and every day is cherished.

I headed out at 10 but not before requesting a bottom bunk for tonight. Last night was hell! It goes without saying that I had to use the loo at least half a dozen times last night. Sometimes I don’t need to go at all or more usually, just once! I’m strong but not invincible. I was singing this song as I descended the spiral staircase. I was going to have a good day if it killed me.
My plan B was to buy some disposable adult nappies. Don’t laugh. They are the best invention since Scottish toasties which is what I’m having for breakfast right now. Filled with haggis, caramelised onion chutney and matured cheddar cheese. In the spirit of full disclosure, I did go to the Snax Cafe first, hoping for a full Scottish breakfast but I couldn’t get through the door — no I’m not that fat! — it was filled with people all waiting for food. It’s smoko time for the construction workers in the area. So I’m in the Snax Bakehouse next door where I’m enjoying a window seat and my coffee and Scottish toastie.

There are two things that strike me every time I walk the streets of Edinburgh.
The first is that nearly everyone is carrying tote bags full of groceries. So many flats in the city don’t have storage space, so grocery shopping is a daily errand.
The second is the incredibly disciplined behaviour of the dozens of dogs being walked by their owners that pass by me every day.
Their behaviour is invariably impeccable, regardless of age or breed.
They walk at their master’s side, many on leash, some not, keeping step, and seldom varying their focus from looking straight ahead. They don’t seem to take note of anyone or anything they pass by, including fellow canines. They don’t stop to exchange sniffs or even to sniff any of the myriad enticements at their level. Never has a passing pooch glanced up at me, hoping for a pat. One dog I noticed that did let its attention drift to the undergrowth of a shrub moved hastily along when its owner said: “Come along, love.”

*** Originally published (in slightly edited form) on http://brightsurroundings.wordpress.com, February 25, 2019 ***
Edinburgh’s music scene has always been, to an extent, fairly eclectic. Trad-folk pubs stand adjacent to metal bars, and indie kids nod their heads to glitzy guitar pop before hard techno nights on the Cowgate every weekend. While this diversity is self-evident, it’s impossible to ignore the fact that within each genre or sub-scene, artists tend to adhere to certain ideas of musical safety or appropriateness at their respective venues. I am by no means questioning the validity or talent of any of these bands — there are a huge host of genuinely fantastic acts who fall into this description that I actively support — but I would like to direct attention towards some of the city’s more obscure and boundary-pushing music which tends to be ignored by the scene as a whole.
By writing this article, I hope to present a primer for anyone interested in discovering more about Edinburgh’s incredible outsider and experimental musicians who are stretching genre limitations and forging their own paths within the city’s scene. This is not necessarily a definitive list; there is likely a myriad of under-the-radar performers who have escaped my attention so far, but I would like to stress that — as far as I’m aware — this group remains on the fringes of the scene. Consider my thoughts, listen to the music, go to see the acts play live — supporting these people will not only benefit the individuals, but will also foster support and encouragement for artistic experimentation in general. Dig in!
Oharasix: https://oharasix.bandcamp.com/
The experimental and the electronic always go hand-in-hand, as both tendencies tend to strive for sonic and technological innovation. Josh Corkill’s output under the ‘Oharasix’ moniker perfectly embodies this approach: digitally manipulated samples and loops combine to create an unsettling landscape of warped club tracks, dominated by rhythmic glitches and pumping techno-inspired kicks. This stuff is an audiophile’s dream, as Corkill’s manic production is jittery, maximalist and wholly unique. The two live releases available on the Oharasix bandcamp page are the best examples of his skill, as both performances are rife with repetitive, glassy synth stabs which fly around and punctuate the underlying beats of every piece. Having witnessed Josh perform at Sketchy Beats last year, I can fully recommend catching him live whenever you get the chance — using just Ableton and a modest MIDI controller, he has a prodigious ability to sculpt industrial noise into a seamless and infectiously dance-able mix.
Smiling Suns:
https://soundcloud.com/smilingsuns
Serving as the aural antidote to the noise of Oharasix, Smiling Suns is an ambient project centred around organic instrumentation and minimal arrangements. The anonymous musician’s SoundCloud page is home to some truly compelling compositions where art music, post-rock and folk collide. Appropriately titled, 2017’s Quiet Songs II is a collection of tranquil musical sketches, constructed sparsely on acoustic piano, accordion, and slide guitar. Smiling Suns’ bio lists both Stars of the Lid and Godspeed You! Black Emperor as influences, and it is easy to observe their mark on the affective melodies of ‘Rhema’ and ‘Baby Steps,’ but an immediate sense of individuality underpins the form of every track. ‘Duror’ features a stunning chorus of reverberating classical guitars which float over a droning accordion, and the lo-fi warmth of ‘Falling’ is mesmerising. This really is one of the hidden gems of the Edinburgh scene (and with such expert concealment of identity, Smiling Suns may well remain hidden) — I’ll be keeping an eager ear to the ground for new material in the future.
Aamber Glass:
https://northtsar.bandcamp.com/album/a-new-year-dithered-dreamer-doused-in-rays-of-sun-cutting-through-the-skyline-of-east-finchley
To continue with the theme of anonymous ambient artists, Aamber Glass is an equally elusive creator of intriguing and understated soundscapes. Only one release has been issued under the mysterious handle — 2018’s evocative ‘a new year’ / ‘dithered dreamer doused in rays of sun cutting through the skyline of east finchley.’ This limited edition cassette consists of two separate “bodies of work.” The first is a series of individual compositions, in which ethereal synth loops are accompanied by echo-drenched field recordings. A personal highlight is the track ‘susanna,’ where a chopped-up, tremolo-laden chord trembles above ghostly background noise and continuously overlapping synth melodies. On the second side of the tape, Aamber Glass builds a mammoth 20-minute wall of modulating drones. We are guided through turns melancholic and tumultuous towards a slowly-fading finale. It is a grandiose, meditative effort which is unabashedly experimental. I genuinely mean it when I say that art of this scope and dedication sets the bar high for any prospective avant-garde composers.
Harry Bongo: https://harrybongo.bandcamp.com/
Perhaps one of the best-known faces on the city’s scene is Mr. Harry Bongo: drummer for numerous noisy instrumental acts, contemporary classical composer and beloved cheese DJ, Bongo is Edinburgh’s diversity personified. Particularly arresting is his solo output, which sees Harry take complete creative control as he crafts an array of beautiful minimalist works. I use the tag ‘minimalist’ tag here with reference to the art music movement rather than production — while such comparisons are reductive, echoes of Reich, Glass and Riley are everywhere on his releases, as repeating mallet sequences evolve into rich climaxes of strings, guitars and percussion. Harry’s self-titled 2016 album displays the breadth of his oeuvre: centrepiece ‘Vessels’ begins with a pulsating groove (which isn’t too far removed from Reich’s Music for 18 Musicians ), and this quickly morphs into an intense, cinematic swirl of computerised arpeggios and throbbing drums. Pieces such as ‘Prague’ and ‘Ashes’ are more restrained, with layers of lush strings and field recordings creating a warm sense of space. After an almost two-year break, Harry released ‘Three in Four’ in late 2018, a hectic single which twists and turns, weaving samples of Björk talking about her TV over frantic drum loops, distorted pianos and wild, echoing synth bleeps. Without giving too much away, I can recommend keeping an eye out for an imminent release — Bongo is back (and in good form, too).
Joe Coghill:
https://soundcloud.com/joecoghill
According to a short biography on the Glasgow International website, Joe Coghill is “a multi-disciplinary artist, musician and experimental publisher,” and so he neatly represents a kind of avant-garde mindset that is crucial to a revitalisation of the scene. “His practice,” it goes on to explain incorporates “video, performance, social sculpture, facilitation and media distribution” (one example of this is his curation of an exhibition at Edinburgh’s Fruitmarket Gallery inspired by no-wave composer John Margotti.) While it’s obvious that Coghill’s work isn’t limited to audio, the small amount of his works available online are incredible displays of experimental electronics. Fans of IDM bastions Aphex Twin and Squarepusher will be particularly at home with the material on his SoundCloud page, which closely resembles one of RDJ’s famed audio dumps: the mammoth collection of twisted samples and glitchy, granular atmospheres features esoteric track titles such as ‘bv,mt Eye’ and ‘Ae_frag.aef2dream’ (a cheeky nod to Autechre, perhaps?) Despite the obvious influences of these pieces, Coghill’s approach is far from derivative. His paranoid sequences and ceaseless folds of noise are refreshingly imaginative, and provide a welcome break from the monotonous tech-house of Edinburgh’s clubs. Dive in!
Mixed Signals: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj_Jrf-g6BPebK7CXKjDLBg
…And now for something completely different. Live double bass and laptop electronics form the crux of Mixed Signals’ sound, providing a base for a tapestry of sinister drones, eerie vocal snippets and chopped-up field recordings. Long-form, slow-burning pieces are the specialty of these local experimenters, who have concocted a special brand of “mesmerising doom.” As the ensemble tend to operate as a live unit, they don’t currently have a lot of material online — however, their Youtube channel is home to two intriguing examples of their work. ‘The Door to Desolation’ is a 16-minute jam recorded live at the Black Medicine Basement, and ‘Taster Sounds’ is “not polished, not prepared, just a bit of an improvised draft of a taster of a teaser.” Although both of these are presented as spontaneous compositions, they are impressive statements of unique musicianship and an unorthodox approach. Both videos display the band’s love of serpentine beats and menacing synth pads punctuated by swathes of maverick double bass. In addition to the striking music, the videos themselves are incredible — clips which seem to be pulled straight from Norwegian “slow TV” are juxtaposed with unsettling, handwritten phrases and abstract sprays of light. This fits in with the tendency of local avant-garde creators to foray into the world of multimedia, and adds an interesting audio-visual edge to the group’s vision. Keep an eye out for Mixed Signals on the local circuit, as their live show is one of the scene’s most immersive experiences.
Liam Baker:

Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T6r5QiBtww&feature=youtu.be
On the subject of multimedia, Liam Baker is a prolific creator of harrowing music, stunning poetry and exploratory film projects. At first glance, Liam’s music isn’t perhaps as out-there as some of the others on this list, but both his subject matter and his approach to creation are more than deserving of the “experimental” tag; consider the self-made video for ‘Consumatum Est (It Is Over),’ in which Liam sings a funereal melody and accompanies himself on classical guitar from the comfort of his own bathtub. His dynamic live performances consist of spoken word and solemn acoustic ballads, which marry such gloomy subjects as death, drug use and gentrification with a healthy dose of black humour. I once had the pleasure of watching Liam perform to a room full of avid punks and metalheads, and you could literally hear a pin drop from start to end; the remarkably attentive silence was testimony to Liam’s enigmatic stage presence and the powerful delivery of his lines. As with Joe Coghill and Mixed Signals, Liam’s music makes up a small fraction of his overall creative output: he’s one of a select group of all-round creatives who are fully stretching their limits and showcasing the possibilities of being an “artist” on Edinburgh’s underground circuit.

I visited National Museums Scotland (NMS) and Scottish National Gallery (SNG)in Edinburgh and experienced some stunning pieces. Below I have shown and written about a few of the designs I took a liking too from NMS however I couldn’t share any of my favourite pieces from SNG as no photography was allowed due to the possibility of people creating forgeries.
This exact skeleton of the giant deer is the first ever complete version. This was given over to the university of Edinburgh as, at the time (1921), it was one of the world’s best natural history collections. It was then given over to the National Museums Scotland and remains there still. These skeletons are important as they help with discovering what animals have become extinct in the past. What I find most interesting is how fresh and recent this skeleton looks due to how well its been preserved but it is in fact 12,300 years old. I find skeletons like this very interesting as you get to see every tiny (and giant) bone put in the body and see how different and delicately designed every body is. It’s not everyday you have that opportunity. Lastly, I like the placement of this piece as it’s right at the entrance to all the animals exhibits and I feel it’s successful in catching your eye and dragging you towards that area of the museum.
This piece is about our path throughout life. In this you can see the figures in the circles are symbolic for perishing, rebirth and transforming. The golden thread wrapped around the figures is meant to show its leading the way out of this maze, symbolizing their life line. I enjoy this piece through the depth and reality of the meaning Kinnaird brought to it; it really made me reflect on my own life and how fragile it really is. Moreover, the colours are very vibrant and I feel that the prominent red colour suggests blood and health whereas the blues and purples suggest an ambition (possibly to escape the maze?) and peace.
This design is a printed textile piece which was created for Liberty & Co and Hull Traders. The material used was screen-printed woven cotton satin. The main colours used in this piece are pinks, reds and oranges which suggests a warm atmosphere. I think that McNish may have used these colours to match title of “Painted Desert” as when you think of a desert you typically think of an isolated, sandy area where there is a blistering heat. I like the abstract vibe and colour scheme to this piece of design as I feel they are in harmony with each other due to their wild, creative style.
Artist, Eduardo Paolozzi, played around with geometric shapes and designs for this piece with a variety of colours and shades. This particular piece was the first ever designed for Wedgwood. The materials consist of screen-printed porcelain. I am intrigued by Paolozzi’s use of shapes and the intricate detail put into each small section of the plates. Personally, I am a big fan of geometric work and believe that Paolozzi done a fantastic job at presenting his style here. The colours used throughout are mostly warm colours and shades with a few cold colours in contrast which I feel just adds to how eye catching they are.

First, let me get this out of the way:
If you’re a theater fan who is interested in new works, you should go to the Fringe.
If you’re a theatermaker, who is interested in making new works, whether you’re a writer, producer, director, actor or anything . . . you must go to the Fringe.
For me, it was an inspirational experience.
To see the thousands of theatermakers creating new work, on small stages, in the most challenging circumstances, for little or no money . . . yet with such unbridled joy . . . was a reminder of why we all do what we do.
Broadway has been a challenge these past four years. And it’s not getting any easier. Since the pandemic, we’ve all questioned why we do it. We all questioned if we should do something else. We all developed a little bitterness as costs escalated, audiences haven’t returned in full . . . and making and marketing the work got harder.
For me? Being at the Fringe washed away that caked-on cynicism in one day. It was like going to a theater spa. I’m refreshed, renewed, and ready to double down on my commitment to making theater.
On top of THAT, I learned a Fringe-ton of stuff . . . about making theater, making theater at festivals, marketing theater, marketing theater at…

Hi there! It’s good to see you here.
This photo is exactly where I am now — an uphill climb to see as much of the world as possible. Yet, some places capture me instantly when I arrive. Edinburgh, the city and its people, is one of those. While I write short posts with photos, this one is a longer read with even more pictures and will be in several parts.
My daughter and I decided to visit Scotland. I knew I needed a month, but because of our schedules, I only had a week. At first, our plans involved a rental car and too many stops until I realized I only wanted to see Edinburgh on this first trip. Thanks to my daughter, we enjoyed our trip, and I hope to return to a different location in Scotland at least every other year.
The city exceeded my expectations. Why? I felt immediately at home. If you’ve read my other posts, you know that a city’s vibes either make it for me or not. I have no idea why I feel the energy in things, people, and places, but I do. Edinburgh, for me, is calm and reassuring. Not so in London (as I will discuss in a later post), where we’d just left. There, I feel discombobulated. My brain hears English being spoken but doesn’t feel at home. I anticipated the same thing in Scotland, but thankfully, it didn’t happen.
We took the train from London into Edinburgh Waverley, in the city’s heart. The station is magnificent. After looking at the bus routes and getting tips from our apartment host, we decided to walk to our apartment. I’m glad we did. Here are some scenes along the way.
Our Airbnb in Marchmont near The Meadows had a lot of light, even on a somewhat gloomy day like the one above. Our flat had two bedrooms and two baths, with windows in both bedrooms, a necessity for us both. We had a pleasant morning visitor every day who watched us eat breakfast. The apartment was stocked with things to eat related to Scotland, which was a nice touch.
Our hosts at the apartment we rented in Marchmont were fabulous. They provided transportation tips and suggestions for food, even meeting with us to have a beer and a chat and answer all my questions. (I cannot get Scottish citizenship because of UK rules. They don’t like older adults, it seems.)
The Meadows is a large park near the University of Edinburgh. The paths through the garden were the easiest way to reach most of the places we decided to see daily. Edinburgh has a decent bus service, but we used our feet to take it slow and see the city center on this first trip.
We were in the city the week after Fringe, the year of a garbage workers’ strike, and our Airbnb hosts were apologetic about the city’s look. Having frequented New York City, I was surprised at how clean this city was, even amid a garbage strike. All the people, whether tourists or residents, kept the garbage in the taped-off areas with signage, and the rest of the city was kept clean.
Our landlord insisted we could not visit Edinburgh without a trip to Holyrood Park and a hike up to Arthur’s Seat. Up to the challenge (well, my daughter more than me), we set out for the hike up the hill the next day. It was worth it for the scenery alone.
If you’ve never been to Edinburgh, the main downtown area with tourist attractions is easy to wander. We began at the Palace of Holyroodhouse and walked up the Royal Mile to Edinburgh Castle, stopping in shops after lunch in a small cafe, then visiting one of the cathedrals.
Even with the level of tourists at the end of the Fringe, it was a pleasant walk without the usual hassle of packed streets and impatient tourists.
Here are more photos; I’ll have more in the next post.

Scotland’s capital is one classy city. Edinburgh boasts quaint cobbled streets, many hidden hide-outs, excellent shopping, eerie dungeons and a big boss of a castle that rivals even Hogwarts. No wonder it’s famous for putting on a heck of a festival every year. Even better than that, it lasts the whole month of August, and jam-packs in so many diverse acts that the festival programme is published as thick as the phone book. The Edinburgh International Festival is the world’s largest arts festival and it’s no surprise that it attracts acts and tourists from every continent, as well as the locals, in droves. This is a city which takes great pride in its culture, where the best of the best hope to make a name during the festivities.
So don your finest kilt if you have one, embrace (don’t slate) the sounds of bagpipes, and drink Tennents until you are fully wearing your beer goggles. It’s going be one heck of a month.

I’m writing this as I realize how these memories are ones I never want to forget
In 2022, during my study exchange in the UK, I finally had the chance to explore one of my dream destinations: Edinburgh. Even though it was a short trip — just two days — visiting Edinburgh was a dream come true. I don’t know when my fascination with Edinburgh began, but I’ve always been drawn to its charm. I would often find myself lost in Pinterest searches, captivated by images of its small alleys, the rain-soaked streets, the gloomy and moody weather, and the warm tones of autumn. Without any clear reason, I’ve always felt like I belonged there.
Naturally, when my friends and I were planning our reading week itinerary — a break that happens before exam week — we decided to include Edinburgh. It was a spontaneous choice but one that made perfect sense. So, where do I begin?
We set off from Windermere (District Lake), bound for Edinburgh Waverley Station. By the time we arrived at the station, it was already quite late. We took a city bus to the nearest stop to our accommodation — the West End Hotel. However, we still had to walk at least fifteen minutes to get to the hostel. Tired as we were, the walk through the cool, dimly lit streets of Edinburgh was exhilarating. The city felt alive, even at that hour, with its historic buildings and the crisp autumn air. As I stepped off the bus and set foot on Edinburgh’s cobblestone streets for the first time, I let out a deep breath. Finally, I thought, I’m here.
It was 23:56 GMT on the 1st of November, 2022 — a special time when the time returned to GMT, just as BST had gracefully ended with the last Sunday of October.
When we got to our hostel, we were expecting a spacious room. We had booked a room with two bunk beds, and the pictures from Airbnb made it look roomy enough. However, as it turned out, the room was — it was cozy but — far from spacious, it was so damn narrow! Let me explain: there was just one small (literally small idk the size but it really small I bet you) room with two bunk beds, each with three levels, which meant six beds in total. There was only one bathroom for six of us to share. Imagine, there were five of us plus one stranger — a man who was already half-asleep when we arrived. But despite all that, the hostel was pretty clean.
With our suitcases and tired bodies, we made quite a racket as we tried to figure out who would shower first, given that we all felt too damn stinky after our journey. I’m pretty sure our new roommate woke up, even if he pretended to sleep through our commotion. Sorry, bro, didn’t mean to be so noisy — we’re just tourists, after all.
The morning of November 2nd greeted my birthday with its own special charm — a veil of gloom and a soft, persistent drizzle. The sky was overcast, casting a muted, gray light over the city. It was the kind of weather that could make a city feel both cozy and melancholic. Despite the drizzle, we were determined not to let it dampen our spirits or waste any precious moments of our time here, so off we went.
Our first stop was Tesco, a short ten-minute walk away to pick up breakfast and I chose a cheese sandwich and a bottle of mineral water. The simple act of grabbing food felt like a small victory against the gray weather, fueling us for the day ahead.
With our breakfast in hand, we headed to our first destination: Dean Village. The village’s enchanting streets and picturesque landscapes offered a warm contrast to the dreary weather. We meandered through its cobbled paths and admired the historic charm of the old buildings, their facades softened by the rain. For about 40 minutes, we explored every nook and cranny, each corner revealing a new facet of the village’s beauty.
During our exploration, I took a moment to video-call my sister, she was studying at the library and ran outside when she heard I was in Edinburgh. She showed her excitement and called to wish me a happy birthday.
After a few photos and a chat with my sister, we continued our journey through Edinburgh. With no tight schedule or set itinerary, we allowed ourselves to drift through the city center, embracing the spontaneous rhythm of our exploration. The drizzle continued, creating a soothing backdrop to our wanderings.
The wind, however, proved to be a formidable challenge. It was so strong that when we tried to use our umbrella, it turned inside out in a comical twist of fate. We laughed at the absurdity of it all, the umbrella flapping helplessly against the gusts. Despite the weather’s attempts to thwart us, the experience was exhilarating and added a memorable touch to our day.
As we strolled through the city’s streets, we ended up at Ross Fountain. Ross Fountain evokes a sense of elegance and charm. The fountain’s ornate details and vibrant colors make it a striking focal point against the backdrop of Edinburgh’s historic architecture. Our each step was accompanied by the gentle sound of rain and the occasional burst of wind. The day’s weather, though dreary, felt like an integral part of the city’s atmosphere, enhancing the adventure rather than hindering it. It was a perfect start to my birthday in Edinburgh.
Without realizing it, noon had arrived. We decided to seek warmth from the chilly drizzle and stop at a Thai halal restaurant. The cozy atmosphere was a welcome refuge from the damp weather, and the warmth of the restaurant felt like a comforting embrace.
The restaurant, with its inviting ambiance and delicious food, provided a perfect break from our explorations. We enjoyed a hearty lunch, savoring the flavors, sharing stories and laughter. Unbeknownst to me, my friends had ordered a dessert and marked it as a birthday cake. It was a simple gesture that added a touch of magic to my already-sweet birthday. The dessert, with its rich and sweet taste, felt like a cherry on top of an already memorable day.
After lunch, we set off to explore another part of Edinburgh. Our next stop was Victoria Street, a vibrant and picturesque area known for its colorful buildings and charming shops. One of the shops we wandered into was a Harry Potter-themed store, where we soaked in the magical atmosphere and picked up a few souvenirs. We also took some photos of the rainbow arching across the city, adding a splash of color to the gray day.
As we explored, we lost track of time and soon noticed the sun began to set. The weather took a turn for the worse, with heavy rain and strong winds making it uncomfortable to be outside. We decided to take shelter in a nearby Mexican restaurant. Inside, it was just the three of us and the waitress. She gave us a complimentary cup of tea as a thank you for helping her get in the chairs and tables that got wet outside.
Meanwhile, our other two friends had different plans and had set off for Birmingham. As we waited for the rain to pass, we enjoyed burritos and relaxed in the warmth of the restaurant. The meal and the shelter provided a pleasant pause in our day, allowing us to regroup and watch as the day turned to dark. Then we decided to head back to the hostel. We were freezing and tired but ended up waiting about an hour for a city bus, and it took another hour to get back to the hostel.
Day two in Edinburgh began quite differently from the first. It was November 3rd, 2022, and the morning was bright and windy, the opposite of the previous day’s gloomy drizzle. It was also our last day in the city, so my friends and I decided to take it easy and enjoy a leisurely morning stroll in search of coffee.
We found a charming little café, Patisserie Florentin, near Circus Lane, about a 20-minute walk from the West End Hostel. I ordered a hazelnut latte and a cookie, a perfect start to the day. The warm coffee and sweet treat felt comforting, especially with the crisp morning air around us. After got fueled, we wandered around Circus Lane, snapping photos of the picturesque alley with its beautiful scenery. The small, charming street was filled with quaint houses and vibrant plants, making it a perfect spot for capturing memories.
Not too long, we headed to the Royal Botanic Garden to enjoy the fresh air and greenery. We spent about an hour strolling through the gardens, taking in the peaceful atmosphere. The morning was quiet, with a gentle breeze blowing through the trees, the sun was shining, making everything look vibrant and full of life. Not to forget, I bought a unique souvenir from the garden’s shop — a glass aromatherapy bottle featuring a gold tree design on a white background. It was a beautiful reminder of our time in Edinburgh, a keepsake that captured the serenity and beauty of the Royal Botanic Garden.
Feeling satisfied after wandering around the vast, peaceful garden, we made our way to the heart of Edinburgh — Princes Street. We returned to take in the sight of the iconic Scott Monument, a towering Gothic structure that never failed to impress. I found it to be the perfect spot for people-watching.
As we meandered, I could hear the beautiful instrumental music played by a street artist, adding a melodic backdrop to the lively scene. People strolled by, chatting and laughing with friends, their voices blending with the music. I noticed an elderly man sitting on a bench, engrossed in his newspaper, while others sat nearby, absorbed in their books. Some people rushed by, possibly late for work or trying to catch a bus, their hurried footsteps echoing on the pavement. There were also fellow tourists like us, with bright, curious expressions, taking in the sights and sounds of the city.
The streets were busy, full of life and energy. It was a perfect blend of the everyday hustle and the charm of a city rich in history and culture. Standing there, surrounded by the vibrancy of Edinburgh, I felt a sense of connection to the city and its people.
As we strolled down Leith Street, we stumbled upon Maki & Ramen. The sight of the steaming bowls of ramen was too tempting to resist, so we went in. The ramen was delicious — warm, flavorful, and exactly what we needed. And don’t worry, if you’re vegan or need a gluten-free option, you just need to inform the friendly staff about your dietary requirements. And for Muslim visitors, they offer Halal-certified chicken and beef dishes. As their slogan goes, “Vegan? Halal? Gluten-free? No problem. At Maki & Ramen, inclusivity is key.”
After enjoying our meal, we realized we didn’t have any set plans for the rest of the day. So, on a whim, we decided to head to Calton Hill. It only took us about four minutes to reach the entrance from Regent Road, where we began our hike. Yes, hike… but I think it’s worth it as Calton Hill is known for being one of the best places to visit in Edinburgh, and you know… it’s free.
The hike wasn’t too strenuous. Just four flights of stone steps and an uphill walk, making it a pleasant and manageable climb. It was a good bit of exercise, and we were rewarded with spectacular views of Edinburgh. From the top of Calton Hill, we could capture some of the most iconic photos of the city, including the breathtaking view of the Old Town. The panoramic scenery was worth every step, offering a perfect blend of Edinburgh’s historic and natural beauty.
There were so many things to explore at Calton Hill. As we walked around, we admired the impressive Playfair Monument and the towering Nelson Monument, which provides a stunning 360-degree view of Edinburgh if you climb to the top. We also visited the Collective Gallery, a center for contemporary art that showcases modern works in a historic setting. One of the most iconic sights was the Dugald Stewart Monument, a beautiful structure that stands out against the skyline, offering a perfect spot for taking photos.
Calton Hill isn’t just a place for great views; it’s rich in history too. The hill has been a significant site in Edinburgh for centuries, with its origins as a place of gathering dating back to the 16th century. It became a public park in 1724, making it one of the oldest public parks in Scotland. The various monuments on the hill, like the National Monument, are built to commemorate significant historical figures and events. For instance, the Nelson Monument was built to honor Admiral Horatio Nelson’s victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. The hill has long been a symbol of Scottish Enlightenment, representing both historical remembrance and cultural progress.
Exploring Calton Hill gave us a deeper appreciation of Edinburgh’s rich history and culture. We spent hours wandering around, taking in the sights and enjoying the peaceful atmosphere. It was a perfect way to wrap up our visit to Edinburgh, combining breathtaking views with a sense of connection to the city’s past.
Before we knew it, time gently nudged us to leave, pulling us from the embrace of this enchanting city. With a mix of reluctance and contentment, we made our way to the intercity bus bound for Glasgow, and from Buchanan Station, we set off back to London. As the bus moved away from Edinburgh, I took one last look at the city that had given me so much in such a short time.
These past two days were a vivid collection of memories — unexpected moments, stunning vistas, and cherished times with friends. Having my birthday here, in the city I had long dreamed of, turned a simple trip into a profound experience. I am deeply grateful for every second, every shared smile, and every view that left me breathless. This was a birthday to remember, and Edinburgh, with its rain-kissed streets and storied hills, will forever hold a piece of my soul.

Heading into Edinburgh on the tram, I couldn’t help but feel that I had missed the memo that the Fringe had a dress code and that it was hiking gear.
Everyone around me was wearing a backpack over a waterproof coat and hiking trousers or jeans. The weather forecast had predicted rain, but I felt more like I was heading into the mountains than the centre of a major city from the attire of the crowd. I stood out rather a lot with my skirt and handbag.
I had little experience of arts festivals, but I had expected there might be some more interesting clothing choices. I would have to wait until I reached the Royal Mile to find the more experimental outfits.
Disembarking on Princes Street, my companion and I decided to stroll around Princes Street Gardens before heading up to the Royal Mile. This park offers possibly the best view of the castle and how the rock on which it sits rises steeply up from the comparatively flat gardens below.
It’s well worth a detour to see the memorial to Wojtek the Bear who served in the Polish army during World War II. No, I’m not joking. After the war, Wojtek accompanied his comrades to Scotland. They feared a return to Poland would see him used as propaganda by communist authorities, so he lived out his days in Edinburgh Zoo, where he died in 1963. The memorial depicts him with his caretaker Peter Prendys and features scenes from his life.
We then followed the stream of people heading up the steep street (rather appropriately named The Mound) to reach the Royal Mile, the historic street which runs from the Scottish Parliament Building up to Edinburgh Castle. The railing separating the Gardens from the street was covered in posters advertising acts performing at the Fringe. The sheer number of shows was quite impressive — how could the city have enough venues for all these acts to perform daily, I wondered.
One poster in particular caught our attention: the title “Swamplesque: the burlesque parody — uncover all the layers” printed above an image of a woman painted green and dressed like Shrek. I can’t vouch for the quality of the show, but it certainly did a good job at standing out from the crowd of other adverts.
Once we had completed the climb, we were greeted by a group of young people in blue jumpsuits who were stood on traffic bollards and giving a rather lacklustre performance of Uptown Funk. Although this was amusing at first, once we returned to the area a bit later in the day and found they were still singing only this one song on repeat, I started to wonder if they were driving business away from the cafés and tourist shops nearby. The singers weren’t bad, but their trombone player’s performance left a lot to be desired. And who wants to hear Bruno Mars all day anyway?
We crossed the Royal Mile and headed downhill again along George IV Bridge to visit one of the city’s essential tourist stops: The Elephant House. The café opened in 1995 and soon became famous as the location where J. K. Rowling wrote the early Harry Potter books. The business has really capitalised on its link to the author (and who can blame it?), styling itself the “birthplace” of Harry Potter and catering to the tourists who flock to Edinburgh for the city’s somewhat loose connection to the series — although Rowling lived and wrote here, the novels do not take place in the city.
This hasn’t stopped a whole industry giving Harry Potter tours and selling Harry Potter merchandise from developing in the city. I’ve observed the same phenomenon in Cambridge, a city which has even less to do with Harry Potter. This technicality doesn’t seem to prevent tourists enthusiastically spending their money on fake wands and Hedwig keyrings. It’s rather telling that there are Chinese and Spanish versions of the café’s website, as this is hardly the norm in the UK.
Sadly, the café was recently damaged in a fire. But, for now, tourists can visit its second location, which is just around the corner on Victoria Street, a picturesque lane lined by brightly coloured shop fronts. When we arrived, The Elephant House had a rather conspicuous crowd around the entrance, making it hard to miss.
Popping in to have a look at the new location, we were greeted by Harry Potter merch and a takeaway menu that had certainly changed since Rowling frequented the café in the 90s.
Patrons have to head upstairs to reach the café proper. Despite it not yet being 30 minutes since the café opened, there was already a queue. The patrons didn’t seem to care that this wasn’t really where Rowling wrote Harry Potter as they passed the time posing for photos.
We decided to find somewhere without a queue and headed back up to the Royal Mile to Deacon’s House Café. This historic café was almost unchanged from when we had visited several years ago, only much busier with the Fringe crowd.
The ground floor of the café was once the workshop of Deacon Brodie, an 18th-century gentleman by day and head of a gang of burglars by night. Brodie’s double life supposedly inspired Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.
The wall of the café is decorated by a mural which depicts scenes from the novella alongside significant episodes in Scottish history while the courtyard offers a quiet spot just off the bustling Royal Mile for a cup of tea and a cake in classic British fashion.
It was while walking down the Royal Mile that I finally saw the eccentric outfits I had been expecting. The streets around St Giles’ Cathedral were packed, tourists stopping to watch an eclectic range of performers.
While gazing up at the impressive St Giles’ Cathedral, I heard someone behind me say, “it’s like Midsommar.” Turning around, I saw what he meant: a group of young women in long white dresses and flower crowns were flailing in slow motion in the centre of the street. One was even sat on the ground and caressing the cobblestones.
The usual street performers were also out in force. As we stopped to look at a living statue painted in silver, we could hear a shout of “this next one is Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls” from a busker around the corner. Looking up at the church, I wondered whether the street had been this chaotic in the days when the Scottish Reformer John Knox preached there.
We found our path blocked by a crowd so large that I had to stand on my toes and strain my neck to see what they were watching, since all I could see was the top half of a man wobbling from side to side. It turned out he was balancing on a ladder, wearing a kilt and holding juggling clubs in one hand. It seemed we had arrived just as he had paused his act to address the crowd.
After asking how many of the crowd weren’t from the UK and receiving a lukewarm cheer in response, he went on to lecture us all on how much he loved immigration and how bad fascism is. I imagine anyone who had just wanted a nice day out to forget about about the depressing state of modern Britain would have been sadly disappointed by this reminder of the tense political situation in our country.
Perhaps I was naïve to think the political lectures would be limited to the comedy venues. Besides, what possesses a man clowning about on the street to think anyone will take his political opinions seriously is a mystery to me.
Edging past the crowd, we continued down the High Street, dodging people offering us flyers every few metres. As we turned onto North Bridge, a girl complimented me on my skirt, reassuring me that I wasn’t overdressed.
It was actually a coincidence that we were visiting Edinburgh during the Fringe. Nevertheless, it seemed a missed opportunity not to go to at least one show while we were there. On personal recommendation, we decided to give 4 Funny Feckers a chance. Since the show consists of the comedian Wes Dalton introducing four different acts, we thought it wouldn’t be so bad even if we didn’t like them, as they would only be on stage for 10–15 minutes each.
The venue was the basement of the The Hanover Tap bar. To take our seats, we had to squeeze ourselves between rows of folding metal chairs that were crammed uncomfortably close together. It was easy to understand the host Wes Dalton’s success as he bantered back and forth with some eccentric audience members. The final act, the Spanish comedian Sergi Polo, left me with a feeling of envy at how easily he could crack jokes in his second language, a feat I can only dream of achieving, despite my best efforts.
So, would I recommend visiting Edinburgh during the Fringe? Yes and no. Yes, because it’s certainly worth experiencing all the inevitable weirdness of the world’s largest arts festival. No, because if your goal is to see the city itself, you’d be much better off visiting at a time when the crowds are smaller and the hotel prices less exorbitant. As much as I enjoyed doing a quick tour of Edinburgh, my next visit will almost certainly be at a different time of year.

Posted: 12/4/2023 | December 4th, 2023
I never get tired of visiting Edinburgh. I love the enchanting cobblestone streets, the world-class whisky bars, the plethora of free museums, and arty vibe of the city (it’s the inspiration for many, many writers).
It has been Scotland’s capital since the 15th century and has a history that stretches back millennia (humans have been in the area since 8500 BCE). There’s an epic medieval castle, an ancient volcano, the historic Old Town, and the New Town (both of which are UNESCO World Heritage sites).
One of the best ways to soak it all up is by taking a walking tour. While ghost tours are some of the most popular here (Edinburgh is supposedly one of the most haunted cities in the world), there are many other tours to experience, from bike tours to food tours to pub crawls.
Here’s my list of the best walking tours in Edinburgh to help you plan your trip, save money, and make the most out of your stay!
Best Overall Tour
Learn More
This family-owned company specializes in a variety of tours of the vaults under the city (a labyrinth of tunnels that were first used as storage and workshop space for businesses in the early 17th century), and it’s the only company to offer vault tours during the day. Adult-only tours include the infamous Canongate graveyard and there are even vault tours designed for kids.
Tours start at 20 GBP.
Best Free Tour
Learn More
City Explorers runs four different free walking tours daily. Start with the classic Edinburgh Free Tour, on which you’ll see and learn about the main sights, including Edinburgh Castle, the Royal Mile, and St Giles’ Cathedral. There’s also a free ghost tour, a free Harry Potter tour, and a free New Town tour as well. Just remember to tip your guide at the end!
While those two are my top recommendations for tours in Edinburgh, here are a few more options to help you make the most of your time here:
Food is an important part of every culture. Scotland has all manner of interesting culinary delights, and the best way to learn more about them (while sampling a bunch) is by taking a food tour. Secret Food Tours offers the best one in Edinburgh. On their three-hour classic tour of Edinburgh’s Old Town, you’ll try delicacies like haggis, creamy Scottish cheese, neeps, and tatties (and learn what those even are), as well as enjoy traditional Scottish tea.
If you want to try more local spirits, you can take the Secret Whisky, Gin, & Beyond tour, which includes seven tastings of locally brewed and distilled liquors.
Prices start at 69 EUR.
Book here!
To cover more ground and get out of town a bit, take a bike tour. A Wee Pedal has several different offerings, so you can see more of Edinburgh and its surrounding countryside on two wheels. The most popular tour is the 20-mile loop tour, which circumnavigates the entire city. There’s also a 12-mile version that goes out to the rugged coastline for a more off-the-beaten-path adventure.
While rides are taken at a meandering, comfortable pace, you can also rent an e-bike for an extra 15 GBP if you’re not up for the challenge. You can also book special private tours, including one that ends at a brewery (tasting included), and a mountain bike tour.
Prices start at 65 GBP.
Book here!
If you’re looking to get genuinely creeped out, take a tour with City of the Dead. They offer several tours that go through the underground vaults. City of the Dead is also the only tour company with access to the ominously named Black Mausoleum and Covenanter’s Prison, some of the most haunted places in the world. These spots are favorites of the Mackenzie Poltergeist, considered one of the world’s best-documented supernatural entities, with hundreds of supposed encounters. It’s one of my favorite tours in the city!
Prices start at 19 GBP.
Book here!
One of TripAdvisor’s Top 10 Things to Do in the UK, the Mountebank Comedy Walk, run by Daniel Downie, an award-winning stand-up comedian, is undoubtedly the most hilarious way to see Auld Reekie (an old nickname for the city). On this tour you’ll laugh and learn not only about Edinburgh but all things Scottish, from culture to history to some famous (and infamous) people. And if you’re lucky, Daniel’s adorable dog Bonnie Prince might even join you.
Prices start at 22 GBP.
Book here!
One of the biggest walking tour companies in the UK, See Your City offers several fun tours in Edinburgh. Their best (and most popular) is the Harry Potter walking tour, on which you’ll visit the places that inspired JK Rowling as she penned her famous series (and the café where she did so). You’ll even get sorted into your Hogwarts house and get to test your book and movie knowledge in a quiz to earn points. It’s a super fun tour and a must for Harry Potter fans.
Other unique See Your City tours in Edinburgh include a Cheese Crawl and a True Crime walking tour.
Prices start at 16 GBP.

We didn’t know what to expect when we stepped out of Waverly Place in Edinburgh after a horrible train ride of sitting on the floor due to the rail strikes.
As we carried our bags up several flights of stairs because the escalator was broken, we were out of breath and had a minute to take in our surroundings.
To our right was a creepy, black, gothic-looking structure.
“Whoa, what is that?!” It looked like some kind of medieval church.
Entranced as we walked to our Airbnb, we stumbled upon more dark architecture. The buildings are incredible in Edinburgh and look like something out of a gothic movie.
As we trekked along, little did we know that our half-mile walk would be mostly stairs. We were lugging around our heavy bags, backpacks, and our limbs were tired from the previous days of walking.
Even though the weather was cool, we show up at the Airbnb out of breath and sweaty. Note to self: take a taxi back to the train station.
After we check in with our host, we notice the view of Edinburgh Castle from our window. Another example of the incredible architecture was just a…

When I first arrived in Edinburgh, I wasn’t sure what to expect. I’d only heard good things, but I was coming from continental Europe and to be honest, I wasn’t sure anywhere in the UK could beat the beauty of Spain, Portugal, or any other European country I visited. But Edinburgh proved me wrong!
While I only spent five days in Edinburgh, I’m already wanting to go back and for longer. This travel guide will help you fall in love with Edinburgh on your first (or next) trip to this dark academia paradise.
Edinburgh is known for many things, some fact, some fiction. It was the late Queen Elizabeth II’s favorite city, the place which inspired many iconic Harry Potter locations, and home to the largest performing arts festival in the world.
While Edinburgh has always been a worldly city, with many medieval and enlightenment scholars calling it home, the city has had its struggles over the years. Many movements against the British government sprouted up throughout the centuries and it was the central location for executions in Scotland. Talk about a deadly good time.

EDINBURGH is a beautiful city, filled with a rich history and colourful characters. It’s quite compact and walkable.
The mediaeval Old Town, which extends from Edinburgh Castle to the Palace of Holyroodhouse via the Royal Mile, is a great place to stroll about.
Here is the main tourist entrance to the castle, being guarded by a soldier of the Black Watch.
The statues that flank the entrance are of Robert the Bruce and William Wallace, who both fought against the English king Edward I in the Middle Ages when he tried to conquer Scotland. The red lion is a symbol of Scotland. The motto, Nemo me Impune Lacessit, means ‘let no-one disrespect me and get away with it’.
I wonder whether the projecting gutters at the top were used to pour boiling oil on its would-be conquerors? These included the Scots themselves when they tried to take it back from the English in a charge led by Robert the Bruce.
The statue that is on the left as you walk in, the one that is of Robert the Bruce, was created by a Scottish sculptor named Thomas Clapperton, who also has two works in the New Zealand town of Oamaru: The Wonderland Statue in a local children’s garden, and the statue that was created for Oamaru’s World War One memorial. You can see pictures of those statues here. So, that’s an amazing Kiwi link with Edinburgh Castle!
The castle also has cannons, which were last fired in earnest during the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745/46, when the castle was in the hands of the British government but the city had fallen to the Jacobites, supporters of the Stuart dynasty, which had been ousted after the death of the childless Queen Anne. It’s all very Game of Thrones.
The castle also has an impressive Great Hall as well as many other sights. These include the Scottish Crown Jewels, which no ordinary person is allowed to photograph.
You can get great views of the city from Edinburgh Castle, as in the next photograph.
There is lovely parkland just below the castle, as well. This park is called the Princes Street Gardens. It contains lots of statues, and I was very much struck by a monument to a poet of the 1700s named Allan Ramsay.
Here are some other street scenes, just to let you know that Edinburgh does have ordinary streets, after all. Though even these are pretty funky, for instance, the Old Tollbooth Wynd, or alley.
One thing I found interesting was the symbol of a deer with a cross in its antlers, which you can see on top of the old tollbooth and also on top of the building below, the Canongate Church on the Royal Mile. The statue just to the right, which looks like a real person at first, is of another poet of the 1700s, Robert Fergusson.
The deer with the cross represents a vision experienced by a saint named Hubert, who was a fanatical hunter but who, after spying a deer with a cross glowing between its antlers, devoted his life to being kind to animals thereafter.
(The same symbol appears on bottles of a German spirit called Jägermeister, meaning master hunter. The makers of Jägermeister have lately had to defend the use of St Hubert’s vision against the charge that it was an offence to religion to put it on a booze bottle. But I digress …)
Here is another interesting one. The Scots dialect, or language, is like English but full of words that are used differently. For instance, in Scots flesh is meat but in standard English flesh is what people are made of. So, ‘Fleshmarket’ looks kind of creepy to anyone who isn’t Scottish.
I also visited the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where most of the devolved Scottish government is now based. Holyroodhouse has also been a royal palace for many centuries, with perhaps its most famous occupant Mary, Queen of Scots, the queen that Elizabeth I of England imprisoned in the Tower of London and then beheaded. The great complex of Holyroodhouse includes the Queen’s Gallery, now an art gallery, with a Scottish red lion in a different pose.
I took quite a lot of photos of Holyroodhouse, or Holyrood Palace, when I was in Edinburgh a few years ago, and included them in collages for my book A Maverick Pilgrim Way. Here are some of the collages. The first photo is of another monument in the Princes Street Gardens, while the rest are of Holyrood.
This is another interesting symbol at Holyrood. It dates back to the time of the Scottish king James V (r. 1513–1542). Legend had it that only king could command a unicorn, shown duly chained, and so the unicorn was an important symbol of Scottish royal authority in those days.
Which is probably also where the all-British lion and unicorn device comes from as well. I think the lettering I R S probably stands for James (or Iames), Rex (king) of Scotland.
The Old Town is overlooked by an extinct volcano called Arthur’s Seat, from which you can get more views of the city. Here is a view of the city with the castle at the right and Arthur’s Seat at the left in the early 1700s.
The sketch is dedicated to Queen Anne, the last of the Scottish Stuart dynasty, who reigned over Great Britain and Ireland in the heyday of the real-life pirates of the Caribbean, and after whom the legendary real-life pirate ship Queen Anne’s Revenge was named.
Arthur’s seat is close to the centre of a park called Holyrood Park, which is both bigger and wilder than the Princes Street Gardens, a large area of raw nature in the middle of Edinburgh, though it was on the edge of town in Queen Anne’s day.
Here is a video of my rambles through the castle, the Royal Mile, up Arthur’s Seat, and in front of the Palace of Holyroodhouse, which was unfortunately closed to the public this time around because of Covid. But you could still watch the changing of the guard.
The nearby New Town has that name because it was laid out in the eighteenth century, which is new by Scottish standards.
The New Town has lots of parks itself, and grand circles and squares. It served as an inspiration for Washington DC and also for the New Zealand city of Dunedin, a name that means Edinburgh in Gaelic.
Edinburgh is also a city of great learning. This fact, along with the ancient Greek or Roman-style architecture of much of the New Town, caused the city to be nicknamed ‘the Athens of the North’.
In a similar vein, Calton Hill, which sports several monuments, is known as Edinburgh’s Acropolis.
When I was in Edinburgh a few years ago, Aunty June and I went to the castle at that time as well. We visited the St Margaret’s Chapel, part of Edinburgh Castle, built in the twelfth century and one of the oldest surviving buildings built in Edinburgh.
I have lost count of the number of times I have visited Edinburgh Castle, but let me tell you it never ceases to amaze and thrill me.
My grandmother had told Aunty June stories about how she, when she was a child, used to go to Edinburgh Castle and swing on the gates. I stood at the same gates for a little while and imagined what it would have been like for my grandmother to swing on them.
On that earlier visit, I also went to the Fringe Festival held annually in Edinburgh, which I loved. The Fringe Festival began in the 1940s as an add-on to an official, but rather stuffy, festival of the arts held in Edinburgh. The Fringe Festival showcased the acts that didn’t make it into the official Edinburgh festival. It soon acquired the reputation of being the more interesting place to hang out!
So, Edinburgh isn’t all old stuff by any means!
When I was there the previous time, I also went to the port district of Leith, where my grandmother was from.
This time around, things were a bit different. As I mention up by the video, Holyroodhouse was closed because of Covid.
You have to book online to get into the castle, as the numbers are restricted for the same reason. They told me at the castle that they let two hundred people in every half an hour, and cap the numbers at four hundred, and don’t allow more than five thousand in a day. Which I thought was a very good policy.
I’d never seen the Royal Mile so empty, even though there was a cruise ship in town.
In fact, the comparative absence of tourists was why I scaled Arthur’s Seat this time around, for the first time. It had always been too busy before.
Finally, car parking in Edinburgh is an absolute nightmare. I think I ended up paying about forty pounds for the day because I didn’t get in before eleven o’clock, and thus missed out on early-bird deals. Parking a bit further out of town and using public transport is a much better idea, if you are organised enough.
In my next post, I visit the Cairngorms National Park and Inverness!

The village of Glencoe, Scotland is known for its incredible hiking, nature and landscape. However, if you fly into Edinburgh (as many tourists do) you will quickly realize that it, along with the rest of the highlands, are pretty hard to get to. Specifically, it takes around 3 hours to get to Glencoe by car and almost 4.5 hours via public transport. Renting a car is expensive and taking public transport restricts your schedule to that of trains and buses.
On my recent trip to Edinburgh I faced this conundrum — I really wanted to do a day hike, however, I did not want to deal with renting a car and driving all the way to the highlands. This is when I discovered The Pentlands. A hilly nature preserve located just 20 minutes from Edinburgh city center, these hills (or maybe even mini-mountains) are perfect for a day hike without much planning. If you want incredible views of Edinburgh along with the surrounding Scottish countryside The Pentlands are a great option.
While I am definitely not the resident expert on The Pentlands or other hikes near Edinburgh, I want to provide a guide based on my own experience. The following guide is purely anecdotal and illustrates steps that are specific to my travel style. That being said, hopefully it is still helpful in some way. I really did not see many guides on hiking the Pentlands available online when I was looking to get there — hopefully this clarifies some things!
While staying in Edinburgh I tried to research the closest entrance point to the park from the city. I found that Midlothian Snowsports Centre in Hillend provides a more lowkey trail entrance. If you’re staying in Edinburgh city center this entrance is only 23 minutes by car and at the time of my trip cost me only 10£ by Uber. If you’re looking for an even cheaper option the number 15 bus line to Easter Brush stops directly at the Snowsports Center and runs fairly frequently from Princes Street in the center of the city. Either option is great, just make sure you have a plan to get back into the city after your hike (I will talk more about this later)!
So when I finally got to Midlothian Snowsports Centre I was pretty confused on how to actually get into The Pentlands. After some searching I spoke with the desk clerk at the Snowsports center and made my way over to the right of the building. Up that direction is a very inconspicious trail head gently sloping upwards into the park itself. While its very easy to miss, its totally worth the climb! Below is an annotated map depicting the entrance, as you can see its to the right and very lowkey.
As you can probably see in the photo above, the entrance trail was nothing more than a dirt road running up into the rolling Scottish hills — perfect! Its worth noting that this entrance path splits into two options: one steeper and one more gradual, both incline to the top of Caerketton Hill (in the background horizon of the photo). I really enjoyed this part of the hike, the view just kept getting better and better.
Now i’d be lying if I said this was an easy uphill walk. While I did take the steeper path, i’d definitely be prepared for a workout! The view are really super worth it — you can slowly see all of Edinburgh spread out below you.
Honestly pictures don’t do it justice. At Caerketton Hill peak you can see the vast majority of The Pentlands sprawled out ahead of you. To get to the top of Caerketton Hill it definitely takes ~30 minutes, which really isn’t bad if you want some incredible views of the city and the rest of the park. If you’re like me and need a few hours of walking to be satisfied you can continue to follow the trail deeper and deeper into the Scottish countryside; however, if you’re done you can just as easily turn back to the snow center and get a beer in the city.
Here’s the view facing away from Edinburgh (and deeper into the park itself). You can totally see the long sprawling trails the seem to go on forever. You can also see some pretty cool sheep that I tried to pet, but they were clearly not interested.
Now above is route that I took through the park. Overall I highly recommend planning your exit strategy ahead of time. In general I found that this route was a perfect mix for adventure/direction for me. The majority kept me on trails climbing and descending the rolling hill, while the end added a bit of spontaneity to my journey.
What do I mean by spontaneity? Well, I did not exactly plan my trip back into Edinburgh. This got me stuck crossing private fields and a military base to actually make it back to the main road (A702). While the views were still awesome (see below), I only recommend it if you’re up for an adventure. If you want a more legit route you can easily circle backwards to the snowcenter or continue further on.
There really aren’t any towns along A702 in the location that this spit me out at. Because of this, I recommend bringing a phone with plenty of charge to call an Uber back into the city. My phone was dead at this point and I ended up hitchhiking back to the nearest metro station.
Overall I think my entire hike took ~4.5 hours so I was able to leave around 9:30 am and be back just in time for lunch. Not bad for less than a 30 minute ride. Next time I go to Scottland, I really hope to checkout the Highlands, however, if you’re limited on time (like I was) I recommend checking out The Pentlands! If you made it here, thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed my story/guide.

Part Two of our Three Part coverage of the 2023 Edinburgh Festival Fringe.Find Part One here.Find Part Three here.
In 1947, a post-WW2 Europe came together to celebrate the arts at the newly formed Edinburgh International Festival. Eight theatre companies who had not been invited decided to show up anyway, and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe was created — the first-ever “Fringe Festival.” Since then, cities around the world have formed their own versions of the Fringe, but the original remains the largest. In fact, it holds the record as the largest performing arts festival in the world.
For its 2023 edition, 3,553 shows graced 288 venues all across the city — transforming the medieval streets of the Scottish capital into a bustling hub of creativity. With so many productions during the festival’s three-and-a-half-week run, crafting an itinerary proved to be a daunting task. But with the help of a few Excel spreadsheets, a good pair of walking shoes, and a very full calendar, I was able to see 57 shows during my seven days in Edinburgh — a mere 1.6% of the overall lineup, but a solid dive into the Fringe’s immersive offerings.
Here are my fifteen favorite immersive shows from the 2023 Edinburgh Festival Fringe (including a few in the Edinburgh International Festival):
Big Kid Kindergarten — Play Immersive (USA)
As adults, we don’t often get the time, space, or permission to play. Interests become hobbies become side hustles, and unstructured play is set aside in favor of adulting. Big Kid Kindergarten invites us to reconnect with our childhood selves.
At the beginning of the experience, Soleil Kohl, our teacher for the next hour, asks us to close our eyes and connect with our inner five-year-old. A variety of familiar items are strewn across the room — legos, Play-Doh, coloring books, crafting materials, and plushies. We choose the songs that play in the background — nursery rhymes, Barney, Sharon Lois & Bram — the soundtrack of our childhoods. As our class time comes to an end, we tidy up the space and then cuddle up with a pillow for a quick nap time.
It’s a simple concept and straightforward execution, but a surprisingly emotional experience for some (myself included) largely due to the insight, guidance, and warmth with which Kohl facilitates.
Bodies — Ray Young (UK)
After a twenty-minute Scotrail ride away from the bustle of the festival city, I find myself floating in the pool at Deans Community High School. Colored lights, a sprinkler, and miscellaneous inflatables scatter across the surface of the water. We’ve all been given the identity of a specific international body of water and told that this pool is the gathering place where we’re all to connect. Twinkling projections fill the space and soothing music fills the air.
There’s an oft-used analogy of immersive theatre being likened to immersion in water. As such, the venue and conceit of Bodies seem quite fitting. Though the show offers little in terms of narrative, the space became a place for meditation, and a welcome moment of calm amongst the busyness of the Festival.
Brave Space — Aloft (USA)
We stand gathered around a sheet. When given the signal, our hands grasp its edges and we lift it above our heads, walk underneath, and then lower it beneath our feet. We’ve built a big top, but this one is more intimate than most — the quarters are cramped such that the delineation between stage and audience is blurred. Hoops spin unnervingly close by, acrobats swing from a trapeze directly above my head, and props are handed to us for safekeeping. At one point, I hold onto a piece of rope alongside four other audience members while the performers, kept aloft by the rope and their trust in a handful of strangers, twirl in the air.
‘Audience participation’ and ‘acrobatics’ are two phrases that don’t often appear together. The latter requires peak physical conditioning, hours of practice, and great technical ability… the former an unpredictable entity. By combining these two, Aloft has created a genuine immersive circus experience and necessitated the creation of a brave, trusting, space on both sides to make it work.
Club Life — Fred Deakin (UK)
In Club Life, Fred Deakin tours us through the Edinburgh underground club scene of the 80s and 90s that he helped shape. But this exercise goes beyond a typical bout of reminiscing — instead of simply telling us about the parties he lovingly crafted and DJ’d, Deakin invites us onto the dancefloor to experience them ourselves.
With a few DJ decks, vinyl records, and a cast of dancers, key moments in Deakin’s musical life are recreated onstage. From the genre agnosticism of Thunderball to the delightfully quirky Misery (“the worst club night that there ever was or ever could be,”) we dance our way through seven distinct parties from his past.
Part dance party, part autobiography, Club Life is an engaging and heartwarming deep dive into a creative soul.
Ctrl Room :_ — Black Hound Productions (UK)
In the not-so-distant future, technology has changed the face of the battlefield. Armed with lethal AI innovations, tech giant Polemas has become a global military powerhouse. As I enter the Edinburgh Army Reserve Centre, I’m greeted by a uniformed individual. Are they part of the show or an army member using the space? This blurring of show vs. reality was present throughout the experience and contributed to Ctrl Room :_ being the most immersive production I attended during the festival.
After choosing to align myself with the civilian resistance, I’m brought to their control room. Over the next 60 minutes, we identify an aerial strike drone, build explosive weapons, devise a military strategy, and attempt to decode a mysterious device. Meanwhile, our opponents at Polemas work through their own set of challenges, and every action, puzzle solved, and decision made by both sides influences the final outcome.
Throughout, our rebel leaders emphasize the urgency of the task at hand — some of the best acting I’ve ever seen in an escape room environment. The overall experience felt so realistic that at one point I found myself cowering under a table in genuine fear. As we exited the room for the finale, bulletproof vests on our chests and Molotov cocktails in hand, I mentally steeled myself for the battlefield… then breathed a sigh of relief when we were instead led to a cutscene in the initial briefing room.
Food — Geoff Sobelle (USA) [International Festival]
Food is a playful and thoughtful exploration of society’s relationship with food — from the grandiosity of the fine dining industry to the humble origins, and increasingly complicated reality of the agricultural systems that feed us.
While sitting around a large fine dining table, Sobelle hands me a wine menu with a very specific set of instructions: I should not drink the glass of wine he’s about to pour for me. Instead, I’m asked to smell the liquid and connect the scent to a year and memory. The odor of whiteboard marker fills my nose and I share an early high school memory. A mix of magic, cleverness, and absurdity brings this half of the show to life. An order of salmon rolls is conjured from thin air, an impromptu trip to the “Arctic” produces the freshest of arctic char, and our enigmatic waiter decides to scarf down all the leftovers. The magic elements may not be the most elegant I’ve seen — Sobelle’s sleight of hand is at times visible, but this is easily forgiven as the true magic lies in the delightful absurdity of the situation.
As the restaurant “closes” for the night, Sobelle pulls the tablecloth off — dishes and all — to reveal a large surface of dirt underneath. He crawls into the space, unaffected by the damage being done to his dress shirt and slacks. From here, a once chatty Sobelle guides us in a silent demonstration of the industrialization of farming, as well as the infrastructure and communities that we built around it.
They say it’s bad manners to play with your food, but for Geoff Sobelle I think we can make an exception. With charm and a healthy dose of playfulness, Food is a thoughtful and whimsical meditation on an important industry.
Funeral — Ontroerend Goed (Belgium)
“If you want to remember, remember.If you want to forget, forget.But sometimes, when you want to remember you forget.But sometimes, when you want to forget your remember”
So go the translated lyrics of the Latin song we’re taught at the beginning of Funeral. The show, by immersive stalwarts Ontroerend Goed, is a collective ritual celebrating finiteness and the knowledge that we are not alone in whatever endings we mourn.
From start to end, Funeral emphasizes the importance of community. In one of the most unique openings I’ve experienced, we’re directed to shake hands with each and every audience member as we enter the room. Later, we pass logs down from person to person until each individual has a post to sit on. At the start of the show, we are offered the chance to share the names of those we are mourning. As these names are read out loud, I feel my eyes prickle with tears, and look around the room to see my emotions mirrored in the faces of others.
The most notable display of community-building that Funeral initiated was inviting people to the venue’s basement for a cup of post-show tea. This created a space where audience members could unpack the experience together. While many shows at this year’s Fringe emphasized the importance of community and connection, Funeral’s poignant joint rituals and creation of space for discussion made it the most successful at exploring these themes.
Hayfever — Emerge Production House (UK)
Hayfever has the honor of being the “fringiest” show I had the pleasure of seeing at the festival.
As I walk into the room, a hot pink gorilla hands me two pieces of cardstock, one red and one green. We’re told that we’re actually in outer space and part of the studio audience for a TV show. At certain times, we can vote for an outcome using our colored cards, and at any point in the show, we can pause the action to request a monologue, a musical theatre number, an interpretive dance, or an on-the-spot “auction” of any item on stage. All the while, a drama about love, murder, xenophobia, and feminism unfolds.
It sounds chaotic, and once us audience members get the hang of things, it absolutely is. Heartfelt speeches are interrupted by songs about ham; during an auction, I deprive the male lead of his glasses; a monologue reveals the nefarious purpose this television program serves and the classist structures that keep it running. There’s too much going on, and the ambitiousness of the conceit often leaves me confused, but it’s just so much fun.
Klanghaus: Darkroom — KlangHaus (UK)
“Try and keep your eyes open.” But as I sit alone in the church basement, the lights starting to dim, the urge to shut my eyes is persistent. Eyes-open darkness is a very different sensation from eyes-closed darkness. Music fills the air, and I feel my body begin to relax. As the sound of waves crashing fills the room, the percussive reverberation of drums fills my chest. I didn’t notice at first, but live instruments are being played all around me. I’ve become so accustomed to pre-recorded sound within immersive audio experiences, so this realization catches me off guard and leaves me with a giant grin.
As the music calms to silence, the lights switch on and I’m escorted onto a couch. There, I unpack the experience with the two musicians who moved from instrument to instrument — counting their steps in the dark — to perform for me.
Whereas Klanghaus’ other Fringe show, Klanghaus: Inhaus, is a communal audio-visual experience, Darkroom is its antithesis — a solo experience in the dark. Both allowed me to engage in the music on a deeper level, but in the eyes wide open darkness of Klanghaus: Darkroom, I felt an intense, personal connection with the music.
Lucy and Friends — Soho Theatre, John Mackay and United Agents (UK)
After being recommended the show by a friend, I purchased a ticket to Lucy and Friends — an effort to diversify my Fringe showgoing. Halfway through the opening number, while covered in confetti and being crawled on by a tree cosplayer, I realized this show would probably count as immersive.
Lucy and Friends is a one-woman show where the role of “Lucy” is performed by the absurdly hilarious Lucy McCormick, and the role of “Friends” is played by the entire audience. Song sheets are distributed as we enter the venue, glasses of wine are shared with the audience, and we’re even tasked with cleaning up the theater. At the end of the show, a cell phone is passed around and audience members enter their contact info to start a group text chat.
Hilarious and unexpected, Lucy and Friends consistently caught me off guard while I absolutely laughed my head off.
Sensuous Governing — Sisters Hope (Denmark)
A line forms outside the Danish Consulate building, where a veiled figure in a white blouse and floor-length skirt stands barefoot. One by one, she beckons us forward and instructs us to remain silent as we fill out a cryptic questionnaire about the current state of our body, mind, and society as a whole.
Thus, began one of the most curious and thought-provoking experiences I had throughout my time at the Fringe. Over the next hour and a half I dance with a stranger, engage in a tender staring contest, and walk blindfolded up a spiral staircase. Throughout, the ethereal “Sisters” serve as my guide, their every motion a delicate dance whose tenderness I can sense even with my eyes bound.
It’s difficult to describe what makes Sensuous Governing so beautiful. It’s a strange experience, and will definitely leave some participants skeptical, but I also found it incredibly moving. As I exited the building, I locked eyes with another audience member. We tried to discuss what we had both just experienced but were at a loss for words — perhaps in part a side effect of having remained silent for so long. Finally, we both agreed, “That was really special.”
The Lost Lending Library — Punchdrunk Enrichment (UK) [International Festival]
At 314 floors high and with 78 spiral-side departments, this library is the largest collection of books and stories in the entire world. But, as the title suggests, it’s currently lost and we’ll need some expert-level storytellers to find it.
The Lost Lending Library by Punchdrunk Enrichment (Punchdrunk’s educational and outreach arm) is an enchanting immersive experience designed for children. The show is a fine example of entertainment talking to children rather than talking down to them, and in doing so creates a memorable experience for both kids and their accompanying adults. Throughout the performance, the actors engage directly with the young audience members, who field every query and conversation with an ease and creativity far superior to what you’d ever find in an adult audience.
Once we do find the library, even the most skeptical of adults is in awe. The set is absolutely gorgeous, filled with intricate details and surprises to be uncovered. It’s a real treat to see Punchdrunk’s immersive magic go to work at teaching the importance of storytelling. As we leave the library, we’re each handed a special “library card,” and from the squeals of excitement this garners, you can tell that Punchdrunk’s teachings have made a genuine impact.
The Most Toast — RGB Monster (UK)
The premise is simple: “Somebody in the audience will have eaten the most toast. We will find them.”
Armed with a large piece of chart paper, a permanent marker, and a wonderfully dry sense of wit, hosts Katharyn Henson and Ollie Horn interrogate the audience as to the quantity of their toast consumption. Approximations are not permitted. Uncertainty is dismissed. This is a serious scientific inquiry, and they accept nothing but precise measurements.
Charts are charted. Calculators are utilized. Integrity is called into question. Then, a winner is chosen and brought onstage for a celebration fitting of a toast-eating champion. The Most Toast is what happens when a brilliantly simple hook, a quick-witted pair of hosts, and an enthusiastic audience come together. It’s everything it’s advertised to be, but with a level of commitment that elevates its silliness into hilarity.
Two Strangers Walk Into A Bar — Tilda Cobham-Hervey (Australia)
I sit down at a bar. Someone hands me a suspiciously heavy tote bag and a headset, then tells me everything I’ll need is contained within. And that’s how my meet-cute begins… but maybe reality has different plans.
Through a series of audio prompts, worksheets, and semi-scripted dialogue, Two Strangers Walk Into A Bar creates the circumstances for a real-life rom-com to unfold. Except, instead of falling in love with a stranger, all that quirkiness and convenient serendipity sets you up to fall in love with that beautiful, messy, unpredictable thing called real life.
Humanity-affirming, grin-inducing, and absolutely charming, Two Strangers Walk Into A Bar is one of the most memorable immersive experiences I’ve ever had.
Without Sin — Without Sin (Ireland)
Two strangers enter a confessional booth and through a series of guided questions leave with a knowledge of the other far greater than what a typical 20-minute conversation would create.
As I step inside the dimly lit booth, I slip the provided headphones over my ears. Soothing music fills the space, and a voice instructs me to open the slot on my right where a deck of cards is placed. One by one, my companion and I take turns drawing from the pile and asking each other the questions written on them. “Have you ever taken something that wasn’t yours?” “What’s something you used to believe that you don’t anymore?” “Who are you most worried about disappointing?” We volley back and forth, sometimes offering elaborate responses, other times opting for more cryptic answers. Unable to see the face of our partner, all we can do is focus on the inflections in their voice.
The end of the experience arrives all too soon, and we are prompted to write a note to our partner. I reflect on the morsels of truth and vulnerability she shared and pen a heartfelt wish for a stranger I barely know, yet find myself rooting for. As we exit the booth, we embrace, squeezing each other tight through slightly teary eyes. Human connection is a beautiful thing, and Without Sin fosters it in a simple, but beautiful way.

If you’re like me (part Scottish) then a trip to Edinburgh, Scotland will be a bit more than relax and snap. I found it very important to visit the place my last name originated and was pleasantly surprised with my overall experience. I did my research and opted to bed down in Edinburgh. There, I’d have a wide range of cultural and historical amenities within walking distance or a quick cab ride. Edinburgh is a very beautiful city, and it’s lush charm is a mix of Vancouver and Prague rolled into one. With a 5-day itinerary in hand, I knew I’d have to make the most of it and pancake what I could, so I could deliver an article worthy of your time. So if you’re ever down for the Scottish experience, here are Travel Daddy’s 10 WAYS I ENJOYED SCOTLAND WHILE IN EDINBURGH…
I can honestly say without apprehension that Edinburgh has the best Taxi drivers I’ve seen or experienced on the planet. They’re prompt, courteous, knowledgeable, friendly, humble, and honorable. It’s actually quite a contrast from what I experienced in Santiago, where my safety was threatened. I would be more apt to describe them as mobile micro tour guides, possessing a high social IQ and left you with the impression that most -if not all- actually drive tourists around because they like it!
Tip them you cheap bastard — they deserve it!
2. WHISKY A DO
Oh mighty Scotch Whisky- the nectar of the Gods! Aside from Coffee and a choice Cab, nothing assaults the palette like a dram of fine aged whisky. Whether it be blended, aged or cheap, Scotland IS the mecca of Whisky. There are several options to get your fix; for me, the day tour to Loch Ness had an added bonus of visiting a legit distillery- DEANSTON.
After the tour and tasting, I couldn’t resist purchasing their premier 23 yr old. It ran me high, but every bit worth the cost since you can’t get it anywhere but there. A few days later as I exited Edinburgh Castle, I saw THE SCOTCH WHISKY EXPERIENCE, conveniently nestled on the 1st right side corner. It is home to the World’s Largest Collection of Scotch Whisky.
It Cost what!?!?!
My arrogance was quelled when upon bragging to the hosts/scotch experts that I’m on my 3rd bottle of Johnny Walker Blue ownership, they redirected my attention to truly rare and expensive whisky. I actually considered selling my house for the novelty. My son doesn’t really need to go to college right? I was even more exasperated to learn that some “poor” chap a week prior purchased a $25,000 Pound bottle and spent a total of over $40K Pounds. I’ll get there one day. There’s also a cool whisky chart which matches the flavor to the brand, for novice drinkers like myself.
Buy a bottle — Live a little!
3. LOCH NESS & HIGHLANDS DAY TRIP
I booked this day tour offered by The Hairy Coo through Trip Advisor. They offer many other tours throughout Scotland, but this one was convenient and enticing, especially with the whisky tour. The 10 hour itinerary was well thought out and included key stops like the Highland Hairy Coos, Glencoe, Whisky Distillery, Fort Augustus — home to Loch Ness, the Commando Memorial, Cairngorm Park, and Pitlochry. You can check the full itinerary here. Although Loch Ness was beautiful and worth the trip, you’ll be sorely disappointed to not catch a glimpse of it’s most famous inhabitant.
TOUR HIGHLIGHTS
What a Bridge!
On your return, you’ll cross and witness three amazing bridges adjacent to each other, one of which — The Forth Bridge- is a UNESCO site. The tour guide was friendly, knowledgeable and brimming with that Scottish wit.
Well worth the day — at least once!
4. FINE DINING
So many options- so much quality. Edinburgh is definitely a foodie destination for fine dining. You should check out my list of 10 AMAZING RESTAURANT & FOOD EXPERIENCES IN EDINBURGH. From traditional dishes like Haggis, Neeps & Tatties, to exclusive restaurants booked up months in advance, Scotland definitely has the food chops to satisfy your taste buds.
Food is most definitely a worthy Splurge- do it!
5. SO MANY PUBS… AMAZING SPEAKEASIES… GREAT NIGHTLIFE
As expected, I encountered more pubs in a 1 mile radius in Edinburgh than anywhere I’d been outside the U.K. People love to drink, and a pubs like The Advocate, The Cafe Royal Circle Bar and The Bow Bar, stood out for me as great places to knock down a few cold ones. If you fancy top-notch cocktails then there are some speakeasy type bars of high caliber like Panda & Sons and Head & Tails. For a speakeasy in the truest sense you’ll have to search the alleyways for Bullard & Worth — I won’t give you the address, but instead give you a clue. Most locals don’t even know how to find it, and it’s location on google maps was incorrect (purposely?). I had to ask several people and store owners in what felt like a treasure hunt.
Success at last…
I finally found what I had been looking for- approached, knocked, and was rewarded. The bartender was as an amazing conversationalist as he was a cocktail wizard. I’ll say no more so good luck!
As far as clubbing there are a ton of options from clubs teeming with college-aged patrons, salsa dancing, hip-hop lovers and live music. My article 10 BEST NIGHTLIFE IN EDINBURGH SCOTLAND will give you a list of good recommendations when you’re in town.
Edinburgh has great nightlife — party on!
6. CRASH A TRUE SCOTTISH WEDDING… THEN GET KICKED OUT
There I am- minding my own business at Ghillie Dhu, when I’m approached by a kilt-wearing Scotsman who wants me to buy him a pint. I oblige and as a reward he takes me upstairs to the reserved hall to see a “true Scottish wedding” as he put it. After a few drinks and introductions to the groom, I’m taking it all in being particularly wary of my visitor status. I stand to the side respectfully and silently appreciate how folks from all walks of life celebrate life’s milestones similarly but in their own unique way.
Uh-Oh….
Unfortunately, no one told the bride and ten minutes later, I’m being awkwardly escorted out of the wedding by the stoic security. No love lost though- since it was worth the experience and good blog fodder. I’m not encouraging you to intrude on someone’s big day, but try to synch with the locals in some way and get a true experience as to how folks live and celebrate.
People are different, but the same — even in Edinburgh!
7. SEE LEITH THEN WALK AIMLESSLY UNTIL PORTOBELLO
I took a cab down to Leith- a historic and artsy port Northeast of Edinburgh’s city center. It’s a must-see with top-notch restaurants, pubs and home to the Royal Yacht Britannia. The weather was great so I opted for a stroll along the canal, then made my way back inland toward the Leith Links (public parks). After catching some cricket and picnics, I headed back to the shore for some photography.
How’d I get Here?
Two hours later I’m in Portobello and realized with no cab in sight, I’d have to trek it back to the city. Using the street signs, I self-navigate past Holyrood Park and if not for my impending dinner reservations, would have walked back all the way. A kind local gives me exact change for the bus fare back to my hotel and I fulfill my dinner plans.
Great scenery & photos off the beaten path — dress for the walk!
8. STUMBLE UPON A TRADITIONAL MUSIC BAND COMPETITION
It’s a Sunday and I finally decide upon Princes Street Gardens, which is literally a stone’s throw from my hotel. With camera in hand, I knew I’d score some great shots by way of the park’s natural beauty. It’s descended location gives an almost serene respite from the bustling streets above. It isn’t long before I hear an army of bagpipes and drums. I was pleasantly surprised to spectate dozens of traditional bands practicing and performing in a competition- free to the public. I snapped away and appreciated the unique experience. The park is not open 24/7, and is worth a visit especially with kids in tow.
The Edinburgh 2019 Pipe Band Championship was amazing- the Gardens are still worth a visit!
9. BE AMAZED BY HISTORY IN OLD TOWN
There is history everywhere in the buildings, streets and closes (alleyways) of Edinburgh. If you’re a history buff or lover of things ancient, then Edinburgh is a mine of activities. Edinburgh Castle was built upon remnants of an extinct volcano, and from its elevated point you can see much of this beautiful city. A great portion of New Town with this area has been categorized as a UNESCO Heritage Site. As you descend down the cobbler streets, you’ll probably catch one of the many guided tours such as the Harry Potter Walking Tour. Much of the books and films were inspired by the streets and architecture of Old Town Edinburgh. I personally find it fascinating to walk among buildings that are older than the U.S. as a nation.
History can be awesome- don’t miss it!
10. WALK THE ROYAL MILE
The ROYAL MILE is the main street running from Edinburgh Castle all the way down to Holyrood Park. You’ll find a variety of top tourist sites like Arthur’s Seat, Edinburgh Museum, Scottish Parliament, St. Giles Cathedral, and Holyrood Palace. You can stop at several pubs and eateries along the way, easily spending a full day experiencing all it has to offer. I definitely had a blast and have the pics to prove it.
Grab your camera- This is Edinburgh!

Before coming to the United Kingdom, as an Asian girl, the most common cities that have been heard of were London, Manchester, and Edinburgh. However, unlike the previous two cities, Edinburgh is the city I got highly recommended many times as it will give a different impression of a United Kingdom city from London and Manchester.
This recommendation made me put it on the top of the travel list to visit instantly once I have time. When I finally know there is a chance to travel to Edinburgh, I look forward to this trip and find out why this city can earn that acclamation from people there before.
Once I stepped out of the train station, I instantly noticed why this city left such a fantastic feeling for visitors. But, of course, the first reaction that came to my mind was, ‘Am I in the United Kingdom?’.
Scotland’s capital city, unlike London or Manchester, emphasizes constructing a modern financial centre for people. The urban planning of Edinburgh has shown both the historical and contemporary image to tell its story to people who first visit this city.

Background: In 2022, the Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (TAS) programme funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) brought together experts in key disciplines across the UK to investigate the responsibility dimension of AI-driven autonomous systems, especially in areas where we might realistically expect that AI systems will be used to complement or substitute for human decision making.
On the 10th of July 2023, the four Responsibility project teams met in Edinburgh, Scotland to share the preliminary findings of our research, and to identify any common ground across our very different approaches to the challenge, which range across computer science, robotics, philosophy, law and the social sciences. Our declaration here, which will soon be followed by an expanded version including concrete examples of application to AI and autonomous systems, reflects that common ground.
We hope it will start a wider conversation about what matters most when we talk about “Responsible AI’ and responsibility for autonomous systems.*
*This declaration is a collaboration among researchers in the UKRI Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (TAS) programme who work on Responsibility in the context of design, development, procurement, use, governance and regulation of AI and autonomous systems. It does not necessarily represent the views of the wider TAS programme, its partners or universities.
Preface: Our work has crystallised a shared belief in the possibility of responsible development and governance of AI and autonomous systems (AI/AS). However novel the challenges these technologies present, they are not beyond the reach of responsibility, as a set of mature social and technical practices that underpin trustworthiness. We have been here before, with other inherently risky technologies that seemed ungovernable. And yet, those technologies that became part of the trusted infrastructure of many societies — biomedical technologies, aviation, automobiles, steam power — are now largely governed in ways that enable innovation and its benefits without pushing all of the risk and cost onto unprotected publics.
We must advance AI/AS innovation toward its own stage of trusted maturity: by creating, promoting, and embedding robust and committed responsibility practices in the development and use of AI/AS. Our joint declaration proposes four shifts in the framing of responsibility that we believe are needed for the responsible development, procurement, use and governance of AI and autonomous systems, in the UK and beyond.
First, it may help to briefly clarify some of the different meanings that ‘responsibility’ can have in this context:
Four Key Shifts on Responsibility Needed to Achieve Responsible AI
1. Accepting responsibility over describing and ascribing responsibility
2. Seeing responsibility as relational over seeing responsibility as an agent property
3. Prioritising responsibility as attending to vulnerability over responsibility as blame
4. Focusing on sustainability of responsible AI/AS innovation over pace of innovation
ANALYSIS:
Our research projects draw from technical, social, and humanistic disciplines to study distinct forms of responsibility (moral, legal, causal, role or virtue) as they apply in practice to responsible AI and autonomous systems (AI/AS) development, deployment and governance. Much of our work describes how, when, and which of these notions of responsibility should be attributed to the different types of agents (human and machine) that make up sociotechnical systems like AI/AS.
A deep understanding of these dimensions is essential for the future of responsible AI/AS. Appeals to responsibility are only effective when we can be clear and specific about what it means in any given context. But we hold that however rigorous our research on responsibility, its future impact depends upon the collective will of the actors who shape and govern our tech ecosystem to act on it.
Responsibility can be analysed in minute detail, but if responsibility is never accepted, never taken by the actors with the power to do so, these studies will be impotent, their power to guide action wasted. Our research must, to have its intended impact, be paired with bold and ongoing commercial and public commitments to accept responsibility for the power and consequences of autonomous systems.
2. Seeing responsibility as relational over responsibility as an agent property
The single thread that binds our projects is the power of responsibility to enable and sustain trustworthy relationships between people, organisations, institutions and publics. How AI/AS impact these relationships is why responsibility matters in this context.
Yet responsibility is too often viewed solely as an isolated property of an agent or system. We seek to find the ‘responsible’ component that caused a harm or accident, or the ‘responsible’ human that is morally accountable or legally liable for it, without considering the relationships that such attributions of responsibility help to hold together.
Even when we seek to understand what makes an agent in some way responsible for an action or decision, it’s the human relationships affected by that action or decision that make this question so important for us to answer. These relationships, and the responsibilities they entail, vary and shift over time and in different contexts. For this reason, mere promises to ‘act responsibly’ or ‘design responsibly’ are less helpful than articulating the ongoing, evolving duties of care that publics rightly expect and that people, organisations and institutions must fulfil to protect the specific relationships in which they and AI/AS are embedded. We hold that the relationships that responsibility serves must move to the centre of ‘responsible AI/AS’ research and its uses.
3. Prioritising responsibility as attending to vulnerability over responsibility as blame
Most studies of responsibility in AI/AS focus on mechanisms for responsibility attribution and the distribution of blame, liability or other obligations to responsible parties. While this work is essential, it is often silent about the vital political function of responsibility: to establish conditions of legitimacy for the human exercise of power, by requiring those who use or unleash a power to demonstrate due care for the interests of those it makes vulnerable.
While we must do more to identify and hold accountable those who use AI/AS in irresponsible and harmful ways, responsible AI/AS is not merely about finding and sanctioning ‘bad actors.’ All who exercise and unleash the material and economic power of AI/AS, even with the best of intentions, must start attending — and be required to attend — responsibly to the vulnerabilities that AI/AS create, perpetuate, amplify or relieve.
Foregrounding the needs of the most vulnerable, led by their knowledge of the lived impact of new technologies, also generally results in better protections for all; it is the most reliable way to ensure that AI/AS are safe and beneficial for everyone. Otherwise, by unjustly endangering human lives and publics, those who build and deploy these tools surrender the social license for these technologies as legitimate powers.
4. Focusing on sustainability of responsible AI/AS innovation over pace of innovation
Much of the debate around AI and autonomous systems focuses on the ideal pace of responsible innovation — calls to speed it up (for those whose primary aim is economic growth and rapid realization of technology’s potential benefits) and calls to slow it down (for those whose primary aim is the safety, security and competent control of AI/AS).
While this debate exposes important concerns, we think both impulses result from a misplaced focus on the overall pace at which AI/AS innovation happens, rather than what is needed to make AI/AS innovation sustainable, in the UK and globally.
Some applications of AI/AS, for example in the health and climate tech areas, warrant accelerated research and development, in responsible ways. Others, such as the automation of moral and political human judgments with irreversible and severe consequences, arguably require delay or indefinite pause. Yet we call for centering the overarching question: how to make a responsible AI/AS innovation ecosystem sustainable.
Sluggish AI/AS innovation that stalls from lack of investment and public confidence will not serve the UK or the world well. Yet neither will rapid, unchecked innovation that lasts only a few years or decades before running out of public goodwill and available resources.
AI/AS are already placing great demands on our limited global resources (water, energy, rare earth minerals), new stresses on social and economic resilience, and growing challenges for security, human rights and social cohesion. These costs and stressors must be managed responsibly and holistically, with an eye to AI/AS innovation that can take us all much farther, not simply faster.
We invite those from across the ‘Responsible AI’ community and beyond to comment and help us develop and refine these provocations; in the coming weeks we will share an expanded version with concrete examples of applications of these four shifts in Responsible AI research and innovation.

What I loved about Edinburgh was being able to walk to work through a beautiful place.
– Roger Allam
Sangam and I visited Edinburgh with our friends in December 2023. We visited this charming city for a day trip.
It was a long drive from Newcastle upon Tyne to Edinburgh for us. As we drove towards Edinburgh, we doubted if it was a good decision to drive in this weather. The weather was worse with heavy rains and harsh wind. Driving became extremely difficult and tedious for us. However, we managed to reach Edinburgh around 2 p.m.
It was still cloudy, but we were glad that it was at least not raining. We wasted no time and decided to search for a restaurant for lunch. The experience of walking around the city was incredibly beautiful and surreal. The place was as charming and exquisite as I had read in the books.

A new act asked me for advice on how to write their debut Edinburgh fringe show… I don’t think anyone knows how it’s supposed to be done, but I jotted down some notes, then turned it into this post in the hope it might help others.
I’m Ollie Horn, and you can see me live! Click here for my tour dates.
The reason you’re doing Edinburgh is you’ll get to do this show 25 times in a row. You can’t possibly leave with the same show you came with. So, all you really should be worried about is your first show of the run, which will be a preview anyway. So don’t feel too much pressure to arrive with something perfect; you’ll get there.
Spend less time worrying and more time writing and performing. Doing your first hour isn’t a big a deal as you think it is, and just as you’ve got a essentially no chance of taking this show to the festival and achieving life-changing fortune and industry adoration; you’re also probably unable to make any career-altering mistakes either.
But stop having self doubt.
First, even though it’s an open access festival, Edinburgh has just enough gatekeepers that with only very few exceptions, you’re unlikely to have been given a room at the festival if at least somebody who has some professional and reputational skin in the game didn’t think you’d be able to do it. There’s no inside and outside in comedy. Or, at least to the extent to which there is: you’re in!
Second, there is a reason why lots of people who have done perfectly well received hours at the festivals are unable to get themselves booked to do club 20s at the weekend stand-up clubs. It’s possible to entertain people for an hour in the context of a festival show without too much of a skillset. If you’re reading this thinking, “but I do have a skillset — I’m good at comedy!” then stop thinking that you can’t do an hour. You absolutely can.
Obviously do whatever you want, but I think there are two approaches, and having tried both, I don’t think it matters which you choose.
The first is to settle on a story, theme, or message first. For my first hour ‘Pig in Japan’, I wanted to tell the story of becoming a minor TV personality in Japan, and the bad experience I had on set that made me decide to quit. I already had the videos I wanted to play, and I vaguely knew how I wanted the audience to feel.
Once I had the north star, I then went about adding routines to see if any of them helped me with the narrative I wanted to write. Each preview I did I hot-swapped routines that I’d either done before, or had written especially, to see if I could hit a certain point or beat that the show needed.
For example, I knew that I wanted to make the point in the show that generally life in Japan as a non-Japanese person is abrasive and challenging, before I made the point that the TV industry takes this to a ridiculous level. I could make that point in a number of ways. In the end I settled on a routine about buying fried chicken, but it could have been anything.
So that’s the first way: think of the story that you want to tell, then write routines and jokes in support of that end goal.
The second way is the opposite of this — think of your hour as five ten-minute routines, and find a way to make those five bits flow.
The advantage of this method is you probably have three or four ten-minute routines that you’re proud of, and you know work well. Your job during previews is to stitch them together. Try doing both routines as a twenty minute set, and see if you can merge the two, creating an A-plot and B-plot, adding callbacks, and merging your world creation. Try taking lines and tags from one routine and wedging them into another that works by making a tangent, or a simile, or comparison.
Do the show enough and you’ll realise that there is a narrative through line that just exists by virtue of the fact that it’s you who wrote the routines, and you would have had your own subconscious motivations to write them in the first place; it’s likely that many of your routines betray a unique and interesting principle or heuristic that’s obvious to you, but potentially interesting to your audience.
Once you’ve settled on your roughly fifty minutes of material (I say this because you want your show to run about 55 minutes, and the best way to do that is to have fifty fantastic minutes that you perform with enough poise and credibility that the material has space to breathe), it’s time to work out what the show actually is.
One way to approach this is to ask yourself “how would I like my audience to recommend my show to a friend?” A less cynical way of thinking about this exact same question is to appreciate that the audience won’t remember any of your material, but they will remember how they felt after the performance. What do you want that feeling to be? Critically examine every routine and work out whether it’s in service of this goal. If it isn’t — get rid.
A good way to stress test routines is to take them back into clubs and open mics. Even while previewing a show I’ll book in as many new material nights as I can, and see if I can perform the routines I’ve written out of the context of the show. It’s a quick way to find out if the premises are independently enjoyable and intriguing.
If you’ve booked in enough previews, and you get the sense that the iterative leaps from one preview to the next are getting smaller and smaller, then do some radical things to shake things up. Start with your closing routine and see what happens. Start bending the truth to see if it makes for a better story (consider changing chronologies, merging characters (i.e. if you talk about Mr. A in one routine and Mr. B in another, just make them the same person), raising the stakes, etc). No doubt you’ll be audio recording all your performances, but take a video camera too and see how your physicality can be improved.
Don’t do a census at the start of the show. Where they came from, who they came with, and their professions don’t matter one dot. Don’t get all meta and talk about the process of writing the show or “so this is my first hour, and I wanted to talk to you about…”. Just thank them for coming and start with a really funny routine.
This is a joke, but the reason that the ‘dead dad show’, and its tell-tale structure of having a sad bit happen two thirds in is because you need to pace your show while thinking about your audience’s energy and attention levels. Even if they weren’t watching four other shows either side of yours, your audience won’t want you to perform with the same energy for the duration of the show. Start to feel and intuit the moments where you pull back, recalibrate, and go for another round. Like having sex, I presume.
I made this mistake with my first hour, until a reviewer pointed it out. In the last ten minutes of the show, the story I was telling felt like it was concluding, but I went off on a little tangent because I had a nice handful of jokes that I wanted top put somewhere, and they sort of fitted. The show didn’t need it, and was better when I just cut it. If you’re on the home straight, don’t deviate.
If you’re listening back to a recording and more than 20–30 seconds has passed without the audience laughing, then you should re-write. If you need to let the audience know that your mum is old for the sake of a routine about age differences, don’t just say “My mum is old — she’s 87. She’s the same age as my friend’s grandparents, which means…”. Instead, try turning that premise into a joke. “My mum is old. She’s of the generation that put decorative plates on the walls, like your grandparent’s parents did.” there we have the premise, plus character exposition, and a laugh.
This is a hard one to explain, and is something I’ve only recently started doing, so maybe it’s too much to ask for a first fringe hour, but vibe up there. Don’t feel the need to do precisely the same show every day. Be playful and responsive and reactive. It’s not the end of the world if Thursday’s audience gets a slightly different show to Friday’s audience because you had an intrusive thought that you shared with the crowd (with we can only presume hilarious consequences). Be present, and let your persona and personality drive the show. You’re not presenting your material; you’ve written your material to present you.
If you’re doing a free or pay what you want show, consider doing your bucket speech before your final routine not after so people aren’t listening to you doing admin and thinking about needing a wee and how far they are away from their next show etc while you’re doing the important job of getting them to pay for the show they just watched for free.
No matter how silly, ironic, subversive or cynical your on stage persona is, don’t be anything other than sincere and authentic for the bucket speech. Explain the recommended cost for the show, then invite the audience to “pay for the show”. Not donate to the show, or contribute to your expenses, or whatever other work-devaluing apology you may have.
Be brutal about cutting stuff. Even if it’s brilliant. It won’t be wasted effort, you’ll find a use for it some day.
Once you’re fairly sure you’ve got a show, then treat every single performance as a fresh start. Just like rolling a dice, the chances of you hitting a six today are entirely independent to what you achieved yesterday. Don’t worry if you forgot a bit, did an act out wrong, messed up a few lines. The audience have absolutely no idea what they’re supposed to be seeing, so have no way of knowing if today was a ‘good one’ or not.
Just take your job as custodians of their happiness for an hour seriously, and you’ll do great.
The final—and probably most important—thing to remember is there literally are no rules in Edinburgh. If you’ve read any part of this and thought “oh well I cant’ do that then” then just ignore whatever made you think that.
All that matters is your audience. Care deeply about them, over-deliver on whatever promise you’ve made to them, and do the festival on your own terms.

Usually I try to write a snappy intro, but I’ve a bit of a headache and honestly the headline and deck have all the basics. Let’s get into it.

Tucked around the corner from Wembley Stadium is a more quirky arena: the setting for Enitan’s Game, a kid-friendly hour-long experience for Punchdrunkards (and other immersive enthusiasts) and their children. Telling the story of a family’s tradition of community play, visitors are quickly swept up in the frenzy of joining in one more round of the game invented by Enitan’s grandfather before his life celebration takes place.
I attend one of the standard sessions where children are expected, so while the kids take the lion’s share of participation and I don’t have much to do myself I’m still charmed and enthralled by the standard Punchdrunk-quality bells and whistles: the endearing pack-rat-yet-curated style of set design with light, sound, and haze all are there in the expert quality of execution we’ve come to expect. There’s a few surprising special effects: a Jumanji moment bewitches the group and elicits a few gasps from both generations, and there are one or two spooky moments that coast the edge between adolescence and mature thrills. I do have a couple calls to action but generally the grown-ups are there to watch the joy and wonder on the kids’ faces and to listen to the endearing story told by the two actors. There are adults-only sessions which welcome guests with a cocktail and close with a Q&A with members of the cast & creative team, but I’m assured by the host that the show runs exactly the same for both age groups; no changes to plot or acting style is made.
It’s prudent to note here that Punchdrunk Enrichment is a sister & separate company of Punchdrunk, and therefore while they share some fundamental members and elemental values they are not the same. Punchdrunk Enrichment’s design emphasis appears to be placed on gameplay and narrative, rather than the aesthetic and mature tones adult audiences have come to expect from sister company Punchdrunk; this is consistent with P.E.’s goal of creating experiences for education, community, and family audiences. Visitors would be wise to note this if planning a visit.
We’re all in favor of early indoctrination of the next generation of immersive enthusiasts & creators, and what better way than to pivot one of the biggest names in the game to get hold of ‘em early? Bring the kids (or borrow some) and start the journey together; Enitan’s Game is an ace in the hole.

Generative Artificial Intelligence. If it’s not telling you that adding glue will help the cheese stay on your pizza, it is producing art of eight fingered children or smoking monkeys.
Some people say it’s the future. Those people are wrong. The phrase “I asked ChatGPT where to buy a stamp” floats into my mind during quiet moments.
I tried to give ’The Waiting Room’ a chance. It’s Edinburgh Fringe. I want to experience experiments and risk taking. Creatives trying and sometimes failing. It’s so vital for immersive pieces to be developed and able to react and grow in response to audiences. But this is clinical. Cold. Am I supposed to be charmed that the robot can say my name?
There are previous AI based works I have enjoyed.“Saint Jude”, by Swamp Motel, made a delightful mix of interactive performance and communication with an artificial intelligence.
The show starts late. We hadn’t received the information we needed to bring headphones and smart phones. Then we can’t connect to the Internet in the venue. The AI generates stories slowly and the audience’s audio stories fall out of sync with each other. Being called up to get a note with a new task is not in sync with the AI telling us what to do.
We are in a Waiting Room to sell our digital avatar for use in adverts and political messages. Tasks are handed to us by a performer, wearing a paper mask for no explainable reason. “Write on the sticky note”, “take a selfie”. The AI has generated 24 mins of audio and “personal stories” based on my prompts.
Our audience is nervous, quiet. Long periods of silence.The performers seem unsure how to encourage us to interact. “Pick up a toy from a box and dance”. Why? What do I get out of this?
The purpose of a system is what it does. Immersive is beautiful in unique moments. This show isn’t a satirical look at a new form of art generation.
To paraphrase “I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.”
In the end the AI stated that my desire to be a marine biologist and my selling of beard oil made a “salty liquid for the face”.
Well.
Quite.

(It is worth noting that No Proscenium reviewed the online version of this work last year. But this was a chance to be in a real life space alongside the performers and live audience.)
Entering the hotel’s hall, containing a giant screen in the centre of the space, we are presented with a musician, to the side of a stage. This is ‘Non-Player Character’, a live musical taking place in virtual reality.
Performer and creator, Brendan Bradley (who played all the characters as well as singing throughout), welcomes us all and explains that, since the other company of performers hadn’t turned up, it was a chance to let our audience be involved in the show. I took the opportunity, so I am reporting my experience as a participant rather than an audience spectator.
Wearing Oculus headsets, I and three other audience members take on the avatars of colourful rock monsters. We have no legs and have blocky hands and faces. A giant grey being appears and mocks us for not doing anything. This is the Hero. He sings about how he is going to save the day, so we should watch. Then he is killed, leaving us alone with the Non Player Character. NPC falls into a deep depression now his friend is dead and we need to help him heal over the course of the musical.
A lot of the choices are made by the audience voting for the routes characters take as well as placing items into the space to interact with.
The VR, on the whole, held up. The NPC travels around the space and the songs echoed around us. NPC would ask questions and did a good job of handling the responses. A highlight was the green player who kept trying to get as close to NPC as possible.
Sometimes, it did just feel we were being dragged along by the narrative as we travelled from scene to scene. Sometimes we did the video game time fillers of trying to get stuck in holes, throwing rocks or just waving at each other. Which was quite wholesome.
Shows about grieving have become a common theme in this year’s Fringe. This was a wholesome and touching musical with impressive graphics and well performed live music and lyrics. For me, it was heightened by being able to participate in the action.

In the heart of Scotland, Edinburgh and Glasgow stand as contrasting siblings, each exuding their own brand of charisma. These cities are not just destinations; they are experiences, embroidered with history and buzzing with modern life.
Edinburgh — A Timeless Elegance Amidst a Dynamic Rhythm
Edinburgh, the capital, is a city of literary dreams and cobbled whispers. As you wander through its ancient lanes, the city feels like an open-air museum, each street a gallery, each building a testament to the past. The iconic Edinburgh Castle looms over the city like a guardian of history, while the Royal Mile stretches below, a procession route of heritage and tradition.
Yet, Edinburgh pulses with a youthful beat. The city’s historic heart flutters with the hustle of street performers, the clink of coffee cups, and the intellectual buzz of university life. There’s a juxtaposition here — the old-world charm of the Old Town, where every alleyway tells a story, against the New Town’s neoclassical grace, alive with chic boutiques and modern gastronomy.

Although my ancestry comes from Scotland, it was never that high on my travel list.
I’m not sure why — I guess other locations just sounded more exciting. So when my dad planned a trip for our family to explore Scotland, it sounded fun, but not like a place to cross off my bucket list.
That all changed when I got to the country.
Scotland was amazing; truly a place I could see myself living someday. I was shocked by how much I loved it — the people, the city, the country, the food, the atmosphere, everything.
We went all over, starting in Glasgow. That beautiful gothic city was quite the introduction to the country, but once we hopped on the train to head to our next destination, the Isle of Eriska on the western coast, we started to really see the beauty Scotland has to offer.
The Isle of Eriska was its own private island, complete with a unique, castle-style hotel, activities, and a spot to watch otters playing in the ocean at sunrise.
It was magical.
The rest of the trip was just as exciting, with multiple castle ruin tours, spending time on Loch Ness looking for the…

Photography Walks: Edinburgh, Scotland
Walk Two: A Picturebook of a Short Stay in Scotland’s capital
It started out as a treat for our 12 year old daughter. She wanted to see the pandas in Edinburgh Zoo which is 245 miles (395K) away! A fresh urgency to fulfilling this request was the forthcoming removal of the pandas back to China.
We decided that a couple of nights stay was required and set off early on day one. The delights of an Air B+B awaited us. We are non-smokers and chose a non-smoking flat. The previous visitors clearly had no regard for this and the flat stank. And in the second bedroom the broken blind was hidden in the wardrobe. Grrrr. Open windows, emergency window coverings, copious amounts of air freshener and complaints to the owner. Well, we’ll never stay there again! Air B+B has served us well over the years but not this time.
As well as the zoo and pandas our daughter’s idea of a good time is shopping for clothes. So after the zoo mum and daughter went shopping and I took the opportunity to wander with my camera and catch up with them here and there.
One thing we did together was to visit the Royal Yacht Britannia which is now a tourist attraction on Edinburgh’s docks. Retired…

I stood shivering next to the sea at Wardie Bay, a huge grin plastered across my face. I had just done my first ever cold dip. My husband was looking at me bemused, surprised I had actually done it (we both know I’m more of a cup-of-tea-on-the-sofa type). I felt emotional, thinking about all the life we had squeezed into the past year and aware that our time in Edinburgh was coming to an end.
In April 2024 I moved from London to Edinburgh and now, just a little over a year later, I have moved back.
When I told people about this move their first question would often be ‘have you moved for work?’ To which I would reply ‘no, I moved for fun and work moved with me!’ Relocating to Edinburgh wasn’t driven by a job offer and it wasn’t a strategic career move. It was a move led by life.
Our tenancy agreement in London was coming to an end, we weren’t quite ready to buy and when it came to thinking about where to rent next I floated a question: ‘shall we leave London?’
We toyed with some more exotic options, but settled on the land of the deep fried mars bar and tattie scone. This was partly because I had visited Edinburgh before and always felt at home in the city. But it was also partly practical: it’s English-speaking, there was much more likelihood of us keeping our jobs, it’s not too far and it’s low risk because as a tenant you can hand in your notice and leave within 28-days (yes, really… Scotland does things better).
Both Jason (the husband) and I got the move signed off by work, bundled our possessions into the car and journeyed north.
Although lots of people have been delighted by our move, some have been a bit perplexed. Aside from the fact that we chose Scotland (why not Lisbon or Paris or somewhere… sunny?), and the fact we made the move knowing it would be temporary (why go to all that effort?), there was a third oddity tugging at people’s minds: why did we move if it wasn’t for work?
I find that last reaction particularly interesting, as it hints at a wider cultural phenomenon. Today, a large part of our identity is tied up in what we do for a living. Even that phrase ‘for a living’ doesn’t really make sense anymore — do we really just work for a living? Or do we work for a sense of self, the desire for fulfilment and, in some cases, the drive to attain a certain social status?
There is, of course, a mounting counter-movement that is pushing back against the way work is swallowing our lives whole, for example the rise of the four-day work week, or the increase in remote-working — which is expected to grow 25% by 2030. Demand for jobs with flexibility is on the rise, suggesting that more of us want to fit work around life, rather than the other way around.
As someone who has pivoted their career to the social/ environmental impact sector, it would be quite ironic if I thought that working for a bigger purpose was a bad thing. Of course I don’t. But I do believe that you can be career-motivated in general, and still seek out life experiences that have nothing to do with job prospects and may, even, negatively impact your career, albeit temporarily.
The important point is that it’s not a zero-sum game, it’s a pendulum swing. Sometimes work leads, sometimes it’s adventure and sometimes other responsibilities will take the limelight. (Or at least that’s how I think it should be).
We rented a flat in New Town, working from there most days, occasionally taking our laptops to nearby coffee shops. My arrangement with work was that I would come down to London once a month and spend two days in the office (the typical policy is two days a week in office). When I was in London it was chaotic and jam-packed, but when I returned to Edinburgh it was quiet and much more spontaneous (thanks to few social obligations).
Overall though, I would do it again in a heartbeat.
Not everyone has the ability to up and move — whether due to work, medical needs or the reality of family life, so understandably this is a privileged position to be in.
If you are in a position to prioritise an adventure — however big or small — here are some tips:
My time in Edinburgh isn’t a footnote, it’s a full chapter in my book of life. I still care deeply about my work, especially when it comes to using my working life to make a positive difference (however small), but I also care about living with intention.
And if you’ve made it this far, maybe you’re ready to do the same.
Why not try…
There’s more where that came from, so if you’re planning a trip don’t be afraid to ask for recommendations!

I made a new friend by happenstance. Recently I accidentally destroyed an old, precious book of mine, and April Smith, owner of Booksmith Conservation, restores them for a living (beautifully, I might add). She also completed an archaeological dig at the Macedonia-Greece border in the 1990s (!!🤓) — one of the places I will expand my research to in the coming years. Plus, her job is so cool; I was friendly-jealous and mesmerized by the process of book preservation. She’s taking a trip to Scotland this summer, and I remembered that I have a list of spots and tips I curated a while back for friends visiting the Highlands and Edinburgh I haven’t shared here yet. I wrote this quickly, soon after my last trip there (pre-COVID), but I imagine many of the same general things still apply. So it’s a bit hodge-podge in style, structure, and content, but that’s because Scotland trips don’t really need to be planned — Scotland plans you.
Highlands Lodging:
One thing to keep in mind is that most bed and breakfasts in the Highlands are not yet online (weirdly) — so we thought Portree was all booked up before arriving, but you really can show up, and all the hundreds of B&Bs you pass will have either a “vacancy” sign or a “no vacancy” sign. It’s a nice system if you want to walk around a bit and meet the (very kind) owners, who are always willing to let you glance at the room and see if it’s charming enough to suit your needs before locking in the (very affordable) deal.
Basically, this is my way of saying don’t pre-book anything in the Highlands. Just follow your intuition and let yourself be guided by the lovely locals.
Highlands Info:
Oban is spectacular. It won’t be difficult, but be sure you catch the sunset there. It’s life changing. And if possible, have fish ‘n chips from a place that has fresh catches every day.
The Isle of Skye is also gorgeous —even if you have gray weather (like we did), it comes in spurts and doesn’t really rain that hard, so don’t let it keep you inside. Bring a billed rain jacket if you have one—it’s what everyone wears.
I don’t know where you’re planning to stay, but I strongly suggest having dinner in Portree at least once. There is such an impressive collection of high-end seafood restaurants concentrated there. We found a new one we recommend the highest — but I’m sure they are all good. There are several fish ‘n chips places, too — but I had the best fish ‘n chips I’ve ever had in the little take-it-to-go place in the center if Portree. You’ll notice it just by walking around for five minutes because Portree is small. They definitely have fresh fish every day, most often from only an hour ago. Add the salt and vinegar and order a side of any of the homemade sauces that you tend to like elsewhere (like tartar sauce or curry sauce).
If you want to do a tour of Talisker, you’ll have to book it in advance — our way of seeing the distilleries was actually to just go to the bar and order a flight. Talisker’s bar wasn’t finished yet, but if you’re interested in buying a bottle, they will give you a taste. Talisker is the famous one, though, so it's a bit touristy (still worth a stop!). I enjoyed the smaller distilleries better — they were friendlier and felt more Scottish.
In general, when driving, don’t be afraid to make unplanned stops along the way! We found several little hiking paths that were well-marked and let you choose via signposts “waterfall versus lair,” etc. all along the way. We also made an unplanned stop in the (very small) town of Sligachan on Skye where we could try any whisky our heart desired for very cheap. The town is basically a little rest stop close to Talisker, but worth spending some time in if you don’t get to do a tour of Talisker (we skipped it). In short, the Highlands are perfect for exploring.
I’m sure you will learn this when you arrive, but just to give you a taste of the mantra: “There are no trespassing laws in Scotland” — so you can literally walk anywhere, go through any gate, and explore wherever your heart desires. The farmers you meet encourage it — and seem to be proud of this aspect of Scotland. They will tell you if the bulls are out (and still, you can go through), but otherwise, they truly don’t mind you taking hikes through their incredible properties, which, together, make up Scotland. :)
Portree Restaurants:
I was told the best ones are №1 and Scorrybreac restaurants, but we didn’t book in advance, and in the summertime, they tend to be full, so we didn’t get to try them.
There are several restaurants nearby of a similar caliber, which we just walked past and begged for a reservation at dinner time (most were full).
We ended up trying Dulce and Brose with reservations one evening. It was overhyped but still tasty. We also tried another one by waiting in the bar area until they gave us a table — and it was so good that we added it to Google Maps and gave it its first 5-star review. It was seriously amazing. The name is Caroy House (it’s in cursive and super nondescript, so easy to miss, but worth finding!!). I recommend the smoked haddock risotto, the hake, the white wines they offer, and any of the desserts, really. It was spectacular. (Update from 2024: looks like it might be closed, thanks COVID).
Also, try the bakeries in Portree — and the little sandwich shops and savory pie places (anywhere, really, if you see a nice-looking pie).
EDINBURGH (EDI)
Italian:
1. For a very fancy night, you could try for a reservation at Locanda De Gusti (102 Dalry Rd). The food is top-notch homemade Italian; but it’s a small place so I’d guess that they are full already for the dates you’re there. Still worth a try!
2. For a very close second, make a reservation at a place Divino Enoteca (5 Merchant St). This place is large, so it almost always can fit you in for a same-night reservation, but it still has low, gorgeous lighting and punch-you-in-the-face, delicious food.
3. Finally, if you haven’t had a chance to try one of Jaimie Oliver’s restaurants elsewhere in the UK, it’s always a decent option. Jaimie’s Italian (54 George Street) is technically a chain, but it still serves pretty remarkable and creative Italian food. It’s a good lunch option if you’re staying nearby, but it's not worth trekking to.
Indian:
There is incredible Indian options all over Edinburgh, and I’m yet to try a bad one.. but these are the ones I’ve tried and would highly recommend. Regardless of whether you’re into spicy food or not, these places are a life experience:
1. Dishoom Edinburgh (3a St Andrew Square): This place started in London but has a few more now because of how perfect it is. Small plates, try-everything sort of style + delicious and seriously amazing cocktails. Matt and I decided to eat here twice in one week once, and I would have eaten there again. Tip — ask to eat downstairs if they will let you! The vibe of the bar seating is cooler (both metaphorically and literally) than the upstairs, which gets very hot in the summertime.
2. Tuk Tuk Indian Street Food: a hipster-style BYOB place that is quick, easy, and delicious.
3. Kamasutra Indo Tapas Restaurant (16 Drummond St) — this place is a little further out (and by further out, it’s like a 20 min. walk from George Street versus everything else), but that might turn out to be a good thing if other places are fully booked. It’s strikingly good and affordable too.
4. Ghurka Cafe (27 Cockburn St) is the first Indian place I discovered, so it has a very special place in my heart. I’ve taken every guest who visited me in Edi, and it was always a crowd pleaser. It’s a no frills kind of place (for instance, I think they only serve beer and average quality wine), but the flavors of the food are so good it will make you want to lick your plate clean (my not-so-new friend Mary’s son memorably did this). And it’s actually Nepalese so the dishes are really close to northern Indian dishes, very rich and pleasing. The location is super central and usually quite full, but somehow, they have always managed to fit me in without a reservation. (Still, make one if you can!)
Scottish:
1. Arcade Bar, Haggis & Whisky House (48 Cockburn St): This is a delicious lunch spot. For an easy entrance into the world of haggis, try the haggis nachos. If you are all-in, order the traditional style full plate haggis. Grab a dram of whisky here, too, if you’re feeling it — they have everything. The service is a little slow as they are often understaffed, but it’s such a pleasant atmosphere inside + perfect food that you won’t mind. :)
2. Fish n’ Chips: You’ll have plenty of opportunities for fresh fish n’ chips in the Highlands, so you might not want it in Edinburgh in lieu of other options, but if you do, my only advice is to get it from a small, low-key sort of place you notice somewhere that clearly gets fresh fish every day and not from a pub.
3. The Edinburgh Larder (15 Blackfriars St): simple but locally-sourced, delicious breakfast cafe/deli.
4. Oink (34 Victoria St): This place roasts an entire pig every day and makes these delicious (reasonably sized) sandwiches with various homemade toppings such as sweet potato mash, cranberry sauce, apple sauce, haggis, etc. It’s Matt’s favorite “snack” in Edinburgh.
5. Indigo Yard (7 Charlotte Ln): This place has delicious beers on tap and really impressive food. I guess it’s called a gastropub? The atmosphere is really nice — make a reservation if you can, and if you just show up, they might be able to squeeze you into the garden/bar area.
EDI Cocktails:
There is an underground cocktail place in Edinburgh called Panda & Sons — the outside looks like an old-style barber shop, but if the door’s not already open, just open it and go downstairs (Update: I later learned this is called a Speakeasy 😂) . I’ll let the rest be a surprise. It was recently rated in the top ten for good cocktails in Europe. Weekends can be really packed, but the cocktail will still be perfect every time, and the vibes are always great.
EDI Sweets:
Mary’s Milk Bar. I’m not big on sweets, and I initially thought I was just noticing this place because it has my name on it. But one day, I tried it, and now, I can confidently say it’s one of the few sweet places I would wait in line for — each flavor is a masterpiece! I saw only after I’d been that it made it onto Somebody Feed Phil’s Scotland episode. 💁‍♀️ (Thanks for recommending that show incidentally, sister Ellen!)
EDI Tourist spots:
1. The Castle: You can walk to see the entrance of the castle without paying the fee to get in ($18). It is worth it to go in if you have a free afternoon. It’s not a pop-in experience though. If you go, I would recommend touring half of it, taking a good long break in the cafe, and then touring the rest. There’s just so much to see; it’s all so remarkable; and it’s much more enjoyable at a leisurely pace.
2. Holyrood Palace: I’ve never been inside, but I have been told it is epic.
3. Royal Yacht Britannia: If you have an extra day, I would recommend this option highly. Especially if you are even vaguely swayed by the drama of the royal family (isn’t everyone when it gets right down to it?). If you’ve watched the Crown, book your tickets NOW. It is a big thing to get there if I remember correctly — I think we split a taxi?? — I don’t remember. But if you have the time, I definitely recommend it. If you’re days are limited, it’s not worth missing a day in EDI for though.
4. Calton Hill (at day or night) + graveyards + Arthur’s seat: This is my top recommendation for Edinburgh. Just put on some comfortable shoes and walk around Edinburgh.. follow windy stone streets.. especially the little alleys (which are called “closes”). Get lost. You’re allowed to follow any of the closes that catch your eye. Read about the history of closes if you’re interested. And if you think the history of closes is fascinating…
5. …take a guided tour of the famous, the real, Mary King’s Close. You’ll get the full history of the original design of the city and be able to see it underground, fully preserved from ancient times. (This is the only guided tour I’d recommend, but I’m not really that into guided tours.. I’m sure there are other great ones in Edinburgh, and probably even free ones with various themes.)
6. The Royal Mile: This could be absolutely packed with people in the summertime, so it may be hard to get perspective on the layout with the crowds, but it’s pretty remarkable to see nonetheless. Both amazing and average street performers congregate there, practicing for Fringe season, and there will be hundreds of free shows every day.
7. Live music will be abundant.
8. Grassmarket is a good neighborhood as well for seeing street performers and will be slightly less crowded than the touristy spots of EDI. I also like the Queen Street Gardens neighborhood. The museums close to Queen Street Gardens are both free and have a very impressive art collection.
9. Fringe: If you’re going in August, you will run into the chaos that is the Fringe Festival. Most people from EDI leave for the festival but if you brave it, but you should definitely get ahold of a Fringe magazine when you arrive, even just to see the enormity of the event. I find it pretty overwhelming, actually and ended up just choosing a few highly recommended shows — such as some of the acrobatic ones, comedy shows, burlesque, etc. and then leaving the rest of my time open for walking in and out of free shows. Basically, every single venue in Edinburgh will have a show of some sort. It’s fun for a day or two, but like Vegas, the feeling of awe wears off almost as quickly as it comes.
In general, I’d recommend visiting EDI literally any month besides August.
EDI Lodging:
I would suggest booking a place in EDI in advance — just to be sure you get to stay in a comfortable spot in the center.
My favorite place to stay is actually a hostel called Kickass Hostel. If you’re there with 2–3 people, ask to book a private room with a view of the castle. It’s really amazing — especially if you don’t mind a basic room and shared bathrooms (Update: I’m kind of past the point of sharing bathrooms). But either way, they have a comfy cafe where you can hang out and plan your EDI day.
Or not. Because plans, like the land, are made to be trespassed through in Scotland.

Final tips: take a few pics and write down some of the places you fall in love with unexpectedly (share with me) — and most of all, enjoy!

Edinburgh’s decline into a theme park has been charted for years, and the recent victory to Save the People’s Story stands out as an exception against a backdrop of relentless social cleansing, homelessness (the Scottish capital is home to the largest number of people living in temporary accommodation) and culture-washing.
The city’s problems are structural — it is a city of capital rather than a capital city. It’s purpose is hard-wired into its streets and architecture. As William McIlvanney writes in his novel Strange Loyalties, Edinburgh was:
“…built to be a Hanoverian clearing-house of the Scottish identity. The very street names declare what’s happening, like an announcement of government policy in stone: you have Princes Street and George Street and Queen Street with, in among them, Hanover Street and Rose Street and Thistle Street. Any way you count it, the result is the defeat of Scottishness. This was an identity superimposed on the capital of Scotland, an attempted psyche-transplant: ‘Scottishness may have been a life but Britishness can be a career.’
But if Edinburgh’s problems are historic, and symbolic, it is not helped by its current leadership. We know that Cammy Day was forced to resign from his job as leader of the Labour administration in the capital following allegations he had bombarded two Ukrainian refugees with multiple messages on social media. The councillor, who was suspended by his party last weekend, faces a police investigation into claims he acted “inappropriately”.

It is Friday, the beginning of May, my usual morning to write my blog and I’m sitting in a hotel room in Edinburgh, Scotland. The sky is blue and cloudless and the air is a crispy 47°F.
My usual routine back home is placing my computer on the dining room table, quieting my mind and giving thanks while my Doodle Abbey rests at my feet. Today, I sit on a comfy bed with pen and paper. I asked for divine guidance and inspiration.
In response, I hear, “ You are beautiful.”
One of my favorite songs is “ Beautiful” by Gordon Lightfoot, a tune and lyrics that touch my heart. “You are so beautiful. I was made for you and you were made for me.”
Imagine God/Source/our Creator saying to you, my brother Bob, Marilyn, Ann, Alena, Paulette, Michael….all of us “You are beautiful.” Tears fill my eyes and joy fills my heart. Hear the words…. “ I was made for you and you were made for me.”
We are all the same energy made for each other, across continents across lifetimes and realities.
Hold that, feel it. Don’t let anything else in. You, your essence, your light, you, you are beautiful.
How does it feel to walk through your days as “ I am beautiful” versus “I am human, I am flawed, I have issues, blah, blah, blah.”
Try it, now, today, all day, all month. For the month of May, tell yourself I am beautiful.
Look for beauty, everywhere, every day in this month of May and write it down.
“Through rain or shine for such a long time. I’m telling you, you are beautiful.”
You’ve been beautiful since the day you were born and before.
It would mean so much to me if you would experience this. If you would close your eyes, take a deep breath, listen carefully and feel the powerful love given to you by three words “You are beautiful .”
With a smile on my face and joy in my heart, I am off to explore Edinburgh. Enjoy your Friday. Happy May!!

One of the most striking features of Edinburgh is its weather, especially during the autumn and rain season. The misty rain often adds a sense of mystery to the old town, enhancing its fantasy-like appeal. Autumn in Edinburgh brings a palette of rich golds, browns, and reds, with the crisp air carrying the scent of fallen leaves and wet earth. The city’s vintage buildings…

Update: the Principal Edinburgh Charlotte Square hotel is now the Kimpton Charlotte Square. Read the new review here.
With a castle view, a garden room indoors, and a gentleman’s travel collection on display, The Principal Edinburgh Charlotte Square is simply the most remarkable place to stay in New Town.
I blew into the hotel on a gusty early evening unprepared to be immediately charmed by this hotel. But charmed I was. The outside is grand while staying coyly understated. The Principal inhabits seven gorgeous Georgian townhouses and has been fastidiously refurbished with both expected and unexpected details.
Although I loved the masculine entry hall, I was distracted by the restaurant during check-in. Previously an outdoor courtyard, it is now an indoor garden room with a glass ceiling reminiscent of an atrium, draped in hanging ferns and styled with garden furniture. My husband and I enjoyed a full breakfast here both mornings of our stay and noticed happy chatting groups when we came in late in the evening. Another restaurant with a completely different vibe is tucked away at one end of the hotel. BABA serves food with an Eastern Mediterranean flair sprinkled with local staples, such as Scottish beef. At a contrast to The Garden, BABA is dipped in deep greens, reclaimed wood and wool rugs. Its moody evening feel is exciting, even before you see a menu.
Our tour of the room included a story — how Scottish! If The Principal was a person, he’d be Hamish, a gentleman with fine tastes who travels the world looking for the best of it. He’s collected books, textiles and trinkets which he displays on shelves for the pleasure of his guests. Just like the front desk staff, I picture Hamish as friendly and warm — as welcoming as this hotel.
As this was my first time staying at The Principal family of hotels, I was delighted with the complimentary sweets and savory snacks in the tuck box. The red corded telephone by the bedside was adorable as well, adding to the eclectic mix of old and new that works so flawlessly here. I was delighted to see that books are available to borrow from the front desk and hot tea is as easy to find as whisky. Some rooms have the best view in the country, a view of Edinburgh Castle. Even knowing this before I arrived, it was still breathtaking.
If you only have one day in this beguiling city, do these three things within walking distance of the hotel:
1. Visit the most besieged fortress in Great Britain, Edinburgh Castle. Try the Millionaire Shortbread in the café.
2. Tour the homes (now underground) of the average citizen during the time of the plague. I recommend The Real Mary King’s Close Underground Tour.
3. Eat at The Elephant House to absorb the ambience of the place where J.K. Rowling wrote much of the first Harry Potter book.
There’s only one place to stay in Edinburgh with such abundant charms and comforts, The Principal Edinburgh Charlotte Square. My thanks to Simon Willis and Tara D’Agostino for their kind assistance with this story.

Liberal Arts Blog — Sunday is the Joy of Humor, Food, Travel, Practical Life Tips, and Miscellaneous Day
Today’s Topic: Scotland (Part One) A Little Geography, Five Battles, Edinburgh (including the Castle and the Fringe)
Last time, the fourth and final part of a series on the counties of Ireland. Today, on to Scotland, but first a re-cap.
On 2/23 we covered the Dublin of James Joyce and Leopold Bloom, Trinity College, the Ha’penny, Samuel Beckett, and O’Connell bridges, and St. Stephen’s Green, On 2/16 we investigated Northern Ireland including Belfast, the “Peace Walls,” the “Giant’s Causway” and Finn McCool. On 2/9, the central west (Galway, Mayo, Sligo) featuring the Aran jumper, Boycott, and Yeats. On 2/2 the southwest (Cork, Kerry, and Clare) and the stories of Daniel O’Connell (the emancipator of Catholics) and Michael Collins (independence leader who fought in the Easter Rebellion and was assassinated in an ambush at age 31 in 1922).
Now — the land of lochs and firths, of highlands, lowlands, and uplands, of the Shetlands, the Orkneys, and the inner and outer Hebrides, of Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen, of Robert Burns, William
Wallace, James Watt, James Clark Maxwell, Adam Smith, and Andrew Carnegie. And of the great clans — the MacKenzies, the Campbells, the Macleods, Stewarts, Douglases, Sinclairs, Macleans , Wallaces, MacGregors, Fergusons, and Gordons.
Are you Scottish? Have you been? Have you studied or lived there? What do you know about the northern third of island of Great Britain that the rest of us might not but would delight to learn?
Experts — please chime in. Correct, elaborate, elucidate.
GEOGRAPHY AND DEMOGRAPHY — note that firths are coastal inlets (like fjords) and lochs are lakes as in the famous story of the Loch Ness monster and the love song “Loch Lomond”
1. Scotland accounts for roughly a third of the island of Great Britain but has a population of only 5.5 million or about 8% of the United Kingdom. England: 56 million, Wales 3.2 million, Northern Ireland 1.9 million.
2. The border with England is only 92 miles long — as compared to its coastline of 6160 miles.
3. The North Channel separating Scotland from Northern Ireland is only 13 miles wide between the Mull of Kintyre in Scotland and Torr Head in Northern Ireland.
NB: 80% of Scotlands population is in the central lowlands which includes Glasgow (1 million) Edinburgh (half a million), Dunferline, Stirling, Perth, and Dundee.
FIVE HISTORIC BATTLES — Stirling Bridge (1297) Bannockburn (1314), Falkirk (1298), Folloden (1513), Culloden (1746)
1. Stirling Bridge (1297) William Wallace (1270–1305) and Andrew Moray (1265–1297) defeat English. Moray died of wounds from the battle. Wallace was later hanged, drawn, and quartered. Mel Gibson played Wallace in the film “Braveheart” (1995)
2. Bannockburn (1314) Robert Bruce defeats English leading ultimately to Scottish independence in 1328.
3. English victories against the Scots included: Falkirk (1298) Folloden (1513), and Culloden (1746).
The last English monarch to be killed in battle was James IV at the battle of Folloden. The Battle of Culloden ended the Jacobite rebellion which attempted to restore the Stuart monarchy. It was the last pitched battle on British land and resulted in mass evictions from ancestral lands, the banning of the tartan, and the disarming of the people.
EDINBURGH — THE CITY WITH A VOLCANIC PLUG IN THE MIDDLE UPON WHICH STANDS A CASTLE AND LEADING UP TO IT “THE ROYAL MILE” THROUGH THE “OLD TOWN” — have you been to the Edinburgh Fringe?
1. Edinburgh is bounded to the north side by the Firth of Forth and to the south side by the Pentland Hills.
2. “Recognized as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is the seat of the Scottish Government, the Scottish Parliament, the highest courts in Scotland, and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official residence of the monarch in Scotland.”
3. “The city has long been a centre of education, particularly in the fields of medicine, Scottish law, literature, philosophy, the sciences and engineering. The University of Edinburgh, founded in 1582 and now one of three in the city, is considered one of the best research institutions in the world. The financial center of Scotland, Edinburgh is the second-largest financial centre in the United Kingdom, the fourth largest in Europe, and the thirteenth largest internationally.”
NB: The Edinburgh Fringe is the “world’s largest performance arts festival which in 2024 spanned 25 days, sold more than 2.6 million tickets and featured more than 51, 446 scheduled performances of 3,746 different shows across 262 venues from 60 different countries. Of those shows, the largest section was comedy, representing 40% of shows, followed by theater, which was 26.6% of shows.” (see below)

Many years ago, I became the proud supervisor of not one, not two, but THREE PhD students and a part-time research assistant. Hurray me — I had a lab!
Now, clearly the word “lab” conjures images of test tubes and centrifuges, pipettes and petri dishes. Our research group has none of these things. But over time, the group of people associated with a given principal investigator (like me) and their shared resources (in our case, bubble guns and laptops rather than beakers and lab coats) has come to be known as a lab in a lot of scientific disciplines.
For us, the concept of the lab means a group of people who take an interest in each other’s work, help each other out when we’re stuck, and share ideas, resources and office space. We have a Code of Conduct to help set clear expectations for members of the group, and meet monthly to swap our latest news. Twice a year we have a half-day away day, sometimes focused on professional development and sometimes on just hanging out and having fun. Last autumn we had a session on writing a thesis and preparing for viva, but the most recent one included a foraging walk and then board games in a cafe!
My first challenge when deciding that my little team qualified as a lab group, was to come up with a name. I went to the pub with my husband and wrote down a series of keywords that described the work we were doing, and then saw which of these could be combined into a satisfactory and pronounceable acronym. And lo! DART was born — standing for development, autism, research, technology. Of course, I could have gone down the well-trodden path of the “Fletcher-Watson Lab” but honestly… *shudders*
Fast forward almost a decade and DART no longer seems like a suitable name for our little gang. “Research” has always bothered me as a keyword — I mean, obviously, we are researchers. “Autism” feels too narrow for what we do nowadays, which has a much broader focus on developmental diversity and trying to do work which is relevant and useful for multiple diagnosed and undiagnosed people. And it’s been a few years since I last did a project I could call “technology”.
So back to the drawing board, but roughly the same technique… Collectively we suggested words and — in a stroke of luck — this time we managed to organise them into an acronym that works for our largely-psychological research: MIND for mental health, interaction, neurodiversity, development. MIND though — there’s an awful lot of organisations out there with MIND as a name. That didn’t seem a good idea on its own, so Edinburgh MIND then?? Or maybe, there’s a chance to be clever and insert one more keyword into it all…
And so, the Edinburgh Inclusive MIND lab it is, or EdInMIND for short.
Nowadays this group has a rolling cast of about 10–16 members, as grant funding waxes and wanes. It is co-led by me and my close colleague, Catherine Crompton. While Catherine and I are both part of the Salvesen Mindroom Research Centre, our lab group is diverse and spans multiple parts of the University of Edinburgh — members may have a primary affiliation in the Division of Psychiatry, School of Philosophy Psychology and Language Sciences, Child Life and Health, Centre for Reproductive Health or Moray House School of Education and Sport. This diversity of perspective is one reason why we feel it’s important to have a lab identity which reflects our shared focus.
If you want to find out more about what we’re up to, the best gateway will be on this page where we link out to more specific projects and information — and back here, if you fancy going in a circle!

Our dead are never dead to us until we have forgotten them — George Eliot.
In the dark corners of the burial grounds of early 19th Century Edinburgh, the Necropolis of the North as I like to call it, two entrepreneurial men met a rapidly rising demand for human bodies to be used for anatomical dissection. Using human remains for medical research was illegal in the UK and banned in much of Europe or extremely limited for what were largely religious reasons.
To that end and to practice their surgical skills and enhance their anatomical knowledge doctors were only allowed to dissect bodies of executed criminals, people deceased in prison and oddly, orphans or people who had died with no fixed abode. As medical schools became more common, the supply and demand for dead bodies exceeded a state of economic equilibrium and so people resorted to body snatching or when that resource dried up, murder — to keep the cold medical school mortuary shelves and marble slabs well stocked.
Step forward William Burke and William Hare!
At the time Edinburgh was the leading European city for anatomical research and so the aptly named ‘resurrection men’ robbed fresh graves of their homo sapiens contents until relatives decided to take matters into their own hands and essentially lock the grave and coffin shut using what were termed ‘mort-safes’ of which some fine examples still exist in the infamous Greyfriars Kirkyard and others. These enclosed the grave, tomb or mausoleum in heavy duty wrought iron bars and locks, that even todays gangs that run around London with battery powered angle grinders to steal expensive bikes would struggle to cut open. The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh is still famed the world over as a leading surgical training today but by physically locking up the dead within their individual burial chamber, the supply of corpses rapidly dried up.
Out of interest, Surgeons’ Hall in Edinburgh, is the headquarters of the aforementioned Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and houses the Surgeons’ Hall Museum with anatomical displays and surgical equipment which is well worth a visit when you’re in town. There is also a library and archive of the colleges work.
The present Surgeons’ Hall was designed by Edinburgh’s leading light architect William Henry Playfair and completed in 1832, and is a category A listed structure while Playfair will feature in my tales of Edinburgh graveyards shortly and so please don’t change channels just yet!
The museum is recognised as a collection of national significance by the Scottish Government and very popular with tourists and locals alike.
Measures to ensure graves were left undisturbed, such as the use of mort-safes (I did research deadlock and mortice lock for this piece but there is no evidence that the etymological beginning of these names are at all linked to the subject matter but they sound like they should be) only made the shortage of cadavers even worse and so the indigenous vagrant population quickly became lambs to the slaughter and all for a princely sum of around £7 which would be worth around £1,000 today and so not to be ‘sniffed’ at.
When the New Calton Burial Ground was built as an overspill and operational replacement to the Old Calton Burial Ground just half a mile to its east on Regent Road due to Waterloo Place being built, a special watchtower was built, specifically to stop people grave robbing, such was the commercial opportunity on offer!
The murders started after a tenant in one of Hare’s properties died suddenly and the pair sold the body to Dr Robert Knox who was a celebrated lecturer of anatomy and a zoologist, ethnologist and medical doctor in the city and who had established the above-mentioned museum of anatomy and pathology. Another lodger, suffering from a cold was killed for literally sniffing too much and putting off other potential tenants from renting rooms and so the murders continued with the tacit approval of Burkes wife and Hare’s partner and no doubt partly to support their increasingly extravagant and expensive lifestyle. They were caught when the body of Margaret Docherty was discovered who was suspected to have been suffocated but at that time, no one could prove this.
Hare was granted immunity from prosecution and so by way of the use of Kings evidence he provided the details of Docherty’s murder and confessed to all sixteen deaths colloquially known then as the West Port Murders while charges were laid against Burke and his wife for three of the deaths.
At trial Burke was found guilty of just one murder and sentenced to death. The case against his wife was found not proven. Burke was hanged shortly afterwards and his cadaver was dissected and his skeleton displayed at the anatomical museum of the Edinburgh Medical School.
Robert Knox was never charged with his connection to the murders despite public outcry but his reputation in Edinburgh was irreparably damaged and so in time the Royal College of Surgeons forced him to resign as the curator of their anatomical museum.
The Burke and Hare case hugely raised public awareness of the need for cadavers for medical research and contributed to the passing of the Anatomy Act of 1832 that gave surgeons and students legal access to bodies from workhouses, hospitals and prisons that were unclaimed 48 hours after death. It was also made possible for a person to donate a next of kin’s body for medical research. It was essentially ratified in response to public outrage at the illegal trade in corpses.
The Arthur’s Seat 17 small coffins discovery
Robert Louis Stevenson died in 1894 and is buried on Mount Vaea, its summit overlooking Apia, the capital of Samoa. Many years before he died, he composed his own epitaph — ‘Under the wide and starry sky, Dig the grave and let me lie. Glad did I live and gladly die, and I laid me down with a will’.
Stevenson, as we know was a world-renowned Scottish novelist and is best known for Treasure Island, The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Kidnapped among many other books, poems, essays and travel guides. The son of Thomas Stevenson and grandson of Robert, a family famed for building lighthouses and other civil engineering feats suggested that he acquired his love of writing from his mother’s side of the family, the Balfours. His alma mater was Edinburgh University and while his paternal family were reticent about him taking on a life as a wordsmith and not an engineer, the rest as they say is history aside from the equally ‘strange case’ of 17 tiny coffins.
In June 1836, a group of boys were rabbiting on Arthur’s Seat, when they came across a small cave on the North East side, its entry covered by a stone and inside they found 17 miniature wooden coffins along with some tiny, carved figures clothed in delicate but bespoke outfits. These are now on show at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.
It has been mooted many times that these coffins are in some way a memorial to the 16 victims of Burke and Hare and as Burke was hanged in 1829 that made 17 deaths and indeed 17 coffins, others suggest they’re linked to some form of witchcraft.
However, in 2014, the museum was sent a package containing another small coffin with a small body with an accompanying note containing a long quote from Robert Louis Stevenson’s work — The Body Snatchers, which was part inspired by the Burke and Hare murders. Spooky indeed!
Greyfriars Bobby and the ghostly kirkyard.
There is no doubt that the most ‘popular’ graveyard in the Auld Reekie is at Greyfriars Kirk and probably because of a certain pet dog and not a famous human being although being what some term ‘the most haunted place in Edinburgh’ does get the tourists flooding in and it’s all for free as our all the main galleries and museums in this great, but increasingly ‘Disneyfied’ city.
The existing church on the site was built in 1602, and people have been buried here before then, including James Hutton, who famously stated that ‘we find no vestige of a beginning — no prospect of an ending’ and was part of Edinburgh’s period of ‘Enlightenment’. He realised that the earth was far older than current religious beliefs of the time allowed for and spoke out about this despite having to defer to the status quo and John Porteous, who was the drill master of Edinburgh’s city guard. When an infamous smuggler was hung in 1736, people rioted and he was given an order to shoot over them but as things worsened, he asked the soldiers to fire on the mob, killing many. He was charged, imprisoned at the Tollbooth, captured by the angry throng and then lynched, ending up buried at Greyfriars a day later. You can read more about this in my blog that features ‘Heart of Midlothian’ by Walter Scott which features this historic event and local football team the Jam Tarts and also my boyhood heroes Spurs.
From Waverley to White Hart Lane:
https://medium.com/@DuncanHynd/from-waverley-to-white-hart-lane-d083327faa2b
Rumour has it that it could be the most haunted graveyard in the world and is named after a Franciscan Friary located on the site but no longer stands there and aside from the above famous people interred also contains the burial places of some grave robbers too.
One angry, even violent apparition that has been allegedly seen and heard by late night revellers, legend has it is a certain George MacKenzie who was a tormentor of a religious group of 17th-century Presbyterians. Apparently, his ghostly form was freed when a tramp broke into his tomb and he has been on the rampage ever since.
Another often mentioned Greyfriars spectre is that of Edinburgh surgeon James Borthwick who died in 1675 and who bizarrely by today’s standards was the initial teacher of anatomy in a special society of barbers and surgeons! I guess this makes sense as both used sharp instruments to either shave people or operate on them or both if they wanted them dead and likely where the name cut throat razor came from!
A member of the Scottish Parliament, Borthwick was responsible for the creation of the ‘Surgeon-Apothecary’ group in Edinburgh as he served his internship as what would be a modern day pharmacist initially and was then incorporated as a surgeon unusually without first having served a surgical apprenticeship but as the city had been gripped by the plague, membership levels where very low. His speciality was as an anatomy teacher to student surgeons when human dissection was a much needed but often dark art.
By way of an Edinburgh council remit in 1657, the Surgeon- Apothecary group were granted permission to work on patients as until then the surgeons and apothecaries had completely different areas of practice.
Borthwick died in 1676 and is buried in this infamous grave yard, his monument adorned with a life size, crazy, dancing skeleton carrying a scythe in the style of Father Time, a royal crown and the skull and cross bones, with an array of surgical devices displayed on the sides!
James Hutton the geologist mentioned above is buried in desecrated land that was once the ‘Covenantor’s Prison’ that held circa 1,200 prisoners in around 1679, people who were so called militant Presbyterians and believed in what was known as the National Covenant and whom George MacKenzie, representing the Crown but in his human form, persecuted. Some simply died in the grounds, some were executed for treason, some escaped, and some were freed after signing a bond of loyalty to the Crown and shipped via the Port O’Leith to the US.
If you like Harry Potter, Tom Riddell’s villainous monument is located here too.
The graveyard is famously, from a tourist’s perspective, forever associated with the legend of Greyfriars Bobby, a dog who guarded his dead owner’s grave for 14 years and who has a burial headstone at the entrance. There is a statue and water fountain of Bobby, whose brass nose is now very worn out at the corner of Edinburgh’s Candlemaker Row and George IV Bridge and ridiculously popular for selfies as shown above.
Depending on the narrative you believe, and there are quite a few the dog was either a Skye Terrier or a Dandie Dinmont, who died on 14 January 1872. The best-known variation is that Bobby belonged to John Gray, who worked for the Edinburgh City Police as a night-watchman, with Bobby his formal watch-dog. Gray, under other popular pseudonyms was a farmer, a gardener or other!
Lastly, the churchyard has claimed the burial of other historic figures such as Scottish architect William Adam, its first famous post humous occupant how famously designed Hopetoun House near Edinburgh and Duff House, very close to where I live out the spring and summer months in Banff on the Moray Firth to William Wright, who was a Scottish physician, botanist, infamously part of the slave trade and joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
The leading architect of Edinburgh’s iconic buildings and graves gave his named to a popular pub too!
William Henry Playfair who infamously has a Wetherspoons pub named after him on Piccardy Place by the Vue cinema complex as a posthumous badge of honour was both a leading designer of landmark buildings and largely big-statement and non-conformist tombs in the Auld Reekie, mainly found in the remarkable Dean Cemetery, located high above the Water of Leith and the tourist hotspot that is Dean Village.
Born in 1790, Playfair died in 1857 and is buried in the same grave yard where some of his best work can be seen such as his pink pyramid tomb that inters Lady Sophia Rutherford and her husband Andrew Rutherford who was, among other illustrious jobs, the Lord Advocate of Scotland. His wife, Sophia Stewart died in 1852 where after Playfair built one of the most amazing memorials I have ever seen. The photograph below shows this and is in a line of tombs aptly named The Lord’s Row! His own memorial and the one to Lord Jeffrey are also worth a visit too. Francis Jeffrey qualified as a lawyer and was one of the co-founders of the influential magazine, the Edinburgh Review. He was editor, then became a politician and also the Lord Advocate.
His links to Burke and Hare are tenuous at best but it was he that designed the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh building where the surgeon Robert Knox worked and where he purchased the bodies.
He also was the architect behind the National Gallery of Scotland, the Old College at the University of Edinburgh and the Royal Scottish Academy along with what was termed the east or third New Town and many other Edinburgh neoclassical land marks. The old, steep steps that lead from the top of the Mound, down to the National Gallery are called the ‘Playfair Steps’ in his honour.
Born in London, his father was also an architect and shortly after his death he was sent to Edinburgh to be educated by his uncle John Playfair, usefully a famous mathematician. His alma mater was the University of Edinburgh and after graduating he joined the team of celebrated architect William Stark and eventually joined the Freemasons.
William Playfair died in Edinburgh in 1857, and is also buried in the Lord’s Row on the western edge where he designed monuments for others as shown above.
Since his death and completed in 2004 ‘The Playfair Project’ joined by tunnel the two separate buildings making up the National Galleries and then most recently the southern building has undergone an amazing £38m transformation, with a huge new subterranean section built into the Mound and exiting onto Princes Street gardens with stunning views over Waverley and the old Nor Loch that showcases the very best of Scottish art, with Landseer’s Monarch of the Glen holding court in its new resting place on a huge wall at the end the new building.
While walking around Dean Cemetery recently, located high above Dean Village, sited on the banks of the Water of Leith, I came across the grave of Edinburgh artist John Bellany, noted for his almost impressionist or expressionist, stylised portrait paintings of Scottish icons such as Billy Connolly and Sean Connery, created in the early 90s. Connolly’s portrait called ‘The Entertainer’ is currently not on display but the one of Connery is still exhibited in the National Portrait Gallery today. Once you have seen a Bellany image, you will instantly always know when you see one again.
On the subject of Connolly and Connery, aside from being famous Scottish thespians and having portraits painted by Bellany, at a BAFTA ceremony in 1999, Billy was due to present Sean with a life time achievement award but couldn’t make the event and so over a live TV link from the US said to all the guests present and Connery and his wife ‘You’ve done awfully well for a man with a speech defect’ and ended ‘congratulations baldy, I wish I had your money!’. Praise indeed. Connery died in 2020 and the whole of Scotland will be in mourning when Connolly meets his maker and would pay good money to hear what he says to him.
Bellany was born in Port Seaton in Edinburgh and much of his work has the sea as a main theme which often diverges into his own psyche or human form. Other well-known images merge human and animal forms, often painted in an overtly menacing style, However, his portraits of well-known people such as Connolly, Connery and Ian Botham are the most recognisable for me especially with regards to the colour palette used. His painting style calmed down when he was diagnosed with cancer later in life and he died in 2013 aged 71. When in Edinburgh, it’s well worth looking out for his unique, contemporary works.
Sean Connery’s ashes were scattered in St Andrews.
Below are the two paintings in question and my own photographs from the Edinburgh galleries when they were on show and exhibited to the public.
Beware the Weeping Angels
The Seafield cemetery in Edinburgh, located beside the now defunct Restalrig Railway, a cycle trail and footpath between Leith and the long sandy beach at Portobello is well worth a walk around. Some of the memorials are seemingly straight out of a series of Dr Who.
For lifelong fans like me, the ‘Weeping Angels’ were really scary, ghost like alien creatures in the form of an angel who were introduced in 2007 and that if you blinked, the angel would be able to very rapidly move much closer to you and the end game being that if they can reach out and touch you then you’re sent back in time to a life of purgatory. They are unable to move while being watched by anyone living, including oddly themselves and are turned to stone when an eye is glanced upon them and so the angel below is quite a good representation, especially on a cold, dark day! When stone like, they cannot be harmed.
The then writer and creator Steven Moffat reckons that they are the most popular and frightening foe of the Doctor in that any stone statue could be one, but he would say that wouldn’t he. For me the Daleks and Cybermen will never be bettered but I am over sixty now!
They do really resemble female stone statues in the form of winged angels with draped robes that you might find in a Victorian graveyard like Seafield. However, as they move in closer to you they show off vampire like teeth and clawed fingers and in some episode they even had ‘babies’ that resembled demonic cherubs that laughed and made rather loud footsteps!
Weeping Angels can’t look at each other nor in a mirror and so shield their eyes to avoid paralysis, which is where they get their name from as it looks like they’re weeping but have the ability to send you back in time to an age when you didn’t exist or will ever exist. The resulting forces from this is their life blood.
There are many more nuances but we’ll leave that there!
The Scottish Enlightenment, in a very brief nutshell!
An amalgamation of free minds, ideas and publications was centred in particular in Edinburgh and also over Scotland generally during the second half of the 18th century and for decades prior to and after that. It was a movement of ideas and the debate of those ideas and in philosophy, the two men most prominent were David Hume and Adam Smith.
Edinburgh was then described as hotbed of genius while Voltaire wrote in 1762 rather contentiously that ‘today it is from Scotland that we get rules of taste in all the arts, from epic poetry to gardening’.
David Hume, a leading light in the movement was a philosopher, historian and economist who was best known for his influential beliefs in ‘empiricism, philosophical skepticism and metaphysical naturalism’ which is a view which holds that there is nothing but natural elements, principles, and relations of the type studied by the natural sciences and denies the existence of a transcendent God. Philosophical skepticism is an important form of scepticism in that it rejects knowledge claims that seem certain from the perspective of common sense.
Empiricism is the theory that all knowledge is based on experience derived from the senses and created by those who doubted the possibility of acquiring any knowledge beyond that of the contents of directly felt experience. He believed that ethics were based on emotion and sentiment rather than one’s moral compass.
His mantra that making lives better by finding differentiation between morality, religion, ethics, and society was critical to his ideas but hugely controversial for the time. Hume held that passions rather than reason rule the human psyche saying that ‘Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions’.
His philosophy of religion, as with Hutton’s view on Geology included a rejection of miracles and the existence of a creator God, were especially controversial for their time and where being outspoken on such issues was sometimes dangerous and considered blasphemous, something we need to be careful not to repeat today.
His most famous line was that: ‘The life of man is of no greater importance to the universe than that of an oyster’.
Adam Smith was a social philosopher and a political economist while David Hume and Smith were very close friends.
Smith famously said that ‘Labour was the first price, the original purchase-money that was paid for all things. It was not by gold or by silver, but by labour, that all wealth of the world was originally purchased.’
He believed that wealth is created by hard work and self-interest. Smith’s suggestions that economies that are based on free markets, competition and capitalism are still the bedrock of economics and growth today.
As the self-styled father of economics, he wrote the book ‘Wealth of Nations’ and also suggested that ‘Goods can serve many other purposes besides purchasing money, but money can serve no other purpose besides purchasing goods. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from regard to their own interest’.
Hume died in 1776 and Smith in 1790
Hume is interred at the Old Calton Hill burial ground, just off Waterloo Place in a round, tower like tomb as shown above with a locked gate to keep out the grave robbers while Smith’s body lies in the Canongate Kirkyard close to Holyrood and he has a statue on the Royal Mile.
And finally, Sir Henry Raeburn Scotland’s finest painter…arguably
Raeburn was born Stockbridge, just north of the city centre of Edinburgh and is depending whom you talk to is arguably the best known of all Scottish painters and is buried in St Cuthbert’s churchyard, located at the west end of Princes Street and across the road from the Caledonian Hotel. His formal portraits are instantly recognisable, with legends such as Sir Walter Scott, part of his prolific portfolio, just pay a visit to the National Portrait Gallery on Queen Street to find out!
He actually commissioned and installed his monument and grave at St Cuthbert’s well before he died in 1823, hence including him in my story.
However, perhaps the most famous painting accredited to him and I say that advisedly, may well not be by him at all and is not really a recognised portrait either.
The Reverend Dr Robert Walker skating on Duddingston Loch or colloquially known as ‘The Skating Minister’ was acquired by the National Galleries of Scotland in 1949 for a song and is one of their most popular paintings both to view and as part of its merchandise offering and so they are not going to give up on its provenance despite many believing that Henri-Pierre Danloux, a French immigrant who was based in Scotland at the time, was the painter. Some say that Raeburn simply painted the face and not the majestic motions of the holy man on the ice.
In Michelle Sloan’s great book ‘The Edinburgh Skating Club’ she takes a ‘novel’ approach to the painting’s narrative where her main character Alison Cockburn, who was employed and friends with the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume whom we’ve met above, colludes with his sister, Katherine Hume to live as a man so as to become a member of the prestigious and men only club.
In a coincidental nod to the toxicity of gender reform politics in Scotland these days whereby it was stated that you could self-certify as a woman after a few months of simply deciding to be one, this makes for a remarkably contemporary novel but one full of local historic Edinburgh landmarks, characters and times past.
The background story is set in modern times and catalogues an art historian’s efforts to attribute the work to Danloux and ‘out’ the outlandish fact that Rev Walker might just have been a woman about to win a very big, life changing bet! It’s a great read and a good whodunnit.
Raeburn at the age of 28 moved to London where he met and was hugely inspired by portraitist Joshua Reynolds returning to Edinburgh in 1787 where he started to paint portraits of the Auld Reekie’s rich and famous and was hugely sought after and successful despite being largely self-taught.
He was knighted in 1822 just a year before he died and shortly thereafter was appointed His Majesty’s Limner for Scotland. A limner is an illuminator of manuscripts, or more generally, a painter of ornamental decoration.
Raeburn was especially well known in Scotland as the outstanding portrait painter of members of the Scottish Enlightenment and probably painted in excess of 225 acknowledged pieces.
When the Leith based shipping business, Henry Raeburn and Company, collapsed at the end of 1807, he was declared bankrupt and was left to paint portraits and act as a property developer to pay off creditors for the rest of his life.
His painting of Walter Scott in 1822 was one of Raeburn’s undoubted highlights, someone who also was left bankrupt by a series of poor business decisions and overspending. Later in life he chased warmer weather in Italy by way of a lift on a UK naval frigate but suffered a stroke on his way home, he died in 1832 at Abbotsford, where he is buried. The portrait shows Scott deep in thought at the height of his writing career.
Raeburn’s self-portrait was designed to project himself as the premier painter in the land especially to his peers down in London and painted this as his diploma picture for entry into London’s Royal Academy. He painted in York Place in a New Town house that had large north facing windows and special shutters to create the ultimate conditions for is work. He never made it back to London to paint and died in 1823 and is buried in his chosen resting place at St Cuthbert’s kirkyard at the very west end of Princes Street gardens.
I ain’t afraid of no ghosts — The Ghostbusters song
For me, I’m a great proponent of the new assisted dying law and hope that it becomes part of the statute soon, just as a back stop for those so ill, they can’t bear it any longer. I’ll have a ‘pure cremation’, whereby without any fuss, they take me away in a black bin bag, return me in an urn and I get chucked out into the Moray Firth!
If it was mandatory to have an epitaph I would go for Clement Freud’s idea when he said before he died…it will simply bear my name, and then the date of my death beneath the words ‘best before’.
I don’t believe in ghosts but I wouldn’t want to spend a night alone in Greyfriars, it is a cold, dark and scary place but if graveyards are your thing, the Necropolis of the North or the Auld Reekie is well worth a visit.
I prefer the Cullen Pet cemetery near my home in Moray where I find the messages of love for lost pets far more moving and relevant to me, however in the past stupid EU rules closed it down, but after Brexit, people can once again bury pets themselves and say whatever they like about them.
Go see!

Or what the world’s biggest arts festival taught Leith planner, Claire Wood, about how to be better at her job.
Every August, Edinburgh hosts the biggest arts festival in the world. This year’s Fringe boasted over 55,000 performances of over 3,500 shows. Interestingly, it featured more shows about ‘social issues’ than previous years.
As someone who works for an ad agency and so spends a good portion of her time thinking about social issues and how advertising can persuade people to change harmful habits, I was curious to explore whether you can do the same with theatre. After all, the shortest show I saw this year lasted less than eight minutes. And even eight minutes gives you a better crack at encouraging people to change than a 30 second ad.
Of course, the context is different. Usually (though the Royal Mile in the Fringe is an exception), you actively choose a piece of theatre where you might bump into advertising content. And you usually plump for a particular production because some aspect of it appeals — the creative team, the topic, the actors. Few people actively seek out advertising as a reflection of their world view. (Is last week’s Nike campaign an honourable exception? Discuss.)
But assuming both do their jobs right, whether advertiser or theatre maker, both are creating content that they hope their audience will want to discover. So can we learn anything from theatre makers about how best to persuade people to change their ways? I think so — as follows:
Sometimes, the reasons you might want to behave differently are obvious. Most people now accept that it’s good to wear seatbelts when you’re driving and it’s bad to smoke, for example. But often, in order to persuade people to consider change — or disrupting a pattern — it helps if they understand the context, or the reasons why change is good.
Closed Doors was a quick-witted feisty piece of theatre by Glasgow performance poet, Belle Jones in collaboration with Novasound. Following a Police evacuation of a Glasgow tenement, three women from very different backgrounds are forced to confront the assumptions they’ve made about each other. Topical in these times of terrorist threats, firebombs and foiled plots, Jones’ message — that we should judge less and talk to each other more — is beautifully delivered.
From one woman’s story to another. Earlier this year, the Scottish Government passed a bill that recognised that domestic abuse isn’t only physical; it can also be psychological. ‘Coercive control’ will soon be easier to prosecute though the law will rely on victims coming forward to seek help.
Never Vera Blue was a devastating study of a woman trapped in an abusive relationship. Developed in partnership with the Gaia Centre in Lambeth, the peculiar ways in which coercive control can be exercised were thoroughly explored and the protagonist found a way out. Easy to say but not so easy to do.
By showing an understanding of the peculiar individual misery of an abusive relationship — and then dramatising an escape, Futures Theatre hope to both raise awareness of the problem, of how insidious and invidious coercive control can be and to inspire more people to take action.
2. Showing can help — but sometimes you have to tell
The Half Moon Shania briefly touched on a topic close to our client Drinkaware’s heart: sexual harassment in the night time economy. The musical explored a female punk band’s attempts to hit the big time in an industry all too ready to take advantage of wannabes. Burnt Lemon Theatre had ample opportunity (and didn’t really take it) to land a message about how you could behave if you see someone being harassed on a night out — but then they were making a piece of theatre, not a self-help manual.
At the other end of the spectrum were a bunch of shows that had a very explicit call to action. Part of Death on the Fringe, both User Not Found and Sit With Us For A Moment And Remember took on the tricky topic of grief. At Dante Or Die’s User Not Found, the audience listened to most of the play through headphones but were asked to take them off for the final scene —emphasising the importance of human contact. And I don’t want to ruin the climactic moment of Lincoln Company’s Sit With Us… to be found on a park bench overlooking Edinburgh’s extinct volcano but it was a beautiful reminder of the importance of being there for people.
Both, by building empathy — or at least intrigue in the case of Sit With Us — left a more lingering impression than a poster might.
3. Advocacy is as much as we can hope for
Beyond actually getting people to do the thing you hope they’ll do (CPR! Joining the organ donor register!), urging them to talk about it with friends and family can also be helpful to raise awareness and start to shift attitudes. With organ donation, it’s vital as consent is everything.
Leo Burtin’s The Midnight Soup is intended to do exactly that. As well as having one of the Fringe’s smartest marketing strategies — a ticket for his show also includes your dinner.
Under the auspices of talking about his grandmother’s unexplained suicide, Burtin invites a small audience to help him make soup. As we chop, he tells us about his gran, using her sudden death as a prompt for his audience to discuss their own attitudes towards and preparations for their own end of life care.
The experience of preparing food together, Burtin explained afterwards, helps break down a typically British awkwardness and encourages conversation. The Fringe was a temporary stop off. He’s more usually found taking the show to community centres and care homes — his soup cooker is portable!
Interesting for us advertisers as our field and experiential activity is usually intended to do something similar. We often rely on visual eye candy to attract people to the stand — and then field staff to convey our message. Maybe we need to be thinking harder about how we involve our audiences in the debate.
4. Empathy is everything
Whether we’re trying to persuade people to do an icky bowel cancer test or to drink a little bit less alcohol, we need to show that we understand our audience. Telling without sympathy and / or empathy is only lecturing. And who ever has responded well to that?
And maybe that’s where theatre has the advantage. You’ve bought a ticket for a show — and thereby given permission to whoever it is to talk at you for the next fifty minutes. Where we’re trying to persuade people to take time out of their to do lists and pay attention to us for a frantic thirty second slot. Poor us.
But we could also learn that with enough energy, creativity and vitally, ability to listen, it’s easy (easier, anyway) to empathise with your audience. I’ll Have What She’s Having was a cracking insight into what it is to be young, female, trying your best to have it all but buckling under the pressures of needing to be seen to have a perfect life on social media. Grassmarket Projects’ Where It Hurts looked at the NHS in its seventieth year. A homage to its collective grace and tenacity and a yowl of frustration at escalating demand, it reminded us that lots of health issues can’t be set in plaster and left to heal.
Aside from being a stunning show — I’m eternally grateful to David Amers for telling me at least three times that it was the best thing he’d seen this Fringe — Electrolyte by Wildcard was a stunning study of mental ill-health and the power of friends to help you through. You can read all the books you like about the disorientation, discombobulation, isolation and fear that goes with mental health problems but this young company turned all of that into an hour and ten minutes of gripping, glorious story-telling. Wildcard deliberately set out to give the “unknown and disenfranchised” a voice, thereby empowering them to take action. And Electrolyte does just that, with literal bells on.
And maybe that’s why the Edinburgh Fringe is a little bit like crack cocaine for me. Three weeks, 3,500 shows in a city that’s barely built to cope and every time you step off the street into another dim cavern, you’re bumping up against someone else’s little slice of life in all its unapologetic, fierce, feisty glory. Stories worm their way into your mind and your heart in a way that a textbook will always struggle to do. It might make for an empathy overload. But it’s also a greedy planner’s dream.

When arriving in Edinburgh, Scotland, I had little to no expectations for this trip. With finals being so close to leaving, I didn’t feel I had the time to research these places. I thought the city was beautiful, as I’ve never seen anything like it before. The architecture was amazing, I have never seen so many Gothic buildings. My time here left me with so many beautiful photos. Something I didn’t expect to see here though, was little to no local people! I had no clue that most people who live here are not from the area.
After experiencing the beautiful city of Edinburgh, Scotland, I fully expected Dublin, Ireland, to be very similar. Instead, Dublin was so vivid when I arrived, the city felt more alive than Edinburgh. When comparing them, I would say Edinburgh is like a small tourist town. While Dublin has the tourist town feeling with all of the gift shops, there is so much more to it! I noticed just walking the streets of Dublin I saw so many restaurants and shops I wanted to go back to. The area we went to in Scotland felt almost too geared towards tourists, as a majority of the stores there had the exact same items.
In Dublin, I saw more attractions, retail stores, and restaurants in between…

Last week I was trundling down Leith Walk’s infamous cycle lane and realised that I was having a deeply unpleasant time.
It’s wasn’t the ongoing threat of HGV drivers mounting the kerb, or drivers blasting through STOP signs at the junctions, or having to swerve around the pedestrians squeezed into the cycle lane by the preposterously narrow pavements.
No. It was the dreadful surface quality. Despite a warning from Spokes, the cycling advocacy group, the entirety of this critical active travel route has been hand laid, meaning that while drivers enjoy a beautifully smooth surface on the carriageway, cyclists have to put up with buckarooing their way down the Walk.
This was something worth quantifying, in the hope that the same mistake won’t be made again. Deploying the in-built accelerometer on my phone, I set out to test the primary cycle corridors in the city. I used the busy North Meadow Walk (NMW) as my baseline; it has a good surface, with a few bumps and rough patches.
On NMW I recorded a low median figure— that is, the middle number in all the observations my phone made as I cycled along. I think this is the best way to measure the general condition of the surface as it is not as affected by the very large bumps that come with potholes and other aberrations.
The paths of the north Edinburgh path network, or NEPN, tend to be the smoothest in the city. The new city-centre-west-to-east-link (CCWEL) is also of good quality on this measure.
“Bumps” are how I describe the fluctuations in the surface that can make life miserable for cyclists. To capture the size and frequency of such bumps, I calculated the 95th percentile of recorded acceleration for each of my journeys in Edinburgh. That is, the value at which a particular bump will find itself in the top 5% of all bumps for that particular path.
The same sequence of paths appears, though this time CCWEL doesn’t perform quite as well.
These are the sort of thing that can throw you from the saddle, or knock your panniers off. The 0.999 quantile.
The most severe bumps are found on Leamington Walk, with the Innocent Railway Path also suffering from a particularly awful surface on this measure. CCWEL scores very well, while on-road cycle paths typically do worse.
I gave equal weighting to each of the three measures described above and found that the worst surface you can find in Edinburgh is on Leith Walk’s northbound cycle lane. No surprise.
This was followed by those on McDonald Road and the direct route between Kings Buildings and central campus of Edinburgh University. The worst paths tend to be those that encounter heavy vehicle traffic, or were constructed some time ago.
That makes the brand new cycle-only paths on Leith Walk, Picardy Place and outside Toppings particularly woeful.
I also cycled down the carriageway of Leith Walk and found that for all three of my measures, it’s significantly better than the adjacent cycle lanes.
The most severe bumps have been plotted on this interactive map.
I used a google pixel phone, quadlock phone mount and the Physics Toolbox app to measure acceleration as I cycled along, measuring linear acceleration and recording my position via GPS.
I used the square of acceleration in this analysis on the assumption that discomfort does not correlate 1:1 with acceleration.
My phone made roughly 50 observations per second; after data cleaning, I had nearly half a million observations to play with.
Caveat — my phone isn’t the best measurement tool in the world, and the statistics I have contrived aren’t perfect either. However, I assert that they will be consistent with the experience of most cyclists in Edinburgh.

I’ve been enjoying Simon Young and Chris Woodyard’s podcast Boggart and Banshee, which deals with all manner of fairy encounters, witchcraft, and supernatural accounts.
Their most recent episode covers the mysterious dolls found near Arthur’s Seat in Edinburgh in June 1836. Local boys found a crevice on the hill containing seventeen dolls, a series of male wooden figures about 3–4 inches, clothed in various fabrics and interred in tiny pine coffins. Based upon the amount of decomposition, the dolls had been placed relatively recently. Eight of these dolls have survived until today at the National Museum of Scotland, which has put together an informative page on these finds with all manner of videos and photos of the dolls.
Simon and Chris advance the view that these dolls are used in the practice of malefic magic. Based upon the different fabrics used, they believe that these dolls represent particular victims selected by a local cunning person, wrapped in pieces of stolen clothing and placed in coffins to cause death.
I’m somewhat up in the air on this. Certainly, there is a great deal of local variation and interpretations of many different magical techniques, so depositing images in this manner is not necessarily out of the realm of practice. Yet this does leave several questions open.
One of the most common magical experiments recorded in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was the creation of two wax images to recover goods lost through theft. Calling upon angels to assist, the magician was told to put the wax close enough to the fire to be heated… but not too close, lest it cause injury. This technique was still known in Britain in the 1850s, as it appears in the magical notebook of the Liverpool cunning man William Dawson Bellhouse. So our hypothetical Edinburgh cunning person is likely to have known for a much less involved method to cause death through image magic.
This is by no means definitive, of course — a magician might not have heard of this technique, or lacked access to wax for some reason, or wanted to cause a long lingering death (see below), or any number of other possibilities.
Another question is the method of deposition. The most likely place to deposit malefic magic directed against a person is on their property — either in secret, so as to work its sorcery through proximity as long as possible, or openly, as a warning to the person. There are other models, of course. Yet I have trouble understand why a cunning person would use a cavern atop a high hill near a major urban center, returning to the site seventeen times. Why not bury each coffin individually elsewhere, in the manner suggested here? Why risk discovery of the assemblage by repeated visits?
What would be an alternative explanation, then? I think previous examiners have missed the most obvious clue — and those of you who have been following my roleplaying accounts know what it is.
We have a set of entirely male figures — according to some, made to appear as soldiers — hidden in a cave on a major geographic feature named after King Arthur. Could it be that these dolls are a tribute in honor of the Once and Future King, who is often credited with resting with his knights in caverns across Britain until he comes forth again to save the land?
Admittedly, I’d feel better about this theory if there was a doll discovered that had a crown. But some of the dolls were destroyed, and given that they were in various degrees of decomposition, it’s likely any hypothetical “Arthur” doll would have been the first added and in the worst shape of all.
I’d be interested to hear what you think. Is this plausible? Am I missing something?

Today I’m going to take you on a walking tour through old Edinburgh. This piece was originally written as a script for an armchair audio tour. It incorporates stories about historical figures like Mary, Queen of Scots, the body snatchers Burke and Hare, William Wallace and Robert the Bruce as well as tales of ghosts and witches, and a sprinkling of architecture. It is intended to be read out loud and listened to on a rainy afternoon by a roaring fire with a glass of single malt whisky to hand. Slàinte mhath!
Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland, is my hometown. It regularly makes the top ten lists of best places to live in the world and best cities to visit. In summer, because Edinburgh is so far north, you can enjoy about 18 hours of daylight. The Old Town is a World Heritage Site and stretches along a ridge from Castle Rock down to the Palace of Holyroodhouse.
Edinburgh is built on seven hills which provide a dramatic backdrop to the city’s skyline. These hills include Arthur’s Seat, an ancient volcano that provides panoramic views of the city and beyond, and Calton Hill, home to some of Edinburgh’s most iconic monuments.
Now, close your eyes, and take a deep breath. The weather today is cool, with a breeze that carries the fresh salty air from the nearby North Sea. Feel the damp, misty air on your face. Exhale and relax.

There is this idea that if you know an area, a city, you can look up its main street and see years of history having already been made. The geography of it literally recalls history just in looking. There’s where this happened, here’s where that happened. . .
Take a look down Edinburgh Scotland’s Royal Mile, and you surely see down a millenium. Starting at the west end, there’s Edinburgh Castle, site of more than a few siege takings. In it was born a king, and in it one died, as well. The king born was King James of Scotland, son of Mary Queen of Scots. He was later asked to be the king of England as well. His mom had his dad killed, it is rumored, in the castle. At best, the whole thing was a shady ordeal. Mary, Queen of Scots was not born in it, but she ruled from it for a number of years.
Maybe you think of a queen as someone in her 40’s or 50’s, but no, Mary was a maiden of some 20 something years when she returned to Scotland from France to rule the people of Scotland. But she is another story.
Come out from the castle to the promenade where the Tattoo is held. This tattoo is a military celebration of sorts, held every year during the Edinburgh International Festival in August. At this tattoo several different military regiments from all over Scotland come to show off their skills, uniforms and Scottish pride for all the world to see, and it is quite a show. It is best to take in the later of the two evening events, as the fireworks are more spectacular later on. In August, it is broad daylight at 9:30 pm! So, the good watching is around 11:30.
The Royal Mile is not the official name of the street, it is more an honorary title given to it. This is actually more than a mile, from Edinburgh Castle to Holyrood Palace, at the east end. The Royal Mile actually has 4 street names given to it. The street numbering system has them running out of numbers in short order, so they just change the street name every few blocks, and that takes care of it. Two of those names were done away with, and one assigned to that portion.
Coming from the promenade is Johnston Terrace, which extends east to Bank Street. At this corner is a speakeasy known as Deacon Brodie’s Tavern. Deacon Brodie was a highly respected cabinetmaker; well at least during the day. At night, it was a different story. He was known to be a robber in the night hours. One time he was caught in the coffers of the national treasury. He escaped then and fled the country. He then wrote a note to someone he knew in Edinburgh, from what he thought was a secure location. Authorities were able to determine this so-called secure location, went after him, placed him under arrest, brought him back to Scotland, and hung him on gallows he had himself built for someone else. It was his double life that inspired the Robert Louis Stevenson epic novel, “Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde”.
At Bank Street, the mile becomes High Street, a name which stays with it for most of its length. Walk half a block east on High Street, cross the street, and you see one landmark, the Heart of the Lothian, built into the brickwork just a few feet out the door of St. Giles Cathedral. Scotland is divided into several regions, and Edinburgh is in the center of the Lothian Region. So, the Heart of the Lothian is dead center of this region. In much earlier days, there was a prison on this site.
As I said, this Heart of the Lothian is but a few feet away from the head worship center of the Church of Scotland, St. Giles Cathedral. The Presbyterian Church worldwide has its origins here. What we call the Presbyterian Church, in Europe, is called the Church of Scotland. Its most famous preacher and head was John Knox, a Scot himself, born in Gifford. Knox was himself a disciple of John Calvin of Germany, but when he took his own stand in Scotland it was at St. Giles, and he re-established the church there. Knox was in the pulpit while Mary was on the throne just up the street, and he was heard to speak of the need for dethroning for her deeds. To re-establish St. Giles as such took evicting some adherents of the Church of England. They left and started Old St. Paul’s Episcopal Church.
The Royal Mile runs downhill, west to east, and there are some cross streets, but to facilitate passage down the hill to the north, and indirect access to patrons on the Mile, stepped passageways called closes where built here and there between buildings. It is in these closes that other establishments were located. There are many closes up and down the Mile, and each has its own history.
Step out the east door of St. Giles, take but a few steps, and you arrive at a round structure with a gabled roof known as the Mercat Cross. This was an ancient assembly point for people of the town. They assembled there to hear governmental decrees, proclamations, and to witness public hangings.
One website describes it thus: “the old center of town- marketplace, news-stand, pulpit and gallows . . . it was a real one stop shop!”
The present Mercat Cross does not stand where the original did, but that location is marked by a cross laid into the sidewalk. It was the center of the old Edinburgh.
Going a block or so east on the mile, one arrives at Tron Kirk. Kirk is Scottish for church. (Talk about the US and the UK- two countries separated by a common language!) Now before Knox arrived at St. Giles, the Church of England had pretty well dispatched the Church of Scotland out of the place. They went a block east and built the Tron Kirk.
Actually, it was called “The Bishop’s War, where the king tried to introduce Episcopal structure into the Church of Scotland. He actually took over St. Giles and made it the seat of the Bishop of the Church of England.
So, the Church of Scotland people, refusing this intrusion, went and built the Tron Kirk. The building itself is no longer a church, but its physical structure remains as a visitor center.
Cross the street again, and head east from North Street, walking until you get to a large building called Carrubbers Christian Center. Carrubbers was founded back in the 19th Century in the Carrubbers Close, as a mission. Dwight L. Moody came and brought his chief musician Ira Sankey, and together they raised enough money to build this large 4 story evangelistic center. Originally built with a two-story worship center, the lower floor was converted to other uses in recent years. The center has been a beacon of hope to Edinburgh since its inception and remains so today. It has a library, a meeting hall, and dorm rooms on the top floor for university students as well as visiting clergy.
Go further east, on that side of the street, and the building that juts out and establishes a new position for the fronting buildings is the home of the preacher from the cathedral up the street, John Knox. Knox lived here during his years when he pastored at St. Giles Cathedral. His years pastoring St. Giles were also his last. He died in this house. I will warn you, though, that the people who marked his life with this museum were not terribly kind to his message of the Gospel or his dealings.
Going further down the street one more block, the Royal Mile changes its name to Canongate, a city gate from early days of the town. On Canon Gate, one walks the rest of the mile to Holyrood Palace, the annual accommodations for the Queen of England in June. The royal family also spends a month in the north of Scotland, at Balmoral Castle.
To look up the Royal Mile is to look up into history, and it always reminds you. A sea mist, called a haar, can roll in though, and you won’t see past a block, they are so thick. But you’ll never forget where you’ve been!

Nobody cares about the fact I’m going to Edinburgh Fringe and neither should they. I’m a comedian going on a jolly for a couple of weeks in a great city with loads of my pals and trying to make people laugh. Yes it’ll probably bankrupt me and I’ve done everything in my power to not lose money hand over fist but even so, nobody is forcing me, it’s fucking great at it’s core (once we overthrow the Tories up there charging thousands for August rents). I could use this piece to get extremely angry about class and how it’s easy to do it if you’re secretly loaded, but we all know that, so allow me to drivel on for 800 words (681 from here on in, OK and that used up five, we’re nearly there) and hopefully encourage you to tweet the link to this piece with one of the following quotes above the link so people think I’ve made some sort of life-changing point;
My show is about…..WOMEN. Does that make you uncomfortable?! Probably not. You might even know one. It came from working in women’s media and being told every day what to be angry at, what to be turned on by, what to be repulsed by, who to be angry at and why you must always, every single day, be told how to ask for a pay rise. There’s an entire industry dedicated to books about work. Can you believe it? Titles like ‘How To Get What You Want At Work And Shag Your Colleague Respectfully’ and ‘How To Boss Bitch Your Way Into Millions Of Pounds And Shit On Everyone You Know.’ People buy them! Where is the book that says ‘Here’s How To Never Fill In A TimeSheet Ever Again’ — I would buy that. Read books about shagging and love and mad stuff! Not the thing you do all day! I digress.
My show is about how sometimes I’m not angry at the right things and I do stupid shit and that true equality is ripping the piss out of men and women. The day Mother’s Day cards contain a joke is the day Gloria Steinem can have a quick fag break to relax before cracking on with the serious stuff.
And of course, there are properly awful things going on for women at the moment, but you all know about that too. I’m just inviting you to come and laugh at me for 45 minutes in the back of a pub and maybe sling me a tenner at the end for my efforts. (If you don’t, you’re sexist) A lot of Edinburgh shows are about something moving, poignant, tragic or dark, I’m here to tell you that my parents are both alive, sadly were very supportive of me, and never ask me if I’m going to get married. They fed me almost exclusively Findus Crispy Pancakes and Spaghetti Hoops for about 12 years as well so in many ways, they’re legends. I’ve got nice pals, big dark roots that I can’t afford to dye, and my life has mostly been pretty good, despite my job on the ASDA checkout and Morrisons chicken counter, so you can see my issue. In many ways, making a show out of almost exclusively stupid sexual decisions is actually harder. No pun intended. Well it is now, I wrote it and then realised.
Please come and see Woman In Progress at Southsider, 6th — 17th August, at 5.45pm. You won’t regret it, straight away at least. It’s with PBH Free Fringe, so just pay what you want at the end!
Follow me on Instagram if you liked this [at]alexandrahaddow
Thanks and hopefully see you there!

As a frequent visitor to Edinburgh, I’ve had the opportunity to explore some of the city’s best-kept secrets. While it’s easy to get caught up in the popular tourist attractions, there’s so much more to this beautiful city that often goes unnoticed. Here’s my personal guide to some of Edinburgh’s best hidden gems.
St. Bernard’s Well — Tucked away in the Dean Village, this hidden gem is a peaceful haven away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The well was built in the late 18th century and has a unique design that is said to be based on the Temple of Vesta in Italy. The tranquil setting and stunning architecture make it the perfect spot for a quiet moment of reflection.
The Writers’ Museum — While many visitors flock to the Edinburgh Castle or the National Museum of Scotland, the Writers’ Museum is often overlooked. This hidden gem celebrates the lives and works of three of Scotland’s most famous writers: Robert Burns, Sir Walter Scott, and Robert Louis Stevenson. The museum is located in a 17th-century building just off the Royal Mile and is filled with fascinating artifacts and exhibits.
The Royal Botanic Garden — While not exactly a hidden gem, the Royal Botanic Garden is often overshadowed by other popular attractions in Edinburgh. The garden boasts a vast collection of plant species from around the world, as well as stunning views of the city. It’s the perfect place for a leisurely afternoon stroll or a peaceful picnic.
Stockbridge — This charming neighborhood is just a short walk from the city center, yet it feels like a world away. With its eclectic mix of independent shops, cafes, and restaurants, Stockbridge is a great place to explore and soak up the local culture. Don’t miss the weekly farmers’ market, which is brimming with fresh, locally sourced produce.
The Sheep Heid Inn — Tucked away in the charming village of Duddingston, this historic pub is said to be the oldest in Scotland. The pub’s unique attraction is its skittle alley, a game similar to bowling that’s fun for all ages. It’s a great spot for a pint and a game of skittles with friends.
And now for a joke related to this post — Why did the writer bring a map to the Royal Botanic Garden? To find the roots of all the hidden gems! Okay, maybe it’s not the best joke, but I hope it made you smile.
As a frequent visitor to Edinburgh, I can say that these hidden gems are some of my favorite places in the city. Whether you’re a first-time visitor or a seasoned traveler, I hope this guide inspires you to explore all that Edinburgh has to offer.

I stepped foot in Edinburgh many decades ago and immediately fell in love with the place. That first sight of the city will never leave me, and I still adore the way it holds its head high. It was the strongest against Brexit, it has more graduates as a percentage than virtually any other place on the planet, and it hosts world-class innovation and research. While its infrastructure is never at a scale that the mighty London can achieve in terms of innovation, it is livable, walkable, and a fairly safe place to live.
And, so, I just loved this quote [here]:
The mix of old and new, tradition and innovation, sums up my city. Around its ancient building exists world-leading research and innovation, and, like Glasgow, it is focused on technology and scientific advancements. The city nurtured three of our cybersecurity spin-outs, and I believe we could not have succeeded as well as they did without the help of the city — in supporting investment, collaborations, and most of all, attracting the talent needed to build high-impact companies. While Brexit was a major spanner in the works, the city has managed to showcase its economic resilience — more to do with its people and businesses than by politicians — and continues to build its place on an international stage.
For students, it’s a great place to come and study and is in the Top 10 cities of the world for this. In the QS World guide, the rankings for the best city to study are [here]:
For a relatively small city, a Top 10 finish is amazing. But, it’s not a big city, and that’s a good thing! Many people can live and work within an area that allows you to walk to work, or, at least, get a bus. In fact, Edinburgh buses are great. While we have a new tram, most Edinburgh people still use the bus to get around. You are typically just 30 minutes away from anywhere in Edinburgh.
And, so, if you like hills — Edinburgh has seven of these, and an extinct volcano to walk around. For beaches, you choose whatever style you like, and for parks, you’ll find one at every turn. But, the best thing, is that it is a truly enterprising and innovative city, that prides itself on its love of education and scientific advancement.
Cities are key to our future. They are economic drivers and places to innovation. Care for your city, and let it live.

This week in Edinburgh, GDS hosted its first in-person Design System Day conference. Here are a few of my highlights from the day.
Dynamic Earth felt like a strangely appropriate place to host Design System Day 2023: the giant globe hanging above our heads was a fitting metaphor for the planetary consequences of national scale design decisions.
Samantha Ernstzen and Jennifer l’Anson reflected on the process of creating the Scottish Government Digital Design System.
Their purpose was refreshingly succinct:
“to enable teams within the Scottish public sector to design and build digital products that are accessible, usable and consistent for people accessing public services in Scotland.”
Adoption is always a challenge. Even with a strong design system, people can still put together bad forms with good components! We’ve all seen examples of digitised forms recreating the paper original, mirroring the many-boxes-per-page approach of the pre-digital era.
The challenge isn’t just educating government departments in how best to use a design system, it’s also getting external suppliers to embrace it.
Mandating use of an existing design system isn’t enough: we need to support agencies and consultancies in adopting it and implementing it successfully!
Ciandelle, Calvin and Steve gave a quickfire summary of all the updates GOV.UK have been making, including improving accessibility.
One newly released development is the Exit this page feature. It allows a user to quickly close down a page if they are in danger: particularly useful for those suffering domestic abuse. It may look like just a small button, but took about five years of work to research and implement!
Massive news: designers were delighted to hear that a new crown’s gonna drop — watch this space for a slightly modified GOV.UK logo coming soon!
Katrina Birch facilitated a fantastic panel on trauma-informed research and design.
70% of people have experienced trauma, and 1 in 10 will suffer from PTSD at some point in their life. We should be aware of trauma and the risk of vicarious trauma when conducting user research around difficult topics. Shout out to Chayn, getting an honourable mention for their excellent resources on the topic.
Tash Willcocks closed out the day with her thoughts on the elephant in the room: teams.
Design systems are enablers of scale and consistency, but developing and establishing them requires conditions of high trust and psychological safety.
In short, to save the parrots, we must use the shallot and master the elephant (I promise it made sense, you had to be there).
Thanks so much to all the volunteers and GDS-ers that made Design System Day 2023 possible: it was a glorious gathering of passionate practitioners!
A final quote from the day, sums up nicely the role of design in most organisations:
“We’re not here just to build components and patterns. We make impact through multiplier effects.”
Looking forward to next year!

HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT
I recall standing outside the Pleasance Dome flyering my show a few years ago.
I was exhausted and knew I had to fill a big room and faced losing cash so I was anxious and desperate to make sure people came to see me.
I had rented a good flat and paid for amazing posters and had what I believed to be a fabulous show.
Then I spotted a couple of people who had seen me at a showcase show and had taken my flyer after the gig as they liked my stuff. I brightened up and as I approached them I watched a comedy promoter hand them two free tickets to his latest newly signed act’s show.
They took them. They were FREE.
He had a HUGE wad of free tickets and was giving them to people all around the Pleasance Dome. I lost the sale. I watched and my heart sank as people didn’t give a fuck how funny I had been at the 1pm showcase show.
They had free tickets and free is everything in this current climate.
No doubt the fringe this year yet again will release the BEST EVER SALES AT THE FRINGE and sit back as they manipulate the figures and the PR will spin it good.
I know that the figures aren’t always true, for ONE BIG SELL OUT there are hundreds of smaller shows underwriting them in the big venues and those comics were doing it on their own cash in the hope of a crowd.
Performers go home skint, owing money and are artistically broken.
I have no issue with the big paid venues, I just see issues that the Free Festival can resolve.
On the last weekend of the last few fringe’s I watched BIG NAMED ACTS give away TWO for ONES on the last Thursday and Friday. That’s not a great financial sign and was I aggressively flyered for a comic whose face graces the BILLBOARDS to buy tickets for his ‘EXTRA SOLD OUT SHOW’ which is a weird oxymoron. It can’t be sold out and still have tickets to sell.
Also audience members must be horrified to find out they had paid full price for tickets and realised half the audience were in for free or HALF PRICE and that’s an insult to early bird ticket buyers.
People were so scared of losing face.
This year am back at The Counting House Ballroom as is my daughter comedian Ashley Storrie.
Last year both me and Ashley had a BUMPER run and played to full rooms every day. I had people sitting on the floor of my venue and Ashley had people standing in her room and outside for a chance to get in.
They put cash in the buckets. We left with a profit, a very good profit if truth be told. We also told the crowds if they donated silver and bronze coins we gave that to the homeless and later on we dished it out fairly round the city’s street collectors.
I encouraged other comics and acts to get up and pitch their shows to my big comedy loving full capacity crowd. I tweeted about other comics gigs and helped flyer for other shows. It felt like THE FRINGE.
The people who came to the shows were brilliant.
Dealing with hard cash was weird. I felt like a mid price day time sex worker, I haven’t had that much money in my bag in years. We generally don’t carry much cash as a society now. It reminded me of when I owned a pub and used to count the takings.
People no longer see the Free Festival shows as ‘well it’s free it must be shit’ and I don’t believe they ever did. This is a nice neat rumour and label put on it by the same people who resent the free shows but have no issue giving out free tickets at a paid venue for a show that can’t shift a ticket.
When I did all the big “paid” venues I made thousands of pounds but the financial cut left to me was woeful and I STILL made a profit am one of the few who did. My accountant was stunned by the business model that means you pay for seats in advance and a venue is guaranteed their cash and cut NO MATTER WHAT before you step foot in the capital. The artist takes all the risk. Every seat you dont sell the venue has already been paid for that, the loss is not theirs….it’s YOURS.
Think of it this way…
Imagine you hired a bus with twenty seats, you paid the company for twenty seats….if you only sold 6 of those seats, you lose money.
Now think of that in a 200 seater venue at the fringe where the market is SATURATED with comics giving away FREE SEATS AND TWO FOR ONE SEATS every single day. Now you see my point.
Tax was a well worn phrase when talking about the free venues.
“Yes, but do the free festival comics declare their takings?” one comedy promoter asked me.
I don’t think anybody has the right to assume anyone is fucking their taxes based on a dislike of their business model. If you have an issue with people not paying their due tax please go check some Tory peers before you nitpick at comics you avaricious cunts. While you are at it please make sure the big venues who boast “BEST YEAR EVER” are not putting their profits into an offshore account to avoid taxes in UK.
I pay my tax.
I love the fringe and the past few years doing free fringe shows means I have loved it more. It felt like the old days. It felt good and it felt fair.
I encouraged the people who were skint and living under austerity to come see our shows for free. I also encouraged people who saw the show to take money OUT OF THE BUCKET if they needed some cash.
some tips for acts putting on a FREE SHOW….
Me and My daughter Ashley Storrie are back at the Counting House this year.

Today marked the conclusion of our journey. We had been traveling for nine days and were eager to get home. It had been a while since we had unwinded and slept in our bed at home.
Another reason was my spouse wasn’t feeling well. Our outing in Stonehaven yesterday gave him the chills. We were lucky he did not become ill while traveling, as it would have derailed our entire itinerary.
However, on our final day in Edinburgh, we had one more day of exploring before ending our trip.
After leaving our cabin, we headed towards Dundee on the Tay estuary. Around 11 am, we reached the magnificent city of Dundee. Everything appeared wonderful, and the weather was ideal.
Fun Fact: In 2014, Dundee was recognized by the United Nations as the UK’s first-ever UNESCO City of Design.
We went to a cafe and had a tuna sandwich with coffee. We strolled beside the Tay River. The River Tay is the longest river in Scotland and the seventh-longest in Great Britain.

In the heart of Scotland lies a city steeped in history, culture, and academia: Edinburgh. Home to one of the world’s most prestigious universities, the University of Edinburgh, the city attracts students from all corners of the globe. Among the many challenges that come with starting a new chapter in a different city, finding the perfect accommodation stands as a pivotal moment in a student’s life.
Picture this: a vibrant young student, full of ambition and excitement, stepping foot into the historic cobblestone streets of Edinburgh. For many, this marks the beginning of an incredible journey towards higher education and personal growth. But behind this exciting new chapter lies a quest for the perfect place to call home during these formative years.
For Jamie, a student hailing from London, the search for student accommodation Edinburgh was both thrilling and daunting. Having been accepted into the University of Edinburgh’s prestigious business program, Jamie found himself faced with the task of finding accommodation that suited not only his budget but also his need for a conducive environment for studying.
The quest began online, scrolling through countless listings and options. From shared flats to purpose-built student accommodations, the choices seemed endless. Each listing had its unique charm, promising proximity to the university, modern facilities, and a vibrant community of fellow students.
After much deliberation, Jamie narrowed down his options to a few promising prospects. He decided to visit Edinburgh in person, a decision that would prove invaluable in his search. Stepping into the city, he was greeted by its rich history and the blend of old-world charm with a bustling modernity — a juxtaposition that captured his heart instantly.
His first visit was to a student housing complex located conveniently close to the university. As he walked through the doors, he was met with a lively atmosphere — students chatting in the common areas, engaging in study groups, and overall, a sense of community that was palpable. The rooms were modern, compact yet cozy, equipped with all the essentials a student could need. The allure of being surrounded by like-minded peers was tempting.
However, Jamie wanted to explore other options before making a decision. He ventured into the heart of the city, where charming old buildings were converted into student flats. The historic ambiance was undeniable, but the rooms were often smaller and lacked some of the modern amenities he had seen in the purpose-built accommodations.
Then came the visit to a shared flat — a common choice among students looking for a more independent living experience. The prospect of living with a few roommates excited Jamie. The flat was spacious, with each room uniquely decorated, reflecting the personalities of its occupants. The idea of creating a home away from home with fellow students felt appealing, fostering a sense of camaraderie.
After careful consideration and weighing the pros and cons of each option, Jamie ultimately chose to reside in the purpose-built student accommodation. Its proximity to the university, modern amenities, and the vibrant community it offered aligned perfectly with his aspirations for his university life.
Settling into his new accommodation, Jamie found himself surrounded by a diverse group of students — each with their own stories, cultures, and ambitions. The communal spaces became a hub for socializing, studying, and forging lifelong friendships.
Living in student accommodation in Edinburgh wasn’t just about having a place to stay; it was an integral part of Jamie’s university experience. It became the backdrop for late-night study sessions, impromptu gatherings, and the formation of lasting bonds.
As Jamie delved deeper into his studies, he realized that the choice of accommodation had a profound impact on his overall university journey. The convenience, the sense of community, and the support from fellow students made navigating the challenges of university life more manageable.
Looking back, Jamie reminisces about the thrill of finding the perfect place to live in Edinburgh. It wasn’t just a roof over his head; it was the cornerstone of his university adventure — a place where he didn’t just reside but truly belonged.
For any student venturing into the vibrant city of Edinburgh, the quest for accommodation may seem like a daunting task, but it’s a journey filled with choices that shape an unforgettable university experience — a journey much like Jamie’s, filled with exploration, decisions, and ultimately, a place to call home.

Glasgow, Edinburgh’s younger and cheekier brother. A winter’s visit to this exciting city filled me with a lot of excitement. The journey began with a night bus from London Victoria to Buchanan Street Station, north of the English/ Scottish border. As soon as I arrived on the bus, I was surrounded by the echoes of the thick Glaswegian accent. Coupled with that were men chewing away on Sainsbury’s 5 packs of donuts and mothers and daughters arguing about who had the window seat. Presumably the views from the Megabus up the M40 and M6 overnight weren’t to be missed. On arrival at 7am into Glasgow, it was still dark. I was due to visit one of my oldest friends, Greg Bond, however I would first be met by his namesake, Greggs, who provided me with a coffee and Pan au Chocolat to welcome me to Scotland. The sun only lights up the city 30 minutes after it would in London, which is also known for its excellent weather. I wandered through the chartered streets of the city where I was surprised by an incredible orange and yellow sunset that crept over the Lanarkshire hills and the schemes that fill Glasgow’s skyline.
Arching past the Glasgow Necropolis (the cemetery) and the Tennents beer factory, I wandered to the East End of the city to meet Greg and his girlfriend, Jess. We soon headed to Tibo Bistro, a local Scottish brunch eatery where I tried my first full Scottish breakfast. This included, black pudding and haggis, both of which I hadn’t tried for a very long time but were incredibly tasty. Glasgow has an excellent selection of restaurants, notably to add, the Ubiquitous Chip, which I previously visited in 2016 on my first visit to this city (I would highly recommend both of these places). The rest of the day would be spent hopping around bars and watching football, the hoops (Celtic) no less were playing at home and some of the bars refused to show the premier league but rather would show the Scottish games. It’s understandable, really. You got a real sense of how strong the local identity is in Glasgow. Not only from the accent and their pride towards either Rangers or Celtic Football Clubs but also from their use of language. Words you would never use in the South of England, or internationally in this language. ‘Spu*k’, ‘C*nt’ and ‘Sh*te’ are all very much on the table and part of the local tongue. Jess mentioned this is just part of the Glasgwegian identity and people of all ages, with the exception of really formal events or in the company of elderly family, would people liberallly use these words. For example, Jess said ‘I don’t want to sp*nk all my money away travelling’. The sense of irony was real for me here.
We stopped for a bite to eat at a chicken burger joint, complemented naturally by a pint of Tennents, of course. Here, we met Greg’s friends Gus, with whom he shared his birthday event with that evening and Zac, who I’d met many moons ago while he and Greg were at university here. We then headed to a bar called the rum shack, where we met more of their friends, most of whom were from Greg and Gus’ former and current hockey clubs. Being in Glasgow and with a lot of sporty, sociable folks, this made for quite a drink heavy evening. We played a game called ‘ou l’est le poulet’, which literally translates from French as ‘where is the chicken?’. Here, Gus and Greg identified themselves as the ‘chickens’ and they organised a kitty of money for drinks for them and whoever could find them throughout the night. They selected 15–20 bars within a few miles radius of the rum shack and they said the first to meet us at the one they were at will be able to benefit from the complimentary drinks from the budget. The first there would receive a Champagne reception. Luckily, I was with two local Glaswegian blokes who knew Greg, Gus and the city very well so we made it to this grand reception after stopping at only 2 other pubs on the way to the Ivory hotel. The Ivory was an eyesore geographically away from the collection of other proposed pubs. We thought we’d go and check it just to be sure, but we didn’t genuinely believe that they’d actually be there. As the rest of the groups arrived, we then settled into the drinks from the kitty as well as some tasty nachos. The night continued from the Ivory hotel to another bar in town. After 12 hours on the beers on the back of a night bus, I decided to call it an evening before my flight home in the morning back to London town. All in all, I’d highly recommend this city for food, drinking and a good time watching sport. But keep an eye and an ear open for the Glaswegian tongue.

When Henry was a wee one I read to him every night. He’d pick two or three picture books from his bookshelf, and we’d cuddle in the couch or his bed, and read together. As a train fanatic he had quite a few train books, and Slow Train from Oxmox was one of his favorites.
The little book was about just that, a slow train goes through the country and encounters animals and assorted obstacles. It’s whimsical and cheerful, perfect for a night time story.
When I spent a little over two weeks in London in April, one of my goals was to venture outside the city and explore other parts of UK. I picked Edinburgh for the second weekend. For years Edinburgh Yarn Festival was one of the go-to fiber events in Europe, and I’m still kicking myself for not making it in 2019, because no one knew that was going to be the last one. Regardless, Edinburgh the city still held my intense interest and I decided that was my destination for the weekend.
The train from Kings Cross Station in London to Edinburgh is a little over five hours on LNER line (LNER stands for London North Eastern Railway and is pronounced with the letters spelled out, not “liner” as I first thought), and the route goes along the east side of England, at some point right by the beach. The views are stunning. — Side note, after the trip I rewatched Harry Potter movies. I can’t tell you how thrilling it was to see the LNER trains in the background every time they were in Kings Cross Station.
I took off from London on Friday morning, spent Friday evening to Sunday morning in Edinburgh. I booked the return trip to leave around 1:30pm, so I’d have lunch in Edinburgh and be back in London for dinner. The train ride is very comfortable with free wifi and electric outlets, so I could listen to my audiobook while knitting, or napping. I had a window seat facing forward as I picked, and most of the time the seat next to me was empty.
About an hour outside of London, suddenly there was loud metal screeching and the train lurched forward, eventually came to a stop, but not before there was a big thump, hitting something big. Soon the conductor’s voice came through the scratchy speaker, yes, there was a deer on the track and the train hit it; yes, the engineers would have to check out the damage, and no, no one could get off the train. Of course they would keep the passengers updated. But what about Bambi??
So we wait. Every ten minutes or so the conductor came on the speaker, still checking the damage, getting help from the next station, possibly moving everyone to another train. Just how big was Bambi? Maybe Bambi was a big boy with big horns, big enough to cause the train to lose air pressure. The next, closest, station was fifteen minutes away, and from the conductor’s voice, the engineers wondered aloud if the train would be able to go that far with the damage, or have another train fetch all the passengers. Neither option seem comforting when you are in the middle of the beautiful but remote English countryside. I looked on Google Map and the only thing nearby was a tiny nursery school. I wondered where the kids came from.
More than an hour after the thump, a train materialized itself on the track next to our train, going the same direction(!), and very slowly came to a stop(!!). Passengers started moving around, gathering their bags— are we being rescued? How do we all fit in that already packed train? Before we knew it, just like how it came, the train slowly started moving again, and minutes later, gone.
Now what? I’m sure I wasn’t the only one started calculating how much water and food might be in our luggage and in the dining car.
Apparently the other train dropped off some engineers, because soon there were a bunch of people in bright neon green and orange garb walking along the tracks, toward the head of our train.
More waiting. Thirty minutes later the train moved! And continued to run like nothing happened, till it unceremoniously stopped at the next station, Peterborough, where everyone was ordered to pack their things and depart, find their own ways. I guess all this was announced in the running gargles from the conductor, and I wasn’t the only one confused once we landed on the cold platform. Now it’s up to this tiny station to deal with hundreds of unexpected passengers heading to London, already delayed for hours.
You got to give it to the British for efficiency. The little station handled the glitch better than most American airports. The digital display spelled out clearly how many trains are passing and heading to Kings Cross in the next hour, which cars had seats, and what section of the platform had the best chance to get on the train. No one checked tickets. The bathroom queue went from over fifty to none. By the third train most people were out of the station and on their way to London.
I arrived at Kings Cross past 11pm, more than four hours after planned, cold and hungry. I was ready for a hot meal and warm bed.

Edinburgh during the fringe is a glorious celebration of the artistic spirit, with any tourist walking down the Royal Mile sure to be deluged with flyers from young people eager to promote their low-budget show. While having a coffee in George Square, I was approached by someone hawking a one-person re-enactment of the Titanic disaster, an improvised musical called Shamilton and a lady (with a haystack hairdo) impersonating Melania Trump.
But the image that most visitors will take away from the 2022 fringe is of overflowing rubbish bins and gutters strewn with discarded coffee cups and takeaway meal cartons. The binmen were on a two-week strike. The dispute has since spread through much of the rest of Scotland.
The refuse collectors are protesting about a 5% pay offer which they rightly point out will not match the rate of inflation. The pay “rise” is thus, in real terms, a pay cut. Small wonder that they are protesting.
But the speed with which Edinburgh descended into slovenliness is an illustration of the theme I wrote about in my last book, More; that our standard of living depends on the efforts and co-operation of millions of strangers. It is not just that we eat food that was grown on the other side of the world or rely on communication tools made in Asia. We depend on our fellow citizens to educate our children, keep us healthy, defend our borders and clean our streets.
This co-operation faces two interlinked threats. The first is that international trade in goods and services relies on a willingness to trust other countries, and to place economic interests above strategic desires. The first great era of globalisation in the late 19th century saw vast levels of migration from Europe to the “new worlds” of North and South America, and monetary co-operation that allowed the Bank of England to borrow from its counterparts in France and Russia when its gold reserves were low. But it all disintegrated with the outbreak of war in 1914; world trade (as measured by exports as a proportion of GDP) did not recover until the 1970s.
The late 19th century era has been dubbed the “pax Britannica” as Britain was the centre of the international monetary system (the gold standard) and, through its navy, ensured that global seaborne trade was safe from piracy. And the post-1945 era could be dubbed the “pax Americana” as the US supported its European (and Japanese allies) both militarily and economically. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the post-Mao change in Chinese economic policy brought most of the world into the global trading system.
Might we see another great reversal? There is little evidence of it in the data so far. But the rhetoric is headed in one direction: sanctions on Russia, tariffs on China and a determination in many countries, after the pandemic, to ensure that some strategically important goods are produced at home. The recent sabre-rattling of China over Taiwan might be an indicator of the next tipping point.
The second threat to co-operation lies in domestic politics. In part, this stems from globalisation which is perceived in many western countries as being good for the highly-educated elite but bad for ordinary workers. There has definitely been a slowdown in the growth rate of real earnings of the average worker in recent decades and in most countries, rising inequality. There is a vigorous debate among economists as to the causes of this shift with technological change playing at least as big a role as globalisation.
But this sluggish growth in real incomes has broken the contract between politicians and the people they govern, in which votes are supplied in return for increased prosperity. That has fuelled the disillusionment with politicians that was the subject of an earlier book of mine, The Last Vote. This discontent has meant constraints in democracy in some countries where its roots are shallow, such as Russia and Hungary. And in western countries it has led to the rise of “nativist” politicians like Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen, who imply that a “globalist” elite is plotting to undermine their countries.
How serious is this threat? It is easy to forget that Donald Trump lost the popular vote in both 2016 and 2020, taking office only because of the vagaries of the electoral college system. But his attempt to cling on to office in 2020 showed how tenuous are the institutional supports for democracy in the US; it was only the honesty of a few Republican officials in swing states that prevented him from stealing the election. In this category, one might add the outrageous attempt by the Conservative party to prorogue the British Parliament in 2019, a step that was blocked by the Supreme Court in an 11–0 decision.
In her book “How Civil Wars Start”, Barbara Walter details her research into the crucial factors that can cause a descent into chaos; excessive factionalism, the politics of resentment and the existence of armed groups. In particular, she refers to the existence of “anocracy” where a nominal democracy exists but the institutional structure that supports it (independent courts, a free press etc) have been undermined.
Anocracies can often descend into dictatorship, as Russia has shown. But they can head in another direction, as happened in Lebanon in the 1980s and Yugoslavia as the state’s authority disintegrates into regional and religious factions. Ms Walter is not predicting a re-enactment of the US Civil War of the 1860s, with uniformed armies fighting pitched battles, but a steady descent into chaos.
And if one looks at history, it is replete with examples of states disintegrating in the face of internal and external challenges. The western Roman empire was declining long before Rome was sacked in 410CE or Romulus Augustulus, the last emperor, was deposed in 476CE. The Hapsburg dynastic empire, steadily assembled over many centuries, disintegrated within weeks in 1918. Chaos is as likely an outcome as dictatorship.
The concept that Britain is only “four meals away from anarchy” has been used by MI5 to assess strategic risks and variations of the quote have been attributed to Lenin and the scifi writers Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. The original quote seems to have come from Alfred Henry Lewis back in 1896 who wrote” that the only barrier between us and anarchy is the last nine meals we’ve had” .
Back in the 1970s, a time when the country was rocked by high inflation, strikes and energy shortages, there was talk that Britain was “ungovernable”. There have been moments since then, notably during the riots of 2011, when the veneer of society has worn very thin.
The very connections that supply us with our food, energy and gadgets are also a source of our vulnerability, which could come in the form of embargoes, blockades or cyberattacks. Specialisation, which is at the heart of the modern economy, means that few of us have the means or the expertise to support ourselves.
Turmoil in America also affects the rest of the developed world since the post-1945 global settlement is built on the US’s economic and military strength. In 410CE, faced with Saxon incursions, the British wrote to Rome to appeal for help (according to one historical account). The emperor Honorius replied that they must look to their own defence. Isolationists in the US argue that Europe should do the same.
One can map out a future for the world in which the bonds that tie together the US and Europe disintegrate in the face of Russian and Chinese pressure, declining living standards provoke unrest at home which leads to violence on the streets, and public services break down leading to an even further decline in welfare.
This outcome is still only a possibility rather than a probability. But it is an outcome we should all consider before voting for those who would destroy the global economic structure.

I am a Student Ambassador with the University of Edinburgh. My job is to give tours of the university to visitors, prospective students and to anybody who is interested in the university. I mostly work for the department of Student Recruitment and Admissions and for Edinburgh Global, but I can be contracted by any department of the university. I am expected to help out on Open Days, School Visits, Alumni Events, teacher training sessions and on visits from International Delegations of other Universities.
On Open Days I give out leaflets, show people around the campus and just make them feel in general comfortable around the university.
In some cases I go on Schools visits either with my department of the School of Geosciences or the general student recruitment team.
Being a Student Ambassador is a real job with real pay. I even have a LinkedIn entry on it!
https://uk.linkedin.com/in/hunor-de%C3%A1k-458503121
I conduct university tours around the Central Campus/King’s Buildings, do office work, take part in student Q&A sessions, help with student support staff training, represent the university on school visits and help to organise/run university Open Days. I work for the Student Recruitment & Admissions, Edinburgh Global and Go Abroad Edinburgh.
Student Ambassadors are the face of the University of Edinburgh to prospective students, their parents/carers and teachers/advisers. The Student Ambassador team consists of 75 students, both UG and PG, from a range of Schools, Colleges, backgrounds and nationalities. The scheme is primarily designed to support the work of the Student Recruitment and Admissions Team and Edinburgh Global, however, from time to time Student Ambassadors have the opportunity to work for a range of other departments from around the University.
This is the official spiel. Looked over by university officials and decided in advance. To be honest I don’t really like this description, as it removes the honesty from my work.
In reality being a student ambassador is so much more than a job! It is a gift and an experience.
I get to work with a diverse range of people, and a diverse age range of people. I showed Primary school pupils around Appleton Tower, I introduced Scottish food to new students from around the globe and helped run an event at St Cecilia’s Hall for the old Alumni who graduated with the university 40–50 years ago. As a Student Ambassador I met such a nice number of people.
I worked under the wings of so many interesting university leaders as well.
Through the scheme I met so many fellow Student Ambassadors, that if I would have a thousand hands with hundreds of fingers I wouldn’t be able to count them! I met people from St. Petersburg, Florida, Vienna, the Netherlands, south California. I saw a wide range of departments from helping to host a music night to the alumni at St Cecilia’s Hall to handing out goodie bags to the newly graduated students of the University. I have done everything from office work for ERASMUS+ to waste management and moving boxes in the dungeons.
Being a Student Ambassador helped to improve my speaking skills, trained me to work better as a member of a group and gave me a greater range of confidence.
The University of Edinburgh is an ancient Scottish institution that educated the great Men of the Scottish Enlightenment, revolutionised the world of science and produced global leaders.
The university is a warm and welcoming place where I built up lots of skills for employment.
Step into the world that is the University of Edinburgh!

Peter Drake, a teacher from Hexham in Britain, spent many years in the classroom encouraging the learning of science. In recent years, Peter has found a new path in writing, music, and the arts. Today, he uses his experience to inspire others, proving that life after teaching can be just as rewarding and full of new adventures and doesn’t need to take place in the classroom.
Some cities make an impression the moment you arrive. Others take a little time, revealing their beauty and character slowly. Edinburgh, however, is in a category all of its own — a place that doesn’t just leave an impression but sears itself into your memory, heart, and soul. For me, Edinburgh’s allure is most powerful during that extraordinary moment each year when the Edinburgh Festival Fringe transforms the city into the beating heart of global creativity.
Every August, this historic Scottish capital erupts into life, laughter, noise, and energy. Streets that are usually relatively calm thrum with a chaotic symphony of buskers, actors, dancers, musicians, and visitors from all corners of the world. Cafés spill over with animated conversation, parks host pop-up performances, and every available space — from traditional theatres to tiny basements — is pressed into service for the arts. If ever a city could wear joy like a cloak, it is Edinburgh during the Fringe.
I feel deeply connected to Edinburgh, not least because of my own unforgettable experience of the Fringe. Some years ago, my play, The Prisoner’s Friend, was performed during the festival. Seeing a piece of writing, crafted over months of quiet work, take on a new life before an audience of strangers in such a vibrant setting was a defining moment for me. There is something intoxicating about watching people react to your words — to hear them laugh, to see them fall silent with emotion, to feel that invisible thread of understanding stretch between stage and audience. For anyone who has created, performed, or even simply spectated during the Fringe, the memory leaves an indelible mark.
During that month, the city itself becomes more than just a backdrop; it feels like an active participant in the festival. The ancient streets and winding closes seem to lean in, listening. The grand, stern buildings of the New Town provide a dramatic stage set, while the narrow, atmospheric lanes of the Old Town whisper history and secrets around every corner. There’s a profound sense that Edinburgh is uniquely suited to house such an explosion of creativity — a city proud of its culture, deeply aware of its own myths and legends, yet refreshingly willing to let loose and celebrate the new.
Of course, part of what makes the Fringe experience so powerful is the sense of freedom it offers. Nowhere else in the world can so many performers, both seasoned professionals and complete beginners, share space so democratically. Whether your production has a massive budget or is fueled solely by passion and a few hand-painted posters, the Fringe offers a platform. It is, at heart, a celebration of taking a risk, of putting yourself and your art in front of the world without guarantees or safety nets.
That spirit permeated everything during the time I spent there. Days were crammed with rehearsals, flyering on the Royal Mile, frantic last-minute set changes, and post-show discussions in packed pubs. Nights were filled with laughter, new friendships, and a thrilling sense of community. For one glorious month, you become part of a tribe — a massive, sprawling, creative tribe that welcomes anyone willing to leap into the unknown.
I often think about those August days and nights, and the way they stand in contrast to the quieter months when the festival has packed up and the city breathes a little easier. Yet even outside of August, Edinburgh remains magnificent. Climb Arthur’s Seat for a panoramic view of a city that seamlessly marries medieval and modern. Walk through the peaceful elegance of the Georgian New Town, with its perfectly symmetrical streets and squares. Explore the mysteries of the Old Town, where narrow closes and hidden courtyards make you feel as though you might step into another century.
And always, whether it’s August or April, the city’s commitment to culture shines through. From the National Museum of Scotland to the Scottish National Gallery, from the historic libraries to the storytelling centres, Edinburgh is a place where history, art, and ideas are not just preserved but celebrated.
For me personally, the emotional connection to Edinburgh will always be anchored in that heady, transformative experience of the Fringe. It’s not just about the performances or the audiences — it’s about being part of something larger than yourself. It’s about feeling, even for a brief time, that you are contributing to a shared celebration of imagination, creativity, and human connection.
Every year when August rolls around, I feel a twinge of longing. I picture the crowds gathering, the pop-up stages going up, the laughter echoing down the cobbled streets. I imagine first-time performers nervously stepping onto stages, writers seeing their characters come to life, audiences discovering unexpected delights in hidden venues.
Few who have performed at the Fringe ever forget it. The highs are high, the lows can be humbling, but the memories are golden. Whether your show draws a full house or plays to a handful, whether you win awards or simply win the respect of your peers, the experience changes you. It reminds you that art matters. That risk matters. That connection — raw, real, immediate connection — is what we all crave, and occasionally, in a special place like Edinburgh during the Fringe, we find it.
In a world that sometimes feels increasingly fragmented and divided, that spirit of celebration and connection feels more precious than ever. And so I will always hold Edinburgh close — not just as a stunning city of history and beauty, but as a place where, for a brief, shining moment, anything feels possible.

“This is a city of shifting light, of changing skies, of sudden vistas. A city so beautiful it breaks the heart again and again.”
― Alexander McCall Smith
As the sun rises, I watch the city of Edinburgh slowly revealed… a dark foggy nothingness giving way to a thousand rooftops accented by a spire here and there, dark and unfocused at first, but gradually taking on shape, form, and color. Finally, the edge of the sun peeks over the horizon and dazzling light spills into and across the room, putting a sudden and audible end to muffled conversations.
The bride and groom touch, and she whispers something softly into his ear. Both turn to look out the open window. On the table beside them, a once-full bottle of fine malt, a dozen empty glasses, and a stone jug of spring water sit where they were last touched.
“Wow… Look at that!” from the kilted man wearing the splendid red uniform tunic.
I have no words to adequately describe the scene being painted below as the sun continues its steady, lazy morning stretch, revealing a hilltop here, a wisp of smoke from a chimney there, the ancient castle perched to our left, and the blue ocean in the distance bathed…

Let’s all collectively ignore that this article is late (I need a lot of grace these days 😭)
Hi guys! It’s been a HOT minute (ironically😅). I know, I take full responsibility for my prolonged absence. The past several months have been a lot; mentally, emotionally, and physically. I can only say thank God for His grace through it all.
I have a lot to say and so much gist for you guys
The first thing I’d like to share is the different aspects of my first half-year on the other side of the globe.
Transportation
One of my favourite things about living here is the transportation system. Gone are the days of fighting passengers to enter a bus and fighting bus conductors for change. The transportation system I have experienced here (mostly buses) is more comfortable and seamless.
Most buses I’ve used are double-decker with an upper level for passengers to sit. Bus fares are paid with exact amounts, prepaid bus cards, free bus travel cards, or contactless payment methods. And yes, I said free bus travel. Scotland has free bus travel for under 22s, over 60s and disabled travellers.
There are accessibility accommodations on buses such as designated seats for elderly travellers, disabled travellers, and people with buggies.
For the most part, you don’t have to wait endlessly for the bus. Bus delays are often communicated on electronic displays at bus stops and Google Maps (which is usually more accurate). Any changes in bus stops or bus routes are well communicated to passengers in advance.
Besides the buses, there are trams and trains, modes of transportation that I wasn’t familiar with before living here. Cycling is also a thing here (I’ve even tossed around the idea of getting a bicycle a few times).
Since being here, I have learnt to embrace walking as part of my everyday life. These days a 21-minute walk is just a nice little exercise. The roads are well-designed to accommodate pedestrian traffic and motorists obey traffic rules, so I no longer have hypertension whenever I cross the road.
Compared to how clueless I was when I first arrived, I’ve largely settled into making my way downtown, walkin’ fast faces pass and I’m home-bound (tadadadadada). Ma da mi loun, I’m not a serious geh😜
Every once in a while though, I miss the thrill of rushing around and the fun of Danfo drama, I’m a Lagos girl after all.
Advice: Wear comfortable shoes, walking becomes a part of you
Weather
The stark difference in weather has been the most jarring part of moving to Edinburgh. I’ve never lived in a place with four actual seasons before and it’s an experience I can’t fully express. So far, I’ve experienced Winterrrr 🥶, gorgeous Spring, Summer (ish), and Autumn-yet to be decided.
Winter almost broke me😭
It was cold, or as the wobble-headed narrator of the Oversimplified YouTube channel says “STUPID COLD!” I made many a perilous journey to and from class, but like they say, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger 💪🏽. I held out hope every freezing day, for the relief of a warm summertime that everyone seemed to eagerly expect.
UNFORTUNATELY, it was all a SCAM! 😭
Spring was cold, Summer was cold, Autumn is COLD.
Oh, and apart from the low temperatures, there are wind speeds that go over vehicle speed limits and rains that appear out of nowhere. It is a fascinating experience.
Am I used to it? I don’t think it’s something to get used to honestly. I want to get used to nice things; like someone spending money on me, living a baby girl lifestyle, you know, nice things.
Advice: Expect any weather, and always carry an umbrella
The Environment, The People
Scotland is beautiful and Edinburgh is stunning.
As erratic as the weather can be here, the skies are a deep and beautiful shade of blue, the sun (when it decides to grace us with its presence) shoots down golden rays to illuminate the greenery, and on the rarest of occasions, I have seen the most perfectly coloured rainbows adorn a pale-bright sky.
The city is a spectacular landscape surrounded by hills and dotted with the most luscious trees and shrubs. Breathtaking (see Exhibit A below). Exploring Edinburgh’s rich scenery, heritage and uniqueness deserves a post of its own (coming soon? fingers crossed)
Now for the people.
At this point, I’m pretty sure Scottish people don’t speak English. They speak a language only they can understand. Fair warning: if you can understand English, don’t expect to automatically understand Scottish English.
Picture this: You go to eat at a fancy with a whole bar section for drinks. You look at the list of nice-sounding beverages and decide you're too broke (for now) to afford them, so you walk up to the bar and ask for a glass of water. You’re greeted with a smile and a nod. “This is going well.” you think as the bartender fills a glass with tap water (don’t worry, it’s clean). You’re about to stretch your hand when the bartender asks “Dyu like some aeyce?” Now you’re lost. “What is aeyce?” “Does it cost extra?” “How do I respond?”.
The bartender senses the activation of your flight-freeze response and points at the ice bucket next to the counter. Ice. He’s asking if you want ice 🤦🏽‍♀️
Excuse me for that long scenario, I haven’t written fiction in a while and I quite enjoyed that.
Back to the story.
Their weird rendition of English aside, I see Scottish people like regular people, with the good and the not-so-good. There’s a general “mind your business” vibe here which isn’t necessarily good or bad. However, seeing some of the effects of this way of life has made me appreciate that the cultural system of community involvement in personal and interpersonal matters can be quite valuable.
Edinburgh is full of people from all over the world, which is expected of any tourist city. Going from a racially homogenous place like Nigeria to a vastly multicultural hub like this is like exploring a whole new world. I have heard many new languages, seen many new faces and experienced many new cultures.
Side note: I finally ate Chinese, Indian and Italian food; it was all delicious, you should try them too.
Community (Nigerian shops, Nigerian students, Nigerian food)
This probably goes without saying, but there are Nigerians in Edinburgh. There are Nigerian grocery shops and hairstylists in Edinburgh. Just as in places like London and Manchester, there is a flourishing Nigerian community in Edinburgh.
When I arrived at my school, I was surprised to be surrounded by Nigerians in class and at the hostel. In some ways, it felt like I never left Nigeria. Ironically, I have learnt more about Nigeria in Edinburgh than I ever learnt in Nigeria.
Having a community of people who can relate to my perspective is refreshing. I’ve made some great friends here who are simply amazing.
Side note: I’ve also made friends from other countries; trust me, it’s not as hard as it seems.
I’m loving my time here in Edinburgh, and getting that nice abroad weight gain (no exhibits here). I’ll share more about my life in Edinburgh as time goes on. Let me know any specific things you want me to talk about😊.
I’ll try not to disappear for too long next time. Thank you for your constant support and patience. I love you guys!

Since 2016, Edinburgh council has slowly been rolling out on-street storage for cyclists. In the last year, the number of hangars has doubled from 100 to over 200.
64% of Edinburgh households live in flats, and we know that finding somewhere to store a bicycle is one of the more important barriers to people moving around on two wheels. With about 300,000 people in capital in such a predicament, and with 6 spots per cycle hangar… you can do the maths.
One hangar location near Stockbridge has 142 people on the waiting list.
It is therefore not a surprise that the new hangars are massively over-subscribed. The waiting list has grown to 3,400, including those in the queue for an existing hangar and those who have requested one.
This latent demand for cycling is being realised, and in a big way. As new hangars go in they become a visible part of our public realm and more and more people become aware of them.
As things stand, the council will need to install a further 560 hangars to meet demand. Over 1,000 people joined the queue in the last year or so; if replicated this year, that’s another 170 hangars required on top of that.
Yet the council only has plans for around another 160.
Each cycle hangar takes up the space taken by one car. Parking permits are a significant source of revenue for the council. But so are cycle hangars…
At full price, a cycle hangar spot costs £72 per year. That compares favourably with car parking, which is either free in most of the city, or £36.50 for a zero carbon emissions car (except in the very centre of the city, where it’s £73.70).
Taking that £36.50 figure, each hangar will generate 12 times as much revenue as a car parking spot. That doesn’t take into account maintenance costs of the hangars, but after all the negative externalities associated with cars… it’s a good investment.
Indeed, if the council were a private business, they’d push those prices up even higher to meet demand.
Cycle hangars have been so far placed in the more prosperous parts of the city; Marchmont, Newington, Bruntsfield, Portobello — you get the picture. This is efficient work from the council as most of the demand for the cycle hangars is located in these areas.
However, conscious of the social inequity of providing such infrastructure in only the richer parts of town, a number of hangars have been located in areas of high deprivation. Even better, these are provided at a subsidised cost of only £1.50 a month.
This has not been successful. Some of these hangars are those few that have not been populated by bicycles. It is my view that the barriers to cycling for those on the lowest incomes remain the relatively large capital investment associated with the bicycle itself. The low cost and low risk associated with Lothian Buses’ excellent service is difficult to beat.
An interactive map of hangars, waiting lists and demand can be found here: LINK
This article has been based on a Freedom of Information request to Edinburgh City Council, which you can find here: LINK
While there is precise location data for existing hangars, requests for hangars are made on a street-by-street basis. I have used the postcode associated with each street and used the centroid of that postcode area to map requests.

I stood at the gated entrance on Candlemaker Row of the 16th-century Greyfriars Kirkyard. The wind whipped the leafless trees, and the sky threatened to rain. The weather was suitable for exploring a graveyard, especially one that proclaims to be the most haunted graveyard in the world in one of the most haunted cities, Edinburgh, Scotland.
Although I had not been there before, there was something familiar about the place as soon as I walked in.
It was my second visit to Edinburgh, and this time, I returned in January when the hordes of tourists were gone. I had seen the city’s most well-known sights, like Edinburgh Castle, Holyrood Palace, and the Royal Mile, which left me free to explore lesser-known places.
Greyfriars Kirkyard piqued my interest as I read a list of suggested things to do in Edinburgh. The graveyard was established during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots, and was full of victims from the Black Plague and the witch hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries, in which around four thousand…

Hello again from my work world developing a new ten-year fund for communities in Edinburgh to work together as part of a wider system to work in regenerative ways to get deep into the root causes of big issues in our city— poverty, racism and climate change.
I’ve never written as consistently about one topic before — this is my 15th blog in a series about developing Regenerative Futures Fund, with another 4 in there about Funding Utopias.
In April 2024 my writing was about Inching Closer to Launch, closing off and reflecting on our wonderful co-design groups.
In September 2024 I mused about Good Hosting, Floating and Anchoring, when I was feeling grateful for all who supported the more ‘behind the scenes things’ — WHALE Arts, EVOC and Foundation Scotland.
And then more recently I reflected on working with poets on our Collective Imagination programme and our beautiful poetry anthology All That Is Needed Is A Dream.
So — here is my more general Regenerative Futures Fund update for the second half of 2024 and first part of 2025🌿
This was also shared on our Regenerative Futures Fund ‘News & Notes’ section in February 2025 — a PDF of the update copied below can be downloaded here.
1. Fund Design — Process, Participation & Programme
2. Recruitment and Team Development
3. Communications and Open Working
4. Governance Ecosystem (and Hosting)
5. Fundraising and Contracting
6. Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability and Learning (MEAL)
7. Field Building & Systems — Learning Partnerships, Sharing the Model
If anything chimes, please do get in touch
Please do get in touch if you have any questions or you’d like to get involved: Leah Black (Co-Head) — leah@foundationscotland.org.uk

Edinburgh’s charm is so idyllic, it’s been a muse to writers for centuries. It’s only fitting that this is where the Kimpton Charlotte Square sits, a serene hideaway, full to overflowing with everything needed for a romantic escape. I recently stayed two nights there on a wedding anniversary tour of Edinburgh where I found four reasons why this hotel is the most romantic in the city.
Follow the author to be notified when new luxury travel articles are published.
Close your eyes and imagine a scene from a classic piece of literature (one of the cheerier volumes). What you dreamed up likely comes very close to the Kimpton Charlotte Square. A wicker basket props up black Mary Poppins umbrellas next to a stately Georgian door. Red bicycles fitted with silver bells patiently wait for their next outing on a herringbone tile floor. A dancing fire in a massive stone fireplace warms the room and the mood. A couple chats animatedly in the library and garden greenery weaves its way from the outdoors in, bringing a taste of a summer garden with it. This was what greeted us as we explored the common rooms on our first night. Even story settings don’t get as romantic as this.
On our second night, we decided to take a dip in the indoor swimming pool. There’s nothing like a spontaneous swim, taken purely for fun (with no attempt to get a workout in) to bring up memories of the exciting first rush of love. Do try it.
When the day draws you and your love outside, Edinburgh is at your feet, literally. Kimpton Charlotte Square is in New Town (built between 1767 and 1890 while Old Town is medieval). Shops full of Harris Tweed tartan handbags and beautifully packaged shortbread biscuits, plus one-of-a-kind treasures are two to ten minutes away on foot. Edinburgh wasn’t bombed as badly as London was during WW2, so the gorgeous period architecture is laid out in unbroken ribbons along the city’s cobbled streets. The baked goods in Edinburgh are second-to-none. If you’ve never tried chocolate and caramel-topped millionaire shortbread, you haven’t lived. Don’t miss out; it will transform your expectations of dessert forever. Cabs or buses are plentiful when it’s time to go to Old Town. Or, if you don’t mind a very scenic walk, Old Town can be reached in about 20 minutes on foot. As you’re bound to get distracted constantly by fabulous shops and scenery, plan for more.
Discovering a tin full of goodies in the room was my first delightful foodie surprise. Rich chocolate bars and well-chosen savoury snacks fed my habit of late-night snacking on both nights of our stay. Even better was dinner on our second night. We ate our fill at BABA, a restaurant that feels like the best version of a Middle Eastern bazaar. BABA is a vibrantly hued maze of open areas that buzz with conversation, and intimate tables framed with heavy velvet curtains, made for a quiet meal. My hummus and pita bread was so wonderful, I nearly skipped to dessert. I’m glad I didn’t though, as the cod with grilled celeriac and cashews was tender and flavourful. My husband had the pork with red pepper ketchup, feta cheese and banana chilies, which he must have loved as he cleaned his plate.
For variety, there are two other restaurants on-site, Aizle (featuring a six-course tasting menu) and The Garden, a scenic, light-filled café that serves coffee and sandwiches until 3 PM.
After dinner and a day of exploration, I craved a hot shower and soft bed. I got both in our beautiful one-bedroom partitioned suite that overlooked the front steps of the hotel and Charlotte Square beyond. The suite’s sitting room and bedroom are separated by a partial wall under a high ceiling. Of all the room’s brilliant décor, I liked the drawing of wily rabbits best — its outright whimsy juxtaposed nicely with the downy velvet drapes and refined upholstered sofa. The super king bed’s duvet was so nice — crisp, spotless, and had just the right weight. Snuggling under it while watching TV and reliving our day surrounded by a beautiful room full of beautiful things was wonderful and terribly romantic.
As I write this, I want to go back and package up the room to bring home and make ours, but I suppose the fantasy needs to stay in Edinburgh where it fits to tailor-made perfection.
The Kimpton Charlotte Square is a fantastic hotel in a city that falls in my top three world-wide. I particularly recommend the hotel to couples looking for a romantic getaway as it is the most romantic hotel in Edinburgh. Tip: For access to the best selection of room types and seasonal specials, book directly on Kimpton Charlotte Square’s official website.
It wasn’t until I caught sight of the building that I realised I had been a guest of the hotel before, years ago. At that time it had another name. I am delighted with the improvements Kimpton has made. I liked the hotel very much before, but it is even better now, particularly in the areas of interior design and cuisine. Kudos to Kimpton!
My gratitude to Naomi Cameron of 3x1 for expertly arranging my time at the hotel. Thank you, Naomi! You’re a credit to your company.

On my way out of Edinburgh I stopped for my final EB in the land of kilts, sporrans, and Harris Tweed. My suitcase was bulging with Scotch Whiskey miniatures, a framed picture of puffins, and a natty little hat that would absolutely suit the Canberra winter, but not the Scottish Summer.
I was catching the train from Edinburgh Station down to Guildford to see my Dad before flying home to Aussie. Being so close, six hours of trains, I couldn’t possibly pass up the chance to pop in. My train wasn’t until 11am, so PLENTY of time to feast first.
I had seen the menu in the window a few days before on one of my walks and decided it looked like the sort of place that would either do a really good EB or monumentally stuff it up by trying to be too innovative.
I was seated in a booth with a brass topped table, and green velvet seats which I sank into. Looking around, there was nary a hard chair in the joint. Even the wooden dining chairs had a plush cushion to rest the weary buttocks.
I ordered a latte, orange juice, and classic Eggs Benedict that included Ayrshire Smoked Bacon, Toasted Muffin, Poached Eggs, Hollandaise Sauce. The menu kept it simple, so I thought, it going to be plain and simple.
It wasn’t, of course it wasn’t. I was in the Grand Cafe. They had the date on either side of the name. 1905. The chandeliers sparkled. The stained glass was clean. The stairs marble.
It came on a hand-turned ceramic plate, with spotlessly clean, shiny, cutlery (flatware, for the Americans). Baby spinach and toasted onion flakes adorned as garnish. The sauce, while pale, WAS HOUSE MADE!
Hallelujah.
I’ll be honest. I devoured it. It looked appetising, smelled fabulous, and tasted tangy with lemon as the acid in the sauce. The eggs, which I forgot to photograph because I was too busy scoffing them, where cooked to perfection with golden yolks and no egg snot.
After I had eaten, I used a few drinks mats to write some tanka about my Edinburgh stay. A couple of days before I had bunked off the conference to go and see some wildlife in the wild.

When you walk the charming cobbled streets of Edinburgh’s Old Town, it’s easy to fall in love with the history. The gothic spires. The storytellers. The whiskey.
But beneath your feet lies another version of the city — one that most people don’t talk about unless they’re on a ghost tour.
One that’s still very much alive in its own way.
Welcome to the Edinburg Vaults, a network of stone chambers built in the late 1700s beneath South Bridge. They were meant for businesses and storage. But the vaults were dark, damp, and poorly ventilated — so they were quickly abandoned.
But not forgotten.
Soon after, the city’s poorest moved in. Families without homes, criminals, the sick, the unwanted.
People lived — and died — in these cold, airless rooms.
Disease spread quick. Murders went unnoticed.
And when the authorities eventually sealed the vaults, many believe they buried more than just stone and wood. They buried people alive.

Liberal Arts Blog — Friday is the Joy of Art, Architecture, Design, Film, and All Things Visual Day
Today’s Topic: Edinburgh: Raphael, “The Holy Family,” Velazquez “Old Lady Frying Eggs,” and Church “Niagara”
Last week, Vienna. Two weeks ago, Stockholm. Three weeks ago, Moscow. This week, Edinburgh — as we continue the tour of European art galleries to which I have never been. The first of today’s picks is from the Italian Renaissance, the second from the Spanish Golden Age, and the third from the Hudson River School of mid-19th century America. Experts — please chime in. Correct, elaborate, elucidate.
RAPHAEL (1483–1520) “The Holy Family with the Palm Tree” (1506)
1. What is most striking about this scene is the prominence of Joseph.
2. Most Holy Family scenes have a focus on Jesus or Mary.
3. Can any experts provide any enlightenment on this score?
NB: Raphael is most famous for “The School of Athens” — one of four frescoes in the “Stanza della Segnatura” in the Apostolic Museum in the Vatican in Rome. Tragically, he died young, allegedly from too much sex, on Good Friday, 1520, which was, according to Vasari, also his birthday.
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Raphael_The_Holy_Family_with_a_Palm_Tree.jpg
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael
DIEGO VELAZQUEZ (1599–1660) “Old Lady Frying Eggs” (1618) — “chiaroscuro” and photographic realism
1. The eggs look like fried eggs from a distance but if you look closely you will see that they are swimming in a liquid and are probably better described as poached.
2. Case study in “chiaroscuro” — “with a strong light source coming in from the left illuminating the woman, her utensils and the poaching eggs, while throwing the background and the boy standing to her right into deep shadow. Here the chiaroscuro is very intense, so much so that it would be impossible to see the wall at the bottom of the painting but for the basket hanging from it; it simultaneously manages to combine the murky darkness and high contrasts of light and shadow with the use of subtle hues and a palette dominated by ochres and browns. The composition is organized as an oval with the middle figures in the nearest plane, thus drawing in the viewer.”
3. “The realism is nearly photographic and shows everyday plates, cutlery, pans, pestles, jugs and mortars, capturing the special shine on a glass surface and the light’s play on the melon carried by the boy. The boiling pan is particularly well-captured, with its reflections and the whites of the eggs. Velázquez also worked particularly hard on the detail of the two figures’ hands.”
NB: Velazquez was the great painter of the second half of the “Spanish Golden Age” (the “Siglo de Oro”) under the reign of Philip IV (1605–1665). El Greco (1541–1641) — was the master of the first half under Philip II (1527–1598).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Woman_Frying_Eggs
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez
FREDERICK CHURCH (1826–1900) “Niagara Falls, from the American Side” (1867)
1. Church was a member of the “Hudson River School” of American artists. Their theme was “sublime” nature and the “awe” it inspires.
2. Nothing captures this theme better than Niagara Falls which became a metaphor for the “manifest destiny” of the United States.
3. This is Church’s largest painting (8 feet by 7 feet) and the only one of his paintings in a European collection.
NB: Church’s most influential rendering of Niagara (from the Canadian side) was painted ten years earlier. See second link below.

That the love of typewriters is a thing, becomes evident from Somsubhra Banerjee’s article that inspired this one. Such passion for outdated technology does not come naturally to me. Yet, I came to appreciate the charming appearance of typewritten verse in 2022 after my visit to Typewronger Books in Edinburgh, Scotland.
It was not love at first sight. I slowly descended the steps to an unpretentious-looking bookstore’s entrance. In true Harry Potteresque style that is so characteristic of Edinburgh, Scotland, the “entrance” gave away absolutely nothing. I might as well have opened what looked like a basement door and found myself in Diagon Alley on the other side!
Little did I know, that I would spend the next two hours with family rummaging through entertaining accounts written by independent writers, some graduates of the University of Edinburgh’s famous creative writing programs, and many other intriguing but unknown gems. Well, that shouldn’t be surprising in the world’s first city designated as a “City of Literature” by UNESCO.
It turns out that this bookstore specialises in selling, but also repairing old typewriters. That someone would take the pains to get an old dysfunctional typewriter repaired for a cost sounded absurd to me.
The book wizard at the front desk was kind enough to share snippets of how many writers still prefer to write on typewriters. Or how he has a typewriter there which when my daughter click-clacked, would generate a tweet! And, how he had sold metres and metres of books as “home office decoration” during the great golden age of Zoom (2020–22)!
What fascinated me the most, however, was how captivated I was with all the typewriters they had on display. Turquoise, mint green, plain white but also the classic grandfather typewriters — black with black keys and golden alphabets etched on them.
Since that rainy afternoon, seeing typewritten words on the paper now mesmerises me. Those stark black and white angular letters seem to have a personality of their own. Have you read verses of poetry that just feel more alive on Instagram because they are typewritten? There is magic in them. If I can now see it, could this be some kind of literary spiritual awakening I underwent at Typewronger?
Typewriters haven’t gone completely out of fashion despite their more sophisticated and user-friendly competitors such as laptops and tablets. Surprisingly, they have held on to their niche and achieved cult status. It makes me wonder if some part of our current less efficient, cumbersome, but infinitely more charming and deeper way of writing, will unexpectedly preserve itself despite the advent of easier, lazier AI tools. Anyway, I digress…
It makes me wonder why. Perhaps, a typewriter, the way it feels to exert your fingers on its keys and the resulting click-clack sound allows a writer to feel like a music composer. After all, music is just a more mystical form of writing, isn’t it?
Or does it allow her to take on the identity of Hemingway, or perhaps, Anne Lamott, as types away? Similar to the purpose a bottle of rum would serve, or perhaps, an old, white, soft-beyond-description t-shirt. Is it a getting-into-character exercise for literary minds? Or does it evoke nostalgia for a lost, golden era of literature that she painfully tries to access, but only through its relics — typewriters?
Who knows? Do tell me if you give writing on a typewriter a shot one fine day. And if you were to bust it, you now know where to get it repaired!

It is Festival season in Edinburgh. Tens of thousands of visitors have flocked in the city, from everywhere, many from abroad. The streets are crowded, buses cannot keep to their schedules, and most people react to the misery of long queues and delays cheerfully. I think there is the acceptance that if one wished to live in one of the most civilised cities in Europe, there must be a small price to pay. Coming out of the Assembly, where I had been to watch The Life and Times of Michael K, based on J.M.Coetzee’s novel, it was nearly 3.00 p.m. and I had not had lunch yet. So when I reached the bus stop just outside the Central Library, my heart sank when I saw a long queue waiting. I checked the electronic indicator, and was not surprised that it was not in operation, and therefore had no information about how long a wait there would be. An elderly lady, a sprightly nonagenarian, next to whom I found myself caught the little grimace I made, and nodded at me in sympathy, and I thought that to pass the time, one could indulge in a little conversation. You’ve been to a show, ma’am? I asked. Her eyes twinkled, as no doubt she too welcomed a chat to pass the time. No, she responded, but she was at the Usher Hall last night to catch that Korean orchestra playing Mozart. Was it good? I asked. It was superlative, she said, but had more to say.
‘I marvel at these people who are open to an alien culture and produce such excellent work,’ she said, ‘and ask myself, What do we know of Asian culture?’ Yes, I responded, the Koreans, like the Japanese and the Chinese, are excellent interpreters of Western classical music. Had I seen any good shows this year? She asked. I told her about Michael K, and added that I too had seen a delightful Korean opera, Trojan Woman, and said that it was one of the best shows that I had caught in the last few years.Yes, she said, they are a very cultured people. I then thought I should pay her a compliment.
‘I am surprised and pleased that you think so,’ I said.
‘But I was born in Penang,’ she blurted out, ‘my father was district officer in the thirties.’ And she told me that she had lived in Malaya until she was twelve, and then spent time in Jakarta as well. To my surprise she revealed that she used to be fluent in bahasa. My son was in Bogor for two or three years, I said, teaching TEFL. I had to add that my father too had spent time in Indonesia in the twenties.
Suddenly her eyes lit up again, and she said, ‘Oh I have to tell you this, it’s so marvellous.’ She had been shopping, and when it was time to pay, realised that she did not have her purse any more. She was upset and panicking, and to her amazement a young fellow came towards her brandishing her purse, which he had picked down the road. ‘Aren’t people marvellous?’ I had to tell her my own story of how, travelling from Lagos to Kontagora, a 15 hour journey I realised that I too had lost my purse.
‘I informed the driver, and he made an announcement, and someone stood up and walked towards me with my purse. Is it yours?’
‘So you must have travelled a fair bit too?’ I nodded, and told her that I came from Mauritius_’
That’s where the dodo came from?
The dodo and me, I added facetiously.
‘Oh,’ she asked suddenly, I know it’s a stupid question, but seeing you come from Mauritius, do you know dentist Chong Kwan? He used to be my dentist until last year when he sadly passed away.’ I had heard the name in Mauritius, and besides I remember my dentist brother talking about a dentist Chong Kwan. I figured out that her dentist Chong Kwan must have been the son of my brother’s colleague.
And I filled her in on what I had done since I came to the UK in 1959. Then a Number 27 bus appeared.
‘Now that I’ve been enjoying talking to you, I’d have been happy to wait some more,’ she said. Although I was quite hungry, I agreed with her.
‘Hope we can find seats together,’ she said, ‘because I’ve been enjoying our talk.’
Sadly, as the bus was fairly packed, she found a seat in front and I at the back. It seemed like an anti-climax, but two stops down her neighbour alighted, and I was able to move in with her. We continued together until Tollcross, where we both got out, she having decided to walk home, whilst I too tired to walk opted for another bus.
‘I’ll look out for you, and you do the same, we’re bound to meet again,’ she said cheerfully.

From Abuja to Edinburgh: my 1st semester experience as a Mastercard Foundation Scholar at the University of Edinburgh,https://medium.com/@mirabellemorah/from-abuja-to-edinburgh-my-1st-semester-experience-as-a-mastercard-foundation-scholar-at-the-80b3fc2ec550,"Sign up

This will humorously walk you through some of my experiences these past 3 months as a Scholar, from settling into Edinburgh to being blown away by heavy winds. See the end for scholarship application tips.
My first few weeks in the UK were both exciting and uneasy.
The Mastercard Foundation team at the University of Edinburgh have been incredible and helpful in everything. Once I got the scholarship, they guided me in applying to the university, gave travel guidance (before arriving) and helped me settle-in (on arrival).
Before I moved to start my postgrad, the past months were not easy. I experienced an armed robbery attack in the middle of the night (funny part in hindsight was that the first thing I hid was my passport). I went from that to being exhausted in the months that followed, to overthinking, etc. So arriving in Scotland, jumping into a new environment, new system and getting used to the pattern and methods of postgraduate lectures were not things I immediately settled into. It took two months for my beating heart to calm down. As they say, it’s not (only) the situation that makes you unhappy; your thoughts about it count.
I’ve explored several places in Scotland. We had a calming retreat at the Burn in Glenesk, Brechin. I visited the University of St. Andrews to watch a Rugby Match (both courtesy of Mastercard Foundation). Then I visited Glasgow to spend an evening with Gerry Higgins (Social Enterprise World Forum’s founder), his family, and Maeve Curtin.
Before Edinburgh (UK), I’d already visited circa 12/13 countries, but I’ve never been used to the transport systems of many places. So I’m slowly learning (because I walk to most of my destinations) to use Edinburgh’s public transportation, from trams to trains to buses.
As a Nigerian, you know all that hassle of looking for how to convert your naira to USD and how to buy stuff on Amazon or pay for some Apple subscription etc? Nah! That stuff is hectic abeg! It was a relief to get a multi-currency card in the UK that allowed me access different currencies. I could use a Revolut card to buy groceries in the UK with GBP and use it in the Netherlands to move around in EUR. Nice stuff.
An imaginary bank card I designed for “Bank of Womandla”. This was inspired by my course on Entrepreneurial Finance as well as one of my professors, Francis Green who encouraged us to imagine borrowing from “Bank of Francis” to fund our business ideas.
Using MTN? Remember to keep your MTN line. Here’s how.
You must find your own way of learning and dealing with course load. My postgraduate studies are on innovation and entrepreneurship, and before attending lectures and seminars, I need to read several papers. Some things that help me are to:
“This presentation was led by a fantastic first speaker who really nailed the presentation of the pitch. Ably supported by the second speaker, the pitch presentation was authoritative and slick. The video was really helpful in that it showed that attention had been given to how the pitch was to be presented…”
– Part of the academic feedback we received
Naturally, the Mastercard Scholars programme is already a HUGE community and network. The Foundation’s team organises several leadership lab sessions for scholars to learn. A Chevening scholar once attended an end-of-year event I co-organised with Kish (my fellow scholar representative) and said he liked the community we had amongst us. I’ve always believed in the power of mutually connecting with people beyond my studies, learning from others, sharing knowledge and strategically showing up for things.
So far:
I’ve been in the UK for 3 months. I haven’t seen snow in my part of Edinburgh (yet). The wind has tried to blow me away several times. I don’t know how to use a vending machine yet. I make better illustrations now. I’m better at making business valuations. And one of my favourite actions remains to keep asking more questions.
I am a huge advocate for rest. I budget heavy doses of rest and sleep in between all of my hard work. I believe in “less is more.” I believe in prayers and mindfulness. I believe in play, and in disconnecting to recharge.
P.S. for the title, no I didn’t live in Abuja. I flew out of Nigeria, from Abuja to Edinburgh.

Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, is very recognized, I would say, for its fascinating history and breathtaking architecture. It’s obviously also the perfect jumping-off point for seeing Scotland’s lovely scenery and cute towns. For anyone wanting to sneak away for a bit, there actually are a handful of cracking half day trips from Edinburgh where you can see Scotland’s highlights, so it’s almost effortless to squeeze them into your schedule. Whether you’re crazy about nature, into old stories, or very fancy seeing something a bit different, you, like your travel companions, might unearth just the thing not far from town. Let’s take a peep at, like, five ace half-day outings around Edinburgh!
Near Edinburgh, the Scottish Highlands are rather unmissable. You could grab a half-day tour, arguably offering spectacular sights featuring the mountains, lochs and valleys. This outing is truly grand, specifically for outdoorsy types and anyone needing some calm. A fair few tours drop you at spots I feel are well-known such as Loch Ness and Ben Nevis, basically to give you, like your travel partners, a glimpse of the magnificent countryside Scotland is so celebrated for.
Stirling Castle, not far from Edinburgh on the train, is so perfect for folk who find the olden days fascinating. It’s that sort of ancient fort providing views into the history of Scottish royalty because of its super well looked-after buildings and cool displays. You, like your family, could uncover the Wallace Monument, commemorating Scottish hero William Wallace, so nearby, too it’s almost too simple. Mixed together, these spots turn into an epic half-day adventure bubbling with Scottish tradition.
South Queensferry is likely just the ticket if scenic coasts grab you. Very nearby Edinburgh by car, this delightful village offers some grandstand seats looking at the Forth Bridge and the waterways dotted all around. Have a stroll on the waterfront, taste local fish at places to eat. You, like your friends, could possibly even hop on a boat for a peek at Inchcolm Island which, I guess, shows off a seriously good-condition abbey.
Another prime candidate for a half-day jolly around Edinburgh, so it seems, is the gorgeous Scottish Borders; Melrose Abbey, more precisely. This awesome ruin, built back in the 1100s, really brings home some fancy stonework coupled with some fascinating tales. Wrapped by gorgeous fields, the abbey seems grand for taking easy walks. You could perhaps peep around the amazing wee town of Melrose, known, I think, for its adorable shops and cafés.
You are likely to discover Linlithgow highly worthwhile! Loads of Scottish monarchs came into the world in its superb Linlithgow Palace, one of its claims to fame. A calming wander is made oh-so simple, very much because a lovely loch almost cuddles the palace. Loaded with stores and places to chow down, Linlithgow town alone gives a friendly spot to loosen up in, actually appreciating its character. Anyone landing here, should call in at Linlithgow railway station as Edinburgh is pretty handy that way.
Scotland’s pureness, past experiences, or culture might just show off what these first-rate half day trips from Edinburgh mean to those shy on spare time. Destinations have unique snapshots from inside Scotland that include the wonderful Highlands, or olden Stirling Castle or sweet-as-pie hamlets local to this great city. Bag-packing plus photos at the ready and it, it sounds just about time for people out of Edinburgh be discovering fantastic vistas.
Outdoor exploration hits a high through spring into summer; however changing leaf settings are extremely picturesque if seen over autumn-esque weather.
Most sites appear reachable thru public options like train travels, buses along with charted round travels. These may just come together well during quick timelines.
Quick excursions nearby could sum up as two locale stop offs throughout single half sun cycle of span in journey’s length; preferably narrow sights may have guests experience fullest joy thru focusing attention specifically one site tops!

Upon my first meal in Edinburgh, I noticed many cultural differences between the dining experience in the U.S. versus that in the U.K. We’re not talking about the food here, we’re talking about the overall atmosphere of a Scottish pub.
The dialect between Americans and Scots is very different. In both countries, the server’s job is to come up to the tables and ask if they can get you drinks or food yet, or if you need more time to decide what you’d like. At The Abbey Pub, I overheard a table with Scotts, and they had cut off the server’s spiel, by saying, “I know what I want.” In America, it would be considered rude to cut off someone’s sentence. We treat servers with more respect by waiting for them to finish speaking, then responding with, “We know what we would like!” or “I think we are ready.”
The second difference in dining etiquette is the volume at which you speak. While restaurants can be loud in America, typically, all the tables’ voices mesh and it’s just overall chatter. In a Scottish pub, some tables are quiet, and some that the Scotts are speaking very loudly, and using very intense language.

In The Abbey, there was a table near us of what appeared to be four Scotts or two couples. The women…

I was in the amazing Edinburgh Royal Botanic Gardens in April admiring the newly emerging spring daffodils when I had an epiphany, trees do in fact go to heaven, who knew!
A proponent of the daffodil is the end of life charity, Marie Curie who adopted it as their logo in 1986 offering hope, courage and support to all those who are touched by them. They started life delivering radiotherapy to women in the 30s.
She wore her yellow sun-bonnet,
She wore her greenest gown;
She turned to the south wind
And curtsied up and down.
She turned to the sunlight
And shook her yellow head,
And whispered to her neighbour:
“Winter is dead.”
Daffodowndilly, a poem by A.A. Milne
The first yellow daffodils of spring are a precious time of year for me. As A.A. Milne rightly points out they signify the end of a cold, black and white winter, a chance to wave goodbye to bad weather and offer a sense of timely rebirth with hope and a new beginning for the upcoming year.
Their arrival, a perennial gift from nature with their much-needed boost of colour is all I need from a faith, a non-spiritual conviction for me that never seems to disappoint, yellow on yellow, year on year and with impeccable timing! An unlikely yellow antidote to death, dying and goodbye!
The plant’s ‘bulbus’ (Latin) has a layer of dried skin, which serves as protection, and helps ensure that the bulb remain moist and properly insulated. There’s also another important function that it serves. Not only does this layer serve as a defence for this year’s plant, but it also carries the embryo for the plant or flower that’s going to bloom the following year.
Understanding that different kinds of daffodils follow their own pace is important. Growth primarily depends on the temperature of the soil as well as the amount of daylight that the plant receives and therefore the length of the day. Up here in Scotland we wait a month or more longer than in London where I grew up, for their arrival.
In the northern hemisphere they flower in spring and down in the southern hemisphere in our autumn, their spring. It’s magical stuff!
The daffodil plant generally thrives when the temperatures in the soil are between 50/60 degrees. As the sun begins to spend more time in the sky and the days begin to lengthen, the plant starts to grow more quickly.
Brodie Castle on the Moray Firth is one of the best places to see daffodils. They have a world-famous collection of well over 300 varieties and these always flower very late and are often at their best in late April and early May. I always enjoy a trip over to Brodie, located between Forres and Nairn just to see this yellow carnival at one of the National Trust for Scotland’s best kept secrets. Some varieties are around 150 years old like my favourite one above.
Another amazing display of yellow occurs around the same time, although with climate change it does flower from time to time all year-round, is from gorse.
Otherwise known as Whin and Furse and also Fuzzy Bush it starts its major flowering in late March and April and lasts here well into June. The overt coconut smell when in full bloom on a warm day is a very recognisable scent, one that you can also cook with if you flavour a dish with the flower petals.
It really is a ubiquitous, invasive plant in Northern Scotland especially by the coast and according to BBC’s Spring Watch; whom I tweeted this question last year, it flowers at odd times all year round simply to benefit from any early pollinators that are hanging around, out of season, who knew?
It also importantly has its own flower fairy:
When gorse is out of blossom,
(Its prickles bare of gold)
‘Then kissing’s out of fashion’,
Said country-folk of old.
Now Gorse is in its glory
In May when skies are blue,
But when its time is over,
Whatever shall we do?
O dreary would the world be,
With everyone grown cold —
Forlorn as prickly bushes
Without their fairy gold!
But this will never happen:
At every time of year
You’ll find one bit of blossom —
A kiss from someone dear!
The ‘Gorse Fairy’ is one of Cicely Mary Barker’s flower fairies that were first published in 1923.There are 170 original and individually accurate botanic illustrations, coupled with charming fairy images based on real children from Cicely’s sister’s nursery school. Each one also has a unique poem attached as above. The picture shown is on my wall at home, the verse in my book!
If you play golf on any of the world-famous links courses here, the ones played by the sea on the sand dunes and your ball lands in a gorse bush, you will have another, unmentionable name for this plant. As a rule of thumb and one which sadly missed gold commentator Peter Allis once advised, if you actually find it, take it out, drop it under penalty and ‘take your punishment son’. Never try to play it, you will regret it!
As with the daffodils, how these plants work out when to flower, never ceases to amaze me. Other yellow spring coastal gifts here are bird-foot trefoil, broom (often confused with gorse but safer!), aconites and the common dandelion.
The after-life of a tree
While once again in the Edinburgh Botanic Garden I also came across the following sign explaining how old trees that die do in fact have an ‘after-life’ or go to ‘tree heaven’ if you like. This very old sweet chestnut started to die back a few years ago and so the plant undertakers at Inverleith cut it down and left some of the main trunk in situ and the large boughs on the ground providing a habitat for other life such as bats, insects and birds.
However, this tree has suddenly lifted the lid on its coffin and surprisingly this spring, some new shoots and leaves have appeared. You can’t it seems keep a good tree down and yet another great example of nature providing hope and rebirth for the future despite looking death full in the face.
A.A. Milne — Writer and Poet
Alan Alexander Milne (1882 –1956) was a British author, poet, and playwright best known for his books about the bear Winnie-the-Pooh along with Christopher Robin, Tigger, Piglet and others. Christopher Robin was actually his son and who after a trip to the Zoo in London Milne wrote the original Winnie the Pooh story based on a tame bear, that they saw there named Winnipeg.
Milne was primarily a playwright before the massive success of Winnie-the-Pooh largely overshadowed all his previous work. Milne served in both World Wars, as a lieutenant in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment in the First World War and as a captain in the Home Guard in the Second World War. despite being a pacifist. He oddly had a degree in Maths whereby Trinity College, Cambridge, was his alma mater and was a useful cricketer. He bequeathed his original Pooh writings to the college.
Based on the fact that many of Milne’s philosophical sayings, poems and Winnie-the-Pooh quotes are often recited at funerals which I’ll come to later, he too saw the arrival of daffodils as a new beginning as per his poem at the start of this blog, added to the fact he was overtly a pacifist it seems that he did not speak out much on the subject of religion at all.
He did however, use religious terms to explain his decision, while remaining a pacifist, to join the Home Guard: ‘In fighting Hitler we are truly fighting the Devil, the Anti-Christ … Hitler was a crusader against God’
His best-known comment on the subject was remembered on his death:
The Old Testament is responsible for more atheism, agnosticism, disbelief — call it what you will — than any book ever written; it has emptied more churches than all the counter-attractions of cinema, motor bicycle and golf course.
He also wrote in the poem ‘Explained’:
Elizabeth Ann
Said to her Nan:
Please will you tell me how God began?
Somebody must have made Him.
So who could it be, ‘cos I want to know?
So, it seems that Milne was probably agnostic and veering on a non-believer but one who following a pretty religious upbringing in the late nineteenth century found it hard to completely let go as it was in those days and explaining that out loud, even harder.
It’s still difficult for me to tell my mother that I am an atheist and have been for many years following a similar childhood, where she is quite in disbelief and overtly saddened by my views.
Anyway, this blog is about the rebirth that nature brings us each year and one that is quite independent of any otherworldly beliefs and one that the ‘Scottish Enlightenment’ here began to address in the mid-eighteenth century questioning religion and allowing freedom of debate on subjects such as art, politics, science, medicine, engineering and especially philosophy that was, in those days difficult to contemplate in public.
That blog is here if you want to read it: Money can’t buy love, as the Beatles once suggested but it can buy a better death. However, contemplating ‘assisted-dying’ might well become part of a new ‘Scottish Enlightenment’ very soon!
https://medium.com/@DuncanHynd/money-cant-buy-love-as-the-beatles-once-suggested-but-it-can-buy-a-better-death-202150c6d2db
So yes, I definitely do firmly believe in yellow these days!
However, with a nod to the divine, it seems that Hindus see yellow as the colour of knowledge and learning. Lord Vishnu’s dress is yellow symbolizing his representation of knowledge.
Lord Krishna and Ganesha also wear yellow dresses while both Christians and Hindus associate yellow, seen as the colour of fire with renewal and purity and so while not the same, seemingly not a million miles away from my amateur philosophy above!
Winnie-the-Pooh
Milne’s bear was so much more than the famous animated hero of our childhoods and one that many Disney cartoons later featured. He and his friends were very much into philosophy with Milne using the characters to express many of his own beliefs. You probably wouldn’t have thought about using Pooh bear to find quotes about death, dying or saying goodbye to someone you love and so I have selected a few here that are in line with this article, secular in nature.
Death:
‘If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day, so I never have to live without you.’
‘If ever there is tomorrow when we’re not together, there is something you must always remember. You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think. But the most important thing is, even if we’re apart… I’ll always be with you.’
‘Wherever they go, and whatever happens to them on the way, in that enchanted place on the top of the forest, a little boy and his bear will always be playing.’
‘I used to believe in forever, but forever’s too good to be true.’
Life:
‘Some people care too much. I think it’s called love.’
‘How do you spell love?’ said Piglet, ‘You don’t spell it, you feel it, said Pooh
‘Rivers know this, there is no hurry. We shall get there some day.’
‘Sometimes,’ said Pooh, ‘the smallest things take up the most room in your heart’
Goodbye:
‘How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.’
‘But, of course, it isn’t really good-bye, because the forest will always be there… and anybody who is friendly with bears can find it.’
Airbnb offers a new feature when booking holidays, one where a death has occurred of a famous person at some time in the past!
In his writing prime, A.A. Milne lived at Cotchford Farm in Hartfield, East Sussex, the house, gardens and surrounding woods and country side inspired his children’s books. However, it is now available as a holiday let on Airbnb, but that is not the whole story!
The large country house has gained notoriety as it was also the home of Rolling Stones original member Brian Jones, who was found dead in the outdoor swimming pool in 1969, his death officially recorded as ‘misadventure’.
Around the grounds it is said that there are statues of the main characters in Milne’s books and poems, including Christopher Robin, Owl and an old sundial with images of Piglet, Tigger and Roo that also features words such as, ‘This warm, sunny spot belongs to Pooh, and here he wonders what it’s time to do’.
The Airbnb listing stated that you can ‘stay in the former home of A.A. Milne, Christopher Robin and Winnie The Pooh’ while mentioning that the property was a welcoming family home and historic building while Brian Jones was among other owners since the Milne family had it.
Some pictures located in the house have seemingly documented the chaos associated with the finding of Jones’s body in the pool and others showed Jones standing with the statues. It also seems that Christopher Robin, was not a great fan of being included in his father’s books and they sadly went their separate ways before Milne died there in 1956. An ill-fated property perhaps?
The Marie Curie charity began by delivering radiotherapy to women in 1930, who knew! They use the daffodil as the icon for their amazing end of lifecare charity for a reason.
This charity is the leading one in the UK that deals with dying, death and goodbye but it had roots in a subject close to my heart.
The Marie Curie charity really started life at the Marie Curie Hospital in Hampstead, London in 1930 where the ‘radiological treatment of women suffering from cancer and allied diseases’ was undertaken in what was a very early, specialist radiotherapy centre. Staffed only by women it had facilities for both radium and x-ray therapy with in and out-patient facilities. Amazingly in 1944, most of the hospital was razed to the ground in the blitz whereby their radium radioactive sources, safely stored in steel containers took, it seems three weeks to find in the rubble, probably much to the relief of the local RPA, if indeed they had one in those days!
In 1948 the rebuilt hospital parted ways from the newly born NHS, which Bevan had famously described as a ‘great and novel undertaking’ so that the name of Marie Curie could be established in the charitable medical field. Known initially as the ‘Marie Curie International Memorial Foundation’ it primarily investigated the needs of cancer patients and the best ways of helping them.
The first Marie Curie Home for cancer patients was opened in 1952, based in an old National Trust property in Fife while during the 1950s and early 1960s, the charity opened a further nine Marie Curie Homes in specially adapted but old buildings all over the UK while the charity’s main remit was to help cancer patients who needed nursing directly at home. Another aim was to make a substantial contribution to cancer research, especially into its causes and treatments.
From the 1960s onwards all Marie Curie Homes would be specially designed and newly built. The first was opened in Belfast in 1965. A similar, larger building followed in Edinburgh in 1966.
Their 24/7, day and night nursing service for cancer patients continued to grow throughout the 1960s while further specialist, dedicated laboratories opened for cancer research work.
From the early 1980s, ‘Marie Curie Homes’ and later the newly named ‘Marie Curie Hospices’ moved away from providing long-term nursing care to cancer patients, and became increasingly focused on hospice care, a field that they are now renowned for world-wide with the ability to offer palliative care for more patients, who were more seriously ill and usually for shorter periods of time.
The link to daffodils began in Scotland in 1986 in what was termed their first ‘daffodil appeal’ using live daffodils as a hand out similar to the poppy appeal. This continued to grow throughout the 1990s when they incorporated the daffodil into their logo, where it remains today.
They developed innovative fundraising partnerships with major companies and opened their first high street charity shops while in 1995, the Marie Curie Memorial Foundation became Marie Curie Cancer Care.
They launched their first national campaign called ‘supporting the choice to die at home’ and diversified to allow for the treatment of all terminal illnesses and not a charity just aimed at cancer patients. They successfully helped more terminally ill people remain in their homes, reducing the need for emergency hospital treatment, allowing more people to die at home and saving the NHS money.
Research efforts were focused on finding better ways of caring for terminally ill people and their families through palliative care research programs while establishing a major grants programme, awarding around £1 million every year to fund palliative care research projects, on a competitive basis becoming one of the UK’s leading funders of palliative care research.
In October 2014, the name was reduced to simply ‘Marie Curie’, to reflect the work to support people affected by all terminal illnesses.
Their main focus today is to assist people to make the right plans and preparations and to find the information and support they need when confronted with dying themselves or for family and friends facing bereavement. This includes prioritising social inclusion as some communities they have discovered get disproportionately less support than others at the end of life.
The Marie Curie Policy
‘We’re determined to fight for a world where everyone gets the best experience they possibly can at the end of their lives’.
Their ‘Better end of life’ report is here if you want to find out more on this amazing charity:
https://www.mariecurie.org.uk/policy/better-end-of-life-2022
And then the swallows return, the bluebells come out and we move on again!
PS. I wanted to add a section on music, an important part of my own life and am aware of the use of yellow in a few well-known hits, The Beatles and Coldplay come to mind. However, just as I write this latest piece, UK rapper ‘Big Zuu’ who also doubles as a brilliant ‘pop-up’ celebrity chef on TV has released his new song, its’ simply called Yellow! It’s great, shows off his musical talent in a different light and so I simply had to include it!

Hello from the world I’m embroiled in, where I’m way deeper than knee-deep in developing a new long-term unrestricted £15m pooled fund that shifts power to local people to make decisions on a cohort of community orgs in Edinburgh to lead place-based systems change across some big themes - poverty, racial inequality and injustice and climate change (phew — and yes I do have a bad habit of long sentences!).
Last week I wrote an update and thanks to our amazing learning groups as we come to the end of this chapter of co-design. I also have shared this with a group of people who have been advising, following along, supporting and cheering on.
Reminder that our learning groups have been a mix of individuals via End Poverty Edinburgh, community organisations, and funders and public sector partners — if you’d like to read more here is a blog that talks about this.
After I sent that I thought… I have an almost ready-made blog here.
So here is the (slightly edited) April 2024 update on Regenerative Futures Fund:
From March 2024 we have moved into a new phase of the project which means bringing the learning groups as they have been since the late 2022 / early 2023, to a close.
In March 2024 we created a condensed version of the detailed operational plan, which can be accessed here on the EVOC website.
We are also hoping to do an open Q&A session for community organisations in Edinburgh soon.
A few updates (and thanks!):
As ever, keen to chat with anyone who would like to meet to talk any aspect through, you’d like to get involved. Amazingly, there is SO much more to share than what’s in this update (I’ve missed so many things, it probably needs another blog!) — but I’m always to happy to chat over anything here and missing bits.
An information / conversation session coming soon — for Edinburgh community orgs.
And our ‘funders progressing proposals’ group has been meeting regularly since January if anyone from funding orgs would like to know more about that in terms of joining as a funding partner by contributing to the pooled fund.
Phew!
Finally — In 2023 I set myself a challenge to do 42 swims in my 42nd year and happy to report I am on track although I will be in the sea 4 times between now and next Saturday! Happy to have achieved a wee personal goal alongside a busy work year, and look forward to more swims in my 43rd year and beyond. Here is a pic of my favourite local swimming spot in early April ❤️
Please do email me on leah.black@evoc.org.uk or find me on LinkedIn (that’s where things seem to be happening now) if you’d like to chat 😁

3/4/2024
As decentralization becomes a central theme within the blockchain community, there’s an increasing recognition of the need to systematically evaluate the levels of decentralization within blockchain networks. In response to this need, the University of Edinburgh has spearheaded the creation of the Edinburgh Decentralization Index (EDI). This initiative aims to provide a detailed and open-source framework for evaluating blockchain networks, highlighting the industry’s shift towards distributed ecosystems and emphasizing the critical need for transparency and standardization in blockchain assessments.
On March 1st, 2024, the unveiling of the EDI Dashboard’s alpha version represented a significant step forward in blockchain transparency. Spearheaded by the University of Edinburgh and funded by a grant from Input Output Global (IOG), this open-source index was a result of a collaborative effort with multiple universities. By pooling their diverse academic insights and technical expertise, the partnership aimed to ensure the tool’s relevance and adaptability across different blockchain contexts.
The Decentralization Index is crafted to be objective and unbiased, with the aim of developing into an industry-wide accepted benchmark for assessing decentralization as it progresses over time.
The Edinburgh Decentralization Index (EDI) employs a variety of metrics to evaluate the decentralization levels of Layer 1 blockchains, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, Ethereum, Litecoin, Tezos, and Zcash. Understanding these metrics can help stakeholders assess the robustness and fairness of different blockchain networks.
Nakamoto Coefficient: This metric indicates the minimum number of entities required to control over 50% of mining or staking power, thus highlighting potential vulnerabilities in the network’s decentralization. A higher Nakamoto Coefficient suggests a more resilient and distributed network, making it a crucial measure for assessing security against collusion or attacks.
Gini Coefficient: By measuring the inequality within the distribution of block production, the Gini coefficient helps identify the balance of power within the network. A lower Gini coefficient indicates a more equitable distribution, which is essential for ensuring that no single entity has disproportionate control or influence over the network.
Shannon Entropy: This measure of information entropy quantifies the unpredictability and diversity of block producers. Higher Shannon entropy suggests a more decentralized network, reflecting a varied and unpredictable block production that enhances network security and fairness.
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI): The HHI measures market concentration to evaluate the diversity of block producers. Low HHI values denote a decentralized network with a balanced distribution of power among participants, which is vital for preventing dominance by any single entity.
Theil Index: This index measures the redundancy in a population, with lower values indicating a more equal distribution of block production. By assessing the diversity of participation in the network, the Theil index provides insights into the network’s decentralization and operational fairness.
Max Power Ratio: Representing the proportion of blocks produced by the most dominant entity, this metric sheds light on the extent of control exerted by the largest block producer. A lower max power ratio is preferable for a healthy, decentralized ecosystem, ensuring no single participant overly influences the network.
Tau-Decentralization Index: This index measures the concentration of power by identifying the minimum number of entities controlling more than a specific fraction (e.g., 66%) of mining or staking power. It offers a nuanced view of network control, essential for understanding deeper layers of decentralization beyond the majority control.
These metrics collectively offer a multi-dimensional view of blockchain decentralization, providing valuable insights for users, developers, and regulators to understand and improve the distributed ecosystems of various blockchains.
The Edinburgh Decentralization Index (EDI) aims to reshape the blockchain landscape by providing a standardized approach to evaluating decentralization. This could significantly impact the future of blockchain technology, potentially paving the way for widespread adoption. As businesses, institutions, and nation-states begin utilizing blockchains for various purposes like identity management, payment systems, and governance, it could lead to increased adoption of blockchain technologies across both public and private sectors. This, in turn, would drive innovation and enhance efficiency.
By offering clear metrics for decentralization, the EDI facilitates more informed decisions by governments and organizations. For instance, a country might choose to adopt a blockchain like Cardano for its stablecoin initiative. Such applications could enhance public trust in blockchain and stimulate broader usage across various sectors.
Furthermore, with the EDI placing decentralization at the forefront, current and future blockchain systems are likely to be encouraged to become more decentralized and incorporate features such as on-chain governance. This emphasis on decentralization could lead to increased adoption of blockchain technologies for both public and private applications, thereby driving innovation and efficiency.
As the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry focuses more on decentralization in the future, the development of the Edinburgh Decentralization Index (EDI) by the University of Edinburgh will play a crucial role and lay the foundation for future metrics by which blockchains are measured. Moving forward, with the EDI emphasizing decentralization, it will be poised to encourage the adoption of more decentralized approaches within blockchain systems, fostering innovation and efficiency across both public and private applications.

A week’s adventure loop from Edinburgh
Venturing out on a cycle tour in August 2020 as Scotland gradually emerges from the coronavirus lockdown was a complicated decision, fraught with factors we’d never had to consider on bicycle trips before. First the question of whether we should even leave home for a week, and add our needs for accommodation, food, and facilities to the burden placed on other towns. Then, whether we could manage proper handwashing and social distancing from the saddle. And not least, if we were to encounter any injuries or difficulties along the way, could we manage that ourselves without putting others at risk?
The choice to travel during a pandemic is an individual one, based on personal circumstances, capacities, and acceptance of risk. We were certain we didn’t want to board a train or a plane unnecessarily, but a self-supported bicycle camping trip seemed a reasonable form of recreation, and although we planned to be away for a week we were never more than 60 miles away from home in case we needed to return quickly. We packed our face coverings, hand sanitiser, puncture repair tools, and first-aid kit; counted ourselves extremely fortunate to be in good health with time off from work; and hit the road.
Day 1 encompassed 40 miles from Edinburgh down to Innerleithen, following the brilliant National Cycle Network Route 1 along traffic-free paths and quiet roads out of the city, over the Moorfoot Hills and down into a beautiful valley beside the Leithen Water. It was a hot, pre-thunderstorm day and our legs were decidedly unused to hills after being inside for months, but it was still a joyful experience to finally be released from the cramped confines of the city and be flying along on two wheels.
In Innerleithen we visited with friends, and the next morning had a lovely breakfast outdoors at the Café Sitooterie.
Notes on the route: brilliant off-road cycle paths (converted from former railway lines so mostly flat) all the way from Edinburgh to Bonnyrigg. From Bonnyrigg the route is on-road on minor B roads with little traffic. No villages or services for 20 miles until Innerleithen; we picked up sandwiches and snacks at the Bonnyrigg Co-op.
Day 2 took us from Innerleithen down to the Ruberslaw Wild Woods Camping site a few miles from Denholm. We followed NCN Route 1 along a gorgeous riverside path and through quiet woods, rolling up and down hills to Melrose. Melrose is a lovely town with an historic Abbey (one of the stops on the Four Abbeys local cycle loop) but it was closed under coronavirus restrictions. The town itself was quite busy so we stopped at another Co-op to buy some bagels and peanut butter (by now our classic bike touring lunch menu) along with groceries for a camp dinner, and had a picnic in Gibson Park.
Notes on the route: between Caddonfoot and Tweedbank the NCN slips off the road and down a tiny dirt path next to the river, well-hidden by trees and bushes. We missed the sign and instead turned right across a newly-surfaced cycling and pedestrian bridge — which was fabulous infrastructure, even if it was the wrong direction (for us). Although NCN 1 follows the river most of the way to Newtown St Boswells, it’s not flat; we tackled about 1,000 feet of elevation gain including a good climb out of Melrose.
From Melrose we cycled on to Newtown St Boswells, where we had to leave the NCN and scout our own route south to Denholm. Navigation was a bit tricky since many of the minor roads were unsigned, but we wound our way through the countryside and arrived at the campsite around 6:30pm. We’d been lucky to get a booking in advance, since so many campsites are fully booked for weeks due to high demand. Ruberslaw is a well-run and pretty fancy campsite, with a central Hub with showers, phone charging and Wifi, and a shared open-air kitchen with a microwave and electric tea kettle! We’d opted to camp in one of their forest pitches, so after checking in we had to hike-a-bike up a grassy farm track to our spot in the woods.
Day 3 was a “rest” day. We were staying a second night at Ruberslaw but had to change sites since we hadn’t been able to book two nights in one spot. So we packed up camp and carried our gear with us 8 miles to Hawick (pronounced “Hoyk”) which was the closest town with a grocery store. As always seems to be the case, avoiding the main roads usually at least doubles the climbing, so it turned out to be a fairly strenuous “rest day” ride. In Hawick we had lunch outside at the Damascus Drum cafe and picked up some food to cook in camp before cycling 8 miles back (this time on a flatter route).
Day 4 brought 1,200 feet of elevation gain on foot, and another 1,600 feet on bikes. We spent the morning climbing Ruberslaw itself (“law” being a common word in Scotland for a hill, from the Anglo-Saxon word hlāw). The thunderstorms had finally broken overnight, so we left our wet tent to dry out a bit and hiked through the mist and purple heather up to the summit.
We left camp around 12pm and cycled on minor roads through Jedburgh up to Kelso. The rain caught up with us as we arrived in Kelso, notable for having a cobbled square with all cobbled roads leading into it —this is quite the experience on bikes (I call it the Cobble Wobble). All the cafes were closed and we were contemplating soggy takeaway sandwiches from Greggs until we happened to spot a nearby pub with a covered outdoor picnic table and made a dash for that just as the clouds burst open again. We tucked ourselves and our bikes under the awning and had an excellent lunch. (The name of the pub was, of course, The Cobbles — highly recommended).
We waited out the rain as long as we could then left Kelso looking for NCN Route 1 again (we missed the turn, but our alternate route on the back roads through Stichill and Leitholm was virtually traffic-free and mostly flat). The rain came down hard again for about 5 minutes, which was plenty of time to get us thoroughly drenched, even in our waterproof gear. Luckily we had 14 miles to dry out before we reached Swinton. We stayed overnight with some kind and covid-conscious Airbnb hosts who let us dry out our tent in their airing cupboard.
Notes on the route: after Jedburgh we turned north on the B6400 towards the tiny hamlet of Nisbet and then followed the Borders Abbeys Way for awhile. The section of the Borders Abbeys Way east from Nisbet is a rocky gravel track; for a paved road option go a bit further along the B6400 and take the next right.
Day 5, heading for the seaside! It was a short 17-mile ride from Swinton to Berwick-upon-Tweed in sunny weather. We cycled over the River Tweed and crossed the border from Scotland into England, then rejoined NCN 1 in Norham. We took a brief break in the shade and had a look round the Norham Castle ruins, then carried on, crossing over the 200-year-old Union Chain suspension bridge and following a separated cycle track briefly alongside the A1, then a bridleway over the hill into Berwick.
We set up camp at the Seaview Caravan Park on the outskirts of Berwick, and spent the rest of the sunny afternoon on the beach. (The Caravan Park was ok, not much accommodation for tents other than a small patch of lawn alongside the road, but lovely views and good facilities for toilets, showers, and washing-up sinks.)
Day 6, so long, sunshine. A thick fog rolled in overnight and beclouded the whole coast. We had a second night booked at the Caravan Park and had planned a day ride out and back to Lindisfarne National Nature Reserve and Holy Island, about 15 miles down the coast. Holy Island is connected to the mainland by a tidal causeway which is flooded by the sea twice a day, but the safe crossing window that day was between 12:10pm — 9:20pm so we had plenty of time. We followed NCN 1 all the way, which is a fantastic adventure over grassy clifftop paths (unpaved for most of the route). We were quite glad not to be hauling heavy panniers but met a few loaded touring cyclists who seemed to be having a great time. We intended to stop at the lone Londis shop near Beal for provisions, but instead came across the Barn at Beal Restaurant & Campsite so had coffee and very good sandwiches there instead.
Day 7 turned out to be our longest distance day, cycling 50 miles from Berwick-upon-Tweed to Yellowcraig Beach. We had takeaway breakfast rolls and coffee from the Mule on Rouge Cafe in Berwick, picked up some bread and cheese for lunch on the road, and cycled out on NCN 1, connecting to NCN 76 as we left town. NCN 76 was our route for most of the day; we left it briefly at Foulden to head inland and skipped the scenic loop to Eyemouth (saving those miles and hills for another day). We had lunch on the side of the road, picked wild blackberries, and rolled through the lovely town of Dunbar and then into North Berwick (not to be confused with Berwick-upon-Tweed).
Notes on the route: NCN 76 is mostly on-road, using quiet minor roads but with a 5-mile stretch on the A1107 from near Reston to Cocksburnpath. It’s a fast road but there weren’t many cars and drivers gave us plenty of space. After Bilsdean there’s a separated cycle way next to the A1 (crossing the A1 is required at one point, at a guided crossing) which takes you past Torness Nuclear Power Station. Not long after it’s a traffic-free path into Dunbar, and then it’s mostly on the John Muir Way (a mix of quiet roads, traffic-free paths, and grassy tracks) into North Berwick and on to Yellowcraig Beach.
After a short break in North Berwick we pedalled another 3 miles on to Yellowcraig Beach to wild camp for the night. There was a handful of other tents spaced out across the dunes when we arrived, and signs permitting responsible camping, so we waved hello to our distant camping neighbours, pitched our tent, and made macaroni cheese on the beach.
Day 8 was a straightforward journey from Yellowcraig Beach back home to Edinburgh, following a familiar route on the NCN 76. Glad to be back safely, and grateful for the dedicated folk at Sustrans who have built the fantastic National Cycle Network for everyone to travel along.
Total distance and elevation gain: 232 miles, 9,875 feet

During 2022 summer, I participated in a summer programme — student-led, individually-created course — in the University of Edinburgh. What this course about is students themselves design the course that they plan to study and use reflective framework to develop personal and professional skills throughout their learning process.
It is a good way to learn knowledge or skills outside of one’s major and with the guidance from the university, students are able to individually conduct reflective report regarding their study path — a meaningful assessment method on what students have learnt.
When I think about what I want to learn during the summer, a question popped out: what else can I create with the background of studying psychology?
It turns out that User Experience (UX) Design is an area connect tightly to psychology as it involves knowing users and solving their problems. Therefore, I decided to learn in more details how a UX designer conduct a project and what skills are required along the way.
The project that I choose to carry on is to solve a problem that I accidentally saw in the newspaper in which it talks about Nigeria’s stock market may need more than technology to thrive. Therefore, with the hope to have an accessible app for people with little investment knowledge to use, I decided to design an iOS app that can make users find it more easily to invest stocks online.
Project Showcase:
To have the prototypes like the picture showed above, I need to acquire several skills:
This programme requires two reflective reports to be submitted as a way of assessing students’ ability to self-trace what has been doing well and what can be improved.
To achieve a distinct grade, reports should show the writers’ reflection framework when reviewing their study processes. In particular, students’ critical reflection is important as it can shows that they are not only paying attention to what goes well but also taking into account areas that can be improved. For example, though I noticed that my learning process of using Figma is efficient in terms of time-management, the way I learn only relies on having my project done. If there is more self-exploration when learning to use Figma, my learning pathway can be more diverse.
Although in most of the time, this programme test people’s ability to self-study, each student is assigned to a tutor who will provide advice with how to improve their reflective ability.
Finally, I got an A with all the assessment being reviewed by my tutors. What this programme is about is not only the mark that I got, but truly teaches me the importance of learning process rather than the outcome.
Before enrolled in this programme, I rarely thought about what I want to do as my career. Although I am glad to being able to learn Psychology, there are so much choices that I can make to further my career.
With this programme experience, I decided to learn the UX design further and hope to being able to produce more projects that are useful for the real-world. Although I am lack of certain design skills, I believe this story told me that when one person decided to be the teacher and teach himself/herself, the power of learning is unbelievable.

on Edinburgh’s Royal Mile
St Giles High Kirkis celebrating its 900th birthday in style by getting some marvellous new lights installed. This really does cement its place on the Edinburgh skyline as the finest spire or sticky up bit (SOSUB) and I’d be prepared to roll up my sleeves and go bareknuckle with anyone who disagrees.
This long view shows the SOSUBS of (left to right) Edinburgh Castle, The Hub spire, then (in the background) the Scottish National War Memorial at the castle, St Giles crown spire, and The Tron Kirk spire.
You’re basically looking at a compressed Royal Mile squished into one frame with a 500mm lens.
The view from the street is pretty impressive too, especially when the haar rolls in from the North Sea and the beams of light continue into the sky. If only St Giles could work out a way to get £1 from everyone who takes a photo of the spire from the Royal Mile they could pay the leccy bill and a whole lot more.

I am, at heart, a homebody and perhaps that is why part of me is forever shocked I don’t live in my birth city. It’s especially dumbfounding given just how sensational Edinburgh, Scotland is as an abode: knock it out the park architecture everywhere the eye can see; it’s a manageable size (everything is basically ten minutes away from everything else); it is a place of international significance, historically (the birthplace of the Age of Enlightenment) and now (the city’s population doubles in size every August for its miscellany of festivals (International, Fringe, Book, Jazz)).
I left Edinburgh for the first time in 2000, aged seventeen to go to university (destination: Oxford) and returned in 2003, only to leave it again in 2012, aged twenty-eight (destination: London) hoping to leave behind my broken-heart and to kickstart my life as a blindsided singleton.
Plenty of people leave cities in those sorts of circumstances, but in the case of the 2012 departure, I do rather regret doing so, for it gave rise to a prolonged, complex grief from which I sometimes doubt I have yet fully recovered.
At the time, it felt like the whole city had been contaminated by a betrayal I had experienced at the hands of a boy I thought…

Edinburgh Festivals 2015 Impact Study
Quality of events and record numbers drive the world’s Festival City
Earlier this week, Festivals Edinburgh and BOP released the findings for the 2015 Festivals Edinburgh Impact Report. With the help of more than 30,000 survey respondents, our report quantifies the economic, social and cultural impact of the twelve Edinburgh Festivals represented by Festivals Edinburgh. The report confirms the significant contribution that Edinburgh Festivals make to the quality of life, international reputation and economic strength of Edinburgh and Scotland.
Key findings from our study show that:
The study takes a holistic approach to assessing impact that considers social, cultural and economic effects. This approach of assessing the ‘all-round’ value of the Festivals was ground breaking when BOP pioneered it for the 2010 Festivals Impact Study, and was the first study of its kind — not just for the twelve Edinburgh Festivals, but more widely in the Festivals and events sector.
This current study follows on from the methodology developed in 2010 and provides the first directly comparable data on the impacts of the Festivals at a five-year follow-up stage.
Read the full report, as well as the earlier 2010 report here.

I didn’t think that mice were good at climbing… until I rented a flat in Edinburgh!
If you’ve ever visited Edinburgh you’ll have noticed that much of the city is comprised of stone tenement flats. These ‘apartment blocks’ are usually 3 or 4 storeys high, often with a row of shops on the ground floor. Many date back to the 19th century, and most of them have rows and rows of chimneys on their terraced rooftops.
I’ve lived in several of these tenement flats, and visited many more. They are popular with students and young couples alike.
Being built of solid stone, with wood and plaster walls, there are gaps a-plenty. There are cracks around the skirting boards, in the backs of cupboards, around the old boarded up fireplaces (Edinburgh’s nickname of Auld Reekie comes from the smog emanating from the densely packed flats with a coal fire in each room!).
The tenements have been loved and lived-in by generations of Edinburghers. They provide a great place to live for people who enjoy the buzz of a capital city. They also provide the ideal place to live and bring up your family if you are a mouse!
3 of my flats were on the top floor. These were all on the third floor (fourth if you include ground floor). My flat in Marchmont had incredibly high ceilings, so I was a long way up! You can imagine my surprise when I first heard scratching noises behind a wall. I initially put it down to the students who lived next door.
The next sign that we had furry friends was when I repeatedly found myself cleaning up my flat-mate’s cornflakes on the kitchen worktop. How could he leave such a mess every day?! After a week of daily cleaning I picked up the cereal packet to wipe underneath, and a cascade of cornflakes tumbled from the box.
A mouse had eaten its way through the cardboard.
Soon after the kitchen incident I arrived home one afternoon to find myself face to face with a very well-fed brown and grey mouse, standing quite unperturbed in the middle of the living room floor!
Our eyes met, and for several seconds he sat up and stared right back at me. Without any fear, he then continued munching away on the biscuit crumbs he had found under the table, or down the side of the sofa.
I ran at him, not quite knowing what I would do if I caught him. The mouse nonchalantly ducked back through the tiny crack in the wall, just under the window, and was gone.
It was then that I decided the only way to deal with this was call out the pest control people. A friend had recommended a local mouse control company in Edinburgh so I gave them a call and they arrived the next day.
It was only then that I realised that Edinburgh tenements had the perfect network of tunnels, nooks and crannies which were ideal for mice to travel freely between floors, and build nests in the warm cavities behind those old walls.
The main thing I learned was to NOT LEAVE FOOD LYING OUT. I became an ardent fan of tupperware containers. In the end I didn’t have to kill any mice. I cleared up any traces of food, and blocked off the hole they were using to enter my flat. I presume the mice now visit the other kitchens in that block of flats — the ones that still have cornflakes lying out on the worktop.

I had wanted to post our travel journey chronologically but that just hasn’t happened, we’ve been too busy in some places and I’ve been just plain lazy in others. Perhaps I will write more about the other places our travels have taken us — Miami/New York (USA), Dominica (Caribbean), Havana (Cuba), Lisbon/Vilamoura/Carvoeira/Sintra (Portugal), Marbella/Malaga/Ronda (Spain), and Athens/Sifnos (Greece) and Dublin/Greystones (Ireland) — later. Chandler has been counting how many accomodations [AirBnB, hotels, TrustedHousesitters pet sits] we have stayed at since leaving Los Angeles 13 weeks and 5 days ago, and we are officially at # 26.
He started counting after seeing a couple of retired YouTube travel vloggers declare that they had stayed at 11 places in two months and they called their pace “insane”… he did the math and realized we “won”, yah and sigh.
We are now in Scotland. We started by exploring Edinburgh, which I loved, and then we went to the Scottish Highlands which I love even harder.
Edinburgh was stunning, it looks like every indie movie you have ever seen set in Scotland, cobblestone roads, castles built hundreds of years ago perched on rock formations formed thousands of years ago. But we kept reading things about “Edinburgh’s dark past” [truthfully they seem a little proud of it] so finally I googled it. Here are some of the juicy-awful results:
Edinburgh had some of the largest witch hunts in Europe with hideously sadistic torture methods, burning alive at the stake was one of the kinder methods and of course the bubonic plague in the 16th and 17th century.
“In 1456, a defensive wall was built around the Old Town. Problem was, no one wanted to live outside it, so as the population grew, people were packed together in increasingly unsanitary, greasy, moldy conditions. The only way to expand was upwards, so buildings got taller until they were up to 14 stories high, but had no toilets or running water. Residents would throw their waste out of their windows, shouting “gardyloo” as an advance warning, but it didn’t always work, and passers-by would get covered in poo.” [Source: Buzzfeed]
“Pestilence spread particularly rapidly in the tenement-filled, poverty-stricken, unhygenic conditions of the Royal Mile, and the council reacted with particularly brutal measures. When an outbreak hit the crowded Mary King’s Close, they ordered it to be bricked up, trapping over 300 infected and non-infected residents in their homes.” [Source: Buzzfeed]
But by the time we reached Edinburgh on June 4th, 2024 it was pretty damn civilized. We went to a little vegan options restaurant, had a couple of craft cocktails, and retired back to our AirBnB, certainly one of the prettiest I have been in, located in a historic building a block from the train station.
And as Taylor Swift was performing that weekend at Murrayfied Stadium, a herd [a gaggle, a flock, a swarm…a murder?] of Swifties descended upon Edinburgh. But as much as I hate crowds, they were so pink and sparkly and happy that it was hard to be annoyed at them. I almost joined them as ticket prices were “a bargain” compared to the U.S.A.; great seats could be had in Edinburgh for less than $500 as opposed to $2000 in L.A. and New York. But we didn’t, I fought my FOMO and won.
I thought I loved Scotland after seeing Edinburgh but man, it wasn’t until we got to the Highlands that I decided I really love it here. Despite the fact that it looks like every fantasy tale you’ve ever read as a child, with a demon possibly poised behind every moss-covered tree in the forest, that what is that sound-did I lock the door feeling I always had in the middle of the night in Los Angeles was gone. I felt safe. At last.
I really didn’t realize how the constant stress levels affected me both as a police officer in South Los Angeles and as a woman feeling vulnerable in her own home, but there was a palpable release when that feeling left me. It’s like a big warm hug and someone squeezing poison out of your system.
Crime is very low, air is clean, no natural disasters, and there are hardly any even predators, dogs are pretty much all floofs [and anyone who knows me knows I have loved and rescued bully breeds forever, but still, it is nice to walk a block without some ferocious sounding pack of dogs barking at you like my old neighborhood in Los Angeles], you are more likely to get hurt by a cow or a deer than anything else here. A cow or a deer.
How often could I take a walk in Los Angeles and not run into a single person, only hear the wind and the birds? In my entire life I can’t think of many places I can say that about. The beauty in Scotland is gob smacking, photos do not do it justice, epic mountains, rivers, forests and streams, Scotland has sights that are similarly as wondrous as Iceland without the swaths of humanity we encountered there.
Chela Landau’s youtube.com of a
Chandler saying goodbye to our Air BnB dog — Chela Landau’s youtube.com of
AirBnBs in Scotland bear no resemblance to any other place I’ve been. They ask you about your preferences, they stock the kitchen with vegan food, they meet you at the door and they often hug you when you leave.
At our AirBnB in Redcastle, Scotland the hostess showed us a “bothy” which we had access to during our stay with them, in U.S. terms it is like a man-cave shed, this one was small and cozy, had a wood burning stove and many candles. It was fabulous the one night we used it to read Harry Potter by candle light, intimate and romantic and exciting. Quite frankly though, the decapitated deer head staring at me with dead black eyes over the stove made me balk at going again back the next night as Chandler wanted.
But we were so content at our Redcastle AirBnB with it’s gorgeous garden and firth view, that we rarely ventured out except to get groceries at a market near us, which had a beautiful assortment of freshly grown fruit and vegetables.
After we got staples to eat the booze hunt was on, we found the local supermarket pretty well stocked [funny to see Jack Daniels in the foreign liquor section]. Looking for a local whisky for Chandler, I was corrected when I called it “Scotch”, they said that I should call it simply “Whisky” or risk insulting a Scotsman. (Yes, Scots remove the “e” in whiskey).
I have to say I’m a bourbon lass, I just can’t quite get behind that taste of moss in my drink, I will do better but for now it is tiny careful sips. I do love the stories however, I like the stories better than the actual whisky.
Any real whiskey drinker will know about “The Angel’s Share”; in medieval times when they would come to check on the barrels of whisky and they would have lost a third of the barrel’s contents to condensation, they believed that it was lost to the angels who had come down from heaven to sample their stock, and they figured in the loss as an offering that would make the angels smile upon them.
One of my favorite bourbon whiskeys is an American bourbon named Angels Envy in a sly wink to the folklore [athough in a bar we saw the sign “We have Whisky and Bourbon”, as though bourbon was a child of a lesser god and not worthy to be called whisky.
Anyhow, enough for today, we are going to Isle of Skye next and then Inverness to take a plane to Amsterdam, where we plan on settling in the Netherlands to begin our new lives; actually our new lives have begun, and every day is cherished.

I headed out at 10 but not before requesting a bottom bunk for tonight. Last night was hell! It goes without saying that I had to use the loo at least half a dozen times last night. Sometimes I don’t need to go at all or more usually, just once! I’m strong but not invincible. I was singing this song as I descended the spiral staircase. I was going to have a good day if it killed me.
My plan B was to buy some disposable adult nappies. Don’t laugh. They are the best invention since Scottish toasties which is what I’m having for breakfast right now. Filled with haggis, caramelised onion chutney and matured cheddar cheese. In the spirit of full disclosure, I did go to the Snax Cafe first, hoping for a full Scottish breakfast but I couldn’t get through the door — no I’m not that fat! — it was filled with people all waiting for food. It’s smoko time for the construction workers in the area. So I’m in the Snax Bakehouse next door where I’m enjoying a window seat and my coffee and Scottish toastie.

There are two things that strike me every time I walk the streets of Edinburgh.
The first is that nearly everyone is carrying tote bags full of groceries. So many flats in the city don’t have storage space, so grocery shopping is a daily errand.
The second is the incredibly disciplined behaviour of the dozens of dogs being walked by their owners that pass by me every day.
Their behaviour is invariably impeccable, regardless of age or breed.
They walk at their master’s side, many on leash, some not, keeping step, and seldom varying their focus from looking straight ahead. They don’t seem to take note of anyone or anything they pass by, including fellow canines. They don’t stop to exchange sniffs or even to sniff any of the myriad enticements at their level. Never has a passing pooch glanced up at me, hoping for a pat. One dog I noticed that did let its attention drift to the undergrowth of a shrub moved hastily along when its owner said: “Come along, love.”

Edinburgh’s music scene has always been, to an extent, fairly eclectic. Trad-folk pubs stand adjacent to metal bars, and indie kids nod their heads to glitzy guitar pop before hard techno nights on the Cowgate every weekend. While this diversity is self-evident, it’s impossible to ignore the fact that within each genre or sub-scene, artists tend to adhere to certain ideas of musical safety or appropriateness at their respective venues. I am by no means questioning the validity or talent of any of these bands — there are a huge host of genuinely fantastic acts who fall into this description that I actively support — but I would like to direct attention towards some of the city’s more obscure and boundary-pushing music which tends to be ignored by the scene as a whole.
By writing this article, I hope to present a primer for anyone interested in discovering more about Edinburgh’s incredible outsider and experimental musicians who are stretching genre limitations and forging their own paths within the city’s scene. This is not necessarily a definitive list; there is likely a myriad of under-the-radar performers who have escaped my attention so far, but I would like to stress that — as far as I’m aware — this group remains on the fringes of the scene. Consider my thoughts, listen to the music, go to see the acts play live — supporting these people will not only benefit the individuals, but will also foster support and encouragement for artistic experimentation in general. Dig in!
Oharasix: https://oharasix.bandcamp.com/
The experimental and the electronic always go hand-in-hand, as both tendencies tend to strive for sonic and technological innovation. Josh Corkill’s output under the ‘Oharasix’ moniker perfectly embodies this approach: digitally manipulated samples and loops combine to create an unsettling landscape of warped club tracks, dominated by rhythmic glitches and pumping techno-inspired kicks. This stuff is an audiophile’s dream, as Corkill’s manic production is jittery, maximalist and wholly unique. The two live releases available on the Oharasix bandcamp page are the best examples of his skill, as both performances are rife with repetitive, glassy synth stabs which fly around and punctuate the underlying beats of every piece. Having witnessed Josh perform at Sketchy Beats last year, I can fully recommend catching him live whenever you get the chance — using just Ableton and a modest MIDI controller, he has a prodigious ability to sculpt industrial noise into a seamless and infectiously dance-able mix.
Smiling Suns:
https://soundcloud.com/smilingsuns
Serving as the aural antidote to the noise of Oharasix, Smiling Suns is an ambient project centred around organic instrumentation and minimal arrangements. The anonymous musician’s SoundCloud page is home to some truly compelling compositions where art music, post-rock and folk collide. Appropriately titled, 2017’s Quiet Songs II is a collection of tranquil musical sketches, constructed sparsely on acoustic piano, accordion, and slide guitar. Smiling Suns’ bio lists both Stars of the Lid and Godspeed You! Black Emperor as influences, and it is easy to observe their mark on the affective melodies of ‘Rhema’ and ‘Baby Steps,’ but an immediate sense of individuality underpins the form of every track. ‘Duror’ features a stunning chorus of reverberating classical guitars which float over a droning accordion, and the lo-fi warmth of ‘Falling’ is mesmerising. This really is one of the hidden gems of the Edinburgh scene (and with such expert concealment of identity, Smiling Suns may well remain hidden) — I’ll be keeping an eager ear to the ground for new material in the future.
Aamber Glass:
https://northtsar.bandcamp.com/album/a-new-year-dithered-dreamer-doused-in-rays-of-sun-cutting-through-the-skyline-of-east-finchley
To continue with the theme of anonymous ambient artists, Aamber Glass is an equally elusive creator of intriguing and understated soundscapes. Only one release has been issued under the mysterious handle — 2018’s evocative ‘a new year’ / ‘dithered dreamer doused in rays of sun cutting through the skyline of east finchley.’ This limited edition cassette consists of two separate “bodies of work.” The first is a series of individual compositions, in which ethereal synth loops are accompanied by echo-drenched field recordings. A personal highlight is the track ‘susanna,’ where a chopped-up, tremolo-laden chord trembles above ghostly background noise and continuously overlapping synth melodies. On the second side of the tape, Aamber Glass builds a mammoth 20-minute wall of modulating drones. We are guided through turns melancholic and tumultuous towards a slowly-fading finale. It is a grandiose, meditative effort which is unabashedly experimental. I genuinely mean it when I say that art of this scope and dedication sets the bar high for any prospective avant-garde composers.
Harry Bongo: https://harrybongo.bandcamp.com/
Perhaps one of the best-known faces on the city’s scene is Mr. Harry Bongo: drummer for numerous noisy instrumental acts, contemporary classical composer and beloved cheese DJ, Bongo is Edinburgh’s diversity personified. Particularly arresting is his solo output, which sees Harry take complete creative control as he crafts an array of beautiful minimalist works. I use the tag ‘minimalist’ tag here with reference to the art music movement rather than production — while such comparisons are reductive, echoes of Reich, Glass and Riley are everywhere on his releases, as repeating mallet sequences evolve into rich climaxes of strings, guitars and percussion. Harry’s self-titled 2016 album displays the breadth of his oeuvre: centrepiece ‘Vessels’ begins with a pulsating groove (which isn’t too far removed from Reich’s Music for 18 Musicians ), and this quickly morphs into an intense, cinematic swirl of computerised arpeggios and throbbing drums. Pieces such as ‘Prague’ and ‘Ashes’ are more restrained, with layers of lush strings and field recordings creating a warm sense of space. After an almost two-year break, Harry released ‘Three in Four’ in late 2018, a hectic single which twists and turns, weaving samples of Björk talking about her TV over frantic drum loops, distorted pianos and wild, echoing synth bleeps. Without giving too much away, I can recommend keeping an eye out for an imminent release — Bongo is back (and in good form, too).
Joe Coghill:
https://soundcloud.com/joecoghill
According to a short biography on the Glasgow International website, Joe Coghill is “a multi-disciplinary artist, musician and experimental publisher,” and so he neatly represents a kind of avant-garde mindset that is crucial to a revitalisation of the scene. “His practice,” it goes on to explain incorporates “video, performance, social sculpture, facilitation and media distribution” (one example of this is his curation of an exhibition at Edinburgh’s Fruitmarket Gallery inspired by no-wave composer John Margotti.) While it’s obvious that Coghill’s work isn’t limited to audio, the small amount of his works available online are incredible displays of experimental electronics. Fans of IDM bastions Aphex Twin and Squarepusher will be particularly at home with the material on his SoundCloud page, which closely resembles one of RDJ’s famed audio dumps: the mammoth collection of twisted samples and glitchy, granular atmospheres features esoteric track titles such as ‘bv,mt Eye’ and ‘Ae_frag.aef2dream’ (a cheeky nod to Autechre, perhaps?) Despite the obvious influences of these pieces, Coghill’s approach is far from derivative. His paranoid sequences and ceaseless folds of noise are refreshingly imaginative, and provide a welcome break from the monotonous tech-house of Edinburgh’s clubs. Dive in!
Mixed Signals: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj_Jrf-g6BPebK7CXKjDLBg
…And now for something completely different. Live double bass and laptop electronics form the crux of Mixed Signals’ sound, providing a base for a tapestry of sinister drones, eerie vocal snippets and chopped-up field recordings. Long-form, slow-burning pieces are the specialty of these local experimenters, who have concocted a special brand of “mesmerising doom.” As the ensemble tend to operate as a live unit, they don’t currently have a lot of material online — however, their Youtube channel is home to two intriguing examples of their work. ‘The Door to Desolation’ is a 16-minute jam recorded live at the Black Medicine Basement, and ‘Taster Sounds’ is “not polished, not prepared, just a bit of an improvised draft of a taster of a teaser.” Although both of these are presented as spontaneous compositions, they are impressive statements of unique musicianship and an unorthodox approach. Both videos display the band’s love of serpentine beats and menacing synth pads punctuated by swathes of maverick double bass. In addition to the striking music, the videos themselves are incredible — clips which seem to be pulled straight from Norwegian “slow TV” are juxtaposed with unsettling, handwritten phrases and abstract sprays of light. This fits in with the tendency of local avant-garde creators to foray into the world of multimedia, and adds an interesting audio-visual edge to the group’s vision. Keep an eye out for Mixed Signals on the local circuit, as their live show is one of the scene’s most immersive experiences.
Liam Baker:
Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/liambaker.music.poetry/
Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T6r5QiBtww&feature=youtu.be
On the subject of multimedia, Liam Baker is a prolific creator of harrowing music, stunning poetry and exploratory film projects. At first glance, Liam’s music isn’t perhaps as out-there as some of the others on this list, but both his subject matter and his approach to creation are more than deserving of the “experimental” tag; consider the self-made video for ‘Consumatum Est (It Is Over),’ in which Liam sings a funereal melody and accompanies himself on classical guitar from the comfort of his own bathtub. His dynamic live performances consist of spoken word and solemn acoustic ballads, which marry such gloomy subjects as death, drug use and gentrification with a healthy dose of black humour. I once had the pleasure of watching Liam perform to a room full of avid punks and metalheads, and you could literally hear a pin drop from start to end; the remarkably attentive silence was testimony to Liam’s enigmatic stage presence and the powerful delivery of his lines. As with Joe Coghill and Mixed Signals, Liam’s music makes up a small fraction of his overall creative output: he’s one of a select group of all-round creatives who are fully stretching their limits and showcasing the possibilities of being an “artist” on Edinburgh’s underground circuit.

I visited National Museums Scotland (NMS) and Scottish National Gallery (SNG)in Edinburgh and experienced some stunning pieces. Below I have shown and written about a few of the designs I took a liking too from NMS however I couldn’t share any of my favourite pieces from SNG as no photography was allowed due to the possibility of people creating forgeries.
This exact skeleton of the giant deer is the first ever complete version. This was given over to the university of Edinburgh as, at the time (1921), it was one of the world’s best natural history collections. It was then given over to the National Museums Scotland and remains there still. These skeletons are important as they help with discovering what animals have become extinct in the past. What I find most interesting is how fresh and recent this skeleton looks due to how well its been preserved but it is in fact 12,300 years old. I find skeletons like this very interesting as you get to see every tiny (and giant) bone put in the body and see how different and delicately designed every body is. It’s not everyday you have that opportunity. Lastly, I like the placement of this piece as it’s right at the entrance to all the animals exhibits and I feel it’s successful in catching your eye and dragging you towards that area of the museum.
This piece is about our path throughout life. In this you can see the figures in the circles are symbolic for perishing, rebirth and transforming. The golden thread wrapped around the figures is meant to show its leading the way out of this maze, symbolizing their life line. I enjoy this piece through the depth and reality of the meaning Kinnaird brought to it; it really made me reflect on my own life and how fragile it really is. Moreover, the colours are very vibrant and I feel that the prominent red colour suggests blood and health whereas the blues and purples suggest an ambition (possibly to escape the maze?) and peace.
This design is a printed textile piece which was created for Liberty & Co and Hull Traders. The material used was screen-printed woven cotton satin. The main colours used in this piece are pinks, reds and oranges which suggests a warm atmosphere. I think that McNish may have used these colours to match title of “Painted Desert” as when you think of a desert you typically think of an isolated, sandy area where there is a blistering heat. I like the abstract vibe and colour scheme to this piece of design as I feel they are in harmony with each other due to their wild, creative style.
Artist, Eduardo Paolozzi, played around with geometric shapes and designs for this piece with a variety of colours and shades. This particular piece was the first ever designed for Wedgwood. The materials consist of screen-printed porcelain. I am intrigued by Paolozzi’s use of shapes and the intricate detail put into each small section of the plates. Personally, I am a big fan of geometric work and believe that Paolozzi done a fantastic job at presenting his style here. The colours used throughout are mostly warm colours and shades with a few cold colours in contrast which I feel just adds to how eye catching they are.

When I first stepped outside of the Edinburgh Airport, I realized I had no plans on what I wanted to do and see during my short week in the city. I didn’t know anyone else on the trip besides my roommate, and I didn’t know what I would do in Edinburgh. I hadn’t researched much, because my roommate had a million places she wanted to visit. I knew she would pick some pretty stunning attractions as she loves traveling abroad and has done so before.
Our first destination was a two hour walking tour across the city with a lively English tour guide named Georgia. I followed along and found so many beautiful sights; I had my camera open on my phone for the entire two hours! I listened intently as she brought us to each destination, stopping to learn of the city’s history and value. My favorite stop was the Supreme Court of Scotland, a massive stone building with beautiful arched doorways. I turned a full 360 to see it all, and was met with very intricate stained glass windows. We were only there for a few minutes, as we had to make our way through the rest of the city. After a full day of travel, we went home and fell right asleep to prepare for our first full day exploring Edinburgh, Scotland.
The next day we were up bright and early for our first class. The building our classes were held in was full of chandeliers and stunning pink painted walls. I couldn’t believe…

I am writing this from The Elephant Cafe in Edinburgh, famously known as one of the places where J.K. Rowling began crafting the magical world of Harry Potter. Sitting here, surrounded by creativity and history, I found myself reflecting deeply – not on spells or magic, but on something equally powerful: the human experience of pain and suffering.
Pain and suffering are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same. Pain is physiological – it’s a natural part of being alive. We feel it when we are hurt, physically or emotionally. Suffering, on the other hand, is psychological – it is the narrative (our interpretation of the event) we attach to that pain. We suffer when we replay painful events in our minds, hold on to guilt, or worry about an uncertain future.
The truth is, pain is unavoidable, but suffering can be avoided.
The Root of Suffering
Suffering arises when we resist what is. When we wish things were different, when we fight against reality, we create inner turmoil. But when we accept pain as part of our journey, suffering begins to dissolve. Acceptance does not mean we like the pain – it means we stop adding layers of mental and emotional resistance to it.
A Shift in Perspective: We Are Spiritual Beings
What helps me reduce suffering is a spiritual perspective that has profoundly changed my life.
I believe we are spiritual beings having a human experience. Before we are born, our spirit chooses the lessons it needs to learn in this lifetime. It chooses life situations, relationships, and even challenges that are aligned with those lessons. In fact, the more evolved the spirit, the more intense the lessons it chooses.
Think of the world as a giant school, where nearly eight billion unique courses are happening at the same time. Spirit learns these lessons through life situations we experience in our human form. But when we are immersed in the human experience, we forget our true nature. We resist the lessons our spirit came here to learn, and in that resistance, we create suffering. It islike a student refusing to study – he fails and has to repeat the class. Likewise, our soul may have to revisit the same lessons in future lives.
How Do We Break the Cycle?
The key is acceptance – not passive resignation, but deep inner alignment with the purpose of our soul/ spirit. When we stop fighting our circumstances and instead ask, “What is my spirit trying to learn through this?”, we shift our suffering into understanding, and our pain into growth.
Sometimes, the lesson might be patience. Other times, it may be resilience, compassion, or learning to see from a different perspective. When we embrace this idea, we begin to navigate life with more grace and strength.
We may not have control over the cards life deals us, but we do have the power to play them wisely. Life does not expect perfection. It asks only that we do our best, learn, evolve, and keep moving forward. That is all our spirit truly seeks.
Sitting here, inspired by the place where a story changed the world, I hope these reflections help you find your own strength. Whether you are facing pain or walking through suffering, remember: you are not just a body or a mind – you are a spirit on a journey. And every life situation, especially the painful ones, is part of your evolution.

Enjoying an experience is not a constant single note. I enjoyed the break I just took, but I didn’t walk around Edinburgh with a constant fixed grin on my face.
Anyone who says I did — is probably related to me.
I enjoyed the trip there and back as well — slowly, by car, with overnight stops — but the ninety-minute stopped-traffic experience on the M6 isn’t something I will want to replicate if/when there’s a next time.
Having time to ask “Where is the gift in this?” made me notice the light snowstorm of blossom wafting in around us from the verge, but I don’t think I would have ticked the “Stop and notice the flowers” box if I’d been given the option.
For the trip, I hauled out my ancient case of CDs and played them in random order. Some CDs were easy to skip through, but there were a few happy surprises.
I have Dusty Springfield, The Doors, The Stranglers and Deva Premal left over for my next outing in the car. That’ll be a day.
Edinburgh is a tolerant, good-humoured city. I liked the buses (capped fares), and in particular, I liked watching the drivers chatting away (briefly) at their change-overs. Every one of them needed to stop again and adjust their nearside mirror.
I remember Red Kite Cafe for brunch and Cobbled Roastery for coffee and one day we had a good lunch at The Pantry. One night we went all the way to the Radio Rooms in Berwick-upon-Tweed for Hunter & McMustard.
Browsing the shop-fronts in Stockbridge, we talked — somewhat more seriously than not seriously at all — about the distinctive Scottish cuisine that has evolved out of deep-frying everything from Mars bars to pizzas. Do click that second link.
You don’t know until you’ve tried. I wanted to ask what difference air-fryers might make, but missed the moment.
We walked through the Royal Botanic Gardens (without visiting the cafe), and sat for a while on a bench in The Meadows. That was the sunniest day.
Edinburgh is a tolerant, etc., city of cobbled streets, green spaces and small coffee shops and cafes. There’s a National Gallery and a National Portrait Gallery, and in the centre, always bagpipes playing somewhere.
Blackwell’s is the bookshop to visit. There are also Warhammer and Forbidden Planet if you need more storytelling.
I was overnight in a “Single Octo Glamping Pod” at the Drummohr caravan site on the edge of Musselburgh (26 bus into Edinburgh). Fridge, kettle, under-floor heating. Heart 80s Radio playing in the shower block. Their record collection includes Alison Moyet, Human League and Duran Duran; my CD collection doesn’t.
And then the journey home.
Curving motorway through Cumbria and the Lake District — yes, I did stop at Tebay — and then the heavier traffic and older, occasionally elevated, roads through the Midlands, and then — yes, I did stop at Gloucester — the wide open skies and stretching-away rivers of the Somerset Levels.
I spent most of it daydreaming ways in which I was going to be much more efficient when I got home. I would do this, and this, and organise that, and there would be no more procrastination.
And now I’m home.
And I think I’ll be much more efficient — tomorrow.
In case this needs saying, there are no affiliate links in this story. I just got carried away with all the looking-up and linking.
The National Portrait Gallery is worth a visit for the building and the chance to sit down. There’s a cafe. And pictures. Some people are well-served by their portrait artists; some … not so sure.
Lothian Buses runs an ad for its app on a screen in its buses. First, the ad tells you to scan the QR code to get the app, and then — I liked this — the ad gives you detailed instructions on how to scan a QR code.
Helpful. If I’d been staying longer, I would have scanned the QR code.
Or at least, worked out how.

Dear Kin, Supporters, Friends, and Enemies,
Some of you may know I was currently planning to attend the Edinburgh Fringe 2024, with my debut hour “Burning Down The House.”
Some of you may have kindly made a donation to my GoFundMe appeal to get up there. (Will discuss this more & the action plan for it now a bit later in this post).
Some of you may have even experienced a WIP show, where each time a different audience member was comedically “saved,” from the apocalypse/a burning building by the end of the night.
It turns out the person I need to save most is me.
I’ve been doing a very good job at pretending for a while now, that I am not in physical pain from having Covid.
I’ve been in hospital several times for severe pain & breathing problems, there have been times where I’ve found myself unable to function cognitively with brain fog and memory problems, crying in the street unable to make a choice, or know where I am and I was recently diagnosed with Costochondritis, an inflammation of my ribs & chest, that could become chronic and lifelong if I don’t rest & focus on an anti-inflammatory diet & lifestyle.
So in true cosmic joke style it turns out the person on fire the whole time was me!
I have decided to really listen to and prioritise my physical body and needs and dare to imagine what a different way of doing things & living might look like…
I have also realised that so much of my creative work so far has been built on ignoring my body, it’s needs & any physical or emotional pain I might actually be in.
I wonder what kind of creative work I would make if I wasn’t always in survival mode?
What kind of work would I make if the source of all my material wasn’t just trauma & pain?
What would I make if my life was more easeful, held and had community, care & joy in it?
I have to admit for a long time now, sustaining a creative career in the arts has largely involved me pretending I am on an equal footing to others, when in fact I’ve been struggling with access to affordable stable housing & a lack of any supportive, nourishing context in my personal life, that would make true exploration, risk taking, play and expression possible.
Like many others I have bought into the punishing story that if I just worked hard enough, or contorted myself correctly, at some point my day would come..I’d get the shot to express myself, or say something, or be met with the resources that could liberate me from the chaos of surviving and afford to buy a stable home.
But right now my body is howling, saying what about now?
What about living right now?
And making choices that mean no one gets burned down in the making of things.
If the price of success and “a future” is your physical health, I’d say it’s too high.
My people pleasing self, still worried about letting people down, sat on the floor crying, making up excuses & justifications and blatant lies for how much ibuprofen could achieve!? How I had been met with motivating external validation in getting so many people to help fund this & bring it to life…
Including a network of incredible humans on a GoFundMe page & the Phoebe Waller-Bridge spirit of the fringe fund (it’s not called that I know, but I’m an annoying twat and I’ve been enjoying pissing people off by calling it the Hot fleabag priest award).
I also got some money from the Best in Class bursary, I have a big supportive agent & a lush director offering her time & energy for free…all these resources and a good venue and time slot, so that should make it ok to destroy myself right!?
Because I’m so bloody lucky!?
Yet with all of those things combined: A GoFundMe, a working class bursary, money from the fleabag God’s, an agent who will front some costs, a director in kind…I’m still only half way there to covering it!
With costs of accommodation & venue/tech/marketing fees, I’m still looking at coming away pulverised and in debt or best case scenario breaking even with a side of burnt ribs.
Also I simply cannot push or mask anymore, there’s not enough caffeine, ibuprofen or sugar that would get me through!
I should clarify here. The fleabag hot priest award will be returned to someone who needs it (don’t think it’s even arrived yet) and I’ve just returned the Best in Class bursary.
Also I am going to explain the options for the amazingly generous GoFundMe donations here:
I raised a whopping 2,319 quid on my Go Fund Me from some deeply generous souls, in a challenging time for many with rising living costs.
I’d love to return these funds to anyone who needs it, my email address is: charliegeorgecomedy@gmail.com please send me your bank details and I will be able to do this for you, please please don’t be afraid to do this, if you need it, it’s yours.
Another option available is that I had already started to make lifestyle changes as advised by medical professionals I’d seen since having Covid and begun reducing my gig schedule and volunteering at a local farm near where I live in Kent.
Getting my hands in the soil has been so healing for my nervous system and breathing and learning about growing has been transformational even in a short time.
This farm is challenging the “cost of living” crisis by providing affordable veg box schemes to the local community & offering some free in partnership with a local food bank. I’d love to offer your donations to this & my continued work with it, as they are doing great things for the community.
If you’d be happy for this option, you can also email me & I will ensure it goes there and can keep you updated on the work we’re doing. I regularly post pictures from there on insta anyway covered in dirt!
I was also going to offer another option of me doing a more accessible version of the show with access needs considered in London and this money would go towards that!…
But let me discuss that with my agent team and see what’s possible for showcasing my stand up in an accessible way and I will keep you posted/do an announcement…
Many of you know I’m late diagnosed neurodivergent and am committed to access & disability so would love to do something that supported other people who are living with chronic conditions who would find a festival environment too challenging to see work in…watch this space!
For now, I’m not sure where I’m at with gigs and gig life and the toll it takes on the body…
I’m honouring my final few contracted commitments over the summer, with lots of space for rest, healing and recovery in between.
My body has said a clear no to this model & format for expression right now.
Maybe yours says yes!
If so I salute you, go for it, play, experiment, take big risks, have fun!
All we have is now.
Say what you want to say & bring forth your gifts.
I still believe we all have them and they all have equal value and worth.
I love the arts & creative expression, it has always given me the opportunity, the dignity & the daring to examine, express and celebrate life!
I’ll never stop making.
I just need to find a different, healthier, slower way…
So for now, I’m out of the game.
Thanks for all your support and/or hatred of me & my work thus far, it’s all been really useful for the soil!
x Big Love.

After a few months of absence from posting anything on Medium or my WordPress blog, I am hoping the past week marks a turning point. This writing hiatus has been mainly due to dealing with the shock and grief of my dear sister’s death in December, exacerbated by what I am calling Political Depression: a feeling of paralysis in the face of catastrophic global events (about which I hope to write soon). And losing the inspiration I found from my experience of moving from Sheffield to the Aberdeenshire coast: once I had seen a full year through, I felt I have nothing new to say.
Nothing to do but to get away! It’s been hard to make time for a break for various reasons, but last week we managed to book a couple of nights in Edinburgh, a city we barely know, and do a pure tourist visit.
Just coming out of Waverley station into the spring sunshine with the expansive haven of Princes Street Gardens running through the city centre, and the castle on the rocky mound above, was an immediate lift to the spirits.

Outside of the United States, Scotland is the country that I have visited more often than any other, and has become my favorite.
Give me a moment to try and persuade you to give this rainy, northern country a chance!
They may not be your average beaches, but they are important! The ocean here is both beautiful and the main reason for Scotland’s concise temperature range and rainy weather.
Here are a few photos from Edinburgh, Scotland’s capital. There is so much history in the major cities, as well as the towns and villages.

If I see one more Instagram post with the caption “Sing me a song of a lass that is gone” I’ll scream.
Scotland is full of tourists, taking snaps and posting them, but I’ve noticed one thing when I read about their trips.
They hardly ever mention Glasgow.
Have you even really seen Scotland if you haven’t been to Glasgow? A lot of people seem to think “it’s a waste of time” that could be better spent in Edinburgh or Glen Coe. Or checking off Outlander locations.
They are so wrong. Add it to your bucket list. Stay a while and absorb the vibe of the city. Glasgow rewards time spend there — and you will fall in love with the place!
Well, Outlander did get one thing right — Scotland is a tribal culture!
Think about the football teams. Rangers vs Celtic; Hearts vs Hibs. If you want to avoid a fight make sure you say you support Partick Thistle. All of this is based on old sectarian rivalries. Protestants vs Catholics.
But there’s city rivalry too. Glasgow is the friendly, blue-collar, ‘real’ Scotland. Edinburgh people are…

It was great to meet more of the Travel Massive community at Travel Massive Edinburgh’s first event of 2021, on Thursday 28 January.
After introductions and updates from the Travel Massive Edinburgh chapter leaders Lesley, Susan and Katy, with a focus on the role of communities, including Travel Massive and Women in Tourism, we heard from Susan Russell, Head of Marketing, Underbelly, on how for the first time, Edinburgh’s Hogmanay had gone completely digital in 2020.
Susan shared some of the impressive audience engagement statistics and reminded us of the powerful combination of drone technology, poetry, music and film in the video clips she shared. We learned that the Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well piece has been viewed over 6.2 million times (direct views) on social channels and has generated around 650 pieces of media coverage. 150 drones were used in the piece, and this was Scotland’s first ever swarm drone show.
Josh Ryan-Saha, Director of Traveltech for Scotland, introduced the cluster’s aims and objectives and shared updates, also focusing on the power of community and letting people know how they can get involved.
We were then introduced to one of the entrepreneurs in the Traveltech for Scotland community, Elaine Ford, who shared information about her early-stage start-up, Electrek Explorer, a mobile app for electric vehicle tourism, offering opportunities for collaboration across the tourism sector in Scotland and striving to develop a solution towards a greener economy.
The event generated some great industry chat and facilitated valuable connections between members which was great to see. We look forward to more events in partnership with the Travel Massive community and thanks also to Ian Cumming and Maria Stoyanova of Travel Massive for their isupport for Traveltech for Scotland.
Watch the Travel Massive Edinburgh event recap video here, catch Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well again, including the poetry and music from the event. Watch Elaine Ford talk about start-up Electrek Explorer.

Last year in May, I traveled to the magical city of Edinburgh, Scotland. While it wasn’t my first time there — I had spent my birthday there the year before — I was excited to be going back to immerse myself in the city’s rich history and culture as much as I could.
The primary reason why I went back was Beyonce. Edinburgh was one of the stops of the European leg of her Renaissance World Tour, and since Dublin wasn’t one of them, I bought the tour tickets to the closest city — after all, Edinburgh is only 50 minutes away from the Irish capital by plane.
Whenever I think of this trip, I get super emotional. I lived some of the best five days of my life in ways I can’t fully express. Starting with the city itself as it is absolutely stunning. It is my favorite city in the UK for its majestic, medieval, Georgian, and neoclassical architecture and rich history. Walking in Edinburgh feels like a scene out of a movie where you’re the main character. Ok, the accent might be a struggle at first, but I always found the locals to be friendly and patient, making it easy to navigate and connect.
Secondly, the day of the concert — as well as all the previous Beyonce-themed parties I attended there —…

“Piled deep and massy, close and high; Mine own romantic town”
-Sir Walter Scott, Marmion
In Peterborough, the station where I had transferred onto my train, I had thought about how the blankets of grey across the sky do not mean gloom. They just mean a cloudy day. Yes, no sun. But also, no sun in my eyes. The muted tones were becoming synonymous with the UK in my mind.
But that day, by the time the train was gliding toward Edinburgh, those grey clouds had broken up enough that tides of sunlight washed over the land between them. The hills and farmland sped by, but I was sitting still. Laughter bounced up the cabin. A family was sitting behind me a few rows back, and at the heart of their babble was a high note of wonder — a little girl, enraptured by everything.
“Woooah! Woooah!”
“It’s another train!” exclaimed a deep, gravely voice. He animated his voice to match her bright wonder.
“Look grampy,” she chimed, “here it comes! WOOOAH!!”
Their chatter pulsed through the continuous hum of the train, then fell back under it again and again, as tidal as the waves of sunlight breaking through outside. Occasionally, amused laughter burst from the whole group. I smiled. The world was new and bright to her, and she was bringing that gift to the whole cabin. It was going to be a good weekend, I thought. Later, a group of rowdy guys took their place in the back. It wasn’t hard to make out their loud voices, but I could only understand every fourth word through their thick Scottish accents.
When I got off the train in Edinburgh, I was surprised to find a flood of people exiting the station with me, many of them donning green and orange. The woman in the tourist information booth told me there was a big rugby match today: Six Flags Ireland vs. Scotland. Luckily these crowds only brought their excitement and energy, no disruptions or hassles for me.
Emerging from the station into Edinburgh was quite dramatic. In addition to the pockets of heart-warming human interaction I encountered on the train, arriving that way was worth it just for the visual effect. Waverly station is right in the middle of Old Town and runs underneath Edinburgh castle. So, when I walked up to street level, the slope to the castle and through romantic old buildings was my first impression of the city. One thing I loved about Edinburgh was its geography. It sits under the watch of two extinct volcanoes — the smaller Castle Rock to the West, where the castle sits, and Arthur’s Seat to the East, a much higher and windier hill that stands over the official residence of the royal family in Scotland. Other hills rise around the center like hands of the land cupping the city in its palm. Some of the houses spill out of the land’s grasp and trickle around the coast of the North Sea.
The entrance to my hostel was nestled right underneath the Castle. I was met by a friendly reception immediately inside the door. To the right was the check-in desk, to the left was a locked cage full of big backpacks and sacks. Passed that was the kitchen door. People were coming and going with cups of afternoon coffee. The receptionists asked where I was from. I told them I was American but studying abroad in London. Ah, gotcha, they said, cool. With swarms of young people arriving from all over the world, I’m sure they had heard that story many times. After getting my key, I wandered further underground, passed a couple of themed lounges with high ceilings, and reached a narrow, traditional-looking staircase.
The room was large and filled with at least eight sets of bunk beds. Each had a storage compartment, a safe, charging outlets by the bed, and a curtain to maintain some sense of privacy. And, since this floor’s theme was Harry Potter, my bed had a wooden nametag that said “Ron Weasley.” They didn’t skimp on décor, because the walls were spattered with murals. The hostel became a home base with a strangely easy sense of community.
Edinburgh itself seemed to have an easy way about it. I mostly wandered around during my visit, and it was all lovely. The Royal Mile, a straight street at the center of Old Town, entertained me for an entire afternoon. With Six Nations going on, the number of kilted bagpipers on the street was probably double the normal. As soon as one was out of earshot, I’d catch the notes of another just up ahead for continuous ambiance. There were bookshops and whiskey tours and fabric stores filled with traditionally woven plaid fabric, kilts, and everything else. I finished my first night with dinner at the pub and a pool game with some rugby fans at the hostel and went to bed exhausted.
On my second day, I visited the Scottish National Gallery, took a bus to New Town just to see the difference, and walked up Calton Hill to see the unfinished National Monument. Bundled up, eyes watering from the wind, I watched a group of older and younger kids try to clamber up the bracket of the monument’s huge foundation. The older kids, already on top, were weaving around the giant stone pillars, trying to reach around them and touch each other’s hands from opposite sides. They couldn’t do it and broke out in laughter at their failure.
By the time they left, the sun had set. Above the reach of any streetlights, the hill was becoming so dark that I could no longer make out the people fifteen feet in front of me. I almost climbed on top of the monument but awkwardly slipped down a couple times. I chuckled at myself because I had thought that I would do better than those kids. I held onto the pillar to feel like the wind wouldn’t push me off the hill, and then I looked toward the city. The lights were all on — human constellations shining through the thick night where the stars faintly answered back. The horizon line between them was a yellow glow over Edinburgh. I took a breath in, then sat down, taking it in until my body could not warm itself against the cold wind anymore.
On my last day, I took another wander around Edinburgh, scooting between the old buildings that sat almost on top of each other, and found other streets, apartment courtyards, and secret allies. Back on a main street, I found a small old church, which was no longer a church and now had a souvenir shop and UNESCO Heritage display set up inside. I wandered around and tried to imagine the kinds of people who would have gathered here when it had first been built.
I saved Arthur’s Seat for last. After my night on top of the National Monument, it seemed like the perfect way to take in the city one last time. Every stranger I met eyes with shared the same spark of exhilaration that I felt on those windy, open hills. Everyone couldn’t help but smile. Besides feeling like I was going to get blown off the mountain, the most memorable moment was thanks to a man who was out for a run.
He was wearing just a tiny pair of running shorts and shoes; he let his long hair do whatever it wanted. He zipped passed me and a couple that I had made friends with as we were climbing up to the actual “seat” of Arthur’s Seat. By the time we got one bend away from the top, we could look ahead and see that he had stopped to enjoy the view in a rather unorthodox way. I have to note here that I cannot over-exaggerate how windy it was; I was scared to stand near the edge of any hill, afraid I might literally be blown over by its force. This man had walked out to the very edge of the cliff and was perched on it with his legs slightly ahead of his body and his arms behind him, gripping the rock face. His hair was wildly whipping in the wind, and he was bellowing at the top of his lungs toward the city. The sound of his voice came in faint wisps when the wind blew it our way, but it was definitely a blood-curdling howl. He looked like a wild man that had crawled from a cave in the Scottish hills. We walked around the bend and lost sight of him for about a hundred feet, but we saw that he was still screaming when we got to the peak of the hill. And he hadn’t stopped when we kept going and eventually lost sight of him for good. Well, he’s either a little insane or he knows something the rest of us don’t, I thought. Most likely both.
You can just make him out in the picture below.
The train back glided through darkness, so instead of gazing out the window, I read my book and wrote in my journal about how I didn’t want to go back to reality. This time it wasn’t a little girl and her family, but a tired boy and his father still painted blue for the game. The boy fell asleep before their stop and his dad scooped his floppy little body up to leave. I used to pretend that I was asleep so my mom would carry me inside and tuck me in bed, and I wondered if he was using the same tactics.
On my second and longer train back to London, I fell back into my journaling and back into deep thought. The gentleman in the booth across the aisle from me was reading with his brows gently knitted together. A woman came along. She was loud, friendly, maybe ten years older than me, American. She asked the man if the seat across from him was taken; he shook his head and returned to his reading. She announced that she was whooped and was therefore going to the concession car to get a beer and we would like one too. The man accepted, I politely declined. Was I sure, she asked. Yes, thank you, I replied.
It was uncomfortable to be yanked from my thoughts by her conversation, but she slowly drew me in as she broke through small talk with the old man and got on to more interesting things. She knew I was listening, I think, and continued to address me across the aisle with a nod or a glance. She began talking about her plans to take a trip to the highlands with her friends, then the man revealed that he was from northern Scotland and could tell her all about the highlands. With that, I finally joined in.
We listened to his descriptions of the highlands, we asked each other questions, we shared opinions and plans, and we began to feel like we had always been this familiar with each other. They finished their drinks, and at some point they both got off at their stops. I was left with my own thoughts again, but this time they swam around with something deeper. And that something made me thank the world for long train rides and friendly strangers.

Scomo collapsed from a heart attack near the new commercial center that he detested. Hurried and busy pedestrians left him there, figuring he was a drunken tramp, until a feeble-minded woman knelt to care for him and discovered he was dead.
That’s how the writer George Scott-Moncrieff died in Edinburgh in 1974.
He loved Edinburgh, even though bulldozers and commercial developers had wrecked large parts of it.
Edinburgh is still lovable today despite the commercial-fueled bulldozer, says Alexander Larman in a recent essay in The Spectator, noting that Scotland’s capital “comes into its own” at New Years.
The Scots call the New Years “Hogmanay” and it consists of two days that the Scots celebrate like their Irish cousins celebrate March 17th.
Larman recommends Edinburgh at Hogmanay . . . or at any time.
“It’s a seductive place to visit,” says Larman, given its “combination of Georgian architecture, world-class museums and galleries, some fine independent shops, and top-notch restaurants and bars.”
If you’re going to Edinburgh, Larman recommends you take the train from London.
And if you can afford it, go first class on the London North Eastern Railway. It takes four hours, but it’s a great four hours.

Four days earlier in the early morning of Sunday 30th July I’d arrived at Davenant Foundation School in Loughton east London. The location for the start of the 2017 London — Edinburgh — London Audax. One of Britain’s greatest cycling challenges, the route stretches over 1400km between the two capitals taking in some of the most stunning scenery the UK has to offer.
It’s a simple concept. You just need to collect a stamp on the brevet card at each of the 19 checkpoints along the route and complete the ride in 100 elapsed hours. (A 116 hour time limit is an option but, in for a penny…)
Prior to this I’d never ridden anything on such a scale. I’d completed multi-day stage races, but they involved only 3–4 hours in the saddle each day. Similarly with Lands End — John O’Groats which I completed 15 years previous. Riding for just 6–8 hours a day leaves plenty of time for recovery and feeding.
Breaking this ride down in the months prior to the start, it looked straightforward. A schedule of somewhere in the region of 350km per day for four days. Factor in the cumulative fatigue and the forecast bad weather, however, and things start to look interesting.
I started well. From a 07:15 roll out I covered 340km to Pocklington by about 21:30. Helped by an always-welcome tailwind and fresh legs, the miles slipped by — especially in the Fens north of Cambridge and up through Lincolnshire to the Wolds.
I had picked up a ride partner in the Fens; a guy from Manchester. Initially I had plans of continuing to Thirsk but he was keen to stop. I knew there were lumpy roads to come so decided to get a bed at Pocklington. I slept reasonably well — helped by the earplugs provided by the organisers.
Clear, dry and mild. The road to Thirsk was in poor condition and given that I’d have been riding it in the dark I was glad of my decision not to continue the previous night.
The first big hill of the ride came out of Barnard Castle. A long drag followed by Yad Moss. By this point the cross-tailwind we’d enjoyed further south had shifted to a cross/cross-head as we’d turned north west. Yad Moss became a savage drag all the way from High Force up to the top. The descent was quick, though the wind took the edge off top end speed.
I was expecting the weather to be poor in Brampton. But it was one of the warmest places on the whole ride. A quick stop for food and a stamp in the brevet card and onwards to Moffat.
I’d ridden the road to Moffat 15 years previously on my End-to-End jaunt. Let’s call it utilitarian. It’s pretty featureless and seems to be littered with truck stops. The route had turned north again meaning the wind was mostly to our sides and backs. Progress was quick but my ride partner from Manchester dropped away, complaining of aggravating a historic injury.
I reached Moffat soon after 20:00, my ride partner following slightly later informing me of his decision to bail. He was disappointed, as was I for him. All the preparation and build up to not even reach the half way point.
I rolled out of the control on my own as the sun was setting.
Continuing on the route of my ride 15 years earlier, I remembered the road out of Moffat to be glorious. A lovely, steady gradient up Devil’s Beef Tub through beautiful scenery. This particular evening there was hardly a car to be seen and just a couple of other riders’ flashing rear lights in the distance for company. Throw in a lovely sunset and still air; this was pretty close to cycling nirvana.
Descending the other side I passed a rider stopped at the side of the road. The reply to the usual “Got everything you need?” wasn’t the standard “Yeah, thanks.” but “Actually, no!” Heaving on the anchors I met Mike who was on puncture number six of the ride and had ruined his tyre levers.
I leant him my box-fresh set and before long we were both rolling towards Edinburgh, arriving soon after 01:00.
Day three slapped us in the face with a 06:00 wake up to wet weather after four hours sleep.
Turning south meant the wind would mostly be in our faces or, at best, cross-head. The road out of Edinburgh down to Innerleithen and then Eskdalemuir beyond was lumpy and windy. The rain passed and the sun shone occassionally between the dark clouds. The scenery was beautiful: rugged, bleak and remote. My legs took some time to come to me, the first three hours were hard but by lunch I’d recovered some form.
The checkpoints passed. I ate a lot of food; pretty much a three course meal with a side of carbs. at each stop. 8–9000 calories a day is a lot to replace.
Brampton was reached around mid-afternoon. After thinking this would be one of the wettest points on the route it had turned out to be not just dry but also very warm. I had a bag left at this control so changed into fresh kit (mmmmmmm!) and rolled out in the direction of Alston.
Yad Moss. Again. The windy, bleak slog-fest on the way north was playing on my mind. I needed to get over this and make good time towards Thirsk for the night.
The climb south wasn’t anywhere near as brutal as the route north. It seemed to pass quickly and with relative ease. Riding along the top was beautiful. So much so that I stopped to take one of my few photographs from the ride.
The day ended in Thirsk some time after 01:00. A huge feed and four hours sleep later, we were back on the road just after 06:30.
430km to do. This was it. At 11:15 the last 24 hours in which to complete this ride would begin its count down.
The roads were relatively flat down to the Humber Bridge from Thirsk. But then it started to get interesting. The wind was straight into our faces. Unrelenting like the little climbs; some up to 15%. Up and down we went. Small groups forming on the road to help each other to the next control at Louth.
By Louth stories were coming back from the Fens about the ferociousness of the wind. Tired bodies were scattered around the control. Allegiances were being made to ride across the Fens as groups. Strength in numbers.
I grew up on the edge of the Fens. It’s my natural riding environment. The opposite of the high mountains. Flat roads providing an opportunity to ride steady state for hours on end—more suited to my 78kg. Throw in the promise of wind and I was secretly relishing what was to come.
We gathered our group together and rolled out of Louth in the late afternoon.
The road to Spalding was as advertised. I did a 35km turn on the front of our group. For that hour and a half I was riding a spring Classic in Belgium; driving the head of the bunch, putting everyone in dificulties. Although I was really just holding a steady 22–25kmh and giving four others shelter.
Spalding was reached as the sun was going down.
180km to go. We started to formulate plans. Short stops at the control and a two to three hour sleep before London? Or, slightly longer stops at each control but continue all night to the finish? We opted for the latter.
And so we settled in for the night shift.
The wind continued and it started to rain but spirits were high. The group chatted and rotated turns on the front.
As the hours passed and the tiredness crept in, the chatter decreased and we became more singularly focussed on keeping tidy in the group. Don’t fall asleep. Hold the wheel. Breathe the chilly air deeply to keep the senses alert.
We gathered waifs and strays as we rode. All looking for company and the relative saftey of a large group with our combined illumination on the dark, potentially dangerous, roads of south Lincolnshire.
The last control points passed in a blur of tiredness.
Stop, get card stamped, take on caffeine, eat whatever is plain and easy to get down, get back on the bike, continue riding south.
The sun rose as we approached Great Easton. The final control before home. There were some seriously tired bodies. People catching 20 minutes sleep sat at their bowl of cereal. I was falling asleep. A double shot espresso gel saved for this very occasion perked me up and we headed off for the final 48km of this monster ride.
We rolled into Davenant School at 08:32 on Thursday 3 August. Card stamped at 08:35. 97 hours and 20 minutes after I’d rolled out of the gates.
What. A. Ride.
Here are a few hints and tips that worked well for me in the build up to, and during, the event. With something like this, everyone has their own approach so take what you like from the below. Your mileage will likely vary.
I carried arm, leg and knee warmers with me on the bike at all times. Add in a gillet, rain cape and wet weather gloves and I was fine for cool night riding and wet weather. Maintenance wise: Three spare tubes (only one used), CO2, multi-tool, tyre levers(!), cable ties, electrical insulation tape, spare cable, pucture repair kit.
I carried small packets of Dove wet wipes with me. They helped keep myself clean between applications of chamois cream which, by the end of the ride, was twice a day. They’re also great for moisturising after a day of wind burn. My wife told me to take lip balm but I forgot it. And boy did I finish with chapped lips! Take lip balm! Even a quick teeth clean at a control gives you an extra 2km/h for the next hour or so. So, small tube of tooth paste and tooth brush.
The food supplied at the controls is excellent. Pasta bakes, chicken supreme with rice, mild curries with rice, rice puddings, sponge puddings with custard, porridge, cereal, hot drinks, loads of fresh fruit and cereal/flapjack bars of all varieties for between controls.
You can see the bike I rode above. It performed fautlessly. Disc brakes really are excellent in wet weather and especially so when you don’t get to clean your bike between wet rides. None of that scretchy, gritty brake block on rims. The dynamo front hub meant I never had to worry about power for phone or Garmin. Although, make sure you get everything charged during the day so the light is at full power at night. I rode 39/53 and 29/11 never feeling over geared.
I have a day job and a busy family life. I don’t have the luxury of being able to string together huge rides regularly. I did one 440km ride and a few 100–200km back to back rides. I think the most effective training I did was a few 200–400km rides on 4 hours sleep in the two months leading up to L-E-L.
I used a Garmin 810 and saved each leg so as not to overload it. Rides longer than 100km seem to make my Garmin turn off and dump the data. I strung them together using FIT tools for the Strava bragging rights.
I found the organisation of the event to be excellent across every dimension. The vounteers were outstanding at every control. They seemed to really enjoy their roles and nothing was ever too much effort at whatever time of day or night. Outstanding!

From the moment we all sat down around the table brainstorming, it was clear to us that everyone had a completely different idea on the task in hand. Some thought it was to find an obscure tourist experience, whilst myself and others thought it was maybe an app or something completely apart from the norm that would allow tourists to explore their surroundings.
To narrow our ideas down we brought in the help of a lecture to clarify the desired output from the task. It was at this point that we decided to Jazz up the idea of a day trip in the city, including Maps and Apps.
The main idea from the start was to have different independent business join together to create a day experience for tourists who wanted to see that REAL Edinburgh, and not the Edinburgh focused on chains and high street brands.
After becoming fairly confident on the idea we asked our Italian group member, Cecilia, to ask her friends and people she knew back home what they thought of this idea. The idea was given a positive backing so therefore we decided to go ahead with this.
We decided a walk round of Edinburgh would be beneficial to us and would allow us to gauge what independent businesses, obscure places we would like to have in our day trip.
We decided that best way to display/present our idea was to given an example of one of many day trips to see the REAL Edinburgh.
After deciding on the places we decided on a route that made the most sense and also fitted into the time slot of 10am — 10pm. By deciding on this route, it allowed us to create a map that would give the tourists an outline for their day trip whilst also giving them a memento of memorial value.
We decided that these maps could be picked up from Haymarket — The starting point of the trip — and each map would have a different day trip on each.
The day trip for our presentation was as follows
Overall the group worked Hard as a team and met on multiple occasions where one team member was unable to attend due to other commitments whilst keeping them in the loop via Facebook group chats.
Due to all 4 of us missing the primary lecture where the brief was given we felt behind on this task and worked extremely hard to be up to date and produce an Alternative tourist experience.
I feel with more time this idea could have been given a fully functioning app which worked in conjunction with the maps allowing tourists to build up a bank of obscure places and independent business’s creating a very personal memory bank.

Having spent some formative years in this charming, if often understated, city I fell deeply for the green & grey charms of the Scottish Capital which I for about four years called home.As I have to regularly update on Prague Superguide, a guidebook on Prague I publish, I find it helpful to exercise by writing brief snippets and tips on other cities I visited and loved. I do it for friends but also for me, to remind myself of the useful or the good stuff when needed.And during the current pandemics, I thought why not to share it with others, too?

Photography Walks: Edinburgh, Scotland
Walk Two: A Picturebook of a Short Stay in Scotland’s capital
It started out as a treat for our 12 year old daughter. She wanted to see the pandas in Edinburgh Zoo which is 245 miles (395K) away! A fresh urgency to fulfilling this request was the forthcoming removal of the pandas back to China.
We decided that a couple of nights stay was required and set off early on day one. The delights of an Air B+B awaited us. We are non-smokers and chose a non-smoking flat. The previous visitors clearly had no regard for this and the flat stank. And in the second bedroom the broken blind was hidden in the wardrobe. Grrrr. Open windows, emergency window coverings, copious amounts of air freshener and complaints to the owner. Well, we’ll never stay there again! Air B+B has served us well over the years but not this time.
As well as the zoo and pandas our daughter’s idea of a good time is shopping for clothes. So after the zoo mum and daughter went shopping and I took the opportunity to wander with my camera and catch up with them here and there.
One thing we did together was to visit the Royal Yacht Britannia which is now a tourist attraction on Edinburgh’s docks. Retired…

I stood shivering next to the sea at Wardie Bay, a huge grin plastered across my face. I had just done my first ever cold dip. My husband was looking at me bemused, surprised I had actually done it (we both know I’m more of a cup-of-tea-on-the-sofa type). I felt emotional, thinking about all the life we had squeezed into the past year and aware that our time in Edinburgh was coming to an end.
In April 2024 I moved from London to Edinburgh and now, just a little over a year later, I have moved back.
When I told people about this move their first question would often be ‘have you moved for work?’ To which I would reply ‘no, I moved for fun and work moved with me!’ Relocating to Edinburgh wasn’t driven by a job offer and it wasn’t a strategic career move. It was a move led by life.
Our tenancy agreement in London was coming to an end, we weren’t quite ready to buy and when it came to thinking about where to rent next I floated a question: ‘shall we leave London?’
We toyed with some more exotic options, but settled on the land of the deep fried mars bar and tattie scone. This was partly because I had visited Edinburgh before and always felt at home in the city. But it was also partly practical: it’s English-speaking, there was much more likelihood of us keeping our jobs, it’s not too far and it’s low risk because as a tenant you can hand in your notice and leave within 28-days (yes, really… Scotland does things better).
Both Jason (the husband) and I got the move signed off by work, bundled our possessions into the car and journeyed north.
Although lots of people have been delighted by our move, some have been a bit perplexed. Aside from the fact that we chose Scotland (why not Lisbon or Paris or somewhere… sunny?), and the fact we made the move knowing it would be temporary (why go to all that effort?), there was a third oddity tugging at people’s minds: why did we move if it wasn’t for work?
I find that last reaction particularly interesting, as it hints at a wider cultural phenomenon. Today, a large part of our identity is tied up in what we do for a living. Even that phrase ‘for a living’ doesn’t really make sense anymore — do we really just work for a living? Or do we work for a sense of self, the desire for fulfilment and, in some cases, the drive to attain a certain social status?
There is, of course, a mounting counter-movement that is pushing back against the way work is swallowing our lives whole, for example the rise of the four-day work week, or the increase in remote-working — which is expected to grow 25% by 2030. Demand for jobs with flexibility is on the rise, suggesting that more of us want to fit work around life, rather than the other way around.
As someone who has pivoted their career to the social/ environmental impact sector, it would be quite ironic if I thought that working for a bigger purpose was a bad thing. Of course I don’t. But I do believe that you can be career-motivated in general, and still seek out life experiences that have nothing to do with job prospects and may, even, negatively impact your career, albeit temporarily.
The important point is that it’s not a zero-sum game, it’s a pendulum swing. Sometimes work leads, sometimes it’s adventure and sometimes other responsibilities will take the limelight. (Or at least that’s how I think it should be).
We rented a flat in New Town, working from there most days, occasionally taking our laptops to nearby coffee shops. My arrangement with work was that I would come down to London once a month and spend two days in the office (the typical policy is two days a week in office). When I was in London it was chaotic and jam-packed, but when I returned to Edinburgh it was quiet and much more spontaneous (thanks to few social obligations).
Overall though, I would do it again in a heartbeat.
Not everyone has the ability to up and move — whether due to work, medical needs or the reality of family life, so understandably this is a privileged position to be in.
If you are in a position to prioritise an adventure — however big or small — here are some tips:
My time in Edinburgh isn’t a footnote, it’s a full chapter in my book of life. I still care deeply about my work, especially when it comes to using my working life to make a positive difference (however small), but I also care about living with intention.
And if you’ve made it this far, maybe you’re ready to do the same.
Why not try…
There’s more where that came from, so if you’re planning a trip don’t be afraid to ask for recommendations!

I made a new friend by happenstance. Recently I accidentally destroyed an old, precious book of mine, and April Smith, owner of Booksmith Conservation, restores them for a living (beautifully, I might add). She also completed an archaeological dig at the Macedonia-Greece border in the 1990s (!!🤓) — one of the places I will expand my research to in the coming years. Plus, her job is so cool; I was friendly-jealous and mesmerized by the process of book preservation. She’s taking a trip to Scotland this summer, and I remembered that I have a list of spots and tips I curated a while back for friends visiting the Highlands and Edinburgh I haven’t shared here yet. I wrote this quickly, soon after my last trip there (pre-COVID), but I imagine many of the same general things still apply. So it’s a bit hodge-podge in style, structure, and content, but that’s because Scotland trips don’t really need to be planned — Scotland plans you.
Highlands Lodging:
One thing to keep in mind is that most bed and breakfasts in the Highlands are not yet online (weirdly) — so we thought Portree was all booked up before arriving, but you really can show up, and all the hundreds of B&Bs you pass will have either a “vacancy” sign or a “no vacancy” sign. It’s a nice system if you want to walk around a bit and meet the (very kind) owners, who are always willing to let you glance at the room and see if it’s charming enough to suit your needs before locking in the (very affordable) deal.
Basically, this is my way of saying don’t pre-book anything in the Highlands. Just follow your intuition and let yourself be guided by the lovely locals.
Highlands Info:
Oban is spectacular. It won’t be difficult, but be sure you catch the sunset there. It’s life changing. And if possible, have fish ‘n chips from a place that has fresh catches every day.
The Isle of Skye is also gorgeous —even if you have gray weather (like we did), it comes in spurts and doesn’t really rain that hard, so don’t let it keep you inside. Bring a billed rain jacket if you have one—it’s what everyone wears.
I don’t know where you’re planning to stay, but I strongly suggest having dinner in Portree at least once. There is such an impressive collection of high-end seafood restaurants concentrated there. We found a new one we recommend the highest — but I’m sure they are all good. There are several fish ‘n chips places, too — but I had the best fish ‘n chips I’ve ever had in the little take-it-to-go place in the center if Portree. You’ll notice it just by walking around for five minutes because Portree is small. They definitely have fresh fish every day, most often from only an hour ago. Add the salt and vinegar and order a side of any of the homemade sauces that you tend to like elsewhere (like tartar sauce or curry sauce).
If you want to do a tour of Talisker, you’ll have to book it in advance — our way of seeing the distilleries was actually to just go to the bar and order a flight. Talisker’s bar wasn’t finished yet, but if you’re interested in buying a bottle, they will give you a taste. Talisker is the famous one, though, so it's a bit touristy (still worth a stop!). I enjoyed the smaller distilleries better — they were friendlier and felt more Scottish.
In general, when driving, don’t be afraid to make unplanned stops along the way! We found several little hiking paths that were well-marked and let you choose via signposts “waterfall versus lair,” etc. all along the way. We also made an unplanned stop in the (very small) town of Sligachan on Skye where we could try any whisky our heart desired for very cheap. The town is basically a little rest stop close to Talisker, but worth spending some time in if you don’t get to do a tour of Talisker (we skipped it). In short, the Highlands are perfect for exploring.
I’m sure you will learn this when you arrive, but just to give you a taste of the mantra: “There are no trespassing laws in Scotland” — so you can literally walk anywhere, go through any gate, and explore wherever your heart desires. The farmers you meet encourage it — and seem to be proud of this aspect of Scotland. They will tell you if the bulls are out (and still, you can go through), but otherwise, they truly don’t mind you taking hikes through their incredible properties, which, together, make up Scotland. :)
Portree Restaurants:
I was told the best ones are №1 and Scorrybreac restaurants, but we didn’t book in advance, and in the summertime, they tend to be full, so we didn’t get to try them.
There are several restaurants nearby of a similar caliber, which we just walked past and begged for a reservation at dinner time (most were full).
We ended up trying Dulce and Brose with reservations one evening. It was overhyped but still tasty. We also tried another one by waiting in the bar area until they gave us a table — and it was so good that we added it to Google Maps and gave it its first 5-star review. It was seriously amazing. The name is Caroy House (it’s in cursive and super nondescript, so easy to miss, but worth finding!!). I recommend the smoked haddock risotto, the hake, the white wines they offer, and any of the desserts, really. It was spectacular. (Update from 2024: looks like it might be closed, thanks COVID).
Also, try the bakeries in Portree — and the little sandwich shops and savory pie places (anywhere, really, if you see a nice-looking pie).
EDINBURGH (EDI)
Italian:
1. For a very fancy night, you could try for a reservation at Locanda De Gusti (102 Dalry Rd). The food is top-notch homemade Italian; but it’s a small place so I’d guess that they are full already for the dates you’re there. Still worth a try!
2. For a very close second, make a reservation at a place Divino Enoteca (5 Merchant St). This place is large, so it almost always can fit you in for a same-night reservation, but it still has low, gorgeous lighting and punch-you-in-the-face, delicious food.
3. Finally, if you haven’t had a chance to try one of Jaimie Oliver’s restaurants elsewhere in the UK, it’s always a decent option. Jaimie’s Italian (54 George Street) is technically a chain, but it still serves pretty remarkable and creative Italian food. It’s a good lunch option if you’re staying nearby, but it's not worth trekking to.
Indian:
There is incredible Indian options all over Edinburgh, and I’m yet to try a bad one.. but these are the ones I’ve tried and would highly recommend. Regardless of whether you’re into spicy food or not, these places are a life experience:
1. Dishoom Edinburgh (3a St Andrew Square): This place started in London but has a few more now because of how perfect it is. Small plates, try-everything sort of style + delicious and seriously amazing cocktails. Matt and I decided to eat here twice in one week once, and I would have eaten there again. Tip — ask to eat downstairs if they will let you! The vibe of the bar seating is cooler (both metaphorically and literally) than the upstairs, which gets very hot in the summertime.
2. Tuk Tuk Indian Street Food: a hipster-style BYOB place that is quick, easy, and delicious.
3. Kamasutra Indo Tapas Restaurant (16 Drummond St) — this place is a little further out (and by further out, it’s like a 20 min. walk from George Street versus everything else), but that might turn out to be a good thing if other places are fully booked. It’s strikingly good and affordable too.
4. Ghurka Cafe (27 Cockburn St) is the first Indian place I discovered, so it has a very special place in my heart. I’ve taken every guest who visited me in Edi, and it was always a crowd pleaser. It’s a no frills kind of place (for instance, I think they only serve beer and average quality wine), but the flavors of the food are so good it will make you want to lick your plate clean (my not-so-new friend Mary’s son memorably did this). And it’s actually Nepalese so the dishes are really close to northern Indian dishes, very rich and pleasing. The location is super central and usually quite full, but somehow, they have always managed to fit me in without a reservation. (Still, make one if you can!)
Scottish:
1. Arcade Bar, Haggis & Whisky House (48 Cockburn St): This is a delicious lunch spot. For an easy entrance into the world of haggis, try the haggis nachos. If you are all-in, order the traditional style full plate haggis. Grab a dram of whisky here, too, if you’re feeling it — they have everything. The service is a little slow as they are often understaffed, but it’s such a pleasant atmosphere inside + perfect food that you won’t mind. :)
2. Fish n’ Chips: You’ll have plenty of opportunities for fresh fish n’ chips in the Highlands, so you might not want it in Edinburgh in lieu of other options, but if you do, my only advice is to get it from a small, low-key sort of place you notice somewhere that clearly gets fresh fish every day and not from a pub.
3. The Edinburgh Larder (15 Blackfriars St): simple but locally-sourced, delicious breakfast cafe/deli.
4. Oink (34 Victoria St): This place roasts an entire pig every day and makes these delicious (reasonably sized) sandwiches with various homemade toppings such as sweet potato mash, cranberry sauce, apple sauce, haggis, etc. It’s Matt’s favorite “snack” in Edinburgh.
5. Indigo Yard (7 Charlotte Ln): This place has delicious beers on tap and really impressive food. I guess it’s called a gastropub? The atmosphere is really nice — make a reservation if you can, and if you just show up, they might be able to squeeze you into the garden/bar area.
EDI Cocktails:
There is an underground cocktail place in Edinburgh called Panda & Sons — the outside looks like an old-style barber shop, but if the door’s not already open, just open it and go downstairs (Update: I later learned this is called a Speakeasy 😂) . I’ll let the rest be a surprise. It was recently rated in the top ten for good cocktails in Europe. Weekends can be really packed, but the cocktail will still be perfect every time, and the vibes are always great.
EDI Sweets:
Mary’s Milk Bar. I’m not big on sweets, and I initially thought I was just noticing this place because it has my name on it. But one day, I tried it, and now, I can confidently say it’s one of the few sweet places I would wait in line for — each flavor is a masterpiece! I saw only after I’d been that it made it onto Somebody Feed Phil’s Scotland episode. 💁‍♀️ (Thanks for recommending that show incidentally, sister Ellen!)
EDI Tourist spots:
1. The Castle: You can walk to see the entrance of the castle without paying the fee to get in ($18). It is worth it to go in if you have a free afternoon. It’s not a pop-in experience though. If you go, I would recommend touring half of it, taking a good long break in the cafe, and then touring the rest. There’s just so much to see; it’s all so remarkable; and it’s much more enjoyable at a leisurely pace.
2. Holyrood Palace: I’ve never been inside, but I have been told it is epic.
3. Royal Yacht Britannia: If you have an extra day, I would recommend this option highly. Especially if you are even vaguely swayed by the drama of the royal family (isn’t everyone when it gets right down to it?). If you’ve watched the Crown, book your tickets NOW. It is a big thing to get there if I remember correctly — I think we split a taxi?? — I don’t remember. But if you have the time, I definitely recommend it. If you’re days are limited, it’s not worth missing a day in EDI for though.
4. Calton Hill (at day or night) + graveyards + Arthur’s seat: This is my top recommendation for Edinburgh. Just put on some comfortable shoes and walk around Edinburgh.. follow windy stone streets.. especially the little alleys (which are called “closes”). Get lost. You’re allowed to follow any of the closes that catch your eye. Read about the history of closes if you’re interested. And if you think the history of closes is fascinating…
5. …take a guided tour of the famous, the real, Mary King’s Close. You’ll get the full history of the original design of the city and be able to see it underground, fully preserved from ancient times. (This is the only guided tour I’d recommend, but I’m not really that into guided tours.. I’m sure there are other great ones in Edinburgh, and probably even free ones with various themes.)
6. The Royal Mile: This could be absolutely packed with people in the summertime, so it may be hard to get perspective on the layout with the crowds, but it’s pretty remarkable to see nonetheless. Both amazing and average street performers congregate there, practicing for Fringe season, and there will be hundreds of free shows every day.
7. Live music will be abundant.
8. Grassmarket is a good neighborhood as well for seeing street performers and will be slightly less crowded than the touristy spots of EDI. I also like the Queen Street Gardens neighborhood. The museums close to Queen Street Gardens are both free and have a very impressive art collection.
9. Fringe: If you’re going in August, you will run into the chaos that is the Fringe Festival. Most people from EDI leave for the festival but if you brave it, but you should definitely get ahold of a Fringe magazine when you arrive, even just to see the enormity of the event. I find it pretty overwhelming, actually and ended up just choosing a few highly recommended shows — such as some of the acrobatic ones, comedy shows, burlesque, etc. and then leaving the rest of my time open for walking in and out of free shows. Basically, every single venue in Edinburgh will have a show of some sort. It’s fun for a day or two, but like Vegas, the feeling of awe wears off almost as quickly as it comes.
In general, I’d recommend visiting EDI literally any month besides August.
EDI Lodging:
I would suggest booking a place in EDI in advance — just to be sure you get to stay in a comfortable spot in the center.
My favorite place to stay is actually a hostel called Kickass Hostel. If you’re there with 2–3 people, ask to book a private room with a view of the castle. It’s really amazing — especially if you don’t mind a basic room and shared bathrooms (Update: I’m kind of past the point of sharing bathrooms). But either way, they have a comfy cafe where you can hang out and plan your EDI day.
Or not. Because plans, like the land, are made to be trespassed through in Scotland.

Edinburgh’s decline into a theme park has been charted for years, and the recent victory to Save the People’s Story stands out as an exception against a backdrop of relentless social cleansing, homelessness (the Scottish capital is home to the largest number of people living in temporary accommodation) and culture-washing.
The city’s problems are structural — it is a city of capital rather than a capital city. It’s purpose is hard-wired into its streets and architecture. As William McIlvanney writes in his novel Strange Loyalties, Edinburgh was:
“…built to be a Hanoverian clearing-house of the Scottish identity. The very street names declare what’s happening, like an announcement of government policy in stone: you have Princes Street and George Street and Queen Street with, in among them, Hanover Street and Rose Street and Thistle Street. Any way you count it, the result is the defeat of Scottishness. This was an identity superimposed on the capital of Scotland, an attempted psyche-transplant: ‘Scottishness may have been a life but Britishness can be a career.’
But if Edinburgh’s problems are historic, and symbolic, it is not helped by its current leadership. We know that Cammy Day was forced to resign from his job as leader of the Labour administration in the capital following allegations he had bombarded two Ukrainian refugees with multiple messages on social media. The councillor, who was suspended by his party last weekend, faces a police investigation into claims he acted “inappropriately”.

It is Friday, the beginning of May, my usual morning to write my blog and I’m sitting in a hotel room in Edinburgh, Scotland. The sky is blue and cloudless and the air is a crispy 47°F.
My usual routine back home is placing my computer on the dining room table, quieting my mind and giving thanks while my Doodle Abbey rests at my feet. Today, I sit on a comfy bed with pen and paper. I asked for divine guidance and inspiration.
In response, I hear, “ You are beautiful.”
One of my favorite songs is “ Beautiful” by Gordon Lightfoot, a tune and lyrics that touch my heart. “You are so beautiful. I was made for you and you were made for me.”
Imagine God/Source/our Creator saying to you, my brother Bob, Marilyn, Ann, Alena, Paulette, Michael….all of us “You are beautiful.” Tears fill my eyes and joy fills my heart. Hear the words…. “ I was made for you and you were made for me.”
We are all the same energy made for each other, across continents across lifetimes and realities.
Hold that, feel it. Don’t let anything else in. You, your essence, your light, you, you are beautiful.
How does it feel to walk through your days as “ I am beautiful” versus “I am human, I am flawed, I have issues, blah, blah, blah.”
Try it, now, today, all day, all month. For the month of May, tell yourself I am beautiful.
Look for beauty, everywhere, every day in this month of May and write it down.
“Through rain or shine for such a long time. I’m telling you, you are beautiful.”
You’ve been beautiful since the day you were born and before.
It would mean so much to me if you would experience this. If you would close your eyes, take a deep breath, listen carefully and feel the powerful love given to you by three words “You are beautiful .”
With a smile on my face and joy in my heart, I am off to explore Edinburgh. Enjoy your Friday. Happy May!!

One of the most striking features of Edinburgh is its weather, especially during the autumn and rain season. The misty rain often adds a sense of mystery to the old town, enhancing its fantasy-like appeal. Autumn in Edinburgh brings a palette of rich golds, browns, and reds, with the crisp air carrying the scent of fallen leaves and wet earth. The city’s vintage buildings…

Update: the Principal Edinburgh Charlotte Square hotel is now the Kimpton Charlotte Square. Read the new review here.
With a castle view, a garden room indoors, and a gentleman’s travel collection on display, The Principal Edinburgh Charlotte Square is simply the most remarkable place to stay in New Town.
I blew into the hotel on a gusty early evening unprepared to be immediately charmed by this hotel. But charmed I was. The outside is grand while staying coyly understated. The Principal inhabits seven gorgeous Georgian townhouses and has been fastidiously refurbished with both expected and unexpected details.
Although I loved the masculine entry hall, I was distracted by the restaurant during check-in. Previously an outdoor courtyard, it is now an indoor garden room with a glass ceiling reminiscent of an atrium, draped in hanging ferns and styled with garden furniture. My husband and I enjoyed a full breakfast here both mornings of our stay and noticed happy chatting groups when we came in late in the evening. Another restaurant with a completely different vibe is tucked away at one end of the hotel. BABA serves food with an Eastern Mediterranean flair sprinkled with local staples, such as Scottish beef. At a contrast to The Garden, BABA is dipped in deep greens, reclaimed wood and wool rugs. Its moody evening feel is exciting, even before you see a menu.
Our tour of the room included a story — how Scottish! If The Principal was a person, he’d be Hamish, a gentleman with fine tastes who travels the world looking for the best of it. He’s collected books, textiles and trinkets which he displays on shelves for the pleasure of his guests. Just like the front desk staff, I picture Hamish as friendly and warm — as welcoming as this hotel.
As this was my first time staying at The Principal family of hotels, I was delighted with the complimentary sweets and savory snacks in the tuck box. The red corded telephone by the bedside was adorable as well, adding to the eclectic mix of old and new that works so flawlessly here. I was delighted to see that books are available to borrow from the front desk and hot tea is as easy to find as whisky. Some rooms have the best view in the country, a view of Edinburgh Castle. Even knowing this before I arrived, it was still breathtaking.
If you only have one day in this beguiling city, do these three things within walking distance of the hotel:
1. Visit the most besieged fortress in Great Britain, Edinburgh Castle. Try the Millionaire Shortbread in the café.
2. Tour the homes (now underground) of the average citizen during the time of the plague. I recommend The Real Mary King’s Close Underground Tour.
3. Eat at The Elephant House to absorb the ambience of the place where J.K. Rowling wrote much of the first Harry Potter book.
There’s only one place to stay in Edinburgh with such abundant charms and comforts, The Principal Edinburgh Charlotte Square. My thanks to Simon Willis and Tara D’Agostino for their kind assistance with this story.

Liberal Arts Blog — Sunday is the Joy of Humor, Food, Travel, Practical Life Tips, and Miscellaneous Day
Today’s Topic: Scotland (Part One) A Little Geography, Five Battles, Edinburgh (including the Castle and the Fringe)
Last time, the fourth and final part of a series on the counties of Ireland. Today, on to Scotland, but first a re-cap.
On 2/23 we covered the Dublin of James Joyce and Leopold Bloom, Trinity College, the Ha’penny, Samuel Beckett, and O’Connell bridges, and St. Stephen’s Green, On 2/16 we investigated Northern Ireland including Belfast, the “Peace Walls,” the “Giant’s Causway” and Finn McCool. On 2/9, the central west (Galway, Mayo, Sligo) featuring the Aran jumper, Boycott, and Yeats. On 2/2 the southwest (Cork, Kerry, and Clare) and the stories of Daniel O’Connell (the emancipator of Catholics) and Michael Collins (independence leader who fought in the Easter Rebellion and was assassinated in an ambush at age 31 in 1922).
Now — the land of lochs and firths, of highlands, lowlands, and uplands, of the Shetlands, the Orkneys, and the inner and outer Hebrides, of Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen, of Robert Burns, William
Wallace, James Watt, James Clark Maxwell, Adam Smith, and Andrew Carnegie. And of the great clans — the MacKenzies, the Campbells, the Macleods, Stewarts, Douglases, Sinclairs, Macleans , Wallaces, MacGregors, Fergusons, and Gordons.
Are you Scottish? Have you been? Have you studied or lived there? What do you know about the northern third of island of Great Britain that the rest of us might not but would delight to learn?
Experts — please chime in. Correct, elaborate, elucidate.
GEOGRAPHY AND DEMOGRAPHY — note that firths are coastal inlets (like fjords) and lochs are lakes as in the famous story of the Loch Ness monster and the love song “Loch Lomond”
1. Scotland accounts for roughly a third of the island of Great Britain but has a population of only 5.5 million or about 8% of the United Kingdom. England: 56 million, Wales 3.2 million, Northern Ireland 1.9 million.
2. The border with England is only 92 miles long — as compared to its coastline of 6160 miles.
3. The North Channel separating Scotland from Northern Ireland is only 13 miles wide between the Mull of Kintyre in Scotland and Torr Head in Northern Ireland.
NB: 80% of Scotlands population is in the central lowlands which includes Glasgow (1 million) Edinburgh (half a million), Dunferline, Stirling, Perth, and Dundee.
FIVE HISTORIC BATTLES — Stirling Bridge (1297) Bannockburn (1314), Falkirk (1298), Folloden (1513), Culloden (1746)
1. Stirling Bridge (1297) William Wallace (1270–1305) and Andrew Moray (1265–1297) defeat English. Moray died of wounds from the battle. Wallace was later hanged, drawn, and quartered. Mel Gibson played Wallace in the film “Braveheart” (1995)
2. Bannockburn (1314) Robert Bruce defeats English leading ultimately to Scottish independence in 1328.
3. English victories against the Scots included: Falkirk (1298) Folloden (1513), and Culloden (1746).
The last English monarch to be killed in battle was James IV at the battle of Folloden. The Battle of Culloden ended the Jacobite rebellion which attempted to restore the Stuart monarchy. It was the last pitched battle on British land and resulted in mass evictions from ancestral lands, the banning of the tartan, and the disarming of the people.
EDINBURGH — THE CITY WITH A VOLCANIC PLUG IN THE MIDDLE UPON WHICH STANDS A CASTLE AND LEADING UP TO IT “THE ROYAL MILE” THROUGH THE “OLD TOWN” — have you been to the Edinburgh Fringe?
1. Edinburgh is bounded to the north side by the Firth of Forth and to the south side by the Pentland Hills.
2. “Recognized as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is the seat of the Scottish Government, the Scottish Parliament, the highest courts in Scotland, and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official residence of the monarch in Scotland.”
3. “The city has long been a centre of education, particularly in the fields of medicine, Scottish law, literature, philosophy, the sciences and engineering. The University of Edinburgh, founded in 1582 and now one of three in the city, is considered one of the best research institutions in the world. The financial center of Scotland, Edinburgh is the second-largest financial centre in the United Kingdom, the fourth largest in Europe, and the thirteenth largest internationally.”
NB: The Edinburgh Fringe is the “world’s largest performance arts festival which in 2024 spanned 25 days, sold more than 2.6 million tickets and featured more than 51, 446 scheduled performances of 3,746 different shows across 262 venues from 60 different countries. Of those shows, the largest section was comedy, representing 40% of shows, followed by theater, which was 26.6% of shows.” (see below)

Many years ago, I became the proud supervisor of not one, not two, but THREE PhD students and a part-time research assistant. Hurray me — I had a lab!
Now, clearly the word “lab” conjures images of test tubes and centrifuges, pipettes and petri dishes. Our research group has none of these things. But over time, the group of people associated with a given principal investigator (like me) and their shared resources (in our case, bubble guns and laptops rather than beakers and lab coats) has come to be known as a lab in a lot of scientific disciplines.
For us, the concept of the lab means a group of people who take an interest in each other’s work, help each other out when we’re stuck, and share ideas, resources and office space. We have a Code of Conduct to help set clear expectations for members of the group, and meet monthly to swap our latest news. Twice a year we have a half-day away day, sometimes focused on professional development and sometimes on just hanging out and having fun. Last autumn we had a session on writing a thesis and preparing for viva, but the most recent one included a foraging walk and then board games in a cafe!
My first challenge when deciding that my little team qualified as a lab group, was to come up with a name. I went to the pub with my husband and wrote down a series of keywords that described the work we were doing, and then saw which of these could be combined into a satisfactory and pronounceable acronym. And lo! DART was born — standing for development, autism, research, technology. Of course, I could have gone down the well-trodden path of the “Fletcher-Watson Lab” but honestly… *shudders*
Fast forward almost a decade and DART no longer seems like a suitable name for our little gang. “Research” has always bothered me as a keyword — I mean, obviously, we are researchers. “Autism” feels too narrow for what we do nowadays, which has a much broader focus on developmental diversity and trying to do work which is relevant and useful for multiple diagnosed and undiagnosed people. And it’s been a few years since I last did a project I could call “technology”.
So back to the drawing board, but roughly the same technique… Collectively we suggested words and — in a stroke of luck — this time we managed to organise them into an acronym that works for our largely-psychological research: MIND for mental health, interaction, neurodiversity, development. MIND though — there’s an awful lot of organisations out there with MIND as a name. That didn’t seem a good idea on its own, so Edinburgh MIND then?? Or maybe, there’s a chance to be clever and insert one more keyword into it all…
And so, the Edinburgh Inclusive MIND lab it is, or EdInMIND for short.
Nowadays this group has a rolling cast of about 10–16 members, as grant funding waxes and wanes. It is co-led by me and my close colleague, Catherine Crompton. While Catherine and I are both part of the Salvesen Mindroom Research Centre, our lab group is diverse and spans multiple parts of the University of Edinburgh — members may have a primary affiliation in the Division of Psychiatry, School of Philosophy Psychology and Language Sciences, Child Life and Health, Centre for Reproductive Health or Moray House School of Education and Sport. This diversity of perspective is one reason why we feel it’s important to have a lab identity which reflects our shared focus.
If you want to find out more about what we’re up to, the best gateway will be on this page where we link out to more specific projects and information — and back here, if you fancy going in a circle!

When I stepped foot in Edinburgh a few decades ago, I immediately fell in love with the place. That first sight of the city will never leave me, and I still adore how it holds its head high. Along with being beautiful, it is a highly educated and cultured city and has more graduates as a percentage than virtually any other place on the planet. It also hosts world-class innovation and research. While its infrastructure is never at a scale that the mighty London can achieve in terms of innovation, it is livable, walkable, and a fairly safe place to live.
In the city, I feel the ghosts of the past and of the great scientists, academics, business leaders and engineers who helped build the city and the country. This city, a few hundred years ago, showed the world how to take an enlightened approach to science and knowledge creation. In my university, too, I get to walk through John Napier’s Tower, and have the chance to convert his logarithms into something that provides the core of the security of the Internet — discrete logarithms.
And, for my PhD, I studied the work of James Clerk-Maxwell, and who’s created a unified theory for electromagnetic waves.
And, so, today, I am honoured to be elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE) [here], and share a space with those who have truly advanced Scotland as a country. As you should possibly know, Scotland has a long track record for punching above its weight in terms of invention and enterprise. Current fellows include many great scientists and engineers who have made Scotland their home, such as Peter Higgs and Jocelyn Bell Burnell. Former fellows include James Clerk-Maxwell and James Watt, along with the inventor of the TV:
And I love the entry for Benjmin Franklin, ad who is “interested in Electricity”:
But, for me, the mightiest of all, and possibly one of the greatest scientists of all time is James-Clerk Maxwell:
As you can see he was born in Edinburgh, and studied at the Edinburgh Academy and at the University of Edinburgh. After he graduated, he became a Professor at Aberdeen University, and then onto Kings College and Cambridge.
Education has given me everything in my career. For those starting out in their career, my core advice is to advance your education as much as you can, and achieve your full potential. No matter your background, if you have a desire to succeed, you will in the end. In fact, never stop learning, and advance yourself every single day. And don’t just learn from a superficial point-of-view; dive in and learn things deeply. If you can, read up on the classic research paper that built your field and understand the current barriers that need to be broken down. Research is great fun and can have a great impact … so go make a dent in this world (Steve Jobs quote). So, go do that MSc or PhD that you have always wanted to do.
This city and this country have given me everything that I would ever want in my career. They have helped shape our research and teaching, and they have been there to support us in building up collaborations, in supporting partnerships, and in allowing us the space to grow. To share a space that James-Clerk Maxwell once occupied is a privilege I will never forget. I am so lucky, too, as I get to research and teach the subjects that I love (cryptography and cybersecurity) and teach students who will build our future.

An Edinburgh Christmas Ghost Story — tales from the graveyards of the Necropolis of the North,https://medium.com/@DuncanHynd/an-edinburgh-christmas-ghost-story-tales-from-the-graveyards-of-the-necropolis-of-the-north-61a8d7150fb6,"Sign up

Our dead are never dead to us until we have forgotten them — George Eliot.
In the dark corners of the burial grounds of early 19th Century Edinburgh, the Necropolis of the North as I like to call it, two entrepreneurial men met a rapidly rising demand for human bodies to be used for anatomical dissection. Using human remains for medical research was illegal in the UK and banned in much of Europe or extremely limited for what were largely religious reasons.
To that end and to practice their surgical skills and enhance their anatomical knowledge doctors were only allowed to dissect bodies of executed criminals, people deceased in prison and oddly, orphans or people who had died with no fixed abode. As medical schools became more common, the supply and demand for dead bodies exceeded a state of economic equilibrium and so people resorted to body snatching or when that resource dried up, murder — to keep the cold medical school mortuary shelves and marble slabs well stocked.
Step forward William Burke and William Hare!
At the time Edinburgh was the leading European city for anatomical research and so the aptly named ‘resurrection men’ robbed fresh graves of their homo sapiens contents until relatives decided to take matters into their own hands and essentially lock the grave and coffin shut using what were termed ‘mort-safes’ of which some fine examples still exist in the infamous Greyfriars Kirkyard and others. These enclosed the grave, tomb or mausoleum in heavy duty wrought iron bars and locks, that even todays gangs that run around London with battery powered angle grinders to steal expensive bikes would struggle to cut open. The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh is still famed the world over as a leading surgical training today but by physically locking up the dead within their individual burial chamber, the supply of corpses rapidly dried up.
Out of interest, Surgeons’ Hall in Edinburgh, is the headquarters of the aforementioned Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and houses the Surgeons’ Hall Museum with anatomical displays and surgical equipment which is well worth a visit when you’re in town. There is also a library and archive of the colleges work.
The present Surgeons’ Hall was designed by Edinburgh’s leading light architect William Henry Playfair and completed in 1832, and is a category A listed structure while Playfair will feature in my tales of Edinburgh graveyards shortly and so please don’t change channels just yet!
The museum is recognised as a collection of national significance by the Scottish Government and very popular with tourists and locals alike.
Measures to ensure graves were left undisturbed, such as the use of mort-safes (I did research deadlock and mortice lock for this piece but there is no evidence that the etymological beginning of these names are at all linked to the subject matter but they sound like they should be) only made the shortage of cadavers even worse and so the indigenous vagrant population quickly became lambs to the slaughter and all for a princely sum of around £7 which would be worth around £1,000 today and so not to be ‘sniffed’ at.
When the New Calton Burial Ground was built as an overspill and operational replacement to the Old Calton Burial Ground just half a mile to its east on Regent Road due to Waterloo Place being built, a special watchtower was built, specifically to stop people grave robbing, such was the commercial opportunity on offer!
The murders started after a tenant in one of Hare’s properties died suddenly and the pair sold the body to Dr Robert Knox who was a celebrated lecturer of anatomy and a zoologist, ethnologist and medical doctor in the city and who had established the above-mentioned museum of anatomy and pathology. Another lodger, suffering from a cold was killed for literally sniffing too much and putting off other potential tenants from renting rooms and so the murders continued with the tacit approval of Burkes wife and Hare’s partner and no doubt partly to support their increasingly extravagant and expensive lifestyle. They were caught when the body of Margaret Docherty was discovered who was suspected to have been suffocated but at that time, no one could prove this.
Hare was granted immunity from prosecution and so by way of the use of Kings evidence he provided the details of Docherty’s murder and confessed to all sixteen deaths colloquially known then as the West Port Murders while charges were laid against Burke and his wife for three of the deaths.
At trial Burke was found guilty of just one murder and sentenced to death. The case against his wife was found not proven. Burke was hanged shortly afterwards and his cadaver was dissected and his skeleton displayed at the anatomical museum of the Edinburgh Medical School.
Robert Knox was never charged with his connection to the murders despite public outcry but his reputation in Edinburgh was irreparably damaged and so in time the Royal College of Surgeons forced him to resign as the curator of their anatomical museum.
The Burke and Hare case hugely raised public awareness of the need for cadavers for medical research and contributed to the passing of the Anatomy Act of 1832 that gave surgeons and students legal access to bodies from workhouses, hospitals and prisons that were unclaimed 48 hours after death. It was also made possible for a person to donate a next of kin’s body for medical research. It was essentially ratified in response to public outrage at the illegal trade in corpses.
The Arthur’s Seat 17 small coffins discovery
Robert Louis Stevenson died in 1894 and is buried on Mount Vaea, its summit overlooking Apia, the capital of Samoa. Many years before he died, he composed his own epitaph — ‘Under the wide and starry sky, Dig the grave and let me lie. Glad did I live and gladly die, and I laid me down with a will’.
Stevenson, as we know was a world-renowned Scottish novelist and is best known for Treasure Island, The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Kidnapped among many other books, poems, essays and travel guides. The son of Thomas Stevenson and grandson of Robert, a family famed for building lighthouses and other civil engineering feats suggested that he acquired his love of writing from his mother’s side of the family, the Balfours. His alma mater was Edinburgh University and while his paternal family were reticent about him taking on a life as a wordsmith and not an engineer, the rest as they say is history aside from the equally ‘strange case’ of 17 tiny coffins.
In June 1836, a group of boys were rabbiting on Arthur’s Seat, when they came across a small cave on the North East side, its entry covered by a stone and inside they found 17 miniature wooden coffins along with some tiny, carved figures clothed in delicate but bespoke outfits. These are now on show at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.
It has been mooted many times that these coffins are in some way a memorial to the 16 victims of Burke and Hare and as Burke was hanged in 1829 that made 17 deaths and indeed 17 coffins, others suggest they’re linked to some form of witchcraft.
However, in 2014, the museum was sent a package containing another small coffin with a small body with an accompanying note containing a long quote from Robert Louis Stevenson’s work — The Body Snatchers, which was part inspired by the Burke and Hare murders. Spooky indeed!
Greyfriars Bobby and the ghostly kirkyard.
There is no doubt that the most ‘popular’ graveyard in the Auld Reekie is at Greyfriars Kirk and probably because of a certain pet dog and not a famous human being although being what some term ‘the most haunted place in Edinburgh’ does get the tourists flooding in and it’s all for free as our all the main galleries and museums in this great, but increasingly ‘Disneyfied’ city.
The existing church on the site was built in 1602, and people have been buried here before then, including James Hutton, who famously stated that ‘we find no vestige of a beginning — no prospect of an ending’ and was part of Edinburgh’s period of ‘Enlightenment’. He realised that the earth was far older than current religious beliefs of the time allowed for and spoke out about this despite having to defer to the status quo and John Porteous, who was the drill master of Edinburgh’s city guard. When an infamous smuggler was hung in 1736, people rioted and he was given an order to shoot over them but as things worsened, he asked the soldiers to fire on the mob, killing many. He was charged, imprisoned at the Tollbooth, captured by the angry throng and then lynched, ending up buried at Greyfriars a day later. You can read more about this in my blog that features ‘Heart of Midlothian’ by Walter Scott which features this historic event and local football team the Jam Tarts and also my boyhood heroes Spurs.
From Waverley to White Hart Lane:
https://medium.com/@DuncanHynd/from-waverley-to-white-hart-lane-d083327faa2b
Rumour has it that it could be the most haunted graveyard in the world and is named after a Franciscan Friary located on the site but no longer stands there and aside from the above famous people interred also contains the burial places of some grave robbers too.
One angry, even violent apparition that has been allegedly seen and heard by late night revellers, legend has it is a certain George MacKenzie who was a tormentor of a religious group of 17th-century Presbyterians. Apparently, his ghostly form was freed when a tramp broke into his tomb and he has been on the rampage ever since.
Another often mentioned Greyfriars spectre is that of Edinburgh surgeon James Borthwick who died in 1675 and who bizarrely by today’s standards was the initial teacher of anatomy in a special society of barbers and surgeons! I guess this makes sense as both used sharp instruments to either shave people or operate on them or both if they wanted them dead and likely where the name cut throat razor came from!
A member of the Scottish Parliament, Borthwick was responsible for the creation of the ‘Surgeon-Apothecary’ group in Edinburgh as he served his internship as what would be a modern day pharmacist initially and was then incorporated as a surgeon unusually without first having served a surgical apprenticeship but as the city had been gripped by the plague, membership levels where very low. His speciality was as an anatomy teacher to student surgeons when human dissection was a much needed but often dark art.
By way of an Edinburgh council remit in 1657, the Surgeon- Apothecary group were granted permission to work on patients as until then the surgeons and apothecaries had completely different areas of practice.
Borthwick died in 1676 and is buried in this infamous grave yard, his monument adorned with a life size, crazy, dancing skeleton carrying a scythe in the style of Father Time, a royal crown and the skull and cross bones, with an array of surgical devices displayed on the sides!
James Hutton the geologist mentioned above is buried in desecrated land that was once the ‘Covenantor’s Prison’ that held circa 1,200 prisoners in around 1679, people who were so called militant Presbyterians and believed in what was known as the National Covenant and whom George MacKenzie, representing the Crown but in his human form, persecuted. Some simply died in the grounds, some were executed for treason, some escaped, and some were freed after signing a bond of loyalty to the Crown and shipped via the Port O’Leith to the US.
If you like Harry Potter, Tom Riddell’s villainous monument is located here too.
The graveyard is famously, from a tourist’s perspective, forever associated with the legend of Greyfriars Bobby, a dog who guarded his dead owner’s grave for 14 years and who has a burial headstone at the entrance. There is a statue and water fountain of Bobby, whose brass nose is now very worn out at the corner of Edinburgh’s Candlemaker Row and George IV Bridge and ridiculously popular for selfies as shown above.
Depending on the narrative you believe, and there are quite a few the dog was either a Skye Terrier or a Dandie Dinmont, who died on 14 January 1872. The best-known variation is that Bobby belonged to John Gray, who worked for the Edinburgh City Police as a night-watchman, with Bobby his formal watch-dog. Gray, under other popular pseudonyms was a farmer, a gardener or other!
Lastly, the churchyard has claimed the burial of other historic figures such as Scottish architect William Adam, its first famous post humous occupant how famously designed Hopetoun House near Edinburgh and Duff House, very close to where I live out the spring and summer months in Banff on the Moray Firth to William Wright, who was a Scottish physician, botanist, infamously part of the slave trade and joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
The leading architect of Edinburgh’s iconic buildings and graves gave his named to a popular pub too!
William Henry Playfair who infamously has a Wetherspoons pub named after him on Piccardy Place by the Vue cinema complex as a posthumous badge of honour was both a leading designer of landmark buildings and largely big-statement and non-conformist tombs in the Auld Reekie, mainly found in the remarkable Dean Cemetery, located high above the Water of Leith and the tourist hotspot that is Dean Village.
Born in 1790, Playfair died in 1857 and is buried in the same grave yard where some of his best work can be seen such as his pink pyramid tomb that inters Lady Sophia Rutherford and her husband Andrew Rutherford who was, among other illustrious jobs, the Lord Advocate of Scotland. His wife, Sophia Stewart died in 1852 where after Playfair built one of the most amazing memorials I have ever seen. The photograph below shows this and is in a line of tombs aptly named The Lord’s Row! His own memorial and the one to Lord Jeffrey are also worth a visit too. Francis Jeffrey qualified as a lawyer and was one of the co-founders of the influential magazine, the Edinburgh Review. He was editor, then became a politician and also the Lord Advocate.
His links to Burke and Hare are tenuous at best but it was he that designed the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh building where the surgeon Robert Knox worked and where he purchased the bodies.
He also was the architect behind the National Gallery of Scotland, the Old College at the University of Edinburgh and the Royal Scottish Academy along with what was termed the east or third New Town and many other Edinburgh neoclassical land marks. The old, steep steps that lead from the top of the Mound, down to the National Gallery are called the ‘Playfair Steps’ in his honour.
Born in London, his father was also an architect and shortly after his death he was sent to Edinburgh to be educated by his uncle John Playfair, usefully a famous mathematician. His alma mater was the University of Edinburgh and after graduating he joined the team of celebrated architect William Stark and eventually joined the Freemasons.
William Playfair died in Edinburgh in 1857, and is also buried in the Lord’s Row on the western edge where he designed monuments for others as shown above.
Since his death and completed in 2004 ‘The Playfair Project’ joined by tunnel the two separate buildings making up the National Galleries and then most recently the southern building has undergone an amazing £38m transformation, with a huge new subterranean section built into the Mound and exiting onto Princes Street gardens with stunning views over Waverley and the old Nor Loch that showcases the very best of Scottish art, with Landseer’s Monarch of the Glen holding court in its new resting place on a huge wall at the end the new building.
While walking around Dean Cemetery recently, located high above Dean Village, sited on the banks of the Water of Leith, I came across the grave of Edinburgh artist John Bellany, noted for his almost impressionist or expressionist, stylised portrait paintings of Scottish icons such as Billy Connolly and Sean Connery, created in the early 90s. Connolly’s portrait called ‘The Entertainer’ is currently not on display but the one of Connery is still exhibited in the National Portrait Gallery today. Once you have seen a Bellany image, you will instantly always know when you see one again.
On the subject of Connolly and Connery, aside from being famous Scottish thespians and having portraits painted by Bellany, at a BAFTA ceremony in 1999, Billy was due to present Sean with a life time achievement award but couldn’t make the event and so over a live TV link from the US said to all the guests present and Connery and his wife ‘You’ve done awfully well for a man with a speech defect’ and ended ‘congratulations baldy, I wish I had your money!’. Praise indeed. Connery died in 2020 and the whole of Scotland will be in mourning when Connolly meets his maker and would pay good money to hear what he says to him.
Bellany was born in Port Seaton in Edinburgh and much of his work has the sea as a main theme which often diverges into his own psyche or human form. Other well-known images merge human and animal forms, often painted in an overtly menacing style, However, his portraits of well-known people such as Connolly, Connery and Ian Botham are the most recognisable for me especially with regards to the colour palette used. His painting style calmed down when he was diagnosed with cancer later in life and he died in 2013 aged 71. When in Edinburgh, it’s well worth looking out for his unique, contemporary works.
Sean Connery’s ashes were scattered in St Andrews.
Below are the two paintings in question and my own photographs from the Edinburgh galleries when they were on show and exhibited to the public.
Beware the Weeping Angels
The Seafield cemetery in Edinburgh, located beside the now defunct Restalrig Railway, a cycle trail and footpath between Leith and the long sandy beach at Portobello is well worth a walk around. Some of the memorials are seemingly straight out of a series of Dr Who.
For lifelong fans like me, the ‘Weeping Angels’ were really scary, ghost like alien creatures in the form of an angel who were introduced in 2007 and that if you blinked, the angel would be able to very rapidly move much closer to you and the end game being that if they can reach out and touch you then you’re sent back in time to a life of purgatory. They are unable to move while being watched by anyone living, including oddly themselves and are turned to stone when an eye is glanced upon them and so the angel below is quite a good representation, especially on a cold, dark day! When stone like, they cannot be harmed.
The then writer and creator Steven Moffat reckons that they are the most popular and frightening foe of the Doctor in that any stone statue could be one, but he would say that wouldn’t he. For me the Daleks and Cybermen will never be bettered but I am over sixty now!
They do really resemble female stone statues in the form of winged angels with draped robes that you might find in a Victorian graveyard like Seafield. However, as they move in closer to you they show off vampire like teeth and clawed fingers and in some episode they even had ‘babies’ that resembled demonic cherubs that laughed and made rather loud footsteps!
Weeping Angels can’t look at each other nor in a mirror and so shield their eyes to avoid paralysis, which is where they get their name from as it looks like they’re weeping but have the ability to send you back in time to an age when you didn’t exist or will ever exist. The resulting forces from this is their life blood.
There are many more nuances but we’ll leave that there!
The Scottish Enlightenment, in a very brief nutshell!
An amalgamation of free minds, ideas and publications was centred in particular in Edinburgh and also over Scotland generally during the second half of the 18th century and for decades prior to and after that. It was a movement of ideas and the debate of those ideas and in philosophy, the two men most prominent were David Hume and Adam Smith.
Edinburgh was then described as hotbed of genius while Voltaire wrote in 1762 rather contentiously that ‘today it is from Scotland that we get rules of taste in all the arts, from epic poetry to gardening’.
David Hume, a leading light in the movement was a philosopher, historian and economist who was best known for his influential beliefs in ‘empiricism, philosophical skepticism and metaphysical naturalism’ which is a view which holds that there is nothing but natural elements, principles, and relations of the type studied by the natural sciences and denies the existence of a transcendent God. Philosophical skepticism is an important form of scepticism in that it rejects knowledge claims that seem certain from the perspective of common sense.
Empiricism is the theory that all knowledge is based on experience derived from the senses and created by those who doubted the possibility of acquiring any knowledge beyond that of the contents of directly felt experience. He believed that ethics were based on emotion and sentiment rather than one’s moral compass.
His mantra that making lives better by finding differentiation between morality, religion, ethics, and society was critical to his ideas but hugely controversial for the time. Hume held that passions rather than reason rule the human psyche saying that ‘Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions’.
His philosophy of religion, as with Hutton’s view on Geology included a rejection of miracles and the existence of a creator God, were especially controversial for their time and where being outspoken on such issues was sometimes dangerous and considered blasphemous, something we need to be careful not to repeat today.
His most famous line was that: ‘The life of man is of no greater importance to the universe than that of an oyster’.
Adam Smith was a social philosopher and a political economist while David Hume and Smith were very close friends.
Smith famously said that ‘Labour was the first price, the original purchase-money that was paid for all things. It was not by gold or by silver, but by labour, that all wealth of the world was originally purchased.’
He believed that wealth is created by hard work and self-interest. Smith’s suggestions that economies that are based on free markets, competition and capitalism are still the bedrock of economics and growth today.
As the self-styled father of economics, he wrote the book ‘Wealth of Nations’ and also suggested that ‘Goods can serve many other purposes besides purchasing money, but money can serve no other purpose besides purchasing goods. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from regard to their own interest’.
Hume died in 1776 and Smith in 1790
Hume is interred at the Old Calton Hill burial ground, just off Waterloo Place in a round, tower like tomb as shown above with a locked gate to keep out the grave robbers while Smith’s body lies in the Canongate Kirkyard close to Holyrood and he has a statue on the Royal Mile.
And finally, Sir Henry Raeburn Scotland’s finest painter…arguably
Raeburn was born Stockbridge, just north of the city centre of Edinburgh and is depending whom you talk to is arguably the best known of all Scottish painters and is buried in St Cuthbert’s churchyard, located at the west end of Princes Street and across the road from the Caledonian Hotel. His formal portraits are instantly recognisable, with legends such as Sir Walter Scott, part of his prolific portfolio, just pay a visit to the National Portrait Gallery on Queen Street to find out!
He actually commissioned and installed his monument and grave at St Cuthbert’s well before he died in 1823, hence including him in my story.
However, perhaps the most famous painting accredited to him and I say that advisedly, may well not be by him at all and is not really a recognised portrait either.
The Reverend Dr Robert Walker skating on Duddingston Loch or colloquially known as ‘The Skating Minister’ was acquired by the National Galleries of Scotland in 1949 for a song and is one of their most popular paintings both to view and as part of its merchandise offering and so they are not going to give up on its provenance despite many believing that Henri-Pierre Danloux, a French immigrant who was based in Scotland at the time, was the painter. Some say that Raeburn simply painted the face and not the majestic motions of the holy man on the ice.
In Michelle Sloan’s great book ‘The Edinburgh Skating Club’ she takes a ‘novel’ approach to the painting’s narrative where her main character Alison Cockburn, who was employed and friends with the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume whom we’ve met above, colludes with his sister, Katherine Hume to live as a man so as to become a member of the prestigious and men only club.
In a coincidental nod to the toxicity of gender reform politics in Scotland these days whereby it was stated that you could self-certify as a woman after a few months of simply deciding to be one, this makes for a remarkably contemporary novel but one full of local historic Edinburgh landmarks, characters and times past.
The background story is set in modern times and catalogues an art historian’s efforts to attribute the work to Danloux and ‘out’ the outlandish fact that Rev Walker might just have been a woman about to win a very big, life changing bet! It’s a great read and a good whodunnit.
Raeburn at the age of 28 moved to London where he met and was hugely inspired by portraitist Joshua Reynolds returning to Edinburgh in 1787 where he started to paint portraits of the Auld Reekie’s rich and famous and was hugely sought after and successful despite being largely self-taught.
He was knighted in 1822 just a year before he died and shortly thereafter was appointed His Majesty’s Limner for Scotland. A limner is an illuminator of manuscripts, or more generally, a painter of ornamental decoration.
Raeburn was especially well known in Scotland as the outstanding portrait painter of members of the Scottish Enlightenment and probably painted in excess of 225 acknowledged pieces.
When the Leith based shipping business, Henry Raeburn and Company, collapsed at the end of 1807, he was declared bankrupt and was left to paint portraits and act as a property developer to pay off creditors for the rest of his life.
His painting of Walter Scott in 1822 was one of Raeburn’s undoubted highlights, someone who also was left bankrupt by a series of poor business decisions and overspending. Later in life he chased warmer weather in Italy by way of a lift on a UK naval frigate but suffered a stroke on his way home, he died in 1832 at Abbotsford, where he is buried. The portrait shows Scott deep in thought at the height of his writing career.
Raeburn’s self-portrait was designed to project himself as the premier painter in the land especially to his peers down in London and painted this as his diploma picture for entry into London’s Royal Academy. He painted in York Place in a New Town house that had large north facing windows and special shutters to create the ultimate conditions for is work. He never made it back to London to paint and died in 1823 and is buried in his chosen resting place at St Cuthbert’s kirkyard at the very west end of Princes Street gardens.
I ain’t afraid of no ghosts — The Ghostbusters song
For me, I’m a great proponent of the new assisted dying law and hope that it becomes part of the statute soon, just as a back stop for those so ill, they can’t bear it any longer. I’ll have a ‘pure cremation’, whereby without any fuss, they take me away in a black bin bag, return me in an urn and I get chucked out into the Moray Firth!
If it was mandatory to have an epitaph I would go for Clement Freud’s idea when he said before he died…it will simply bear my name, and then the date of my death beneath the words ‘best before’.
I don’t believe in ghosts but I wouldn’t want to spend a night alone in Greyfriars, it is a cold, dark and scary place but if graveyards are your thing, the Necropolis of the North or the Auld Reekie is well worth a visit.
I prefer the Cullen Pet cemetery near my home in Moray where I find the messages of love for lost pets far more moving and relevant to me, however in the past stupid EU rules closed it down, but after Brexit, people can once again bury pets themselves and say whatever they like about them.
Go see!

Or what the world’s biggest arts festival taught Leith planner, Claire Wood, about how to be better at her job.
Every August, Edinburgh hosts the biggest arts festival in the world. This year’s Fringe boasted over 55,000 performances of over 3,500 shows. Interestingly, it featured more shows about ‘social issues’ than previous years.
As someone who works for an ad agency and so spends a good portion of her time thinking about social issues and how advertising can persuade people to change harmful habits, I was curious to explore whether you can do the same with theatre. After all, the shortest show I saw this year lasted less than eight minutes. And even eight minutes gives you a better crack at encouraging people to change than a 30 second ad.
Of course, the context is different. Usually (though the Royal Mile in the Fringe is an exception), you actively choose a piece of theatre where you might bump into advertising content. And you usually plump for a particular production because some aspect of it appeals — the creative team, the topic, the actors. Few people actively seek out advertising as a reflection of their world view. (Is last week’s Nike campaign an honourable exception? Discuss.)
But assuming both do their jobs right, whether advertiser or theatre maker, both are creating content that they hope their audience will want to discover. So can we learn anything from theatre makers about how best to persuade people to change their ways? I think so — as follows:
Sometimes, the reasons you might want to behave differently are obvious. Most people now accept that it’s good to wear seatbelts when you’re driving and it’s bad to smoke, for example. But often, in order to persuade people to consider change — or disrupting a pattern — it helps if they understand the context, or the reasons why change is good.
Closed Doors was a quick-witted feisty piece of theatre by Glasgow performance poet, Belle Jones in collaboration with Novasound. Following a Police evacuation of a Glasgow tenement, three women from very different backgrounds are forced to confront the assumptions they’ve made about each other. Topical in these times of terrorist threats, firebombs and foiled plots, Jones’ message — that we should judge less and talk to each other more — is beautifully delivered.
From one woman’s story to another. Earlier this year, the Scottish Government passed a bill that recognised that domestic abuse isn’t only physical; it can also be psychological. ‘Coercive control’ will soon be easier to prosecute though the law will rely on victims coming forward to seek help.
Never Vera Blue was a devastating study of a woman trapped in an abusive relationship. Developed in partnership with the Gaia Centre in Lambeth, the peculiar ways in which coercive control can be exercised were thoroughly explored and the protagonist found a way out. Easy to say but not so easy to do.
By showing an understanding of the peculiar individual misery of an abusive relationship — and then dramatising an escape, Futures Theatre hope to both raise awareness of the problem, of how insidious and invidious coercive control can be and to inspire more people to take action.
2. Showing can help — but sometimes you have to tell
The Half Moon Shania briefly touched on a topic close to our client Drinkaware’s heart: sexual harassment in the night time economy. The musical explored a female punk band’s attempts to hit the big time in an industry all too ready to take advantage of wannabes. Burnt Lemon Theatre had ample opportunity (and didn’t really take it) to land a message about how you could behave if you see someone being harassed on a night out — but then they were making a piece of theatre, not a self-help manual.
At the other end of the spectrum were a bunch of shows that had a very explicit call to action. Part of Death on the Fringe, both User Not Found and Sit With Us For A Moment And Remember took on the tricky topic of grief. At Dante Or Die’s User Not Found, the audience listened to most of the play through headphones but were asked to take them off for the final scene —emphasising the importance of human contact. And I don’t want to ruin the climactic moment of Lincoln Company’s Sit With Us… to be found on a park bench overlooking Edinburgh’s extinct volcano but it was a beautiful reminder of the importance of being there for people.
Both, by building empathy — or at least intrigue in the case of Sit With Us — left a more lingering impression than a poster might.
3. Advocacy is as much as we can hope for
Beyond actually getting people to do the thing you hope they’ll do (CPR! Joining the organ donor register!), urging them to talk about it with friends and family can also be helpful to raise awareness and start to shift attitudes. With organ donation, it’s vital as consent is everything.
Leo Burtin’s The Midnight Soup is intended to do exactly that. As well as having one of the Fringe’s smartest marketing strategies — a ticket for his show also includes your dinner.
Under the auspices of talking about his grandmother’s unexplained suicide, Burtin invites a small audience to help him make soup. As we chop, he tells us about his gran, using her sudden death as a prompt for his audience to discuss their own attitudes towards and preparations for their own end of life care.
The experience of preparing food together, Burtin explained afterwards, helps break down a typically British awkwardness and encourages conversation. The Fringe was a temporary stop off. He’s more usually found taking the show to community centres and care homes — his soup cooker is portable!
Interesting for us advertisers as our field and experiential activity is usually intended to do something similar. We often rely on visual eye candy to attract people to the stand — and then field staff to convey our message. Maybe we need to be thinking harder about how we involve our audiences in the debate.
4. Empathy is everything
Whether we’re trying to persuade people to do an icky bowel cancer test or to drink a little bit less alcohol, we need to show that we understand our audience. Telling without sympathy and / or empathy is only lecturing. And who ever has responded well to that?
And maybe that’s where theatre has the advantage. You’ve bought a ticket for a show — and thereby given permission to whoever it is to talk at you for the next fifty minutes. Where we’re trying to persuade people to take time out of their to do lists and pay attention to us for a frantic thirty second slot. Poor us.
But we could also learn that with enough energy, creativity and vitally, ability to listen, it’s easy (easier, anyway) to empathise with your audience. I’ll Have What She’s Having was a cracking insight into what it is to be young, female, trying your best to have it all but buckling under the pressures of needing to be seen to have a perfect life on social media. Grassmarket Projects’ Where It Hurts looked at the NHS in its seventieth year. A homage to its collective grace and tenacity and a yowl of frustration at escalating demand, it reminded us that lots of health issues can’t be set in plaster and left to heal.
Aside from being a stunning show — I’m eternally grateful to David Amers for telling me at least three times that it was the best thing he’d seen this Fringe — Electrolyte by Wildcard was a stunning study of mental ill-health and the power of friends to help you through. You can read all the books you like about the disorientation, discombobulation, isolation and fear that goes with mental health problems but this young company turned all of that into an hour and ten minutes of gripping, glorious story-telling. Wildcard deliberately set out to give the “unknown and disenfranchised” a voice, thereby empowering them to take action. And Electrolyte does just that, with literal bells on.
And maybe that’s why the Edinburgh Fringe is a little bit like crack cocaine for me. Three weeks, 3,500 shows in a city that’s barely built to cope and every time you step off the street into another dim cavern, you’re bumping up against someone else’s little slice of life in all its unapologetic, fierce, feisty glory. Stories worm their way into your mind and your heart in a way that a textbook will always struggle to do. It might make for an empathy overload. But it’s also a greedy planner’s dream.

When arriving in Edinburgh, Scotland, I had little to no expectations for this trip. With finals being so close to leaving, I didn’t feel I had the time to research these places. I thought the city was beautiful, as I’ve never seen anything like it before. The architecture was amazing, I have never seen so many Gothic buildings. My time here left me with so many beautiful photos. Something I didn’t expect to see here though, was little to no local people! I had no clue that most people who live here are not from the area.
After experiencing the beautiful city of Edinburgh, Scotland, I fully expected Dublin, Ireland, to be very similar. Instead, Dublin was so vivid when I arrived, the city felt more alive than Edinburgh. When comparing them, I would say Edinburgh is like a small tourist town. While Dublin has the tourist town feeling with all of the gift shops, there is so much more to it! I noticed just walking the streets of Dublin I saw so many restaurants and shops I wanted to go back to. The area we went to in Scotland felt almost too geared towards tourists, as a majority of the stores there had the exact same items.
In Dublin, I saw more attractions, retail stores, and restaurants in between…

Last week I was trundling down Leith Walk’s infamous cycle lane and realised that I was having a deeply unpleasant time.
It’s wasn’t the ongoing threat of HGV drivers mounting the kerb, or drivers blasting through STOP signs at the junctions, or having to swerve around the pedestrians squeezed into the cycle lane by the preposterously narrow pavements.
No. It was the dreadful surface quality. Despite a warning from Spokes, the cycling advocacy group, the entirety of this critical active travel route has been hand laid, meaning that while drivers enjoy a beautifully smooth surface on the carriageway, cyclists have to put up with buckarooing their way down the Walk.
This was something worth quantifying, in the hope that the same mistake won’t be made again. Deploying the in-built accelerometer on my phone, I set out to test the primary cycle corridors in the city. I used the busy North Meadow Walk (NMW) as my baseline; it has a good surface, with a few bumps and rough patches.
On NMW I recorded a low median figure— that is, the middle number in all the observations my phone made as I cycled along. I think this is the best way to measure the general condition of the surface as it is not as affected by the very large bumps that come with potholes and other aberrations.
The paths of the north Edinburgh path network, or NEPN, tend to be the smoothest in the city. The new city-centre-west-to-east-link (CCWEL) is also of good quality on this measure.
“Bumps” are how I describe the fluctuations in the surface that can make life miserable for cyclists. To capture the size and frequency of such bumps, I calculated the 95th percentile of recorded acceleration for each of my journeys in Edinburgh. That is, the value at which a particular bump will find itself in the top 5% of all bumps for that particular path.
The same sequence of paths appears, though this time CCWEL doesn’t perform quite as well.
These are the sort of thing that can throw you from the saddle, or knock your panniers off. The 0.999 quantile.
The most severe bumps are found on Leamington Walk, with the Innocent Railway Path also suffering from a particularly awful surface on this measure. CCWEL scores very well, while on-road cycle paths typically do worse.
I gave equal weighting to each of the three measures described above and found that the worst surface you can find in Edinburgh is on Leith Walk’s northbound cycle lane. No surprise.
This was followed by those on McDonald Road and the direct route between Kings Buildings and central campus of Edinburgh University. The worst paths tend to be those that encounter heavy vehicle traffic, or were constructed some time ago.
That makes the brand new cycle-only paths on Leith Walk, Picardy Place and outside Toppings particularly woeful.
I also cycled down the carriageway of Leith Walk and found that for all three of my measures, it’s significantly better than the adjacent cycle lanes.
The most severe bumps have been plotted on this interactive map.
I used a google pixel phone, quadlock phone mount and the Physics Toolbox app to measure acceleration as I cycled along, measuring linear acceleration and recording my position via GPS.
I used the square of acceleration in this analysis on the assumption that discomfort does not correlate 1:1 with acceleration.
My phone made roughly 50 observations per second; after data cleaning, I had nearly half a million observations to play with.
Caveat — my phone isn’t the best measurement tool in the world, and the statistics I have contrived aren’t perfect either. However, I assert that they will be consistent with the experience of most cyclists in Edinburgh.

I’ve been enjoying Simon Young and Chris Woodyard’s podcast Boggart and Banshee, which deals with all manner of fairy encounters, witchcraft, and supernatural accounts.
Their most recent episode covers the mysterious dolls found near Arthur’s Seat in Edinburgh in June 1836. Local boys found a crevice on the hill containing seventeen dolls, a series of male wooden figures about 3–4 inches, clothed in various fabrics and interred in tiny pine coffins. Based upon the amount of decomposition, the dolls had been placed relatively recently. Eight of these dolls have survived until today at the National Museum of Scotland, which has put together an informative page on these finds with all manner of videos and photos of the dolls.
Simon and Chris advance the view that these dolls are used in the practice of malefic magic. Based upon the different fabrics used, they believe that these dolls represent particular victims selected by a local cunning person, wrapped in pieces of stolen clothing and placed in coffins to cause death.
I’m somewhat up in the air on this. Certainly, there is a great deal of local variation and interpretations of many different magical techniques, so depositing images in this manner is not necessarily out of the realm of practice. Yet this does leave several questions open.
One of the most common magical experiments recorded in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was the creation of two wax images to recover goods lost through theft. Calling upon angels to assist, the magician was told to put the wax close enough to the fire to be heated… but not too close, lest it cause injury. This technique was still known in Britain in the 1850s, as it appears in the magical notebook of the Liverpool cunning man William Dawson Bellhouse. So our hypothetical Edinburgh cunning person is likely to have known for a much less involved method to cause death through image magic.
This is by no means definitive, of course — a magician might not have heard of this technique, or lacked access to wax for some reason, or wanted to cause a long lingering death (see below), or any number of other possibilities.
Another question is the method of deposition. The most likely place to deposit malefic magic directed against a person is on their property — either in secret, so as to work its sorcery through proximity as long as possible, or openly, as a warning to the person. There are other models, of course. Yet I have trouble understand why a cunning person would use a cavern atop a high hill near a major urban center, returning to the site seventeen times. Why not bury each coffin individually elsewhere, in the manner suggested here? Why risk discovery of the assemblage by repeated visits?
What would be an alternative explanation, then? I think previous examiners have missed the most obvious clue — and those of you who have been following my roleplaying accounts know what it is.
We have a set of entirely male figures — according to some, made to appear as soldiers — hidden in a cave on a major geographic feature named after King Arthur. Could it be that these dolls are a tribute in honor of the Once and Future King, who is often credited with resting with his knights in caverns across Britain until he comes forth again to save the land?
Admittedly, I’d feel better about this theory if there was a doll discovered that had a crown. But some of the dolls were destroyed, and given that they were in various degrees of decomposition, it’s likely any hypothetical “Arthur” doll would have been the first added and in the worst shape of all.
I’d be interested to hear what you think. Is this plausible? Am I missing something?

Today I’m going to take you on a walking tour through old Edinburgh. This piece was originally written as a script for an armchair audio tour. It incorporates stories about historical figures like Mary, Queen of Scots, the body snatchers Burke and Hare, William Wallace and Robert the Bruce as well as tales of ghosts and witches, and a sprinkling of architecture. It is intended to be read out loud and listened to on a rainy afternoon by a roaring fire with a glass of single malt whisky to hand. Slàinte mhath!
Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland, is my hometown. It regularly makes the top ten lists of best places to live in the world and best cities to visit. In summer, because Edinburgh is so far north, you can enjoy about 18 hours of daylight. The Old Town is a World Heritage Site and stretches along a ridge from Castle Rock down to the Palace of Holyroodhouse.
Edinburgh is built on seven hills which provide a dramatic backdrop to the city’s skyline. These hills include Arthur’s Seat, an ancient volcano that provides panoramic views of the city and beyond, and Calton Hill, home to some of Edinburgh’s most iconic monuments.
Now, close your eyes, and take a deep breath. The weather today is cool, with a breeze that carries the fresh salty air from the nearby North Sea. Feel the damp, misty air on your face. Exhale and relax.

There is this idea that if you know an area, a city, you can look up its main street and see years of history having already been made. The geography of it literally recalls history just in looking. There’s where this happened, here’s where that happened. . .
Take a look down Edinburgh Scotland’s Royal Mile, and you surely see down a millenium. Starting at the west end, there’s Edinburgh Castle, site of more than a few siege takings. In it was born a king, and in it one died, as well. The king born was King James of Scotland, son of Mary Queen of Scots. He was later asked to be the king of England as well. His mom had his dad killed, it is rumored, in the castle. At best, the whole thing was a shady ordeal. Mary, Queen of Scots was not born in it, but she ruled from it for a number of years.
Maybe you think of a queen as someone in her 40’s or 50’s, but no, Mary was a maiden of some 20 something years when she returned to Scotland from France to rule the people of Scotland. But she is another story.
Come out from the castle to the promenade where the Tattoo is held. This tattoo is a military celebration of sorts, held every year during the Edinburgh International Festival in August. At this tattoo several different military regiments from all over Scotland come to show off their skills, uniforms and Scottish pride for all the world to see, and it is quite a show. It is best to take in the later of the two evening events, as the fireworks are more spectacular later on. In August, it is broad daylight at 9:30 pm! So, the good watching is around 11:30.
The Royal Mile is not the official name of the street, it is more an honorary title given to it. This is actually more than a mile, from Edinburgh Castle to Holyrood Palace, at the east end. The Royal Mile actually has 4 street names given to it. The street numbering system has them running out of numbers in short order, so they just change the street name every few blocks, and that takes care of it. Two of those names were done away with, and one assigned to that portion.
Coming from the promenade is Johnston Terrace, which extends east to Bank Street. At this corner is a speakeasy known as Deacon Brodie’s Tavern. Deacon Brodie was a highly respected cabinetmaker; well at least during the day. At night, it was a different story. He was known to be a robber in the night hours. One time he was caught in the coffers of the national treasury. He escaped then and fled the country. He then wrote a note to someone he knew in Edinburgh, from what he thought was a secure location. Authorities were able to determine this so-called secure location, went after him, placed him under arrest, brought him back to Scotland, and hung him on gallows he had himself built for someone else. It was his double life that inspired the Robert Louis Stevenson epic novel, “Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde”.
At Bank Street, the mile becomes High Street, a name which stays with it for most of its length. Walk half a block east on High Street, cross the street, and you see one landmark, the Heart of the Lothian, built into the brickwork just a few feet out the door of St. Giles Cathedral. Scotland is divided into several regions, and Edinburgh is in the center of the Lothian Region. So, the Heart of the Lothian is dead center of this region. In much earlier days, there was a prison on this site.
As I said, this Heart of the Lothian is but a few feet away from the head worship center of the Church of Scotland, St. Giles Cathedral. The Presbyterian Church worldwide has its origins here. What we call the Presbyterian Church, in Europe, is called the Church of Scotland. Its most famous preacher and head was John Knox, a Scot himself, born in Gifford. Knox was himself a disciple of John Calvin of Germany, but when he took his own stand in Scotland it was at St. Giles, and he re-established the church there. Knox was in the pulpit while Mary was on the throne just up the street, and he was heard to speak of the need for dethroning for her deeds. To re-establish St. Giles as such took evicting some adherents of the Church of England. They left and started Old St. Paul’s Episcopal Church.
The Royal Mile runs downhill, west to east, and there are some cross streets, but to facilitate passage down the hill to the north, and indirect access to patrons on the Mile, stepped passageways called closes where built here and there between buildings. It is in these closes that other establishments were located. There are many closes up and down the Mile, and each has its own history.
Step out the east door of St. Giles, take but a few steps, and you arrive at a round structure with a gabled roof known as the Mercat Cross. This was an ancient assembly point for people of the town. They assembled there to hear governmental decrees, proclamations, and to witness public hangings.
One website describes it thus: “the old center of town- marketplace, news-stand, pulpit and gallows . . . it was a real one stop shop!”
The present Mercat Cross does not stand where the original did, but that location is marked by a cross laid into the sidewalk. It was the center of the old Edinburgh.
Going a block or so east on the mile, one arrives at Tron Kirk. Kirk is Scottish for church. (Talk about the US and the UK- two countries separated by a common language!) Now before Knox arrived at St. Giles, the Church of England had pretty well dispatched the Church of Scotland out of the place. They went a block east and built the Tron Kirk.
Actually, it was called “The Bishop’s War, where the king tried to introduce Episcopal structure into the Church of Scotland. He actually took over St. Giles and made it the seat of the Bishop of the Church of England.
So, the Church of Scotland people, refusing this intrusion, went and built the Tron Kirk. The building itself is no longer a church, but its physical structure remains as a visitor center.
Cross the street again, and head east from North Street, walking until you get to a large building called Carrubbers Christian Center. Carrubbers was founded back in the 19th Century in the Carrubbers Close, as a mission. Dwight L. Moody came and brought his chief musician Ira Sankey, and together they raised enough money to build this large 4 story evangelistic center. Originally built with a two-story worship center, the lower floor was converted to other uses in recent years. The center has been a beacon of hope to Edinburgh since its inception and remains so today. It has a library, a meeting hall, and dorm rooms on the top floor for university students as well as visiting clergy.
Go further east, on that side of the street, and the building that juts out and establishes a new position for the fronting buildings is the home of the preacher from the cathedral up the street, John Knox. Knox lived here during his years when he pastored at St. Giles Cathedral. His years pastoring St. Giles were also his last. He died in this house. I will warn you, though, that the people who marked his life with this museum were not terribly kind to his message of the Gospel or his dealings.
Going further down the street one more block, the Royal Mile changes its name to Canongate, a city gate from early days of the town. On Canon Gate, one walks the rest of the mile to Holyrood Palace, the annual accommodations for the Queen of England in June. The royal family also spends a month in the north of Scotland, at Balmoral Castle.
To look up the Royal Mile is to look up into history, and it always reminds you. A sea mist, called a haar, can roll in though, and you won’t see past a block, they are so thick. But you’ll never forget where you’ve been!

Last time I lived in Edinburgh it was 1993. I moved there with a bunch of friends after university. As you might expect from a group of people who’d spent more time in the pub than in the lecture theatre, none of us had managed to get a proper graduate job.
It was the middle of a recession so we figured we’d go hang out in Edinburgh, continue the party lifestyle, do some temp work and maybe even find a job to make our parents proud.
At that time no one had heard of She Who Must Not Be Named, although funnily enough 1993 was the year that she moved to Edinburgh. She’d already sketched the outline for the Harry Potter books but in 1993 J.K. Rowling began writing in cafes such as Nicolson’s (now Spoon) and no doubt was influenced by the city’s history and architecture.
Our Edinburgh at that time revolved around nights out at indie and alternative clubs like the Mission in Victoria Street, Evol or FBI in the Cowgate, various pubs in the Grassmarket and around the University, live music at the Preservation Hall or the Ensign Ewart and visits to the many art galleries and museums (all of which were free).
We’d walk all over the city and I truly loved it. But all good things come to an end, and…

Nobody cares about the fact I’m going to Edinburgh Fringe and neither should they. I’m a comedian going on a jolly for a couple of weeks in a great city with loads of my pals and trying to make people laugh. Yes it’ll probably bankrupt me and I’ve done everything in my power to not lose money hand over fist but even so, nobody is forcing me, it’s fucking great at it’s core (once we overthrow the Tories up there charging thousands for August rents). I could use this piece to get extremely angry about class and how it’s easy to do it if you’re secretly loaded, but we all know that, so allow me to drivel on for 800 words (681 from here on in, OK and that used up five, we’re nearly there) and hopefully encourage you to tweet the link to this piece with one of the following quotes above the link so people think I’ve made some sort of life-changing point;
My show is about…..WOMEN. Does that make you uncomfortable?! Probably not. You might even know one. It came from working in women’s media and being told every day what to be angry at, what to be turned on by, what to be repulsed by, who to be angry at and why you must always, every single day, be told how to ask for a pay rise. There’s an entire industry dedicated to books about work. Can you believe it? Titles like ‘How To Get What You Want At Work And Shag Your Colleague Respectfully’ and ‘How To Boss Bitch Your Way Into Millions Of Pounds And Shit On Everyone You Know.’ People buy them! Where is the book that says ‘Here’s How To Never Fill In A TimeSheet Ever Again’ — I would buy that. Read books about shagging and love and mad stuff! Not the thing you do all day! I digress.
My show is about how sometimes I’m not angry at the right things and I do stupid shit and that true equality is ripping the piss out of men and women. The day Mother’s Day cards contain a joke is the day Gloria Steinem can have a quick fag break to relax before cracking on with the serious stuff.
And of course, there are properly awful things going on for women at the moment, but you all know about that too. I’m just inviting you to come and laugh at me for 45 minutes in the back of a pub and maybe sling me a tenner at the end for my efforts. (If you don’t, you’re sexist) A lot of Edinburgh shows are about something moving, poignant, tragic or dark, I’m here to tell you that my parents are both alive, sadly were very supportive of me, and never ask me if I’m going to get married. They fed me almost exclusively Findus Crispy Pancakes and Spaghetti Hoops for about 12 years as well so in many ways, they’re legends. I’ve got nice pals, big dark roots that I can’t afford to dye, and my life has mostly been pretty good, despite my job on the ASDA checkout and Morrisons chicken counter, so you can see my issue. In many ways, making a show out of almost exclusively stupid sexual decisions is actually harder. No pun intended. Well it is now, I wrote it and then realised.
Please come and see Woman In Progress at Southsider, 6th — 17th August, at 5.45pm. You won’t regret it, straight away at least. It’s with PBH Free Fringe, so just pay what you want at the end!
Follow me on Instagram if you liked this [at]alexandrahaddow
Thanks and hopefully see you there!

As a frequent visitor to Edinburgh, I’ve had the opportunity to explore some of the city’s best-kept secrets. While it’s easy to get caught up in the popular tourist attractions, there’s so much more to this beautiful city that often goes unnoticed. Here’s my personal guide to some of Edinburgh’s best hidden gems.
St. Bernard’s Well — Tucked away in the Dean Village, this hidden gem is a peaceful haven away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The well was built in the late 18th century and has a unique design that is said to be based on the Temple of Vesta in Italy. The tranquil setting and stunning architecture make it the perfect spot for a quiet moment of reflection.
The Writers’ Museum — While many visitors flock to the Edinburgh Castle or the National Museum of Scotland, the Writers’ Museum is often overlooked. This hidden gem celebrates the lives and works of three of Scotland’s most famous writers: Robert Burns, Sir Walter Scott, and Robert Louis Stevenson. The museum is located in a 17th-century building just off the Royal Mile and is filled with fascinating artifacts and exhibits.
The Royal Botanic Garden — While not exactly a hidden gem, the Royal Botanic Garden is often overshadowed by other popular attractions in Edinburgh. The garden boasts a vast collection of plant species from around the world, as well as stunning views of the city. It’s the perfect place for a leisurely afternoon stroll or a peaceful picnic.
Stockbridge — This charming neighborhood is just a short walk from the city center, yet it feels like a world away. With its eclectic mix of independent shops, cafes, and restaurants, Stockbridge is a great place to explore and soak up the local culture. Don’t miss the weekly farmers’ market, which is brimming with fresh, locally sourced produce.
The Sheep Heid Inn — Tucked away in the charming village of Duddingston, this historic pub is said to be the oldest in Scotland. The pub’s unique attraction is its skittle alley, a game similar to bowling that’s fun for all ages. It’s a great spot for a pint and a game of skittles with friends.
And now for a joke related to this post — Why did the writer bring a map to the Royal Botanic Garden? To find the roots of all the hidden gems! Okay, maybe it’s not the best joke, but I hope it made you smile.
As a frequent visitor to Edinburgh, I can say that these hidden gems are some of my favorite places in the city. Whether you’re a first-time visitor or a seasoned traveler, I hope this guide inspires you to explore all that Edinburgh has to offer.

I stepped foot in Edinburgh many decades ago and immediately fell in love with the place. That first sight of the city will never leave me, and I still adore the way it holds its head high. It was the strongest against Brexit, it has more graduates as a percentage than virtually any other place on the planet, and it hosts world-class innovation and research. While its infrastructure is never at a scale that the mighty London can achieve in terms of innovation, it is livable, walkable, and a fairly safe place to live.
And, so, I just loved this quote [here]:
The mix of old and new, tradition and innovation, sums up my city. Around its ancient building exists world-leading research and innovation, and, like Glasgow, it is focused on technology and scientific advancements. The city nurtured three of our cybersecurity spin-outs, and I believe we could not have succeeded as well as they did without the help of the city — in supporting investment, collaborations, and most of all, attracting the talent needed to build high-impact companies. While Brexit was a major spanner in the works, the city has managed to showcase its economic resilience — more to do with its people and businesses than by politicians — and continues to build its place on an international stage.
For students, it’s a great place to come and study and is in the Top 10 cities of the world for this. In the QS World guide, the rankings for the best city to study are [here]:
For a relatively small city, a Top 10 finish is amazing. But, it’s not a big city, and that’s a good thing! Many people can live and work within an area that allows you to walk to work, or, at least, get a bus. In fact, Edinburgh buses are great. While we have a new tram, most Edinburgh people still use the bus to get around. You are typically just 30 minutes away from anywhere in Edinburgh.
And, so, if you like hills — Edinburgh has seven of these, and an extinct volcano to walk around. For beaches, you choose whatever style you like, and for parks, you’ll find one at every turn. But, the best thing, is that it is a truly enterprising and innovative city, that prides itself on its love of education and scientific advancement.
Cities are key to our future. They are economic drivers and places to innovation. Care for your city, and let it live.

This week in Edinburgh, GDS hosted its first in-person Design System Day conference. Here are a few of my highlights from the day.
Dynamic Earth felt like a strangely appropriate place to host Design System Day 2023: the giant globe hanging above our heads was a fitting metaphor for the planetary consequences of national scale design decisions.
Samantha Ernstzen and Jennifer l’Anson reflected on the process of creating the Scottish Government Digital Design System.
Their purpose was refreshingly succinct:
“to enable teams within the Scottish public sector to design and build digital products that are accessible, usable and consistent for people accessing public services in Scotland.”
Adoption is always a challenge. Even with a strong design system, people can still put together bad forms with good components! We’ve all seen examples of digitised forms recreating the paper original, mirroring the many-boxes-per-page approach of the pre-digital era.
The challenge isn’t just educating government departments in how best to use a design system, it’s also getting external suppliers to embrace it.
Mandating use of an existing design system isn’t enough: we need to support agencies and consultancies in adopting it and implementing it successfully!
Ciandelle, Calvin and Steve gave a quickfire summary of all the updates GOV.UK have been making, including improving accessibility.
One newly released development is the Exit this page feature. It allows a user to quickly close down a page if they are in danger: particularly useful for those suffering domestic abuse. It may look like just a small button, but took about five years of work to research and implement!
Massive news: designers were delighted to hear that a new crown’s gonna drop — watch this space for a slightly modified GOV.UK logo coming soon!
Katrina Birch facilitated a fantastic panel on trauma-informed research and design.
70% of people have experienced trauma, and 1 in 10 will suffer from PTSD at some point in their life. We should be aware of trauma and the risk of vicarious trauma when conducting user research around difficult topics. Shout out to Chayn, getting an honourable mention for their excellent resources on the topic.
Tash Willcocks closed out the day with her thoughts on the elephant in the room: teams.
Design systems are enablers of scale and consistency, but developing and establishing them requires conditions of high trust and psychological safety.
In short, to save the parrots, we must use the shallot and master the elephant (I promise it made sense, you had to be there).
Thanks so much to all the volunteers and GDS-ers that made Design System Day 2023 possible: it was a glorious gathering of passionate practitioners!
A final quote from the day, sums up nicely the role of design in most organisations:
“We’re not here just to build components and patterns. We make impact through multiplier effects.”
Looking forward to next year!

HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT
I recall standing outside the Pleasance Dome flyering my show a few years ago.
I was exhausted and knew I had to fill a big room and faced losing cash so I was anxious and desperate to make sure people came to see me.
I had rented a good flat and paid for amazing posters and had what I believed to be a fabulous show.
Then I spotted a couple of people who had seen me at a showcase show and had taken my flyer after the gig as they liked my stuff. I brightened up and as I approached them I watched a comedy promoter hand them two free tickets to his latest newly signed act’s show.
They took them. They were FREE.
He had a HUGE wad of free tickets and was giving them to people all around the Pleasance Dome. I lost the sale. I watched and my heart sank as people didn’t give a fuck how funny I had been at the 1pm showcase show.
They had free tickets and free is everything in this current climate.
No doubt the fringe this year yet again will release the BEST EVER SALES AT THE FRINGE and sit back as they manipulate the figures and the PR will spin it good.
I know that the figures aren’t always true, for ONE BIG SELL OUT there are hundreds of smaller shows underwriting them in the big venues and those comics were doing it on their own cash in the hope of a crowd.
Performers go home skint, owing money and are artistically broken.
I have no issue with the big paid venues, I just see issues that the Free Festival can resolve.
On the last weekend of the last few fringe’s I watched BIG NAMED ACTS give away TWO for ONES on the last Thursday and Friday. That’s not a great financial sign and was I aggressively flyered for a comic whose face graces the BILLBOARDS to buy tickets for his ‘EXTRA SOLD OUT SHOW’ which is a weird oxymoron. It can’t be sold out and still have tickets to sell.
Also audience members must be horrified to find out they had paid full price for tickets and realised half the audience were in for free or HALF PRICE and that’s an insult to early bird ticket buyers.
People were so scared of losing face.
This year am back at The Counting House Ballroom as is my daughter comedian Ashley Storrie.
Last year both me and Ashley had a BUMPER run and played to full rooms every day. I had people sitting on the floor of my venue and Ashley had people standing in her room and outside for a chance to get in.
They put cash in the buckets. We left with a profit, a very good profit if truth be told. We also told the crowds if they donated silver and bronze coins we gave that to the homeless and later on we dished it out fairly round the city’s street collectors.
I encouraged other comics and acts to get up and pitch their shows to my big comedy loving full capacity crowd. I tweeted about other comics gigs and helped flyer for other shows. It felt like THE FRINGE.
The people who came to the shows were brilliant.
Dealing with hard cash was weird. I felt like a mid price day time sex worker, I haven’t had that much money in my bag in years. We generally don’t carry much cash as a society now. It reminded me of when I owned a pub and used to count the takings.
People no longer see the Free Festival shows as ‘well it’s free it must be shit’ and I don’t believe they ever did. This is a nice neat rumour and label put on it by the same people who resent the free shows but have no issue giving out free tickets at a paid venue for a show that can’t shift a ticket.
When I did all the big “paid” venues I made thousands of pounds but the financial cut left to me was woeful and I STILL made a profit am one of the few who did. My accountant was stunned by the business model that means you pay for seats in advance and a venue is guaranteed their cash and cut NO MATTER WHAT before you step foot in the capital. The artist takes all the risk. Every seat you dont sell the venue has already been paid for that, the loss is not theirs….it’s YOURS.
Think of it this way…
Imagine you hired a bus with twenty seats, you paid the company for twenty seats….if you only sold 6 of those seats, you lose money.
Now think of that in a 200 seater venue at the fringe where the market is SATURATED with comics giving away FREE SEATS AND TWO FOR ONE SEATS every single day. Now you see my point.
Tax was a well worn phrase when talking about the free venues.
“Yes, but do the free festival comics declare their takings?” one comedy promoter asked me.
I don’t think anybody has the right to assume anyone is fucking their taxes based on a dislike of their business model. If you have an issue with people not paying their due tax please go check some Tory peers before you nitpick at comics you avaricious cunts. While you are at it please make sure the big venues who boast “BEST YEAR EVER” are not putting their profits into an offshore account to avoid taxes in UK.
I pay my tax.
I love the fringe and the past few years doing free fringe shows means I have loved it more. It felt like the old days. It felt good and it felt fair.
I encouraged the people who were skint and living under austerity to come see our shows for free. I also encouraged people who saw the show to take money OUT OF THE BUCKET if they needed some cash.
some tips for acts putting on a FREE SHOW….
Me and My daughter Ashley Storrie are back at the Counting House this year.

Today marked the conclusion of our journey. We had been traveling for nine days and were eager to get home. It had been a while since we had unwinded and slept in our bed at home.
Another reason was my spouse wasn’t feeling well. Our outing in Stonehaven yesterday gave him the chills. We were lucky he did not become ill while traveling, as it would have derailed our entire itinerary.
However, on our final day in Edinburgh, we had one more day of exploring before ending our trip.
After leaving our cabin, we headed towards Dundee on the Tay estuary. Around 11 am, we reached the magnificent city of Dundee. Everything appeared wonderful, and the weather was ideal.
Fun Fact: In 2014, Dundee was recognized by the United Nations as the UK’s first-ever UNESCO City of Design.
We went to a cafe and had a tuna sandwich with coffee. We strolled beside the Tay River. The River Tay is the longest river in Scotland and the seventh-longest in Great Britain.

In the heart of Scotland lies a city steeped in history, culture, and academia: Edinburgh. Home to one of the world’s most prestigious universities, the University of Edinburgh, the city attracts students from all corners of the globe. Among the many challenges that come with starting a new chapter in a different city, finding the perfect accommodation stands as a pivotal moment in a student’s life.
Picture this: a vibrant young student, full of ambition and excitement, stepping foot into the historic cobblestone streets of Edinburgh. For many, this marks the beginning of an incredible journey towards higher education and personal growth. But behind this exciting new chapter lies a quest for the perfect place to call home during these formative years.
For Jamie, a student hailing from London, the search for student accommodation Edinburgh was both thrilling and daunting. Having been accepted into the University of Edinburgh’s prestigious business program, Jamie found himself faced with the task of finding accommodation that suited not only his budget but also his need for a conducive environment for studying.
The quest began online, scrolling through countless listings and options. From shared flats to purpose-built student accommodations, the choices seemed endless. Each listing had its unique charm, promising proximity to the university, modern facilities, and a vibrant community of fellow students.
After much deliberation, Jamie narrowed down his options to a few promising prospects. He decided to visit Edinburgh in person, a decision that would prove invaluable in his search. Stepping into the city, he was greeted by its rich history and the blend of old-world charm with a bustling modernity — a juxtaposition that captured his heart instantly.
His first visit was to a student housing complex located conveniently close to the university. As he walked through the doors, he was met with a lively atmosphere — students chatting in the common areas, engaging in study groups, and overall, a sense of community that was palpable. The rooms were modern, compact yet cozy, equipped with all the essentials a student could need. The allure of being surrounded by like-minded peers was tempting.
However, Jamie wanted to explore other options before making a decision. He ventured into the heart of the city, where charming old buildings were converted into student flats. The historic ambiance was undeniable, but the rooms were often smaller and lacked some of the modern amenities he had seen in the purpose-built accommodations.
Then came the visit to a shared flat — a common choice among students looking for a more independent living experience. The prospect of living with a few roommates excited Jamie. The flat was spacious, with each room uniquely decorated, reflecting the personalities of its occupants. The idea of creating a home away from home with fellow students felt appealing, fostering a sense of camaraderie.
After careful consideration and weighing the pros and cons of each option, Jamie ultimately chose to reside in the purpose-built student accommodation. Its proximity to the university, modern amenities, and the vibrant community it offered aligned perfectly with his aspirations for his university life.
Settling into his new accommodation, Jamie found himself surrounded by a diverse group of students — each with their own stories, cultures, and ambitions. The communal spaces became a hub for socializing, studying, and forging lifelong friendships.
Living in student accommodation in Edinburgh wasn’t just about having a place to stay; it was an integral part of Jamie’s university experience. It became the backdrop for late-night study sessions, impromptu gatherings, and the formation of lasting bonds.
As Jamie delved deeper into his studies, he realized that the choice of accommodation had a profound impact on his overall university journey. The convenience, the sense of community, and the support from fellow students made navigating the challenges of university life more manageable.
Looking back, Jamie reminisces about the thrill of finding the perfect place to live in Edinburgh. It wasn’t just a roof over his head; it was the cornerstone of his university adventure — a place where he didn’t just reside but truly belonged.
For any student venturing into the vibrant city of Edinburgh, the quest for accommodation may seem like a daunting task, but it’s a journey filled with choices that shape an unforgettable university experience — a journey much like Jamie’s, filled with exploration, decisions, and ultimately, a place to call home.

Glasgow, Edinburgh’s younger and cheekier brother. A winter’s visit to this exciting city filled me with a lot of excitement. The journey began with a night bus from London Victoria to Buchanan Street Station, north of the English/ Scottish border. As soon as I arrived on the bus, I was surrounded by the echoes of the thick Glaswegian accent. Coupled with that were men chewing away on Sainsbury’s 5 packs of donuts and mothers and daughters arguing about who had the window seat. Presumably the views from the Megabus up the M40 and M6 overnight weren’t to be missed. On arrival at 7am into Glasgow, it was still dark. I was due to visit one of my oldest friends, Greg Bond, however I would first be met by his namesake, Greggs, who provided me with a coffee and Pan au Chocolat to welcome me to Scotland. The sun only lights up the city 30 minutes after it would in London, which is also known for its excellent weather. I wandered through the chartered streets of the city where I was surprised by an incredible orange and yellow sunset that crept over the Lanarkshire hills and the schemes that fill Glasgow’s skyline.
Arching past the Glasgow Necropolis (the cemetery) and the Tennents beer factory, I wandered to the East End of the city to meet Greg and his girlfriend, Jess. We soon headed to Tibo Bistro, a local Scottish brunch eatery where I tried my first full Scottish breakfast. This included, black pudding and haggis, both of which I hadn’t tried for a very long time but were incredibly tasty. Glasgow has an excellent selection of restaurants, notably to add, the Ubiquitous Chip, which I previously visited in 2016 on my first visit to this city (I would highly recommend both of these places). The rest of the day would be spent hopping around bars and watching football, the hoops (Celtic) no less were playing at home and some of the bars refused to show the premier league but rather would show the Scottish games. It’s understandable, really. You got a real sense of how strong the local identity is in Glasgow. Not only from the accent and their pride towards either Rangers or Celtic Football Clubs but also from their use of language. Words you would never use in the South of England, or internationally in this language. ‘Spu*k’, ‘C*nt’ and ‘Sh*te’ are all very much on the table and part of the local tongue. Jess mentioned this is just part of the Glasgwegian identity and people of all ages, with the exception of really formal events or in the company of elderly family, would people liberallly use these words. For example, Jess said ‘I don’t want to sp*nk all my money away travelling’. The sense of irony was real for me here.
We stopped for a bite to eat at a chicken burger joint, complemented naturally by a pint of Tennents, of course. Here, we met Greg’s friends Gus, with whom he shared his birthday event with that evening and Zac, who I’d met many moons ago while he and Greg were at university here. We then headed to a bar called the rum shack, where we met more of their friends, most of whom were from Greg and Gus’ former and current hockey clubs. Being in Glasgow and with a lot of sporty, sociable folks, this made for quite a drink heavy evening. We played a game called ‘ou l’est le poulet’, which literally translates from French as ‘where is the chicken?’. Here, Gus and Greg identified themselves as the ‘chickens’ and they organised a kitty of money for drinks for them and whoever could find them throughout the night. They selected 15–20 bars within a few miles radius of the rum shack and they said the first to meet us at the one they were at will be able to benefit from the complimentary drinks from the budget. The first there would receive a Champagne reception. Luckily, I was with two local Glaswegian blokes who knew Greg, Gus and the city very well so we made it to this grand reception after stopping at only 2 other pubs on the way to the Ivory hotel. The Ivory was an eyesore geographically away from the collection of other proposed pubs. We thought we’d go and check it just to be sure, but we didn’t genuinely believe that they’d actually be there. As the rest of the groups arrived, we then settled into the drinks from the kitty as well as some tasty nachos. The night continued from the Ivory hotel to another bar in town. After 12 hours on the beers on the back of a night bus, I decided to call it an evening before my flight home in the morning back to London town. All in all, I’d highly recommend this city for food, drinking and a good time watching sport. But keep an eye and an ear open for the Glaswegian tongue.

When Henry was a wee one I read to him every night. He’d pick two or three picture books from his bookshelf, and we’d cuddle in the couch or his bed, and read together. As a train fanatic he had quite a few train books, and Slow Train from Oxmox was one of his favorites.
The little book was about just that, a slow train goes through the country and encounters animals and assorted obstacles. It’s whimsical and cheerful, perfect for a night time story.
When I spent a little over two weeks in London in April, one of my goals was to venture outside the city and explore other parts of UK. I picked Edinburgh for the second weekend. For years Edinburgh Yarn Festival was one of the go-to fiber events in Europe, and I’m still kicking myself for not making it in 2019, because no one knew that was going to be the last one. Regardless, Edinburgh the city still held my intense interest and I decided that was my destination for the weekend.
The train from Kings Cross Station in London to Edinburgh is a little over five hours on LNER line (LNER stands for London North Eastern Railway and is pronounced with the letters spelled out, not “liner” as I first thought), and the route goes along the east side of England, at some point right by the beach. The views are stunning. — Side note, after the trip I rewatched Harry Potter movies. I can’t tell you how thrilling it was to see the LNER trains in the background every time they were in Kings Cross Station.
I took off from London on Friday morning, spent Friday evening to Sunday morning in Edinburgh. I booked the return trip to leave around 1:30pm, so I’d have lunch in Edinburgh and be back in London for dinner. The train ride is very comfortable with free wifi and electric outlets, so I could listen to my audiobook while knitting, or napping. I had a window seat facing forward as I picked, and most of the time the seat next to me was empty.
About an hour outside of London, suddenly there was loud metal screeching and the train lurched forward, eventually came to a stop, but not before there was a big thump, hitting something big. Soon the conductor’s voice came through the scratchy speaker, yes, there was a deer on the track and the train hit it; yes, the engineers would have to check out the damage, and no, no one could get off the train. Of course they would keep the passengers updated. But what about Bambi??
So we wait. Every ten minutes or so the conductor came on the speaker, still checking the damage, getting help from the next station, possibly moving everyone to another train. Just how big was Bambi? Maybe Bambi was a big boy with big horns, big enough to cause the train to lose air pressure. The next, closest, station was fifteen minutes away, and from the conductor’s voice, the engineers wondered aloud if the train would be able to go that far with the damage, or have another train fetch all the passengers. Neither option seem comforting when you are in the middle of the beautiful but remote English countryside. I looked on Google Map and the only thing nearby was a tiny nursery school. I wondered where the kids came from.
More than an hour after the thump, a train materialized itself on the track next to our train, going the same direction(!), and very slowly came to a stop(!!). Passengers started moving around, gathering their bags— are we being rescued? How do we all fit in that already packed train? Before we knew it, just like how it came, the train slowly started moving again, and minutes later, gone.
Now what? I’m sure I wasn’t the only one started calculating how much water and food might be in our luggage and in the dining car.
Apparently the other train dropped off some engineers, because soon there were a bunch of people in bright neon green and orange garb walking along the tracks, toward the head of our train.
More waiting. Thirty minutes later the train moved! And continued to run like nothing happened, till it unceremoniously stopped at the next station, Peterborough, where everyone was ordered to pack their things and depart, find their own ways. I guess all this was announced in the running gargles from the conductor, and I wasn’t the only one confused once we landed on the cold platform. Now it’s up to this tiny station to deal with hundreds of unexpected passengers heading to London, already delayed for hours.
You got to give it to the British for efficiency. The little station handled the glitch better than most American airports. The digital display spelled out clearly how many trains are passing and heading to Kings Cross in the next hour, which cars had seats, and what section of the platform had the best chance to get on the train. No one checked tickets. The bathroom queue went from over fifty to none. By the third train most people were out of the station and on their way to London.
I arrived at Kings Cross past 11pm, more than four hours after planned, cold and hungry. I was ready for a hot meal and warm bed.

Edinburgh during the fringe is a glorious celebration of the artistic spirit, with any tourist walking down the Royal Mile sure to be deluged with flyers from young people eager to promote their low-budget show. While having a coffee in George Square, I was approached by someone hawking a one-person re-enactment of the Titanic disaster, an improvised musical called Shamilton and a lady (with a haystack hairdo) impersonating Melania Trump.
But the image that most visitors will take away from the 2022 fringe is of overflowing rubbish bins and gutters strewn with discarded coffee cups and takeaway meal cartons. The binmen were on a two-week strike. The dispute has since spread through much of the rest of Scotland.
The refuse collectors are protesting about a 5% pay offer which they rightly point out will not match the rate of inflation. The pay “rise” is thus, in real terms, a pay cut. Small wonder that they are protesting.
But the speed with which Edinburgh descended into slovenliness is an illustration of the theme I wrote about in my last book, More; that our standard of living depends on the efforts and co-operation of millions of strangers. It is not just that we eat food that was grown on the other side of the world or rely on communication tools made in Asia. We depend on our fellow citizens to educate our children, keep us healthy, defend our borders and clean our streets.
This co-operation faces two interlinked threats. The first is that international trade in goods and services relies on a willingness to trust other countries, and to place economic interests above strategic desires. The first great era of globalisation in the late 19th century saw vast levels of migration from Europe to the “new worlds” of North and South America, and monetary co-operation that allowed the Bank of England to borrow from its counterparts in France and Russia when its gold reserves were low. But it all disintegrated with the outbreak of war in 1914; world trade (as measured by exports as a proportion of GDP) did not recover until the 1970s.
The late 19th century era has been dubbed the “pax Britannica” as Britain was the centre of the international monetary system (the gold standard) and, through its navy, ensured that global seaborne trade was safe from piracy. And the post-1945 era could be dubbed the “pax Americana” as the US supported its European (and Japanese allies) both militarily and economically. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the post-Mao change in Chinese economic policy brought most of the world into the global trading system.
Might we see another great reversal? There is little evidence of it in the data so far. But the rhetoric is headed in one direction: sanctions on Russia, tariffs on China and a determination in many countries, after the pandemic, to ensure that some strategically important goods are produced at home. The recent sabre-rattling of China over Taiwan might be an indicator of the next tipping point.
The second threat to co-operation lies in domestic politics. In part, this stems from globalisation which is perceived in many western countries as being good for the highly-educated elite but bad for ordinary workers. There has definitely been a slowdown in the growth rate of real earnings of the average worker in recent decades and in most countries, rising inequality. There is a vigorous debate among economists as to the causes of this shift with technological change playing at least as big a role as globalisation.
But this sluggish growth in real incomes has broken the contract between politicians and the people they govern, in which votes are supplied in return for increased prosperity. That has fuelled the disillusionment with politicians that was the subject of an earlier book of mine, The Last Vote. This discontent has meant constraints in democracy in some countries where its roots are shallow, such as Russia and Hungary. And in western countries it has led to the rise of “nativist” politicians like Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen, who imply that a “globalist” elite is plotting to undermine their countries.
How serious is this threat? It is easy to forget that Donald Trump lost the popular vote in both 2016 and 2020, taking office only because of the vagaries of the electoral college system. But his attempt to cling on to office in 2020 showed how tenuous are the institutional supports for democracy in the US; it was only the honesty of a few Republican officials in swing states that prevented him from stealing the election. In this category, one might add the outrageous attempt by the Conservative party to prorogue the British Parliament in 2019, a step that was blocked by the Supreme Court in an 11–0 decision.
In her book “How Civil Wars Start”, Barbara Walter details her research into the crucial factors that can cause a descent into chaos; excessive factionalism, the politics of resentment and the existence of armed groups. In particular, she refers to the existence of “anocracy” where a nominal democracy exists but the institutional structure that supports it (independent courts, a free press etc) have been undermined.
Anocracies can often descend into dictatorship, as Russia has shown. But they can head in another direction, as happened in Lebanon in the 1980s and Yugoslavia as the state’s authority disintegrates into regional and religious factions. Ms Walter is not predicting a re-enactment of the US Civil War of the 1860s, with uniformed armies fighting pitched battles, but a steady descent into chaos.
And if one looks at history, it is replete with examples of states disintegrating in the face of internal and external challenges. The western Roman empire was declining long before Rome was sacked in 410CE or Romulus Augustulus, the last emperor, was deposed in 476CE. The Hapsburg dynastic empire, steadily assembled over many centuries, disintegrated within weeks in 1918. Chaos is as likely an outcome as dictatorship.
The concept that Britain is only “four meals away from anarchy” has been used by MI5 to assess strategic risks and variations of the quote have been attributed to Lenin and the scifi writers Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. The original quote seems to have come from Alfred Henry Lewis back in 1896 who wrote” that the only barrier between us and anarchy is the last nine meals we’ve had” .
Back in the 1970s, a time when the country was rocked by high inflation, strikes and energy shortages, there was talk that Britain was “ungovernable”. There have been moments since then, notably during the riots of 2011, when the veneer of society has worn very thin.
The very connections that supply us with our food, energy and gadgets are also a source of our vulnerability, which could come in the form of embargoes, blockades or cyberattacks. Specialisation, which is at the heart of the modern economy, means that few of us have the means or the expertise to support ourselves.
Turmoil in America also affects the rest of the developed world since the post-1945 global settlement is built on the US’s economic and military strength. In 410CE, faced with Saxon incursions, the British wrote to Rome to appeal for help (according to one historical account). The emperor Honorius replied that they must look to their own defence. Isolationists in the US argue that Europe should do the same.
One can map out a future for the world in which the bonds that tie together the US and Europe disintegrate in the face of Russian and Chinese pressure, declining living standards provoke unrest at home which leads to violence on the streets, and public services break down leading to an even further decline in welfare.
This outcome is still only a possibility rather than a probability. But it is an outcome we should all consider before voting for those who would destroy the global economic structure.

I am a Student Ambassador with the University of Edinburgh. My job is to give tours of the university to visitors, prospective students and to anybody who is interested in the university. I mostly work for the department of Student Recruitment and Admissions and for Edinburgh Global, but I can be contracted by any department of the university. I am expected to help out on Open Days, School Visits, Alumni Events, teacher training sessions and on visits from International Delegations of other Universities.
On Open Days I give out leaflets, show people around the campus and just make them feel in general comfortable around the university.
In some cases I go on Schools visits either with my department of the School of Geosciences or the general student recruitment team.
Being a Student Ambassador is a real job with real pay. I even have a LinkedIn entry on it!
https://uk.linkedin.com/in/hunor-de%C3%A1k-458503121
I conduct university tours around the Central Campus/King’s Buildings, do office work, take part in student Q&A sessions, help with student support staff training, represent the university on school visits and help to organise/run university Open Days. I work for the Student Recruitment & Admissions, Edinburgh Global and Go Abroad Edinburgh.
Student Ambassadors are the face of the University of Edinburgh to prospective students, their parents/carers and teachers/advisers. The Student Ambassador team consists of 75 students, both UG and PG, from a range of Schools, Colleges, backgrounds and nationalities. The scheme is primarily designed to support the work of the Student Recruitment and Admissions Team and Edinburgh Global, however, from time to time Student Ambassadors have the opportunity to work for a range of other departments from around the University.
This is the official spiel. Looked over by university officials and decided in advance. To be honest I don’t really like this description, as it removes the honesty from my work.
In reality being a student ambassador is so much more than a job! It is a gift and an experience.
I get to work with a diverse range of people, and a diverse age range of people. I showed Primary school pupils around Appleton Tower, I introduced Scottish food to new students from around the globe and helped run an event at St Cecilia’s Hall for the old Alumni who graduated with the university 40–50 years ago. As a Student Ambassador I met such a nice number of people.
I worked under the wings of so many interesting university leaders as well.
Through the scheme I met so many fellow Student Ambassadors, that if I would have a thousand hands with hundreds of fingers I wouldn’t be able to count them! I met people from St. Petersburg, Florida, Vienna, the Netherlands, south California. I saw a wide range of departments from helping to host a music night to the alumni at St Cecilia’s Hall to handing out goodie bags to the newly graduated students of the University. I have done everything from office work for ERASMUS+ to waste management and moving boxes in the dungeons.
Being a Student Ambassador helped to improve my speaking skills, trained me to work better as a member of a group and gave me a greater range of confidence.
The University of Edinburgh is an ancient Scottish institution that educated the great Men of the Scottish Enlightenment, revolutionised the world of science and produced global leaders.
The university is a warm and welcoming place where I built up lots of skills for employment.
Step into the world that is the University of Edinburgh!

Peter Drake, a teacher from Hexham in Britain, spent many years in the classroom encouraging the learning of science. In recent years, Peter has found a new path in writing, music, and the arts. Today, he uses his experience to inspire others, proving that life after teaching can be just as rewarding and full of new adventures and doesn’t need to take place in the classroom.
Some cities make an impression the moment you arrive. Others take a little time, revealing their beauty and character slowly. Edinburgh, however, is in a category all of its own — a place that doesn’t just leave an impression but sears itself into your memory, heart, and soul. For me, Edinburgh’s allure is most powerful during that extraordinary moment each year when the Edinburgh Festival Fringe transforms the city into the beating heart of global creativity.
Every August, this historic Scottish capital erupts into life, laughter, noise, and energy. Streets that are usually relatively calm thrum with a chaotic symphony of buskers, actors, dancers, musicians, and visitors from all corners of the world. Cafés spill over with animated conversation, parks host pop-up performances, and every available space — from traditional theatres to tiny basements — is pressed into service for the arts. If ever a city could wear joy like a cloak, it is Edinburgh during the Fringe.
I feel deeply connected to Edinburgh, not least because of my own unforgettable experience of the Fringe. Some years ago, my play, The Prisoner’s Friend, was performed during the festival. Seeing a piece of writing, crafted over months of quiet work, take on a new life before an audience of strangers in such a vibrant setting was a defining moment for me. There is something intoxicating about watching people react to your words — to hear them laugh, to see them fall silent with emotion, to feel that invisible thread of understanding stretch between stage and audience. For anyone who has created, performed, or even simply spectated during the Fringe, the memory leaves an indelible mark.
During that month, the city itself becomes more than just a backdrop; it feels like an active participant in the festival. The ancient streets and winding closes seem to lean in, listening. The grand, stern buildings of the New Town provide a dramatic stage set, while the narrow, atmospheric lanes of the Old Town whisper history and secrets around every corner. There’s a profound sense that Edinburgh is uniquely suited to house such an explosion of creativity — a city proud of its culture, deeply aware of its own myths and legends, yet refreshingly willing to let loose and celebrate the new.
Of course, part of what makes the Fringe experience so powerful is the sense of freedom it offers. Nowhere else in the world can so many performers, both seasoned professionals and complete beginners, share space so democratically. Whether your production has a massive budget or is fueled solely by passion and a few hand-painted posters, the Fringe offers a platform. It is, at heart, a celebration of taking a risk, of putting yourself and your art in front of the world without guarantees or safety nets.
That spirit permeated everything during the time I spent there. Days were crammed with rehearsals, flyering on the Royal Mile, frantic last-minute set changes, and post-show discussions in packed pubs. Nights were filled with laughter, new friendships, and a thrilling sense of community. For one glorious month, you become part of a tribe — a massive, sprawling, creative tribe that welcomes anyone willing to leap into the unknown.
I often think about those August days and nights, and the way they stand in contrast to the quieter months when the festival has packed up and the city breathes a little easier. Yet even outside of August, Edinburgh remains magnificent. Climb Arthur’s Seat for a panoramic view of a city that seamlessly marries medieval and modern. Walk through the peaceful elegance of the Georgian New Town, with its perfectly symmetrical streets and squares. Explore the mysteries of the Old Town, where narrow closes and hidden courtyards make you feel as though you might step into another century.
And always, whether it’s August or April, the city’s commitment to culture shines through. From the National Museum of Scotland to the Scottish National Gallery, from the historic libraries to the storytelling centres, Edinburgh is a place where history, art, and ideas are not just preserved but celebrated.
For me personally, the emotional connection to Edinburgh will always be anchored in that heady, transformative experience of the Fringe. It’s not just about the performances or the audiences — it’s about being part of something larger than yourself. It’s about feeling, even for a brief time, that you are contributing to a shared celebration of imagination, creativity, and human connection.
Every year when August rolls around, I feel a twinge of longing. I picture the crowds gathering, the pop-up stages going up, the laughter echoing down the cobbled streets. I imagine first-time performers nervously stepping onto stages, writers seeing their characters come to life, audiences discovering unexpected delights in hidden venues.
Few who have performed at the Fringe ever forget it. The highs are high, the lows can be humbling, but the memories are golden. Whether your show draws a full house or plays to a handful, whether you win awards or simply win the respect of your peers, the experience changes you. It reminds you that art matters. That risk matters. That connection — raw, real, immediate connection — is what we all crave, and occasionally, in a special place like Edinburgh during the Fringe, we find it.
In a world that sometimes feels increasingly fragmented and divided, that spirit of celebration and connection feels more precious than ever. And so I will always hold Edinburgh close — not just as a stunning city of history and beauty, but as a place where, for a brief, shining moment, anything feels possible.

“This is a city of shifting light, of changing skies, of sudden vistas. A city so beautiful it breaks the heart again and again.”
― Alexander McCall Smith
As the sun rises, I watch the city of Edinburgh slowly revealed… a dark foggy nothingness giving way to a thousand rooftops accented by a spire here and there, dark and unfocused at first, but gradually taking on shape, form, and color. Finally, the edge of the sun peeks over the horizon and dazzling light spills into and across the room, putting a sudden and audible end to muffled conversations.
The bride and groom touch, and she whispers something softly into his ear. Both turn to look out the open window. On the table beside them, a once-full bottle of fine malt, a dozen empty glasses, and a stone jug of spring water sit where they were last touched.
“Wow… Look at that!” from the kilted man wearing the splendid red uniform tunic.
I have no words to adequately describe the scene being painted below as the sun continues its steady, lazy morning stretch, revealing a hilltop here, a wisp of smoke from a chimney there, the ancient castle perched to our left, and the blue ocean in the distance bathed…

Let’s all collectively ignore that this article is late (I need a lot of grace these days 😭)
Hi guys! It’s been a HOT minute (ironically😅). I know, I take full responsibility for my prolonged absence. The past several months have been a lot; mentally, emotionally, and physically. I can only say thank God for His grace through it all.
I have a lot to say and so much gist for you guys
The first thing I’d like to share is the different aspects of my first half-year on the other side of the globe.
Transportation
One of my favourite things about living here is the transportation system. Gone are the days of fighting passengers to enter a bus and fighting bus conductors for change. The transportation system I have experienced here (mostly buses) is more comfortable and seamless.
Most buses I’ve used are double-decker with an upper level for passengers to sit. Bus fares are paid with exact amounts, prepaid bus cards, free bus travel cards, or contactless payment methods. And yes, I said free bus travel. Scotland has free bus travel for under 22s, over 60s and disabled travellers.
There are accessibility accommodations on buses such as designated seats for elderly travellers, disabled travellers, and people with buggies.
For the most part, you don’t have to wait endlessly for the bus. Bus delays are often communicated on electronic displays at bus stops and Google Maps (which is usually more accurate). Any changes in bus stops or bus routes are well communicated to passengers in advance.
Besides the buses, there are trams and trains, modes of transportation that I wasn’t familiar with before living here. Cycling is also a thing here (I’ve even tossed around the idea of getting a bicycle a few times).
Since being here, I have learnt to embrace walking as part of my everyday life. These days a 21-minute walk is just a nice little exercise. The roads are well-designed to accommodate pedestrian traffic and motorists obey traffic rules, so I no longer have hypertension whenever I cross the road.
Compared to how clueless I was when I first arrived, I’ve largely settled into making my way downtown, walkin’ fast faces pass and I’m home-bound (tadadadadada). Ma da mi loun, I’m not a serious geh😜
Every once in a while though, I miss the thrill of rushing around and the fun of Danfo drama, I’m a Lagos girl after all.
Advice: Wear comfortable shoes, walking becomes a part of you
Weather
The stark difference in weather has been the most jarring part of moving to Edinburgh. I’ve never lived in a place with four actual seasons before and it’s an experience I can’t fully express. So far, I’ve experienced Winterrrr 🥶, gorgeous Spring, Summer (ish), and Autumn-yet to be decided.
Winter almost broke me😭
It was cold, or as the wobble-headed narrator of the Oversimplified YouTube channel says “STUPID COLD!” I made many a perilous journey to and from class, but like they say, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger 💪🏽. I held out hope every freezing day, for the relief of a warm summertime that everyone seemed to eagerly expect.
UNFORTUNATELY, it was all a SCAM! 😭
Spring was cold, Summer was cold, Autumn is COLD.
Oh, and apart from the low temperatures, there are wind speeds that go over vehicle speed limits and rains that appear out of nowhere. It is a fascinating experience.
Am I used to it? I don’t think it’s something to get used to honestly. I want to get used to nice things; like someone spending money on me, living a baby girl lifestyle, you know, nice things.
Advice: Expect any weather, and always carry an umbrella
The Environment, The People
Scotland is beautiful and Edinburgh is stunning.
As erratic as the weather can be here, the skies are a deep and beautiful shade of blue, the sun (when it decides to grace us with its presence) shoots down golden rays to illuminate the greenery, and on the rarest of occasions, I have seen the most perfectly coloured rainbows adorn a pale-bright sky.
The city is a spectacular landscape surrounded by hills and dotted with the most luscious trees and shrubs. Breathtaking (see Exhibit A below). Exploring Edinburgh’s rich scenery, heritage and uniqueness deserves a post of its own (coming soon? fingers crossed)
Now for the people.
At this point, I’m pretty sure Scottish people don’t speak English. They speak a language only they can understand. Fair warning: if you can understand English, don’t expect to automatically understand Scottish English.
Picture this: You go to eat at a fancy with a whole bar section for drinks. You look at the list of nice-sounding beverages and decide you're too broke (for now) to afford them, so you walk up to the bar and ask for a glass of water. You’re greeted with a smile and a nod. “This is going well.” you think as the bartender fills a glass with tap water (don’t worry, it’s clean). You’re about to stretch your hand when the bartender asks “Dyu like some aeyce?” Now you’re lost. “What is aeyce?” “Does it cost extra?” “How do I respond?”.
The bartender senses the activation of your flight-freeze response and points at the ice bucket next to the counter. Ice. He’s asking if you want ice 🤦🏽‍♀️
Excuse me for that long scenario, I haven’t written fiction in a while and I quite enjoyed that.
Back to the story.
Their weird rendition of English aside, I see Scottish people like regular people, with the good and the not-so-good. There’s a general “mind your business” vibe here which isn’t necessarily good or bad. However, seeing some of the effects of this way of life has made me appreciate that the cultural system of community involvement in personal and interpersonal matters can be quite valuable.
Edinburgh is full of people from all over the world, which is expected of any tourist city. Going from a racially homogenous place like Nigeria to a vastly multicultural hub like this is like exploring a whole new world. I have heard many new languages, seen many new faces and experienced many new cultures.
Side note: I finally ate Chinese, Indian and Italian food; it was all delicious, you should try them too.
Community (Nigerian shops, Nigerian students, Nigerian food)
This probably goes without saying, but there are Nigerians in Edinburgh. There are Nigerian grocery shops and hairstylists in Edinburgh. Just as in places like London and Manchester, there is a flourishing Nigerian community in Edinburgh.
When I arrived at my school, I was surprised to be surrounded by Nigerians in class and at the hostel. In some ways, it felt like I never left Nigeria. Ironically, I have learnt more about Nigeria in Edinburgh than I ever learnt in Nigeria.
Having a community of people who can relate to my perspective is refreshing. I’ve made some great friends here who are simply amazing.
Side note: I’ve also made friends from other countries; trust me, it’s not as hard as it seems.
I’m loving my time here in Edinburgh, and getting that nice abroad weight gain (no exhibits here). I’ll share more about my life in Edinburgh as time goes on. Let me know any specific things you want me to talk about😊.
I’ll try not to disappear for too long next time. Thank you for your constant support and patience. I love you guys!

Since 2016, Edinburgh council has slowly been rolling out on-street storage for cyclists. In the last year, the number of hangars has doubled from 100 to over 200.
64% of Edinburgh households live in flats, and we know that finding somewhere to store a bicycle is one of the more important barriers to people moving around on two wheels. With about 300,000 people in capital in such a predicament, and with 6 spots per cycle hangar… you can do the maths.
One hangar location near Stockbridge has 142 people on the waiting list.
It is therefore not a surprise that the new hangars are massively over-subscribed. The waiting list has grown to 3,400, including those in the queue for an existing hangar and those who have requested one.
This latent demand for cycling is being realised, and in a big way. As new hangars go in they become a visible part of our public realm and more and more people become aware of them.
As things stand, the council will need to install a further 560 hangars to meet demand. Over 1,000 people joined the queue in the last year or so; if replicated this year, that’s another 170 hangars required on top of that.
Yet the council only has plans for around another 160.
Each cycle hangar takes up the space taken by one car. Parking permits are a significant source of revenue for the council. But so are cycle hangars…
At full price, a cycle hangar spot costs £72 per year. That compares favourably with car parking, which is either free in most of the city, or £36.50 for a zero carbon emissions car (except in the very centre of the city, where it’s £73.70).
Taking that £36.50 figure, each hangar will generate 12 times as much revenue as a car parking spot. That doesn’t take into account maintenance costs of the hangars, but after all the negative externalities associated with cars… it’s a good investment.
Indeed, if the council were a private business, they’d push those prices up even higher to meet demand.
Cycle hangars have been so far placed in the more prosperous parts of the city; Marchmont, Newington, Bruntsfield, Portobello — you get the picture. This is efficient work from the council as most of the demand for the cycle hangars is located in these areas.
However, conscious of the social inequity of providing such infrastructure in only the richer parts of town, a number of hangars have been located in areas of high deprivation. Even better, these are provided at a subsidised cost of only £1.50 a month.
This has not been successful. Some of these hangars are those few that have not been populated by bicycles. It is my view that the barriers to cycling for those on the lowest incomes remain the relatively large capital investment associated with the bicycle itself. The low cost and low risk associated with Lothian Buses’ excellent service is difficult to beat.
An interactive map of hangars, waiting lists and demand can be found here: LINK
This article has been based on a Freedom of Information request to Edinburgh City Council, which you can find here: LINK
While there is precise location data for existing hangars, requests for hangars are made on a street-by-street basis. I have used the postcode associated with each street and used the centroid of that postcode area to map requests.

I stood at the gated entrance on Candlemaker Row of the 16th-century Greyfriars Kirkyard. The wind whipped the leafless trees, and the sky threatened to rain. The weather was suitable for exploring a graveyard, especially one that proclaims to be the most haunted graveyard in the world in one of the most haunted cities, Edinburgh, Scotland.
Although I had not been there before, there was something familiar about the place as soon as I walked in.
It was my second visit to Edinburgh, and this time, I returned in January when the hordes of tourists were gone. I had seen the city’s most well-known sights, like Edinburgh Castle, Holyrood Palace, and the Royal Mile, which left me free to explore lesser-known places.
Greyfriars Kirkyard piqued my interest as I read a list of suggested things to do in Edinburgh. The graveyard was established during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots, and was full of victims from the Black Plague and the witch hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries, in which around four thousand…

Hello again from my work world developing a new ten-year fund for communities in Edinburgh to work together as part of a wider system to work in regenerative ways to get deep into the root causes of big issues in our city— poverty, racism and climate change.
I’ve never written as consistently about one topic before — this is my 15th blog in a series about developing Regenerative Futures Fund, with another 4 in there about Funding Utopias.
In April 2024 my writing was about Inching Closer to Launch, closing off and reflecting on our wonderful co-design groups.
In September 2024 I mused about Good Hosting, Floating and Anchoring, when I was feeling grateful for all who supported the more ‘behind the scenes things’ — WHALE Arts, EVOC and Foundation Scotland.
And then more recently I reflected on working with poets on our Collective Imagination programme and our beautiful poetry anthology All That Is Needed Is A Dream.
So — here is my more general Regenerative Futures Fund update for the second half of 2024 and first part of 2025🌿
This was also shared on our Regenerative Futures Fund ‘News & Notes’ section in February 2025 — a PDF of the update copied below can be downloaded here.
1. Fund Design — Process, Participation & Programme
2. Recruitment and Team Development
3. Communications and Open Working
4. Governance Ecosystem (and Hosting)
5. Fundraising and Contracting
6. Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability and Learning (MEAL)
7. Field Building & Systems — Learning Partnerships, Sharing the Model
If anything chimes, please do get in touch
Please do get in touch if you have any questions or you’d like to get involved: Leah Black (Co-Head) — leah@foundationscotland.org.uk

4 reasons why the Kimpton Charlotte Square is the most romantic hotel in Edinburgh,https://medium.com/laura-metze-luxury-travel-writer/4-reasons-why-the-kimpton-charlotte-square-is-the-most-romantic-hotel-in-edinburgh-79d5856b1611,"Sign up

Edinburgh’s charm is so idyllic, it’s been a muse to writers for centuries. It’s only fitting that this is where the Kimpton Charlotte Square sits, a serene hideaway, full to overflowing with everything needed for a romantic escape. I recently stayed two nights there on a wedding anniversary tour of Edinburgh where I found four reasons why this hotel is the most romantic in the city.
Follow the author to be notified when new luxury travel articles are published.
Close your eyes and imagine a scene from a classic piece of literature (one of the cheerier volumes). What you dreamed up likely comes very close to the Kimpton Charlotte Square. A wicker basket props up black Mary Poppins umbrellas next to a stately Georgian door. Red bicycles fitted with silver bells patiently wait for their next outing on a herringbone tile floor. A dancing fire in a massive stone fireplace warms the room and the mood. A couple chats animatedly in the library and garden greenery weaves its way from the outdoors in, bringing a taste of a summer garden with it. This was what greeted us as we explored the common rooms on our first night. Even story settings don’t get as romantic as this.
On our second night, we decided to take a dip in the indoor swimming pool. There’s nothing like a spontaneous swim, taken purely for fun (with no attempt to get a workout in) to bring up memories of the exciting first rush of love. Do try it.
When the day draws you and your love outside, Edinburgh is at your feet, literally. Kimpton Charlotte Square is in New Town (built between 1767 and 1890 while Old Town is medieval). Shops full of Harris Tweed tartan handbags and beautifully packaged shortbread biscuits, plus one-of-a-kind treasures are two to ten minutes away on foot. Edinburgh wasn’t bombed as badly as London was during WW2, so the gorgeous period architecture is laid out in unbroken ribbons along the city’s cobbled streets. The baked goods in Edinburgh are second-to-none. If you’ve never tried chocolate and caramel-topped millionaire shortbread, you haven’t lived. Don’t miss out; it will transform your expectations of dessert forever. Cabs or buses are plentiful when it’s time to go to Old Town. Or, if you don’t mind a very scenic walk, Old Town can be reached in about 20 minutes on foot. As you’re bound to get distracted constantly by fabulous shops and scenery, plan for more.
Discovering a tin full of goodies in the room was my first delightful foodie surprise. Rich chocolate bars and well-chosen savoury snacks fed my habit of late-night snacking on both nights of our stay. Even better was dinner on our second night. We ate our fill at BABA, a restaurant that feels like the best version of a Middle Eastern bazaar. BABA is a vibrantly hued maze of open areas that buzz with conversation, and intimate tables framed with heavy velvet curtains, made for a quiet meal. My hummus and pita bread was so wonderful, I nearly skipped to dessert. I’m glad I didn’t though, as the cod with grilled celeriac and cashews was tender and flavourful. My husband had the pork with red pepper ketchup, feta cheese and banana chilies, which he must have loved as he cleaned his plate.
For variety, there are two other restaurants on-site, Aizle (featuring a six-course tasting menu) and The Garden, a scenic, light-filled café that serves coffee and sandwiches until 3 PM.
After dinner and a day of exploration, I craved a hot shower and soft bed. I got both in our beautiful one-bedroom partitioned suite that overlooked the front steps of the hotel and Charlotte Square beyond. The suite’s sitting room and bedroom are separated by a partial wall under a high ceiling. Of all the room’s brilliant décor, I liked the drawing of wily rabbits best — its outright whimsy juxtaposed nicely with the downy velvet drapes and refined upholstered sofa. The super king bed’s duvet was so nice — crisp, spotless, and had just the right weight. Snuggling under it while watching TV and reliving our day surrounded by a beautiful room full of beautiful things was wonderful and terribly romantic.
As I write this, I want to go back and package up the room to bring home and make ours, but I suppose the fantasy needs to stay in Edinburgh where it fits to tailor-made perfection.
The Kimpton Charlotte Square is a fantastic hotel in a city that falls in my top three world-wide. I particularly recommend the hotel to couples looking for a romantic getaway as it is the most romantic hotel in Edinburgh. Tip: For access to the best selection of room types and seasonal specials, book directly on Kimpton Charlotte Square’s official website.
It wasn’t until I caught sight of the building that I realised I had been a guest of the hotel before, years ago. At that time it had another name. I am delighted with the improvements Kimpton has made. I liked the hotel very much before, but it is even better now, particularly in the areas of interior design and cuisine. Kudos to Kimpton!
My gratitude to Naomi Cameron of 3x1 for expertly arranging my time at the hotel. Thank you, Naomi! You’re a credit to your company.

On my way out of Edinburgh I stopped for my final EB in the land of kilts, sporrans, and Harris Tweed. My suitcase was bulging with Scotch Whiskey miniatures, a framed picture of puffins, and a natty little hat that would absolutely suit the Canberra winter, but not the Scottish Summer.
I was catching the train from Edinburgh Station down to Guildford to see my Dad before flying home to Aussie. Being so close, six hours of trains, I couldn’t possibly pass up the chance to pop in. My train wasn’t until 11am, so PLENTY of time to feast first.
I had seen the menu in the window a few days before on one of my walks and decided it looked like the sort of place that would either do a really good EB or monumentally stuff it up by trying to be too innovative.
I was seated in a booth with a brass topped table, and green velvet seats which I sank into. Looking around, there was nary a hard chair in the joint. Even the wooden dining chairs had a plush cushion to rest the weary buttocks.
I ordered a latte, orange juice, and classic Eggs Benedict that included Ayrshire Smoked Bacon, Toasted Muffin, Poached Eggs, Hollandaise Sauce. The menu kept it simple, so I thought, it going to be plain and simple.
It wasn’t, of course it wasn’t. I was in the Grand Cafe. They had the date on either side of the name. 1905. The chandeliers sparkled. The stained glass was clean. The stairs marble.
It came on a hand-turned ceramic plate, with spotlessly clean, shiny, cutlery (flatware, for the Americans). Baby spinach and toasted onion flakes adorned as garnish. The sauce, while pale, WAS HOUSE MADE!
Hallelujah.
I’ll be honest. I devoured it. It looked appetising, smelled fabulous, and tasted tangy with lemon as the acid in the sauce. The eggs, which I forgot to photograph because I was too busy scoffing them, where cooked to perfection with golden yolks and no egg snot.
After I had eaten, I used a few drinks mats to write some tanka about my Edinburgh stay. A couple of days before I had bunked off the conference to go and see some wildlife in the wild.

When you walk the charming cobbled streets of Edinburgh’s Old Town, it’s easy to fall in love with the history. The gothic spires. The storytellers. The whiskey.
But beneath your feet lies another version of the city — one that most people don’t talk about unless they’re on a ghost tour.
One that’s still very much alive in its own way.
Welcome to the Edinburg Vaults, a network of stone chambers built in the late 1700s beneath South Bridge. They were meant for businesses and storage. But the vaults were dark, damp, and poorly ventilated — so they were quickly abandoned.
But not forgotten.
Soon after, the city’s poorest moved in. Families without homes, criminals, the sick, the unwanted.
People lived — and died — in these cold, airless rooms.
Disease spread quick. Murders went unnoticed.
And when the authorities eventually sealed the vaults, many believe they buried more than just stone and wood. They buried people alive.

Liberal Arts Blog — Friday is the Joy of Art, Architecture, Design, Film, and All Things Visual Day
Today’s Topic: Edinburgh: Raphael, “The Holy Family,” Velazquez “Old Lady Frying Eggs,” and Church “Niagara”
Last week, Vienna. Two weeks ago, Stockholm. Three weeks ago, Moscow. This week, Edinburgh — as we continue the tour of European art galleries to which I have never been. The first of today’s picks is from the Italian Renaissance, the second from the Spanish Golden Age, and the third from the Hudson River School of mid-19th century America. Experts — please chime in. Correct, elaborate, elucidate.
RAPHAEL (1483–1520) “The Holy Family with the Palm Tree” (1506)
1. What is most striking about this scene is the prominence of Joseph.
2. Most Holy Family scenes have a focus on Jesus or Mary.
3. Can any experts provide any enlightenment on this score?
NB: Raphael is most famous for “The School of Athens” — one of four frescoes in the “Stanza della Segnatura” in the Apostolic Museum in the Vatican in Rome. Tragically, he died young, allegedly from too much sex, on Good Friday, 1520, which was, according to Vasari, also his birthday.

DIEGO VELAZQUEZ (1599–1660) “Old Lady Frying Eggs” (1618) — “chiaroscuro” and photographic realism
1. The eggs look like fried eggs from a distance but if you look closely you will see that they are swimming in a liquid and are probably better described as poached.
2. Case study in “chiaroscuro” — “with a strong light source coming in from the left illuminating the woman, her utensils and the poaching eggs, while throwing the background and the boy standing to her right into deep shadow. Here the chiaroscuro is very intense, so much so that it would be impossible to see the wall at the bottom of the painting but for the basket hanging from it; it simultaneously manages to combine the murky darkness and high contrasts of light and shadow with the use of subtle hues and a palette dominated by ochres and browns. The composition is organized as an oval with the middle figures in the nearest plane, thus drawing in the viewer.”
3. “The realism is nearly photographic and shows everyday plates, cutlery, pans, pestles, jugs and mortars, capturing the special shine on a glass surface and the light’s play on the melon carried by the boy. The boiling pan is particularly well-captured, with its reflections and the whites of the eggs. Velázquez also worked particularly hard on the detail of the two figures’ hands.”
NB: Velazquez was the great painter of the second half of the “Spanish Golden Age” (the “Siglo de Oro”) under the reign of Philip IV (1605–1665). El Greco (1541–1641) — was the master of the first half under Philip II (1527–1598).

FREDERICK CHURCH (1826–1900) “Niagara Falls, from the American Side” (1867)
1. Church was a member of the “Hudson River School” of American artists. Their theme was “sublime” nature and the “awe” it inspires.
2. Nothing captures this theme better than Niagara Falls which became a metaphor for the “manifest destiny” of the United States.
3. This is Church’s largest painting (8 feet by 7 feet) and the only one of his paintings in a European collection.
NB: Church’s most influential rendering of Niagara (from the Canadian side) was painted ten years earlier. See second link below.

That the love of typewriters is a thing, becomes evident from Somsubhra Banerjee’s article that inspired this one. Such passion for outdated technology does not come naturally to me. Yet, I came to appreciate the charming appearance of typewritten verse in 2022 after my visit to Typewronger Books in Edinburgh, Scotland.
It was not love at first sight. I slowly descended the steps to an unpretentious-looking bookstore’s entrance. In true Harry Potteresque style that is so characteristic of Edinburgh, Scotland, the “entrance” gave away absolutely nothing. I might as well have opened what looked like a basement door and found myself in Diagon Alley on the other side!
Little did I know, that I would spend the next two hours with family rummaging through entertaining accounts written by independent writers, some graduates of the University of Edinburgh’s famous creative writing programs, and many other intriguing but unknown gems. Well, that shouldn’t be surprising in the world’s first city designated as a “City of Literature” by UNESCO.
It turns out that this bookstore specialises in selling, but also repairing old typewriters. That someone would take the pains to get an old dysfunctional typewriter repaired for a cost sounded absurd to me.
The book wizard at the front desk was kind enough to share snippets of how many writers still prefer to write on typewriters. Or how he has a typewriter there which when my daughter click-clacked, would generate a tweet! And, how he had sold metres and metres of books as “home office decoration” during the great golden age of Zoom (2020–22)!
What fascinated me the most, however, was how captivated I was with all the typewriters they had on display. Turquoise, mint green, plain white but also the classic grandfather typewriters — black with black keys and golden alphabets etched on them.
Since that rainy afternoon, seeing typewritten words on the paper now mesmerises me. Those stark black and white angular letters seem to have a personality of their own. Have you read verses of poetry that just feel more alive on Instagram because they are typewritten? There is magic in them. If I can now see it, could this be some kind of literary spiritual awakening I underwent at Typewronger?
Typewriters haven’t gone completely out of fashion despite their more sophisticated and user-friendly competitors such as laptops and tablets. Surprisingly, they have held on to their niche and achieved cult status. It makes me wonder if some part of our current less efficient, cumbersome, but infinitely more charming and deeper way of writing, will unexpectedly preserve itself despite the advent of easier, lazier AI tools. Anyway, I digress…
It makes me wonder why. Perhaps, a typewriter, the way it feels to exert your fingers on its keys and the resulting click-clack sound allows a writer to feel like a music composer. After all, music is just a more mystical form of writing, isn’t it?
Or does it allow her to take on the identity of Hemingway, or perhaps, Anne Lamott, as types away? Similar to the purpose a bottle of rum would serve, or perhaps, an old, white, soft-beyond-description t-shirt. Is it a getting-into-character exercise for literary minds? Or does it evoke nostalgia for a lost, golden era of literature that she painfully tries to access, but only through its relics — typewriters?
Who knows? Do tell me if you give writing on a typewriter a shot one fine day. And if you were to bust it, you now know where to get it repaired!

It is Festival season in Edinburgh. Tens of thousands of visitors have flocked in the city, from everywhere, many from abroad. The streets are crowded, buses cannot keep to their schedules, and most people react to the misery of long queues and delays cheerfully. I think there is the acceptance that if one wished to live in one of the most civilised cities in Europe, there must be a small price to pay. Coming out of the Assembly, where I had been to watch The Life and Times of Michael K, based on J.M.Coetzee’s novel, it was nearly 3.00 p.m. and I had not had lunch yet. So when I reached the bus stop just outside the Central Library, my heart sank when I saw a long queue waiting. I checked the electronic indicator, and was not surprised that it was not in operation, and therefore had no information about how long a wait there would be. An elderly lady, a sprightly nonagenarian, next to whom I found myself caught the little grimace I made, and nodded at me in sympathy, and I thought that to pass the time, one could indulge in a little conversation. You’ve been to a show, ma’am? I asked. Her eyes twinkled, as no doubt she too welcomed a chat to pass the time. No, she responded, but she was at the Usher Hall last night to catch that Korean orchestra playing Mozart. Was it good? I asked. It was superlative, she said, but had more to say.
‘I marvel at these people who are open to an alien culture and produce such excellent work,’ she said, ‘and ask myself, What do we know of Asian culture?’ Yes, I responded, the Koreans, like the Japanese and the Chinese, are excellent interpreters of Western classical music. Had I seen any good shows this year? She asked. I told her about Michael K, and added that I too had seen a delightful Korean opera, Trojan Woman, and said that it was one of the best shows that I had caught in the last few years.Yes, she said, they are a very cultured people. I then thought I should pay her a compliment.
‘I am surprised and pleased that you think so,’ I said.
‘But I was born in Penang,’ she blurted out, ‘my father was district officer in the thirties.’ And she told me that she had lived in Malaya until she was twelve, and then spent time in Jakarta as well. To my surprise she revealed that she used to be fluent in bahasa. My son was in Bogor for two or three years, I said, teaching TEFL. I had to add that my father too had spent time in Indonesia in the twenties.
Suddenly her eyes lit up again, and she said, ‘Oh I have to tell you this, it’s so marvellous.’ She had been shopping, and when it was time to pay, realised that she did not have her purse any more. She was upset and panicking, and to her amazement a young fellow came towards her brandishing her purse, which he had picked down the road. ‘Aren’t people marvellous?’ I had to tell her my own story of how, travelling from Lagos to Kontagora, a 15 hour journey I realised that I too had lost my purse.
‘I informed the driver, and he made an announcement, and someone stood up and walked towards me with my purse. Is it yours?’
‘So you must have travelled a fair bit too?’ I nodded, and told her that I came from Mauritius_’
That’s where the dodo came from?
The dodo and me, I added facetiously.
‘Oh,’ she asked suddenly, I know it’s a stupid question, but seeing you come from Mauritius, do you know dentist Chong Kwan? He used to be my dentist until last year when he sadly passed away.’ I had heard the name in Mauritius, and besides I remember my dentist brother talking about a dentist Chong Kwan. I figured out that her dentist Chong Kwan must have been the son of my brother’s colleague.
And I filled her in on what I had done since I came to the UK in 1959. Then a Number 27 bus appeared.
‘Now that I’ve been enjoying talking to you, I’d have been happy to wait some more,’ she said. Although I was quite hungry, I agreed with her.
‘Hope we can find seats together,’ she said, ‘because I’ve been enjoying our talk.’
Sadly, as the bus was fairly packed, she found a seat in front and I at the back. It seemed like an anti-climax, but two stops down her neighbour alighted, and I was able to move in with her. We continued together until Tollcross, where we both got out, she having decided to walk home, whilst I too tired to walk opted for another bus.
‘I’ll look out for you, and you do the same, we’re bound to meet again,’ she said cheerfully.

From Abuja to Edinburgh: my 1st semester experience as a Mastercard Foundation Scholar at the University of Edinburgh,https://medium.com/@mirabellemorah/from-abuja-to-edinburgh-my-1st-semester-experience-as-a-mastercard-foundation-scholar-at-the-80b3fc2ec550,"Sign up

This will humorously walk you through some of my experiences these past 3 months as a Scholar, from settling into Edinburgh to being blown away by heavy winds. See the end for scholarship application tips.
My first few weeks in the UK were both exciting and uneasy.
The Mastercard Foundation team at the University of Edinburgh have been incredible and helpful in everything. Once I got the scholarship, they guided me in applying to the university, gave travel guidance (before arriving) and helped me settle-in (on arrival).
Before I moved to start my postgrad, the past months were not easy. I experienced an armed robbery attack in the middle of the night (funny part in hindsight was that the first thing I hid was my passport). I went from that to being exhausted in the months that followed, to overthinking, etc. So arriving in Scotland, jumping into a new environment, new system and getting used to the pattern and methods of postgraduate lectures were not things I immediately settled into. It took two months for my beating heart to calm down. As they say, it’s not (only) the situation that makes you unhappy; your thoughts about it count.
I’ve explored several places in Scotland. We had a calming retreat at the Burn in Glenesk, Brechin. I visited the University of St. Andrews to watch a Rugby Match (both courtesy of Mastercard Foundation). Then I visited Glasgow to spend an evening with Gerry Higgins (Social Enterprise World Forum’s founder), his family, and Maeve Curtin.
Before Edinburgh (UK), I’d already visited circa 12/13 countries, but I’ve never been used to the transport systems of many places. So I’m slowly learning (because I walk to most of my destinations) to use Edinburgh’s public transportation, from trams to trains to buses.
As a Nigerian, you know all that hassle of looking for how to convert your naira to USD and how to buy stuff on Amazon or pay for some Apple subscription etc? Nah! That stuff is hectic abeg! It was a relief to get a multi-currency card in the UK that allowed me access different currencies. I could use a Revolut card to buy groceries in the UK with GBP and use it in the Netherlands to move around in EUR. Nice stuff.
An imaginary bank card I designed for “Bank of Womandla”. This was inspired by my course on Entrepreneurial Finance as well as one of my professors, Francis Green who encouraged us to imagine borrowing from “Bank of Francis” to fund our business ideas.
Using MTN? Remember to keep your MTN line. Here’s how.
You must find your own way of learning and dealing with course load. My postgraduate studies are on innovation and entrepreneurship, and before attending lectures and seminars, I need to read several papers. Some things that help me are to:
“This presentation was led by a fantastic first speaker who really nailed the presentation of the pitch. Ably supported by the second speaker, the pitch presentation was authoritative and slick. The video was really helpful in that it showed that attention had been given to how the pitch was to be presented…”
– Part of the academic feedback we received
Naturally, the Mastercard Scholars programme is already a HUGE community and network. The Foundation’s team organises several leadership lab sessions for scholars to learn. A Chevening scholar once attended an end-of-year event I co-organised with Kish (my fellow scholar representative) and said he liked the community we had amongst us. I’ve always believed in the power of mutually connecting with people beyond my studies, learning from others, sharing knowledge and strategically showing up for things.
So far:
I’ve been in the UK for 3 months. I haven’t seen snow in my part of Edinburgh (yet). The wind has tried to blow me away several times. I don’t know how to use a vending machine yet. I make better illustrations now. I’m better at making business valuations. And one of my favourite actions remains to keep asking more questions.
I am a huge advocate for rest. I budget heavy doses of rest and sleep in between all of my hard work. I believe in “less is more.” I believe in prayers and mindfulness. I believe in play, and in disconnecting to recharge.
P.S. for the title, no I didn’t live in Abuja. I flew out of Nigeria, from Abuja to Edinburgh.

Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, is very recognized, I would say, for its fascinating history and breathtaking architecture. It’s obviously also the perfect jumping-off point for seeing Scotland’s lovely scenery and cute towns. For anyone wanting to sneak away for a bit, there actually are a handful of cracking half day trips from Edinburgh where you can see Scotland’s highlights, so it’s almost effortless to squeeze them into your schedule. Whether you’re crazy about nature, into old stories, or very fancy seeing something a bit different, you, like your travel companions, might unearth just the thing not far from town. Let’s take a peep at, like, five ace half-day outings around Edinburgh!
Near Edinburgh, the Scottish Highlands are rather unmissable. You could grab a half-day tour, arguably offering spectacular sights featuring the mountains, lochs and valleys. This outing is truly grand, specifically for outdoorsy types and anyone needing some calm. A fair few tours drop you at spots I feel are well-known such as Loch Ness and Ben Nevis, basically to give you, like your travel partners, a glimpse of the magnificent countryside Scotland is so celebrated for.
Stirling Castle, not far from Edinburgh on the train, is so perfect for folk who find the olden days fascinating. It’s that sort of ancient fort providing views into the history of Scottish royalty because of its super well looked-after buildings and cool displays. You, like your family, could uncover the Wallace Monument, commemorating Scottish hero William Wallace, so nearby, too it’s almost too simple. Mixed together, these spots turn into an epic half-day adventure bubbling with Scottish tradition.
South Queensferry is likely just the ticket if scenic coasts grab you. Very nearby Edinburgh by car, this delightful village offers some grandstand seats looking at the Forth Bridge and the waterways dotted all around. Have a stroll on the waterfront, taste local fish at places to eat. You, like your friends, could possibly even hop on a boat for a peek at Inchcolm Island which, I guess, shows off a seriously good-condition abbey.
Another prime candidate for a half-day jolly around Edinburgh, so it seems, is the gorgeous Scottish Borders; Melrose Abbey, more precisely. This awesome ruin, built back in the 1100s, really brings home some fancy stonework coupled with some fascinating tales. Wrapped by gorgeous fields, the abbey seems grand for taking easy walks. You could perhaps peep around the amazing wee town of Melrose, known, I think, for its adorable shops and cafés.
You are likely to discover Linlithgow highly worthwhile! Loads of Scottish monarchs came into the world in its superb Linlithgow Palace, one of its claims to fame. A calming wander is made oh-so simple, very much because a lovely loch almost cuddles the palace. Loaded with stores and places to chow down, Linlithgow town alone gives a friendly spot to loosen up in, actually appreciating its character. Anyone landing here, should call in at Linlithgow railway station as Edinburgh is pretty handy that way.
Scotland’s pureness, past experiences, or culture might just show off what these first-rate half day trips from Edinburgh mean to those shy on spare time. Destinations have unique snapshots from inside Scotland that include the wonderful Highlands, or olden Stirling Castle or sweet-as-pie hamlets local to this great city. Bag-packing plus photos at the ready and it, it sounds just about time for people out of Edinburgh be discovering fantastic vistas.
Outdoor exploration hits a high through spring into summer; however changing leaf settings are extremely picturesque if seen over autumn-esque weather.
Most sites appear reachable thru public options like train travels, buses along with charted round travels. These may just come together well during quick timelines.
Quick excursions nearby could sum up as two locale stop offs throughout single half sun cycle of span in journey’s length; preferably narrow sights may have guests experience fullest joy thru focusing attention specifically one site tops!

Upon my first meal in Edinburgh, I noticed many cultural differences between the dining experience in the U.S. versus that in the U.K. We’re not talking about the food here, we’re talking about the overall atmosphere of a Scottish pub.
The dialect between Americans and Scots is very different. In both countries, the server’s job is to come up to the tables and ask if they can get you drinks or food yet, or if you need more time to decide what you’d like. At The Abbey Pub, I overheard a table with Scotts, and they had cut off the server’s spiel, by saying, “I know what I want.” In America, it would be considered rude to cut off someone’s sentence. We treat servers with more respect by waiting for them to finish speaking, then responding with, “We know what we would like!” or “I think we are ready.”
The second difference in dining etiquette is the volume at which you speak. While restaurants can be loud in America, typically, all the tables’ voices mesh and it’s just overall chatter. In a Scottish pub, some tables are quiet, and some that the Scotts are speaking very loudly, and using very intense language.
(Photo sourced from Tripadvisor.com).
In The Abbey, there was a table near us of what appeared to be four Scotts or two couples. The women…

I was in the amazing Edinburgh Royal Botanic Gardens in April admiring the newly emerging spring daffodils when I had an epiphany, trees do in fact go to heaven, who knew!
A proponent of the daffodil is the end of life charity, Marie Curie who adopted it as their logo in 1986 offering hope, courage and support to all those who are touched by them. They started life delivering radiotherapy to women in the 30s.
She wore her yellow sun-bonnet,
She wore her greenest gown;
She turned to the south wind
And curtsied up and down.
She turned to the sunlight
And shook her yellow head,
And whispered to her neighbour:
“Winter is dead.”
Daffodowndilly, a poem by A.A. Milne
The first yellow daffodils of spring are a precious time of year for me. As A.A. Milne rightly points out they signify the end of a cold, black and white winter, a chance to wave goodbye to bad weather and offer a sense of timely rebirth with hope and a new beginning for the upcoming year.
Their arrival, a perennial gift from nature with their much-needed boost of colour is all I need from a faith, a non-spiritual conviction for me that never seems to disappoint, yellow on yellow, year on year and with impeccable timing! An unlikely yellow antidote to death, dying and goodbye!
The plant’s ‘bulbus’ (Latin) has a layer of dried skin, which serves as protection, and helps ensure that the bulb remain moist and properly insulated. There’s also another important function that it serves. Not only does this layer serve as a defence for this year’s plant, but it also carries the embryo for the plant or flower that’s going to bloom the following year.
Understanding that different kinds of daffodils follow their own pace is important. Growth primarily depends on the temperature of the soil as well as the amount of daylight that the plant receives and therefore the length of the day. Up here in Scotland we wait a month or more longer than in London where I grew up, for their arrival.
In the northern hemisphere they flower in spring and down in the southern hemisphere in our autumn, their spring. It’s magical stuff!
The daffodil plant generally thrives when the temperatures in the soil are between 50/60 degrees. As the sun begins to spend more time in the sky and the days begin to lengthen, the plant starts to grow more quickly.
Brodie Castle on the Moray Firth is one of the best places to see daffodils. They have a world-famous collection of well over 300 varieties and these always flower very late and are often at their best in late April and early May. I always enjoy a trip over to Brodie, located between Forres and Nairn just to see this yellow carnival at one of the National Trust for Scotland’s best kept secrets. Some varieties are around 150 years old like my favourite one above.
Another amazing display of yellow occurs around the same time, although with climate change it does flower from time to time all year-round, is from gorse.
Otherwise known as Whin and Furse and also Fuzzy Bush it starts its major flowering in late March and April and lasts here well into June. The overt coconut smell when in full bloom on a warm day is a very recognisable scent, one that you can also cook with if you flavour a dish with the flower petals.
It really is a ubiquitous, invasive plant in Northern Scotland especially by the coast and according to BBC’s Spring Watch; whom I tweeted this question last year, it flowers at odd times all year round simply to benefit from any early pollinators that are hanging around, out of season, who knew?
It also importantly has its own flower fairy:
When gorse is out of blossom,
(Its prickles bare of gold)
‘Then kissing’s out of fashion’,
Said country-folk of old.
Now Gorse is in its glory
In May when skies are blue,
But when its time is over,
Whatever shall we do?
O dreary would the world be,
With everyone grown cold —
Forlorn as prickly bushes
Without their fairy gold!
But this will never happen:
At every time of year
You’ll find one bit of blossom —
A kiss from someone dear!
The ‘Gorse Fairy’ is one of Cicely Mary Barker’s flower fairies that were first published in 1923.There are 170 original and individually accurate botanic illustrations, coupled with charming fairy images based on real children from Cicely’s sister’s nursery school. Each one also has a unique poem attached as above. The picture shown is on my wall at home, the verse in my book!
If you play golf on any of the world-famous links courses here, the ones played by the sea on the sand dunes and your ball lands in a gorse bush, you will have another, unmentionable name for this plant. As a rule of thumb and one which sadly missed gold commentator Peter Allis once advised, if you actually find it, take it out, drop it under penalty and ‘take your punishment son’. Never try to play it, you will regret it!
As with the daffodils, how these plants work out when to flower, never ceases to amaze me. Other yellow spring coastal gifts here are bird-foot trefoil, broom (often confused with gorse but safer!), aconites and the common dandelion.
The after-life of a tree
While once again in the Edinburgh Botanic Garden I also came across the following sign explaining how old trees that die do in fact have an ‘after-life’ or go to ‘tree heaven’ if you like. This very old sweet chestnut started to die back a few years ago and so the plant undertakers at Inverleith cut it down and left some of the main trunk in situ and the large boughs on the ground providing a habitat for other life such as bats, insects and birds.
However, this tree has suddenly lifted the lid on its coffin and surprisingly this spring, some new shoots and leaves have appeared. You can’t it seems keep a good tree down and yet another great example of nature providing hope and rebirth for the future despite looking death full in the face.
A.A. Milne — Writer and Poet
Alan Alexander Milne (1882 –1956) was a British author, poet, and playwright best known for his books about the bear Winnie-the-Pooh along with Christopher Robin, Tigger, Piglet and others. Christopher Robin was actually his son and who after a trip to the Zoo in London Milne wrote the original Winnie the Pooh story based on a tame bear, that they saw there named Winnipeg.
Milne was primarily a playwright before the massive success of Winnie-the-Pooh largely overshadowed all his previous work. Milne served in both World Wars, as a lieutenant in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment in the First World War and as a captain in the Home Guard in the Second World War. despite being a pacifist. He oddly had a degree in Maths whereby Trinity College, Cambridge, was his alma mater and was a useful cricketer. He bequeathed his original Pooh writings to the college.
Based on the fact that many of Milne’s philosophical sayings, poems and Winnie-the-Pooh quotes are often recited at funerals which I’ll come to later, he too saw the arrival of daffodils as a new beginning as per his poem at the start of this blog, added to the fact he was overtly a pacifist it seems that he did not speak out much on the subject of religion at all.
He did however, use religious terms to explain his decision, while remaining a pacifist, to join the Home Guard: ‘In fighting Hitler we are truly fighting the Devil, the Anti-Christ … Hitler was a crusader against God’
His best-known comment on the subject was remembered on his death:
The Old Testament is responsible for more atheism, agnosticism, disbelief — call it what you will — than any book ever written; it has emptied more churches than all the counter-attractions of cinema, motor bicycle and golf course.
He also wrote in the poem ‘Explained’:
Elizabeth Ann
Said to her Nan:
Please will you tell me how God began?
Somebody must have made Him.
So who could it be, ‘cos I want to know?
So, it seems that Milne was probably agnostic and veering on a non-believer but one who following a pretty religious upbringing in the late nineteenth century found it hard to completely let go as it was in those days and explaining that out loud, even harder.
It’s still difficult for me to tell my mother that I am an atheist and have been for many years following a similar childhood, where she is quite in disbelief and overtly saddened by my views.
Anyway, this blog is about the rebirth that nature brings us each year and one that is quite independent of any otherworldly beliefs and one that the ‘Scottish Enlightenment’ here began to address in the mid-eighteenth century questioning religion and allowing freedom of debate on subjects such as art, politics, science, medicine, engineering and especially philosophy that was, in those days difficult to contemplate in public.
That blog is here if you want to read it: Money can’t buy love, as the Beatles once suggested but it can buy a better death. However, contemplating ‘assisted-dying’ might well become part of a new ‘Scottish Enlightenment’ very soon!
https://medium.com/@DuncanHynd/money-cant-buy-love-as-the-beatles-once-suggested-but-it-can-buy-a-better-death-202150c6d2db
So yes, I definitely do firmly believe in yellow these days!
However, with a nod to the divine, it seems that Hindus see yellow as the colour of knowledge and learning. Lord Vishnu’s dress is yellow symbolizing his representation of knowledge.
Lord Krishna and Ganesha also wear yellow dresses while both Christians and Hindus associate yellow, seen as the colour of fire with renewal and purity and so while not the same, seemingly not a million miles away from my amateur philosophy above!
Winnie-the-Pooh
Milne’s bear was so much more than the famous animated hero of our childhoods and one that many Disney cartoons later featured. He and his friends were very much into philosophy with Milne using the characters to express many of his own beliefs. You probably wouldn’t have thought about using Pooh bear to find quotes about death, dying or saying goodbye to someone you love and so I have selected a few here that are in line with this article, secular in nature.
Death:
‘If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day, so I never have to live without you.’
‘If ever there is tomorrow when we’re not together, there is something you must always remember. You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think. But the most important thing is, even if we’re apart… I’ll always be with you.’
‘Wherever they go, and whatever happens to them on the way, in that enchanted place on the top of the forest, a little boy and his bear will always be playing.’
‘I used to believe in forever, but forever’s too good to be true.’
Life:
‘Some people care too much. I think it’s called love.’
‘How do you spell love?’ said Piglet, ‘You don’t spell it, you feel it, said Pooh
‘Rivers know this, there is no hurry. We shall get there some day.’
‘Sometimes,’ said Pooh, ‘the smallest things take up the most room in your heart’
Goodbye:
‘How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.’
‘But, of course, it isn’t really good-bye, because the forest will always be there… and anybody who is friendly with bears can find it.’
Airbnb offers a new feature when booking holidays, one where a death has occurred of a famous person at some time in the past!
In his writing prime, A.A. Milne lived at Cotchford Farm in Hartfield, East Sussex, the house, gardens and surrounding woods and country side inspired his children’s books. However, it is now available as a holiday let on Airbnb, but that is not the whole story!
The large country house has gained notoriety as it was also the home of Rolling Stones original member Brian Jones, who was found dead in the outdoor swimming pool in 1969, his death officially recorded as ‘misadventure’.
Around the grounds it is said that there are statues of the main characters in Milne’s books and poems, including Christopher Robin, Owl and an old sundial with images of Piglet, Tigger and Roo that also features words such as, ‘This warm, sunny spot belongs to Pooh, and here he wonders what it’s time to do’.
The Airbnb listing stated that you can ‘stay in the former home of A.A. Milne, Christopher Robin and Winnie The Pooh’ while mentioning that the property was a welcoming family home and historic building while Brian Jones was among other owners since the Milne family had it.
Some pictures located in the house have seemingly documented the chaos associated with the finding of Jones’s body in the pool and others showed Jones standing with the statues. It also seems that Christopher Robin, was not a great fan of being included in his father’s books and they sadly went their separate ways before Milne died there in 1956. An ill-fated property perhaps?
The Marie Curie charity began by delivering radiotherapy to women in 1930, who knew! They use the daffodil as the icon for their amazing end of lifecare charity for a reason.
This charity is the leading one in the UK that deals with dying, death and goodbye but it had roots in a subject close to my heart.
The Marie Curie charity really started life at the Marie Curie Hospital in Hampstead, London in 1930 where the ‘radiological treatment of women suffering from cancer and allied diseases’ was undertaken in what was a very early, specialist radiotherapy centre. Staffed only by women it had facilities for both radium and x-ray therapy with in and out-patient facilities. Amazingly in 1944, most of the hospital was razed to the ground in the blitz whereby their radium radioactive sources, safely stored in steel containers took, it seems three weeks to find in the rubble, probably much to the relief of the local RPA, if indeed they had one in those days!
In 1948 the rebuilt hospital parted ways from the newly born NHS, which Bevan had famously described as a ‘great and novel undertaking’ so that the name of Marie Curie could be established in the charitable medical field. Known initially as the ‘Marie Curie International Memorial Foundation’ it primarily investigated the needs of cancer patients and the best ways of helping them.
The first Marie Curie Home for cancer patients was opened in 1952, based in an old National Trust property in Fife while during the 1950s and early 1960s, the charity opened a further nine Marie Curie Homes in specially adapted but old buildings all over the UK while the charity’s main remit was to help cancer patients who needed nursing directly at home. Another aim was to make a substantial contribution to cancer research, especially into its causes and treatments.
From the 1960s onwards all Marie Curie Homes would be specially designed and newly built. The first was opened in Belfast in 1965. A similar, larger building followed in Edinburgh in 1966.
Their 24/7, day and night nursing service for cancer patients continued to grow throughout the 1960s while further specialist, dedicated laboratories opened for cancer research work.
From the early 1980s, ‘Marie Curie Homes’ and later the newly named ‘Marie Curie Hospices’ moved away from providing long-term nursing care to cancer patients, and became increasingly focused on hospice care, a field that they are now renowned for world-wide with the ability to offer palliative care for more patients, who were more seriously ill and usually for shorter periods of time.
The link to daffodils began in Scotland in 1986 in what was termed their first ‘daffodil appeal’ using live daffodils as a hand out similar to the poppy appeal. This continued to grow throughout the 1990s when they incorporated the daffodil into their logo, where it remains today.
They developed innovative fundraising partnerships with major companies and opened their first high street charity shops while in 1995, the Marie Curie Memorial Foundation became Marie Curie Cancer Care.
They launched their first national campaign called ‘supporting the choice to die at home’ and diversified to allow for the treatment of all terminal illnesses and not a charity just aimed at cancer patients. They successfully helped more terminally ill people remain in their homes, reducing the need for emergency hospital treatment, allowing more people to die at home and saving the NHS money.
Research efforts were focused on finding better ways of caring for terminally ill people and their families through palliative care research programs while establishing a major grants programme, awarding around £1 million every year to fund palliative care research projects, on a competitive basis becoming one of the UK’s leading funders of palliative care research.
In October 2014, the name was reduced to simply ‘Marie Curie’, to reflect the work to support people affected by all terminal illnesses.
Their main focus today is to assist people to make the right plans and preparations and to find the information and support they need when confronted with dying themselves or for family and friends facing bereavement. This includes prioritising social inclusion as some communities they have discovered get disproportionately less support than others at the end of life.
The Marie Curie Policy
‘We’re determined to fight for a world where everyone gets the best experience they possibly can at the end of their lives’.
Their ‘Better end of life’ report is here if you want to find out more on this amazing charity:
https://www.mariecurie.org.uk/policy/better-end-of-life-2022
And then the swallows return, the bluebells come out and we move on again!
PS. I wanted to add a section on music, an important part of my own life and am aware of the use of yellow in a few well-known hits, The Beatles and Coldplay come to mind. However, just as I write this latest piece, UK rapper ‘Big Zuu’ who also doubles as a brilliant ‘pop-up’ celebrity chef on TV has released his new song, its’ simply called Yellow! It’s great, shows off his musical talent in a different light and so I simply had to include it!

Hello from the world I’m embroiled in, where I’m way deeper than knee-deep in developing a new long-term unrestricted £15m pooled fund that shifts power to local people to make decisions on a cohort of community orgs in Edinburgh to lead place-based systems change across some big themes - poverty, racial inequality and injustice and climate change (phew — and yes I do have a bad habit of long sentences!).
Last week I wrote an update and thanks to our amazing learning groups as we come to the end of this chapter of co-design. I also have shared this with a group of people who have been advising, following along, supporting and cheering on.
Reminder that our learning groups have been a mix of individuals via End Poverty Edinburgh, community organisations, and funders and public sector partners — if you’d like to read more here is a blog that talks about this.
After I sent that I thought… I have an almost ready-made blog here.
So here is the (slightly edited) April 2024 update on Regenerative Futures Fund:
From March 2024 we have moved into a new phase of the project which means bringing the learning groups as they have been since the late 2022 / early 2023, to a close.
In March 2024 we created a condensed version of the detailed operational plan, which can be accessed here on the EVOC website.
We are also hoping to do an open Q&A session for community organisations in Edinburgh soon.
A few updates (and thanks!):
As ever, keen to chat with anyone who would like to meet to talk any aspect through, you’d like to get involved. Amazingly, there is SO much more to share than what’s in this update (I’ve missed so many things, it probably needs another blog!) — but I’m always to happy to chat over anything here and missing bits.
An information / conversation session coming soon — for Edinburgh community orgs.
And our ‘funders progressing proposals’ group has been meeting regularly since January if anyone from funding orgs would like to know more about that in terms of joining as a funding partner by contributing to the pooled fund.
Phew!
Finally — In 2023 I set myself a challenge to do 42 swims in my 42nd year and happy to report I am on track although I will be in the sea 4 times between now and next Saturday! Happy to have achieved a wee personal goal alongside a busy work year, and look forward to more swims in my 43rd year and beyond. Here is a pic of my favourite local swimming spot in early April ❤️
Please do email me on leah.black@evoc.org.uk or find me on LinkedIn (that’s where things seem to be happening now) if you’d like to chat 😁

3/4/2024
As decentralization becomes a central theme within the blockchain community, there’s an increasing recognition of the need to systematically evaluate the levels of decentralization within blockchain networks. In response to this need, the University of Edinburgh has spearheaded the creation of the Edinburgh Decentralization Index (EDI). This initiative aims to provide a detailed and open-source framework for evaluating blockchain networks, highlighting the industry’s shift towards distributed ecosystems and emphasizing the critical need for transparency and standardization in blockchain assessments.
On March 1st, 2024, the unveiling of the EDI Dashboard’s alpha version represented a significant step forward in blockchain transparency. Spearheaded by the University of Edinburgh and funded by a grant from Input Output Global (IOG), this open-source index was a result of a collaborative effort with multiple universities. By pooling their diverse academic insights and technical expertise, the partnership aimed to ensure the tool’s relevance and adaptability across different blockchain contexts.
The Decentralization Index is crafted to be objective and unbiased, with the aim of developing into an industry-wide accepted benchmark for assessing decentralization as it progresses over time.
The Edinburgh Decentralization Index (EDI) employs a variety of metrics to evaluate the decentralization levels of Layer 1 blockchains, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, Ethereum, Litecoin, Tezos, and Zcash. Understanding these metrics can help stakeholders assess the robustness and fairness of different blockchain networks.
Nakamoto Coefficient: This metric indicates the minimum number of entities required to control over 50% of mining or staking power, thus highlighting potential vulnerabilities in the network’s decentralization. A higher Nakamoto Coefficient suggests a more resilient and distributed network, making it a crucial measure for assessing security against collusion or attacks.
Gini Coefficient: By measuring the inequality within the distribution of block production, the Gini coefficient helps identify the balance of power within the network. A lower Gini coefficient indicates a more equitable distribution, which is essential for ensuring that no single entity has disproportionate control or influence over the network.
Shannon Entropy: This measure of information entropy quantifies the unpredictability and diversity of block producers. Higher Shannon entropy suggests a more decentralized network, reflecting a varied and unpredictable block production that enhances network security and fairness.
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI): The HHI measures market concentration to evaluate the diversity of block producers. Low HHI values denote a decentralized network with a balanced distribution of power among participants, which is vital for preventing dominance by any single entity.
Theil Index: This index measures the redundancy in a population, with lower values indicating a more equal distribution of block production. By assessing the diversity of participation in the network, the Theil index provides insights into the network’s decentralization and operational fairness.
Max Power Ratio: Representing the proportion of blocks produced by the most dominant entity, this metric sheds light on the extent of control exerted by the largest block producer. A lower max power ratio is preferable for a healthy, decentralized ecosystem, ensuring no single participant overly influences the network.
Tau-Decentralization Index: This index measures the concentration of power by identifying the minimum number of entities controlling more than a specific fraction (e.g., 66%) of mining or staking power. It offers a nuanced view of network control, essential for understanding deeper layers of decentralization beyond the majority control.
These metrics collectively offer a multi-dimensional view of blockchain decentralization, providing valuable insights for users, developers, and regulators to understand and improve the distributed ecosystems of various blockchains.
The Edinburgh Decentralization Index (EDI) aims to reshape the blockchain landscape by providing a standardized approach to evaluating decentralization. This could significantly impact the future of blockchain technology, potentially paving the way for widespread adoption. As businesses, institutions, and nation-states begin utilizing blockchains for various purposes like identity management, payment systems, and governance, it could lead to increased adoption of blockchain technologies across both public and private sectors. This, in turn, would drive innovation and enhance efficiency.
By offering clear metrics for decentralization, the EDI facilitates more informed decisions by governments and organizations. For instance, a country might choose to adopt a blockchain like Cardano for its stablecoin initiative. Such applications could enhance public trust in blockchain and stimulate broader usage across various sectors.
Furthermore, with the EDI placing decentralization at the forefront, current and future blockchain systems are likely to be encouraged to become more decentralized and incorporate features such as on-chain governance. This emphasis on decentralization could lead to increased adoption of blockchain technologies for both public and private applications, thereby driving innovation and efficiency.
As the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry focuses more on decentralization in the future, the development of the Edinburgh Decentralization Index (EDI) by the University of Edinburgh will play a crucial role and lay the foundation for future metrics by which blockchains are measured. Moving forward, with the EDI emphasizing decentralization, it will be poised to encourage the adoption of more decentralized approaches within blockchain systems, fostering innovation and efficiency across both public and private applications.

A week’s adventure loop from Edinburgh
Venturing out on a cycle tour in August 2020 as Scotland gradually emerges from the coronavirus lockdown was a complicated decision, fraught with factors we’d never had to consider on bicycle trips before. First the question of whether we should even leave home for a week, and add our needs for accommodation, food, and facilities to the burden placed on other towns. Then, whether we could manage proper handwashing and social distancing from the saddle. And not least, if we were to encounter any injuries or difficulties along the way, could we manage that ourselves without putting others at risk?
The choice to travel during a pandemic is an individual one, based on personal circumstances, capacities, and acceptance of risk. We were certain we didn’t want to board a train or a plane unnecessarily, but a self-supported bicycle camping trip seemed a reasonable form of recreation, and although we planned to be away for a week we were never more than 60 miles away from home in case we needed to return quickly. We packed our face coverings, hand sanitiser, puncture repair tools, and first-aid kit; counted ourselves extremely fortunate to be in good health with time off from work; and hit the road.
Day 1 encompassed 40 miles from Edinburgh down to Innerleithen, following the brilliant National Cycle Network Route 1 along traffic-free paths and quiet roads out of the city, over the Moorfoot Hills and down into a beautiful valley beside the Leithen Water. It was a hot, pre-thunderstorm day and our legs were decidedly unused to hills after being inside for months, but it was still a joyful experience to finally be released from the cramped confines of the city and be flying along on two wheels.
In Innerleithen we visited with friends, and the next morning had a lovely breakfast outdoors at the Café Sitooterie.
Notes on the route: brilliant off-road cycle paths (converted from former railway lines so mostly flat) all the way from Edinburgh to Bonnyrigg. From Bonnyrigg the route is on-road on minor B roads with little traffic. No villages or services for 20 miles until Innerleithen; we picked up sandwiches and snacks at the Bonnyrigg Co-op.
Day 2 took us from Innerleithen down to the Ruberslaw Wild Woods Camping site a few miles from Denholm. We followed NCN Route 1 along a gorgeous riverside path and through quiet woods, rolling up and down hills to Melrose. Melrose is a lovely town with an historic Abbey (one of the stops on the Four Abbeys local cycle loop) but it was closed under coronavirus restrictions. The town itself was quite busy so we stopped at another Co-op to buy some bagels and peanut butter (by now our classic bike touring lunch menu) along with groceries for a camp dinner, and had a picnic in Gibson Park.
Notes on the route: between Caddonfoot and Tweedbank the NCN slips off the road and down a tiny dirt path next to the river, well-hidden by trees and bushes. We missed the sign and instead turned right across a newly-surfaced cycling and pedestrian bridge — which was fabulous infrastructure, even if it was the wrong direction (for us). Although NCN 1 follows the river most of the way to Newtown St Boswells, it’s not flat; we tackled about 1,000 feet of elevation gain including a good climb out of Melrose.
From Melrose we cycled on to Newtown St Boswells, where we had to leave the NCN and scout our own route south to Denholm. Navigation was a bit tricky since many of the minor roads were unsigned, but we wound our way through the countryside and arrived at the campsite around 6:30pm. We’d been lucky to get a booking in advance, since so many campsites are fully booked for weeks due to high demand. Ruberslaw is a well-run and pretty fancy campsite, with a central Hub with showers, phone charging and Wifi, and a shared open-air kitchen with a microwave and electric tea kettle! We’d opted to camp in one of their forest pitches, so after checking in we had to hike-a-bike up a grassy farm track to our spot in the woods.
Day 3 was a “rest” day. We were staying a second night at Ruberslaw but had to change sites since we hadn’t been able to book two nights in one spot. So we packed up camp and carried our gear with us 8 miles to Hawick (pronounced “Hoyk”) which was the closest town with a grocery store. As always seems to be the case, avoiding the main roads usually at least doubles the climbing, so it turned out to be a fairly strenuous “rest day” ride. In Hawick we had lunch outside at the Damascus Drum cafe and picked up some food to cook in camp before cycling 8 miles back (this time on a flatter route).
Day 4 brought 1,200 feet of elevation gain on foot, and another 1,600 feet on bikes. We spent the morning climbing Ruberslaw itself (“law” being a common word in Scotland for a hill, from the Anglo-Saxon word hlāw). The thunderstorms had finally broken overnight, so we left our wet tent to dry out a bit and hiked through the mist and purple heather up to the summit.
We left camp around 12pm and cycled on minor roads through Jedburgh up to Kelso. The rain caught up with us as we arrived in Kelso, notable for having a cobbled square with all cobbled roads leading into it —this is quite the experience on bikes (I call it the Cobble Wobble). All the cafes were closed and we were contemplating soggy takeaway sandwiches from Greggs until we happened to spot a nearby pub with a covered outdoor picnic table and made a dash for that just as the clouds burst open again. We tucked ourselves and our bikes under the awning and had an excellent lunch. (The name of the pub was, of course, The Cobbles — highly recommended).
We waited out the rain as long as we could then left Kelso looking for NCN Route 1 again (we missed the turn, but our alternate route on the back roads through Stichill and Leitholm was virtually traffic-free and mostly flat). The rain came down hard again for about 5 minutes, which was plenty of time to get us thoroughly drenched, even in our waterproof gear. Luckily we had 14 miles to dry out before we reached Swinton. We stayed overnight with some kind and covid-conscious Airbnb hosts who let us dry out our tent in their airing cupboard.
Notes on the route: after Jedburgh we turned north on the B6400 towards the tiny hamlet of Nisbet and then followed the Borders Abbeys Way for awhile. The section of the Borders Abbeys Way east from Nisbet is a rocky gravel track; for a paved road option go a bit further along the B6400 and take the next right.
Day 5, heading for the seaside! It was a short 17-mile ride from Swinton to Berwick-upon-Tweed in sunny weather. We cycled over the River Tweed and crossed the border from Scotland into England, then rejoined NCN 1 in Norham. We took a brief break in the shade and had a look round the Norham Castle ruins, then carried on, crossing over the 200-year-old Union Chain suspension bridge and following a separated cycle track briefly alongside the A1, then a bridleway over the hill into Berwick.
We set up camp at the Seaview Caravan Park on the outskirts of Berwick, and spent the rest of the sunny afternoon on the beach. (The Caravan Park was ok, not much accommodation for tents other than a small patch of lawn alongside the road, but lovely views and good facilities for toilets, showers, and washing-up sinks.)
Day 6, so long, sunshine. A thick fog rolled in overnight and beclouded the whole coast. We had a second night booked at the Caravan Park and had planned a day ride out and back to Lindisfarne National Nature Reserve and Holy Island, about 15 miles down the coast. Holy Island is connected to the mainland by a tidal causeway which is flooded by the sea twice a day, but the safe crossing window that day was between 12:10pm — 9:20pm so we had plenty of time. We followed NCN 1 all the way, which is a fantastic adventure over grassy clifftop paths (unpaved for most of the route). We were quite glad not to be hauling heavy panniers but met a few loaded touring cyclists who seemed to be having a great time. We intended to stop at the lone Londis shop near Beal for provisions, but instead came across the Barn at Beal Restaurant & Campsite so had coffee and very good sandwiches there instead.
Day 7 turned out to be our longest distance day, cycling 50 miles from Berwick-upon-Tweed to Yellowcraig Beach. We had takeaway breakfast rolls and coffee from the Mule on Rouge Cafe in Berwick, picked up some bread and cheese for lunch on the road, and cycled out on NCN 1, connecting to NCN 76 as we left town. NCN 76 was our route for most of the day; we left it briefly at Foulden to head inland and skipped the scenic loop to Eyemouth (saving those miles and hills for another day). We had lunch on the side of the road, picked wild blackberries, and rolled through the lovely town of Dunbar and then into North Berwick (not to be confused with Berwick-upon-Tweed).
Notes on the route: NCN 76 is mostly on-road, using quiet minor roads but with a 5-mile stretch on the A1107 from near Reston to Cocksburnpath. It’s a fast road but there weren’t many cars and drivers gave us plenty of space. After Bilsdean there’s a separated cycle way next to the A1 (crossing the A1 is required at one point, at a guided crossing) which takes you past Torness Nuclear Power Station. Not long after it’s a traffic-free path into Dunbar, and then it’s mostly on the John Muir Way (a mix of quiet roads, traffic-free paths, and grassy tracks) into North Berwick and on to Yellowcraig Beach.
After a short break in North Berwick we pedalled another 3 miles on to Yellowcraig Beach to wild camp for the night. There was a handful of other tents spaced out across the dunes when we arrived, and signs permitting responsible camping, so we waved hello to our distant camping neighbours, pitched our tent, and made macaroni cheese on the beach.
Day 8 was a straightforward journey from Yellowcraig Beach back home to Edinburgh, following a familiar route on the NCN 76. Glad to be back safely, and grateful for the dedicated folk at Sustrans who have built the fantastic National Cycle Network for everyone to travel along.
Total distance and elevation gain: 232 miles, 9,875 feet

During 2022 summer, I participated in a summer programme — student-led, individually-created course — in the University of Edinburgh. What this course about is students themselves design the course that they plan to study and use reflective framework to develop personal and professional skills throughout their learning process.
It is a good way to learn knowledge or skills outside of one’s major and with the guidance from the university, students are able to individually conduct reflective report regarding their study path — a meaningful assessment method on what students have learnt.
When I think about what I want to learn during the summer, a question popped out: what else can I create with the background of studying psychology?
It turns out that User Experience (UX) Design is an area connect tightly to psychology as it involves knowing users and solving their problems. Therefore, I decided to learn in more details how a UX designer conduct a project and what skills are required along the way.
The project that I choose to carry on is to solve a problem that I accidentally saw in the newspaper in which it talks about Nigeria’s stock market may need more than technology to thrive. Therefore, with the hope to have an accessible app for people with little investment knowledge to use, I decided to design an iOS app that can make users find it more easily to invest stocks online.
Project Showcase:
To have the prototypes like the picture showed above, I need to acquire several skills:
This programme requires two reflective reports to be submitted as a way of assessing students’ ability to self-trace what has been doing well and what can be improved.
To achieve a distinct grade, reports should show the writers’ reflection framework when reviewing their study processes. In particular, students’ critical reflection is important as it can shows that they are not only paying attention to what goes well but also taking into account areas that can be improved. For example, though I noticed that my learning process of using Figma is efficient in terms of time-management, the way I learn only relies on having my project done. If there is more self-exploration when learning to use Figma, my learning pathway can be more diverse.
Although in most of the time, this programme test people’s ability to self-study, each student is assigned to a tutor who will provide advice with how to improve their reflective ability.
Finally, I got an A with all the assessment being reviewed by my tutors. What this programme is about is not only the mark that I got, but truly teaches me the importance of learning process rather than the outcome.
Before enrolled in this programme, I rarely thought about what I want to do as my career. Although I am glad to being able to learn Psychology, there are so much choices that I can make to further my career.
With this programme experience, I decided to learn the UX design further and hope to being able to produce more projects that are useful for the real-world. Although I am lack of certain design skills, I believe this story told me that when one person decided to be the teacher and teach himself/herself, the power of learning is unbelievable.

on Edinburgh’s Royal Mile
St Giles High Kirkis celebrating its 900th birthday in style by getting some marvellous new lights installed. This really does cement its place on the Edinburgh skyline as the finest spire or sticky up bit (SOSUB) and I’d be prepared to roll up my sleeves and go bareknuckle with anyone who disagrees.
This long view shows the SOSUBS of (left to right) Edinburgh Castle, The Hub spire, then (in the background) the Scottish National War Memorial at the castle, St Giles crown spire, and The Tron Kirk spire.
You’re basically looking at a compressed Royal Mile squished into one frame with a 500mm lens.
The view from the street is pretty impressive too, especially when the haar rolls in from the North Sea and the beams of light continue into the sky. If only St Giles could work out a way to get £1 from everyone who takes a photo of the spire from the Royal Mile they could pay the leccy bill and a whole lot more.

I am, at heart, a homebody and perhaps that is why part of me is forever shocked I don’t live in my birth city. It’s especially dumbfounding given just how sensational Edinburgh, Scotland is as an abode: knock it out the park architecture everywhere the eye can see; it’s a manageable size (everything is basically ten minutes away from everything else); it is a place of international significance, historically (the birthplace of the Age of Enlightenment) and now (the city’s population doubles in size every August for its miscellany of festivals (International, Fringe, Book, Jazz)).
I left Edinburgh for the first time in 2000, aged seventeen to go to university (destination: Oxford) and returned in 2003, only to leave it again in 2012, aged twenty-eight (destination: London) hoping to leave behind my broken-heart and to kickstart my life as a blindsided singleton.
Plenty of people leave cities in those sorts of circumstances, but in the case of the 2012 departure, I do rather regret doing so, for it gave rise to a prolonged, complex grief from which I sometimes doubt I have yet fully recovered.
At the time, it felt like the whole city had been contaminated by a betrayal I had experienced at the hands of a boy I thought…

Edinburgh Festivals 2015 Impact Study
Quality of events and record numbers drive the world’s Festival City
Earlier this week, Festivals Edinburgh and BOP released the findings for the 2015 Festivals Edinburgh Impact Report. With the help of more than 30,000 survey respondents, our report quantifies the economic, social and cultural impact of the twelve Edinburgh Festivals represented by Festivals Edinburgh. The report confirms the significant contribution that Edinburgh Festivals make to the quality of life, international reputation and economic strength of Edinburgh and Scotland.
Key findings from our study show that:
The study takes a holistic approach to assessing impact that considers social, cultural and economic effects. This approach of assessing the ‘all-round’ value of the Festivals was ground breaking when BOP pioneered it for the 2010 Festivals Impact Study, and was the first study of its kind — not just for the twelve Edinburgh Festivals, but more widely in the Festivals and events sector.
This current study follows on from the methodology developed in 2010 and provides the first directly comparable data on the impacts of the Festivals at a five-year follow-up stage.
Read the full report, as well as the earlier 2010 report here.

I didn’t think that mice were good at climbing… until I rented a flat in Edinburgh!
If you’ve ever visited Edinburgh you’ll have noticed that much of the city is comprised of stone tenement flats. These ‘apartment blocks’ are usually 3 or 4 storeys high, often with a row of shops on the ground floor. Many date back to the 19th century, and most of them have rows and rows of chimneys on their terraced rooftops.
I’ve lived in several of these tenement flats, and visited many more. They are popular with students and young couples alike.
Being built of solid stone, with wood and plaster walls, there are gaps a-plenty. There are cracks around the skirting boards, in the backs of cupboards, around the old boarded up fireplaces (Edinburgh’s nickname of Auld Reekie comes from the smog emanating from the densely packed flats with a coal fire in each room!).
The tenements have been loved and lived-in by generations of Edinburghers. They provide a great place to live for people who enjoy the buzz of a capital city. They also provide the ideal place to live and bring up your family if you are a mouse!
3 of my flats were on the top floor. These were all on the third floor (fourth if you include ground floor). My flat in Marchmont had incredibly high ceilings, so I was a long way up! You can imagine my surprise when I first heard scratching noises behind a wall. I initially put it down to the students who lived next door.
The next sign that we had furry friends was when I repeatedly found myself cleaning up my flat-mate’s cornflakes on the kitchen worktop. How could he leave such a mess every day?! After a week of daily cleaning I picked up the cereal packet to wipe underneath, and a cascade of cornflakes tumbled from the box.
A mouse had eaten its way through the cardboard.
Soon after the kitchen incident I arrived home one afternoon to find myself face to face with a very well-fed brown and grey mouse, standing quite unperturbed in the middle of the living room floor!
Our eyes met, and for several seconds he sat up and stared right back at me. Without any fear, he then continued munching away on the biscuit crumbs he had found under the table, or down the side of the sofa.
I ran at him, not quite knowing what I would do if I caught him. The mouse nonchalantly ducked back through the tiny crack in the wall, just under the window, and was gone.
It was then that I decided the only way to deal with this was call out the pest control people. A friend had recommended a local mouse control company in Edinburgh so I gave them a call and they arrived the next day.
It was only then that I realised that Edinburgh tenements had the perfect network of tunnels, nooks and crannies which were ideal for mice to travel freely between floors, and build nests in the warm cavities behind those old walls.
The main thing I learned was to NOT LEAVE FOOD LYING OUT. I became an ardent fan of tupperware containers. In the end I didn’t have to kill any mice. I cleared up any traces of food, and blocked off the hole they were using to enter my flat. I presume the mice now visit the other kitchens in that block of flats — the ones that still have cornflakes lying out on the worktop.

I had wanted to post our travel journey chronologically but that just hasn’t happened, we’ve been too busy in some places and I’ve been just plain lazy in others. Perhaps I will write more about the other places our travels have taken us — Miami/New York (USA), Dominica (Caribbean), Havana (Cuba), Lisbon/Vilamoura/Carvoeira/Sintra (Portugal), Marbella/Malaga/Ronda (Spain), and Athens/Sifnos (Greece) and Dublin/Greystones (Ireland) — later. Chandler has been counting how many accomodations [AirBnB, hotels, TrustedHousesitters pet sits] we have stayed at since leaving Los Angeles 13 weeks and 5 days ago, and we are officially at # 26.
He started counting after seeing a couple of retired YouTube travel vloggers declare that they had stayed at 11 places in two months and they called their pace “insane”… he did the math and realized we “won”, yah and sigh.
We are now in Scotland. We started by exploring Edinburgh, which I loved, and then we went to the Scottish Highlands which I love even harder.
Edinburgh was stunning, it looks like every indie movie you have ever seen set in Scotland, cobblestone roads, castles built hundreds of years ago perched on rock formations formed thousands of years ago. But we kept reading things about “Edinburgh’s dark past” [truthfully they seem a little proud of it] so finally I googled it. Here are some of the juicy-awful results:
Edinburgh had some of the largest witch hunts in Europe with hideously sadistic torture methods, burning alive at the stake was one of the kinder methods and of course the bubonic plague in the 16th and 17th century.
“In 1456, a defensive wall was built around the Old Town. Problem was, no one wanted to live outside it, so as the population grew, people were packed together in increasingly unsanitary, greasy, moldy conditions. The only way to expand was upwards, so buildings got taller until they were up to 14 stories high, but had no toilets or running water. Residents would throw their waste out of their windows, shouting “gardyloo” as an advance warning, but it didn’t always work, and passers-by would get covered in poo.” [Source: Buzzfeed]
“Pestilence spread particularly rapidly in the tenement-filled, poverty-stricken, unhygenic conditions of the Royal Mile, and the council reacted with particularly brutal measures. When an outbreak hit the crowded Mary King’s Close, they ordered it to be bricked up, trapping over 300 infected and non-infected residents in their homes.” [Source: Buzzfeed]
But by the time we reached Edinburgh on June 4th, 2024 it was pretty damn civilized. We went to a little vegan options restaurant, had a couple of craft cocktails, and retired back to our AirBnB, certainly one of the prettiest I have been in, located in a historic building a block from the train station.
And as Taylor Swift was performing that weekend at Murrayfied Stadium, a herd [a gaggle, a flock, a swarm…a murder?] of Swifties descended upon Edinburgh. But as much as I hate crowds, they were so pink and sparkly and happy that it was hard to be annoyed at them. I almost joined them as ticket prices were “a bargain” compared to the U.S.A.; great seats could be had in Edinburgh for less than $500 as opposed to $2000 in L.A. and New York. But we didn’t, I fought my FOMO and won.
I thought I loved Scotland after seeing Edinburgh but man, it wasn’t until we got to the Highlands that I decided I really love it here. Despite the fact that it looks like every fantasy tale you’ve ever read as a child, with a demon possibly poised behind every moss-covered tree in the forest, that what is that sound-did I lock the door feeling I always had in the middle of the night in Los Angeles was gone. I felt safe. At last.
I really didn’t realize how the constant stress levels affected me both as a police officer in South Los Angeles and as a woman feeling vulnerable in her own home, but there was a palpable release when that feeling left me. It’s like a big warm hug and someone squeezing poison out of your system.
Crime is very low, air is clean, no natural disasters, and there are hardly any even predators, dogs are pretty much all floofs [and anyone who knows me knows I have loved and rescued bully breeds forever, but still, it is nice to walk a block without some ferocious sounding pack of dogs barking at you like my old neighborhood in Los Angeles], you are more likely to get hurt by a cow or a deer than anything else here. A cow or a deer.
How often could I take a walk in Los Angeles and not run into a single person, only hear the wind and the birds? In my entire life I can’t think of many places I can say that about. The beauty in Scotland is gob smacking, photos do not do it justice, epic mountains, rivers, forests and streams, Scotland has sights that are similarly as wondrous as Iceland without the swaths of humanity we encountered there.
Chela Landau’s youtube.com of a
Chandler saying goodbye to our Air BnB dog — Chela Landau’s youtube.com of
AirBnBs in Scotland bear no resemblance to any other place I’ve been. They ask you about your preferences, they stock the kitchen with vegan food, they meet you at the door and they often hug you when you leave.
At our AirBnB in Redcastle, Scotland the hostess showed us a “bothy” which we had access to during our stay with them, in U.S. terms it is like a man-cave shed, this one was small and cozy, had a wood burning stove and many candles. It was fabulous the one night we used it to read Harry Potter by candle light, intimate and romantic and exciting. Quite frankly though, the decapitated deer head staring at me with dead black eyes over the stove made me balk at going again back the next night as Chandler wanted.
But we were so content at our Redcastle AirBnB with it’s gorgeous garden and firth view, that we rarely ventured out except to get groceries at a market near us, which had a beautiful assortment of freshly grown fruit and vegetables.
After we got staples to eat the booze hunt was on, we found the local supermarket pretty well stocked [funny to see Jack Daniels in the foreign liquor section]. Looking for a local whisky for Chandler, I was corrected when I called it “Scotch”, they said that I should call it simply “Whisky” or risk insulting a Scotsman. (Yes, Scots remove the “e” in whiskey).
I have to say I’m a bourbon lass, I just can’t quite get behind that taste of moss in my drink, I will do better but for now it is tiny careful sips. I do love the stories however, I like the stories better than the actual whisky.
Any real whiskey drinker will know about “The Angel’s Share”; in medieval times when they would come to check on the barrels of whisky and they would have lost a third of the barrel’s contents to condensation, they believed that it was lost to the angels who had come down from heaven to sample their stock, and they figured in the loss as an offering that would make the angels smile upon them.
One of my favorite bourbon whiskeys is an American bourbon named Angels Envy in a sly wink to the folklore [athough in a bar we saw the sign “We have Whisky and Bourbon”, as though bourbon was a child of a lesser god and not worthy to be called whisky.
Anyhow, enough for today, we are going to Isle of Skye next and then Inverness to take a plane to Amsterdam, where we plan on settling in the Netherlands to begin our new lives; actually our new lives have begun, and every day is cherished.

I headed out at 10 but not before requesting a bottom bunk for tonight. Last night was hell! It goes without saying that I had to use the loo at least half a dozen times last night. Sometimes I don’t need to go at all or more usually, just once! I’m strong but not invincible. I was singing this song as I descended the spiral staircase. I was going to have a good day if it killed me.
My plan B was to buy some disposable adult nappies. Don’t laugh. They are the best invention since Scottish toasties which is what I’m having for breakfast right now. Filled with haggis, caramelised onion chutney and matured cheddar cheese. In the spirit of full disclosure, I did go to the Snax Cafe first, hoping for a full Scottish breakfast but I couldn’t get through the door — no I’m not that fat! — it was filled with people all waiting for food. It’s smoko time for the construction workers in the area. So I’m in the Snax Bakehouse next door where I’m enjoying a window seat and my coffee and Scottish toastie.

There are two things that strike me every time I walk the streets of Edinburgh.
The first is that nearly everyone is carrying tote bags full of groceries. So many flats in the city don’t have storage space, so grocery shopping is a daily errand.
The second is the incredibly disciplined behaviour of the dozens of dogs being walked by their owners that pass by me every day.
Their behaviour is invariably impeccable, regardless of age or breed.
They walk at their master’s side, many on leash, some not, keeping step, and seldom varying their focus from looking straight ahead. They don’t seem to take note of anyone or anything they pass by, including fellow canines. They don’t stop to exchange sniffs or even to sniff any of the myriad enticements at their level. Never has a passing pooch glanced up at me, hoping for a pat. One dog I noticed that did let its attention drift to the undergrowth of a shrub moved hastily along when its owner said: “Come along, love.”

The Only Fun in Town: A Primer for Edinburgh’s Experimental Music Scene,https://medium.com/@ollie_turbitt/the-only-fun-in-town-a-primer-for-edinburghs-experimental-music-scene-d7fd219f2d0d,"Sign up

*** Originally published (in slightly edited form) on http://brightsurroundings.wordpress.com, February 25, 2019 ***
Edinburgh’s music scene has always been, to an extent, fairly eclectic. Trad-folk pubs stand adjacent to metal bars, and indie kids nod their heads to glitzy guitar pop before hard techno nights on the Cowgate every weekend. While this diversity is self-evident, it’s impossible to ignore the fact that within each genre or sub-scene, artists tend to adhere to certain ideas of musical safety or appropriateness at their respective venues. I am by no means questioning the validity or talent of any of these bands — there are a huge host of genuinely fantastic acts who fall into this description that I actively support — but I would like to direct attention towards some of the city’s more obscure and boundary-pushing music which tends to be ignored by the scene as a whole.
By writing this article, I hope to present a primer for anyone interested in discovering more about Edinburgh’s incredible outsider and experimental musicians who are stretching genre limitations and forging their own paths within the city’s scene. This is not necessarily a definitive list; there is likely a myriad of under-the-radar performers who have escaped my attention so far, but I would like to stress that — as far as I’m aware — this group remains on the fringes of the scene. Consider my thoughts, listen to the music, go to see the acts play live — supporting these people will not only benefit the individuals, but will also foster support and encouragement for artistic experimentation in general. Dig in!
Oharasix: https://oharasix.bandcamp.com/
The experimental and the electronic always go hand-in-hand, as both tendencies tend to strive for sonic and technological innovation. Josh Corkill’s output under the ‘Oharasix’ moniker perfectly embodies this approach: digitally manipulated samples and loops combine to create an unsettling landscape of warped club tracks, dominated by rhythmic glitches and pumping techno-inspired kicks. This stuff is an audiophile’s dream, as Corkill’s manic production is jittery, maximalist and wholly unique. The two live releases available on the Oharasix bandcamp page are the best examples of his skill, as both performances are rife with repetitive, glassy synth stabs which fly around and punctuate the underlying beats of every piece. Having witnessed Josh perform at Sketchy Beats last year, I can fully recommend catching him live whenever you get the chance — using just Ableton and a modest MIDI controller, he has a prodigious ability to sculpt industrial noise into a seamless and infectiously dance-able mix.
Smiling Suns:
https://soundcloud.com/smilingsuns
Serving as the aural antidote to the noise of Oharasix, Smiling Suns is an ambient project centred around organic instrumentation and minimal arrangements. The anonymous musician’s SoundCloud page is home to some truly compelling compositions where art music, post-rock and folk collide. Appropriately titled, 2017’s Quiet Songs II is a collection of tranquil musical sketches, constructed sparsely on acoustic piano, accordion, and slide guitar. Smiling Suns’ bio lists both Stars of the Lid and Godspeed You! Black Emperor as influences, and it is easy to observe their mark on the affective melodies of ‘Rhema’ and ‘Baby Steps,’ but an immediate sense of individuality underpins the form of every track. ‘Duror’ features a stunning chorus of reverberating classical guitars which float over a droning accordion, and the lo-fi warmth of ‘Falling’ is mesmerising. This really is one of the hidden gems of the Edinburgh scene (and with such expert concealment of identity, Smiling Suns may well remain hidden) — I’ll be keeping an eager ear to the ground for new material in the future.
Aamber Glass:
https://northtsar.bandcamp.com/album/a-new-year-dithered-dreamer-doused-in-rays-of-sun-cutting-through-the-skyline-of-east-finchley
To continue with the theme of anonymous ambient artists, Aamber Glass is an equally elusive creator of intriguing and understated soundscapes. Only one release has been issued under the mysterious handle — 2018’s evocative ‘a new year’ / ‘dithered dreamer doused in rays of sun cutting through the skyline of east finchley.’ This limited edition cassette consists of two separate “bodies of work.” The first is a series of individual compositions, in which ethereal synth loops are accompanied by echo-drenched field recordings. A personal highlight is the track ‘susanna,’ where a chopped-up, tremolo-laden chord trembles above ghostly background noise and continuously overlapping synth melodies. On the second side of the tape, Aamber Glass builds a mammoth 20-minute wall of modulating drones. We are guided through turns melancholic and tumultuous towards a slowly-fading finale. It is a grandiose, meditative effort which is unabashedly experimental. I genuinely mean it when I say that art of this scope and dedication sets the bar high for any prospective avant-garde composers.
Harry Bongo: https://harrybongo.bandcamp.com/
Perhaps one of the best-known faces on the city’s scene is Mr. Harry Bongo: drummer for numerous noisy instrumental acts, contemporary classical composer and beloved cheese DJ, Bongo is Edinburgh’s diversity personified. Particularly arresting is his solo output, which sees Harry take complete creative control as he crafts an array of beautiful minimalist works. I use the tag ‘minimalist’ tag here with reference to the art music movement rather than production — while such comparisons are reductive, echoes of Reich, Glass and Riley are everywhere on his releases, as repeating mallet sequences evolve into rich climaxes of strings, guitars and percussion. Harry’s self-titled 2016 album displays the breadth of his oeuvre: centrepiece ‘Vessels’ begins with a pulsating groove (which isn’t too far removed from Reich’s Music for 18 Musicians ), and this quickly morphs into an intense, cinematic swirl of computerised arpeggios and throbbing drums. Pieces such as ‘Prague’ and ‘Ashes’ are more restrained, with layers of lush strings and field recordings creating a warm sense of space. After an almost two-year break, Harry released ‘Three in Four’ in late 2018, a hectic single which twists and turns, weaving samples of Björk talking about her TV over frantic drum loops, distorted pianos and wild, echoing synth bleeps. Without giving too much away, I can recommend keeping an eye out for an imminent release — Bongo is back (and in good form, too).
Joe Coghill:
https://soundcloud.com/joecoghill
According to a short biography on the Glasgow International website, Joe Coghill is “a multi-disciplinary artist, musician and experimental publisher,” and so he neatly represents a kind of avant-garde mindset that is crucial to a revitalisation of the scene. “His practice,” it goes on to explain incorporates “video, performance, social sculpture, facilitation and media distribution” (one example of this is his curation of an exhibition at Edinburgh’s Fruitmarket Gallery inspired by no-wave composer John Margotti.) While it’s obvious that Coghill’s work isn’t limited to audio, the small amount of his works available online are incredible displays of experimental electronics. Fans of IDM bastions Aphex Twin and Squarepusher will be particularly at home with the material on his SoundCloud page, which closely resembles one of RDJ’s famed audio dumps: the mammoth collection of twisted samples and glitchy, granular atmospheres features esoteric track titles such as ‘bv,mt Eye’ and ‘Ae_frag.aef2dream’ (a cheeky nod to Autechre, perhaps?) Despite the obvious influences of these pieces, Coghill’s approach is far from derivative. His paranoid sequences and ceaseless folds of noise are refreshingly imaginative, and provide a welcome break from the monotonous tech-house of Edinburgh’s clubs. Dive in!
Mixed Signals: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj_Jrf-g6BPebK7CXKjDLBg
…And now for something completely different. Live double bass and laptop electronics form the crux of Mixed Signals’ sound, providing a base for a tapestry of sinister drones, eerie vocal snippets and chopped-up field recordings. Long-form, slow-burning pieces are the specialty of these local experimenters, who have concocted a special brand of “mesmerising doom.” As the ensemble tend to operate as a live unit, they don’t currently have a lot of material online — however, their Youtube channel is home to two intriguing examples of their work. ‘The Door to Desolation’ is a 16-minute jam recorded live at the Black Medicine Basement, and ‘Taster Sounds’ is “not polished, not prepared, just a bit of an improvised draft of a taster of a teaser.” Although both of these are presented as spontaneous compositions, they are impressive statements of unique musicianship and an unorthodox approach. Both videos display the band’s love of serpentine beats and menacing synth pads punctuated by swathes of maverick double bass. In addition to the striking music, the videos themselves are incredible — clips which seem to be pulled straight from Norwegian “slow TV” are juxtaposed with unsettling, handwritten phrases and abstract sprays of light. This fits in with the tendency of local avant-garde creators to foray into the world of multimedia, and adds an interesting audio-visual edge to the group’s vision. Keep an eye out for Mixed Signals on the local circuit, as their live show is one of the scene’s most immersive experiences.
Liam Baker:
Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/liambaker.music.poetry/
Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T6r5QiBtww&feature=youtu.be
On the subject of multimedia, Liam Baker is a prolific creator of harrowing music, stunning poetry and exploratory film projects. At first glance, Liam’s music isn’t perhaps as out-there as some of the others on this list, but both his subject matter and his approach to creation are more than deserving of the “experimental” tag; consider the self-made video for ‘Consumatum Est (It Is Over),’ in which Liam sings a funereal melody and accompanies himself on classical guitar from the comfort of his own bathtub. His dynamic live performances consist of spoken word and solemn acoustic ballads, which marry such gloomy subjects as death, drug use and gentrification with a healthy dose of black humour. I once had the pleasure of watching Liam perform to a room full of avid punks and metalheads, and you could literally hear a pin drop from start to end; the remarkably attentive silence was testimony to Liam’s enigmatic stage presence and the powerful delivery of his lines. As with Joe Coghill and Mixed Signals, Liam’s music makes up a small fraction of his overall creative output: he’s one of a select group of all-round creatives who are fully stretching their limits and showcasing the possibilities of being an “artist” on Edinburgh’s underground circuit.

I visited National Museums Scotland (NMS) and Scottish National Gallery (SNG)in Edinburgh and experienced some stunning pieces. Below I have shown and written about a few of the designs I took a liking too from NMS however I couldn’t share any of my favourite pieces from SNG as no photography was allowed due to the possibility of people creating forgeries.
This exact skeleton of the giant deer is the first ever complete version. This was given over to the university of Edinburgh as, at the time (1921), it was one of the world’s best natural history collections. It was then given over to the National Museums Scotland and remains there still. These skeletons are important as they help with discovering what animals have become extinct in the past. What I find most interesting is how fresh and recent this skeleton looks due to how well its been preserved but it is in fact 12,300 years old. I find skeletons like this very interesting as you get to see every tiny (and giant) bone put in the body and see how different and delicately designed every body is. It’s not everyday you have that opportunity. Lastly, I like the placement of this piece as it’s right at the entrance to all the animals exhibits and I feel it’s successful in catching your eye and dragging you towards that area of the museum.
This piece is about our path throughout life. In this you can see the figures in the circles are symbolic for perishing, rebirth and transforming. The golden thread wrapped around the figures is meant to show its leading the way out of this maze, symbolizing their life line. I enjoy this piece through the depth and reality of the meaning Kinnaird brought to it; it really made me reflect on my own life and how fragile it really is. Moreover, the colours are very vibrant and I feel that the prominent red colour suggests blood and health whereas the blues and purples suggest an ambition (possibly to escape the maze?) and peace.
This design is a printed textile piece which was created for Liberty & Co and Hull Traders. The material used was screen-printed woven cotton satin. The main colours used in this piece are pinks, reds and oranges which suggests a warm atmosphere. I think that McNish may have used these colours to match title of “Painted Desert” as when you think of a desert you typically think of an isolated, sandy area where there is a blistering heat. I like the abstract vibe and colour scheme to this piece of design as I feel they are in harmony with each other due to their wild, creative style.
Artist, Eduardo Paolozzi, played around with geometric shapes and designs for this piece with a variety of colours and shades. This particular piece was the first ever designed for Wedgwood. The materials consist of screen-printed porcelain. I am intrigued by Paolozzi’s use of shapes and the intricate detail put into each small section of the plates. Personally, I am a big fan of geometric work and believe that Paolozzi done a fantastic job at presenting his style here. The colours used throughout are mostly warm colours and shades with a few cold colours in contrast which I feel just adds to how eye catching they are.

When I first stepped outside of the Edinburgh Airport, I realized I had no plans on what I wanted to do and see during my short week in the city. I didn’t know anyone else on the trip besides my roommate, and I didn’t know what I would do in Edinburgh. I hadn’t researched much, because my roommate had a million places she wanted to visit. I knew she would pick some pretty stunning attractions as she loves traveling abroad and has done so before.
Our first destination was a two hour walking tour across the city with a lively English tour guide named Georgia. I followed along and found so many beautiful sights; I had my camera open on my phone for the entire two hours! I listened intently as she brought us to each destination, stopping to learn of the city’s history and value. My favorite stop was the Supreme Court of Scotland, a massive stone building with beautiful arched doorways. I turned a full 360 to see it all, and was met with very intricate stained glass windows. We were only there for a few minutes, as we had to make our way through the rest of the city. After a full day of travel, we went home and fell right asleep to prepare for our first full day exploring Edinburgh, Scotland.
The next day we were up bright and early for our first class. The building our classes were held in was full of chandeliers and stunning pink painted walls. I couldn’t believe…

I am writing this from The Elephant Cafe in Edinburgh, famously known as one of the places where J.K. Rowling began crafting the magical world of Harry Potter. Sitting here, surrounded by creativity and history, I found myself reflecting deeply – not on spells or magic, but on something equally powerful: the human experience of pain and suffering.
Pain and suffering are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same. Pain is physiological – it’s a natural part of being alive. We feel it when we are hurt, physically or emotionally. Suffering, on the other hand, is psychological – it is the narrative (our interpretation of the event) we attach to that pain. We suffer when we replay painful events in our minds, hold on to guilt, or worry about an uncertain future.
The truth is, pain is unavoidable, but suffering can be avoided.
The Root of Suffering
Suffering arises when we resist what is. When we wish things were different, when we fight against reality, we create inner turmoil. But when we accept pain as part of our journey, suffering begins to dissolve. Acceptance does not mean we like the pain – it means we stop adding layers of mental and emotional resistance to it.
A Shift in Perspective: We Are Spiritual Beings
What helps me reduce suffering is a spiritual perspective that has profoundly changed my life.
I believe we are spiritual beings having a human experience. Before we are born, our spirit chooses the lessons it needs to learn in this lifetime. It chooses life situations, relationships, and even challenges that are aligned with those lessons. In fact, the more evolved the spirit, the more intense the lessons it chooses.
Think of the world as a giant school, where nearly eight billion unique courses are happening at the same time. Spirit learns these lessons through life situations we experience in our human form. But when we are immersed in the human experience, we forget our true nature. We resist the lessons our spirit came here to learn, and in that resistance, we create suffering. It islike a student refusing to study – he fails and has to repeat the class. Likewise, our soul may have to revisit the same lessons in future lives.
How Do We Break the Cycle?
The key is acceptance – not passive resignation, but deep inner alignment with the purpose of our soul/ spirit. When we stop fighting our circumstances and instead ask, “What is my spirit trying to learn through this?”, we shift our suffering into understanding, and our pain into growth.
Sometimes, the lesson might be patience. Other times, it may be resilience, compassion, or learning to see from a different perspective. When we embrace this idea, we begin to navigate life with more grace and strength.
We may not have control over the cards life deals us, but we do have the power to play them wisely. Life does not expect perfection. It asks only that we do our best, learn, evolve, and keep moving forward. That is all our spirit truly seeks.
Sitting here, inspired by the place where a story changed the world, I hope these reflections help you find your own strength. Whether you are facing pain or walking through suffering, remember: you are not just a body or a mind – you are a spirit on a journey. And every life situation, especially the painful ones, is part of your evolution.

Enjoying an experience is not a constant single note. I enjoyed the break I just took, but I didn’t walk around Edinburgh with a constant fixed grin on my face.
Anyone who says I did — is probably related to me.
I enjoyed the trip there and back as well — slowly, by car, with overnight stops — but the ninety-minute stopped-traffic experience on the M6 isn’t something I will want to replicate if/when there’s a next time.
Having time to ask “Where is the gift in this?” made me notice the light snowstorm of blossom wafting in around us from the verge, but I don’t think I would have ticked the “Stop and notice the flowers” box if I’d been given the option.
For the trip, I hauled out my ancient case of CDs and played them in random order. Some CDs were easy to skip through, but there were a few happy surprises.
I have Dusty Springfield, The Doors, The Stranglers and Deva Premal left over for my next outing in the car. That’ll be a day.
Edinburgh is a tolerant, good-humoured city. I liked the buses (capped fares), and in particular, I liked watching the drivers chatting away (briefly) at their change-overs. Every one of them needed to stop again and adjust their nearside mirror.
I remember Red Kite Cafe for brunch and Cobbled Roastery for coffee and one day we had a good lunch at The Pantry. One night we went all the way to the Radio Rooms in Berwick-upon-Tweed for Hunter & McMustard.
Browsing the shop-fronts in Stockbridge, we talked — somewhat more seriously than not seriously at all — about the distinctive Scottish cuisine that has evolved out of deep-frying everything from Mars bars to pizzas. Do click that second link.
You don’t know until you’ve tried. I wanted to ask what difference air-fryers might make, but missed the moment.
We walked through the Royal Botanic Gardens (without visiting the cafe), and sat for a while on a bench in The Meadows. That was the sunniest day.
Edinburgh is a tolerant, etc., city of cobbled streets, green spaces and small coffee shops and cafes. There’s a National Gallery and a National Portrait Gallery, and in the centre, always bagpipes playing somewhere.
Blackwell’s is the bookshop to visit. There are also Warhammer and Forbidden Planet if you need more storytelling.
I was overnight in a “Single Octo Glamping Pod” at the Drummohr caravan site on the edge of Musselburgh (26 bus into Edinburgh). Fridge, kettle, under-floor heating. Heart 80s Radio playing in the shower block. Their record collection includes Alison Moyet, Human League and Duran Duran; my CD collection doesn’t.
And then the journey home.
Curving motorway through Cumbria and the Lake District — yes, I did stop at Tebay — and then the heavier traffic and older, occasionally elevated, roads through the Midlands, and then — yes, I did stop at Gloucester — the wide open skies and stretching-away rivers of the Somerset Levels.
I spent most of it daydreaming ways in which I was going to be much more efficient when I got home. I would do this, and this, and organise that, and there would be no more procrastination.
And now I’m home.
And I think I’ll be much more efficient — tomorrow.
In case this needs saying, there are no affiliate links in this story. I just got carried away with all the looking-up and linking.
The National Portrait Gallery is worth a visit for the building and the chance to sit down. There’s a cafe. And pictures. Some people are well-served by their portrait artists; some … not so sure.
Lothian Buses runs an ad for its app on a screen in its buses. First, the ad tells you to scan the QR code to get the app, and then — I liked this — the ad gives you detailed instructions on how to scan a QR code.
Helpful. If I’d been staying longer, I would have scanned the QR code.
Or at least, worked out how.

Dear Kin, Supporters, Friends, and Enemies,
Some of you may know I was currently planning to attend the Edinburgh Fringe 2024, with my debut hour “Burning Down The House.”
Some of you may have kindly made a donation to my GoFundMe appeal to get up there. (Will discuss this more & the action plan for it now a bit later in this post).
Some of you may have even experienced a WIP show, where each time a different audience member was comedically “saved,” from the apocalypse/a burning building by the end of the night.
It turns out the person I need to save most is me.
I’ve been doing a very good job at pretending for a while now, that I am not in physical pain from having Covid.
I’ve been in hospital several times for severe pain & breathing problems, there have been times where I’ve found myself unable to function cognitively with brain fog and memory problems, crying in the street unable to make a choice, or know where I am and I was recently diagnosed with Costochondritis, an inflammation of my ribs & chest, that could become chronic and lifelong if I don’t rest & focus on an anti-inflammatory diet & lifestyle.
So in true cosmic joke style it turns out the person on fire the whole time was me!
I have decided to really listen to and prioritise my physical body and needs and dare to imagine what a different way of doing things & living might look like…
I have also realised that so much of my creative work so far has been built on ignoring my body, it’s needs & any physical or emotional pain I might actually be in.
I wonder what kind of creative work I would make if I wasn’t always in survival mode?
What kind of work would I make if the source of all my material wasn’t just trauma & pain?
What would I make if my life was more easeful, held and had community, care & joy in it?
I have to admit for a long time now, sustaining a creative career in the arts has largely involved me pretending I am on an equal footing to others, when in fact I’ve been struggling with access to affordable stable housing & a lack of any supportive, nourishing context in my personal life, that would make true exploration, risk taking, play and expression possible.
Like many others I have bought into the punishing story that if I just worked hard enough, or contorted myself correctly, at some point my day would come..I’d get the shot to express myself, or say something, or be met with the resources that could liberate me from the chaos of surviving and afford to buy a stable home.
But right now my body is howling, saying what about now?
What about living right now?
And making choices that mean no one gets burned down in the making of things.
If the price of success and “a future” is your physical health, I’d say it’s too high.
My people pleasing self, still worried about letting people down, sat on the floor crying, making up excuses & justifications and blatant lies for how much ibuprofen could achieve!? How I had been met with motivating external validation in getting so many people to help fund this & bring it to life…
Including a network of incredible humans on a GoFundMe page & the Phoebe Waller-Bridge spirit of the fringe fund (it’s not called that I know, but I’m an annoying twat and I’ve been enjoying pissing people off by calling it the Hot fleabag priest award).
I also got some money from the Best in Class bursary, I have a big supportive agent & a lush director offering her time & energy for free…all these resources and a good venue and time slot, so that should make it ok to destroy myself right!?
Because I’m so bloody lucky!?
Yet with all of those things combined: A GoFundMe, a working class bursary, money from the fleabag God’s, an agent who will front some costs, a director in kind…I’m still only half way there to covering it!
With costs of accommodation & venue/tech/marketing fees, I’m still looking at coming away pulverised and in debt or best case scenario breaking even with a side of burnt ribs.
Also I simply cannot push or mask anymore, there’s not enough caffeine, ibuprofen or sugar that would get me through!
I should clarify here. The fleabag hot priest award will be returned to someone who needs it (don’t think it’s even arrived yet) and I’ve just returned the Best in Class bursary.
Also I am going to explain the options for the amazingly generous GoFundMe donations here:
I raised a whopping 2,319 quid on my Go Fund Me from some deeply generous souls, in a challenging time for many with rising living costs.
I’d love to return these funds to anyone who needs it, my email address is: charliegeorgecomedy@gmail.com please send me your bank details and I will be able to do this for you, please please don’t be afraid to do this, if you need it, it’s yours.
Another option available is that I had already started to make lifestyle changes as advised by medical professionals I’d seen since having Covid and begun reducing my gig schedule and volunteering at a local farm near where I live in Kent.
Getting my hands in the soil has been so healing for my nervous system and breathing and learning about growing has been transformational even in a short time.
This farm is challenging the “cost of living” crisis by providing affordable veg box schemes to the local community & offering some free in partnership with a local food bank. I’d love to offer your donations to this & my continued work with it, as they are doing great things for the community.
If you’d be happy for this option, you can also email me & I will ensure it goes there and can keep you updated on the work we’re doing. I regularly post pictures from there on insta anyway covered in dirt!
I was also going to offer another option of me doing a more accessible version of the show with access needs considered in London and this money would go towards that!…
But let me discuss that with my agent team and see what’s possible for showcasing my stand up in an accessible way and I will keep you posted/do an announcement…
Many of you know I’m late diagnosed neurodivergent and am committed to access & disability so would love to do something that supported other people who are living with chronic conditions who would find a festival environment too challenging to see work in…watch this space!
For now, I’m not sure where I’m at with gigs and gig life and the toll it takes on the body…
I’m honouring my final few contracted commitments over the summer, with lots of space for rest, healing and recovery in between.
My body has said a clear no to this model & format for expression right now.
Maybe yours says yes!
If so I salute you, go for it, play, experiment, take big risks, have fun!
All we have is now.
Say what you want to say & bring forth your gifts.
I still believe we all have them and they all have equal value and worth.
I love the arts & creative expression, it has always given me the opportunity, the dignity & the daring to examine, express and celebrate life!
I’ll never stop making.
I just need to find a different, healthier, slower way…
So for now, I’m out of the game.
Thanks for all your support and/or hatred of me & my work thus far, it’s all been really useful for the soil!
x Big Love.

Stories of Dennett (Wildflower) & Ben (Weed) & Our Guests

Member-only story

After a few months of absence from posting anything on Medium or my WordPress blog, I am hoping the past week marks a turning point. This writing hiatus has been mainly due to dealing with the shock and grief of my dear sister’s death in December, exacerbated by what I am calling Political Depression: a feeling of paralysis in the face of catastrophic global events (about which I hope to write soon). And losing the inspiration I found from my experience of moving from Sheffield to the Aberdeenshire coast: once I had seen a full year through, I felt I have nothing new to say.
Nothing to do but to get away! It’s been hard to make time for a break for various reasons, but last week we managed to book a couple of nights in Edinburgh, a city we barely know, and do a pure tourist visit.
Just coming out of Waverley station into the spring sunshine with the expansive haven of Princes Street Gardens running through the city centre, and the castle on the rocky mound above, was an immediate lift to the spirits.

Outside of the United States, Scotland is the country that I have visited more often than any other, and has become my favorite.
Give me a moment to try and persuade you to give this rainy, northern country a chance!
They may not be your average beaches, but they are important! The ocean here is both beautiful and the main reason for Scotland’s concise temperature range and rainy weather.
Here are a few photos from Edinburgh, Scotland’s capital. There is so much history in the major cities, as well as the towns and villages.

If I see one more Instagram post with the caption “Sing me a song of a lass that is gone” I’ll scream.
Scotland is full of tourists, taking snaps and posting them, but I’ve noticed one thing when I read about their trips.
They hardly ever mention Glasgow.
Have you even really seen Scotland if you haven’t been to Glasgow? A lot of people seem to think “it’s a waste of time” that could be better spent in Edinburgh or Glen Coe. Or checking off Outlander locations.
They are so wrong. Add it to your bucket list. Stay a while and absorb the vibe of the city. Glasgow rewards time spend there — and you will fall in love with the place!
Well, Outlander did get one thing right — Scotland is a tribal culture!
Think about the football teams. Rangers vs Celtic; Hearts vs Hibs. If you want to avoid a fight make sure you say you support Partick Thistle. All of this is based on old sectarian rivalries. Protestants vs Catholics.
But there’s city rivalry too. Glasgow is the friendly, blue-collar, ‘real’ Scotland. Edinburgh people are…

It was great to meet more of the Travel Massive community at Travel Massive Edinburgh’s first event of 2021, on Thursday 28 January.
After introductions and updates from the Travel Massive Edinburgh chapter leaders Lesley, Susan and Katy, with a focus on the role of communities, including Travel Massive and Women in Tourism, we heard from Susan Russell, Head of Marketing, Underbelly, on how for the first time, Edinburgh’s Hogmanay had gone completely digital in 2020.
Susan shared some of the impressive audience engagement statistics and reminded us of the powerful combination of drone technology, poetry, music and film in the video clips she shared. We learned that the Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well piece has been viewed over 6.2 million times (direct views) on social channels and has generated around 650 pieces of media coverage. 150 drones were used in the piece, and this was Scotland’s first ever swarm drone show.
Josh Ryan-Saha, Director of Traveltech for Scotland, introduced the cluster’s aims and objectives and shared updates, also focusing on the power of community and letting people know how they can get involved.
We were then introduced to one of the entrepreneurs in the Traveltech for Scotland community, Elaine Ford, who shared information about her early-stage start-up, Electrek Explorer, a mobile app for electric vehicle tourism, offering opportunities for collaboration across the tourism sector in Scotland and striving to develop a solution towards a greener economy.
The event generated some great industry chat and facilitated valuable connections between members which was great to see. We look forward to more events in partnership with the Travel Massive community and thanks also to Ian Cumming and Maria Stoyanova of Travel Massive for their isupport for Traveltech for Scotland.
Watch the Travel Massive Edinburgh event recap video here, catch Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well again, including the poetry and music from the event. Watch Elaine Ford talk about start-up Electrek Explorer.

Last year in May, I traveled to the magical city of Edinburgh, Scotland. While it wasn’t my first time there — I had spent my birthday there the year before — I was excited to be going back to immerse myself in the city’s rich history and culture as much as I could.
The primary reason why I went back was Beyonce. Edinburgh was one of the stops of the European leg of her Renaissance World Tour, and since Dublin wasn’t one of them, I bought the tour tickets to the closest city — after all, Edinburgh is only 50 minutes away from the Irish capital by plane.
Whenever I think of this trip, I get super emotional. I lived some of the best five days of my life in ways I can’t fully express. Starting with the city itself as it is absolutely stunning. It is my favorite city in the UK for its majestic, medieval, Georgian, and neoclassical architecture and rich history. Walking in Edinburgh feels like a scene out of a movie where you’re the main character. Ok, the accent might be a struggle at first, but I always found the locals to be friendly and patient, making it easy to navigate and connect.
Secondly, the day of the concert — as well as all the previous Beyonce-themed parties I attended there —…

“Piled deep and massy, close and high; Mine own romantic town”
-Sir Walter Scott, Marmion
In Peterborough, the station where I had transferred onto my train, I had thought about how the blankets of grey across the sky do not mean gloom. They just mean a cloudy day. Yes, no sun. But also, no sun in my eyes. The muted tones were becoming synonymous with the UK in my mind.
But that day, by the time the train was gliding toward Edinburgh, those grey clouds had broken up enough that tides of sunlight washed over the land between them. The hills and farmland sped by, but I was sitting still. Laughter bounced up the cabin. A family was sitting behind me a few rows back, and at the heart of their babble was a high note of wonder — a little girl, enraptured by everything.
“Woooah! Woooah!”
“It’s another train!” exclaimed a deep, gravely voice. He animated his voice to match her bright wonder.
“Look grampy,” she chimed, “here it comes! WOOOAH!!”
Their chatter pulsed through the continuous hum of the train, then fell back under it again and again, as tidal as the waves of sunlight breaking through outside. Occasionally, amused laughter burst from the whole group. I smiled. The world was new and bright to her, and she was bringing that gift to the whole cabin. It was going to be a good weekend, I thought. Later, a group of rowdy guys took their place in the back. It wasn’t hard to make out their loud voices, but I could only understand every fourth word through their thick Scottish accents.
When I got off the train in Edinburgh, I was surprised to find a flood of people exiting the station with me, many of them donning green and orange. The woman in the tourist information booth told me there was a big rugby match today: Six Flags Ireland vs. Scotland. Luckily these crowds only brought their excitement and energy, no disruptions or hassles for me.
Emerging from the station into Edinburgh was quite dramatic. In addition to the pockets of heart-warming human interaction I encountered on the train, arriving that way was worth it just for the visual effect. Waverly station is right in the middle of Old Town and runs underneath Edinburgh castle. So, when I walked up to street level, the slope to the castle and through romantic old buildings was my first impression of the city. One thing I loved about Edinburgh was its geography. It sits under the watch of two extinct volcanoes — the smaller Castle Rock to the West, where the castle sits, and Arthur’s Seat to the East, a much higher and windier hill that stands over the official residence of the royal family in Scotland. Other hills rise around the center like hands of the land cupping the city in its palm. Some of the houses spill out of the land’s grasp and trickle around the coast of the North Sea.
The entrance to my hostel was nestled right underneath the Castle. I was met by a friendly reception immediately inside the door. To the right was the check-in desk, to the left was a locked cage full of big backpacks and sacks. Passed that was the kitchen door. People were coming and going with cups of afternoon coffee. The receptionists asked where I was from. I told them I was American but studying abroad in London. Ah, gotcha, they said, cool. With swarms of young people arriving from all over the world, I’m sure they had heard that story many times. After getting my key, I wandered further underground, passed a couple of themed lounges with high ceilings, and reached a narrow, traditional-looking staircase.
The room was large and filled with at least eight sets of bunk beds. Each had a storage compartment, a safe, charging outlets by the bed, and a curtain to maintain some sense of privacy. And, since this floor’s theme was Harry Potter, my bed had a wooden nametag that said “Ron Weasley.” They didn’t skimp on décor, because the walls were spattered with murals. The hostel became a home base with a strangely easy sense of community.
Edinburgh itself seemed to have an easy way about it. I mostly wandered around during my visit, and it was all lovely. The Royal Mile, a straight street at the center of Old Town, entertained me for an entire afternoon. With Six Nations going on, the number of kilted bagpipers on the street was probably double the normal. As soon as one was out of earshot, I’d catch the notes of another just up ahead for continuous ambiance. There were bookshops and whiskey tours and fabric stores filled with traditionally woven plaid fabric, kilts, and everything else. I finished my first night with dinner at the pub and a pool game with some rugby fans at the hostel and went to bed exhausted.
On my second day, I visited the Scottish National Gallery, took a bus to New Town just to see the difference, and walked up Calton Hill to see the unfinished National Monument. Bundled up, eyes watering from the wind, I watched a group of older and younger kids try to clamber up the bracket of the monument’s huge foundation. The older kids, already on top, were weaving around the giant stone pillars, trying to reach around them and touch each other’s hands from opposite sides. They couldn’t do it and broke out in laughter at their failure.
By the time they left, the sun had set. Above the reach of any streetlights, the hill was becoming so dark that I could no longer make out the people fifteen feet in front of me. I almost climbed on top of the monument but awkwardly slipped down a couple times. I chuckled at myself because I had thought that I would do better than those kids. I held onto the pillar to feel like the wind wouldn’t push me off the hill, and then I looked toward the city. The lights were all on — human constellations shining through the thick night where the stars faintly answered back. The horizon line between them was a yellow glow over Edinburgh. I took a breath in, then sat down, taking it in until my body could not warm itself against the cold wind anymore.
On my last day, I took another wander around Edinburgh, scooting between the old buildings that sat almost on top of each other, and found other streets, apartment courtyards, and secret allies. Back on a main street, I found a small old church, which was no longer a church and now had a souvenir shop and UNESCO Heritage display set up inside. I wandered around and tried to imagine the kinds of people who would have gathered here when it had first been built.
I saved Arthur’s Seat for last. After my night on top of the National Monument, it seemed like the perfect way to take in the city one last time. Every stranger I met eyes with shared the same spark of exhilaration that I felt on those windy, open hills. Everyone couldn’t help but smile. Besides feeling like I was going to get blown off the mountain, the most memorable moment was thanks to a man who was out for a run.
He was wearing just a tiny pair of running shorts and shoes; he let his long hair do whatever it wanted. He zipped passed me and a couple that I had made friends with as we were climbing up to the actual “seat” of Arthur’s Seat. By the time we got one bend away from the top, we could look ahead and see that he had stopped to enjoy the view in a rather unorthodox way. I have to note here that I cannot over-exaggerate how windy it was; I was scared to stand near the edge of any hill, afraid I might literally be blown over by its force. This man had walked out to the very edge of the cliff and was perched on it with his legs slightly ahead of his body and his arms behind him, gripping the rock face. His hair was wildly whipping in the wind, and he was bellowing at the top of his lungs toward the city. The sound of his voice came in faint wisps when the wind blew it our way, but it was definitely a blood-curdling howl. He looked like a wild man that had crawled from a cave in the Scottish hills. We walked around the bend and lost sight of him for about a hundred feet, but we saw that he was still screaming when we got to the peak of the hill. And he hadn’t stopped when we kept going and eventually lost sight of him for good. Well, he’s either a little insane or he knows something the rest of us don’t, I thought. Most likely both.
You can just make him out in the picture below.
The train back glided through darkness, so instead of gazing out the window, I read my book and wrote in my journal about how I didn’t want to go back to reality. This time it wasn’t a little girl and her family, but a tired boy and his father still painted blue for the game. The boy fell asleep before their stop and his dad scooped his floppy little body up to leave. I used to pretend that I was asleep so my mom would carry me inside and tuck me in bed, and I wondered if he was using the same tactics.
On my second and longer train back to London, I fell back into my journaling and back into deep thought. The gentleman in the booth across the aisle from me was reading with his brows gently knitted together. A woman came along. She was loud, friendly, maybe ten years older than me, American. She asked the man if the seat across from him was taken; he shook his head and returned to his reading. She announced that she was whooped and was therefore going to the concession car to get a beer and we would like one too. The man accepted, I politely declined. Was I sure, she asked. Yes, thank you, I replied.
It was uncomfortable to be yanked from my thoughts by her conversation, but she slowly drew me in as she broke through small talk with the old man and got on to more interesting things. She knew I was listening, I think, and continued to address me across the aisle with a nod or a glance. She began talking about her plans to take a trip to the highlands with her friends, then the man revealed that he was from northern Scotland and could tell her all about the highlands. With that, I finally joined in.
We listened to his descriptions of the highlands, we asked each other questions, we shared opinions and plans, and we began to feel like we had always been this familiar with each other. They finished their drinks, and at some point they both got off at their stops. I was left with my own thoughts again, but this time they swam around with something deeper. And that something made me thank the world for long train rides and friendly strangers.

Scomo collapsed from a heart attack near the new commercial center that he detested. Hurried and busy pedestrians left him there, figuring he was a drunken tramp, until a feeble-minded woman knelt to care for him and discovered he was dead.
That’s how the writer George Scott-Moncrieff died in Edinburgh in 1974.
He loved Edinburgh, even though bulldozers and commercial developers had wrecked large parts of it.
Edinburgh is still lovable today despite the commercial-fueled bulldozer, says Alexander Larman in a recent essay in The Spectator, noting that Scotland’s capital “comes into its own” at New Years.
The Scots call the New Years “Hogmanay” and it consists of two days that the Scots celebrate like their Irish cousins celebrate March 17th.
Larman recommends Edinburgh at Hogmanay . . . or at any time.
“It’s a seductive place to visit,” says Larman, given its “combination of Georgian architecture, world-class museums and galleries, some fine independent shops, and top-notch restaurants and bars.”
If you’re going to Edinburgh, Larman recommends you take the train from London.
And if you can afford it, go first class on the London North Eastern Railway. It takes four hours, but it’s a great four hours.

Four days earlier in the early morning of Sunday 30th July I’d arrived at Davenant Foundation School in Loughton east London. The location for the start of the 2017 London — Edinburgh — London Audax. One of Britain’s greatest cycling challenges, the route stretches over 1400km between the two capitals taking in some of the most stunning scenery the UK has to offer.
It’s a simple concept. You just need to collect a stamp on the brevet card at each of the 19 checkpoints along the route and complete the ride in 100 elapsed hours. (A 116 hour time limit is an option but, in for a penny…)
Prior to this I’d never ridden anything on such a scale. I’d completed multi-day stage races, but they involved only 3–4 hours in the saddle each day. Similarly with Lands End — John O’Groats which I completed 15 years previous. Riding for just 6–8 hours a day leaves plenty of time for recovery and feeding.
Breaking this ride down in the months prior to the start, it looked straightforward. A schedule of somewhere in the region of 350km per day for four days. Factor in the cumulative fatigue and the forecast bad weather, however, and things start to look interesting.
I started well. From a 07:15 roll out I covered 340km to Pocklington by about 21:30. Helped by an always-welcome tailwind and fresh legs, the miles slipped by — especially in the Fens north of Cambridge and up through Lincolnshire to the Wolds.
I had picked up a ride partner in the Fens; a guy from Manchester. Initially I had plans of continuing to Thirsk but he was keen to stop. I knew there were lumpy roads to come so decided to get a bed at Pocklington. I slept reasonably well — helped by the earplugs provided by the organisers.
Clear, dry and mild. The road to Thirsk was in poor condition and given that I’d have been riding it in the dark I was glad of my decision not to continue the previous night.
The first big hill of the ride came out of Barnard Castle. A long drag followed by Yad Moss. By this point the cross-tailwind we’d enjoyed further south had shifted to a cross/cross-head as we’d turned north west. Yad Moss became a savage drag all the way from High Force up to the top. The descent was quick, though the wind took the edge off top end speed.
I was expecting the weather to be poor in Brampton. But it was one of the warmest places on the whole ride. A quick stop for food and a stamp in the brevet card and onwards to Moffat.
I’d ridden the road to Moffat 15 years previously on my End-to-End jaunt. Let’s call it utilitarian. It’s pretty featureless and seems to be littered with truck stops. The route had turned north again meaning the wind was mostly to our sides and backs. Progress was quick but my ride partner from Manchester dropped away, complaining of aggravating a historic injury.
I reached Moffat soon after 20:00, my ride partner following slightly later informing me of his decision to bail. He was disappointed, as was I for him. All the preparation and build up to not even reach the half way point.
I rolled out of the control on my own as the sun was setting.
Continuing on the route of my ride 15 years earlier, I remembered the road out of Moffat to be glorious. A lovely, steady gradient up Devil’s Beef Tub through beautiful scenery. This particular evening there was hardly a car to be seen and just a couple of other riders’ flashing rear lights in the distance for company. Throw in a lovely sunset and still air; this was pretty close to cycling nirvana.
Descending the other side I passed a rider stopped at the side of the road. The reply to the usual “Got everything you need?” wasn’t the standard “Yeah, thanks.” but “Actually, no!” Heaving on the anchors I met Mike who was on puncture number six of the ride and had ruined his tyre levers.
I leant him my box-fresh set and before long we were both rolling towards Edinburgh, arriving soon after 01:00.
Day three slapped us in the face with a 06:00 wake up to wet weather after four hours sleep.
Turning south meant the wind would mostly be in our faces or, at best, cross-head. The road out of Edinburgh down to Innerleithen and then Eskdalemuir beyond was lumpy and windy. The rain passed and the sun shone occassionally between the dark clouds. The scenery was beautiful: rugged, bleak and remote. My legs took some time to come to me, the first three hours were hard but by lunch I’d recovered some form.
The checkpoints passed. I ate a lot of food; pretty much a three course meal with a side of carbs. at each stop. 8–9000 calories a day is a lot to replace.
Brampton was reached around mid-afternoon. After thinking this would be one of the wettest points on the route it had turned out to be not just dry but also very warm. I had a bag left at this control so changed into fresh kit (mmmmmmm!) and rolled out in the direction of Alston.
Yad Moss. Again. The windy, bleak slog-fest on the way north was playing on my mind. I needed to get over this and make good time towards Thirsk for the night.
The climb south wasn’t anywhere near as brutal as the route north. It seemed to pass quickly and with relative ease. Riding along the top was beautiful. So much so that I stopped to take one of my few photographs from the ride.
The day ended in Thirsk some time after 01:00. A huge feed and four hours sleep later, we were back on the road just after 06:30.
430km to do. This was it. At 11:15 the last 24 hours in which to complete this ride would begin its count down.
The roads were relatively flat down to the Humber Bridge from Thirsk. But then it started to get interesting. The wind was straight into our faces. Unrelenting like the little climbs; some up to 15%. Up and down we went. Small groups forming on the road to help each other to the next control at Louth.
By Louth stories were coming back from the Fens about the ferociousness of the wind. Tired bodies were scattered around the control. Allegiances were being made to ride across the Fens as groups. Strength in numbers.
I grew up on the edge of the Fens. It’s my natural riding environment. The opposite of the high mountains. Flat roads providing an opportunity to ride steady state for hours on end—more suited to my 78kg. Throw in the promise of wind and I was secretly relishing what was to come.
We gathered our group together and rolled out of Louth in the late afternoon.
The road to Spalding was as advertised. I did a 35km turn on the front of our group. For that hour and a half I was riding a spring Classic in Belgium; driving the head of the bunch, putting everyone in dificulties. Although I was really just holding a steady 22–25kmh and giving four others shelter.
Spalding was reached as the sun was going down.
180km to go. We started to formulate plans. Short stops at the control and a two to three hour sleep before London? Or, slightly longer stops at each control but continue all night to the finish? We opted for the latter.
And so we settled in for the night shift.
The wind continued and it started to rain but spirits were high. The group chatted and rotated turns on the front.
As the hours passed and the tiredness crept in, the chatter decreased and we became more singularly focussed on keeping tidy in the group. Don’t fall asleep. Hold the wheel. Breathe the chilly air deeply to keep the senses alert.
We gathered waifs and strays as we rode. All looking for company and the relative saftey of a large group with our combined illumination on the dark, potentially dangerous, roads of south Lincolnshire.
The last control points passed in a blur of tiredness.
Stop, get card stamped, take on caffeine, eat whatever is plain and easy to get down, get back on the bike, continue riding south.
The sun rose as we approached Great Easton. The final control before home. There were some seriously tired bodies. People catching 20 minutes sleep sat at their bowl of cereal. I was falling asleep. A double shot espresso gel saved for this very occasion perked me up and we headed off for the final 48km of this monster ride.
We rolled into Davenant School at 08:32 on Thursday 3 August. Card stamped at 08:35. 97 hours and 20 minutes after I’d rolled out of the gates.
What. A. Ride.
Here are a few hints and tips that worked well for me in the build up to, and during, the event. With something like this, everyone has their own approach so take what you like from the below. Your mileage will likely vary.
I carried arm, leg and knee warmers with me on the bike at all times. Add in a gillet, rain cape and wet weather gloves and I was fine for cool night riding and wet weather. Maintenance wise: Three spare tubes (only one used), CO2, multi-tool, tyre levers(!), cable ties, electrical insulation tape, spare cable, pucture repair kit.
I carried small packets of Dove wet wipes with me. They helped keep myself clean between applications of chamois cream which, by the end of the ride, was twice a day. They’re also great for moisturising after a day of wind burn. My wife told me to take lip balm but I forgot it. And boy did I finish with chapped lips! Take lip balm! Even a quick teeth clean at a control gives you an extra 2km/h for the next hour or so. So, small tube of tooth paste and tooth brush.
The food supplied at the controls is excellent. Pasta bakes, chicken supreme with rice, mild curries with rice, rice puddings, sponge puddings with custard, porridge, cereal, hot drinks, loads of fresh fruit and cereal/flapjack bars of all varieties for between controls.
You can see the bike I rode above. It performed fautlessly. Disc brakes really are excellent in wet weather and especially so when you don’t get to clean your bike between wet rides. None of that scretchy, gritty brake block on rims. The dynamo front hub meant I never had to worry about power for phone or Garmin. Although, make sure you get everything charged during the day so the light is at full power at night. I rode 39/53 and 29/11 never feeling over geared.
I have a day job and a busy family life. I don’t have the luxury of being able to string together huge rides regularly. I did one 440km ride and a few 100–200km back to back rides. I think the most effective training I did was a few 200–400km rides on 4 hours sleep in the two months leading up to L-E-L.
I used a Garmin 810 and saved each leg so as not to overload it. Rides longer than 100km seem to make my Garmin turn off and dump the data. I strung them together using FIT tools for the Strava bragging rights.
I found the organisation of the event to be excellent across every dimension. The vounteers were outstanding at every control. They seemed to really enjoy their roles and nothing was ever too much effort at whatever time of day or night. Outstanding!

From the moment we all sat down around the table brainstorming, it was clear to us that everyone had a completely different idea on the task in hand. Some thought it was to find an obscure tourist experience, whilst myself and others thought it was maybe an app or something completely apart from the norm that would allow tourists to explore their surroundings.
To narrow our ideas down we brought in the help of a lecture to clarify the desired output from the task. It was at this point that we decided to Jazz up the idea of a day trip in the city, including Maps and Apps.
The main idea from the start was to have different independent business join together to create a day experience for tourists who wanted to see that REAL Edinburgh, and not the Edinburgh focused on chains and high street brands.
After becoming fairly confident on the idea we asked our Italian group member, Cecilia, to ask her friends and people she knew back home what they thought of this idea. The idea was given a positive backing so therefore we decided to go ahead with this.
We decided a walk round of Edinburgh would be beneficial to us and would allow us to gauge what independent businesses, obscure places we would like to have in our day trip.
We decided that best way to display/present our idea was to given an example of one of many day trips to see the REAL Edinburgh.
After deciding on the places we decided on a route that made the most sense and also fitted into the time slot of 10am — 10pm. By deciding on this route, it allowed us to create a map that would give the tourists an outline for their day trip whilst also giving them a memento of memorial value.
We decided that these maps could be picked up from Haymarket — The starting point of the trip — and each map would have a different day trip on each.
The day trip for our presentation was as follows
Overall the group worked Hard as a team and met on multiple occasions where one team member was unable to attend due to other commitments whilst keeping them in the loop via Facebook group chats.
Due to all 4 of us missing the primary lecture where the brief was given we felt behind on this task and worked extremely hard to be up to date and produce an Alternative tourist experience.
I feel with more time this idea could have been given a fully functioning app which worked in conjunction with the maps allowing tourists to build up a bank of obscure places and independent business’s creating a very personal memory bank.
