In the time from September 6, 2023 till September 9, 2023 I have been in Paris. It’s been the first time since 1996 and my first trip alone since visiting Moscow in 2011.
Before I booked my journey I already began learning some French with Duolingo. The French people were known to be very proud of their language and that they barely spoke or knew any English. And it shows some respect for the country you are visiting if you know at least some words in their language. Unlike Russian language French was far more related to Latin, English, Spanish, and German, the languages that I either speak natively or that I have learned in school.
My goal was to travel sustainable and on a budget. Means that I didn’t want to spend a lot of money and to avoid traveling by car or plane. I took a Flixbus from Bielefeld (Germany) to Paris (Bercy-Seine).
The good point here was that it was an overnight-ride from 10pm to 7:30am. I was solely worried about the Bercy Seine Bus Station which had terrible reviews on Google, just mentioning safety, cleanliness, and drugs. Just in case, I bought myself an Apple Tag before leaving for the bus if somebody would deliberately or accidentally take my luggage. But there’s no need.
After two stops in Düsseldorf and Cologne we arrived and I was postively surprised about the bus station. And Paris. After taking my luggage I went up the stairs left from the outdoor gym and I Paris as I would have never imagined it in my dreams.
What I saw was a Paris that mixed old and new, history and modernity. It was a nice ‘Bienvenue’ to somebody who just arrived in Town.
It was time to walk to the Tourist Office at Hôtel de Ville to pick up my Paris Visite metro ticket. With the ticket I am able to travel by train, metro, and bus in different zones of Paris. I have picked it for 5 days (4 days weren’t available and mixing 3 day tickets with a 1 day ticket made no sense financially) for the zones 1 to 3.
Because the office opened at 10am I decided to walk around and saw more of the beauty of Paris, but also its shadowy sites: Notre Dame and old, beautiful buildings, but also homeless people and the “traces” the homeless left in the night. With that in my mind while standing in front of the logo of the Olympic Games — and thinking of the reviews about Bercy-Seine — I hope that the municipiality of Paris will not chase away the homelss, but offer them real help to find a safe home and a job again.
While crossing the Pont d’Arcole I already saw the towers of the Cathédral de Notre Dame. The cathedral from the 12th century was still under reconstruction after a fire threatened to destroy it. Paris wants to restore Note Dame for the Olympic Games in 2024.
After some walking around I entered the Tourist Office of the City of Paris and received my metro ticket. It was just a little piece of paper, but it was powerful and it’s worth the price.
The people at the entrance were nice and so were the people in the office. Some spoke English, that’s helpful. With the ticket in my back I entered the Metro Parisiean and travelled via Metro Line 1 from Hôtel de Ville to Château de Vincennes, switched to a bus that brought me to Eugène Voisin — Marché from where I would arrive at my hotel Ibis Budget in Saint Maurice after a short walk. Saint Maurice, I must say, looked like a stereotype of a French suburb with the small businesses, its architecture and all. I just loved it. The hotel, by the way, was affordable when I booked it in late July 2023 with 86 EUR a night. It offered a bed, a bath-room, and a window. That’s fine. Two stars were enough for a hotel where I’d spend the time just to sleep and to take a shower.
After the check-in, unpacking, and changing clothes I was ready to explore Paris.
Due to Google Maps I knew that the next train station was not too far away. The train station Joinville Le Pont was just a bit more than half a kilometer away. While I was walking the way I had the first cutlural shock when I saw people crossing the street while the traffic lights were red. Unimaginable if you live in Germany. But if you don’t want to look like a tourist, do it like the natives.
Originally I wanted to see the Champs Elysee first. However, I decided to ride further. To La Defense. It was a good decision.
La Defense is a modern business district, according to Wikipedia “Europe’s largest purpose-built business district” , will blow you away if you weren’t already from the first impressions you got from the way to the Tourist Office.
What makes this district so special is not just the purpose of the district nor the skyscrapers everywhere, but that it’s aligned to the the Arc de Triomphe and the Place de la Concorde. Sitting on the top stair of the Grande Arche, you can spot the Arc de Triomphe at the end of the Avenue Charles de Gaulle.
And the Arc was my goal. I then though that the Avenue Charles de Gaulle was the famous Champs Elysée. Today I know that the Arc separates two avenues.
But I didn’t go straight to the Avenue. I went left and right to take photos everyhwere. It was fascinating to see the modern buildings just kilometers away from the historic center of Paris. Modern architecture next to history. And both co-existed very well, expressing France’s own understanding as a Grande Nation that is aware of its history but still advances through sciences and trades.
One thing that I wanted to do this time, unlike during my previous travels, was buying food and beverages in supermarkets rather than “tourist” stores. This, of course, was easier in Paris than if you are travel maybe in Montego Bay. In Paris you will always find a Franprix, Carrefour, or others. It’s also cheaper than buying water from the many street vendors selling you the .30 EUR bottles for 2 EUR or more. It was great to know that there’s always a store around the corner when walking in Paris during severe heat warnings. Whenever you need it, you just buy one or two bottles of water et voila, you have the supplies you need.
At Arc de Triomphe I had to realize that I didn’t eat enough for the day. I’ve been walking at least 15km then. Some medics in the metro helped me to regain energy. Obviously, I wasn’t the first one struggling with the heat that day. I decided to eat now rather than later and had dinner near the Arc.
The next day I wanted to start with a French breakfast: a baguette. Across the street was one of many “boulangeries” (bakeries). It cost less than a Euro. With the baguette in my backpack I started today’s tour: l’avenue Champs-Elysée. However, I didn’t go straight, but left at Chatelet Les Halles.
The coolest experience when taking a ride in Paris’ public transport system is what you see when you leave the station. You see castles, beautiful buildings, parks. At Les Halles I saw Le Bourse de Commerce right accross a modern building under which you arrive when riding to Chatelet Les Halles, a shopping mall.
Here I saw one of the other nice things Paris has to offer: water cooling. Everywhere in Paris you find cooling islands, water dispensers, or fog creators. On days like these where it is 33°C hot in an urban environment, cooling is important. More important, you can refill your water bottles for free! This is great even for the homeless.
Generally, you’ll recognize that Paris tries to make the shift from traditional city to a modern city and wants to be sustainable. It has many parks to offer, it offers a well-planned public transport system with trains, subways and electric or bio-gas-fueled busses and many bicycles. Apropos bicycles, if you visit Paris for the first time, you will realize that bikes have their own lanes and their own traffic lights. As a pedestrian you will not just cross the street, but also the lane for bicycles.
The trains and subway trains are coming regularly and the stations are well organized. I don’t say that you don’t need to walk a bit more, but due to the system in Paris you usually can’t take the wrong train, because every line has its own platform. And It’s a pleasure to sit in the trains which are clean and rarely too crowded.
Walking through the streets you will find little restaurants everywhere, often crowded and pouring on the charm of a France that we know from the movies.

À Paris by Francis Lemarque
Though I wanted to visit the Champs, I also had another destination in my mind. The Louvre. Home to Mona Lisa and other paintings. Traveling on a budget and with few days in Paris I didn’t buy a ticket. But you can get into the Louvre if you just want to see the famous pyramide. You only need a ticket for the museum itself.
After walking around the streets near Palace d’Elysée — well protected by the local police (and surely the military is also there) — I soon made it to the Avenue Champs Elysée. It went straight to the Place de la Concorde which was surrounded by installments for the Rugby World Cup that happened in France two days later.
But it looked awesome. The avenue’s wide with many trees on each side and you could easily spot the Arc de Triomphe. It felt so different to walk there in comparison to other streets, famous or not.
Walking up the street with an ice-cream in my hand I was amazed by the beauty of the buildings. Paris conserved the charming of its history and mixed it with modern life.
People there were both, tourists and native Parisians who did some window shopping or dined in the restaurants. And there were the stores run by luxury brands like Cartier, LVMH, Victoria’s Secret, and others. Definitely nothing for a budget trip, but impressive, specifically when you see the waiting line in front of one or two stores.
In the smaller streets you will also see other expensive brands, some seem to be only known if your checking account is several digits long.
Aux Champs-Élysées. — Aux Champs-Élysées. — Au soleil, sous la pluie, — à midi ou à minuit, — il y a tout ce que vous voulez — aux Champs-Élysées.

Changing the street side, I got another ice-cream. Yes, it was hot and the city of Paris recommended to drink a lot and to eat some cooled stuff. Or ice-cream.
I took a short metro ride and left at Louvre. This station was cool. The station was mostly covered by black, marble-like stone and had some expositions, like sculptures of, a.o. Marie-Antoinette, the wife of France’s last king before the French revolution of 1794.
What I definitely wanted to see in Paris was the nation’s national soccer team, also known as Les Bleus. France’s male team around Coman, Griezmann, and Mbappé played really well and on this day they had a match against Ireland in the Parc des Princes, the stadium of Ligue 1 champion Paris St. Germain. Originally, I think, France would have played in the Stade de France in the north of Paris. But this was being needed for the Rugby World Cup (the opening match between France and New Zealand’s All Blacks was nice).
Shortly walking around, talking to some Irish fans wondering about a German who cheers for France (and Ireland — French jersey, Irish wrist), I entered the area with my ticket and I witnessed two surprises. The text on my ticket said that the ticket (le billet) must be printed. However, others just used their phones. Also, I read not to take a backpack to the stadium. Surprise, some people took their backpacks into the stadium. With their laptops!
After the national anthems — Amhrán na bhFiann and La Marseillaise — the game began and immediately the atmosphere changed. Was it already great and cheerful, the audience began to push its team and commented every action on the pitch.
The Irish fans, though clearly a minority in the stadium, were audible and didn’t give up the team, even after the lagging behind 0–2. But Ireland fought hard and was a respectable opponent for the two-time world champion.
A little advice: when in the stadium and you are thirsty, you may buy a drink once for 6 EUR or more. But then you can do it like everybody in the stadium did. Refill your cup over the sink in the restrooms. This is literally Eau de Toilette, but far cheaper than paying so much for drinking.
After the much the stadium emptied quickly and the audience split up into smaller groups crawling through the many small streets around the stadium. It still was very warm and you can imagine that, when you are entering the crowded metro, air quality won’t improve.
Maybe one of the best known landmarks of Paris is the Eiffel Tower (Tour Eiffel). The tower was built for the world expo 1889 and wasn’t so popular among Paris’ inhabitants first. But over the first it became more and more popular and turned into a symbol for the city by the river Seine.
I went from Arc de Triomphe straight to the Eiffel Tower, crossing a bridge and while walking it wasn’t difficult to spot the tower once you are now longer on a street lined by high but beautiful buildings (a.o. the Yves Saint Laurent Museum).
Before I left town for my trip I have already booked tickets to get onto the Eiffel Tower. You can choose between the first, second, or third level, between stairs and lift. And be aware: when I have been in Paris you could only book tickets for the top online and it was recommended to buy tickets in general on the Eiffel Tower page. The first impression however was some kind of disappointment, because the tower’s area is surrounded by walls. It’s not like you can easily go from one side to the other by just walking under the tower. You need to go through security checks and it’s recommended not to bring large backpacks or even strollers.
But before I went around the tower and — be aware — there are young ladies trying to get your data (signature, address etc.) for — as they say — deaf people. I told them that I don’t sign but that I will donate once back home. Well, the lady who I was talking to tried to push me. No chance. My advice: don’t sign anything.
After the security check it was time to get up. As sporty as I am I took the stairs to make it to the second level. However, I forgot that I don’t always feel good in higher altitudes, though you had grid structure and (hand)railers everywhere, it was like “oh no, next time I take the lift.” But it’s worth it. The view is awesome and just thinking about the achievements of engineers and workers in the 1880s leaves you with awe. Also leaving you with awe are the prices if you buy something to drink. As you can imagine, taking up something to drink is not allowed. A little smoothie bottle then was expensive. Let’s not talk about the prices.
I took the stairs for the second floor. And It’s unbelievable what you can see. You can see a Paris that — despite of La Defense — is not crowded with skyscrapers, but almost “flat”. And you can spot all the different arrondisments, the mixture of old and modern architecture. Sous le ciel de Paris… You can spot Sacre Coeur, you can look over the roofs of the buildings that have witnessed centuries of history.
Back on the ground I crossed the Pont d’Iéna bridge and went to Trocadéro. Though not really understanding what Trocadéro really is, a castle, originally a museum, was it nice to have a look at the Eiffel Tower again. But it was finally time to return to the hotel and to grab my bag. I still had destinations to visit.
I wanted to visit Montmarte, Sacre Coeur, and eat in a French restaurant again. And I decided to visit a Breton restaurant, La Cantine Bretonne in the 19th Arrondisment.
As usual, first it was a bit complicated to order some food without proper French, but the gentleman did his best to communicate with me in English and I did my best to speak French. Voila, it worked. And I promise to come back with better French skills.
The urban environment between the restaurant and the Stalingrad metro station (no joke, the station’s name really is Stalingrad) is beautiful. Urban art in many places, little parks and you can walk aside a bassin. And because it was the day of the Rugby World Cup opening you saw groups of French people everywhere, wearing the jerseys of their team. And me, wearing the jersey of France’s national soccer team, was expected to cheer. The reaction was funny when I told the people that I don’t understand most of their sentences and that I am from Germany. But I guess they liked to see that — looking back in our history — somebody from Germany cheers for le grande nation.
After reaching the bassin’s end — I wouldn’t be surprised if Paris would use it for some kind of competition — I entered the metro in Stalingrad again and went straight to Sacre Coeur.
My former neighbors told me that Sacre Coeur and Montmartre are beautiful spots in Paris. When you leave the metro and reach the surface again you will very soon spot a crowded, busy street with lots of tourist shops selling mostly the same stuff. I didn’t buy it as I didn’t want to look like a tourist.
At the end of the street you can spot the famous Basilique du Sacré-Cœur de Montmartre. The basilica was built in 1914 and lies directly to Montmarte, a famous quarter for artists.
Going up the stairs (there’s also a lift) you come across some street vendors. Be aware of the ones who start tying a cord around your arm. They don’t stop and ask you for “paper money”. I was so lucky that I didn’t have any paper money with me.
I didn’t go inside Sacre Coeur. Instead I went to Montmartre (if you view the image of the basilica above again, it’s on the left on the image). First, you will see narrow side streets with smaller than usual houses built in another century. Second, you will recognize that today’s tourism has taken over Montmartre. It wasn’t what I expected, a district or quarter for independent artists, but mostly a beautiful quarter that was filled by stores selling almost the same stuff that I saw in the street when I left the metro station. It’s a pity, because I can imagine that in the past this little piece of Paris was indeed inspiring for artists from around the world.
But I liked the view on Paris. Did this spot look not that high when standing on the second floor of the Eiffel Tower, I then got another look and saw the roofs of Paris again.
After the trip to Montmartre I wanted to go back to the center of Paris. With Paris’ good public transport I arrived at La Nation. I was already curious where the station is — where in Paris. The station was decorated with photographies and stories from France’s successes in sports (mostly soccer I’d guess), so I thought it’s somewhere near a stadium or the headquarters of the French Football Federation. But no, I was totatlly wrong. La Nation, the name came from the woman leading the masses, the revolution on a famous painting. It was the young, blonde woman with the red cap.
La Nation’s statue was located inside a park inside a huge roundabout. People gathered there to relax, play, listening to music, and to exercise.
With no real destination in my mind I was walking around, exploring the streets and alleys of Paris at dusk. It was a nice play between dimming sunlight and shadows and seeing people getting ready for the weekend.
Paris is a large city, a big city, but wherever you are, it felt like home everywhere. It wasn’t like Berlin, Dubai, or Moscow where you are walking around and people are living for themselves. No, here, that was my feeling, people are a community in every street.
And the city is very diverse. You find Asians, Africans, Arabs, you see Hindhi, Jews, Muslims, and Christians.
After some kilometers I wanted to find a place to sit and to eat. Bars were already crowded, some advertised that they have airconditioning. I thought it would be a nice idea to watch some rugby with the French, or people from New Zealand who’d play against France tonight.
I picked Le Bastille, a restaurant directly at the Place de la Bastille and ordered my first ever Cesar’s Salad. Tasty. I was just surprised by the price of the meal in comparison to what I have paid for my order at Le Vin Coeur at the Arc de Triomphe. Anyway, it was great and I enjoyed the evening and the chance to sit.
The day of my departure has come. And it meant that at least I wanted to see some locations on my list before I leave. It was a good choice to pick Flixbus, because the bus would depart at 10pm, so that I could still spend the day in Paris.
I had to check out before 12pm and my idea was to leave early so that I can walk while its not that hot. And it was time to walk — marcher — straight to Nogent. Why? I wanted to see a place where you find something France is famous for and that is not the Eiffel Tower, not LVMH, no cheese. No, it was la Légion Étrangère, the French Foreign Legion.
The Legion is known for hard, rigorous training, home to those who leave life and past behind them. This is the romantic description of an elite unit that accepts foreigners to serve in the French military. Those who do this have to train hard (two-day Kepi march, between 60 and 80 kilometers) and quickly learn French. The Legion is about determination.
When I stood in front of Fort de Nogent in Nogent sur Marne, I was in awe. Though a high, ancient wall stood between me and the fort, I was able to hear somebody who probably was a drill sergeant shouting. Two or three times les ports opened and cars left. I sat there for a couple of minutes, packed with a sports bag and a backpack, wearing only my black shorts and a shirt. Some local residents passed by. How many young men have they seen who joined or wanted to join the legion? Did they think I wanted to join?
Before I left a gentleman left the fort. Out of curiosity I’ve asked him if he’s a Legionnaire. He wasn’t, but he was a regular French military servicemen (L’Armée de Terre). We soon have recognized that talking was a bit complicated, because his English was barely existent and my French wasn’t sufficient yet. But: Google is your friend. We picked our smartphones and began to write our texts into Google Translate. It was helpful and better than talking with hand signs.
Returning to the station Nogent sur Marne, I was thinking about the Code d’Honneur, the Honor Code and it’s meaning.
Chaque légionnaire est ton frère d’arme, quelle que soit sa nationalité, sa race, sa religion. Tu lui manifestes toujours la solidarité étroite qui doit unir les membres d’une même famille.
Article 2 of the Code d’Honneur de Légionnaire
It means that legionnaires have to treat each other respectfully, like a family member, regardless of nationality, ethnicity (or race, if you want to call it so), or religion. And that they support each other.
The one point, “regardless of his religion” mattered when I arrived at my next location: the Great Mosque of Paris.
The Municipiality listed the Mosque among many places to cool off (‘It’s hot in Paris’, Paris je t’aime, accessed October 17, 2023).
And indeed, the Grande Mosquée de Paris in the 5th Arrondisment was a true beauty. It was a nice, bright place and you got free water from dispensers to cool down, so you could enjoy the ornaments everywhere, mosaics.
But the highlight was the courtyard with its green and blue. Just seeing it made you peaceful and relaxed. And the fountains allowed me to cool my hands and arms. I stood there for maybe half an hour before I left.
I went on, because I still had time to spend. I walked through les Jardins des Plants, a huge park at Seine River with a zoo included. In the park I was sitting for a while again. Carrying two bags in the head wasn’t comfortable. After a quick meal I went westward along the river and the Institut du Monde Arabe that was part of the prestigious Sorbonne University.
Crossing may previous route again, I saw four huge men wearing camo uniforms. I looked at the patches on their arms. Légion Étrangère. These soldiers were legionnaires. And they looked impressive. Huge, strong guys. Voluntarily you wouldn’t attack them, comparable to the police units that I have seen in Panama City.
I spent the rest of the day walking through the city and walked through a neighborhood that looked a bit like Chinatown in Paris. But I also saw the areas of Paris that weren’t so beautiful. But they were, they are the reality of Paris. Paris is not just luxury, not just landmarks, but also average people living day to day or living a normal life in a capital city.
It was time to return to Bercy. In the park I saw how tourists and homeless people shared access to water dispensers. The tourist needed water to brush his teeth, the homeless refilled the bottles with water before trying to sleep, and I washed my hands, cooled my wrists.
At the open-air gym young men exercised. Each already had a muscular torso. One saw me looking at the sixpack. I pointed at it and pulled up my shirt to show him my onepack. We both laughed. And my journey ended where it began. In Bercy Seine. And I hope to return one day. Paris is a beautiful city. Merci, Parisiens.

I’ve been to Paris twice — the first time I was in high school, so I don’t recall much of that trip, but I had the opportunity to visit the city again last month.
Though the layouts of the cities are different, Paris feels like European New York City to me. Paris is all angles — cobblestone roads crisscrossing pavement in front of stone buildings and foot bridges, not like the grid blocks of New York City. The Paris skyline spreads out more than up. Still, the sights and sounds of the cities are similar. Crowds bustle as car horns beep and the smell of garbage and smoke waft through the air.
I was fortunate to be in Paris during preparations for the Olympics. The Eiffel Tower boasted the Olympic rings, and down the steps leading from the Eiffel Tower to the Seine, a countdown clock told passerby the number of days, hours, and minutes until the Olympics and Paralympics begin. All around the city were banners with “Paris 2024” written across them and people setting up structures for different events.
While Paris isn’t among my favorite European cities, there are things to love about it. Here are four…

When my girlfriend and I visited Paris in January 2020, we noticed something more than pretty old buildings and romantic restaurants: It’s quite creepy at night.
Some districts in Paris are quite poor.
Our hotel was in such a neighborhood. I wouldn’t book a hotel room in that area again. But it was cheap.
Getting to our hotel was a struggle on its own. It was above a French pub, and it was full of drunk people who didn’t speak a word of English, and we needed to get our keys. In the end, the hotel owner opened a vague door somewhere, and we were able to get in.
And a side note you probably need to know: people scare me, a lot. I’m quite introverted — which doesn’t make these things easy at all.
That first night I got bothered by some pimp in the streets near the Moulin Rouge. The guy invited me to some shady-looking place. I declined friendly by pretending I didn’t speak any language at all.
I just wanted to get some McDonald’s.

I took my daughters (10 & 13) to Paris last week and we LOVED it! Parisians seem to prioritize life differently than Americans. They optimize for taste, beauty, relationships, and leisure, while we optimize for career and money. It was an entirely refreshing look at how to live and I am taking note. I thought I’d share a bit about my experience for those of you thinking of traveling to Paris soon.
Nothing else about Paris is more delightful than the food. Parisians take great pride in their food and in eating. My cousin, Nick, who has been living in the city for the past three years tells me that they have banned certain foods like high fructose corn syrup and meats from the US because they value taste and good ingredients. France is an agricultural state and a lot of what they serve is grown nearby. Croissants really do taste better in France and though there are many reasons for this, the local flour and artesian butter in France, which is much higher quality than most ingredients we get in the US, may be the reason they are so darn good.
The downside to food in Paris is that it is very expensive, except for the baked goods. We could stop into a boulangerie (bakery), buy six croissants or pain au chocolat, and spend around 10–12 Euros ($11-$13 USD). Whereas lunches or larger brunches would run the three of us around 70–80 Euros and up if we were in a tourist area or fancy restaurant. Dinners were almost always well over 100 Euros.
We had an amazing French dinner at a restaurant called Georges that sat at the top of the Centre Pompidou, Paris’ modern art museum. It had an amazing view, lots of outdoor seating, and food/drinks that were to die for! We did an entire French dining experience which started with cocktails, and an appetizer of escargot. Followed by a main course, a bottle of wine, dessert, and then digestifs (alcoholic beverages you sip after your meal to “cut through the grease”). I was a fan of everything except the digestifs.
We had many more leisurely cafe experiences in Paris as well. You really can’t beat an open air patio seat, a croissant, and some tea. We loved our experience at Les Deux Magots, a higher-priced stop, but one with some history. Hemingway and other artists / authors used to be regulars here.
I was nervous about communicating in Paris as my French is very limited. It turns out, I didn’t really need it. The French seem to appreciate a “bonjour” when you enter and “merci”. I even tried to order a few times in French. But, the reality is that your English will get you wherever you need to go.
We stayed in an AirBNB near the Saint Lazare train station and either used the trains or walked the entire time we were in Paris. The trains are wonderful and even on weekends always come within 5 minutes. Nick told us to avoid the buses as they typically run late. For the trains, you can get per-trip paper cards, day or week passes, or for 2 Euros you can purchase a plastic card that you can load up with several trips at once.
Paris has train zones, so take care to pay the proper fare if you are traveling between zones. We did not do that when we went to the La Défense Arena and got stuck for a second at the train station. If you’re headed to Versailles you can buy tickets specifically for Versailles at the various train stations that service that route.
Paris is a large city, so, while you can walk many places, when we chose to do that, by the end of the day we were very, very tired!
My least favorite thing about Paris was how crowded it got at the famous tourist sites. You need to purchase tickets ahead of time for almost anything you’d like to see. The Eiffel Tower sells tickets 60 days in advance. They come out at midnight Paris time and are gone in minutes. Versailles’ tickets are easier to get, but the palace gets so crowded inside, you can’t even move at times. Try to visit as early in the day as you can. The gardens outside are far more my style and offer enough space for everyone to enjoy!
You need to get Louvre tickets well in advance too. When we showed up last Monday for our 9am ticket slot, they weren’t letting anyone in due to a maintenance issue. They recommended we return in two hours. We chose to wait instead and an hour and 15 minutes later, we got in. Because so many people left the line, we were one of the first inside and got a front-row spot to see the Mona Lisa. That was rad!
You would do well to purchase Arc de Triomphe and Catacombes tickets early too. The Catacombes allows you to buy tickets just seven days in advance and they sell out within minutes as well. I had read that you don’t need to buy Arc de Triomphe tickets ahead of time, but the line to the top when we arrived was a mile long. We ended up skipping it.
The parks in town are a much-needed (literal) breath of fresh air. They’re still covered with people, but you don’t need timed tickets and you still get some space to enjoy the outdoors at your leisure. Each park, from the Jardin des Tuileries to the Jardin du Luxembourg to the gardens outside Versailles Palace are impeccably landscaped and stunning. They are all well-worth a visit.
I can’t imagine what the crowds are going to be like this summer during the Olympics. After all, May is supposed to be a shoulder season for Paris and I felt like we were always packed into attractions like sardines. Throughout the city, they’ve set-up temporary stands and venues so you’ll see those everywhere this summer. Some of them are blocking off key views. We couldn’t see through the Jardin des Tuileries to the Louvre like you typically can, for example.
We stayed in a typical Paris apartment with a view into the inner courtyard. It was really small with a loft that my 10-year-old couldn’t even stand up in. But, Nick told us that it was actually quite spacious for the city. His apartment, he said, is smaller. It was comfortable too. The appliances were easy to use and the water stayed warm for a couple of showers, then got cold. I’m guessing that is pretty typical too.
Shopping is not our thing, but it’s a pastime that many tourists and Parisians really enjoy. You can buy any luxury item you want on the Champs-Élysées or in the smaller department store boutiques like Samaritaine. You can also go second-hand shopping in a number of places. We had a lot of fun in this shop on our last day as we were hiding from the rain.
All-in-all, we loved our petit Parisian girls’ weekend and would 100% go back. Next time, I will spend all of my time strolling through the streets, visiting the gardens, and, of course, eating!

I know this sounds crazy, but, to me, traveling is more than snapping a few photos of iconic sites. It’s a chance to ditch the crowds and authentically connect to the people and culture of a new place.
That’s why, for my upcoming trip to Paris, I’m not staying near the tourist traps in the Left Bank or Right Bank. No, I’m going to rent a cute little place way off the beaten path near a regular old bank with a name like, La Banque de Paris.
Down the street will be a charming little café run by a woman named Françoise. Each morning, I will sit at the same table and flip through a copy of Le Monde while sipping my café au lait. When Françoise asks if I am Parisian and I tell her I am not, she will say, “Mon Dieu! But you read the local newspaper here every morning like a Parisian!” And I will shoot her a wry smile and say, “Trompe l’oeil, madame.” And we will laugh and then exchange handwritten correspondence for the rest of our lives.
Later, skirting the crowds at the Pompidou, I will pick a street completely at random and walk door-to-door until I find a kindly elderly couple who will invite me in to flip through old newspaper clippings and reminisce about post-war Paris: the misery of the forties, the renaissance of the fifties, De…

**A Day in Paris: The City of Lights**
Paris woke up slowly, bathed in the soft light of the early morning sun. The streets of Montmartre, quiet at dawn, were beginning to stir with life. I had always dreamed of visiting the city of lights, and now that I was finally here, it felt like I had stepped into a painting. The cobblestone streets, the quaint cafés, and the iconic rooftops made Paris feel like something out of a dream.
I started my day at a small café near Sacré-Cœur, where I ordered a café au lait and a croissant. The smell of fresh coffee and baked pastries filled the air as I sat outside, watching the city wake up. Locals passed by with their morning papers, while tourists, like me, admired the charm of Montmartre. The calm, easy pace of life here was a welcome change from the rush of daily life.
After breakfast, I made my way up the hill to the Basilica of Sacré-Cœur. The view from the top was breathtaking. From there, the entire city stretched out before me, the Eiffel Tower standing tall in the distance. Paris seemed endless, and for a moment, I felt like I could stay there forever, gazing at the city below. The charm of Paris wasn’t just in its monuments, but in the little details — the flower-filled balconies, the narrow alleyways, the gentle murmur of life.
The morning was still young, and I decided to explore the artistic heart of Montmartre. Place du Tertre, with its lively atmosphere, was a haven for artists and performers. Painters lined the square, their easels set up, capturing the essence of Paris with each brushstroke. I watched in awe as they created masterpieces in minutes, bringing the city to life on canvas.
By midday, I wandered down to the banks of the Seine River. The sun was high in the sky, and the reflections of the bridges and boats on the water shimmered like magic. Walking along the Seine, I felt like I was part of a story one where love, art, and history intertwined seamlessly. The street vendors, selling old books and vintage posters, added a touch of nostalgia to the walk.
For lunch, I stopped at a cosy bistro in the Latin Quarter. The lively atmosphere was contagious as students, locals, and tourists filled the streets. I ordered steak frites and a glass of wine, savouring the rich flavours of French cuisine. With his charming French accent, the waiter made the experience even more memorable. It was the kind of meal that made you want to linger, soaking in the ambience of the city.
After lunch, I visited the Musée d’Orsay, an art lover’s paradise. Housed in a former railway station, the museum’s collection of Impressionist art was astounding. Standing before works by Monet, Renoir, and Van Gogh, I felt a deep connection to the artists who had captured the soul of Paris with their strokes of colour and light. Each painting told a story, one that felt timeless.
As the day turned to evening, I made my way to the Eiffel Tower. Watching the sunset from the Champ de Mars was a surreal experience. The sky turned pink and orange as the Eiffel Tower lit up, sparkling like the jewel of Paris. I sat there, taking it all in the beauty, the romance, the magic of the city.
Paris had a way of making you feel alive. Its streets, art, food, and history wrapped around you like a warm embrace. As I walked back to my hotel that night, I knew this day would stay with me forever — a perfect memory of a perfect day in the City of Lights.

Paris is such an interesting city, ask your friends that have been and you’ll likely get one of two responses — they either love it or think it’s the most overrated place ever, dirty and overpriced.
The only other cities that seem to instantly elicit such strong feelings are London and New York, and interestingly all 3 places do have a similar vibe and fast paced beat to life about them. But back to Paris, I feel like it goes through cycles of different representation, both negative and positive, from iconic movies like Amelie, the more recent Midnight in Paris and even more recently, the runaway Netflix hit Emily in Paris.
But with shows like Emily in Paris, while great for more exposure for the city, definitely add to this unrealistic, romanticized view of Paris that a lifelong Parisian probably laughs at, before taking a puff of their cigarette (because seriously the French love to smoke). And here lies the problem, not just in recent years but with decades of Hollywood and French cinema painting this idealistic picture of Paris, it will never live up to the image that people may have in their mind of the place.
My last trip to Paris was in 2022, making it my 2nd time there (I’m definitely due a return trip) and I did quite enjoy it, knowing the places to go, what I wanted to see and the reputation of the city, for better or worse and I think you need to take Paris with a grain of salt. Is it a filthy, rat ridden city? Well not really, if you go out of the city centre, into the arrondisements that make up the outer Paris suburbs, you’ll find areas are a bit more run down for sure but that’s same with pretty much any major capital city. In fact, I don’t find Paris much noticeably dirtier than London, which itself can get a bit grim in parts of greater London as well as notoriously in central London in places like Soho and Kings Cross (which has improved in recent years).
While didn’t really interact much with Parisians going about their days but when I had to, to ask for directions or advise on travelling, people were to the point and helpful. I’d say that Parisians are blunt and to the point, a generally French mannerism — they’ll tell you what you think, rather than smile at you and tell you a lie as may be more common in places like Britain and the USA. This way of being more straight up with communicating feels foreign and ‘rude’ if you’re coming from a more openly friendly and passive aggressive country but I still don’t feel that it’s inherent rudeness.
The locals may not being winning any competitions for being friendly, but in truth a lot of people in major cities are busy and don’t necessarily want to stop to talk to a tourist, and if you’re commuting on a normal week in your city you probably feel the same. The always on, busy life of Parisians did come across to me but this was also because it was summer. And cafés everywhere were full with people chatting away and enjoying their time outside and smoking, as the French do.
“The historical feel to the city feels well preserved”
I will also say that Paris is stunning, the roads around the centre are wide, with very symmetrical streets and the city itself feels like it was designed to deliberately look appealing. From the Parisian buildings with their stand out facades and windows to the trees dotting the streets, everything feels very ordered and clean — to me at least. And iconic places like the Louvre just highlight the cities fantastic design. There’s a simplicity about Paris in the centre and in a word it’s charming, without massive skyscrapers (which is by design), huge bridges or weirdly shaped buildings designed by quirky architects, there’s a pleasant uniformity to its skyline and the historical feeling to the city feels well preserved.
Paris and Parisians are actually quite social, it seems to be a thing in Paris/France generally to sit outside in nice weather for lunch, meet at a cafe and for dinner and so on, big meals with big groups seems the norm and it’s a great way to unwind at the weekend or in the evenings. And another thing I do like about Paris is getting around, the metro is relatively cheap, mostly on time and crowded like any underground subway system, but I do think it competes with the Tube in London for basic efficiency, and with mobile data on all lines.
You can zip around Paris fairly quickly on the Metro if you know your way around it and due to the city centre being not that big either, travelling doesn’t take too long, and if you’re feeling adventurous you could see 3 or 4 major sights in a day. Though you should avoid taking Ubers there, unless you plan to spend a fortune.
Paris of course has some a lot of history, and history nerds like myself love to see sights like the Bastille, Sacre Cour, Arc de Triomphe and of course the Eiffel Tower, though these can all be enjoyed by anyone travelling there. But aside from the major sights, there’s a bustling arts and fashion scene, with some cool art galleries, exhibits and museums dotted around the city. Emily in Paris is a slightly exaggerated depiction of a socialite-adjacent experience in the city but I will say that there does always seems to be something going on.
All in all, Paris is a city with a lot going for it, some people will be lukewarm on it but most will love or hate it, but I feel in the most Paris way possible, I imagine the city shrugging its shoulders and carrying on, remaining one of the most visited cities in the world and for reasons named above. No, it doesn't need mine or anyone's approval but I’ll give it a shoutout anyway, so c’est la vie!

It’s going to be a little bit weird for some of you. But we’re going to talk about some…fun stuff. I know, you’re recoiling in horror. Help! Mom!!! Umair’s being nice!!
If you haven’t already, join us over at The Issue for the Serious Stuff, if you want to understand the future, climate change, the economy, why the world’s melting down.
Every decade or so, the title of world’s coolest city changes hands. That’s sort of a rule, given the currents of culture and the tides of economics.
Today, Paris is the world’s coolest city. I know, I know, you might protest, and say, Paris has always been cool. Sure, it has. So you can add: again, if you like to that. Way back when, Art Nouveau exploded across its avenues, and of course, you can still take all that in today. Paris has always been many things: the world’s most literate, sophisticated, enlightened city. But “coolest”…I mean in…a slightly different way.
In modernish times, the world’s coolest city has shifted and changed. In the 2000s, it was a toss-up between London and maybe Tokyo. London was the pulsing epicenter of global creativity and culture, from music to literature to film…

I have been living in Paris for two years. As I moved from the end of my studies to the beginning of my career, I was able to meet Parisians of all ages.
I saw the Eiffel Tower every day on my morning bus ride to work. Even if I should have been used to the scenery after living there for so long, I never did. The Eiffel Tower is as beautiful as the day I arrived here. Many foreigners dream of living in the world’s most visited and romanticized city. On the other hand, so many tourists express their disappointment once they arrive in Paris. In France, Parisians have a bad reputation for being…rude. But what’s the reality? What’s the real Paris like? What’s romantic about the city, and what’s disappointing?
My first moment of happiness of the day is when I leave the house to go to work. At this time, the sun isn’t even up yet.
Parisian streetlamps light up the city, and there’s no one in sight besides me and the garbage collectors who are starting their day of work. Even with the garbage trucks passing by in the early morning, I consider it breathtakingly calm compared to Paris in the daytime…

Paris is the city of the dead.Spirits sprout in spring from tombstone-houses,bland as dogwood blossoms, drifting likepunch-drunk dandelions in their linens.
The limestone here that every street is lined withreminds me of the gaping quarry holesback home, like long forgotten mossy molars.But mostly they remind me of the flower-painted graves on Independence Day.
Now I understand why it’s so lovely here — why folks who worship Antoinette and prayto posters portraying Van Gogh’s madness wantto gamble off their lives and die in Paris.
One day when some other life flies byto see what wreck we’ve made of this fine Earth,out of all the cities strung acrossthe seven continents, they’ll say that Parishas to be the place we made our stand — where we realized it was over, and wherewe buried ourselves, our hopes, and our dreams.And isn’t that a work of art worth dying for?
Meanwhile, the immortal garçons will smokememorial pillars made of phoenix feathersoutside of Le Café des Musées of Us,looking so distracted, but waiting forsome other sainted tourist to pierce the skyand settle down outside to waste their time.

“Paris is more than a beautiful city… it’s a story.” Chills. When our tour guide shared that, in response to why he will never leave Paris, I knew I’d always remember that sentence. You always hear “Paris is the city of love” — but I like his definition better. It truly is a story.
We spent 4 days in Paris + it wasn’t nearly enough. But it was enough to make me fall in love with the city, + desire to go back for 1 month [at least!] to explore every single district [arrondissement] of Paris. They all have such unique characteristics — check out this post on the vibe of the different districts.
If I were to do it over again, I would have mapped out our days to encompass 1–3 districts every day… *including* a walking tour [if possible!], so that I would be able to get to know as many districts as possible. There’s so much to see! I labeled the districts, so it would be easy for you to see what’s closest to you!
#1] Noir: Hands down the best coffee shop we went to. [8]
#2] Leandres: Loved the vibe of this cafe… so cute! It was also next to an Acai & You, so you can grab coffee + then an acai bowl! [9]
#3] The Cafeotheque Of Paris: Apparently this coffee shop started the “artisan coffee movement” in Paris. It had so, so many options [one of the only cafes that had iced coffee that we saw]. Grab a coffee to go + the head across the river to Ile Saint-Louis to wander the streets… such a cute little area! [4]
#4] Le Peloton: Cute coffee shop in my fav neighborhood hat also offers bike rentals, + does bike tours! Close by is a popsicle shop, La Paleteria that I loved. [4]
#5] Cafe De Flore: The most famous French cafe in Paris. We didn’t go, but wanted to include this as it’s one of the oldest coffee shops in Paris, well known for being the “hang out spot” for high profile writers, philosophers, + creatives of the time. Visit for the history + fun for people watching. [6] *Other “famous” Paris spots are Laduree [macroons] + Angelina [hot chocolate]
#6] Partage Cafe: We stopped in here on our way to the Eiffel Tower to grab a quick bite + coffee, + it was the perfect treat. [15]
#7] … honestly go into any bakery ; ). Get a croissant, baguette, quiche, or whatever looks good to you! There are so many incredible bakeries — on every corner!
For next time: Fresh Bagel + Juice [11], Acai & You [9 + 11], Jozi Cafe [5], Good News Coffee Shop [15], Zia [7], Soul Kitchen [18], Bleu Olive [7], Fringe [3], Komborebi [9], Grainette [9]
#1] Terra: Our favorite meal in Paris! Beautiful space + amazing grilled meal. All of their entrees are for two people to share![3]
#2] Marso & Co: Loved this trendy mediterranean restaurant, + the owner Ludo was *so* nice. So many incredible flavors. [13]
#3] Ya Bayte by Hebe: Lebanese takeaway restaurant. Go here for lunch + then sit on the river! [5]
#4] Veggie Tasty: Vegan bowls + wraps. Great if you are in the area + want something healthy + tasty! [9]
#5] Les Epiciers: Loved this wine + cheese bar! One of the best chaucerte spreads I’ve ever had — with *warm* bread! YUM. [3]
For next time: Ev Brochettes + Mezzes [5], Green Deli [5], Balls [11], Today Tomorrow [Vegan, 11], B.BETTER [Vegan, 4], Numero 220 [Veg, 5], L’en K [5], Sol Semilla [Vegan, 10], Chantoiseau [18], Restaurant CHANG [1]
#1] My new fav french word is flâner — meaning “to stroll”, get lost + wander around for the sake of simply enjoyment. This is essential to do in Paris!
#2] Siam Spa [14]: Loved this thai massage spa! I also really wanted to check out Spa & Hammam [5], it’s a spa + tea house just for women!
#3] Picnic in all the gardens + parks. Need I say more ; )
#4] Go on biking tour! We absolutely loved our biking tour — Paris’ Best Kept Secret. Highly recommend!
#5] Something to note — boutique fitness studios are hard to come by + apparently crazy expensive. One of our friends lives in Paris + that’s what she said!
#1] Eiffel Tower — obviously! Make it your first + last stop if you can! Try to see it at night when she sparkles : )
#2] Walk to the highest point of Paris, Saint-Pierre De Montmartre church at sunrise or sunset. On your way, check out the Wall Of Love — “I love you” is written in 250+ languages!
#3] Walk down every single street in Marais. This was my favorite district of Paris… so trendy, romantic, + tons of amazing boutiques/eats!
#4] Visit the Catacombs — get a ticket online prior to going!
#5] If you can make a trip to Versailles +/or Monet’s Garden… do it! Both are outside Paris, but absolutely incredible to see [+ relatively close!].
#5] Tours on tours on tours! Google “walking tours” in Paris based on what you what to see… you’ll be guaranteed to find plenty! Airbnb Experience also has a lot of fun tours.
#6] See how many of these 50 sites you can visit ; )
We stayed at Hotel Henriette, which was absolutely adorable + had great breakfast — but, if was far from our favorite areas]. It was close to the Latin Quarter though! Next time, I’d want to stay in Marais — just because that was my fav district!
#1] Don’t expect people to speak English. Download a tanslator app on your phone! I used the Google Translate app.
#2] Use public transportation! It’s so easy, + will take a lot less time than ubers/taxies [+ cheaper!] train.
#3] Check out HiP Paris — I loved exploring this blog all about Paris!
#4] Watch Midnight In Paris to get you in the mood prior to going [or during your trip!]. Such a feel good movie! + love seeing all the sites!
#5] Are any of these absolute musts? No! [Okay, other than Eiffel Tower lol that is a must in my book!] This is the first time I’ve probably said this in a wellness guide but it’s true… there’s *so* much to see in Paris + so many incredible spots. It really just depends on what area you are in!
Ugh, Paris is so alive + I LOVE IT! I’m ready to go back now! Did I miss any of your fav spots? Let me know!
xx

Like many people, Paris is somewhere I’ve always wanted to visit. The landmarks, the architecture, the ambiance, and that certain je ne sais quoi. So after returning from my Parisian debut, here I’ve busted 5 common misconceptions about Paris to convince you to finally book that trip in 2025.
Parisians have a rather harsh reputation for being aloof and often rude. But especially for someone practicing her A-Level French skills, the Parisians were kind and accepting. They responded in French as if I too were a Parisian, and kindly clarified in English when I didn’t understand, before resuming in French as if nothing had happened. For someone who’s always had a fear about speaking a foreign language among native speakers, it was a huge confidence boost.
And the magic of Paris isn’t lost on them. At the end of our first day in Paris, the irony was not lost on me that I had not yet seen the iconic symbol due to the thick fog overhanging the city. But, at the edge of the Tuileries my travelling companion noticed that the Eiffel Tower was behind me. I twisted and ran towards it as she emerged from the fog, twinkling elegantly. Nothing prepared me for seeing her for the first time — something inside me glowed. Two Parisian men had been walking behind me and stopped to revel in the magic I was experiencing. By the twinkle in their eyes, I knew they too were struck by her beauty.
Paris has a reputation of being dirty and for people urinating on the pavements. Of course, I travelled over New Year so on NYE especially there were some suspicious liquids sliding slowly down the sloped streets, some of which were definitely urine going by their unique odour. But for the most part, in terms of cleanliness, Paris is like any other major city. It was no dirtier than London or New York. And as is always the case, it depends which parts of the city you visit. I was staying in the 18th Arrondissement not far from the Gare du Nord, and there was definitely a lot more rubbish discarded there. But in the touristy areas like Montmartre, the Latin Quarter and the Champs-Elysees, it was noticeably cleaner.
It’s Paris, one of the most visited cities in the world, of course there will always be tourist traps. We were hungry in Montmartre so decided to eat in the Place du Tertre following a recommendation from a guide. The restaurant was packed, a good sign for any experienced traveller. But even experienced travellers can make mistakes. The moules were flavourless and frites stone cold, even after sending them back. The service was lacklustre: we had to fight to get the meal taken off the bill after sending it back to the kitchen a second time and refusing to eat it.
So lesson learned — ask for recommendations from local people, for places that they would eat and tourists would never go. Don’t be fooled by a packed restaurant, only eat there if the crowd is clearly local.
But one brand that had queues for good reason is Pierre Hermé. The famous macaron chain is worshipped for good reason. You can’t go wrong with their signature Mogador; a delightful symphony between milk chocolate and passionfruit. For the brave, try their ever changing seasonal macarons such as eglatine, fig and foie gras or honey and fir pepper.
As a Brit used to the ‘tap in tap out’ system of the London Underground, the Paris Metro seemed bureaucratic. But once you get your head around the tickets, it’s super simple.
Instead of just tapping your bank card you need a Navigo Pass. Of course there are still packs of regular tickets, but to save fishing around in your pocket and inevitably losing one, the Navigo Pass is the easiest option.
Whether you choose the physical version (think London Oyster Card) available for 2 euros at most metro stations, or the electronic one loaded into your apple wallet, it works like a ticket holding device. You buy tickets using the Navigo or BonjourRATP apps, and they automatically load onto your card. I was in Paris for 4 days and my pack of 10 tickets (cheaper than buying individually) lasted me perfectly.
Navigating any metro system is an art, but going from A to B in the Paris metro is an easy art to learn. There is no northbound, southbound nonsense and each platform only serves one direction and final destination: no confusing branching off. Helpfully, on the newer trains, the maps have LED dots which easily show where the train is, saving the hassle of scanning the map multiple times just to find that you’ve missed your stop.
As well as the traditional metro system, in Paris there are also RER trains which serve the suburbs. For travellers, they are a relatively cheap and easy option to get from the Paris Airports, notable Orly and CDG. It’s important to note that you need a separate ticket for these trains which need to go on a separate Navigo Pass. Moreover, only one such ticket can be loaded onto the pass at once — you can’t scan for multiple people!
Going up the Eiffel Tower: the non-negotiable. Yet I beg to differ. Sure, the panoramas from the top are nice, but the iconic skyline is missing — why, because you’re in it! Instead, go to Trocadero at dusk to see the majestic iron and steel structure twinkling for the first 5 minutes of every hour.
Of course the Louvre is a must. But with 16km of galleries, you’re not going to see everything in a lifetime, let alone a day. Make sure you get an early time slot, and arrive at least 40 minutes before hand to make sure you get inside on time. In terms of what to see, the Mona Lisa is a must, but brace yourself for the crowd. Other pieces of note are the Venus De Milo, Liberty Leading the People (right around the corner from the Mona Lisa) and the French Crown Jewels.
Notre Dame, only recently opened on the 8th December 2024 after the devastating fire in 2019 is also a must see. The craftmanship that has gone into rebuilding the cathedral is just breath taking. But again arrive early. We arrived at 10am with only a short wait, but by 11am the queue snaked around the whole square outside.

I recently returned from a two-week trip to Europe, and I obviously spent a lot of time observing pedestrian and bicycle culture and infrastructure. Rather than simply envy our neighbors across the pond for their walkable and bike-friendly cities and believe that we Yanks could never match their high active transportation mode shares, I was constantly thinking how I could translate my experiences and observations into on-the-ground change here in the U.S. I also realized that we have some progressive transportation infrastructure on our own soil to be proud of.
We first made the pilgrimage to Copenhagen — the Promised Land for many Americans in the bicycle/pedestrian profession… And it lived up to the hype! The comprehensive network of physically separated cycle tracks was incredible and refreshing, of course, but I was more impressed by how easy it was to walk around the city. Several of the major streets were actually pedestrianized, with motor vehicles prohibited. While some examples of this concept exist in the U.S. — including Santa Monica’s Third Street Promenade — they feel rather manufactured and not organic.
Even with the dreary weather, we were sad to leave the playground of Copenhagen. But Paris was awaiting us! I had a mental image of Paris as the small, charming town along the river that is shown in films and travel magazines. However, I was immediately made aware of the city’s sprawling size and wide, auto-clogged boulevards. In a way, I was reminded of my hometown of Los Angeles, except that Paris’s Metro system blankets the region. In a flip from my experience in Copenhagen, I had gone to Paris expecting a walker’s paradise, but instead saw a budding cycling haven. The city had already squeezed cycle tracks along many of the major boulevards, and the famous Vélib’ public bicycles were as common a sight as sidewalk cafés and baguettes. The bicycle network appears set up to help Parisians close the “first mile/last mile gap” that often exists in a trip using public transit. I would love to see Los Angeles and other U.S. cities with mass transit networks pursue a similar course.
Finally, we ended our vacation by hanging out in the pedestrian paradises that are old Spanish cities. Barcelona, our first stop, was seemingly built to make walking a pleasurable experience, with interesting side streets, promenades, and commercial districts around every corner. Barcelona and other Spanish cities like Granada and Toledo also make good use of shared streets, or woonerfs, to make streets safe in constrained neighborhoods.
Finally, the many plazas and parklets in Spain’s cities were a never-ending source of resting space and excellent people watching.
Although very different in many ways, Los Angeles can and should follow the lead of European cities by creating safe and pleasurable spaces for people to walk or bike and be outside enjoying our near-perfect weather. And I’m proud to say that the LA region is beginning to seriously take on that mission. Both Long Beach and Temple City now have cycle tracks. LA County Metro is planning a regional bike share program. And through the LA Department of Transportation’s People St. program, several plazas and parklets have been created or are planned for previously underused road space. I’m excited that our leaders are beginning to push for progressive changes to restore some balance to how we move around our own cities.

Paris is, perhaps, the most beautiful city in the world. This might seem almost too obvious to write given how widely acknowledged and thoroughly documented its beauty is. On one hand, that’s fair. It’s a magnificent city that enjoys near unanimous admiration from around the globe. More than 44 million people visited Paris in 2022, with nearly 20 million of those tourists coming from outside of France. Depending on what data you look at, this would be good for the 3rd or 4th most visited city in the world by international tourists. For those who aren’t able to make the journey to Paris, images of the city are seared into the minds of most people from an early age, serving as the de facto model of what a wonderful city should look like. Its bistros, baked goods, and culture have been exported world wide.
But you’ll have to excuse my writing out the obvious, and walking down already well trodden paths to explain the beauty of Paris, as I believe it extends far beyond what we’ve been told of it, or shown. I’d like to argue that Paris isn’t properly appreciated for all that it is, and I doubt that it ever could be. You might say this is just excitement talking, and that’s partly true — I’m still glowing from my recent quick trip…

When most tourists visit Paris, places like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and the Moulin Rouge are often on the itinerary. There’s nothing wrong with that — especially if it’s your first time in the City of Light. But, those of us who live here know that there is so much more to discover.
Many of those places can be found in one neighborhood in particular: the 11th arrondissement. Located to the east of the Seine River, it’s nestled between the Place de la Bastille, Père Lachaise, Belleville, and Place de la Nation. Lots of locals hang out in the 11th (read: good restaurants, few tourists) as opposed to, say, the 1st. The crowds are young, cool, and possess an actual je ne sais quoi that everyone’s always going on about.
Known amongst Parisians for its nightlife, concert venues, and restaurants, there is much to see and do in the onzième.
There are small quartiers (quarters) within every arrondissement in Paris. Don’t get confused just yet — it’s similar to the American practice of designating separate villages within certain cities or towns.
Let’s begin with the most well-known quarter of the 11th arrondissement: Bastille. Home to the Place de la Bastille, a square that once held the famous Bastille prison. Said prison was stormed on July 14, 1789, an event that would mark the official beginning of the 18th-century French Revolution, a topic that will get my fellow TAIP author Stephen going, if you’re up for a coffee or a whiskey.
Today there is a monument called the Colonne de Juillet in the center of the place. After you’ve admired it up close, turn to see the Opéra Bastille, but know that the opera house is technically in the 12th arrondissement.
From there I recommend heading to the Marché Bastille if it’s a Thursday or a Sunday — the market is open from 7am on both days. Take a shortcut through the picturesque cour Damoye to head to the rue de la Roquette. Continue to wander the small, winding cobblestone roads until you get lost.
When I was an au pair, Oberkampf was the place to go out. Drinks and food are cheap, there are a ton of young people, and there are several venues for live music. If that sounds like your vibe, head to the rue Oberkampf to start.
Keep your eyes peeled for street art as there is plenty of that in the area. The Bataclan is amazing for live shows — you likely recognize the name as it was unfortunately the target of a terrorist attack in 2015. Don’t let that keep you from buying tickets for a show. There is now a small memorial out front that’s dedicated to those who were lost if you’d like to pay your respects before you go inside.
My favorite Italian restaurant of all time is located in the Oberkampf area. It’s unassuming and very easy to miss and you must make a reservation if you hope to get in. No, it’s not the ultra-Instagram-famous Ober Mamma. It’s called L’Osteria Dell’Anima and the quality of the meals I’ve enjoyed there rivals actual Italian food I’ve eaten in Italy. Yes, it’s that good.
If you do want to go out and hit the town running, head to Oberkampf any time after 9pm and you’ll find students, au pairs, and other young people bar hopping. Follow the sound of laughter and the smell of cheap beer — you’re in the right place.
Charonne holds a special place in my heart. I spent a lot of time there with my now-husband when we first got together, as in a former life I frequently cleaned an Airbnb property there. It’s quaint, lively, and full of terraces that are perfect for people-watching.
It’s another Parisian neighborhood that’s made up mostly of locals. Duke, a café on the corner of rue de Charonne and Boulevard Voltaire, is located just outside the Charonne metro station and is a great option for coffee.
Le Palais de la Femme further down the street is a homeless shelter for women that often hosts large vintage sales and other indoor markets to raise money. Waly Fay on rue Godefroy Cavaignac is one of my favorite places for West African food in the city. Septime La Cave, just a few minutes away on rue Basfroi, is my go-to wine bar in the 11th. If you want to get fancy, you can go to the Michelin-starred Septime (same owners, different location), but keep in mind reservations are weeks out, so you can’t just rock up and hope to get a table.
On the other side of the Boulevard Voltaire there’s Comets, a café and vinyl store that I’ve spent many a rainy afternoon in. Bar Outland, on a small side street, specializes in beer on tap and natural wines — it’s a fun place for a first date.
When you’re done, continue to stroll down rue de Charonne until you reach the Père Lachaise, and officially cross the border into the 20th arrondissement, which is also full of sites to see. But, that’s another neighborhood for another blog article.

Some months ago, at the height of the transportation strikes, several well-meaning acquaintances messaged me with concern or asked on behalf of friends who were considering travel plans whether it was indeed safe to visit Paris.
These people didn’t need a speech from me, I thought. My safest answer was, “Yes; don’t believe everything you hear from the mainstream media, whose business is built on chaos.”
But by the third time I was asked, I blurted out, “The people asking this live in the country which must be the most dangerous one for children in the entire developed world.” My fellow Americans, blissfully self-absorbed and aloof from the world, wonder if it’s safe to travel to Paris, which was dealing with strikes and riots (nothing new, something I’ve experienced regularly since moving to France). Yet in America, children are regularly gunned down in classrooms and people are choked to death on subways or on routine traffic stops. Those things don’t happen in France.
My unsafe answer concluded, “It’s certainly safer to visit France than an American elementary school.”
Do the trite words of “Thoughts and prayers,” which automatically and thoughtlessly escape the lips of many of my fellow countrymen after every tragedy simultaneously obliterate their common sense to such a degree that they consider the glossy…

Paris! The city of lights, love, and a maze of delectable experiences just waiting to be discovered It’s a place where every cobblestone street tells a story of history, every café smells like freshly brewed coffee, and every corner reveals an architectural marvel that takes your breath away. This is a living, breathing work of art, not just a city. But don’t get carried away by Paris’ poetic allure just yet. We’re all here for a reason, aren’t we?
My fellow globetrotters, the goal of this blog post is to provide you with the best tips and tricks for exploring Paris like a seasoned traveler. Not the kind that just takes a selfie with the Eiffel Tower and leaves, but the kind that delves deep into the city’s soul, savors its flavors, and emerges with a heart full of stories.
“Why should I trust this guide?” you may be wondering. So, please allow me to introduce myself. I’m your friendly neighborhood world traveler, a culture connoisseur, a gastronome of global cuisines, and an adventurer who’s walked on every continent. I’ve had tea with Bedouins in the Sahara, tango danced in Buenos Aires, and hiked the Great Wall of China. But no matter where I go, I am always drawn back to Paris.
So strap in, because we’re about to take a virtual stroll through the streets of Paris. We’ll navigate the city’s intricate metro system, discover hidden gems tucked away in charming neighborhoods, savor the finest French cuisine, and even pick up a few etiquette tips. You’ll be ready to pack your bags and book your next flight to Paris by the end of this guide.
But keep in mind that this isn’t just about checking off items on a tourist checklist. It’s all about immersing yourself in the Parisian way of life, getting to know the city’s rhythm, and making memories to last a lifetime. So, are you ready to discover Paris’s wonders? Let’s get this party started!
Oh, the trip to Paris! It’s the first step in your epic journey, and it’s just as important as the destination. There are now several ways to get to the city of lights, each with its own unique charm and quirks. Let’s get into the specifics, shall we?
Flights are the most common mode of international transportation. Paris has two major airports: Charles de Gaulle, a bustling hub that welcomes flights from all over the world, and Orly, a quieter sibling that’s popular with European travelers. Here’s a pro tip from a seasoned traveler: If you’re flying from outside Europe, you’ll most likely land at Charles de Gaulle. However, if you need to connect within Europe, try to book it through Orly. It’s smaller, less crowded, and has a charm that larger airports frequently lack.
For those traveling within Europe, trains are the preferred mode of transportation. The French rail network is an engineering marvel, connecting Paris to major cities throughout the continent. Isn’t there something magical about sipping a cup of coffee while watching the French countryside fly by? If you’re in a hurry, take the TGV, France’s high-speed train, and you’ll be in Paris in no time.
Let us now discuss transactions. The golden rule of travel is to plan ahead. The earlier you book, the better the bargains. But here’s a secret: the best deals are sometimes found at the most unexpected times. Late-night flights, mid-week trains, and off-season seasons are your allies. Accept them, and your bank account will thank you.
Finally, keep in mind to check multiple booking platforms. Each has its own set of deals and discounts, and a little digging can go a long way. Skyscanner and Kayak are excellent flight search engines, while Trainline and SNCF are excellent train search engines.
That’s all there is to it. The journey to Paris, explained Remember that whether you choose to fly through the clouds or race across the countryside, the journey is just as important as the destination. After all, as the saying goes, a trip to Paris is always a good idea!
The sweet quandary of deciding where to hang your hat in Paris The city is teeming with lodgings of all kinds, each offering a distinct slice of Parisian life. But don’t worry, I’m here to help you navigate the maze of Parisian accommodations, from the grandest hotels to the coziest apartments.
Let’s start with the best of the best: the hotels. Some of the world’s most luxurious hotels can be found in Paris. Consider this: You’re relaxing in a luxurious suite with a view of the Seine, sipping champagne as the Eiffel Tower twinkles in the distance. Doesn’t it sound lovely? That is the allure of Parisian hotels. They are more than just places to sleep; they are experiences in and of themselves. The Ritz, the George V, and the Shangri-La are all names synonymous with luxury and opulence. But keep in mind that luxury comes at a cost. If you’re willing to splurge, these hotels provide an experience that is well worth the money.
But what if you’re looking for something a little less expensive? Enter hostels and low-cost hotels. These are the unsung heroes of Paris lodging. They may not provide champagne or river views, but they do provide something far more valuable: the opportunity to meet other travelers. Parisian hostels are known for their lively atmospheres and welcoming staff. They are places where you can share travel stories over a communal dinner, explore the city with new friends, and live like a local. What’s more, what’s the best part? They’re also inexpensive.
Apartments are now the way to go if you value privacy and want to live like a true Parisian. Paris is full of charming apartments that you can rent for your stay. Imagine waking up in your own Parisian apartment, brewing a cup of coffee in the kitchen, and watching the city come to life from your balcony. It’s a different kind of luxury, allowing you to explore the city on your own terms.
Let us now discuss location. Paris is divided into 20 districts, or arrondissements, each with its own distinct personality. The city’s heart, the 1st arrondissement, is home to iconic landmarks such as the Louvre and the Tuileries Garden. This is the place to be if you want to be right in the middle of things. If you prefer a quieter, more local atmosphere, head to the outer arrondissements. For example, the 20th arrondissement is known for its bohemian vibe and vibrant street art.
The price range is entirely dependent on what you’re looking for. A night in a luxury hotel can cost several hundred euros, whereas a bed in a hostel dorm can cost as little as 20 euros. Apartments fall somewhere in the middle, with prices varying according to size and location. My recommendation? Make and stick to a budget. In Paris, there is accommodation for every budget; you just need to find the one that is right for you.
So, my fellow travelers, there you have it. The decoded world of Parisian lodging Whether you choose to live in luxury, embrace the communal spirit of hostels, or appreciate the privacy of an apartment, keep in mind that your lodging is more than just a place to sleep. It’s your Parisian home, where you’ll unwind after a day of exploring, share meals with new friends, and fantasize about the adventures that await. If you make the right choice, your Parisian home will become a treasured part of your travel memories.
Getting around Paris, my friends, is an adventure in and of itself. The city’s public transportation system is intricately woven and connects every corner of the city, much like a giant spider web. It’s an architectural marvel, a testament to the city’s dedication to accessibility, and, if I may add, a joy to use.
Let us begin with the Metro, the backbone of Parisian public transportation. The Paris Metro is more than just a transportation system; it’s a part of the city’s identity, with its unmistakable Art Nouveau entrances and labyrinthine network of tunnels. It’s quick, efficient, and surprisingly simple to use once you get the hang of it. Each line is identified by a number and a color, with the name of the last station on the line indicating the direction of travel. So get a map, plan your route, and you’ll be zipping around town like a local in no time.
Then there are buses. While the Metro transports you underground, buses allow you to explore the city on the ground floor. They are slower than the Metro, but they provide a scenic route through the city. They’re also an excellent way to discover lesser-known neighborhoods and landmarks. Just remember to double-check the bus routes and schedules before boarding.
Then there are the bicycles. With dedicated bike lanes and bike-sharing programs like Vélib’, Paris is a bike-friendly city. Cycling through the city with the wind in your hair and the cityscape unfolding around you is incredibly liberating. It’s an experience I wholeheartedly recommend.
Now, for some pointers on how to get around efficiently, Get a Navigo card first. It is a reloadable card that can be used on the Metro, buses, and some Vélib’ stations. It will save you the trouble of purchasing tickets each time you travel. Second, if possible, avoid rush hour. During peak hours, the Metro and buses can become congested, so plan your journey accordingly. Finally, don’t be afraid to take a walk. Paris is a walkable city, and it is sometimes the best way to explore it.
That’s all there is to it. The ins and outs of getting around Paris Whether you travel by Metro, bus, bike, or on your own two feet, keep in mind that the journey is just as important as the destination. So, take your time, take in the sights, and let the city lead the way.
Paris, the city of love and lights, is a treasure trove of iconic attractions that have captivated travelers’ hearts for centuries. Each monument, each landmark, tells a story — a quintessentially Parisian story of history, art, and culture. Let’s take a tour of these must-see attractions, shall we?
The Eiffel Tower, or La Dame de Fer (The Iron Lady), as the French call it, is the symbol of Paris. With a height of 330 meters, this iron lattice tower provides a breathtaking panoramic view of the city. The Eiffel Tower is a sight to behold at any time of day, whether you choose to climb to the top or admire it from the ground. But there’s something magical about seeing it twinkle against the night sky, in my opinion.
The Louvre, the world’s largest art museum and a historic monument in Paris, is next on our list. It’s an art and history treasure trove, housing thousands of works from all over the world, including the enigmatic Mona Lisa. Walking through the Louvre is a journey through the annals of human civilization that is both enlightening and awe-inspiring.
The Notre-Dame Cathedral stands on an island in the Seine, not far from the Louvre. This French Gothic architectural masterpiece bears witness to the city’s rich religious history. Its intricate facades, towering spires, and breathtaking stained glass windows are breathtaking. And if you don’t mind a bit of a climb, the view from the top is well worth it.
Let us now discuss how to make the most of your visit to these top attractions. The key is to plan ahead. These attractions are popular for a reason, and they can become congested, particularly during peak tourist season. So, here are a few pointers to help you avoid the crowds and have a good time during your visit.
To begin, go early in the morning or late in the afternoon when there are fewer people. You’ll not only avoid the crowds, but you’ll also get to see these sights in a new light. Consider watching the sunrise from the top of the Eiffel Tower or admiring the Louvre’s glass pyramid as the sun sets. Doesn’t it sound lovely?
Second, consider purchasing tickets ahead of time. Many of these attractions provide online ticketing, which can save you a significant amount of time. Some even sell “skip-the-line” tickets that allow you to avoid the long lines.
Finally, take your time. These attractions are full of detail and history, and rushing through them would be a waste of time. Take your time, take in the details, and let the beauty of these sights wash over you.
So, fellow travelers, these are the top Paris attractions. They’re more than just sights to see; they’re experiences to cherish and memories to create. So pack your bags, put on your walking shoes, and prepare to discover the wonders of Paris. Best wishes!
Paris, the City of Lights, is a treasure trove of previously unknown treasures. Aside from the iconic Eiffel Tower and the magnificence of the Louvre, there is a world of lesser-known attractions that offer a truly unique and authentic Parisian experience. Let’s go on an off-the-beaten-path adventure, shall we?
The Père Lachaise Cemetery is in the 20th arrondissement of Paris. You might be wondering right now, “Is it a graveyard? Really?” But believe me when I say this isn’t your average cemetery. It’s a peaceful haven in the heart of the city, where history and peace coexist. Here, you can pay your respects to famous people such as Oscar Wilde and Edith Piaf while also getting lost in the maze of cobblestone paths and ancient tombs.
Next, let’s visit the city’s thriving street art scene in the 13th arrondissement. Local and international artists turn the streets into an open-air museum by painting on them. Don’t miss the BnF François-Mitterrand, which features stunning murals on its towering walls.
If you enjoy literature, go to Shakespeare and Company in the 5th arrondissement. This charming bookstore has been a haven for writers and book lovers since the 1950s. Browse the book shelves, go to a reading, or simply enjoy the literary atmosphere.
How do you go about discovering these buried treasures? The key is to keep an open mind and a keen eye. Don’t be afraid to deviate from the tourist trail and explore the city’s lesser-known neighborhoods. Insider information is best obtained from locals. Use social media and travel blogs to find recommendations. Above all, be open to the element of surprise. Some of the most fascinating discoveries occur when you least expect them.
Remember that finding these hidden treasures isn’t about crossing things off a list. It’s about being present in the moment, whether it’s the peaceful solitude of a cemetery, the vibrant colors of street art, or the cozy comfort of a bookstore. Allow the city to reveal its secrets to you as you take your time and enjoy the moment.
So, fellow travelers, are you ready to unearth Paris’s hidden treasures? The city awaits you, full of surprises and stories to discover. Have a great time exploring!
Paris, the world’s gastronomic capital, is a food and drink lover’s paradise. The city’s culinary scene is a delectable symphony of flavors that is as diverse as it is delicious. French cuisine is a culinary journey that will tantalize your taste buds, from the humble baguette to the decadent escargot.
Let’s start with the fundamentals, the foundation of French cuisine: bread. Bread is more than just food in Paris; it’s a way of life. The baguette, with its golden crust and soft interior, is a Parisian household staple. Combine it with some cheese for a simple yet satisfying meal. Not to mention the croissant, a buttery, flaky delight that goes perfectly with a cup of coffee.
When it comes to coffee, Parisians take it seriously. Coffee is an essential part of Parisian culture, whether it’s a quick espresso at the counter or a leisurely café crème at a sidewalk café. A hot chocolate at Angelina is also a must for those with a sweet tooth. It’s a chocolate lover’s dream come true — thick, creamy, and decadently rich.
Let us now explore the world of French cuisine. Escargot, foie gras, and coq au vin are just a few of the dishes that have put French cuisine on the map around the world. But French cuisine is more than just these classics. Each region and city has its own specialty. The steak-frites, a simple dish of steak and fries, is a testament to the culinary philosophy of Paris: quality ingredients cooked to perfection.
There’s also the wine. France is one of the world’s largest wine producers, and Paris is the ideal location to sample the country’s extensive wine selection. There is a wine for every palate, from the full-bodied reds of Bordeaux to the crisp whites of the Loire Valley.
So, where should you eat and drink in Paris? The city is teeming with cafes, restaurants, and bars, each with their own distinct charm and personality. Café de Flore in Saint-Germain-des-Prés offers a classic Parisian café experience. If you’re looking for a gourmet meal, Le Comptoir du Relais has a delectable menu of French classics. A visit to Le Baron Rouge wine bar is also recommended for wine enthusiasts.
But keep in mind that the best culinary experiences are frequently found in the most unexpected places. That little bakery might just have the best baguette you’ve ever had. That tiny bistro around the corner may have the best coq au vin. So don’t be afraid to venture out and try new things.
Finally, some words of wisdom. The experience of French cuisine is more than just the food and drink. It’s about the pleasure of sharing a meal, the art of conversation, and the pleasure of savoring each bite. So, when you’re in Paris, eat like a local. Take your time, enjoy the food, and let the culinary magic of the city enchant you.
Are you ready to embark on a culinary adventure in Paris, my fellow travelers? The city’s cafes, restaurants, and bars are waiting to tempt your taste buds and fill your heart with gastronomic delight.
When you enter Paris, you are not simply entering a city; you are entering a rich tapestry of culture and tradition that has been woven over centuries. The French, particularly Parisians, are known for their strict sense of etiquette and customs. Understanding these nuances will enhance your experience and enable you to navigate the city like a local.
Let us begin with greetings. The French are formal in their interactions, and it is customary to greet people with “Bonjour” (Good day) during the day or “Bonsoir” (Good evening) at night. A firm handshake is the norm when meeting someone for the first time. However, it is customary among friends to exchange a kiss on both cheeks, a practice known as “la bise.”
Let’s move on to dining etiquette. The French take their food seriously, and mealtimes are regarded as a time to unwind and socialize. Before beginning a meal, it is customary to say “Bon appétit.” Remember to keep your hands (but not your elbows) on the table and wait for the host to begin eating or toasting before you do. And, of course, take your time eating; rushing through a meal is considered impolite.
Another important aspect of French culture is language. While many Parisians speak English, they appreciate it when visitors attempt to communicate in French. A few simple phrases can go a long way toward demonstrating respect for the local culture. And if you have any questions, don’t be afraid to ask. The French are proud of their culture and enjoy sharing it with others.
Parisians are known for their fashion sense when it comes to dressing. They dress more formally than residents of many other cities. While there is no strict dress code, it is best to dress neatly and modestly when visiting churches or other religious sites.
Finally, in France, punctuality is viewed differently. While being a few minutes late is usually not a big deal, it’s polite to call and notify someone if you’re going to be late.
Here are some suggestions for how to respect the local culture. First, pay attention. Take note of how the locals act and follow their example. Second, be courteous. Recognize the importance of customs and traditions to the French and respect them, even if they differ from your own. Third, keep an open mind. Accept the differences and relish the opportunity to learn about a new culture.
Remember that traveling is more than just seeing new places; it is also about experiencing new cultures. You’re not just being a responsible traveler when you understand and respect French customs and etiquette; you’re immersing yourself in the French way of life. And who knows what else? You might fall in love with the Parisian way of life, just like I did.
As you prepare to explore the wonders of Paris, remember to bring not only your suitcase but also your sense of etiquette. Respect the local culture, embrace the Parisian way of life, and allow the city of lights to warmly welcome you. Best wishes!
To ensure a safe and enjoyable visit to Paris, as with any major city, a certain level of awareness and precaution is required. While the city is generally safe, it is always a good idea to be prepared and informed about potential hazards and how to deal with them.
Pickpocketing is a common problem for travelers, especially in crowded tourist areas and on public transportation. Always keep an eye on your belongings to avoid becoming a victim of such incidents. Use bags that close securely and stay in your line of sight. Displaying expensive items, such as jewelry or high-end electronics, may draw unwanted attention.
Another piece of advice is to exercise caution when exploring the city at night. While Paris is famous for its vibrant nightlife, some areas can be dangerous after dark. Avoid walking alone in unfamiliar areas and stick to well-lit, busy streets. Using a reputable taxi service or rideshare app for late-night transportation can be a safer option.
It is critical to know who to contact in the event of an emergency. In France, the general emergency number is 112, which can be dialed for any type of emergency. You can dial 15 for medical emergencies only. The number to dial if you need the police is 17. It’s a good idea to save these phone numbers before your trip.
Finally, keep a physical and digital copy of all important documents, such as your passport and travel insurance. In the event of loss or theft, having these copies on hand can speed up the replacement process.
Remember that safety does not happen by chance. It is the result of careful planning and sound decision-making. So, as you take in the sights and sounds of Paris, keep these safety precautions in mind. They’ll make sure your memories of the city are nothing but positive.
As we conclude this guide, take a moment to reflect on the journey we’ve taken together. We’ve waded through the intricate web of Parisian public transportation, discovered hidden gems tucked away in charming neighborhoods, savored the flavors of French cuisine, and immersed ourselves in the city’s rich culture and etiquette. We’ve learned how to make the most of our Parisian adventure by exploring the city from the ground up, from the iconic Eiffel Tower to the bustling local cafes.
Paris is a city that promises an unforgettable experience with its blend of history, culture, and modernity. It’s a city that begs you to explore, discover, taste, and fall in love with it. So, dear travelers, I urge you to take the leap of faith. Pack your belongings, put on your walking shoes, and allow Paris to sweep you off your feet.
Here are some additional resources to help you on your journey: The Paris Tourist Office’s official website (www.parisinfo.com) is a wealth of information, ranging from upcoming events to practical advice. The RATP website and app for public transportation provide real-time updates and route planning services. For foodies, the Michelin Guide is your go-to guide for the best dining experiences in town.
And, of course, this is only the beginning. Paris is a city that is always changing, and there is always something new to discover. So, dear readers, I invite you to share your own advice and experiences. Your contributions and stories are what make this guide truly comprehensive.
If you’ve got the travel bug and aren’t sure where to go next, how about Rome? With its ancient ruins, stunning architecture, and delectable cuisine, the Eternal City rivals Paris for a one-of-a-kind experience. It’s a city that, like Paris, combines the old and the new in a distinctively unique harmony.
https://medium.com/@lonestarglitztravel/when-in-rome-getting-lost-and-found-in-the-eternal-city-8f86e2807f7
So there you have it: a comprehensive guide to discovering Paris’s wonders. But keep in mind that the true magic of travel is found not in the destination but in the journey. It’s in the excitement of stepping off a plane in a new city, the delight of trying a new dish, the awe of standing in front of a historical monument, and the connections you make along the way. So go forth and explore, because the world is a book, and those who do not travel only read a page. Best wishes!

On a sunny Spring afternoon, UCL Postgrad Urbanists went on a book walk through Regent’s Park discussing Edward Chisholm’s A Waiter in Paris (2021).
We were joined by PhD researchers across UCL departments including Geography, The Bartlett School of Architecture, Institute of Education, and Engineering. In this piece, Postgrad Urbanists Sidra Ahmed (PhD, UCL Geography) and Yichang Sun (PhD, UCL The Bartlett School of Architecture) share reflections from the walk and a post-walk Q&A we had with the author Edward Chisholm.
The Book Walk
A Waiter in Paris is Chisholm’s memoir of his seven years in Paris. It opens with Chisholm as an English graduate in Paris with little to no prospects and hardly any money, but the guts to wait it out and figure out what Paris has in store for him. The book is an underdog narrative that follows an English waiter, (or rather, ‘waiter-in-waiting’ who starts out as a restaurant runner), experiencing Paris via the stage of the fictional ‘Le Bistrot de La Seine’ restaurant and its backstage gang of waiters, cooks, and management.
We’re taken on Chisholm’s story from passing as a waiter barely speaking French, navigating the kitchen politics of Le Bistrot de La Seine, to yes, becoming a waiter. Through Chisholm’s observations, we encounter a Paris that is dynamic, multifaceted, and deeply human. Below we share a few highlights from our discussion during the walk.
We opened the book walk by asking everyone to share moments in the book which were amusing. Our favourites include a moment when Chisholm, as a runner at that time, figures out how to manipulate the waiter politics to finally earn tips in the chapter ‘The Rise of the Runner’ and avenge the stealing of his tips from a previous shift:
“The role of the runner, it turns out, is a corrupt one. This is my source of prestige, I realize. If the waiters are bounty hunters, constantly chasing tips, then the runner is a mercenary, a gun for hire, His allegiances are to no one, only the person who pays him best. The waiters know that, if the runner is working with them, then he’s not working with anyone else.
At the end of the evening there’s no need to ask the waiters for the three euros. They all give more. It’s like protection money.
I’ve noticed a change in the others, too: they see me as an equal, as one of them — no longer a plaything. That’s what they were waiting for, perhaps, to see if I had enough grit to stick it out.”
— A Waiter in Paris (2021: pp.132–133)
Another encounter involves the procuring, preparing and delivery of olives for a special group of diners — only Chisholm, his fellow waiter, and the reader know the journey those olives took. We also mused on ‘live where the tomatoes are good’, a piece of layered life advice fellow waiter Salvatore gives Chisholm. Sidenote, we did end up discussing where the tomatoes are actually good — Croatia and Italy were two suggestions.
As we carried and referenced our copies of the book during the walk, we also interrogated the title itself. A Waiter in Paris activates a social role coupled with one’s urban imaginations of a city such as Paris; it makes you want to fill in the story. Other book titles and song names that made us feel the same came to mind, especially those from the perspective of the outsider. Sting’s single Englishman in New York. Mark Vanhoenacker’s Imagine a City: A Pilot Sees the World (2022). We were even reminded of a past Q&A we had with Geographer and Author Giada Peterle who described ‘urban spaces as narrative archives’. A Waiter in Paris is one such archive of life in Paris activated by Chisholm’s writing:
“It’s not really my story; I was merely an observer passing through. ‘A camera with its shutter open’, as Christopher Isherwood wrote of his time in Berlin.”
— A Waiter in Paris (2021: p.3)
As we follow Edward’s journey from runner to waiter, we find ourselves rooting for him as he navigates the complexities of the restaurant world. To read a book titled A Waiter in Paris is to also gain an insight into how waitering is an art form, requiring a delicate balance of humanity, decency, and sometimes manipulation.
We talked about how the scene of the Parisian restaurant became the author’s tiny window to observe urban life. As a “third place” in the city, as described by author Ray Oldenburg in The Great Good Place (1999), the restaurant is not merely a place to eat in. It works as an everyday melting pot of different cultures generating interpersonal and communal interaction of people from all walks of life. We commented on the ‘place ballet’ of La Bistrot de La Seine, it was an intersection of different groups of people’s spatial and temporal routines. For the workers, the restaurant was a daily grind and seasonal challenge; for tourists and diners, a one-off adventure immersed in the performance of the front stage of the restaurant. They are all experiencing a different Paris.
We reflected on the ballet of behaviours we saw in the lower and upper kitchens of La Bistrot de La Seine, scenes that are usually invisible to diners and revealed to the reader. As readers we feasted on the time pressures and anxieties that came with waiters fighting it out to get their orders completed, putting food that had fallen on the floor back on the plate, or cleaning a spill with anything that came to hand be it a sleeve, napkin or something out of the bin. As we walked and talked, we were reminded of The Bear TV series which also depicts the intensity and chaos of a Chicago restaurant kitchen with the constant shouting of “BEHIND”, anxieties of completing orders on time, and colourful characters.
Along with facing the restaurant and the city, we thought about how Chisholm faces himself with the city and Philosopher Georg Simmel’s Metropolis and Mental Life (1903) on how one mentally navigates the city. We’re taken on twists and turns through Parisian restaurants, different accommodation, dark streets and hidden spaces as well as through the twists and turns of Chisholm’s own mentality in navigating being homeless, jobless and an outsider.
The metropolis, or the magnificent city, has a unique way of fragmenting our mentality, leaving us staring nakedly into the abyss. Yet, at the same time, it has the power to heal. This duality is beautifully captured in the book. One such expression of this is in a moment from the chapter ‘A Taste of Restaurant Life’ where Chisholm writes about his own gaze on Paris:
“Even when you’re exhausted, broke and hungry, there’s still an indefinable magic of the place. And no matter how much your feet hurt after a never-ending shift, how physically dead you feel as you walk up the Avenue de l’Opéra at night, or across the Seine under the shadow of Notre-Dame, inside, you can’t help but feel intensively alive. Because you’re in it, you’re in the film. You’re not watching, you’ve got a walk-on, speaking part. And everything feels possible. Besides, when you’re in Paris you couldn’t care less about anywhere else. Your world shrinks; it’s the centre of the universe. There is nowhere else.”
— A Waiter in Paris (2021: p.204)
Edward, thank you for answering our questions. We had a wonderful walk through Regent’s Park discussing A Waiter in Paris. As urbanists, we couldn’t help but dwell on the spatial imaginings and way in which the grit of urban life was portrayed in this account of your time in Paris. So that is the perspective from which we would like to ask our questions.
You wrote about how within Paris it may be possible to find all of France and that the scenes and stories you observed are indicative of urban life in other cities too. George Orwell’s Down and Out in Paris and London (1933) was also one of the books you mention travelling with you when you moved to Paris.
How would you compare the ‘dark heart of Paris’ to the ‘dark heart’ of London? Or equally, to anywhere else you have lived?
It’s hard to compare, in the sense that both cities are a reflection of their histories. For example, one thing you notice immediately is how former colonies play a huge part in the ethnic make-up of the city. In France, the majority of people working at the lower end of the social ladder are North African or from sub-Saharan French-speaking African countries. In London South Asia is much more represented.
That said, London also feels more international, more cosmopolitan, you find the whole world there; whereas Paris feels distinctly French, particularly intramuros, outside of the peripherique it is a different story, there’s a distinct division there. Whereas in London, which is more a collection of joined up villages, everybody is more spread out.
We mused on the title during our walk too and asked our attendees what it was about the book title that made them want to join us. The title contains a fusion of spatial and personal identity. In the book, you mention publishing ‘Notes from a Parisian kitchen’ in The New York Times.
When did ‘Notes from a Parisian Kitchen’ become A Waiter in Paris? And why this title?
Notes from a Parisian Kitchen was the title given to the article by the NY Times editor, probably inspired by Dostoyevsky’s Notes from Underground. My working title for the manuscript was always The Waiting Game, because the double sense of waiting intrigued me. However this was never particularly liked, and in the end the publisher wanted something that didn’t need to be deciphered, and that’s where A Waiter in Paris was born. There was some discussion whether it should be waiters, plural, but in the end it stayed singular.
Paris itself is a main character. And we say character because of the way in which your writing personifies Paris as human and as female. You describe Paris as ‘quiet’ with ‘her avenues empty’ in the opening. During the snow, Paris is ‘replaced by a soft memory’. Paris ‘cares little’ for the workers that keep the city running ‘for she has seen them all before and will see many more’.
Can you reflect on this personification? What image and experience of Paris does it help depict?
It’s almost a cliché to refer to Paris in the feminine, and initially I tried to avoid it, but coming from London, and essentially comparing it with London, the personification became more apt. London feels distinctly masculine in my mind’s eye. Whereas Paris more feminine. Maybe it’s the intimacy of central Paris, the presence of more organic forms on building façades or metro entrances. It’s also no doubt informed by other writers. But there’s something more austere and concrete based about London, which obviously suffered a lot more damage during the war.
You’ve shown us a really delicate description of the urban spaces of Paris at various scales, touching upon both the outdoor city and the interior world of the Parisian restaurant. As readers, we’ve encountered urban life in Paris’ alleys, courtyards, trains, parks, a car and so much more. We’ve been presented with the socio-spatial hierarchies of restaurant kitchens and cafes as well as the experience of being together yet feeling alone at the Bistrot de la Seine.
Can you share an insight into your writing process for distilling and capturing this array of spatial dimensions?
That’s very kind, thank you. I have to admit that this was a huge part of the writing process. So much ink has been spilled describing Paris that I was keen not to fall into the same trap and employ the usual tired tropes to describe the city. Giving a sense of the size of the city, the macro experience helps place the reader in the intoxicating experience of being somewhere new, and all of the 19th century changes to Paris (wide boulevards, square, and public spaces) for this upon you. But it is very superficial, in the sense that you quickly step from this ceremonial world to something much smaller, more intimate, and often forgotten to the mists of time. The interior spaces are, especially in the less glamorous areas, often dilapidated after years and years of neglect. So choosing the right details to express this hopefully gave the reader a rich idea of what these places were actually like.
We opened the book walk by asking everyone if there was a moment in the book that made them laugh. And we would love to ask you the same. Is there a memory from the book that still makes you laugh when you recall it?
There were many moments that made me laugh, in fact the whole experience was probably much more joyous than written. The writing process tended to bring out the feeling of injustice I felt about the experience and the people that are going through it. So in the second draft I was keen to rectify that by adding more of the humourous exchanges that were the day-to-day of life in a gang of waiters.
We are part of UCL Urban Lab and we wanted to use the term ‘urban lab’ to launch our last question. You are currently working on a second book project about Paris. Can you tell us a bit about your next book and why Paris is your ‘urban lab’ for writing stories?
I imagine it’s because I amassed such a wealth of experience from the seven years I lived there that I have a rich well from which to draw upon. I love the idea of being able to transport someone there through words.
As for the next book, it is slightly different in that I will be recounting the story of something that happened in the late 60s. So I will need to draw on my own experience but also plenty of primary sources. To be honest, I am still working through how I will do it, but I am hoping that the research will illuminate the way.
This piece was written by Sidra Ahmed (PhD, UCL Geography) and Yichang Sun (PhD, UCL The Bartlett School of Architecture) with thanks from UCL Urban Laboratory

Paris in the rain is glorious, especially if the rain isn’t hard and unrelenting. My wife Gaywynn and I were in Paris, staying in the 16th arrondissement at our friend Philippe’s grand apartment in May. Philippe’s place is on the rue Raynouard, not far from the Seine, within walking distance of Trocadéro. We stayed a week. We stayed long enough so that we fell into a kind of domestic routine. That included shopping for food. It’s a lovely way to experience Paris, and we were grateful.
Some days it rained. It never stopped us.
Philippe walked us around his neighborhood, showed us where he shopped for food, greeting all the shop owners who clearly knew him. Later, we followed in his footsteps. We cooked a few meals for Philippe, and so we needed to buy food.
We did our shopping mainly on the rue de l‘Annonciation, a narrow pedestrian street that flows into the broader, longer rue de Passy. We walked it many times, up and back, passing by all those shops and stores that truly sustain a neighborhood — butcher, produce, wine, bakery, seafood. Each is its own world, pulsing with tradition and high standards. Paris is a city of shops. (How many cities do you know still are?) They give you intimacy. They individualize you.
Sometimes, we would eat at Aéro, a brasserie at the end of rue de l‘Annonciation on the Place de Passy, where we could sit outside. We came to think of it as our brasserie. That’s what happens when you stay for a while in Paris. You find a place to call your own. You make an attachment to it. It belongs to you, and you belong to it.
After a week, we belonged to our neighborhood and to Paris.
We bought meat at Les Bouchers Doubles at 43 rue de l’Annonciation. We bought vegetables at Marché Couvert de Passy. We bought pastries at Aux Merveilleux de Fred — yes, I know, “Fred” doesn’t sound French — and bread at Aux Pains de Manon, both on rue de l’Annonciation. Did any of the people behind the counters recognize us by the end of the week? I’d like to think, or to pretend, they did. They always smiled, in any case.
Some days we went to Monoprix, a store I like very much. The name, Monoprox, is not very romantic. It’s a practical place, with a practical name, and I always feel practical shopping there. You don’t shop at Monoprix for souvenirs, but you do find things you need. For splendor, Gaywynn and I went to La Grande Épicerie de Paris on rue de Passy, where we found the best France has to offer. It was amazing to see what they considered exotic produce from America — they sold Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, for example.
It rained several days while we were there. I never minded. I think rain brings out a stunning aspect of Paris. It makes the city moody, and me as well. I feel I’m a poet when I walk rainy Paris. Rain is disparaged too much, more than it should be. People talk about rain as if it were some kind of setback. It’s rain. That’s all. You can get wet. It’s all worth it when the rain is falling in Paris, and the gray light makes everything the best black and white film you’ve ever seen, and you smell the damp air and hear car tires hissing on the wet streets.
I think you can be a citizen of Paris by right of passion.
When it rained, we might dart into the Librairie Fontaine, a sweet bookstore on rue de l‘Annonciation. We discovered one of the young employees, who spoke flawless French, was American. I’d never heard any American speak French as well as he did. What I wouldn’t give to be able to work in a French bookstore! Well, here’s to reincarnation.
I speak French passably. If a Parisian speaks, as they do sometimes, at the speed of light, then I’m lost. If the conversation is at a reasonable clip, though, and it’s just the two of us, I can manage. Speaking a language not your own and that you don’t speak fluently is a lesson in humility and error. But when you speak French in Paris and are understood, that’s a chest-rising feeling. So, I jump in. I never mind being clumsy. They’re not going to report me.
Returning after a long day on the Left Bank, we walked from our Métro station, Passy, up the long hill to rue de Passy. We didn’t have the climbing energy the students who disembarked with us had. Never mind. There was Desgranges bakery waiting at the top, on rue de Passy, with something weight-increasing, but God did it taste good. That gave us the motivation we needed.
Then home to rue Raynouard, into the small, slowly-rising elevator, off at our floor, inserting the key Philippe had given us, opening the door, throwing ourselves onto his couch, restoring ourselves, and then ready, in a while, to venture out again.
Our corner of Paris. It’s in our heart.

“Don’t come to Paris if you can’t speak French, they will ignore you right away”
“Don’t you ever speak English in Paris, they’ll be mad, trust me”
As an English Education student, those sayings always overwhelmed me whenever I wanted to go to Paris. Well, as an English Education Student, it is my basic talent to at least speak and communicate with people using the English Language. However, I am always curious about those sayings. Is it actually true? That Parisians hate people who speak English? Will they get mad at you? or will they be harsh on you?
Here are some facts that you need to know about English in Paris based on my experience as a Student Exchange of a short course program at SciencesPo, Paris, France.
Parisians have high nationalism about their country
When I arrived in Paris for the first time, there was a man who communicated with me and talked about politics after a piece of news came from a television in a lobby hotel. He talked about how he disagreed with the new American president. He said that it is such a shame that people don’t actually use their rights to vote for the right president.
At first, I was shocked when I heard his story about politics all of sudden as soon as I arrived at my hotel. Second, I was shocked because he literally used English directly to talk with me. Third, it turns out he didn’t even care to talk about such things even though I am a hijabi, since I heard that some Parisians are Islamophobic.
Lots of questions in my head right after 5 minutes I arrived. Yet, as a Gen Z, me and my curiosity couldn’t even stand to ask those questions to the man.
So I asked him,
“Wait sir, before we continue, I am actually amazed, because however, you are French, and you are talking to me in English, it’s just…you know...I often heard Parisians hate tourists, especially people who speak English. Then how do you just naturally speak English right away?”
Then, he answered
Haha, it’s funny because however, it’s not actually 100% correct. Do some French speak English? yes. But do they hate it? well not all of them. You know what, we actually not that bad.
Since it’s not answering all of my questions, I asked him once again.
Okay, got it, so it’s only a stereotype right? but why do “some” of them hate it? I mean what is wrong with using English in Paris? and one more question, Do Parisian hate Muslims? Because i am a hijabi and to be honest i am afraid that people will don’t like my hijab sir.
He smiled and said,
You know what young lady, we are not that bad once again. I mean, yea some of us still hate people who don’t “act” like us. Why? it’s because we do realize how hard we achieve our condition to be independent and win the war. We’ve come this far, then,
“how come people use another language in our country?”
“don’t they be proud of our language? why they use another language if they came here?”
Back then, let me tell you that we are so open to people. For example, Chinese. We always welcome tourist whocame. But day by day it seems that they “try” to domain the land. They start to sell their products, feels like they want to conquer our land. That’s why, perhaps, not all French are friendly when they saw another people. Especially if it seems that they try to domain the land.
I was amazed, mesmerized by his answer, and nod right away.
French people have high nationalism towards their country. I did realize it after I came to Arc de Triomphe on November, 11th 2024. When it’s a day of remembrance. This day commemorates the armistice that ended World War I, signed between the Allies and Germany in Compiègne, France on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. Since 2012, the day has also served as a remembrance for all of France’s war dead.
Under the Arc de Triomphe, there is a Rekindling of the Flame. This ceremony takes place every evening at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The Flame Committee rekindles the Flame of Remembrance to honor the soldiers who died in World War I and other conflicts. The remains of an unknown soldier are buried beneath the Arc de Triomphe. The tomb features an eternal flame that burns in memory of the soldiers who died in both world wars.
On that day, they also raise a giant flag in the middle of the Arc de Triomphe
When I went there, I was amazed by how people mourn and truly remember the history behind it. All of them gather and give some flowers and respect those who died in honor back then. Then I realized that Paris, indeed, is a city full of history.
In a nutshell? English in Paris, is it a friend or foe? I can loudly say that it is actually a friend. When I was there I literally used 90% English and 10% messy French. Yet, most of them still smiling and answering my questions.
However, here are some tips and tricks if you want to speak English safely in Paris.
Most Parisians will appreciate how you say something if you add some French to it! Even though it is as simple as “merci”. I usually use “excusez-moi” and “je ne parle français, je parle anglais” which means “Excuse me, I can’t speak french, I can speak English”. After that, they will usually say that my French accent is good even though I said that I can’t speak French. Then they will also try to answer my questions in English since it seems like I have the intention to ask my questions in their language even though I can’t.
2. Keep smiling no matter what
As what “the man” said in my previous story, it is obvious that all people will welcome your English. So, keep smiling no matter what, so that they realize you already tried your best to ask something in French.
3. “Bonjour” and “Merci” is the key
Every time you want to ask something to someone in English. Always remember to say at least Bonjour and Merci. Especially in the Supermarket. I realize that people in supermarkets like Carrefour mostly are not welcome whenever we use English to communicate with them. Especially in those hectic moments at the cashier. I think they are just too tired to talk more in English. That’s why, you could encourage them to talk with you by at least, saying “bonjour” and “merci”.
And those are some tips and tricks to survive with your English in Paris! Trust me, Paris is not that bad for tourists. I mean, France has the highest number of tourists from all over the world. If I can describe it in a sentence, I would say that Paris is such a beautiful, magical, and endearing city. So, come to Paris and feel the atmosphere of love and historical value from the architecture. Trust me, you won’t regret it.
enchanté Paris! Merci!

Ah, le dixième. One of my favorite Parisian neighborhoods (after my beloved Montmartre, of course), you’ll often find me there on a given weekend. It’s one of the least “touristy” areas in the city — I lived in Paris for a full six months as a student back in 2012 and never even knew it existed — and I love spending time in these small pockets of unspoiled places in Paris. Well, maybe not completely unspoiled but you get the idea.
And while I’d love to keep the 10th arrondissement all to myself, I’m no gatekeeper. For those of you coming to Paris to visit, or maybe Paris residents who, like me in 2012, never ventured up to the tenth, here are some spots to add to your to-see lists.
The Gare du Nord and Gare de l’Est aren’t necessarily “sights to see,” but they are in the 10th arrondissement and you’ll likely need to access them at some point if you plan on doing some traveling.
Both are known as being on the “sketchy” side but I have never personally had any issues there. Pay attention and keep your belongings close and you shouldn’t have a problem. Gare du Nord will get you to places in northern Europe (as well as merry old England) and Gare de L’Est will get you to places in eastern Europe (and beyond), respectfully.
If you have spent time in the 10th arrondissement, I’m willing to bet it was along the Canal Saint Martin. This little waterway that flows from Bastille all the way up to La Villette in the 19th arrondissement has often been a sanctuary for me, particularly on those sweltering August nights, as the leaves begin to fall in autumn, and even during a drizzle in the colder months.
When the weather cooperates, there are plenty of places to sit down next to the canal with a good book. If you don’t feel the need to be directly on the canal, there’s a lovely park called the Jardin Villemin with lots of grass to sit on.
My yoga studio is along the canal (Jivamukti Yoga Paris if you’re interested), and I will often make the 40-minute walk from my place in the 18th arrondissement to get there.
The bar Le Comptoir Général is a vibe and is my go-to when I want to impress friends in town visiting. Chez Prune is a bit more on the casual side (and more authentically French, in my opinion), and I’ve shared many a glass of wine/charcuterie board there over the years. Ten Belles for coffee, always, and Maria Belza for tapas. Trust me.
For those who love a good story, the Canal was also where Earful Tower host Oliver Gee heard the story that led to his first children’s book, Kylie the Crocodile in Paris. It makes a fun gift for kids who might be interested in the City of Light.
There are a myriad of marchés (markets) to be found in Paris — some are static, like the rue Mouffetard or le marché des Enfants-Rouges, while others set up shop just a few times a week.
Like le marché des Enfants-Rouges, le marché Saint-Quentin is a covered market. It’s one of the largest and oldest markets of its kind in the city (first built in 1835, destroyed in 1852, and rebuilt in 1866), and is home to produce sellers, butchers, florists, fishmongers, cheesemongers…there are even places to buy beer and wine.
While this isn’t my favorite marché in the city (I have a penchant for rue Mouffetard myself), it’s worth a visit if you get there early enough to beat the crowds. Doors open at 8am every day.
The 10th arrondissement is not short on nightlife. I like places that are cool and cozy with a big enough terrasse to fit me and all of my friends. I first started hanging out on the cour des Petites Écuries because a friend of mine worked at a small bar there. That was about five years ago and I often find myself returning on a Thursday or Friday evening.
The street is tiny, only about 850 feet long. Nestled along the cobblestones are about a dozen cafés, bars, and restaurants to discover. And, if you venture off the street you’ll find dozens more. It’s a good option if you like to bar-hop and wander. Most places are very affordable if you’re on a budget.
Like most Parisian neighborhoods, the 10th arrondissement is also a wonderful place for a stroll. Use the places I mentioned above as a jumping-off point and then explore on your own. You just may get lost for a few hours, but that’s never a bad thing in Paris.

Last Thursday, April 3, my family and I got dressed in historically-inspired formal wear and headed off to The Buckland Club’s Siege of Paris dinner.
The dinner was over a year in the making, and I’m still so proud, honored, and amazed to say that I’ve been involved from nearly the start of it.
In March 2024, I was contacted by Andrew Morris, Chairman of The Buckland Club, a club that meets twice every year in Birmingham, England, for unusual themed dinners. Named for Frank Buckland, a 19th century British naturalist who famously ate countless different kinds of animals, their motto is Semper in ventrem aliquid novi. (Always something new in the stomach.).
Andrew explained that the theme of the Club’s spring 2025 dinner would be the Siege of Paris, and he wanted to know if I’d like to be its sponsor.
The role wasn’t a financial one (much to my relief — my love of the Siege of Paris is boundless, but alas, my budget is not), but rather more like an organizer and lecturer. I would help plan the menu (including, I’d find out, the images on the actual paper menus and place mats), and then, on the night of the dinner, I’d discuss each course and the history behind it in 5–7 minutes in front of a hungry and curious crowd.
I was very honored — and all in. I loved the idea of bringing food from the Siege to life…even though it was notoriously terrible.
That, though, Andrew explained to me, was exactly why The Buckland Club’s members wanted to try it out.
Over the past year, Andrew, as well as Club president Roger Hale and deputy chair Hazel Riggall, have been frequent online companions. We’ve spent hours discussing things like how to acquire edible and ethically sourced zoo animals to eat, the history of Parisian bread, and the availability of potatoes and cheese during the Siege.
As you might imagine, I was thrilled to be able to talk about and dissect (no pun intended) these topics. And it was always such a pleasure to receive their friendly and curious messages, and to see them “live” on Zoom calls.
We had some challenges along the way, just as you would with any major undertaking. For instance, Roger, who does the page layout for the Club’s menus, needed a more high-definition copy of the Café Voisin menu from the Siege. Luckily, we were able to reach out to the Musée Escoffier, who has an original copy and very kindly sent us an actual photo of it.
There were also long email exchanges about the bread. If you read this blog, you probably know I’m a tiny bit obsessed with Siege bread, to say the least. When white flour ran out during the Siege, bread was made with ingredients like potato flakes, crushed peas, and even straw. Intrepid bread makers Roger and Hazel were able to come up with several variations of Siege bread, based on contemporary accounts we have of it. But most of it had to be edible…more edible, that is, than actual Siege bread, which notoriously caused indigestion and was so horrible that pieces of it were saved as souvenirs of the hardship Parisians endured during the Siege.
That kind of adaptation sums up what the dinner became. On the one hand, the members of The Buckland Club are boundlessly curious and open-minded when it comes to food. But on the other hand, we didn’t want anyone to leave the dinner hungry or sick. So, some compromises were made.
In the end, the dinner ended up being a wonderful, Siege-inspired affair. And while each course may not have been an exact replica of what someone would have eaten during this time, it was an intriguing jumping-off point for me to discuss during my speeches and a very cool homage to that era.
The Buckland Club members were attentive and enthusiastic listeners, which truly warmed my heart and made the evening even more fun. And they’re just great people in general. It was an unforgettable experience.
If you’re curious about what exactly we ate, here’s a breakdown of the menu (with photos of each course).
The paper menus and place mats
Okay, these weren’t edible parts of the Siege of Paris dinner, but they were definitely important. Roger Hale had asked me to send him images I thought would illustrate the Siege and our particular dinner. We had limited space, so it was a challenge, but in the end, I sent him:
~ one of my favorite cartoons from that time, an illustration by Cham of a man at a dinner table who’s just had a cat jump down his throat. The French caption translates to: “The risk of eating mice is that your cat might chase after them.”
~ a drawing of a line in front of a Municipal Butcher’s. Parisians would redeem their increasingly meager meat (or, as the Siege continued, dried fish) rations here. Sometimes, supplies would run out and the people would complain and even try to storm the butcher’s, hence the presence of members of the National Guard. Getting your ration often meant queuing for hours during a winter with record-breaking cold temperatures.
~ a drawing of one of the city’s infamous cat, dog, and rat butcher stands. These animals, along with horses, were the main sources of meat for Parisians, outside their small ration from the municipal butchers (if the ration was still available and they were able to brave hours-long lines and freezing temperatures).
~ another cartoon by Cham, of a well-dressed man holding a loaf of bread beneath his arm as he walks along the street. This was from a moment fairly early in the Siege where non-government bakeries or possibly one’s own kitchen could still provide white-flour loaves. People were being asked to bring their own bread to restaurants, and having your fine white flour bread was a status symbol.
~ a photo of one of my Siege of Paris bread souvenirs.
~ a famous image and relic from the Siege: The December 25, 1870 menu from the Café Voisin, which, like many Parisian restaurants, still operated during the Siege, though their offerings had to be adapted based on what food was available. Sometimes, restaurants showed a sense of honesty and humor, as in this case. Among other Siege-era offerings, you’ll find “Le Chat flanqué de rats” (cat flanked by rats), as well as meat from zoo animals. This menu was also one of the main sources of inspiration for our Siege of Paris dinner.
~ one of the cover images from Album du siège par Cham et Daumier, a collection of cartoons by Cham and Daumier that cover the experience of the Siege. This particular image shows an allegorical representation of Paris (recognizeable by both her tower crown and the convenient word “Paris” written on it) eagerly gathering rats into her mouth while surrounded by a pot with a dog and a cat in it.
Roger also added photos of the Siege bread-inspired loaves he and Hazel had made for the dinner, on a special insert page that featured my translations of some of the contemporary accounts and recipes we have for Siege bread.
I can’t tell you how moved I was when I came into the dining room at the Edgbaston Golf Club and saw those place settings with these familiar and beloved illustrations. It felt like a real way to honor the people who experienced the Siege of Paris, and to celebrate their humor and resilience. Everything also just looked really great.
I felt blown away, as you can see from the expression on my face in this photo, which my son snapped just as we sat down.
Canapés
But I’m getting a bit ahead of myself, because we didn’t enter the dining room right away. First, there were drinks and canapés.
The drinks ranged from water to alcohol, which were all available during the Siege. There wasn’t Coke at the time, but my son was still happy to be offered a glass, and hey, other kinds of sugary treats were also usually easily obtainable during the Siege, including chocolate and jam.
The canapés themselves consisted of scoops of sardine pâté with a slice of radish on top. Sardines are included in the Café Voisin’s menu, but were likely canned or dried. We had discussed using some kind of dried fish, which was what was mostly available during the Siege. In fact, towards the end of it, many municipal butcher’s had run out of meat and were giving out dried cod instead. But that would have been a bit tricky to eat.
The radish slice was inspired by the Café Voisin menu, where radishes are listed among the hors d’oeuvres. Vegetables were hard to come by during the Siege, since no one had been prepared to stockpile those that might last, and since the bitterly cold autumn and winter wasn’t the best time to grow anything. And yet, some Parisians or refugees from nearby suburbs did have small gardens or small stockpiles of vegetables from before the Siege. Some of them cultivated gardens just outside the city wall, or might even have ventured back to their evacuated suburban homes to see what they could gather (if the place hadn’t been looted already). Others, including restaurant owners, may have procured vegetables from the black market.
So, while not every Parisian was regularly enjoying vegetables, it was possible, especially for the clientele of an upscale restaurant like the Café Voisin, who had different ways of obtaining them, from possibly growing them or relying on their own stock, to paying exorbitant prices for them legally or through black market sellers.
The canapés were served on modern-day Siege bread. This was made by Roger and Hazel, based on recipes and accounts from the Siege, including:
“One pound of this bread contains: An eighth of common wheat flour, 4/8 of a mixture of potato flakes, rice, lentils, split peas, vetches, oats, and rye ground up in abnormal portions, 2/8 of water, 1/8 of straw and vegetable shell remains.” — Jacques-Henri Paradis, in his memoir Journal du siège, par un bourgeois de Paris (my translation)
and
“It seems to have been made with old panama hats picked up out of the gutters.” — courtesy of the often sassy chronicler Henri d’Alméras (my translation)
Hazel’s bread contained Siege-inspired ingredients including rye flour, chickpea flour, and pea flour. Roger created two versions of Siege bread. The first contains ingredients like dried and pounded potato peelings, green and red lentils, buckwheat flour, and rice flour.
The second version of Roger’s bread contained actual straw.
As you can imagine, as someone sort of obsessed with Siege bread, I couldn’t wait to try these. While the sardine pâté stole the show in terms of flavor, I was thrilled to detect little rough, grainy bits in the bread.
Unfortunately, none of these bits were straw. The Club had decided not to serve Roger’s Siege bread batch that contained straw, although some members had tried it during a tasting a few weeks prior. The general consensus of those I talked to was that it lived up to its reputation and was hard to eat. One Club member told me she was still picking bits of straw out of her teeth!
That said, another member pulled me aside towards the end of the evening and confessed that he didn’t think the straw bread was that bad and that if he were ever in a Siege of Paris situation, he’d be fine with the bread.
While I was glad Roger had made it and that some people had actually tasted it and could tell me about it, I have to admit, I was disappointed that I wouldn’t get to experience the straw Siege bread myself. Not even to taste, per se — one of the things we’d all discussed was possibly leaving a small slice of it by each place setting with the option of either tasting it or saving it as a souvenir. But it turns out there wasn’t enough of the straw bread for all 60+ attendees.
Luckily, there would be a surprise for me a little later…..
First Course: Onion Soup without the Onion, and another version of Siege bread
A basket of bread inspired by Siege recipes was on every table for the first course. This bread had been baked by the kitchen staff of the Edgbaston Golf Club, led by Head Chef Chris Haynes. Everyone I met who worked at the Edgbaston Golf Club was kind and amazing. I’m so grateful for their help and to Chris and his team for being so open to making all of these unusual dishes. I can’t thank them enough.
Their version of the bread was more edible and went down smoothly. I think it could have absolutely been served at a regular dinner without raising an eyebrow, and for that, I’m sure our guests were grateful.
As for the soup, the name was inspired by an actual recipe in La Cuisinière assiégée, ou L’art de vivre en temps de siége (The Besieged Cook, or art de vivre in times of siege), a cookbook anonymously published near the end of the Siege or shortly after. The book contains recipes for homemakers and, understandably, focuses a lot on replacing or simply doing without certain ingredients.
Onion soup without the onion has always made me smile a bit. The description is at once practical and honest, and a bit funny — very much in keeping with the sense of grim humor we see in things like the cartoons published during the Siege or on restaurant menus that openly describe the unusual animals they’re serving, rather than being discreet about it (say, by calling cat “rabbit” or simply listing stew, not its ingredients).
The recipe itself, though, isn’t just a joke. It’s an actual option for someone with few ingredients available to them (the book also contains an actual onion soup recipe, if the cook was able to get their hands on an onion or two).
Here’s the recipe for Onion Soup without the Onion, from La Cuisinière assiégée (my translation):
“Melt fat into a frying pain; take slices of bread, that you will toast for a long time; add the necessary amount of water, salt, and pour it over your slices of bread.”
Andrew and I toyed with the idea of actually serving this soup. But seeing that it was a paid dinner and that we didn’t want Club members to actually starve, Andrew came up with a different solution: Why not make a traditional French onion soup and then explain all of the ingredients, including cheese, normal bread, and actual onions, that would not have been in this recipe or have been easily available to most Parisians?
So, that’s what we did.
Although the part of me that longs for authenticity was a bit disappointed, the soup lifted my spirits. I’m actually not a big fan of French onion soup, but this one was seasoned in a way that just really clicked with me. I thoroughly enjoyed it and am glad to have tasted it, regardless of the context.
It was also a fun and unique approach to give my speech about this course and have everyone imagine each of its crucial ingredients missing. I think everyone felt grateful to not be eating onion soup during the Siege.
Main Course: Civet de Kangourou (Kangaroo Stew), Petits-Pois au Beurre (peas in butter), Boiled Potatoes
Our main course was one of the biggest decisions we had to make. Namely, what meat should we choose? Naturally, when you think of the Siege of Paris, meat sources like cat, dog, and, especially, rat, come to mind. But none of us wanted to eat cat or dog (or legally could have in the UK, for that matter).
It turns out that Andrew has tried dog before, during a trip to North Korea, and he could confirm that, as many Siege -era accounts claim, it tastes a bit like mutton. I’ve also heard testimonials by an Italian man who, during World War II, ate cat and said that, as Siege-era Parisians often claimed, it tastes like rabbit.
I haven’t heard much about what rat tasted like, but when you think about it, some cultures do eat other kinds of rodents — for instance, guinea pig in several South American countries, so it must be pretty tasty.
There was some discussion among club members about possibly procuring rat in some way, or replacing it with a similar rodent. But to be honest, that sort of sat heavily with me. I genuinely like rats, as you may know, and felt a bit sad about the prospect of eating one. Luckily, the idea was quickly shot down, since the Club had recently had a dinner where rodents were served and didn’t want to repeat themselves. The same went for horses, another fairly common meat source during the Siege.
When Andrew then suggested pigeon, which people do indeed eat today and would probably be fairly easy to get our hands on, I realized I had truly become immersed in the Siege of Paris, because I felt horrified.
Not just because I also really love pigeons and believe that if I were reincarnated as a bird, that’s what I would be, but because pigeons were considered heroes during the Siege of Paris.
In a city cut off from the world, they were the only way for people to get messages from outside the city walls, through a roll of microfilm inserted into a metal tube attached to a pigeon’s feathers. Although not every homing pigeon made it back to Paris safely, those who did were able to get more than 100, 000 messages to isolated, worried Parisians. That’s why when you look at many images commemorating the Siege, you’ll often see drawings of pigeons included. They were even included on Bartholdi’s monument to the Siege’s balloonists that stood at Porte des Ternes, before it was melted down in World War II.
Not every pigeon in Paris in 1870 and 1871 was a homing pigeon, of course, but they were all respected, because you never knew.
I’m sure some people still ate pigeons — in fact, a Siege memoir by Charles Laurent claims that some people counted their tail feathers to determine whether or not they were homing pigeons in order to try to catch and eat those who weren’t. But even so, this wasn’t something that was accepted or proclaimed or joked about the same way eating just about any other animal was at the time.
So, pigeon was also ruled out for our menu (much to my secret relief).
In the end, we opted to go upscale and choose kangaroo, an animal that is still eaten today and is available in the UK. This wasn’t much of a compromise, though, since civet de kangourou (kangaroo stew) is an actual item on the Café Voisin menu.
Zoo animals from the Jardin des Plantes and the Jardin d’Acclimation, which was located just outside the city and whose animal population had to be relocated to the Jardin des Plantes, unfortunately weren’t able to be fed for very long after the Siege started. In order to keep them from suffering and dying a slow death from starvation, the zookeepers made an arrangement to sell most of the animals, either exclusively or primarily to the upscale Boucherie Anglaise (English Butcher’s, appropriately enough for the location of our dinner).
These animals could be sold freshly butchered or canned, and they came at a high price, which means most Parisians never got to taste them. But some more privileged ones did, including Victor Hugo, who wrote about eating elephant in his memoirs of the Siege.
Although the menus that offered zoo animals were often honest or humorous about it, many Parisians had a bit of melancholy, especially about eating elephant, since two of those elephants were Castor and Pollux, beloved animals who children used to ride at the zoo. The accounts of their deaths are among the most heartbreaking things I’ve ever read about the Siege.
In addition to elephant consommé and kangaroo stew, you’ll find other zoo animal offerings on the Café Voisin menu, including wolf, which Andrew very cleverly also “included” in our Siege of Paris dinner menu by serving his favorite wines, fittingly called Le Loup Blanc (The White Wolf) and L’Espirt du Loup (The Spirit of the Wolf).
As for our kangaroo stew, I was intrigued to try it (and trying hard not to think about how cool kangaroos are — after all, I eat pigs and cows all the time, and those animals are pretty cool in their own right, too). So was my son. One thing I admire about him is that while he can be a picky eater (for instance, despite being half-French, he did not want the melted Gruyere cheese in his French onion soup), he’s also an intrepid one. He’ll try almost anything, even if he’s not guaranteed to like it.
He had been talking about tasting kangaroo for weeks (maybe it’s a good thing that, unlike me when I was a kid, he’s not too into nature documentaries that feature them), and when the time came, he wasn’t disappointed. He described it as tasting like duck, and said “Mom, you’re going to love this!” as he enthusiastically took another bite.
Andrew was impressed by his comparison, which made me feel better about my son being there. There had been some debate about Edgbaston Golf Club’s policy, since they don’t usually allow children. But since the dinner was a private event, the Buckland Club advocated for us and my son was able to come and taste kangaroo and take lots of pictures of me and wear a suit and thin bowtie inspired by Napoleon III’s son Louis-Napoleon, who my son kind of looks like in one particular photo.
And so, Andrew announced at the dinner, my son is as of now the youngest person to attend a Buckland Club dinner, in all the Club’s 73-year history! I’m so grateful to Andrew for advocating for him, and to my son for behaving as well as I knew he would, and I’m glad he liked the food, too.
(My husband was also there, thrilled to wear a replica Civil War Union military jacket he’d gotten years ago as a gift from his American in-laws. I said if anyone asked him, he should tell them it was in homage to Wickham Hoffman, a former Civil War colonel who came to Paris and was American Ambassador Elihu Washburn’s secretary during the Siege. Both men’s diaries and/or memoirs happen to have been valuable sources to me when I was writing Hearts at Dawn, so everything tied nicely together.)
Sorry for hopping to another topic — back to the kangaroo. Although my son said it tasted like duck, we realized that was because he’s never tasted venison. But those of us who had, thought that it was a bit closer to that. It had a soft, pleasant, but slightly stringy texture that reminded me of brisket. Overall, a very good meal and one of the highlights.
The kangaroo stew served at the dinner was a sort of deconstructed version of the dish, which had probably been cooked along with the vegetables in the original version, both due to French tradition and probably the fact that this would have hidden the condition of some of the vegetables, which might not have been great-looking or could have been a bit wilted (for any leafy veggies or herbs that might have been included) at this point in the Siege.
Both peas and potatoes were somewhat available during the Siege. Petits pois au beurre — peas in butter — is even on the Café Voisin menu, although I’ve always been curious about the butter. From Berte Ainé , chef at another upscale restaurant, Peter’s, book Les menus d’un restaurant de Paris durant le siège, I know that dairy products could sometimes be procured via the black market (Ainé writes about a man who keeps milk-producing goats hidden in a barn or warehouse, for instance), but I do wonder if there were other places it was produced and sold, maybe legally? I want to do more research into this.
As for potatoes, you’ll sometimes come across them in menus or recipes from the time, but they were also fairly rare, at least rare enough for a sack of them to have been one of the items auctioned off at the Fête de la Charité, a charity event held in late December, around the time the Café Voisin menu was being served.
I haven’t come across many accounts about carrots in particular during the Siege, but they are listed, for instance, in the items and prices section of La Cuisinière assiégée. And they did taste really nice with the kangaroo….
Dessert: Cream of Rice, Coffee Served With Oat Milk
Although I don’t tend to like things like cream of rice, I was very excited to try this version, since it came from a Siege recipe I’d actually tried to make — and very, very badly failed at.
In December 2022, I tried my hand and making the cream of rice recipe included in La Cuisinière Assiégée. The recipe was challenging because there are no exact measurements or amounts of ingredients given, and instructions are cursory. My rice pudding ended up looking (and tasting) like just a pile of white rice with chocolate powder over it.
My blog post about my failed attempt at making crème de riz (cream of rice) was actually how Andrew found me in the first place, so while I didn’t get an edible dessert out of it, I got something so much better.
As I blogged at the time, I have no idea what the actual result of the recipe would have looked like at the time. Maybe this would have been close? Probably not, though, especially according to my French husband, who’s since re-read my blog post and the recipe and thinks there are a few things I should have done differently. We’re actually planning to try the recipe his way soon. I’ll report back on that when it happens.
As for the cream of rice served at the Siege of Paris dinner, it looked worlds away from what I’d made (which is a good thing). It was rich and creamy and comforting, which I’m not sure the original was — but again, I have no way of knowing for sure.
The one thing everyone noted about this one, though, was that you could still feel the rice grains. I don’t know if that has to do with the swap of oat milk (dairy milk was almost non-existent during the Siege, and the recipe calls for essentially making your own oat milk) or some other issue. Whatever the case, most Club members emptied their bowls. My son, who’s usually picky about texture, also really enjoyed it. So at the very least, at least dessert was good.
There was also coffee, which was available during the Siege, but in keeping with the Siege’s hardships, it was served with oat milk. (Sugar was also available for those who wanted it, since it wasn’t scarce during the Siege.)
The evening finished off with my final speech, as well as closing statements from Andrew, and absinthe for those who wanted it. Although absinthe is more associated with the Belle Epoque, it’s been around since at least the early 1800’s and was available during the Siege. My husband and I didn’t partake (nor did my son, I promise), but it was an interesting way to end the evening’s menu.
One of the best gifts ever
But the most amazing food-related conclusion of the evening came to me in the form of a gift. Towards the end of the meal, Andrew handed me a gift from him, Hazel, and Roger (in addition to a gift from the latter two, who had also incredibly kindly surprised me with a letter from January 1870), as well as the rest of the Club.
I opened it to find what is honestly one of the most thoughtful presents I’ve ever received, from anyone.
They had taken a small slice of Roger’s bread that had been made with the straw and mounted it onto a typed card — essentially making a modern-day Siege Bread souvenir.
Like most Siege bread souvenirs, the mounted card reads “Souvenir Historique”, but below the piece of bread, the text becomes wonderfully personal, reading:
THE BUCKLAND CLUB
SIEGE OF PARIS DINNER 1870–1871
SPONSOR: ALYSA SALZBERG
On the lower right-hand side is a picture of Frank Buckland. On the right is the Club’s seal and motto, Semper in ventrem aliquid novi. Between both is written:

Thursday 3rd April 2025
Examples of Siege Bread by Roger Hale
Here’s a comparison of a typical 1871 Siege of Paris souvenir shadow box and The Buckland Club’s modern-day Siege bread souvenir:
This gesture absolutely blew me away, and always will. I truly can’t express how moved I am by the thoughtfulness behind it.
My husband, son, and I are recovering from the amazing dinner and also a whirlwind 2-day stay in Birmingham where we used just about every free moment to visit and explore the city (huge shout-out to the surprisingly cool, fun, and fascinating Pen Museum, probably our favorite destination), try its famous Indian food, and take advantage of our sort-of guilty pleasure treat whenever we go to the UK, the Tesco meal deal. But as soon as we’re up and running again, my modern-day bread souvenir will join the 1871 souvenir shadow box on my wall.
I know that every time I look at it, I’ll feel a massive sense of joy, gratitude, and appreciation for everyone involved in this Siege of Paris dinner.
It was an amazing, once-in-lifetime experience to have collaborated on this dinner and have had the opportunity to try these Siege-inspired recipes. But best of all was being in the company of such interesting and truly kind people. I’m relieved that the Siege of Paris dinner went so well, but sad that it’s over. Still, I’ve made some memories — and friends — I’ll never forget.
A HUGE thank you again to Andrew, Hazel, and Roger, and to everyone at the Edgbaston Golf Club and The Buckland Club for this experience. And also for putting up with my Siege bread obsession.

Helping You Adapt to Life in France

“So anyway, that’s part of why I think France has more of a cafe culture than a coffee culture,” I concluded, having just explained how much I appreciated the growth of specialty coffee in Paris.
We were dining outside of the cathedral at Chartres and I was enduring the prison coffee so often served in many otherwise lovely restaurants in France. One of the Baby Boomers in the party heartily disagreed with my sentiment. “I think this is very good coffee,” he sniffed. I wasn’t sure why he felt the need to defend the general state of coffee in France, but I certainly feel no such need, despite loving life here.
The coffee in France in general and in Paris in particular is, at best, average. At worst, it’s dire, reminiscent of the strange brew you would find inside a Shell gas station in America in the late 1980s. No love, no care, just some grounds and hot water. And why have the French been okay with this? Because, as I contend, coffee in this country is, like a cigarette, more of a ritual. It’s about what is going on when you have a coffee, not the quality of the coffee itself. This isn’t to say that the French don’t know good coffee when they taste it. They just aren’t going to go out of their way to find it.

It’s been more than a year since I landed at Charles de Gaulle airport, a huge brutalist concrete jungle that hardly brings you an idea you’re in the city called “the city of love”.
Paris’ reputation is an absolutely extraordinary case — is there any other city in the world that has such a well-known symbol as the Eiffel Tower or such a strong myth around it filled with croissants, love, and romance? You may name New York or London but to me, Paris is what everyone has heard of first. Still, thousands of people are trying to copy the mythical Parisian fashion style and oh là là, la vie est belle spirit.
Having a degree in architecture and a strong visual perception I decided to share my vision on what are the key elements of this iconic city, the one I’ve been having a chance to learn all this time being already-not-a-tourist, not a longtime local either which means I might still have a rather fresh perception.
A significant part of Parisian architecture was created by Haussmann’s renovation program back in the second half of the 19th century. The old medieval neighborhoods were mostly demolished and instead of them, Paris got some wide boulevards and avenues, parks, and squares with larger buildings.
Walking the streets of the city once you stop paying attention to shop signs, ads, and posters you notice that the color which covers the largest area is beige. It’s the most common color on the walls, especially when these buildings were built during the Haussmann renovation.
As someone who used to travel a lot, I can’t mention that this typical Parisian style of architecture played a crucial role in other geographical areas as well. The streets of Casablanca were renovated surely because of the colonial past back in time and as the result, they look really similar to Paris with the only difference — blanca, “white” — colored in white mainly. Or the notable buildings in Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, and Mexico City — everywhere I noticed similarities with Paris at some point.
Next comes the accent color and the first one I’d name is an emerald green. It’s the color you see on the fences of the parks, benches, advertising poles, vendors’ boxes next to the Seine and so many more details.
It’s an elegant touch showing the nobility, I suppose.
One more accent color is red. You see it mainly in cafes which often have that typical Parisian vibe — filled with rounded tables and rattan wicker chairs.
Go up to Galerie Lafayette or Pompidou museum terraces and you’ll see how the color palette changes. The dominant color is grey now, the color of the roofs.
Golden and lime green are some of the colors you’ll meet in sculptures and architectural details walking the streets of the city. They can have a secondary role in the overall look.
There’s more to mention but I’d limit the Paris color palette to these ones.
Main colors:
Accent colors:
Secondary colors:
The weather adds to the perception drastically. Personally, I really enjoy the rainy weather in this habitat (and that’s more than surprising) but once the sun comes up from the clouds the city shines brightly and c’est étonnant. That’s two very different modes and when it comes to colors here’s the comparison:
When it's sunny the buildings have a high contrast to the clear blue sky. While it’s rainy, the overall color palette loses its’ contrast and became more of the same color tone mode.
Is it all to mention regarding the visual perception of the city? Nope, there’s one more thing.
Being very artistic, Paris can be compared to a scene. Each scene has lightning settings and in Paris, they are set to warm light.
This truly brings some sort of magic into the evening views. Together with the Seine or the channel, old architecture, and the sunset sky, the picture looks full and aesthetic.
If on top of that, it rains, you’ll get even more lights thanks to reflection.
Walking the streets of the city we see text all around. In Paris, it has different styles — elegant like the signs of expensive shops, modern for hip areas, or old fashioned for the places with a rich history. Text is also part of the posters both announcing some events and bringing a message from protest rallies (a very common Parisian thing).
While the font styles are as various as the multicultural side of Paris, there exist certain patterns that keep the consistency.
“The metropolitan railroad, in the eyes of most Parisians, will only be excused if it rejects absolutely all industrial character so as to be completely a work of art. Paris must not be made into a factory, it must stay a museum.” — Charles Garnier, architect of the Opera.
And just like that, Paris got art nouveau-styled entries and names of the metro stations both created by Hector Guimard back in the first half of the 20th century.
It adds charms indeed even though right now it’s already more of a rarity. A much more common visual style of the metro was made in more recent times.
In order to unify the sign system of the whole transportation in Paris, the custom Parisine font was created in 1996. The task behind this font was to improve signage legibility and space economy. The custom typeface in Bold was first created based on the proportions of Helvetica Bold, condensed at 90%.
I’m not sure whether the Parisian metro can be named one of the biggest metro systems in the world still, it’s a huge organism and a system that has been evolving through decades. Thus, you can also meet Métro Alphabet font on some stations as all-written-in-caps signs. Also, things like metro maps and navigation on the train stations were made further. Maybe because of different organizations (Paris Transilien is part of SNCF), following the signs in the metro or train stations, you can notice other fonts too like the Achemine typeface introduced in 2008.
Paris is a city I visited quite a few times in the past and being a tourist I certainly tried to stick to my list of places and experiences to do. I saw it as a place full of contrasts but the beautiful side still prevailed.
Once I started to live here I began to discover the deeper layers of the city which I already fait connaissance with. Its’ multicultural side, its’ rich art scene, its’ gourmandise (attention to food), its’ culture, and people.
It’s a place where I felt a huge range of emotions. Where I am still étrangère and where I felt like I fully match its’ lifestyle exploring multiple expositions in the museums or going to a cinema to watch movies from the Cannes festival program.
Certainly, this journey keeps going on and my relations with Paris are evolving. We keep getting to know each other better. No matter how much garbage is on the streets both figuratively and literally (the visual garbage of the shops’ signs and ads vs. garbage caused by strikes) I still see the beauty behind it and it fascinates me.
Part of my love and respect for this city I shared in this article.

Stories of Vince Duqué’s grand experiment to be his authentic self in Paris after a lifetime of drinking the kool-aid of the American Dream

--

You can find my first article in this series, when I was three months out from my move to Paris, here.
“Are you excited about Paris yet?”
It’s an innocent enough question.
I’m pacing around my room while on the phone with my friend Anne: “Nope. Not excited one bit. Paris isn’t real until the visa is real,” I deadpan. It is October 7, and I think I’m unofficially five weeks out from my Paris move. I’m still not fully confident I’m actually going to Paris, actually. I haven’t heard news about my visa since I submitted the application back two weeks ago.
I hope Anne didn’t take my answer as a snarky one. 52 year-old me was trying to be like water and quell the anxiety generated last week by my inner child — the eight-year-old version of me — who had been having a series of micro-meltdowns, worried that my visa application was anything but “foolproof,” even though I bleeping spent €1,900 to make it so. I was still a bit raw from my mom’s passing and the end of my relationship with Sarah, as well as all the purging and the anticipation of all the major changes.
“It’s going to happen,” she assures me. I say nothing. I know she means well. “Why do you think you’ll have an issue?” she asks. I tell her what happened at my visa application appointment.
We FLASHBACK to September 27, the visa appointment at the VFS office:
The young clerk at the VFS office (the third-party company designated to pre-process the applications on their way to the French Consulate in Washington D.C) reviews my application and notes that it is incomplete but that she’d send the application anyway, as-is. “Wait, why are you writing that?” I plead.
“It says here on the checklist that since you are starting a business you need these documents, and you don’t have them.”
“I’m not starting a conventional business in Paris,” I say, “so, I don’t need a copy of a commercial lease agreement or proof of a credit balance from an account.” She takes a few moments to process this, but I can tell by her fidgeting that this situation is deviating from her script. This was probably above her pay grade to solve problems any more than a drive-thru clerk taking orders at a fast-food joint where you can’t have it your way. I give her a curious look that means, “Surely, you’ve dealt with other Profession Libérale visa applications in the past.”
“Since you don’t have the paperwork — even if you say you don’t need them — I can’t cross this off the checklist on the computer, so it won’t show that the application is complete,” she says. “So for me to send the application, I need to write a note.”
I want to pull the good ol’ American I’d like to speak to your supervisor, please, but I don’t want the VFS office to spit in my soup and sabotage my chances for approval. I bite my tongue instead, and tell eight-year-old me, “we’re going to have to trust the process.”
“But I walk out of the office with a massive knot in my stomach, “ I told Anne.
“It’s gonna be great,” she reassures me. I roll my eyes, when I notice an email that just popped up in my in-box, entitled: MISSING DOCUMENTS. It’s from the French Consulate.
“I gotta go.” I hang up the phone. My stomach is in knots again.
I close my eyes, take three deep breaths to keep me from going nuclear, and then open the e-mail.
Please provide the following documents in order to complete processing for your visa application:
- Your last 3 months’ bank statements showing your full name and enough funds to pay for your trip and expenses
- Proof of income related to your business activity in France (letter containing draft work contract with remuneration indicated)
- A housing lease or your host’s property deed
Please carefully read the following instructions on how to respond to this email:
- Please scan these documents directly back to this e-mail address in the next 7 days. Send them all in one email.
- Do not send the documents you already provided at your VFS appointment. We have already reviewed those and have deemed them to be insufficient or inadequate. If you send the same documents again, your visa will likely be denied.
- Only send your documents once and please refrain from writing to inquire if we received your documents. Too many e-mails received disrupt the organization of the visa department and result in longer processing times for applications.
Imagining being spoken by a French bureaucrat, I read the e-mail trying not to be annoyed by the surface politeness disguising the indifference, rigidity, vagueness, and trickiness, all of which French bureaucracy was infamous for. Too late.
“Nooooo!” I scream up to the sky. “I paid two grand for a service to deal with this! And now I have seven days to get the right docs!”
I’m livid. I leave the house for some air. I passed by my 95-year-old grandma in the living room reminding myself that I had yet to tell her I was leaving for Paris.
Why was I so incensed? Before I submitted the application back in September, I scheduled a one-hour consultation call with Franceformation to review my application, but in the actual call, she didn’t review or comment on any of the other parts of my visa application except for the business plan. The entire reason I paid her the exorbitant fee sight unseen was for her allegedly expert eyes to ensure my entire application was foolproof from top to bottom, not just the business plan. I emailed her a message expressing my concern. This was her response:
“ Your supporting documents are fine. Your business plan needs some serious work if you would like it to be accepted in a visa application. I would strongly advise against submitting it without taking into account many of the recommendations I made on our call. Please note that the guarantee included with your package is that I would help you revise and review your visa application again if it does not get approved the first time (this has never happened to any of my clients who followed the Complete French Business Incubator process). If you do not take into account any of my recommendations prior to submitting your application, I will not be providing additional feedback if it is rejected.”
As you can see by the Consulate’s e-mail above, they approved my business plan, which to be clear, I revised on the astute suggestions of expats from Facebook and other friends with expert knowledge, NOT incorporating any of Franceformation’s notes, which were similar in tone and expertise to the kind of advice my father gave me as a 13 year-old regarding how to throw a fastball, having only read a library book called The Official Little League Way to Play Baseball and watched baseball on TV but had never actually played baseball, because well, they didn’t have baseball in the Philippines when he was a kid.
Note that Franceformation stated my “supporting documents are fine,” yet based on the Consulate’s email of my MISSING DOCUMENTS, my supporting documents were clearly NOT fine. Even if she was willing to provide additional feedback, based on every single interaction I had with her, odds were quite high that she was not going to put in the work into my documents besides insisting that her advice was correct, which she was/is infamous for doing on her Facebook group, where, whenever comments go off script, they get deleted.
Thanks to the generosity and experiences of the expats on the Facebook group pages and the TAIP Facebook community, I was able to decipher the Consulate’s requests. My landlord didn’t have immediate access to the property deed, so I sent copies of her electric bill and property tax documentation instead. As far as proof of income, I whipped up contracts with my current clients.
Because I wasn’t confident they would get the stamp of approval, however, until my visa was in my hand, my brain simply would not commit to expending concentrated energy on the move. Even being only five weeks out, I put off my Paris to-do list and allocated most of my time either continuing my Goodbye L.A. tour or being a Dodger fan watching every inning of their playoff games either on TV or watching games at Dodger Stadium until they finally lost in the National League Championship Series, which I secretly hoped would happen, because Dodger baseball alone ate up at least sixty hours. I spent sixty hours training tennis at Silva Tennis Academy as well.
Every day, I’d spend hours checking my email and social media accounts for signs of my ex-girlfriend Sarah, hoping that she’d get in touch with me to see each other before leaving for Paris. It was horribly co-dependent of me, but that’s what it was.
Live music ate up another sixty hours, because with all the deaths, Covid, and purging that had happened this year, live music was my church. In addition to a series of local acts at the Hotel Café, I saw Pearl Jam and the Lumineers a few weeks ago and saw Wilco twice in October. The lyrics from “ Shot in the Arm,” Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm, and What you once were isn’t what you want to be anymore… totally encapsulated why I was moving to Paris. I played that song every day on repeat as I waited for my visa…
The consulate sent me an e-mail merely notifying me that a FedEx package was on its way to me. They didn’t indicate whether my application was approved.
No matter. The most important FedEx package of my life containing the prospects of my future is due to arrive in my lap in less than three hours. I’ve cleared my entire schedule for the day to be home to sign for the package. After a couple hours go by, I receive a text that FedEx tried to deliver the package, but I was not home, and they would attempt a second delivery the following day. Actually, I am home, but they didn’t bother to call. I want to scream.
What occurs next is a series of tragically comedic events in which I talk to three different customer service representatives for over five cumulative hours — all outsourced to call centers in other countries merely reading a script — to directly manage the delivery. I don’t trust their delivery process. The next morning, I drive fifteen miles to the FedEx facility.
Finally, the moment of truth is in my hand. It is anti-climactic, really, this nondescript FedEx envelope that held the promise of the rest of my life. I rip open the envelope. There’s nothing inside except my original passport. I brace myself for rejection and get ready to tell my inner child a narrative that the Universe is telling us it isn’t yet our time for Paris, then get my assistant director part of my brain to get past the disappointment quickly in order to plan for potential scenarios. I open the passport…and there it is, my profession libérale visa. I break into tears of relief and joy. It’s happening. I’m finally going to Paris. I am officially thirty days out.
I call Anne back. “Okay, now I’m excited.” “But just a little,” I added.
After I got my visa, urgency was everything. I booked my flight for November 16, four weeks from that moment. I secured a place for my cat Maddey on the plane. I confirmed my Airbnb reservations. I reviewed the procedures to obtain Maddey’s health certificate. I finally took the new suitcase I bought months ago out of the shipping box and laid it out with my two other suitcases.
Twenty days before my November 16th flight, my grandma was in the kitchen eating a Filipino dish of cow liver and rice when I finally told her I was moving to Paris. “Huh? Where are you going?” she asked in her shrill — Filipina from the poor province — laden accent. Her hearing was severely diminished, and she was too stubborn to wear a hearing aid.
“Paris,” I said.
“Where?”
“Paris.”
“Where?”
“France.”
“Frince?”
“France.”
“Frunce?”
“FRANCE.”
“Oh. France. That’s far.”
“Yes it is.”
“How long you going?”
“I’m not sure. A long time, probably.”
“Three months?”
“Probably longer.”
“Oh, so you don’t stay here anymore?”
“No, grandma.”
She started laughing. “Oh, maybe you stay there for a year!” More laughing. I wasn’t sure why she found all of this funny, but I said, “Yes, grandma, for a year.” And with that, she went back to the TV and started flipping channels. In retrospect, I don’t think she knew how to process the news that I was leaving. She was incapable of processing with nuance. At least outwardly.
After my mom’s stroke this year and enduring the trauma of not being given the chance to reconcile my relationship with her, I moved in with my grandma as a sentimental gesture to connect and say farewell after I was forced to leave the home Sarah and I made together. Grandma is 95 years old, and she just isn’t moving well anymore. We have cousins and aunts who will look after her, but I’m the grandchild of two closest to her. My sister lives two hours south in San Diego but she has her hands full. Besides, my grandma doesn’t trust my sister after the way she handled the responsibility as the executor of the power of attorney over my mom’s affairs. I feel horrible that I’m leaving grandma for Paris, but everyday I’m here, I’m losing more of my sanity, and I simply need to leave if I’m going to stay alive. Not kidding. I gave her a hug, she hugged me back, and as my emotions started to stir and make me feel raw again, I disappeared into the garage with my nose back to the grindstone and turned on a little Wilco to get me through a tedious night of deciding what was going to make it into the five pieces of luggage that would be my Paris life.

INTRODUCTION
Paris, the City of Lights. Many couples’ idea of a romantic location. So why is it the only city on my sh*t list, then?
Read on to find out.
ARRIVING IN PARIS
I was traveling with my girlfriend. Paris was one of the cities on our itinerary. we had three days and three nights to spend there.
This was an easy and unchallenging environment for us to visit as tourists, for a number of reasons. First, I’m a native French speaker, and she happened to be fluent in the language as well, having completed her high school studies in an international French school.
Second, we were both from so-called Western countries, so already somewhat familiar with French food and customs.
So what could go wrong, right?
THE EXPERIENCE THAT LEFT ME UNIMPRESSED
After we’d checked into our hotel we went out walking around our neighborhood to find somewhere to eat dinner.
I can’t remember where we ended up exactly, but it was something like a pub. I recall that it was somewhat dark and there was a bar close to the entrance. Whatever we ate was okay, but completely forgettable. Somewhat pricey, but not unexpected given that this was Paris.
We finished eating around 8:00–8:30 p.m., a pretty typical time for dinner by French standards.
Then came time to pay. Our bill cost 35 EUR (around US$50, at the time), and I gave a 100 EUR note. It took the cashier/bartender a good minute to figure out how much change to give me, and that’s including using a calculator! UGH.
I had always heard, in the news and from French people I’d met personally (like at my French meetup group, for example) that the French High School curriculum was more advanced in math and science than the North American one. So this was a little shocking, but I chalked it up to her perhaps having had a long day and simply being tired.
But what sealed the deal in terms of making this a bad experience for us, was that she proceeded to tell us that they didn’t have enough change for us (and bear in mind that this restaurant was still open and accepting customers - it’s not like it was the end of the day for them.)
And, so, another employee had to run out to a little shop across the street to get change. He came back about five minutes later, at which point we were finally able to get on with our evening.
Pretty lame.
THE EXPERIENCE THAT LEFT US DISGUSTED
We wanted to visit the famous Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral, so we hopped onto the metro and exited at the stop nearest to the cathedral. This station was located only a few minutes away from it by foot. It was busy and situated in a very popular, highly visited tourist area.
In this case, our dismay came from the general state that the metro station and its immediate surroundings were in. There was a smell of pee as we were walking out and around to the front. We spotted some big rats foraging, used condoms and empty alcohol bottles on the ground, and possibly a homeless problem in the area. The whole place basically gave the impression that it was generally very dirty and unkept-looking.
Enough said.
THE “DON’T BELIEVE THE HYPE” EXPERIENCE:
It was time to have dinner again. and we had made our way to a restaurant that I had found during my initial research and planning stage, prior to landing in the country.
It was a highly-rated mid-range restaurant owned by a famous chef. We chose one of the signature dishes. All I remember is that it had l some lobster in it… might have been a bisque. It cost us somewhere around 50 EUR.
The taste was underwhelming at best and the serving size was very small. More like an appetizer, despite being listed as a main. I was still very hungry afterward and ended up going to a bakery nearby to buy a couple of croissants to eat as soon as we left the restaurant.
What a rip-off, in taste AND in price!
THE “WATCH OUT FOR THE UNCIVILIZED CROOK” EXPERIENCE:
It was the afternoon, probably on Sunday during our 3-day long weekend trip to Paris. We were about to get on the Metro, after having spent a minute asking for directions from the booth attendant who worked right next to the entrance gates.
We’d purchased our one-way tickets, at an exorbitant price of 5 EUR each. I seem to remember that the price was perhaps a little higher on weekends, for some reason.
So my girlfriend went through the turnstile entrance and waited for me on the other side. There were a couple of people in front of me and then came my turn. I put in my ticket, started pushing the rotating metal bars, and immediately felt someone shoving themselves behind and pushing me to try and go through at the same time.
This French man must have noticed that we were tourists beforehand, and thought that he could get away with it as I would be caught by surprise and wouldn’t be able to speak up in French either…
Wrong on both counts.
I immediately turned around, looked at him, and pushed him back solidly with an open hand while exclaiming something like “What the hell are you doing?!” in French. He was definitely taken aback, clearly unused to people preventing his little scam from working.
I joined my girlfriend and we walked a few meters down the tunnel. we came to a split and were unsure which direction to take so we stopped to look at our subway map, which I think was in the form of a smartphone APP that I had.
Shortly after, the same man who had tried to scam his way in for free caught up with us and started yelling some insults at me and acting like he wanted to fight. I yelled something back along the lines of “What’s your problem?” while taking my backpack off and putting it down in case he was going to try to swing at me.
He was still standing at a distance of about 3 meters away, and, at that moment, a random man who was passing by and had noticed this idiot’s behavior told him to calm down and not get involved like this with tourists, or some such.
Lucky for him. My girlfriend had witnessed everything that had happened up to this point and she knew that this guy was in the wrong. We certainly weren’t looking for trouble, but I would have been fully in my right to defend myself had I needed to.
THE “YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME” EXPERIENCE:
It’s the afternoon and we were on our way to someplace called The Museum of Magic. it was around 2 p.m. and we had been walking for a while.
I was getting hungry. We spotted a nice-looking café and stepped inside to see if I could grab a snack. The place was packed and there literally was nowhere to sit So I had to take my food to go. I bought two slices of coconut cream pie.
We stepped back outside and I proceeded to eat the pie on our way to the museum and drank some bottled water as usual. We had a good visit to the museum but, shortly after getting out, I started feeling ill in my stomach.
We ended up having to rush back to our hotel room, and I proceeded to be sick from food poisoning for the rest of the day, being unable to go out until the following morning.
Now… I’m not sensitive, don't have any allergies, and can eat just about any food. And there was absolutely no doubt in my mind that what made me sick was the coconut pie that I had gotten in the middle of the afternoon from that busy café.
And up to that point - in fact, up until now - this is the only case of food poisoning I’ve ever gotten during my travels as a tourist. And this includes visiting various cities in Asia and Europe, where I ate my way through night markets and other street foods, among other things.
CONCLUSION
In any city around the world and particularly those where tourism brings in a lot of revenue, you would expect that the city’s management, its businesses, and its people would do the best they can to put a good foot forward and make the best first impression possible on tourists. Especially when talking about such a high-profile city as Paris.
Unfortunately, however, this isn’t what I noted when I was there. instead, I experienced quite a few distinct bad things in the same, short 3-day weekend time frame.
Rather disappointing, wouldn’t you say?
And this is why Paris is, to this day, still the one and only foreign city on my sh*t list. I will never set foot there again, although I wouldn’t be opposed to going back to a different area of France if the opportunity presented itself at some point in the future.
Q. have you had bad travel experiences?
All the best,
Pascal

Day by day, I scroll through social media, gazing at photos of Paris. The Paris I see in these glossy portfolios is my Paris. And, again, it’s not. I see few images of the banlieues, Belleville, Drancy, or the blocks of high rises flanking the highway from Charles De Gaulle airport to the center of Paris.
And another thing about Paris today that has changed since my very first foray through Paris by car, without a map, just a sort of by guess and by gosh, with a few prayers thrown in.
The lines, the crowds, the shorts, the tank tops, the grinning faces, the selfies.
Although there’s Disneyland Paris, I cannot imagine going to the center of Western culture and wasting my time at Disneyland.
Now Paris may mean a lot of things to a lot of people. Disneyland Paris is not one of them. At least not for me.
The lines, the crowds, the shorts, the tank tops, the grinning faces, the selfies.
But Paris is worth a mass, as Henri IV, or Henri of Navarre quipped. Henri became a Catholic so he could become king. Put in more secular terms, Paris is worth standing in lines for the Louvre or the Orsay or any number of other historical landmarks, giving up valuable time for something greater, larger, and ultimately longer lasting.
I discovered a copy of Don’t Be a Tourist in Paris in the apartment I rented in the 15th Arrondissement on my last trip to Paris. Unfortunately, there’s no Kindle version. This 368-page book weighs 2.15 pounds, hardly the thing to haul up the many steps to Montmartre or during a grand tour of the Louvre or even a leisurely evening on one of the Bateaux Mouches on the Seine.
On a recent trip to Paris, I explored a unique museum, at 23 Rue de Sévigné, the Hôtel des Ligneris (also known as the Musée Carnavalet), dedicated to the history of Paris. The crowds were manageable. I enjoyed being in the Marais, where I bought a chocolate brownie-like thing at the Boulangerie Muricano at 16 rue des Rosiers. The dark history of this area under the Nazis was never far from my thoughts, though.
Of course, I missed so much, including the Musée d’Edith Piaf. Maybe next time.
In a roundabout way, I did pay tribute to “la môme piaf” (The Little Sparrow), as Piaf’s fans called her.
Every time I visit Paris, I make my way to one of the most famous cemeteries in the world, the Père Lachaise cemetery.
And there she was. Nestled among so many Parisian greats that it would take days to comb through all the trails and byways of this immense monument to the dead souls of Paris.
Just listen.
For all of you who love Paris, but now prefer to armchair travel for whatever reason, you will find treasure in the pages of Don’t Be a Tourist in Paris.
I certainly do!

In this article, I expect the reader to be familiar with The Sun Also Rises, Ernest Hemingway’s first novel, published in 1926. So, I will not discuss the plot, main characters, and their motivations. Eventually, there is tons of literature on this subject, from which it is worth highlighting Everybody Behaves Badly: The True Story Behind Hemingway’s Masterpiece The Sun Also Rises by Lesley M. M. Blume.
Disclaimer: In this amateur inquiry, I tried to discover as many Paris places as possible that the book’s main characters have presumably visited. The following text does not claim to be entirely truthful, despite my efforts to verify most of my assumptions, and may contain inaccurate data.
Spanish places from the second part of the book are represented in my next article, «Spain in Hemingway’s The Sun Also Rises».
adequatica.medium.com
The places are arranged in the order of their first appearance in the text.
Table of contents:
The points of interest appear immediately in the first chapter, but these mentioned places may presumably be fictional; at least, these establishments are not possible to identify through Googling:
We had dined at l’Avenue’s and afterward went to the Café de Versailles for coffee. [Book 1 — Chapter 01]
Afterward, Hemingway became more precise in indicating the existing locations.
1 Boulevard des Capucines
In the second and third chapters, Jake Barnes and Robert Cohn have a drink here.
We went out to the Café Napolitain to have an apéritif and watch the evening crowd on the Boulevard. [1–02]
A café with this name existed on 1, Boulevard des Capucines. In the 1920s, pavement cafés like this were frequented by many famous artists and writers, such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Gauguin, Pablo Picasso, Gertrude Stein, Joan Miró, and Ezra Pound [1]. In the contemporary restaurant, you can still order Pernod (a producer of pastis), as Jake Barnes did, as an apéritif for around € 4.
«Well, what will you drink?» I asked.«Pernod.» [1–03]
After Jake finished his drinks with Robert, he picked up Georgette — «a good-looking girl walked past the table.» From Napolitan, they went to a restaurant in a horse-drawn cab. Their path is described in sufficient detail through the first part of the third chapter, but I had to rely on Google Maps algorithms to build the route for the rest of the undescribed path.
Jake and Georgette go by cab to the restaurant: café Napolitan → move up the Avenue de l’Opéra → pass the New York Herald bureau (49, Avenue de l’Opéra) → turn off the Avenue up the Rue des Pyramides → through the traffic of the Rue de Rivoli → through a dark gate into the Tuileries → come out of the Tuileries into the light and crossed the Seine → turn up the Rue des Saints Pères → Madame Lavigne’s restaurant.
It is noteworthy that the New York Herald was the first newspaper that Jake bought when he got back to France after the fiesta.
At a newspaper kiosque I bought a copy of the New York Herald and sat in a café to read it. It felt strange to be in France again. [Book 3 — Chapter 19]
159 Boulevard du Montparnasse
Here, Jake Barnes and Georgette came for dinner. Instead of naming the place, Hemingway named the proprietor of the restaurant: Madame Lavigne. In the 1920s, Monsieur and Madame Lavigne owned a place named Nègre de Toulouse [2]. Moreover, the first version of the manuscript contained more details: «By this time we were on the Boulevard Montparnasse and I called to the cocher to stop at Lavigne’s restaurant, Le Negre de Toulouse.» [3].
By this time we were at the restaurant. I called to the cocher to stop. We got out and Georgette did not like the looks of the place. <…> We went into the restaurant, passed Madame Lavigne at the desk and into a little room. [1–03]
There, they met a group of Jake’s friends: Robert Cohn, Frances Clyne, Mrs. Braddocks, and several other people. After dinner, the whole company decided to move to a bal musette for dancing.
46 Rue de la Montagne Saint Geneviève
The dancing-club was a bal musette in the Rue de la Montagne Sainte Geneviève. Five nights a week the working people of the Pantheon quarter danced there. One night a week it was the dancing-club. On Monday nights it was closed. When we arrived it was quite empty,… [1–03]
Hemingway left this place unnamed, but on this street of the Latin Quarter [4], there was only one famous place of its kind: Bal de la Montagne. It was opened in 1908 and was a quite popular dance hall, especially in 1930 among the homosexual subculture [5]. In the 1970s, it became a place for rock’n’roll hangouts and worked under the name of La Bulle, but now it operates as an ordinary bar, Le Violon Dingue [6], with a late-night club in the basement. Nowadays, shots of alcohol start from € 4.
Jake Barnes meets Lady Brett Ashley in a group of young guys. Both (Jake and Brett) decide to get out of the dancing club and go somewhere together in a taxi.
I told the driver to go to the Parc Montsouris, and got in, and slammed the door. [1–03]
2 Rue Gazan
Jake and Brett came here late at night in a taxi after the dancing club. Again, Hemingway provides a detailed description only of the beginning of their route. After Avenue des Gobelin, I had to rely on Google Maps algorithms to determine the final part of the way to the park.
Jake and Brett go by taxi to the park: bal musette → up the hill behind Saint-Étienne-du-Mont → pass the trees and the standing bus at the Place de la Contrescarpe → turn onto the cobbles of the Rue Mouffetard → came out on the Avenue des Gobelin → Parc Montsouris.
After coming there, they found a closed restaurant near the park and decided to move on.
On the right was the Parc Montsouris. The restaurant where they have the pool of live trout and where you can sit and look out over the park was closed and dark.<…>«Where do you want to go?» I asked. Brett turned her head away.«Oh, go to the Select.»«Café Select,» I told the driver. «Boulevard Montparnasse.» [1–04]
99 Boulevard du Montparnasse
Le Select is a quintessential Parisian cafe founded over 100 years ago (1923). In 1925, it reoriented into an «American bar» and stayed open all night [7], which attracted expatriates, artists, and intellectuals of that era, including Pablo Picasso, Jean Cocteau, Max Jacob, Henri Miller, and Scott Fitzgerald. To this day, celebrities like Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson [8] continue to visit this café.
In The Sun Also Rises, when Jake and Brett came in, «against the bar and at tables, were most of the crowd who a been at the dance.» After a while, Jake decided to leave.
His way back home was quite straightforward: along the Boulevard du Montparnasse until the Boulevard Saint-Michel. Hemingway did not specify Jake’s home address; he only mentioned that his flat «was just across the street, a little way down the Boulevard St. Michel.» Actually, it was in the opposite direction where the writer himself lived at that time (in the flat above the sawmill, 113, Rue Notre Dame des Champs) [9].
Jake walks back home: Le Select → goes out onto the sidewalk → walks down toward the Boulevard St. Michel → passes the tables of the Rotonde → looks across the street at the Dôme → Lavigne’s (Nègre de Toulouse) → Closerie des Lilas → passes Ney’s statue → crosses the street → a little way down the Boulevard St. Michel.
To see Ney’s statue «among the new-leaved chestnut-trees in the arc-light» and read the inscription on the monument, as Jake did, you need to go around the corner. Therefore, he could not cross the street immediately after the end of Boulevard Montparnasse, so that is why my route crosses the boulevard a little further.
The next time, Jake Barnes met here his cynical buddy Harvey Stone, and then Robert Cohn joined them. Jake and Harvey had two ports (Porto wine), which is still served in the Select for € 7,90.
Anyhow, we were sitting on the terrace of the Café Select,… [1–06]
In the sixth chapter, after Jake had finished the evening in Select, he left the bar through the side door, stepped out to Rue Vavin, and headed towards Boulevard Raspail: «I went down a side street to the Boulevard Raspail. A taxi came along and I got in and gave the driver the address of my flat.» — it was not the usual way home, as it was in the fourth chapter.
In the eighth chapter, Jake and Bill Gorton came here for a meeting with Brett and her fiancé, Mike Campbell.
«Mind you’re at the Select around ten. Make him come. Michael will be there.»<…>…, past its lights and tables to the Select.Michael came toward us from the tables. He was tanned and healthy-looking. <…> Bill had gone into the bar. He was standing talking with Brett, who was sitting on a high stool, her legs crossed. [Book 2 — Chapter 8]
All the above restaurants, Rotonde, Dôme, and Closerie des Lilas, were extremely popular establishments at that time and still are. My long article «Hemingway in Paris: A definitive guide to Ernest Hemingway’s Paris» presents more similar places.
37 Quai d’Orsay
The next morning, at the very beginning of the fifth chapter, Jake Barnes went to the office. The reader can guess from the text that the main character is a journalist, but the writer does not disclose what newspaper he works for or the exact addresses of the editorial office. This can be guessed from Hemingway’s biography: between 1921 and 1923, he worked as a journalist for the Toronto Star Weekly [10], but the location of the office and whether it was remains unclear. Seems to be near Opéra Garnier, presumably somewhere near Boulevard des Italiens.
In the morning I walked down the Boulevard to the rue Soufflot for coffee and brioche. <…> I got on an S bus and rode down to the Madeleine, <…> From the Madeleine I walked along the Boulevard des Capucines to the Opéra, and up to my office. <…> I walked across the avenue and turned in to my office. [1–05]
Jake commutes to the office: Boulevard St. Michel → Rue Soufflot → takes S bus to the Madeleine [11] → walks along the Boulevard des Capucines to the Opéra → crosses the avenue (Avenue de l’Opéra) and turns into the office.
Yet, there is a place with an exactly defined location. On the same day, he took a taxi to Quai d’Orsay to listen to the foreign office speaker, «a young Nouvelle Revue Française diplomat in horn-rimmed spectacles, talked and answered questions for half an hour.» That was a direct journalistic activity for covering international diplomatic events, and the place is not a book fiction. At number 37, Quai d’Orsay is located French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs.
10 Rue Delambre
On the way back to the office, Jake shared a taxi with colleagues Woolsey and Krum. During the conversation, one mentioned the Dingo American Bar and Restaurant.
«I’m coming over some night. The Dingo. That’s the great place, isn’t it?» [1–05]
In the ninth chapter, Jake found Mike Campbell and Brett here before leaving for Pamplona.
The same evening about seven o’clock I stopped in at the Select to see Michael and Brett. They were not there, and I went over to the Dingo. They were inside sitting at the bar. [2–09]
In the Roaring Twenties, it was a new drinking establishment (opened in 1923) among English-speaking expats. As Hemingway wrote in The Movable Feast, it is here that he first met Scott Fitzgerald.
Despite the fact that it is now an Italian restaurant (since 1989), the bar inside has been preserved from the original times [12].
L’Auberge de Venise Montparnasse’s commemorative plaque says: «Previously, this place was the famous DINGO American Bar & Restaurant, run by Louis Wilson and his sidekick Jimmie Charters. It was at the bar of this restaurant (the bar is original) that Ernest Hemmingway invented some of the many cocktails described in his novels, including the delicious Long Island Iced Tea.» Today, the Long Island Iced Tea cocktail costs € 13.
5 Place de l’Opéra
In the fifth chapter, Jake met Robert Cohn at the office near Opéra and they decided to go out for lunch. The chosen restaurant is very likely fictional because no place with a similar name exists around that area.
«Where do you want to eat?»«How about Wetzel’s? They’ve got good hors d’œuvres.» [1–05]
But after lunch, they moved to a very specific place.
After we finished the lunch we walked up to the Café de la Paix and had coffee. [1–05]
Ernest Hemingway and his first wife, Hadley Richardson, ate there on their first Christmas in Paris in 1921. Café de la Paix opened in 1862 and was famous much earlier than the new-fangled bars from Montparnasse [7]. It was visited by Émile Zola, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Guy de Maupassant, Sergei Diaghilev and Oscar Wilde.
Café crème on the Paix’s terrace will cost you € 11; it is quite expensive.
10 Place de la Concorde
At the beginning of the sixth chapter Jake Barnes was waiting in the lobby for his lover, Lady Brett Ashley.
At five o’clock I was in the Hotel Crillon waiting for Brett. She was not there, so I sat down and wrote some letters. They were not very good letters but I hoped their being on Crillon stationery would help them. [1–06]
After a while, he went down to the bar to grab a cocktail: «…about quarter to six, I went down to the bar and had a Jake Rose with George, the barman. Brett had not been in the bar either…»
Bill Gorton, as he told Jake in the eighth chapter, also stopped in Crillon for a drink.
«Where were you drinking?»«Stopped at the Crillon. George made me a couple of Jake Roses. George’s a great man.» [2–08]
The contemporary luxury 5-star Hôtel de Crillon still operates in the same building; suites start from € 3,500 per night.
105 Boulevard du Montparnasse
The text only mentions Café de la Rotonde in passing a few times.
…, and took a taxi to the Café Select. <…> The taxi stopped in front of the Rotonde. No matter what café in Montparnasse you ask a taxi-driver to bring you to from the right bank of the river, they always take you to the Rotonde. Ten years from now it will probably be the Dome. It was near enough, anyway. I walked past the sad tables of the Rotonde to the Select. [1–06]
La Rotonde, along with Le Dôme, is a famous restaurant on Montparnasse [13]. It was frequented by artists and painters, including Picasso, Modigliani, Jean Cocteau, Diego Rivera, Tsuguharu Foujita, Alexandre Jacovleff, etc. Nowadays, celebrities and politicians continue to visit the Rotonde; even the President of France is seen there [14].
Hemingway was not a fan of this place because of too much bohemian public. That is why he sent his hero to the Select.
5 rue Danou
This bar was opened in 1911 by American jockey Tod Sloan and was simply called The New York Bar. In 1923, the current bartender, Harry MacElhone, bought the place and added his name to the title [15]. In the following years, New York Bar became the point of attraction for American expatriates like Ernest Hemingway and passing celebrities like Humphrey Bogart and Rita Hayworth. George Gershwin composed «An American in Paris» on the piano in the upstairs [16].
It was three days ago that Harvey had won two hundred francs from me shaking poker dice in the New York Bar. [1–06]
In the late 1910s, a young Fernand Petiot worked there as a bartender and later became famous for inventing the Bloody Mary [17]. Now, at Harry’s, this classic cocktail costs € 16.
108 Boulevard du Montparnasse
While Jake and Robert Cohn were sitting on the Select’s terrace, Robert was waiting for Frances Clyne. After her appearance, she asked Jake for a private conversation across the street — to the Dôme.
«Would you come over with me to the Dome? <…> Come on, Jake.»We crossed the Boulevard Montparnasse and sat down at a table. [1–06]
Le Dôme or Café du Dôme was a popular restaurant at the beginning of the last century and is still popular today (today it is a top fish restaurant). It was opened in 1898 and did not look trendy for Hemingway in the 1920s at the time of «American bars» like Dingo, Le Select, and La Coupole. Nevertheless, he did not disdain going there and even devoted an entire chapter of A Movable Feast to his meeting with the painter Jules Pascin [18].
171 Boulevard du Montparnasse
The main characters appear here several times. In the sixth chapter, Jake did not succeed in getting to Lilas due to sudden encounters.
«Come on up to the Lilas,» I said.«I have a date.» [1–06]
But for the second time, he got there by taxi with Bill Gordon and Brett.
«Stop at the nearest bistro,» I said.«We might as well go to the Closerie,» Brett said. «I can’t drink these rotten brandies.»«Closerie des Lilas.»<…>Sitting out on the terraces of the Lilas Brett ordered a whiskey and soda, I took one, too, and Bill took another pernod. [2–08]
Closerie des Lilas is one of the oldest establishments on Montparnasse [19], frequented by Émile Zola, Ford Maddox Ford, Francis Scott Fitzgerald, Henry Miller, Samuel Beckett, Man Ray, Ezra Pound, and many others. It started operating in 1847, and by our days, it has turned into an expensive restaurant. Their menu includes a pan-fried fillet of beef «Hemingway» style with french fries for € 52.
When Lilas was an ordinary café, it was Ernest Hemingway’s favorite place. Sometimes, he worked there, away from the crowded tourist establishments of the rest of Montparnasse.
Bois de Bolulogne, Paris, France
Former royal hunting grounds are now a huge public park with lakes and nature trails.
In the seventh chapter, Jake, Brett, and Count Mippipopolous went there for dinner. The Count had a car with a driver, so it was not a problem for them to go to the outskirts of Paris.
«We’ll want to ride out to the Bois for dinner?»<…>We dined at a restaurant in the Bois. It was a good dinner. [1–07]
Hemingway did not provide the name of the restaurant, and it is extremely erroneous to guess what exactly this place was. For example, there are at least two Michelin-starred restaurants in the Bois de Boulogne right now: La Grande Cascade and Le Pré Catelan, both of which existed in the 1920s [20].
Maybe it could be Le Pré Catelan because Count Mippipopolous ordered an expensive bottle of brandy from eighteen eleven, and this restaurant has a wine cellar of more than 30,000 bottles [21].
16 Bis Rue Pierre Fontaine
The company of Jake, Brett, and Count Mippipopolous headed here after dinner in the Bois’s restaurant.
Finally we went up to Montmartre. Inside Zelli’s it was crowded, smoky, and noisy. The music hit you as you went in. [1–07]
During the Jazz Age, Montmartre was full of jazz and dancing clubs [23]. The most popular one, especially among Americans, was Joe Zelli’s club — Zelli’s Royal Box [24]. It was the only club with a permit to operate after midnight [25]. One way or another, the history of jazz is another area of research that stands apart from Hemingway’s studies.
103 Boulevard Saint-Michel
In the eighth chapter, Jake and Bill Gorton started their way to dinner at Jake’s flat somewhere at Boulevard Saint-Michel. And there there is a tricky part in the text:
We walked down the Boulevard. At the juncture of the Rue Denfert-Rochereau with the Boulevard is a statue of two men in flowing robes.«I know who they are.» Bill eyed the monument. «Gentlemen who invented pharmacy. Don’t try and fool me on Paris.» [2–08]
First of all, Rue Denfert-Rochereau is actually an Avenue Denfert-Rochereau. Secondly, it doesn’t connect to Boulevard Saint-Michel (either the streets have changed in 100 years, or Hemingway was mistaken) [26]. Thirdly, the monument they were talking about existed, but it was standing on the intersection of Boulevard Saint-Michel and Rue de l’Abbé de l’Épée.
The initial monument to Joseph Bienaimé Caventou and Pierre Joseph Pelletier — French chemists and pharmacists — was erected on that crossroad in 1900 [27], but in 1942, the bronze statue was melted down under the Vichy regime. In 1951, the monument was reopened as a fountain with a reclining figure on a plinth [28].
Thereby, Bill could have made a remark about the old one. However, you can take the same route along this monument in a new form.
33 Quai d’Anjou
In the same eighth chapter, where Jake and Gill decided «to eat on the island», their way to the place was not trivial: Jake’s flat on Boulevard St. Michel → walk down the Boulevard → «statue of two men in flowing robes» (The Pelletier and Caventou Monument) → stop for a drink (without a specific location) → again down the Boulevard → a sudden meeting with Brett and back to Closerie des Lilas on a taxi → way down to the Île Saint-Louis on a taxi.
The spot on the island was the establishment that was run by the cook Pascaline Lecomte and her husband from 1904 to 1928 (it eventually closed in 1953). Meals were taken at the marble table, the cutlery was made of metal, and the bill was presented on a large slate. Besides Hemingway, John Dos Passos, Louis Aragon, Georges Simenon (who set about fifteen of his novels on the Île Saint-Louis), and Louis-Ferdinand Céline had dinner here [29].
Jake Barnes and Bill Gordon came to Au Rendez-Vous des Mariniers to eat «in the warm June evening», too.
We ate dinner at Madame Lecomte’s restaurant on the far side of the island. It was crowded with Americans and we had to stand up and wait for a place. <…> Bill had eaten at the restaurant in 1918, and right after the armistice, and Madame Lecomte made a great fuss over seeing him. [2–08]
After the dinner, Jake and Bill had a tremendous walk on the left bank before meeting with Brett «at the Select around ten».
Jake and Bill go out: Madame Lecomte’s restaurant (Au Rendez-Vous des Mariniers, (A) on the map) → walk along Quai d’Orléans and circle the island → cross to the left bank of the Seine from the Quai de Béthune → stop on the bridge (Pont de la Tournelle) and look down the river at Notre-Dame de Paris (B) → cross the bridge and walk up the Rue du Cardinal Lemoine → Place de la Contrescarpe (C) → Negre Joyeux and Café des Amateurs → turn to the right off the Place de la Contrescarpe → Rue du Pot de Fer (D) → Rue Saint-Jacques and then walk south (E) → Val-de-Grâce → «set back behind the courtyard and the iron fence» (F) → Boulevard de Port-Royal (G) → walked along Port-Royal until it becomes Montparnasse (H) → pass «Lilas, Lavigne’s, and all the little cafés, Damoy’s» → cross the street (Boulevard Raspail) to the Rotonde (I) → Le Select (J).
There are several ambiguities in this route. First, where did they turn off the square Place de la Contrescarpe? Because they went up from the side of the Rue du Cardinal Lemoine street, then «to the right» could mean a narrow Rue Blainville street: «We turned to the right off the Place Contrescarpe, walking along smooth narrow streets with high old houses on both sides.» After that, they have to make a few turns (corresponding to the text to the text = streets) to get to the Rue du Pot de Fer.
Second, Rue du Pot de Fer does not intersect with Rue Saint-Jacques, so they could not go straight through, as given in the text: «We came onto the Rue du Pot de Fer and followed it along until it brought us to the rigid north and south of the Rue Saint Jacques and then walked south…» Most likely, Hemingway omitted the details that they have to walk through several alleys more.
And lastly, among the listed cafés in Montparnasse, the Damoy’s remains a mystery. I have not found any mentions of it anywhere else.
Place de la Contrescarpe
In the fourth chapter, Jake has already passed by this square in a taxi with Brett; in the eighth chapter, he got there on foot with Bill.
It was steep walking, and we went all the way up to the Place Contrescarpe. The arc-light shone through the leaves of the trees in the square, and underneath the trees was an S bus ready to start. [2–08]
The steep street they were walking up was very familiar to the author. During his first stay in Paris, Ernest Hemingway lived here for a year and a half at 74 Rue de Cardinal Lemoine [31]. His flat was almost around the corner of the Place de la Contrescarpe [32].
14 Rue Mouffetard
In the eighth chapter, when Jake and Bill found themselves in the square Place de la Contrescarpe. Hemingway gave a brief description of a few of its remarkable establishments.
Music came out of the door of the Negre Joyeux. [2–08]
A «Merry Negro» is a former Parisian café store. Its sign was removed in 2018 by the prescription of Paris City Hall due to its controversial image [33].
2 Place de la Contrescarpe
Through the window of the Café Aux Amateurs I saw the long zinc bar. Outside on the terrace working people were drinking. In the open kitchen of the Amateurs a girl was cooking potato-chips in oil. <…> The girl ladled some onto a plate for an old man who stood holding a bottle of red wine in one hand. [2–08]
In The Moveable Feast, Hemingway called it «the cesspool of the Rue Mouffetard» and avoided this place because it attracted only drunks, whores, and ruffians from the nearest street market. Maybe that is why his heroes decided to skip a drink here.
«Want to have a drink?»«No,» said Bill. «I don’t need it.» [2–08]
Now, it is occupied by Cafè Delmas, which was previously called La Chope [34], and has lost its inheritance as a place for working people.
According to their menu, french fries are no longer served as a separate dish (only with a burger for € 19), and a bottle of wine starts from € 25.
Esplanade Valéry Giscard d’Estaing
In the ninth chapter, on the Saturday morning of the 25th of June, Jake and Bill left Paris towards Bayonne on a train from Gare d’Orsay.
Bill and I took the morning train from the Gare d’Orsay. [2–09]
Gare d’Orsay terminal has served trains for the Paris-Orléans Railway since its opening in 1900. I did not dive deep into railroad lore about whether it was possible to get to Bayonne without a transfer in the 1920s or whether Hemingway accurately sent his heroes by train in this direction.
In 1986, it was reopened as the Musée d’Orsay, an art museum. Admission is € 16.

Helping You Adapt to Life in France

--
Listen
Share
I’ve lived in France on and off since 2014. I’m often asked, “How did you do it?” The short answer is a lot of determination and a refusal to take non as an answer. But, I know a lot of our TAIP readers hope to live in France permanently one day (or are already here and want to know how to stay), so I want to share, step-by-step, my own journey to France and how I made it all work.
Let’s get right into it.
I never imagined I’d ever study abroad, never mind live abroad. One day, when I was still in Rhode Island completing my undergrad, a friend of mine had to pick up some paperwork from the study abroad office. We had plans after so I decided to tag along. While I waited for her, an advisor approached me and asked if I was interested in learning more about my options. I shrugged and said, “Why not?” (if you’ve been in France a while, you’ll also find that this is a very frequently used idiom that indicates French willingness to try something new…another topic for another article) and joined him in his office.
I was studying fashion merchandising at the time, so after taking a look at my transcript he told me that my best options would be Milan or Paris. Was I interested in leaving for an entire semester? (no). Okay, how about the J-term in between the fall and spring semesters? (maybe…). He started pulling out pamphlets and I absentmindedly leafed through them.
At the time, I had a steady job at a local boutique and a long-term boyfriend. I thought all of that was way too important to leave, even for just a few months. But, as the advisor continued to sell me on my options (do these people get a commission on sign-ups or something?) I slowly started to warm up to the idea. He asked me again, “Milan or Paris?” Without really thinking about it I said Paris — I’d seen movies, read books, heard about the French capital. I knew what it looked like at least, as compared to knowing nothing about Milan — a few taps on his keyboard as he took a closer look at my transcript and he told me that if I wanted to graduate on time, a full semester was my best bet. “What do you think?”
Again, without really thinking about it I said, “Okay. How do I sign up?”
I didn’t even have a passport at the time and thoughts of my job and boyfriend fluttered through my mind; to be honest, even to this day I don’t know what made me say yes. Unlike some expats, I never had a lifelong dream of living in Paris, and yet, something urged me to do that semester abroad back in 2012.
I ended up having the best six months of my life, completely fell in love with the city, French culture, the food… I’m sure half of my readership knows exactly what I mean. A group of four of us even ended up staying for an extra month down in Cannes because none of us were ready to leave. Alas, I did have to go back to the US to finish my undergrad, and that I did. Dreams of living in France full-time slowly but surely disappeared as I slipped right back into my former life. I graduated, got promoted at the boutique, and moved into a new apartment with my best friend. Life was “good,” though I couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right.
In the winter of 2013 I was still working at the boutique and was, to be frank, miserable. So what do miserable people do when they’re bored at work? They scroll through Facebook, naturally. A message popped up — it was from a girl whom I studied abroad with who had never left after our semester. She decided to stay to be an au pair with a Franco-American family because she wasn’t ready to go back to the US.
We were just chatting, catching up, when my curiosity got the best of me. “How were you able to stay?” I asked. Was it difficult? I can’t stop thinking about Paris myself…
She filled me a bit and then told me that in fact, she planned on leaving her au pair position in May of next year. She loved the family (and had been with them since June 2012. It was November 2013 at this point) and was helping them find her replacement. She ultimately wanted it to go to someone she knew — she really cared about the kids — was I interested? I hesitated. Maybe. I told her I’d think about it.
Life got busy with the upcoming holiday season and I soon forgot about the conversation. Fast-forward to March 2014 and my friend messaged me again. Did I have time to think about coming back to France as an au pair? The family still hadn’t found a replacement. Like most young women my age, I had plenty of babysitting experience and I even nannied for a few summers when I was a student.
Just like that fateful moment in the study abroad office a year and a half earlier, without really thinking about it, I said, “Okay. What’s next?”
While I’m the first to admit that I stayed in my English-speaking-au-pair bubble for longer than I maybe should have, living and working in France was much different than studying abroad. I had to navigate French culture much more often (I was living with a French person and French children, after all), and learning how to adapt was difficult at times.
I was often homesick after the first six months and the initial excitement wore off — I also struggled to find a core group of friends. But, I did adapt, grow, learn, and eventually, thrive. My years as an au pair were some of my favorite that I spent in Paris and when I did find my people I felt like I truly belonged.
The caveat(s)? I still couldn’t speak French, my au pair contract was running out, I knew I didn’t want to work in fashion anymore, and I also knew I wasn’t ready to go back to my life in Rhode Island.
I had to figure out a way to stay.
Well, I did figure it out, but that story will have to wait until Part 2.

Caroline Giddis walks us through French fashion at the height of “La Parisienne.”
By Caroline Giddis, Curatorial Research Associate, High Museum of Art
Paris, the City of Light, was one of the first cities in Europe to install gas streetlamps to illuminate the ever-expanding streets and sidewalks. This new urban development initiative, which began in the 1860s, shed light on new city blocks of ornate Haussmann architecture and allowed city-goers to remain in the streets longer after sunset. What these gas lamps also achieved was extending the lifespan and visibility of a nineteenth-century Parisian woman’s outfit.
While Paris is the pinnacle of luxury fashion and accessories today, this tradition of exceptional craftmanship dates to the reign of Louis XIV, the “Sun King” (1638–1715), and his finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619–1683), who set a precedent for manufacturing and style that would continue through the centuries. Nineteenth-century Parisian fashion was no exception. In the exhibition In the City of Light: Paris, 1850–1920, several works depict women and their attire, whether they are strolling the streets, attending a performance, or serving as the model for a portrait. Using a selection of these works from the exhibition, which range from 1860 to 1913, we can explore the world of nineteenth-century fashion to expand upon the evolutions of the stereotype of La Parisienne, clothing manufacturing and shopping habits, and the center of fashion influence: the stage.
La Parisienne — A Cultural Icon
In the popular early twentieth-century magazine of fashion plates, Le Journal des Dames et des Modes (1911–1914), French poet and playwright Pierre Veber (1869–1942) contributed the guidelines for achieving elegance, writing, “Elegance resides in the perfect harmony of thoughts, words, acts, gestures, attitudes, and costume. It is through costume that elegance expresses itself most quickly.” [1] In Veber’s opinion, the fastest and surest way to project oneself as an elegant person was by dressing the part. The literary figure and “type” that embodied these pillars of elegance in French society was La Parisienne, in which Jean-Désiré Ringel d’Illzach found inspiration enough to create his Petite Parisienne sculpture in 1883.
This figure is dressed in quintessential early 1880s style: a slender silhouetted skirt; a jacket with a form-fitting bodice over a cuirasse corset and high collar, slim, three-quarter-length sleeves; and ruffles, lace, and frills from head to toe. [2] From the side, her large ruffled bustle and train, which she holds in her left hand, are noticeable. No costume was complete without a headpiece, and here La Parisienne is shown with a bonnet trimmed with ribbon and flowers and tied neatly under her chin.
This ideal woman embodied the highest tiers of elegance, wealth, and personal accomplishment of the age. Dressed in haute couture from Parisian couturiers such as Charles Frederick Worth and Paul Poiret, La Parisienne was a walking advertisement for the consumer economy of fashion and accessories. Her fellow Parisians could alternatively visually consume her impeccable fashion at the theater, opera, soiree, or on the newly paved boulevards. La Parisienne was a symbol of both national superiority and ideal femininity. [3] d’Illzach’s Petite Parisienne is composed and elegant — the sculptural rendition of a fashion plate.
Paul César Helleu’s Young Woman Looking in a Mirror (ca. 1895) is another example of the impeccable style of La Parisienne and her careful attention to her appearance. Styling a mid-1890s costume, she wears a high-necked dress or shirtwaist under a layered cape. Capes were highly fashionable during this period because they sat nicely over the ever-growing puff or gigot sleeve. She wears a straw hat trimmed with ribbons and flowers, and her hair is only half-pinned up, leaving a long braid trailing down her back, which was uncommon at this time but emerged as a stronger trend toward the 1900s. [4] Because Helleu’s sketch captures this woman’s private toilette, she may be intending to pin the braid up, but it’s unlikely as she already has on her hat and cape. Helleu depicts her right before the most important moment in fashion, when La Parisienne steps out into the streets of the city.
Street Style at the Turn of the Century
Nothing projects the sophistication, superiority, and luxury of a Parisienne quite like the subject of Jacques-Henri Lartigue’s photograph taken on the affluent Avenue du Bois de Boulogne in 1911. Donned in a wide-brimmed hat, fur coat and stole, ornately trimmed dress, and boots, accompanied by her two pure-bred dogs, she emanates elegance. The streets of Paris, then as today, serve as their runway.
Achieving this look did not come quickly, easily, or cheaply. Couture, and later haute couture, was the ultimate status symbol [5]. Wearing a custom-made garment by Worth, Poiret, or Jacques Doucet demonstrated the unique taste of the woman wearing it and the craftsmanship of the maker, but it also often flaunted the wealth of her husband or lover who could afford to dress her in such a manner. Explaining the power of couture, Valerie Steele writes in Paris Fashion: A Cultural History (2017), “Fashion served both to maintain hierarchy and to weaken it — as anonymous individuals were increasingly judged on the basis of their appearance.” [6]
As the Third Empire emerged in the 1870s, so did confection, or ready-made fashion, which first arrived in small luxury shops and later became the cornerstone of department stores. [7] By manufacturing clothing at affordable prices, fashion found democratization. Dressing in the latest modes no longer belonged solely to the wealthy. The woman featured on Lefèvre’s poster advertisement (1897) sports a common tailor-made ensemble of the late 1890s with a skirt, a blouse over a straight-front corset, and a gigot-sleeved jacket. [8]
The production of fashion affected the consumption of it. Browsing multiple options of ready-made items made shopping a more popular leisure activity, a scene that appealed to artists who captured modern life. In an illustration for the magazine Gil Blas Illustré (1900), Théophile-Alexandre Steinlen shows a Parisienne deciding between two feather-plumed hats at the milliner’s shop while a display of various trimmed caps sits in the background. This scene could also be taking place at a millinery stall in a department store.
Department stores such as Le Bon Marché and La Belle Jardinière revolutionized shopping by introducing a one-stop shop the size of a city block for clothing and accessories. Providing a visual feast of window displays, department stores appealed to passersby and reduced the number of visits a woman had to make while running errands. [9] While window displays, accessibility to fashion, and haute couture strutted through the streets created a web of influence on trends in Paris, one figure held more influence than all others — the actress.
Early Fashion Influencers
Nineteenth-century writer Octave Uzanne (1851–1931) reflected, “An ancient fashion is always a curiosity. A fashion slightly out of date is an absurdity; the reigning fashion alone, in which life stirs, commands us by its grace and charm, and stands beyond discussion.” [10] No fashionable Parisian woman wanted to be caught in a slightly out-of-date outfit, but the hunger for the latest looks reached a fever pitch during the reign of stage actresses such as Madame Réjane (Gabrielle Charlotte Réju, 1856–1920) and Sarah Bernhardt (Henriette-Rosine Bernard, 1844–1923). [11] Because actresses purchased their costumes for certain roles, they wanted the very best to wear both on and off stage, visiting only the most excellent couturiers for their dresses and suits. Madame Réjane, sketched by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec around 1899, favored the couturier Doucet, while Sarah Bernhardt often preferred Worth but refused him exclusivity. Once one of these iconic women wore a Doucet or Worth design during a performance, department stores began copying and producing ready-to-wear versions within days. [12]
This celebrity-imitation method of fashion trendsetting is no different from modern day. When popular stars like Hailey Bieber or Taylor Swift wear a couture designer dress that garners attention, fast-fashion stores manufacture an affordable copy available by the next week, if not sooner. The desire to look just like the most beautiful, talented, and admired figures remains the same.
The Fashion Capital Reigns
For many women of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the figure to emulate remained La Parisienne. The classic, sophisticated, never-over-done vision of elegance, the Parisian woman remains a mythologized icon to aspire to. With 1.3 billion views on TikTok videos tagged with #parisianstyle and #parisianaesthetic, fashionistas achieve the look of a composed, sophisticated urbanite of the French capital. The seventeenth-century origins of French style continue to peek through, however, especially during Paris Fashion Week as fashion houses and designers — the modern couturiers — debut their latest collections in the city’s most historically decadent sites. Many of those same locations served as the first runways for Les Parisiennes promenading in the nineteenth century, underscoring that fashion itself may evolve, while the flow of inspiration between the city and its clothiers remains as powerful as ever.

I survived the Siege of Paris and all I got was this token.,https://alysasalzberg.medium.com/i-survived-the-siege-of-paris-and-all-i-got-was-this-token-9c470ef2383b,"Sign up

Okay, let me start by saying that the title of this post is sort of a joke. I am going to talk about a commemorative souvenir token that people who lived through the 1870–1871 Siege of Paris could buy, but the “all I got” part isn’t at all how most of them would have thought of it.
As France continued to lose the Franco-Prussian War and the month of September, 1870, progressed, Parisians (and visitors to Paris) realized that the Prussian army would soon surround the city. In a short time, Paris would be cut off from the rest of the world and besieged. And so, many residents and visitors left the city as quickly as they could. An understandable decision, of course, and one that many of them were probably grateful for, since those who stayed in Paris experienced hunger, extreme cold, disgusting bread and other food choices, and even a month of heavy bombardment by the Prussians for those who lived on the Left (South) bank of the Seine.
That said, it wasn’t always easy for those who fled the city, either. In addition to sometimes being separated from family members and friends, they also often hadn’t packed what was really necessary. For instance, a letter in Paris’s Musée de la Poste (Postal Museum) that was delivered by pigeon post includes a complaint about not having brought warm enough clothes. This was probably because most Parisians thought the Siege, which started on September 19, 1870, would only last a month or two, if that. And then there was the fact that no one could have predicted that the winter of 1870–1871 would be one of the coldest in recorded history.
Still, the Parisians and foreigners who stayed behind in the city had a great deal of pride that they saw the Siege through, especially when they compared themselves to those Parisians in the upper class or government who had evacuated.
The Siege of Paris had its humorous side. Satirical cartoons were a huge thing during that time, not to mention funny songs. But there was also an overwhelming, often excessive sense of patriotism. Read even a few accounts of the Siege and you’ll easily find a number of examples. One of the most interesting ones I’ve come across recently was recorded by Francisque de Biotière in his memoir Paris dans les caves, épisode du siège 1870–71 (Paris in the Basements, an Episode of the 1870–1871 Siege). He writes about how mothers would teach their babies to blow a kiss when someone said “Pour les Français ! ” (“For the French!”) and to make a fist when someone said Pour les Prussiens ! (“For the Prussians!”).
This was actually one of the more light-hearted manifestations of patriotism during the Siege. You can see the other extreme in things like the arrest of General Ambert, whose “crime” was yelling “Vive la France!” during a battle, instead of “Vive la République!” What was probably just a slip in the midst of a life-threatening situation was perceived by many Parisians as a sign of dissension towards the the newly created Third Republic, which had been proclaimed on September 4.
Even those Parisians who didn’t become fervently patriotic often felt a sense of pride for having endured the Siege. While I don’t understand the hysterical patriotism, I do understand that latter feeling. And after all, we still make and buy souvenirs today that commemorate things like surviving a hurricane and its aftermath or, on a lighter note, getting through a particularly difficult sport-related challenge or hike…or pub crawl.
The 1871 answer to this was a commemorative coin, called a jeton de présence (token of presence). I was surprised and delighted to discover that there are at least two contemporary descriptions of the tokens in newspapers — one in Le Monde Illustré, and another from the Moniteur du Puy de Dôme, a newspaper from a region very far from Paris.
The French Ministère des Armées’ Chemins de Mémoire blog includes a direct quote from the Moniteur du Puy de Dôme (my English translation follows):
On a frappé à Paris une médaille commémorative du siège, uniquement destinée aux personnes qui n’ont pas quitté la capitale au moment du danger. Elle est en bronze, sur l’une des faces se trouve un groupe symbolique représentant Paris repoussant l’étranger, sur l’autre on lit : République française, jeton de présence. Un espace libre permet à chaque citoyen d’y faire inscrire son nom.”
Frappé par la Monnaie de Paris en argent et en cuivre, ce jeton pouvait être acquis par les civils ou militaires qui avaient été présents lors du siège.
(In Paris, a commemorative medal of the Siege has been struck, solely intended for those people who didn’t leave the capital during this dangerous time. The medal is made of bronze, on one of is faces is a symbolic group of figures representing Paris fending off the foreign threat, on the other [face] one can read: French Republic, token of presence. There is a blank space [below this] where each citizen [who’s purchased a token] can have his or her name engraved.
Struck by the Paris [National] Mint in silver and in copper, this token can be acquired by civilians or military personnel who were present during the Siege.)
Le Monde Illustré’s mention of the token is sort of like a companion piece to this. It’s an advertisement, and shows, among other things, that the token was available in other materials as well: white metal (I’m assuming this would be a cheap alloy that looked like silver) and imitation gold, in addition to silver and bronze. There’s no mention here of a copper option, so maybe the two reddish-gold metals were used interchangeably by the writer of the Moniteur du Puy de Dôme article.
Interestingly, the ad for the jeton was published on January 21, 1871 — a week before the Siege ended. Although most Parisians knew the end of the Siege was inevitable at that point, it’s interesting that some were already producing commemorative souvenirs. There is a sense of opportunism, but maybe it was also a sort of consolation — “At least we got through it,” or “France may have lost, but we Parisians were tough and held out as long as we could.”
In all of my research on the Siege of Paris and its aftermath, I don’t think I’ve ever heard about jetons de présence — or if I have, I guess it didn’t stick with me. They are legit, though; even the Musée Carnavalet, Paris’s delightful history museum, has one in its permanent collection.
And then, one day, I came upon some present-day ads for jetons de présence, on Le Bon Coin. A very popular site in France today, Le Bon Coin is sort of like Facebook Marketplace, where you can find anything — including some really interesting antiques. In fact, it’s where I found my beloved Siege of Paris bread souvenir.
From time to time, I’ll head over there and do a search for “Siège de Paris 1870” and see what comes up. In late February, a few jetons de présence were among the results.
Although they aren’t the most iconic Siege souvenir (at least, not for me — that honor definitely goes to bread souvenirs), the significance of them, that sense of pride that they’re so closely associated with, and that universal idea of wanting to commemorate something we’ve been through, really stuck with me. The more I thought about it, the more I wanted to buy one.* One day, a new jeton de présence ad appeared. Unlike most jetons I’ve seen, this one actually had a name engraved on the back, and, rarer still, it was a woman’s name: Blanche La Jousse.
I loved this connection to a real person, and something about the fact that she was a woman made it even more moving to me. I thought of Claire, one of the main characters of my novel Hearts at Dawn.
But whether or not the name had been that of a man or a woman, the fact that someone had purchased this token and then taken on the additional trouble and expense of having it engraved is a powerful sign to me of how much their experience mattered to them and how much they didn’t want it to be forgotten.
…Although a part of me wonders if it was a misguided gift that had been given to them by someone else. Maybe Blanche La Jousse just wanted to move on from the Siege, and didn’t care about having an engraved coin to commemorate the experience. It’s one of those things we’ll never know.
Jetons de présence are often bought and sold by coin collectors, and in fact, when I reached out to the person who was selling this one**, he told me that he dabbled in coin collecting and had bought it at the Marché aux Puces de Saint-Ouen (a huge antiques and flea market just outside Paris) a decade or so ago. He didn’t know much about the Siege of Paris but had been attracted to the coin for the image on the front.
It’s a compelling one: (Likely) on the wall that then surrounded Paris, an allegorical personification of Paris is defending the city with a spear she’s holding out in one hand. In the other, she holds a flag. She’s surrounded by soldiers. There’s impressive detail in their uniforms; we can see the typical uniform of a member of the Garde National, but also the sailor-like uniform some artilleryman/gunners wore. Many of these men were recruited from the navy. We can also see barrels and other materials that reinforced the National Guards’ posts along the city wall. You can spot many of these in photos like this one. Despite all of these details, though, the face of the Paris figure isn’t sharply defined.
Beneath the group, we have the words “SIÈGE DE PARIS” and the year 1870 in Roman numerals.
The back of the token is far less elaborate, with RÉPUBLIQUE FRANÇAISE written around the top rim, in a curved box with a five-pointed star at the outside of each end. The bottom of the token has the same sort of curved box along the rim, but nothing is written in it. At the top center of the token’s back are the words “JETON DE PRÉSENCE”, followed by a small decorative symbol. The rest of the jeton’s back would have been left intentionally blank, and many jetons de présence you find today remain so, but here we see that as was intended, Blanche La Jousse had her name engraved in the blank space.
I like the back of the jeton best, since it has this unique, human touch.
I didn’t expect to learn more about Blanche La Jousse, but when I received the coin, my husband, who’s an experienced genealogy researcher in his spare time, suddenly had an idea. He called me over to his computer. To my astonishment, he’d found a record of her burial in Paris’s Cimetière du Montparnasse. You can see the two full pages of the ledger here. Blanche La Jousse’s name is the seventh on the list. Here’s a closeup of the line with information about Blanche:
The cemetery’s records gave us some insights into Blanche’s life. She died in 1917 at the age of 75, meaning she was 28 at the time of the Siege. I was amazed that this made her only a few years older than Claire in Hearts at Dawn. Not that this is the most important thing, of course. Still, it was a moving coincidence.
According to the records, Blanche lived in Paris’s 7th arrondissement (7th Ward). We don’t know where she was born, or if she ever lived in other places or even other arrondissements, but this means that at the very least, she was living in Paris during the Siege and was back in the city (which was once again undergoing a war and bombing), at the end of her life in 1917. Maybe she was a lifelong Parisian. If she wasn’t, I hope she was happy about returning here.
It’s doubtful that she’s still in the burial plot listed for her, since Parisian cemeteries tend to remove people’s remains to a charnel house after a certain number of years. But there are exceptions — for instance, family mausoleums or people whose descendants continue to pay for the plot. Whatever the case, we plan to go to the cemetery one of these days and see if we can find her gravesite.
I wish I knew more about Blanche La Jousse than this. I hope she likes being mentioned here, and thought about. I know that, like everyone who stayed in Paris during the Siege, she had a difficult four months. I hope she didn’t suffer too much. I hope she liked her jeton de présence and carried it with pride or kept it in a place of pride. The fact that it wasn’t found at the Marché aux Puces till recently makes me wonder if it was kept by her descendants for a few generations. That’s something I’ll never know, either.
But I hope she thinks it’s funny that her jeton left Paris with a collector and now is back in the city, with a family who wonders about her from time to time and admires her for getting through one of the hardest times in Paris’s history.
~~~
*If you’d like to get a jeton de présence of your own, you can find them for sale on various coin collector websites, as well as on eBay. Most jetons de présence, engraved with a name or not, tend to be sold for around 25–35 euros (about 27 to 28 US dollars).
**Special thanks to the man who sold the jeton to me and answered my questions about where he got it. The photos he took of the jeton de présence are the ones I’ve used in this post, since my phone’s camera just could not get that level of definition. I would have asked if he wanted to be credited by name, but once I told him that my husband and I were going to look for Blanche’s grave, he stopped responding to my messages — I think he thought that was creepy.

A Beauty and the Beast retelling set during the 1870–1871 Siege of Paris, Hearts at Dawn has been selected as a Historical Novel Society Editors’ Choice book. It’s currently available in Kindle and paperback formats and is part of the Kindle Unlimited Library. I hope you’ll give it a read!
If you’re a fan of print books, my friend Rip Coleman, founder of Bohannon Hall Press, recently surprised me by reformatting the print edition of Hearts at Dawn. I can’t thank him enough.
I love the improved font, layout, & chapter headings, and hope you will, too!
Whatever the format, if you do pick up Hearts at Dawn, I’d be forever grateful if you left an honest review on Amazon and any other sites or social media platforms where you post. Reviews help books gain more visibility and credibility. Even a review of a short few lines can be incredibly helpful.
I hope you enjoyed this look at Siege of Paris jetons de présence. I’m still taking a hiatus from regular blogging as I work on my second novel. But I’ll be back as soon as I can with more interesting and strange things to share about life during the Siege of Paris. Feel free to subscribe to this blog or follow me on Goodreads or Amazon to find out when I publish new posts.
Until next time!

What was the view of Paris from Montmartre like in the 1870’s and 1880's?,https://alysasalzberg.medium.com/what-was-the-view-of-paris-from-montmartre-like-in-the-1870s-and-1880s-c5405469caaa,"Sign up

The view of Paris from Montmartre is one of the most breathtaking sights in the city — a sea of slate rooftops and white buildings, scattered with recognizable landmarks, green spaces and other details like islands among its waves.
But how long has it looked like this?
Last weekend, a friend from the US was standing with me at the top of Montmartre. “What was the view like when Van Gogh was here?” he asked. “Was it mostly fields?”
I told him that it wasn’t — Paris has been a fairly large city for centuries and by the 1880’s, when Vincent Van Gogh was living in Montmartre, it was a huge sprawl of buildings, factories, avenues, the Seine, and several large parks. The view of Paris from Montmartre’s heights would at that time have been roughly the same as it is today.
As someone who loves Paris deeply, and has for most of her life, the appearance of the city during my favorite era of its history seems like a given. But I started to wonder what visual proof might exist to show someone that the view from Montmartre has remained roughly the same — not only from the time Vincent Van Gogh was living there, but also from the time of the 1870–1871 Siege of Paris, sixteen years earlier.
My search for answers has taken me on quite the journey these past few days, revisiting beloved images and discovering or re-examining others. Although I’m left with a few lingering questions, I hope that I’ve been able to put together a good collection of visuals that show what the view from various sides of the Butte (hill) Montmartre was like in the 1880’s and in 1870 and 1871.
The view of central Paris from Montmartre in the 1880’s
Let’s start with the 1880’s, since that was the era my friend asked about.
Vincent Van Gogh lived in Montmartre from 1886 to 1887 or 1888, fifteen years after the end of Hearts at Dawn (otherwise, I would have given my favorite artist a cameo in my book!). From what I’ve read in biographies on him, as well as in his published letters, Vincent — as he preferred to be called — found Paris inspiring, but also overstimulating and overwhelming. And it wasn’t always easy sharing the life of his brother and sister-in-law, whose apartment he was staying in.
Still, Vincent painted a number of canvases during his time here, including a few views of Paris. My favorite of these is Vue des toits de Paris (View of Paris Rooftops), painted in March or April, 1887 (a sketch version also exists).
I love that we know exactly where this canvas was painted: from the window of Vincent’s room at his brother’s apartment, on the 3rd floor of 54 rue Lepic. This building still stands today, and whenever I’m in Montmartre, I stop by to look at it and marvel that Vincent once walked here on his way home.
The apartment is privately owned, so unfortunately you can’t go inside, but apparently some scholars have been allowed to. One of them shared in a blog post that the view from Vincent’s old window has, sadly, changed, with new buildings blocking the glimpse of Paris that he immortalized (you can see the current view from the window here).
Another of Vincent’s paintings from this time is usually given the similar title The Roofs of Paris. This time, we get an unobstructed view of central Paris, looking south from the summit of Montmartre.
Even today, this view from the southern side of Montmartre is the most famous one, since it offers an immense vista of the city below. As you can see in this cropped version of the photo at the beginning of this blog post, which I took from the summit of Montmartre last weekend, barring some additions like the occasional skyscraper, the Paris cityscape has remained more or less the same.
Vincent’s painting is of course an artistic interpretation — like many who’ve painted and sketched this breathtaking sight, he seems to emphasize recognizable monuments like Notre-Dame and the Panthéon, when in reality they probably looked at least a little smaller because they were far away. But I think it shows something about that excitement of being able to spot them and recognize them — like seeing friends in a crowd.
I also think the way he seems to have brought the city closer than it would have actually appeared could be a sign of that connection with others that he always sought. Or maybe it’s just his artist’s eye, knowing the precise way to frame the image and emphasize what’s needed.
Here’s another photo I took from the summit of Montmartre, looking slightly westward, cropped as closely as I can get it to Vincent’s painting:
Here’s the same image, with Notre-Dame and the Panthéon, the two most recognizable landmarks in Vincent’s painting circled:
As we can see, in the 1880’s, Paris was already a large, dense city. But this blog focuses on Paris during the Siege, in 1870–1871, so you might be wondering what was the view from Montmartre was like then.
The view of central Paris from Montmartre in 1870–1871
Between the 1870’s and 1880’s, some parts of the world experienced immense growth. For instance, my friend is from Colorado and I could imagine a frontier town changing a lot in those ten years. But in 1870, Paris looked pretty much the same as it did in the mid- to late 1880’s.
Of the things that had changed about the landscape, most would have been hard to spot from this towering vantage point, where so much is lost in that sea of slate roofs and white facades.
But one sure constant is that Paris was already a built-up city, especially in its central areas, and had been for decades.
For instance, in this 1862 caricature by Daumier of the famous pioneering photographer Gaspard Félix Tournachon, who went by Nadar (and who had recently invented aerial photography), we can see that the Parisian landscape below his balloon is packed with buildings, nearly to the horizon.
This is a caricature, of course, not necessarily a realistic depiction, but Paris had to be recognizable for it to work, so we can imagine that this is a fairly accurate impression of how the city looked from a high vantage point.
And in fact, here’s something that always amazes me: Some of Nadar’s aerial photographs, among the earliest in existence, still survive today. Here’s a view he captured of a part of western Paris. As you can see, certain sites are helpfully labeled…including a portion of the Butte Montmartre itself!
The photo is from 1858, four years before Daumier’s caricature. Yet even then, we can see a city that certainly has its green spaces (including the Parc Monceau, which plays an important role in Hearts at Dawn), but it’s very much already an urban landscape. And this isn’t even the heart of the city.
Another way to understand what Paris looked like in the 1870’s and ‘80’s is to look at maps.
Wikimedia Commons has a really cool collection of public domain maps of Paris throughout its history.
One of these maps, entitled “Le Paris de Napoleon III”, gives us an excellent overview of Paris in 1870.
At a glance, we can see one major difference compared to the Paris of today: the wall around the city. Known as the Thiers Wall (l’enceinte de Thiers), it was demolished in the 1920’s and ‘30’s. That said, as far as I can tell, there was no portion of the wall that would have been visible from Montmartre’s southern slope’s view onto the rest of the city, so it wouldn’t have influenced the famous view from the south side of the Butte.
Another difference that may be a bit more difficult to spot at first, especially if your computer is having trouble zooming in on the map, like mine was, is that the city is a bit less built up in certain areas, especially around most of its perimeter. That would probably give an overall impression of more greenery or space at the edges of the landscape than you’d see today.
Unfortunately, while we have drawings, paintings, and aerial views of Paris at this time, I don’t know of any photographs taken specifically from the summit of Montmartre with the intention of showing the view from its southern slope in the 1880’s or during the Siege of Paris. A big reason for this might be that photographic processes at that time couldn’t show distant landscapes in great detail.
But we’re lucky to have at least a few photos that were taken of people and a certain specific object on Montmartre in 1870 and 1871 that happen to give us at least a notion of the view from its slopes and summit.
This is due to the fact that Montmartre played an important role in the Siege and the Paris Commune (March 18-May 28, 1871), in two particularly notable ways:
1. It was the site of several balloon launches. Balloons are an iconic feature of the Siege of Paris, since they were the only (relatively) reliable means for Parisians to send messages to people outside the city walls — in fact, airmail was invented during and because of the Siege of Paris. Two of the balloon launches from Montmartre are especially notable: that of the Neptune, the first balloon launched during the Siege, and that of the Armand Barbès, which took Léon Gambetta out of Paris so that he could conduct government business and rally French troops on the other side of enemy lines.
Here’s a photograph by Nadar himself, showing the Neptune being prepared for flight, in the Place Saint-Pierre, the square at the base of the Butte’s south side.
2. It was the location of a large canon depot (parc d’artillerie). Many of these canons had been funded by donations from Parisians to fight the Prussians. On March 18, 1871 (about a month and a half after the end of the Siege), the French government’s attempt to seize the cannons to hand them over to the Prussians as part of the terms of the treaty that ended the Franco-Prussian War was the event that ignited the Paris Commune, a period of civil war between the French government and the rebel Communards (most of them armed thanks to that same government, which had encouraged them to volunteer for the Garde Nationale during the Siege).
When I was researching Hearts at Dawn, I came across several photos and images of the canons on Montmartre. But I have to admit, while I know that they were stored on the southern side and possibly summit of the Butte, I haven’t been able to find out exactly where the depot was or its extent. Some sources make it seem as though it was on the summit of Montmartre — for instance, this very detailed sketch shows Saint-Pierre de Montmartre, the church that’s been on the butte’s summit for centuries before the construction of the Sacré-Cœur, just beside the cannon.
But others, like this photograph, suggest it also extended down along the slopes.
While researching this blog post, I also learned that the parc d’artillerie was where the cannons were stored, but they were then rolled to areas called batteries — outcroppings with good vantage points — where they were aimed and readied for firing.
I came upon this sketch by Gustave Doré, entitled Batteries sur les buttes Montmartre and dated March 6, 1871. In the sketch, we can see several spots where cannons were placed along the southern side of the hill.
As a point of reference, here’s roughly the same view today:
Back to the first two of these three historical images — what’s most important, for the purpose of this blog post, is what we can see in the background of each. In the background of photo of the parc d’artillerie, a dense mass of buildings makes up even this relatively small portion of the view towards Paris.
The sketch of the parc d’artillerie also suggests that immensity. Today, the dome of Les Invalides and the (then-new) Palais Garnier opera house are still easy to spot and loom fairly large among the rest of the cityscape. But I can’t vouch for the Arc de Triomphe being so noticeable, as I’ve never seen it from Montmartre’s heights. Like nearby monument The Eiffel Tower (which was constructed in 1889 and thus wouldn’t have been visible in the 1870’s or to Vincent when he was in Montmartre), it’s located in the western part of the city, a view that’s largely blocked by trees and buildings on and around Montmartre today.
You can see the Eiffel Tower, though, if you move a bit past the funiculaire. And according to this blog page, you can make out the Arc from the top of the dome of the Sacré-Cœur.
If you follow the link, you’ll see that the Arc de Triomphe is still pretty hard to spot, which makes me wonder if the artist of our sketch was just trying to emphasize it to give a reference point, or whether it might have been more noticeable because that area, while still pretty built up, as we could see in Nadar’s 1858 aerial photo, didn’t have quite as many tall buildings around it as it does today?
Where could you see the view from Montmartre in the 1870’s and 1880’s?
Speaking of vantage points, it would have been impossible to climb to the top of the Sacré-Cœur in 1870 or 1871, since its construction (started in 1875) wasn’t complete until the early 20th century. But the photographer and the draughtsman of our parc d’artillerie images are looking down on the summit, likely from the Tour Solférino, an observation tower that used to sit on the summit of the Butte. The tower’s two upper floors were demolished so as to be less of a potential target for Prussians during the Siege, and in 1874 it was demolished entirely.
You can see the lower portions of the Tour Solférino, as well get a general idea of what Montmartre’s summit looked like where the Sacré-Cœur now sits, in this painting from 1870. In it, Parisians are looking out over the city from what appears to be a makeshift observation platform. Note that while this artist wasn’t as focused on the details of the cityscape below, his use of grays and whites still suggests its size and density.
You can also get a very good overall impression of what the summit of Montmartre looked like in 1871 from Gustave Doré’s sketch of the batteries: The middle of the summit is a vacant space, with the church of Saint-Pierre on the left, and the Tour Solférino and some other structures on the right. In the center, we can see the tops of distant buildings set a bit further back on the heights of the Butte.
(Possibly) A view of western Paris from Montmartre in 1871
On the other hand, I have to confess that this photo of canons on Montmartre
is less easy to understand. The cityscape in the background doesn’t seem to be central Paris, since there are no noticeable landmarks and it looks more spacious and green. In the right corner is what seems to be a tree-lined avenue. There are no factory smokestacks, probably ruling out eastern Paris, as well as the landscape to the north of the city (a little more on those further on). I believe the batterie in this photograph may have been facing western Paris, but I can’t be absolutely sure.
Even though there are some very precise sources, like this webpage giving detailed information like where canons were kept in Paris and how many were at each site, nothing that I can find specifies how many batteries were on the slopes of Montmartre, or just how far around the hill they went.
(Probably) Views of eastern Paris from Montmartre in 1871
Fortunately, we have more precise information for these next images.
These photos date to the Commune (March 18 -May 28, 1871), and seem to show the same barricade on the Butte Montmartre (barricades were common in many streets of Paris during this time), taken at what appear to be slightly different times and angles.
The first is labeled as being on the rue de la Bonne:
while the second is labeled as being located at the intersection of the rue de la Bonne and the rue du Chevalier-de-la-Barre (then known as the rue des Rosiers, not to be confused with the rue des Rosiers in the Marais).
From what I can guess, the barricade could have been located near the intersection, in the present-day square Marcel-Bleustein-Blanchet, which overlooks northeastern Paris. But it’s also possible that it was at the actual intersection of these streets that we see on a map today; since the Sacré-Cœur wasn’t built yet, it might have been possible to get a relatively uninterrupted view of the city beyond, which would be impossible now. But since the Communards seem to be standing near the edge of the hill, my first guess seems more likely.
In both photos, the view of Paris is unfortunately a bit hard to make out in terms of details, but we can see a cityscape stretching out far to the horizon.
On the other hand, the location of the barricade and the fact that we can make out factory smokestacks and numerous green spaces make me even more convinced that this is a view from the eastern, not southern, slope of the Butte, which means this is a view of northeastern, not central, Paris.
This area was less developed and dense than the center, and many factories as well as parks like the fairly recently created Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, were located here. Even today, while eastern Paris is certainly more built up than it was in 1870–1871, many areas are still a bit more open than the center of the city.
The Butte Montmartre in the 1870’s and 1880’s
Montmartre is an iconic Parisian neighborhood today but for Parisians in 1870, it had only recently been incorporated into the City of Light, when the city officially added all or parts of surrounding villages to its borders in 1860. Before that, Montmartre was a village known for its windmills, taverns and guinguettes (beer gardens). After it became a part of Paris, this reputation was still upheld. It also was a pretty inexpensive place to live. With its cheap rents and unconventional attitude, artists began to flock to Montmartre’s slopes. Over the following decades, these included Vincent Van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, Picasso, Modigliani, and many others.
In the 1870’s and ‘80’s, some parts of Montmartre were somewhat built up. For instance, the building Theo Van Gogh (and, for that short time, Vincent) lived in looks like a perfectly normal 19th-century Parisian apartment building. (That said, Montmartre has never totally followed the rules — as its streets were being paved, many often caved in, due to the Butte itself being full of hollow spaces where plaster of Paris had been mined in previous centuries.) But just around the corner, dirt roads, shacks, and wooden dwellings cobbled together by amateur (albeit talented) builders were the norm.
This area roughly between the rue Lepic and the rue Caulaincourt was known as le maquis. The picaresque slum’s origins date to around the 1870’s or ‘80’s. Despite health and sanitation issues, including no running water or building safety standards, le maquis existed to some degree until as late as the 1940’s. You can see some fascinating photos of the maquis through the years here. Keep in mind that most, if not all, of these photos date to later than the Siege and Commune of Paris.
So, if you were looking at Montmartre itself in the 1870’s, you would see a hill dotted with structures like buildings and windmills, but also plenty of undeveloped areas, including a good portion of its summit. By the time Vincent Van Gogh was there, in the mid- to late 1880’s, the maquis would have been more noticeable, and the Sacré-Cœur would be under construction at the summit.
The view north of Montmartre in the 1870’s and ‘80’s
The northern side of Montmartre looks out over a little bit of the city but mostly beyond it, into the northern suburbs. In the 1870’s and ‘80’s, that view would look more like what my friend was expecting. Villages and towns to the north of the city had fields between them, as opposed to the relentless urban sprawl that you see today.
When researching this blog post, I was excited to come upon this 1874 sketch by Eugène Delâtre, which shows the view from the rue du Mont Cenis, a long road that runs down the Butte’s northern slope. In the distance, we can see factories and villages, but also some green spaces.
This is the most radically different view from the Butte Montmartre. Here’s how it looks today — a vast urban sprawl:
A view out of time
Back to our most famous vista: central Paris, seen from the south side of the Butte Montmartre.
Because some areas of Paris were less developed than they are today, the overall landscape in the 1870’s and 1880’s might look slightly less dense, something that most of the visual sources here seem to confirm.
But overall, as we can see from the images I’ve shared here, as well as what we can tell from sources like maps, guidebooks, contemporary novels, correspondance, and travelers’ accounts, Paris in the 1870’s an d’80’s looked, on a whole, very similar to Paris today, especially in the central parts of the city. The same can’t be said for the view from Montmartre’s northern side; today, the scattered albeit big towns have given way to a vast urban sprawl.
Of course, in the 1870’s and ‘80’s, there weren’t skyscrapers, the Centre Pompidou, or the Eiffel Tower (well, not until 1889) — all of which you can see from Montmartre today.
Another thing to consider is that what I’ve described here are the typical views you’d see on a typical day from the top of Montmartre. But I imagine there must have been times when observers in 1870 and 1871 could see some sign of the forts that surrounded the city firing, or some trace of battles in the northern suburbs. During the semaine sanglante (Bloody Week), in late May 1871, when the Communards were burning down landmarks and government buildings around the city, people could surely see clouds of smoke if they were looking down from the Butte. And I imagine its summit would have been an amazing place to observe the aurora borealis that appeared in the sky on October 24, 1870.
But despite all of this, while it certainly wasn’t exactly the same, the general view from Montmartre in 1870–1871 and in the 1880’s wasn’t dramatically different from what we see today. The city was still dense, especially its center, and you can still spot recognizable monuments like the Palais Garnier, Notre-Dame, and the dome of Les Invalides.
This similarity is one of the things that, to me, makes the spectacular view of Paris from Montmartre even more moving. When I look out at Paris from Montmartre, I am seeing the scope of a city of countless stories. I am seeing nearly the entirety of this enormous place that I love. And I am sharing that view with people from the past. Someone in 1870, a year I wrote about and studied and have grown to love, would see almost the same thing as I do now. For a moment, it’s like we’re standing together, suspended in time.

Paris. It is the heart of France. With fashion, gastronomy, arts, and architecture; here lies some of the most unique shopping, sculptures, and structures in the world.
When I first arrived in this beautiful city, I had no idea what to do with myself. There was so much to see, and only having two days booked here, I couldn’t imagine where to begin. Getting some advice, I realized I had to adapt to the local way of life alongside my sightseeing. Here, stopping for un Verre de Vin (glass of wine) is acceptable whenever you need a break. People-watching is a common sport as you relax on one of the many beautiful café terraces, and the people here give off such a relaxed vibe that you have to learn to just go with the flow.
So, I began my discovery of Paris in one of the most famous locations of the city Le Tour d’Eiffel. The Eiffel Tower. I decided I wanted to make the most of this part of my trip, so I went in the afternoon and stayed for the sunset. After entering the plaza, and getting my ticket, I chose to take my time and use the staircase to the top. There is an elevator option, but I thought back to some advice I had been given. Relax, take your time, and go with the flow. So, I took plenty of breaks on my ascent and enjoyed the views over the river Seine. When I finally reached the top, the sun was setting and I had the most majestic view. Standing there, watching the city slowly light up the night, was such a magical experience, I was left speechless. I truly thought there was nothing in the city to top this moment.
Well, was I wrong. After coming back down the tower, I saw a tour boat bobbing along the river Seine, and decided to jump aboard. Now, the view from the top of the Eiffel Tower was impressive and a unique way to see the city. But seeing the Tower herself, up close, and bright as a shining star at the end of the river, there are no words to describe this perfect scene.
I awoke the next morning eager to continue exploring. I walked from the Notre Dame, all the way up to the arc de Triomphe, visiting sights along the way. The metro runs all along this path, but again, meandering through the city seemed to be the best way to experience all Paris had to offer. On the way, I saw the Sainte Chapelle, Palais Royal, the Louvre, Orangerie, and the Place de la Concorde. My second day was filled with so much scenery, sightseeing, and shopping, I was exhausted. Finishing the evening watching a show at the Moulin Rouge before heading home to pack was such an entertainingly perfect way to finish my day, I knew I would jump at the chance to come back to this beautiful city.

How can Paris be the worst at anything? It is so beautiful. It is so historic. It has everything! All of that is true, but it is the worst to drive around. I drove over 6,700 miles across Europe, so I feel I have some experience in the matter.
Driving on the “other side” in the UK took some getting used to, but after a few days, it wasn’t so bad. Prague was a challenge because of all the trams that use the same roads as cars and all the cobblestone streets. Florence was tough because of the narrow one-way alleys. But Paris is on another level.
Sometimes there are dividing lines in the road, sometimes not. Sometimes other drivers abide by those lines, sometimes not. There are all sorts of twists and turns and one-way streets. There are underground tunnels with limited signage. There are cyclists and mopeds and motorcycles (and pedestrians!) weaving through traffic. Then, of course, there are crazy, multi-lane roundabouts like around the Arc de Triumphe.
I don’t think I would have been prepared to drive in Paris if it was our first stop. It was only because I had practice in other European cities (Rome, Madrid, Berlin, etc.) that I was able to make it through unscathed.

When I travel my main mission is to visit places in Paris that are not tourist traps. I want to experience a city like a local vs going to places frequented by and designed for tourists — one, because the quality may not be the same and two, you are most likely going to pay more for subpar quality. I, of course, will see any of the major attractions that are on my list to see, but as far as my dining and exploring go, would rather go to gastronomic musts and places off the beaten path, or at least the touristic beaten path. Also, coming from NYC I’m used to a certain level of service, as well as a certain type of charm. Living here for almost three years, I’ve discovered many gems. If you want to discover those gems, this guide is for you.
Image Source: PInterest
If you are visiting Paris, I suggest you stay central, or in the center circle of the arrondissement map above (basically arrondissements 1–9). Most likely you will want to hit some of the tourist attractions, and, if so, you want to be centrally located. I may be biased here, but I think the best place to stay is Saint Germain on the left bank. It’s just more picturesque and not as congested as the right bank, which is definitely more touristy. If you want to feel like a true Parisian and can secure a hotel or airbnb in the 6th or the 7th arrondissement, that is your best bet. If you prefer the hustle and bustle of Paris, I would do the 1st or the 8th for a more upscale feel or the 3rd or 4th for a more artsy vibe.
Pro-Tip: Renting an apartment in Paris is the best way to get the whole vibe of the city and is pretty cost effective compared to NYC. Also, the space will be bigger. Most Parisian hotel rooms are tiny, so if you don’t require all the creature comforts of a hotel, an apartment is truly the way to go!
Super Pro-Tip: For more affordable lodging and a less congested atmosphere, you can also stay along the borders of the hot neighborhoods, i.e. the 15th in the part bordering the 7th, or the 17th in the part bordering the 8th or the 11th in the part bordering the 3rd and the 4th.
So, you are in Paris, one of the culinary capitals of the world. One cardinal rule to remember, you seriously cannot get any bad food here. It is nearly impossible unless you go to somewhere on my avoiding list . And the lovely thing about Paris is you can eat anywhere based on your budget type and get a pretty solid meal. Here are my top three by category.
Traditional Paris Brasserie popular with the media types located in Saint Germain
What to get: Duck Confit, Baba au Rhum, Bottle of Chateauneuf du Pape
The brasserie where Keanu Reeves and Diane Keaton eat in one of my movie faves, “Something’s Gotta Give”
What to get: The hot foie gras, beef bernaise, bottle of the Gevry Chambertin
Where all the old artists like Hemingway, Cézanne and Wilde used to frequent. There are many seating options including an outside or indoor garden, main brasserie and piano bar
What to get: A gin or vodka martini to start, the foie gras, the lamb, crepes suzette flambé, any bottle of red
One of the best tasting menus I’ve had in my life and the priciest, but totally worth it. You can either do a land/sea tasting menu or a veggie tasting menu. Both are equally delectable. Alain Passard is a genius and usually visits each table during the dinner seatings. You can eat downstairs in the cave, which is more intimate (I did find out that this is where they usually seat the tourists, but it’s better IMHO). You can also request to sit upstairs if you want to be seated with the locals.
Amazing Japanese French Fusion Tasting Menu and one of the better tasting menus I have had in Paris. Space is small and minimalist, but food is amazing. There are 3 tiers-discovery standard and luxe. We did the luxe bc I really wanted the truffles but it was honestly too much food, for me at least!
One of the trendier tasting menus here in Paris so make sure to make your resis months out in advance. If you can’t snag a ressie for your stay, Frenchie Bar à vin is across the street from the main restaurant. They don’t take reservations, so make sure to show up a few minutes or half an hour before they open to snag a table. They serve AMAZING wine and tapas style dishes for dinner. If you happen to be just wandering in that neighborhood, Frenchie to go (another part of their family) is great for lunch and sandwiches to go.
Pro-Tip: Have the sommelier choose your wine when you do a tasting menu as they do know best. And, always do the wine pairing if that option is available.
Located down a side street where the 6th meets the 7th, this brasserie is charming and serves up some of the best southwestern French food you will eat in your life. All ingredients are locally sourced and the cheese and wine come from local shops from a few blocks away.
What to get: Foie gras (toast the bread with your private toaster), the duck confit or cassoulet and the cheese plate. Wash it down with some pinot noir or another red of your choosing.
Way down the beaten path in the heart of the 15th, this little restaurant is not one to miss. With a prix fixe menu that changes almost daily, you really are in for a treat. You get to choose a starter, main course and dessert for the small price of 39€ that is a steal since the food is Michelin Grade!
What to get: Menu changes daily, but get the foie gras for your starter if they have it as it is homemade. They also have bottles of the moment, which are usually treasures.
This restaurant is where French people go to dine and treat themselves. Comprised of a slew of great young talented chefs it is hard to go wrong. You can opt for their normal prix fixe set at 39€, or go all out with their 5 course tasting menu for 59€, both a steal for gastronomical dining!
What to get: Menu changes so if you do the normal prix fixe menu where you have a choice just ask for their reccommendations.
If you are hankering for a flavor of the Mediterranean, head over to Balagan. Vibe is trendy and fun and the cuisine is light yet filling.
What to get: Anything with zatar and the snickers dessert. Their international wine selection is a top on my list!
Craving Italian? For a nice cozy feel, head over to Cherche Midi on the street of the same name. Spot is a cute little neighborhood spot where mostly locals go. The food is pretty amazing and you won’t be sorry.
What to get: The lobster ravioli if they have it or any of their pasta/seafood dishes.
Japanese Fusion hot spot in the heart of Saint Germain. They don’t take reservations, so make sure to go either at the beginning of dinner service or towards the end of primetime dinner. If you are here in August, you will have no issue as most of the Parisians are on holiday.
What to get: The cocktails and a few small dishes to share.
So in Paris, you have two options — you drink wine like the french do (and seriously it’s a crime not to) or you drink cocktails. I like doing both. You can find and drink good wine anywhere, seriously, ANYWHERE — a cafe, a brasserie, even McDonalds, so I hear. But if you want to go to a true wine bar or have a real cocktail, read on.
For those of you who are truly french beginners — this is basically a bar for natural wines. Even though I am not a big bio wine fan, I don’t discriminate as they have pretty good wines here, as well as good vintages. They also have a location in NYC
This is a great lively joint in the 9th arrondissement. Love this place because you can either sit in a main bar, but if you prefer a more intimate setting you can book one of the underground caves and enjoy your wine and nibbles in there.
This is more of a brasserie, than a wine bar, BUT they make my list because they have a cellar of 250+ wines. The best is you can even buy a few bottles to take home.
Pro-Tip: If you are not looking for a full out wine experience you are best served going to a brasserie for apero hour, where the french enjoy a few nibbles (charcuterie and cheese plates, or as they call it “planche mixte”) with their apertif of choice.
Love, love , love the Ritz because it has as many bar options a girl can dream of! If you are going for a speakeasy vibe, you must try Hemingway Bar. Regardless of what you are looking for, you must try Hemingway Bar — their bartender is a legend in his field and the cocktails made there cannot be found anywhere else, including the other bars at the Ritz Paris. They also have two outdoor bars, which are lovely on a nice day or evening or a tea room where you can enjoy a proper tea and champagne.
If you are looking for somewhere off the beaten path and a night of surprises, head over to the Marais to this gem. Cocktails are curated in a special artist’s book that would make a nice addition to your coffee table collection. The vibe is fun and lively.
Wanting to hang in the left bank? Then head here for fantastic cocktails, a great vibe and amazing beats. They also make one of best sazeracs I have ever had.
Pro-Tip: If you really cannot live without a true cocktail, make sure NEVER, EVER, under any circumstances order a cocktail at a brasserie unless you want to be majorly disappointed. Always order your cocktail at a hotel bar, a cocktail club or one of the brasseries on this approved list.
If you are coming during the first of the month and the Louvre is on your list, entry is free the evening of the first Saturday of the month. Saying that, you can still purchase tickets for the VIP section so you don’t have to wait on the super long line. I personally find the Louvre overwhelming and find a guided tour better able to manage my visit — you can still wander around on your own after the guided tour if you wish. This two hour one is my favorite, and as an extra bonus you get to skip the line!
If you really have no interest in going to the top of the tower, and you just want to see it, head over to the steps of Trocadero, which is the best spot to see her majesty. If you do go in, enjoy a glass of champagne at the top or just book reservations at one of the restaurants to avoid the line completely.
Best time to go here is when it is a sunny day with no bad weather or the balcony/tower areas will be closed off. It’s also better and safer to wander the winding and steep streets of montmarte when it’s not raining or snowing.
You can actually climb to the top of the Arc if you just don’t want to be just another one of those tourists trying to get the perfect shot from the Champs de Elysée. I will warn you that this climb is not for the weak of heart — there are no elevators, the staircases are beyond narrow and the air quality leaves much to be desired.
Pro-Tip: If you happen to be touring Paris with a young one in a stroller, you are in luck. You can get to the front of any museum or tourist attraction line. I have often thought about buying a stroller and putting a baby doll in it just for this perk.
Totally innovative for Paris, this is definitely a must see. Imagine seeing works of art projected in a loft like space with music playing in the background. Book tickets way in advance especially if you are looking for Saturday/Sunday tickets, as this is when the French go with their families.
Pro-Tip: Book Friday evening tickets as they have a bar open during these hours
If you happen to be in Paris during Opera and ballet season, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing tickets to a performance.
Pro-Tip: For a more elegant feel and a true Opera experience, make sure to book at Palais Garnier. If you want more of a casual vibe, head over to Opera Bastille.
Taking a daytrip out of Paris is an easy thing to do whether you decide to go by train, car or uber. If you want to go north, take a train and check out the beaches of Normandy. If you want palaces and to see how the royals lived, head over to Versailles. Want to explore your artistic side? Head over to Giverny and get a little taste of Monet. Looking to get your drink on? The Champagne region is your best bet. The possibilities are endless.
Pro-Tip: If you are going somewhere not too far, totally worth it to check uber pricing. Sometimes it makes more sense than taking the train and is less stressful.
Versailles Pro-Tips: If you do Versailles, highly recommend doing a horseback excursion through the gardens before actually touring the Trianon and the Palace. It truly is an unforgettable experience. If you choose only to do the Palace, I would do the guided tour route like the Louvre, as it is massive!
Being one of the fashion capitols of the world, Paris is definitely somewhere to spend those dollars especially since you get your VAT back, which depending on the purchase, can add up to a lot. You can read more about shopping here.
One of my favorite things about Paris is shopping the Farmer’s Markets. The produce and quality of food here in France is superior to the US mostly anywhere, but there is something special about the farmer’s markets. It is more fresh because they make that morning drive with the produce for one and it feels great to support the local markets and smaller businesses.
Marche de Avenue Saxe (Thurs & Sat)
Bio Market Avenue Raspail (Sunday)
A trip to Paris is not complete without visiting a fromagerie. Even if you are staying at a hotel, you must visit a local fromagerie and do a sampling of cheeses. Love the cheese here vs. US because it is unpasteurized and the variety and the special types they make here are simply second to none.
Quatrehomme
Marie-Anne Cantin
Pro-Tip: You can also ask them to vacuum pack your faves for transport to the US. FYI-this is illegal and I’ve never done it, but if you want to try your luck with customs as many do, by all means, go for it!
To feel like a true Parisian just sit at a café in the afternoon or morning and just take in the beauty around you. If you are here for creative purposes, it is sometimes a nice treat.
Chai de l’Abbaye
La Varenne
Pro-Tip: At cafes, you can sit anywhere that is available. You do not need to be wait to be seated. If you do, it will tell them right away that you are a tourist! And if you don’t know French, no problem! Here’s a little cheatsheet that will help you get around.
Another great thing to do is just chill in the park. The lovely thing about Paris is that you can pretty much set up shop in any of the green spaces. The other great thing is there are no close rivals to the type of picnic assortments you can create here — foie gras, saucisson, fromage, wine, champagne…Create your own adventure and curate your basket to the nines!
Invalides
Saint Germain de Laye (outside of paris but def worth the uber ride)
Pro-Tip: Bring the wine. If you didn’t know, drinking outside is legal here, bien sûr!
Paris is truly one of the most beautiful cities in the world and true Parisians walk aimlessly everywhere. Sometimes it is nice to get just get lost wandering the side streets in Saint Germain and the Marais. My best discoveries in Paris have been made by accident! Best time to walk is in the morning before the sun gets too strong and in the evening after dinner to burn off all the calories you just consumed!
So, there you have it — your Parisian visit at your fingertips. Obviously, I have a long, long list of favorites, but we’d be here for hours if I published that! For the full list, click here and put “Paris list” in the additional info field. Until next time, happy exploring!

Thoughts, tips and tricks from an American living in Paris for a year.
When we first moved to Paris, I did a few posts about all the stuff we went through to move here. I thought it would be interesting or helpful to people thinking about doing something similar.
Before writing about our experiences again, I wanted to give it some time to sink in and really be able to reflect back on what we’ve been through and what I think about it. Well, as we’re sadly just about to leave, it’s probably about time. Here are some final thoughts on being a French family for the last 11 months or so.
I want to start this off by saying that this has been a truly amazing year.
I’m going to go into some negative stuff (as well as some positive stuff) because those things are interesting to me, but overall I’ve loved our stay in Paris. The neighbors and friends we’ve made have been just amazing. The French people we’ve met have been some of the nicest and most welcoming I’ve ever known. The tech community here has been nothing but kind to me and excited that I’m here. My daughter sings little songs in French to herself when she thinks we’re not listening and it’s adorable. My French has gone from absolutely zero to being able to understand and say a fair amount. I know Paris, one of the most amazing and beautiful cities in the world, pretty well now. It’s been one of the greatest years of my life, for so many reasons. I couldn’t possibly recommend trying it more.
Now, on to the fun stuff.
By far the hardest thing about moving to France has been being an immigrant. You are in a new place and you don’t know anybody nor do you know the language, customs or habits of life. Not only is that difficult on you, since new things can be stressful — you’re rarely comfortable outside your house since nothing is familiar — but the real hard thing is that it can feel like almost nobody really wants you here.
From the perspective of the average person you have to interact with, you’re hard to communicate with, you’re probably a little stressed out and you’re frustrated at stuff. If you’re a cab driver or bank teller or waiter, I’m sure you would prefer to have a customer who speaks your language instead of someone you have to gesture to. As an immigrant, you’re highly aware of this and it’s embarrassing. Don’t get me wrong, most of the people we’ve interacted with in Paris have been exceedingly kind and helpful, but as the person constantly putting people a little more out of their way than normal, you’re aware of it.
The people who are not kind nor helpful, however, is the government of the place you just moved to. I assume this is true everywhere — I can’t imagine that the immigration offices of the United States are shining beacons of comfort and inclusion — but it’s certainly true of France.
Within 3 months of landing in the country, you are required to get a residency stamp to validate your long stay visa. This requires you to send in paperwork, get an appointment and go in for a health check. The main issue is that in Paris it takes about 3 months to get your appointment after sending the paperwork in, which means if you don’t do it immediately upon landing there is likely to be some period of immigration awkwardness if you try to leave the country. The rules and procedures are incredibly confusing and only exist on their website in French. If you call them up, they will only speak to you in French. When you get there, all of the instructions and literature are only available in French. Only one of the 8 people I had to interact with on my appointment day could (or would) speak any English to me. Calling the customer service line to try to make sure I was doing things correctly ended in abject failure. (“Vous parlez anglais?” “No” “Umm, OK... [click]”). Remember that this is the immigration office.
The problem for us was that they messed up the appointments and accidentally sent me two appointments for Scott and none for my wife Jessica. So since I couldn’t clarify the issue due to language barriers, we showed up with just the one paper assuming the appointment was for us both. Although her appointment was in fact scheduled for that day, since we didn’t have the appointment paper for her (because they never sent it), she was sent away. This means she had a period of months where she had no valid visa because we had to reschedule the appointment from scratch using only horribly Google-translated emails to their department. This means she couldn’t leave the country during that time because it was likely she would not be allowed to re-enter.
The appointment itself was also humbling and embarrassing. You have to sit in a series of rooms with nobody explaining anything in English and people get visibly frustrated with you when you don’t do what they’re apparently asking you to in rapid French. There is a chest x-ray you have to do where you are shuffled into a private room, asked to undress from the waist up, sit there without your clothes on for a while, then walk half naked into another room with two people in it to take your x-ray, then back again to re-dress. My wife was not super happy about that part.
Now, very interestingly to me, this is not what happens when you are sponsored on a work visa. I’m on a long stay visitor visa since GitHub didn’t at the time have an office in France. Some American friends we met through my kid’s school had none of this experience because his company handled everything for them. No x-ray, no immigration office shenanigans, no OFII humiliation that you don’t speak the local language perfectly yet. Even though technically I’m probably the perfect immigrant — someone who is paid from a US company and just spends all his money here — I felt like a dirty shitty immigrant who was being barely tolerated, probably only allowed to stay here due to a technicality.
My experience in the grand scheme of things was not that bad. Compared to almost every other immigration experience, we probably had it near the easiest. It was really just uncomfortable and embarrassing. It just subtly made me feel that I was not wanted here during a confusing process. However, I happen to personally have the means to leave at any time — I can’t even imagine what it must be like to have to go through all of this when you have few other options. To be immigrating because you have to immigrate. I’ve always had sympathy for immigrants to the US, but from now on I’ll have a bit more empathy as well. It is not easy, even when it’s relatively easy.
Speaking of the importance of learning French if you want to move to France for a bit, it might be of interest how I’ve gotten along in learning another language at the ripe old age of 35.
I have tried just about every possible language learning method there is over the last year, most of them for months at a time. I had a 100 day streak on DuoLingo at one point, doing about 30–60 minutes a day. I listened to nearly 4 full seasons of Coffee Break French, which is probably hundreds of hours of audio content. I took about a month of in-person courses (3 hours a day, 3 days a week) at Alliance Française, a globally renowned French language learning school. I had about 30 hours of (expensive) in-person private tutoring with a local French tutor. I took about 20 hours of private Skype lessons through tutors found on iTalki. Plus, I lived in Paris — going to restaurants, buying groceries, getting haircuts, reading the Metro newspaper, etc.
Here is what I have learned. If you want to learn a new language, there is exactly one method to do so quickly and efficiently — private Skype tutoring.
In my opinion, DuoLingo (or any of it’s automated brethren such as Rosetta Stone, Babbel, LiveMocha, etc) is almost totally useless in a practical sense, at least by itself. It may help you to read a bit, you may get some vocabulary to sink in, but it’s not a natural way to learn language and most of it goes in one eye and out the other (or something like that). Months of it will not help you to actually hear the words when spoken by a native speaker, and you will certainly have no practical ability to produce the language.
The Coffee Break French podcast is excellent for understanding real-life spoken French, but obviously not helpful for producing understandable spoken French. It also unnecessarily gets a bit into the weeds on grammar points. If you want the biggest bang out of it, just listen to the dialogue episodes over and over again.
In-person classes, even at prestigious (and expensive) schools like Alliance Française, are helpful but slow. You rarely actually speak to the teacher in a way where you’re corrected. Most of your dialog is with fellow students who are probably worse at the target language than you are. Plus it’s incredibly expensive in time and money.
The absolute best and fastest way to learn a language in a way where you can land in a country and both understand and speak it effectively is one on one tutoring with a native speaker. The cheapest and most efficient way to do that is with Skype. With Skype (or online video chat in general), you have no commute time, no awkward in-person formalities, you can continue classes even when you travel, you are constantly speaking and are being personally and helpfully corrected, and there is a chat window so the tutor can type out stuff they’re saying or you can type answers (which is really helpful in French where stuff doesn’t always sound the same as it’s written). You can get professional language teachers for as little as $10/hour in some languages. That means that for $200, you can take an hour lesson 5 times a week, every day of a month. That plus an hour of homework a day will get you really, really far in even one month. Probably farther than 3 months of an expensive group class. Certainly farther than a year of DuoLingo or Rosetta Stone.
I found great teachers on iTalki, but there is also Lingoda and LiveLingua which look promising. They all have free trial classes, which is a great way to get over the weirdness you might feel in doing an online private class like this. Benny, the guy who runs the great Fluent in 3 Months blog, who has learned a number of languages to fluency, came to essentially the same conclusion. He reviews the iTalki website here, which is a great read.
I’m testing out my theory over the next few months. While I’m still doing French lessons and want to continue to improve, I’m cutting way back on them and am going to start over from scratch with Japanese. GitHub has started really expanding into Japan and I would love to be able to speak some Japanese the next time I go there.
So, I’ve signed up for classes on LiveLingua and am planning on taking them for 1 hour a day, 5 days a week for the next 3 months to see how far I get, starting at the end of July. My hypothesis is that I’ll be better at spoken Japanese by November than I am in spoken French now, even after a year of fairly regular study and living in France. It will cost me about $1500 total for those 3 months of study, but if I’m right it will be way cheaper and way less of my time than getting to the same language proficiency through any other method.
Look for my follow-up post in November.
Finally, I thought it would be nice to share some of the random things we’ve learned about living in Paris. About every month or so someone lets me know they’re visiting Paris and asks for advice on where to eat or what to do and I write a slightly different email every time. I figured it would be good to summarize the stuff I liked doing and the places I liked eating at the most so the next time you’re visiting you can take advantage if you want.
We’ve eaten at dozens of restaurants in Paris since we’ve moved here. Everything from a 3-star Michelin place (L’Epicure at Le Bristol) to the great family run restaurant down the street. I’ll give you my 3 favorite places in a bit, but first I’ll give you the resource I used to find all 3 of them. Teach a man to fish and whatnot.
The Paris by Mouth blog has been the most amazing resource for dining and drinking in Paris by far. It lists great places by arrondisment and I don’t think there is a single place I’ve been to off that list that wasn’t really great. It also has great lists of wine bars and haute cuisine places. If in doubt, just check this list to find amazing places close to you.
Sometimes it’s hard to find a place off that list — many are closed on Sundays, most of them require reservations at least a day in advance, which means calling them and trying to speak in French occasionally, some of them can’t take large parties, etc. My fallback on these occasions is the Yelp of Paris, La Fourchette. You can search by group size and times they are open and make reservations online. You can also rank by rating and pretty much everything I’ve booked via this site has been really good as well.
There you have it. Now, just for fun, I’ll share some of my personal favorite places to eat in Paris.
The first is Les Papilles. It’s a wine store and small restaurant near the Luxembourg gardens that is my favorite place to take visiting guests. They have no menu, they just bring you a few courses of great French food and you choose a bottle of wine off the wall.
It’s charming and delicious and fun, I adore this place.
The next is Verjus, in the 1st arrondissement, near the Louvre. It’s more upscale and expensive, but not ridiculous. The food is amazing and it has an adorable wine bar downstairs.
The last is a place called Aux Anysetiers du Roy on the Ile St. Louis (a few blocks from the Notre Dame on the smaller island). The clientele is almost exclusively touristy, but we love it. The cassoulet is my favorite and the bathroom upstairs is amazing. I’m not kidding, you have to go to the bathroom when you go here.
I’ll also throw in Dans les Landes, a tapas place in the 5th. I had a frustrating experience with one really rude waitress there once where she didn’t want to seat me because I didn’t speak French, but everyone else there has been great and the food is great (and pretty different).
Of course, food in France is great, but when you visit Paris you really want to have some great wine, right? Well, fortunately there are some great wine bars here, but unfortunately French wine can be really confusing, especially to Americans.
In America, wines are generally labeled by varietal, the name of the grape. So you would generally know that you like a Chardonnay or a Pinot Noir or a Cabernet Sauvignon. In France you will almost never see the name of a grape on a bottle of wine. Instead everything is labeled by “appellation” or region. Each of these regions has rules about what they can grow and how, so if you know you like a Pinot Noir, you have to know that that grape is normally (and almost exclusively) grown in Burgandy, so you have to look for a Burgundy red wine. Of course, it doesn’t generally say “Burgundy” on the label either, so you have to know that “Mercurey” is a region in Burgundy and look for that.
I knew absolutely nothing about wine when I moved to Paris and in my time here I’ve become somewhat obsessed with it. I’ve taken a series of increasingly serious wine classes resulting in just having completed the WSET Level III advanced certification in Wines and Spirits and contemplating enrolling in the Level IV Diploma classes (more on this adventure in another post).
However, you don’t need to do that to appreciate and enjoy French wine. What I would suggest is to take a basic tasting class though. You’ll learn a ton, you’ll drink good wine and you’ll have fun. If you think Bordeaux is a grape, take a wine class here.
I highly recommend the Tour de France wine tasting at the O Chateau wine bar in the 1st. It’s fun, it’s in English, the wines are great, you learn a lot about French wine and they assume you’re an absolute beginner. It’s also a beautiful spot.
I’ve taken a couple of groups of friends and family here and it’s always been super fun.
As you get better at wine, they also have a huge by the glass selection and serve down to 3cl portions so you can taste a bunch of different wines relatively cheaply.
If you’re into tasting different wines, my other recommendation is Wine Touch. It’s a little place by the Pompidou centre in the 4th that gives you a smart card and a glass and you walk around and self-serve from a bunch of machines filled with French wines, grouped by region. At the end you pay for whatever you poured. It’s a fun way to taste several different wines without being intimidated by a server, if that’s not your thing.
Finally, my favorite place to buy wine is a small place on Ile St. Louis run by a slightly crazy Frenchman who deals only in organic and bio wines at L’Etiquette on 10 Rue Jean du Bellay. Everything I’ve bought there has been really good, but that may just be because I really like bio wines.
I shared a number of tips and tricks useful for living in Paris as an American family in a previous post. These were things we learned a few months in, like getting a French bank account or SIM cards for our phones. Well, in the next 8 months we learned a few more things that might be helpful.
The first is getting health care. If you get sick in Paris it can be difficult and intimidating to go to a doctor. They’re not easy to find, they don’t work long hours and they often don’t speak English well (or at least the other people in their office don’t, making appointments quite difficult). Our expat health care had a directory, but we only ever went once. It wasn’t real bad, but it wasn’t a great experience either, plus it would take a while to get an appointment and it was way across town.
What we ended up using for the majority of our health issues while in Paris was the SOS Doctor service. It’s a 24/7 house call doctor service operating throughout Paris. If you feel sick or need something you can call them at 01 47 07 77 77, the service speaks English and all the doctors speak English, they’ll arrive in an hour or so and it’s something like €40–60 per visit.
Now, for French health care, that’s insanely expensive. France operates off of sort of a universal Medicare system, so all doctors visits are regulated at like €22, I think. For French citizens, most of that is automatically covered by the state as well. However, for most Americans, being totally used to the developed world’s worst possible health care system, paying $50 to see a doctor even with insurance isn’t considered ridiculous — I think typical copays are around $30; if you went to the doctor without insurance it would probably be around $200. So for us, paying €50 for a doctor to come to our home in an hour, any time of the day or night and speak English has been a dream. You could go to the French doctor a 30 minute Metro ride away for free (because expat insurance covers 100% of everything because everything is reasonable here), but when you get the winter gastroenteritis from holding on to the Metro pole like everyone eventually does, you’ll be throwing your €50 at these guys.
Finally, God help you if you need a pharmacy at 1am on any day, there is like 1 of them open in all of Paris. On holidays it’s even worse. My advice is to go through this list the day you arrive, find the 24 hour one closest to you and write down the number and address and make a dry run. If you ever need something in the middle of the night (for your kid or some emergency), call them first to make sure they’re actually open. We had a pretty horrible night of me being really sick and Jess making useless Uber rides to closed pharmacies that said they would be open online. I’m not kidding — the night in question was a holiday Sunday and there were literally probably 3 pharmacies open in the entire city of Paris.
Although the food in Paris is amazing, it is in fact very French. If you’re American you will probably eventually want something else. Living in San Francisco for a long time, this was particularly difficult on us. Mexican food here is very rare and generally pretty bad. Sushi is ubiquitous and almost without exception totally horrible. Imagine mediocre sushi you would get from the local grocery store in nearly every single sushi place in Paris.
For Mexican food, you’ll pretty much only be able to find tacos that are any good. There is Candelaria, which is great not only because they have really good carnitas tacos, but there is a sort of speakeasy in the back that is a hip little bar.
There is also El Nopal, up in the 10th, which has great tacos but no seating, so you have to go there on a nice day. We went there on a cold, rainy day not understanding the situation and it was really sad.
If you want to get some American groceries, you have a couple of options. A lot of stuff will be in the local grocery stores, but some things are pretty hard to find. Salsa, pancake mix, maple syrup, cheddar cheese, popcorn, oatmeal — there are a couple of things that you might want that can be difficult to find.
For these things, Jess and I generally go to a ridiculous store called the Grand Epicerie in the 7th. The Epicerie is insane — it’s like a crazy upscale, even more expensive version of Whole Foods. It has a whole fois gras counter, tons of fresh produce and fish, a huge wine cave downstairs, a really good bakery, an enormous cheese selection and a great little cafe to get a glass of champagne in. It also has an aisle of American foods if you’re looking to get any of that hard to find stuff. The Posted in Paris blog has a few other American groceries in town, though I haven’t been to either.
Speaking of missing American things, after some time you might also be looking to watch American movies or television. A few quick tips for you that took us a bit of time to figure out.
If you want to watch a movie, you’re in luck, because basically every movie that everyone on the planet watches is an American movie. We pretty much have a massive stranglehold over the entire cinema industry. Even though there actually is a French cinema ecosystem, of course made most famous by the blockbuster movie “Taken” (just kidding, though that is a French production company), at least half of the movies playing in France (and almost everywhere else in Europe) are Hollywood movies. The trick to going to the movies in France is to look for the letters “VO” for version originale, or VOstF for Version Originale sous-titrée en Français, meaning that it’s in English and subtitled in French. If you look for that when buying tickets, the movie will be in English. The opposite is VF, meaning it’s dubbed into French.
On the other hand, if you want to watch American television shows, even on services that you paid for in the states and may continue to pay for, such as Netflix or even Apple iTunes, you have a slightly larger issue. This is because everyone is fucking stupid. Everything you try to watch legally has regions and borders and ridiculous rules that somehow apply when you’re living in the US but not when you’re visiting France and vice versa. So, in order to keep watching my Netflix shows I use a program called TunnelBear which routes my internet traffic through a US server. If you’re smart, you’ll just pirate everything so you don’t have to put up with all of this bullshit, but I like buying my content, even though the companies I pay for it make it as difficult as possible to use their shit.
Finally, a few tips on having a kid in Paris. There are actually a ton of really fun things for kids to do in Paris, from great parks and zoos to some really amazing museums. Here are some of my daughter’s favorite things.
In the summer, there is a fun little hidden park/playground right by the Grand Epicerie called Compagnie des Filles de la Charité Saint Vincent de Paul. There are a lot of expats and also French families that go hang out there when it’s sunny. Lots of pickup soccer games and champagne picnics in the sun. It’s a great way to meet other families with kids and for your little one to run around with other kids.
There is also a great playground in the Jardin de Luxumbourg. It costs like €2 to get in, but it’s huge and has a ton of awesome stuff to do.
Right outside of it is a little merry-go round where they give the kids these little sticks and each go-round they can try to skewer a metal ring. I’ve never been so jealous of being too big for a ride.
There is also a cool big pond in the middle of the Jardin de Luxumbourg, right in front of the Senate building, where you can rent little sail boats and push them around with sticks. Some good old fashioned 18th century style children's entertainment.
There is also a pretty great and fairly new zoo at the southeast edge of the city. It has a big park right outside of it that is really great and has a great big playground as well.
As far as museums go, there are a few good kids ones, but they’re mostly in French. If you can’t speak French they’re not quite as fun. Jo likes pretty much everything in the Jardin des Plantes, which includes a small zoo, the Grande Galerie de l’Évolution and the rather ridiculous Galeries d’Anatomie comparée et de Paléontologie, which is basically a museum designed 100 years ago and frozen in time.
If you go there, make sure to head on over to the Cafe De La Grande Mosquée and have a tea. You can just sit down in the courtyard and a guy walks around with sweet tea for like €2 each. If you want, you can take a walk around the inside of the Grande Mosquée as well, it’s really beautiful.
Finally, if you want to go to the Louvre and you have a kid, my advice would be to get a copy of “Discover the Louvre” at the gift shop for them. There’s a bunch of cool little games and things for them to look for, it gives them stuff to do as you walk around.
One of the most difficult things to figure out for us was babysitters. There are a few babysitting sites (in French) if you want to go through a bunch of profiles and hire someone randomly, but Jessica and I weren’t super happy with that. In the end we went the more expensive option of using a referral site called Complete Paris. It was a one time €50 fee and they sent us resumes and we picked someone who ended up being really great. I really wish we had done this earlier, because the €50 wasn’t very much compared to the number of times we’ve used her to watch Jo. Since then, Jess and I have actually been able to go out on dates and whatnot.
If you’re still with me after this entire post, then you’re a champ and you deserve something special. I have two snippets of fun insider Parisian information for you.
First of all, I’ll tell you about the best free view in Paris. There are no lines, it’s free, it’s a beautiful view and you can have a glass of wine while you’re there.
It’s the roof deck of the Galeries Lafayette Haussmann, right behind the Opera building. It’s one of the oldest department stores in the world and has an amazing dome inside. Go check out the dome and then go up all the escalators until you get to the very top of the building. There is a big deck with some cafe vendors and a great view. You can see just about everything in Paris from here.
While you’re there, you should probably also pop over to the Opera building, because it’s beautiful and also rarely has a line.
The second special Parisian nugget of information is the secret entrance to the Lourve. It’s not secret so much as just nobody knows about it. On the street in between the Seine river and the south (Denon) wing of the Lourve there is an entrance that is rarely used called the Porte des Lions.
It’s pretty easy to spot because there are two huge green lion statues flanking both sides of the gate. Just walk halfway through the tunnel there and there is a glass door. It always looks like an employee entrance or something, but you can just walk in and buy a ticket. I’ve been through this entrance probably 5 times now and I’ve never seen anyone in line there, even when there are literally hundreds of people in line at the Pyramid entrance.
It’s also pretty easy to beeline it from there to the Mona Lisa and the Venus di Milo, which are both also in the Denon wing.
That’s it for now. I hope this has been helpful if you’re planning on visiting or living in Paris.
We’re actually moving back to the US here in a few days, so this is my last week being a Parisian. Overall, I think this has been a hell of a fun adventure. I didn’t learn as much French as I thought I would, nor did my daughter, but it doesn’t really matter. We had a grand adventure, we got to travel all over Europe, I learned a lot about remote work and I have a vastly different viewpoint on so many things having lived somewhere very different — all of these things helped us grow and made our lives more interesting.
If you’re interested in moving abroad, especially to Paris, let me know. I think it was worth it and I think the world would be a better place if more people were able to do this sort of thing — live in someone else’s world for a short time.

Paris — a city in France. It’s a place so magical, it sends Japanese tourists into an emotional tailspin, and not the good kind!
I recently saw a headline on the Matador Network, which has never accepted any of my travel writing pitches, that boasted “12 things I wish I knew before visiting Paris.”
When I saw that article, I thought, what a great idea! What better way to tell people you’ve been to Paris (France), while remaining humble and “down-to-earth” (only a real asshole would write an article called “12 Things I Already Knew Before I Went To Paris That Turned Out To Be Accurate,” right?)? (?)
That’s what I love about travel lists on sites like Matador. They’re so helpful! They help you (the reader, in need of information) and me (the writer, who needs to feel useful).
So here’s my take on such a unique concept, complete with not 12, but 13 things you should know before you go to Paris. Take it from me, because I already went to Paris.
As it turns out, “French” is more than a mustard — it’s a form of communication. Try as you might, you won’t get anywhere in this town if you don’t speak the language, as French people are notorious for surrendering upon realizing you speak a foreign tongue.
Before my trip, I read up on something called “cognates,” which are words that look and sound the same in different languages, and even have similar meanings. “Perfect.” I said. “This will help me get around the fact that I don’t speak mustard.”
But every time I went shopping in Paris and asked for a baguette to carry the cheap drawings of the Seine that I’d bought for one euro, people looked at me funny, and then gave me a long, oval-shaped piece of bread. It was the strangest thing! As it turns out, a “bag-ette” is not a small bag, but a type of baked dough. Not bad, but they can take awhile to hollow out.
Don’t light that part.
Throw off the chains of your prude American or British or whatever upbringing and be not afraid to drink wine — yes, white wine! — at a picnic with all of your male friends. Dudes do it all the time. It’s fine! No one thinks you’re gay, bro! And if they do, it’s Europe! I don’t know, maybe you should kiss that guy! I don’t care! Or maybe I do! Maybe I do care! But in a good way!
You thought you had style, or that you knew how to wrap a scarf around your neck, but you were wrong, and you don’t. Sorry, but you’re a peasant, and everyone knows just by looking at you.
Didn’t think I was gonna go there, did ya?
Does it seem like I’m just padding out this list? Yeah? Send me a picture of you hanging out with French President Emmanuel Macron. Until then, this one stays.
He’s not actually buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery. He lives on the moon with Tupac.
I’m dead fucking serious. Don’t order an espresso to sip at the espresso counter, and then when you see an open table, take your little-ass cup over to the table and sit there like it’s no big deal. That’s an extra half euro, or maybe a euro, and it will also cost you 1,000 Euro Cool Points, which can never be recouped.
I don’t want to have to tell you this again because it’s embarrassing when you say it wrong and I’m not going to spend my whole vacation correcting you.
Love is dead. And just because the light falls on the eaves a certain way, and the streets pulse with the sounds of a romantic mustard oozing from the lips of beautiful people, and the rivers ripple beneath your feet as you head to the middle of the bridge to affix a lock with your name and the name of some girl you met on Spring Break to the twisted metal for all eternity or until they are removed by sanitation, doesn’t mean you’re somehow exempt.
But it’s fine. They wash the streets every day, because French people are ridiculous. Just watch your step in the afternoon, or maybe it’s the morning, I don’t remember.
France may hold some deep meaning for you because you like Hemingway or Chanel, but as it turns out, more than 10 million people live in the city and its surrounding suburbs, and they could give a shit about your little fantasies. They have places to go and people to see. So stop trying to figure out how I screwed up when I went to Paris and go eat the liver of a duck that’s been force-fed corn like a good little tourist, okay?
I didn’t need to know anything different before I went there, actually. I fucked up a lot and that’s what travel is: fucking up and making the most of it. If you don’t have a bad meal, pay too much for a shirt, get stranded on the side of the road, offend a local, or fall asleep face down under a bridge at some point on your trip, you’re doing it wrong.
Hope this helps!

For me Paris is the most beautiful city in the world — the City of Lights, of History, Arts, the city of Culture. No other place offers so much to see and to do as the French capital. Just to start, there are 206 museums, 2,185 historic monuments, many opera houses, theaters everywhere, the best restaurants in the world, charming bars and cafes and luxury shopping like nowhere else. Paris deserves time, and many visits. You can’t do it just once, or in few days.
Which is exactly why so many tourists visit the city — all the time, in great numbers, non-stop. My father, who also loved Paris, once said that Parisians are accused of being rude, but that, in fact, “they are just tired of being visited for centuries”. Indeed.
And right now tourists are coming in greater numbers, despite the terrorist attack of November 2015 and Donald Trump’s declaration that “Paris is out of control, so dangerous’, during his presidential campaign. In 2016 alone, 36,5 million tourists came to Greater Paris, and in the first half of 2017 hotels there received no less than 16 million guests, according to the Paris Visitors Bureau. That is a lot of people! What it means is, if you want to go to any of the major attractions — the Eiffel Tower, the Champs Elysees Avenue, the Louvre Museum or the Marais neighborhood, to name a few — you better be prepared to face crowds of people from every corner of the world: all looks, languages and ages are represented in the streets of Paris. To actually enjoy some of those attractions, you may have to fight your way in.
This is all fresh in my mind. I just came back from Paris after 10 days in the Marais, the charming old part of town that is all the rage now. October is not a particularly high time for tourism — not summer vacation (good luck then!), not a holiday, not the (in)famous Fashion Week, no Christmas or religious holiday, either. Yet, all over the city nervous tour guides holding signs up high, to keep their groups together, disputed with the residents the narrow sidewalks. Crowded? You bet!
And there are newcomers to this scene: the Chinese. Until recently not allowed by their communist government to travel abroad, they are sure making up for it — in 2016 alone, 881.000 Chinese visited the city, and the number keeps growing, again according the Paris Visitors Bureau. Stores are full of them, museums, restaurants, cafes, sidewalks. Never alone, but in groups of 12 or 15 people, they love luxury shopping and buy everything they can, taking many pictures, curious and excited, and clearly enjoying themselves a great deal.
Paris is not only great things, of course. On a sad note, this time I also saw refugees from Syria and other Middle East countries, a problem all of Europe is facing these days, one with no clear solution in sight. Some sleep on the streets, some build shelters wherever they can, a clear challenge to the government of newly inaugurated president Emmanuel Macron. Another concern is the pickpockets in the subway, usually young gypsies who also sing and play instruments in the cars. Once on a ride, I heard a Frenchman near me yell at a kid begging for money: “you should be in school at this hour”. Everyone around seemed to agree.
But even with problems Paris is still amazing — and fun and beautiful, and worth every penny I spend to visit it whenever I can. No other place I know — and I’ve been to many — takes my breath away the way this city does, with its beauty and grace, glamour and class. No matter how many times I see it, it always surprises me.
But this last visit convinced me to be careful with my dates, next time. I will for sure avoid school vacation — July and August — when Parisians travel with their kids but parents from the rest of the world bring theirs. I will stay away from Fashion Week, which in 2018 will happen on Feb 27th — March 6th, when designers from all over come to look for “inspiration”, booking all hotels in the city and causing price surges everywhere.
Come to think of it, I may choose to travel in cold January, when the streets are not crowded and the lines smaller at the museums, something I did once and enjoyed immensely. It’s easy to check the city’s calendar in advance: there is a site in English for that: https://en.parisinfo.com/. I don’t work for them, by the way, but find it very useful and easy to navigate.
No matter what time of year I choose to go, my love affair with Paris will never die, though. In one of my favorite movie scenes ever, the iconic last scene of the movie Casablanca, Rick said to Ilsa: “we’ll always have Paris”.
I thank God for it, and I will keep going back, bien sur.

“…Is to know a great deal.” ~ Henry Miller (controversial author)
Paris is a place of lore. After years of listening to people I love and respect talk endlessly about Paris, we had arrived. Albeit, only for a long weekend. It wasn’t enough time.
It’s not only clients or friends. Paris has been revered throughout history as an artist’s haven.
“An artist has no home in Europe except in Paris.” ~ Friedrich Nietzsche
A divine place of historical significance, beauty and culture.
“A walk about Paris will provide lessons in history, beauty, and in the point of Life.” ~ Thomas Jefferson
And of course, surrealism and the années folles or the golden twenties. The birth of pop culture. The modern development of fashion and style. A melting pot of American influence, tremendous economic growth, film, theatre, and athletics.
Many of my favourite writers and artists have lived in Paris at some point in their career.
“Paris was always worth it and you received return for whatever you brought to it.” ~ Ernest Hemingway
For the novice traveller, Paris comes with quite the résumé.
Dare I say it is the the most over-hyped city I’ve ever travelled to. My feelings are more mixed than history’s. Possibly due to over-saturation and cost of living. Which is saying a lot coming from Vancouver (another high cost of living city). Then again, it could be because I don’t have any Parisian friends to show me around.
It’s the 3rd most visited city in the world, but the average dollar amount spent by tourists is double the top two cities (Bangkok/London). $301/day USD compared to $153–173.
It’s extremely expensive, and shockingly packed with tourist destinations.
You can’t walk more than a few hundred meters without tripping over the next museum or historical landmark. Seriously I can throw a rock from the Louvre to Saint Chapelle.
We saw the outside of pretty much everything on day one. Then we were left wishing we had planned some skip the line excursions. Getting ready to leave and Oktoberfest were so busy we forgot to plan things that weren’t accommodation. Even in October, it was crowded with tourists!
Yes, I understand the irony of that statement, being that I’m a tourist. No matter how I may like to pretend I’m not, or try to experience places as locals do. I remain an ignorant tourist.
I can only wonder how @#%@ing crazy Paris is in the summertime.
Paris, has a population of ~2.3 million. The majority of the city is composed of five story walk-ups. Making it the most densely populated metropolis in a developed country and it’s geographically tiny!
Vancouver is tiny, at only 115 km². We build towers exceeding thirty stories and have a population of only 600k. San Francisco, another tiny city, is 121 km² and 800k people. I’m amazed by the density of Paris without the need for many tall buildings.
Paris is a mere 105 km² with triple or quadruple the people. That means it’s chaotic. Very walkable, with an somewhat outdated and packed metro system. At least it covers a great deal of the city and they post hilarious signs in it.
And my personal Fav…
Are misunderstood. I had full on expectations of being forced to stumble through my poor French. While the person I’m attempting to communicate with snickers behind my back about it.
You hear stories. Few of them true.
The service doesn’t suck, it’s just not Americanized. It’s supposed to be felt and not seen. They are not coming to check on you every 5 minutes. They are not coming by to crack jokes and entertain you for tips. They want you to enjoy your meal or coffee or whatever. When you’re done, ask for the cheque s’il vous plaît and you’re off.
I kind of like it. I’m not fond of being waited on.
People are not rude. But you should keep an eye on your stuff and your wallet when travelling on packed transit. As you should in any major city.
People are fashionable. I should have brought a scarf. A concern Jenny and I both have about travelling to Europe, is only obvious in Paris so far. Not that I’m fashionable to begin with. I have for the better part of twelve years worked in shorts, a sweat-wicking shirt and maybe a track suit of sorts.
There is a pervasive feeling in any country about the largest city. Canadians outside of Toronto like to hate on it. The French outside of Paris also seem to hate on Paris. I get the feeling Parisians are in love with their city.
There is an air of smugness. I feel the same way about Vancouver. The French tend to think that Parisians never shut up about Paris when they leave it. Everything is better in Paris! I don’t feel this way about Toronto but I know some who do.
I’m choked I missed the Catacombs. Things were so crazy before we left and at Oktoberfest we forgot to book any tours.
The only non-negotiable thing for me was the Louvre. I’ve had a fascination with Leonardo Da Vinci since I was a kid and seeing the Mona Lisa was a top priority.
It’s true that no matter where you stand in the room, it feels like she’s staring just at you. A special technique Da Vinci used. Of course the world’s most famous painting is so famous due to the mystery surrounding it.
There are many other famous works in the Louvre like Venus De Milo, Winged Victory, The Coronation of Napoleon, Dying Slave and Liberty Leading Leading the People. Michelangelo. Delacroix. Who cares? I’m all about Da Vinci right now. 😜
We crushed a few kilometers of walking every day. I thoroughly enjoyed taking it all in. You could have a great weekend without going into a single tourist venue.
We stayed near the Eiffel tower. Had a bottle of wine on the grass during one of the hourly light shows. Roamed through a beautiful market. Rolled down Champs-Élysées past the Arc de Triomphe and the Louvre.
I know French food is amazing but we cooked in our tiny AirBnB more often than not. Who can resist French cheese and charcuterie?
After a costly Oktoberfest, we’re attempting to be a little more budget conscious here. It seems more likely we’ll be back to Paris than Munich anyway.
I’m just going to say it. If you like red wine, it’s the best in France. End of story. I’m convinced they don’t ship any of the good stuff to Canada.
Oh and don’t forget about the street art and a surprising coincidence. An Alphonse Mucha exhibit was on when we were there! One of the few pieces of art we own is a print of Zodiac. I’m a much bigger Mucha fan leaving Paris.
That’s our world-wind tour of Paris. It isn’t my favourite city yet but I can see the charm and appeal. We’ll be back for the catacombs.
It was the weekend so neither of us worked which was nice, Bordeaux will be different. Back to work...🤘

So you’ve landed in Paris with your family and your cats. What now?
It turns out that when you land in another country halfway around the world where you’ve never lived and don’t speak the language, things can be a little confusing. We were especially ill-prepared, not having been to Paris before for more than a few days at a time and neither of us speaking more than a couple of words of French. When we landed, we had the address of our rental apartment and a few bags and that was about it. We’ve learned a few things since then that may be useful to anyone following in our footsteps.
Here is a survivor’s guide to the first 30 days on the ground in Paris.
If you’re from the United States, it’s likely this is going to be the most confusing thing for you when you land and try to get a life together here. There are two major differences between bank accounts in Europe and in America — the “chip and pin” card and the RIB.
Let’s start with the “chip and pin” card. You know that credit or debit card that you have in your wallet? Well, it’s useless in about 20% of the places you’re going to try to spend money here. In another 30%, while it will technically work, it’s extremely confusing to the people trying to take it. You see, in Europe, they have “smart card” credit and debit cards. They have a little smart chip in them (a little goldish squarish technical looking chip on the left side of the card) and a pin code.
Everywhere you go, instead of swiping your card, you stick the card into a reader and type in your pin. Restaurants never physically take your card away, they bring a reader to your table and you insert your card, type in the pin and take the card back out. I don’t think I’ve had a single French person touch any of my credit cards once since landing here. The way Americans handle credit cards is comically insecure to the entire European continent.
I had a fun issue with this almost immediately after getting here. We landed in Paris on Monday morning. On Thursday evening, just a few days after touching down, I attended a meetup that GitHub was sponsoring by buying pizza, soda and beer. A few hours before starting, the organizer let me know that I would have to personally pay for the food on site. Normally this isn’t how it works, normally they would pay for it and GitHub would reimburse them, but these details weren’t worked out beforehand.
I knew this was potentially going to be a problem, because I’ve been to Europe before and I know about the chip cards and besides that I only had an Amex corporate card which not everyone takes. I figured I would probably have to put this on a personal card at best. Well, it turned out that they delivered €993.14 worth of food and low and behold, they only take chip cards. So I had to embarrassingly find someone there who could float $1300 personally and PayPal them the money. This was also done almost entirely in French. Good times.
This is just the worst situation I’ve encountered. Tons of places simply won’t take non-chip cards. The most frustrating is the Metro system — if you don’t have a chip card or cash, no trains or public transportation for you.
The next major difference between the US and French banking systems is the RIB. “RIB” stands for Relevé d’Identité Bancaire and is one of a few bank account numbers that are needed for bank transfers (basically a wire). For ongoing monthly payments, credit cards seem to be almost never used here. Instead, you give people your RIB sheet (like a weird little bank form that you print from your bank website) and they do bank transfers every month with these numbers.
It’s actually sort of an awesome system because you can look up individual people you’re paying this way and shut them down individually if you want to stop paying. With a credit card you would have to cancel the card in a scorched-earth sort of move to stop someone from charging who didn’t want to.
It’s important because there are a lot of important things that you cannot pay for without this form, which you cannot get without a French bank account. Some things we ran into fairly quickly were rent for the apartment, real SIM cards, co-working space rent, and gym memberships. Our utility costs happen to be either included or passed onto us by the landlord, otherwise I assume those would require a RIB too.
So, for the love of God, start getting a bank account the second you hit dry land. I tried getting an account before we got here, but essentially got nowhere with it. Everyone told me to just come in when I arrived in France.
About a week after landing, I finally got it together to email a bank. I contacted Crédit Agricole d’Ile-de-France through an English version online form on their website. I can highly recommend them. They contacted me back almost immediately after filling out the form (June 18th, while I was still in the US) and I got back to them 2.5 months later (Sep 1st, after we moved in) and they immediately helped me through everything.
You will have to bring:
Passport
A utility bill from your home address less than 3 months old (electricity, water)
Proof of income (payslip or Tax statement)
Your last 2 months bank statements from your main account
Now, since we just moved in and didn’t have a utility bill in our name, we instead had to bring in a utility bill in our landlord’s name, plus a copy of their passport and a letter saying we live at their address. Luckily our landlord had done this before and got us all the documents we needed within a few days. The other documents we already had copies of from our visa application process months earlier.
The guy that helped us, Kristopher, was a super English gentleman and could not have been kinder or more helpful. We had to go in person to their office which was over in the 12th district, but it wasn’t too bad. The process took about 45 minutes in a private office with Kristopher and we had the RIB that day and I went to pick up the chip cards from the same office a few days later. Then we went to a local branch, took out about $400 from our Chase account and deposited it into our new CA account to get it going.
My only real advice here would be to do this something like the day after you land rather than a week or two later. Actually, it’s best to do whenever you can get the residency documents from your landlord — maybe even let them know you’ll need these before you arrive so you could get this done on the first day.
Finally, I should cover how to get money into your account. You can certainly wire funds, which costs about $20 per wire I believe. Unfortunately for us, we hit a bit of a race condition here. We had already switched our phones to French pre-paid SIM cards (more on that in a bit), but we couldn’t add a wire recipient without SMS confirmation. I suppose we could have called them, but I really hate talking on the phone to banks so I sort of avoided it. It’s on my list of things to do.
What I’ve been doing in the meantime is using PayPal. I set up a new PayPal account linked to my French account and I send money from the American account to the French account and then deposit it. It doesn’t seem like a horrible exchange rate and if you fund it via the linked bank accounts the fees aren’t bad at all. It takes a few days, but it works. Also, be warned that if you try to send more than €2,500 you will get flagged and need to upload pictures of your passport and whatnot to PayPal so they know you’re not laundering money. I’ve actually hit a lot of really annoying things lately due to people wanting to make sure I’m not laundering money.
If you’re smarter than I am and still have your old SIM and can add your new French account as a wire recipient on your US bank account, I’ve been directed by my European friends to a site called TransferWise. They apparently have great rates for international bank transfers like this. One of my next goals is to get this working for me so I don’t have to keep doing this PayPal hack.
We’re going to be here for a while, so we definitely needed local phone plans. Not having data on your phone while trying to navigate around and find places gets frustrating really quickly. Using your American phone account to do so get expensive really quickly.
One of the very first things we did the day after we landed was walk over to an Orange shop and buy prepaid SIM cards. For those of you who are American and have no idea what a SIM card is, it’s a tiny little card that goes into the side of your phone that changes it’s carrier and phone number. Most Americans never change these but it’s fairly common in Europe to have a few of them and swap them out when you visit other countries — like have a German SIM and a UK SIM, etc.
You can pay about €5 for the card and €30 to fill it with a plan that lasts a few weeks and gives you 1Gb of data during that time. It takes a few minutes of waiting in line (I think it’s illegal to not wait for at least 20 minutes after entering a mobile phone shop here), but then you leave with a working phone. Many Americans may also not know if their phone is unlocked, meaning the phone allows you to change the SIM out at all. Most iPhones sold in the last few years have come unlocked, but you can also call your carrier and ask them to do so for you.
That lasted us for a week or two, though you need to be careful what you do with it. If you accidentally make an international call you can exhaust the credit really quickly and then you lose your data too. After a really long time I finally figured out how to recharge it. You can go to recharge.fr, click on the Orange carrier, choose the €5 or €10 plan, pay with PayPal and then text the confirmation number they give you (a 14 digit number) to 21224.
Jessica’s phone kept draining super quickly for some reason that we couldn’t figure out. For a while I had to recharge it almost every day, it was super annoying. My HTC One M8 only had to be recharged every week or so.
Eventually we wanted to get real SIM cards with plans. For one, the prepaid cards don’t let you connect to 4G, so the data is slower than it could be. For another, you don’t have a card on file with them so you can’t recharge very easily. It’s also almost impossible to figure out why you’re running out of credit. There are packages for €40/mo that give you 7Gb of data per month and 4G access. The catch is you need a RIB and proof of residency. Once we had our bank account, we went back into the Orange store and signed up for a year contract to get the better SIMs. Remember to make copies of the residency documents you took to the bank, because you’ll need them again here.
When you get here, it’s going to be tempting to Amazon things that you need to yourself, but the issue is that there are very few apartments where they can drop stuff off for you. Unless you’re home all the time, they’ll show up to your place and then drop off the package at a point relais or “relay point”. This could be a grocery store or a pharmacy or a laundromat. If you’re lucky, this will be a point that’s close to home. We ordered a couple of household items that we couldn’t find around town our first week and had 4 packages delivered to 4 different places, some of them a mile away. Not only do you have to go get them, but then you have to haul them back to your place. If you order something heavy, it’s up to you to walk it back to your place.
Also nobody that handles these relay points speaks English because why would a non-Frenchman be sending packages to themselves via relay points? This is not a super-touristy thing to do. The first one I did was pretty painful, I had no idea how to say why I was there and I didn’t have a drop slip with me that they usually leave in your mailbox. The important word here is “colis”, which is what they call this type of package. Just mutter something like “j’ai un colis ici” and hand them the slip and your passport and they can generally figure it out. If you don’t hand them your passport the first thing they’ll ask you is a phrase containing the word “identification” (say that in your head in a French accent) — this is a good word to learn how to listen for because it comes up a lot and it’s easy to continue making them think you know what they’re saying by handing them your passport.
I found out later that Amazon.fr will let you specifically chose a relay point when you check out. This ends up being a way better idea because you can choose one much closer to your place and you can get to know the process there a little better. You can also log into Amazon.fr (which is a totally separate site) with your normal Amazon.com account and pay for things in USD instead of taking the currency conversion hit, which is also nice. This can be really helpful for getting things together in the first few weeks.
The metro in Paris is fantastic. If you’re living in San Francisco, it’s almost hilarious how much better public transportation in Paris is compared to the city with the world’s worst public transportation system outside of LA.
The trains go everywhere, it’s simple and cheap to get tickets and the trains come basically every 2 minutes. I think the longest I’ve waited for a train in the month I’ve been here is probably 6 minutes and I’ve taken them pretty much every day. There are at least 4 major metro stops within a few blocks of our house.
We donated our car to KQED when we left San Francisco, and it’s been pretty amazing to have not needed a car at all in over a month. If we do need a car, Uber is also operating in San Francisco, and the accounts we already used still work fine. You can launch the app and get a car within a few minutes. Not only that, but since you can now put a destination in it helps with the language barrier in trying to inform your driver of where you’re going if they only speak French.
If you are in Paris for any amount of time over a week, you should definitely get a Navigo card. This is another thing that took me a bit of time to figure out. Paris has a RFID card that you can load up with credit and use to get onto the metro without having to buy tickets. You can load it up with either a week or a month, I believe. It’s actually a little confusing when you first get here because they have these recharge stations that don’t dispense tickets but can only recharge these Navigo cards, but they don’t dispense the Navigo cards themselves. In Tokyo, for example, you can get a card like this from a machine in the subway station (good ol’ Pasmo), but here you cannot.
To get a real Navigo card, you have to be a resident. However, I think fairly recently, they added a Découverte card, which you can just buy as a visitor. I believe you can get these at the manned booths at the train station, but those guys always seem a little pissed, so instead I went to a tobacco shop. You can find these shops every few blocks around Paris. They usually have a “tabac” sign and an RATP sign that’s fairly easy to identify. If you see one, just duck in and say anything resembling the word “Navigo” and they’ll know what you mean. I think it costs €5 for the card and you can normally charge it there with either one week or one month of use. I got cards for all three of us and it’s way easier than buying a hundred of the little one-way tickets. If you’re in Paris for even a week and are going to be using the Metro a lot, pick up one of these cards.
They also have this weird thing in Paris where any membership cards you get they want you to put your picture on. They don’t do it themselves, they give you a card with a sticky area on it and expect you to go to a photo booth, print out a picture and affix it yourself. The Navigo cards are like this and a year membership to the science museums we got for Jo was like this too. They have these booths in a number of the Metro stations and they also have one at the FNAC, the sort of Best Buy of Paris.
It’s important to understand that there isn’t really a thing here like American breakfast. It’s called “petit déjeuner” but it’s really just like a coffee and a croissant.
Just learn to not expect eggs and bacon and pancakes first thing in the morning because it’s almost certainly not going to happen unless you go to a toursity place that has “American” breakfast.
Basically the most important thing to learn here is to say “café crème” (kuh-fay khremm) which is basically a small latte. They are delicious and sitting at a table on the street watching people go by slowly sipping a latte is something that simply doesn’t get old.
That’s all of the weird “getting set up” logistical stuff I can think of that we went through that might save you some grief if you ever do something like this too.
Having been here for a month now, it’s incredibly satisfying to feel a little more like a native by whipping out my chip card to pay for groceries or Navigo to walk through the subway turnsiles with Josie. Even just walking around with visitors and using my data plan or being able to give out a local number to people I meet here so they can text me is really nice.
We’re really starting to feel at home, even in daily life.

Some cities you simply visit, while others visit you. Paris is one of the latter. It doesn’t just stay in your memory; it returns through people, through unexpected messages years later. As if it still cares.
— Grandma, Paris is so beautiful!
I’ve been there several times, and each time it felt as if the city was waking up from a dream just for me. The Seine’s embankment was bathed in bright sunlight, boats gliding across the water, and the streets filled with women showcasing that elusive French chic — something indescribable that makes their outfits unforgettable.
I sang La Marseillaise in a taxi, much to the bewilderment of the driver, and my cheerful mood helped me meet new people.
One day, not knowing French, I walked into a café and decided to greet the waitress with a phrase from Moulin Rouge:
— Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?
She first looked surprised, then narrowed her eyes and smirked, as if evaluating whether I was naive or just bold. Only later did I learn that this meant, “Would you like to sleep with me tonight?” What a way to start a conversation!
By the way, my coffee arrived unusually fast.
I met a girl on the plane. She was kind, talkative, and suggested we meet up in the city. We sat on the terrace of a café near our hotel, drinking beer at a leisurely pace. She told me about her divorce, her family, and I just listened, smoked, and enjoyed the moment.
There are moments when the right place, the right person, and the right drink come together to create pure bliss. That’s Paris.
The next day, we both got food poisoning from oysters at a restaurant. After that, she distanced herself a bit, but we still keep in touch.
Sometimes I wonder — if not for those oysters, would we have met again? Or did Paris give us exactly what we needed and nothing more?
The Louvre was packed with people. Leonardo da Vinci’s works were breathtaking in their original form, but my heart was captivated by Murillo’s paintings. His beggar boy picking lice from his hair — wasn’t just a painting, it was a whole life captured on canvas.
In Versailles, I befriended an IT guy. He was shy, stuttered a bit, but I introduced him to two beauty-industry girls who radiated pure fun. During our tour of Versailles, we drank champagne at the back of the bus. The IT guy loosened up, and later, we all posed among the gardens, mimicking classical statues.
Turns out, life is beautiful when you’re surrounded by warm, tactile, and kind people.
Parisian skies are a work of art on their own. Impressionist painters knew how to capture their shifting tones, and their works fill the former train station — now the Musée d’Orsay.
Though I still find Gauguin’s escapades in Tahiti unsettling, I can’t deny the raw brilliance of his paintings from that period. They hold a special place in my heart. There’s something about them, wouldn’t you agree?
I met two sisters — one of them was a model, tall, slender, playful. We laughed a lot, I invited them to the museum, and later, we took pictures in front of the elephant statue.
I was small, she was like a fairy from a storybook, and her sister stood in between us. Paris creates strange yet unforgettable moments.
We drank beer right in front of the Arc de Triomphe, and then the younger sister let me take hundreds of photos of her in a gray coat with her blonde hair cascading down. When she lay on her back on the Pont Alexandre III, I realized that happiness is just a feeling of the moment.
The Loire Valley is a world of its own. Medieval halls, enormous vases overflowing with flowers, and the stories of marquises who lived extravagantly. That’s where I met a little girl traveling with her grandmother. She dashed through castle corridors, demanding that I take pictures of her in the most unexpected places — on rooftops, beside water lilies, even standing on her head.
On the bus, she insisted on sitting next to me, looked at me with her dreamy eyes, and said:
— Let’s sleep!
She was seven. It was both funny and surreal.
I wonder — if I met her ten years later, would I recognize her?
Paris allows you more freedom than other cities. You can sit in a café late into the night, talking.
— And sit as long as you want, thank God! — says a Notre Dame gargoyle.
At one café, an old man joined our table. He had worked with Tarkovsky, but now he was a hotel porter. His stories about cinema were mesmerizing, though we suspected he had once played for “the other team.”
At some point, he invited us to a nightclub. We went.
The music was strange — acid techno! One French guy from our group drank too much and was supposed to stay at our hotel because he missed his train. At first, we were happy for him, then we were worried — he disappeared.
I hope he just got on another train and now tells his friends about the eccentric group of travelers he met that night.
Paris is always fun, unpredictable, and exciting. It’s best not to plan anything ahead, because new people and places will always find you.
Some cities leave a mark on you.
Ten years later, the little girl from the bus found me.
— I’ve been looking for you, and I found you! How have you been?
I smiled. I guess she wants me to remind her of the phrase she said to me on the bus. No doubt about it.
Paris never says goodbye.
Paris always gives you a sequel.
Every moment spent with Ni unveils new dimensions of grace and mystery. Dive deeper into her world in:

Trying to get at those travel stories about the verve and the swerve. Not your typical source for travel advice. These are stories about how travel changes you and unfolds you, not how best to be pampered and coddled.

Our interest in travel has something to do with our need to find the swerve. The led-by-the-nose tours suit some but not us. We set out to build adversity and surprise into our personal all-inclusive package. We want to be able to remind ourselves that things like sitting between train cars as a result of thinking it was a good idea to save nine Euros on unassigned seats is nothing more than a gift from heaven to enhance our lives.
The hitches and unforeseen hesitations are the swerves that create the pulse of travel.
This was our plan as we set off to grab a slice of Northern Europe. I have never been to this part of the world and neither has my wife. It was a gap in our travels that we needed to fill. And it was the draw of meeting friends in Paris and Switzerland and the Netherlands that set the outlines for our itinerary.
Our overnight flight left me wide awake with excitement while Stefanie was able to snooze a bit. The route to Paris ran first to Frankfort with its awkward funnel through customs that a weary business traveler commiserated with us on, “The worst!” he said. No ranks of Uzi toting police at the airport as I was led to believe. Then on a jump flight to Charles De Gualle arriving in Paris in the early morning.
We got help with our transit connection from a group of young travelers who like us were trying to find the best and cheapest mode to city center. The bus into town seemed promising but more expensive then the Metro so we found our way to the train station and rode into Paris.
The outskirts were unimpressive. But when we popped out of the subway tunnel into city center we emerged onto that glorious limestone and Mansard roofed landscape of Paris I’ve known from pictures and film. Cafes seemingly every three storefronts, busy Parisians hustling off to work, we spilled onto these streets with our luggage in tow and tried to get our bearings.
Promises of easy access to free wi-fi went unfulfilled (as they would continue to be) so we asked the kind shop steward for directions to Petite de Champs, the address of our lodgings. He pointed us off on a tramp of about ten blocks which we accomplished and proceeded to turn down the street that had Petite de Champs in the name. We found the address over a door that was supposed to be green but wasn’t. Door locked. Asked at the cafe if we could borrow his phone to call the lady and she described her place in variance to what we were seeing. We should have known something was up.
She said the key was upstairs under the mat. Since we couldn’t get in the street door the cafe guy somehow produced a key and let us in. We lugged our travel belongings up four flights and upon winded arrival found no key under the mat as promised. We collapsed in the hall and a dog bark inside one of the flats brought a young lady to the door. Yes, address and apartment number were correct, no she didn’t know our host’s name. This is truly weird. We were clearly missing a piece to this puzzle.
Back we go down to the cafe to discover through a second call and the cafe man’s astute observation that there were TWO Rue Petite de Champs. This one was Rue Croix Petite de Champs (“the road that crosses” our Petite de Champs). So off we march to find the correct Rue and the aforementioned green door and all the details familiar to our host’s descriptions. Our first swerve.
To get to our real Paris abode we climbed another four flights of well worn stair treads to the sound of our screaming calf muscles and behold, find the key under the mat! Our room was tidy and totally sufficient to our needs. We managed to contact our friends who had been if France now touring alredy for a week and made a plan to meet that afternoon. After a long travel day with swerves large and small we settled in for a snooze.
That didn’t last long because we were in Paris and the city was waiting just out there! Off we went to find our friend’s lodgings which were in the same area of Paris, the First Arrondissement north of the Seine. We mapped out the walk to get there but to no avail, missing a turn and requiring further instructions from yet another in our chain of kind shop owners who served us so faithfully. Turning down Rue de Hyacinth we were greeted by our friend’s “Bonjoir” from his second floor balcony. We reunited with our good friends Wolf and Charlotte from San Miguel de Allende and Charlotte’s son Ethan. Sat in their salon (this is Paris after all) to catch up and make our plans for the next few days.
We launched off for an afternoon walk through the gorgeous and immense Louvre courtyards where a cellist was busking under an arch that led towards the pyramid.
Great acoustics there that did his talents proud. We lingered a while to listen and became acquainted with the magic that is The City of Lights. Then down to the Seine to see Notre Dame in one direction and Musee d’Orsay in the other. Our original lodging was to be on a barge in the Seine in front of the Musee but our host there had to cancel due to some hitch with periodic maintenance. Sadly, it was not to be for us but we had moved on. Walking back through the Louvre courtyard back into our neighborhood we found our dinner restaurant. I had duck confit which was fittingly outstanding. The waiter helped me learn to say “I don’t speak French” so I could beg off as needed. I was using “no parlez vous” which accused the person opposite me of not speaking the language. I was also working hard on my “Ravi de vous rencontrer” (“nice to meet you”) which served as my only accomplishment of a multi-word French phrase during our stay in France.
The next day Stefanie and I went back to the Louvre, this time actually going inside. We entered through the pyramid and sat down to map out our visit since this most enormous of art museums requires a strategy to trim the seemingly infinite possibilities. We headed first to the French and Italian painting of the 16th and 17th centuries. We were both stopped dead in our tracks in front of the Holbein portraits. Soft and pulsating flesh that has actual blood flowing through it as best I can tell. Firm and telling hands. Eyes that beg conversation. These people emerge from the years as fully alive and unburdened by any mists of obscurity history presents.
We found an amazing veiled bust of a woman in the Egyptian wing that stood our neck hairs on end. She had all the mystery of the ages wrapped in her half hidden face and could easily have been mistaken for the work of a modern master.
Rooms and rooms of paintings. On through early Renaissance Italian works where Stefanie called me back to pause because I had rushed by a bit. She was right as usual. These were delicate and everyday human renditions that broke from the religious/aristocratic subject matter.
Then rooms and rooms of furniture for the era of the the King Louis’. Seemingly endless collections of amazing craftsmanship but largely vacant of people who, including me, find the style overbearing and fusty. All that effort by expert furniture makers who I’m sure thought their efforts were proffered in a style that represented the pinnacle of everlasting beauty.
Finally, and more by chance than design we crossed by the famous “Winged Victory” to the more populated wing where the icon of all things art resides. “The Cult of the Mona” was in full throng and the packed room focused their cameras on the tiny, charming, sedate portrait that causes people with only a nodding familiarity with art to change their life’s course in order to view. The painting looks just like the reproductions and is just about poster sized as well. Nice but I wasn’t exactly moved to tears by the encounter.
“The Cult of the Mona” throng who were taking pictures, on the other hand, were more interesting to me. The cultural anthropologist in me was interested in expanding on the theory of large groups as they relate to cultural icons. I also wondered how time will operate on this painting. Will we ever actually get over it? Is there life outside the cult? In my picture of the swooning multitudes I counted three who where actually looking with their own eyes at that particular moment.
The next room is where I found my true joy. Against a side wall in a room full of absolute masterpieces was the monumental “Raft of the Medusa” by Theodore Gericault. Depicting the crisis moment after an apparent shipwreck in tossed seas (based on an actual shipwreck with tragic loss of life), the painting presents the survivors huddling and comforting each other while the more intact denizens of this piece of flotsam raise a red cloth to signal a far distant ship. An image of human struggle to maintain hope in the face of nature’s imposition of mortality.
We headed to our rendezvous (Paris thing again…) with our friends in front of Notre Dame Cathedral. We were late but they were later. Our plan was to walk into Sain Germaine across the Seine and time was getting way from us. That and the long line into Notre Dame led us away to cross the river leaving the famous Cathedral for our next visit to Paris.
The West Bank of the Seine is where we came upon the well known green boothed book sellers called “bouguinistes”. We strolled the Seine’s bank and examined the wonderful contents of each booth. Some had the uninteresting plastic tourists mementos but most had great old posters, postcards and photographs tracing the history of Paris. Several vendors were selling truly beautiful etchings and lithographs, many with cityscape and landscape subjects from the past centuries.
We turned back to review the stands once more because our target was the famous Shakespeare Booksellers shop. This landmark of Paris was owned by the person who first published James Joyce’s “Ulysses” and did it while others were still scratching their heads over it. Tight little aisles and racks of books new and old. And full of my favorite variety of human beings; those who read actual books!
Upstairs were small nooks and rooms like comfortable pockets with chairs stuffed right for a relaxed afternoon read. Quiet people with heads pointed towards some tome of literate fantasy or other account of the human project.
Outside we sat on a bench for a little refreshment and it turns out our choice was a famous place of repose. A group of tourists wanted to sit and have their pictures taken there. I obliged, by getting up and saying “What, did Hemingway sit here?” which seemed to amuse them. I’ll have to dig into the bench’s provenance.
We then walked into the neighborhood of Paris that took the prize from us both: Sain Germaine. Here is the true pulse of Paris; in the voices from the cafes and in the silence from old churches, in the beat of the people strolling at ease in the slanting rays of the sun, in the rhythm of five and six story grey limestone edifices capped with the Mansard roofs rising up to shout “Paris!”. I did not want this episode of our travel to end. The pulse had become my own.

Paris is commonly used in music lyrics. Why is such a popular subject? What does Paris mean in these lyrics? How do people perceive Paris?
The Chainsmokers define it as
“1: A sentimental yearning for a reality that isn’t genuine.
2: An irrecoverable condition for fantasy that evokes nostalgia or day dreams.”
Paris gives a sense of fantasy that people don’t have in their mundane life.
“We were staying in ParisTo get away from your parents”
— The Chainsmokers
It’s a place to runaway. It’s a place where you don’t have worry about all the problems.
“But how I’d love to go to Paris again” — The 1975
It’s a romantic and satisfying place that people want to go but never got to go.”
“You and me in ParisFree to be who we arePrisoners of desire”
— Karen Souza
It’s a place of freedom.
“We don’t need a fancy townOr bottles that we can’t pronounce’Cause anywhere babeIs like Paris in the rainWhen I’m with you”
— Lauv
Anywhere can be Paris if you are with the right person. This indicates that Paris is a romantic place filled with love. I have to agree that Paris in the rain is memorable. There aren’t many people with umbrelllas.
“I got Paris Blue hung over my shoulder” — Frequent Flyer
It’s a place that can bring sad and happiness at the sametime.
“April in ParisThis is the feelingNo one can ever reprise”
— Ella Fizgerald
Lyrics just say so much but it seems like it’s necessary to go now. It’s a place that cannot be reprised.
“We’re so Paris when we kissed, when we kissed” — One Direction
It’s more than a place now. It’s a description of how romantic people can be.
“Why oh why do I love Paris Because my love is here
She’s there, she’s everywhereBut she’s really here”
— Frank Sinatra
It’s back to the definitions of all of the above. It’s a fantasy place. This is my favorite song among all songs about Paris.
What’s so great about Paris? I had the same question until I saw the Tour Eiffel blinking at me at 11PM. (It felt like it was winking at me.) Walking around the streets at night with the wind blowing through your hair makes you forget about everything. Seeing Giuseppe Acrimboldo’s Four Seasons at the Lourve, you find out how paitings can communicate to you. Drinking a cup of espresso on the sidewalk makes you love coffee more than ever. Looking at all those famous people buried in Cimetière du Père-Lachaise makes you realize how at the end we are all at the same destination. As people said in thousands descriptions, “You need to see it to know what I mean.”
It’s a place that seems unreal and ideal.
Paris is the best representation of fantasies.
I’d like to live in the Paris for awhile.

It’s been a few days since I landed in Paris. I tried to write the first night, but I got about a paragraph and a half completed and had to stop because I was tired. Here’s what I wrote:
“It’s 7:28 pm in Paris and it’s been an interesting first day. The flight landed at around 1 pm and I partially slept on the flight. Enough that I didn’t feel that bad and that’s a pretty good way to start.”
Just a few minutes later, we went out on our first exploration of the area to walk along the canal St. Martin and happened to come across a restaurant we ate at last summer, Le Verre Volé. It was excellent and then we popped into a neighborhood wine shop and tried two glasses of wine that were excellent and with varietals I’ve never heard of before. It was a wonderful first day.
Our second day in Paris started out by sleeping in. I didn’t sleep well that first night and was up at 3 am not able to sleep. Then, we slept in and didn’t get out until 3 pm. The next day consisted of running some errands: eating at a now favorite boulangerie, Du Pain et des idées, (Considered one of the best in town), getting a new French phone number, going to the Alliance Française to check out the process of the placement test, then walking through the most beautiful garden on the planet, Le Jardin du Luxumbourg, and then deciding to head over to the Louvre, because it’s open until 10 pm on Wednesdays and we wanted to see if we could purchase our yearly pass, Les Amis Du Louvre. We were able to purchase our passes and decided to see just one thing…. Marcelo gave me the choice and because he mentioned Napolean III’s chambers, which I had never seen, we went there. I think the Louve is best experienced in small doses because it’s so so big and there’s so much to see. I was actually considering blogging about going to every room in the Louvre over the next year, since it’s something that I really want to see and experience.
After walking through Napolean’s palace chambers, we found a high rated wine bar with charcuterie in the Marais which was on the way back to our airbnb that looked good. We meandered there walking through areas we’d never seen and just as we came upon the Pompidou, we turned left and had an incredible platter of rillette, two types of fromage (cheese), and jamon iberico and another type of ham. SO good.
We literally walked outside after it was over, to see a bustlingly busy bar, or street, rather, since half the patrons were outside smoking, and thought, “Oh, this looks like a cool bar!” and started walking in only to find my one friend in Paris, there with a group of his other friends. This is a feeling I haven’t had in a long time. Walking around a place and randomly running into someone I knew. Capitol Hill in Seattle used to be like this for me.
Today, Day 3, we woke up and I had a coffee down the street at a Portuguese cafe with real Pastel de Nata (which were excellent), then we met our official translator of our Marriage Certificate to pick up our French translation to later include in my equivalent of a green card application. Then we get more pastries from aforementioned new favorite pastry shop and I went to the Alliance Francaise to register and take my placement test. We spent the evening at home, eating incredible organic cheese from the “Biologique” market a block away and drinking a ridiculously good cider for 3€.
Now that I’ve had some more time to think and process, I’ve come up with some things that have surprised me, awed me with their beauty, stunned me with their simplicity, and with their cost.
Easier than Expected
There were some potential hurdles that I was worried about that turned out not to be hurdles: checkin for the flight in Seattle, immigration and customs in France, and getting a phone. I was worried that a one-way ticket would sound off the alarms and that we would be detained by immigration. We even printed out the EU regulations in English and in French just in case a customs officer didn’t want to let me in the country. But, alas, they were not needed. I checked into my flight and went through immigration and customs very quickly.
Getting a phone number was also much easier than I anticipated. My husband is an Italian citizen, so he just showed his passport, and they started signing us up for our new phones. Oh, and it was also a lot less expensive than we expected. We got a phone number for 9€ each and then a monthly payment of 30€ which has unlimited calling in France and free roaming in Europe. We got prepaid phones for the first few months so that after we get our apartment, we can switch over to a package that includes internet.
I have been reading a book on Culture Shock in France and read that one shouldn’t smile too much and that Americans smile and French people find it unsettling. The woman who helped us with our phones was very kind and chatty and smiled a lot.
Misconceptions about the French
Everyone (aside from one, which I’ll talk about later), has been incredibly kind and helpful. We’ve had good service, helpful, smiling people in shops, and very patient people willing to help us out. Honestly, I’ve had an extremely positive experience here in France every time I’ve been here and running into one person having a bad day doesn’t mean that every French person is rude.
Ok, the one rude person was the checker at the nearby supermarket. I waited in line for my turn and when it was my turn, I put the shopping back on the counter so he could check my items. Apparently, I was supposed to take them out of the basket, because in a huff, he dumped the basket over, toppling out all the items and then glared at me. I didn’t laugh, but I thought about how it must be a stressful time of day since the line was long and he was the only person there. Eh. Whatever. I know now to take them out when I see him. I tested out this theory getting some groceries tonight and the woman at the other market was super nice and just stared checking the items out of the basket before I could take them out. Ok, it was just that guy.
The French don’t speak English. Wrong. We literally have to continue speaking in French to people once they realize we aren’t native speakers or we are a little slow. Marcelo is MUCH better than I am at French (speaking both Portuguese and Italian, the roots of the words are very similar) and he told me this would happen. Just keep speaking in French, even if they respond in English. I’ve been tripped up a few times, but most of the time, I can follow what’s going on, even if I can’t say exactly what I want to say. So yeah, everyone has been incredibly helpful and speaks English pretty well.
Some fun cultural differences
You bag your own groceries and you always pay extra if you need a bag. Everyone carries around reusable bags to use for groceries. I still need to get one of those (I know I have one at home, but sadly, didn’t bring any with me).
Get used to waiting longer than you think. Another fun cultural difference was having at the wine and charcuterie last night. When we got to the wine bar, the one guy who was working said we could sit wherever we wanted and that he’d be right there to check on us. He gave us menus, and off we went. There were two tables available (and we had a reservation, so it was nice that we had a choice). One was cramped in between other tables and the other had more room around it, but it had dirty plates from the previous guests. We sat at the nicer table with more room, but with the dirty dishes. Surely, he’ll be by soon to pick them up…
…
After about 10–15 min, we are questioning what was going on. We look over and realize he is the only person there and that he is preparing all the food for everyone. Ok, makes sense. It’s a small place, but he’s busy. We discuss whether it’s culturally appropriate to give him the dirty plates. We could smell some of the paté from the previous plate and well, we kinda wanted to not smell it. Marcelo thought that would be considered rude (I think generally American Type A-ness is considered rude in France), so we opted to move them to the other, sill vacant table. Marcelo took them over and then came back a mix of shocked and horrified and said that everyone in the restaurant turned to look at what he was doing. Apparently, you’re not supposed to bus a dirty table, or move them to another table.
Around 25 min after we arrived, we still hadn’t ordered. The waiter came by to say, “Just a minute,” and “We ran out of bread so I have to go get some next door.” And then ran out of the restaurant, had a smoke break while he was chatting up the cute girl up front, then came back several minutes later to cut the bread and brought it out to the other tables.
Then, he took our order. We didn’t know how the menu worked, so we had to ask a few questions and he then had to bring another menu and we waited again for him to come back… after we ordered, he put together the plate and well, the photo says it all. It was shockingly good. The rillette alone was amazing, the wine was perfect, we both had a different favorite cheese and there was a moment half way through the meal that I realized that the Jamon Iberico was most likely literally from Spain. It was excellent. And my Spanish friends out there will be proud to know that the Jamon truly represented Spain well. Love.
Nothing goes to waste. Oh yeah, I forgot the other thing about the bread. After the other table left, he picked up their bread basket and put it on our table, next to the fresh basket of bread that he brought us. Marcelo pointed out, “You’d never see that happen in the US!” True that. Nope, but I didn’t mind. I’m glad it wasn’t thrown out. It would have totally been a huge waste because the bread was so good. I think Marcelo said it best when he said, “This meal couldn’t be eaten without bread.”
Eggs are kept outside the fridge. Really? Yeah, really. We looked this up last week because I didn’t believe Marcelo when he said Europeans don’t refrigerate their eggs. We found this short video that explains why. But yes, it’s true:
Wine is crazy inexpensive… and excellent. It was hard to find bottles over 8€ in the store. Tonight, we had a crazy inexpensive cider for 3€. We splurged to get a Morgon, (A particularly amazing Beaujolais) for about a quarter of what it would be in Seattle.
I have so much more to write about and so much more to say, but I’ll leave it here for now. For those following my instagram, you’ve seen more, and I promise some of that will make it into this blog too. Some of it won’t. Like how we happened to come across a game store, only to find it’s solely a Warhammer store. They kindly invited us to do a quick demo of the game and miniture painting and also directed us to another nearby board game store that sells the games we’re used to. I didn’t take a photo, but I was impressed. Games were similarly priced, or less expensive, than in the US. I seriously thought everything would be expensive, but no, life is not only much better here, it’s also less expensive.

What you have to do to prepare to move from San Francisco to Paris in three months.
So, you’ve decided to move from the United States to Paris, France.
Perhaps like myself you made this decision more or less on a whim with no real planning going into it before the decision was made, or perhaps you took a longer, more reasonable approach to the problem. Either way, you now have a series of things to do before you board that airplane.
Now, I should preface this by saying that I’m not a lawyer and I’m not a travel agency. I did find it useful, however, when I was planning my move to read through the notes of other people who had done roughly the same thing. There are only a handful of them on the internet (here are some) and if you’re seriously considering doing this, read them all in addition to this. Your mileage is certain to vary.
What is amazing about this process is that most of it is dictated by government agencies, and yet nearly every step of the process is insanely vague. Therefore, I feel that sharing what we experienced could be hugely helpful to someone else trying to accomplish the same thing. Reading through the consulate docs are one thing, hearing the story of what real people went through is a bit different. Again, this is not a how-to, this is a how-we-did-done.
Well, first things first, getting a French visa. In order to live in France for longer than the normal 3 months a tourist visa gets you, one has to get a long stay visa of some kind. There are several different types of long stay visas you can get, though most are super specific — being a student or an au pair, or marrying a French person. The one that seemed to fit us best was the “D” visa or long stay “visitor” visa. This is actually a little confusing to everyone involved, because I’m going to be working from home essentially, but not for a French company and not doing business in France.
The “D” visa essentially asks you to prove that you can live in France without ever being in danger of getting a job at a French company. I believe it’s normally for people who sort of want to long-vacation in France or semi-retire there, but working for a strange company that lets you work from anywhere fortunately and also occasionally frustratingly blurs the lines. Countries don’t really know what to do with people like me. However, this is the best option I could find that fit me.
Now then, there are 14 steps to the visa application process.
Most of these were actually fairly simple. Some pictures at the Kinkos, fill out the visa form, get your passports, birth certificates and marriage certificate together, etc.
There were, however, some difficulties. Many of which may have been easier had this blog post existed for me.
The first was the “Letter promising not to engage in any employment”. I have no idea what this means. What’s even more confusing about it is that the next thing you need is a “Letter of employment”. This is one of those many instances where language is really quite vague. What I ended up taking this to mean, and which I basically had to specifically verify with the Visa Officer at the French Consulate, is that they mean “We need a letter saying you won’t get a job at a French company, depriving a Frenchman of a job, so prove to us that you have your financial shit together”.
Figuring out what that letter was supposed to say in order to get it signed and notarized was also a little frustrating. There are no templates or anything. We ended up just writing:
“I, <your name here>, promise not to engage in any employment in France.”
And then signing it. And then notarizing it. And then getting weird looks from the Notary Public because why the hell would you notarize that? We got it notarized at the Post and Parcel in Potrero on 18th St. They were super nice and patient with us, I highly recommend them.
The letter of employment was sort of weird, since I’m a cofounder and board member at my company so I was unsure who I was supposed to get to sign it. “Dear France, I work for me. Love, Scott”.
I assume, however, that most people don’t have that issue. They ended up not accepting it anyhow because it didn’t state that the company planned to continue to employ me once I was in France, which is what the consulate was looking for. If you do this, be sure to get that in the letter, in addition to your salary and title. In my case, the proof of means of income was enough that they didn’t much care about the employment letter — basically as long as they don’t think you’ll try to get a job for a French company or that a Frenchman could get, it doesn’t seem to concern them that much.
Proof of medical insurance was a pain for me, but mostly because it’s fairly rare for a US worker to move overseas and need to transition to expat insurance. Most of this was handled by our insurance broker eventually, but coming up with our medical history and whatnot took up most of a day. I ended up going into the consulate with emails saying I was going to get expat insurance and that I had travel insurance currently and they ended up being fine with that. I should do another blog post at some point about how ridiculous the American health care system is and how insane it is that we don’t really own our own medical records, but that’s for another time.
Proof of accommodation and the e-ticket were interesting requirements because they both require you to expend a rather grand amount of money to apply for a visa that in theory you may not be granted. I’ve heard on other blogs that you can get hotel accommodations and a refundable ticket to hedge your bets, but we actually rented a furnished apartment through Lodgis and bought our one way tickets before applying for the visa. Needless to say, I’m pretty glad we ended up actually getting it.
While we’re on that subject, here’s a quick tip. If you move to Europe for a year, buy round-trip tickets. Technically you can’t get a return ticket a year out, so I’m not saying figure out when to come back. I’m saying burn the return ticket.
I didn’t even think about it and one-way tickets were about $2200 each on United so I ended up getting us tickets on Canada Air with a stop in Toronto for about $800 per ticket through some super-shady seeming Kayak referral company. I was fairly certain we were going to get to the airport and the flight wasn’t going to exist.
However, if I had selected a round-trip flight with pretty much any return date, I could have gotten non-stop flights to Paris through United for like $1100 per ticket. Basically adding the extra 15 hour flight home saves you half of your ticket price, contrary to all rational possible logic.
For the love of God, buy round-trip tickets.
We also had to get Josie a new passport since we got her one when she was only a few months old and they only last five years. The passport you have when you apply has to be valid a few months past the end of your stay. Since Jo was almost five when we applied, the passport would have expired during our stay in France.
Getting a new one for her was pretty interesting. We had to do it in person since she’s a minor and appointments were all months away so we had to use the first-come line at the Post Office on Sutter.
There is basically a single place you can get same day passport appointments in San Francisco and it’s pretty much a total shit show. The office opens at 8:30a and by 8:32a there are 15 people in line for a single person working the Passport counter and each applicant takes at least 10 minutes. If you’re there the second the office opens you still have a 45 minute wait. The first time we showed up, I forgot a document too, so we had to do it a second time. Make sure you have everything before you go. Or plan this far enough ahead of time that you don’t need to go into a no-appointment passport office.
So we made the visa appointment about a month and a half in advance and set to work doing all of that, which was pretty easily do-able within that time. Other than the health insurance issue, which ended up being fine, we had no other real problems with any of the requirements.
The visa appointment itself almost could not have been easier. For one, we lived in San Francisco, so we could easily go there in person without having to travel or anything. I had also heard that it could be difficult or confrontative, but everyone we met was really patient and nice to us. Some consulates ask for a “statement of purpose” I’ve heard, but the San Francisco one did not and honestly I think the French are generally like “Of course you want to live in France, France is awesome!”
The only problem that we had was that we physically had our documents in the wrong order. They want them all in exactly the order listed, per person. We had something like “one for me, one for her, next for me, next for her”, etc. They wanted everything for me in order, then everything for her in order. We had to stand there and reorder everything and I don’t think the consulate officer was super happy with us about that. So, make a note if you’re doing this with your family.
Also, minors don’t need visas. Obviously we would have had to get her a new passport anyhow, but we didn’t need to pay the application fee or get her photos or anything. They ended up processing it for her and surprisingly actually issued her a visa (which the officer said they normally don’t do for minors), but it wasn’t necessary. It turns out if the parents get visas, they let their children come with them.
The next step was to find a school for Josephine. This was actually one of the first things we started looking for, but it took us a while to choose, apply for and finalize. It was also pretty stressful looking for a school when you can’t really visit any of them, communicate or search very well in French.
I first started emailing schools in early May, before we had really decided to move. Getting Jo into a school that we felt comfortable with was a prerequisite to moving at all.
It was actually a pretty interesting juggling act, because we wanted to find an apartment, a school for Josie and a language school for Jessica and have them all be relatively close or commute-able. We decided to start with Jo’s school and we narrowed it down to six schools that have at least some English instruction (we had heard that it can be very stressful for English-speaking children in fully French schools as they’re basically special needs children and we’re not citizens — it gets confusing).
A lot of the choices came from an article on EasyExpat.com and a few other searches. We basically ended up deciding based on the fact that only two of the six schools got back to my email at all and one of them was very responsive and easy to communicate with. Perhaps not the greatest way to choose a school, but possibly not the worst way either and it seems to be working out well for her. They do French about half the time and English the other half.
If you are considering moving to Paris and have a child, the following school was personally recommended to us by a local as a great bilingual school for kids who speak English: L’École active bilingue Jeannine-Manuel in the 15th arrondissement. They also recommended École Alsacienne in the 6th, which is on the EasyExpat.com list, while Jeannine-Manuel is not.
We ended up finding an apartment that took cats (whom we decided to try to take with us, more on that later), had an extra room for me to work in and was furnished. It is also nicely close to a Metro line that goes almost directly to Jo’s school. Finally, it was only a short walk to a great language school that Jess decided to enroll in. Everything’s comin’ up Millhouse!
So now that we have a place and schools and plane tickets and visas, we’re really moving! Now the problem is what to take with us. Since the apartment is furnished and it’s going to have to be difficult to ship stuff to France, we decided to basically try to store almost everything. Like, everything we’ve accumulated through 12 years of marriage and 5 years of having a child. However, there were some children's books, technology and clothes and things that would certainly be more than we could check and didn’t really want to re-buy, so we decided to try to ship a couple of boxes.
So now the question is, how do you get a few boxes of stuff shipped to France? Turns out that it’s not actually very easy.
I found out that there is an International Flat Rate 25kg (about 50 lbs) box that you can, in theory, ship to France relatively easily. So we picked up four of them and packed them full and just stored everything else in our lives. This is sort of an interesting philosophical game within your family — what can you live without? At about $300 per box, it’s a really compelling question.
Well, I thought we could just show up to the FedEx with these boxes and pay the flat rate and boom. Nope. Turns out that the boxes are going through customs so you have to declare everything in the box on a form. Literally everything. If you have 5 pairs of shoes you have to list them one item at a time and put how much they’re worth and where they were made and where you got them. For each pair of shoes. I had fucking USB cables and shit in there.
This was incredibly frustrating because we had tons of stuff in these boxes. How much is a jacket you got 3 years ago at Marshall’s worth? I got super frustrated and came damn close to just walking out of the FedEx in a huff when Jessica stepped in and just went through all their hoops. Because she’s a better person than me. So anyhow, if you want to ship something this way, figure out what’s in each box exactly and be prepared for literally hours worth of paperwork at the FedEx office.
We are not smart people. We’ve adopted three FIV-positive rescue cats during our marriage, two of whom are still with us. Technically they’re feral rescues, but only one of them acts like it.
So one of the earliest conversations was what to do with the cats. Do we give them up? Do we see if we can get a family member to watch them? Do we take them with us?
This was actually a pretty difficult conversation because there is no way anyone would ever want these cats. They’re both super sweet, but they’re also FIV-positive which means they have occasional (or in the case of the one, constant) health problems. Problems which can sometimes be expensive. We are literally the only humans on the planet that would continue to keep these cats alive.
What made things a little easier is that it turns out, contrary to what we had both believed, domestic cats don’t have to go through a quarantine process. It’s actually somewhat simple to move to another country with them, process-wise.
You have to get sky kennels that meet the USDA and IATA requirements for shipping live animals. We initially got ones that were way too small for international travel and had to buy new ones. You have to get a vet that is licensed by the USDA to check the animals and they have to be chipped with an international chip and get a rabies vaccine booster. Then within a week of leaving you have to make an appointment to go to the USDA/APHIS office and present all of the forms that your vet gave you.
We went to the APHIS office at 389 Oyster Point Blvd, Suite 2 in San Francisco (really far south, by the airport). The USDA person there was super nice and everything went pretty smoothly. Our vet at the Mission Pet Hospital in San Francisco was able to put all the documentation together for us, including the French forms.
You can find most of this online, but in several different places and it can be a little confusing. We thought that we had to take the cats to a special USDA vet or something, but that wasn’t the case — our long time vet was able to do it and we just had to take the forms to the USDA/APHIS office.
Finally you have to call your airline and make sure they have an animal hold on the flight you want to book. Actually, technically, you want to do this first, since the rest of this is done in the last weeks before you take off. Then on the day of, you have to go to the cargo area of the airport and drop them off, present the forms the USDA gave you and off you go. When you land, you pick them up from the cargo area there. Not the easiest, certainly, but not impossible.
You can also bring smaller animals on the plane with you sometimes, but I thought our scaredy-cats would be less stressed if there weren’t a thousand people around.
Then it was just the moving process. We hired horrible movers who took forever, like multiple days, and still didn’t finish everything. Which means we ran out of time and I had to hire DeliverSF to come to our house after we had flown away to finish up everything.
We got an AirBNB in the last few days to stay in while we coordinated all the moving out and cleaning up.
Strangely, the morning we were to leave there was a 6.0 magnitude earthquake that woke me up a little early. I guess San Francisco didn’t really want me to leave. Finally, we got up and took a cab from the AirBNB in the early morning to the airport.
It’s actually pretty jarring to leave. All three of us have lived in California for our entire lives. Jess and I both grew up in Ventura and both went to college here. We moved to the Bay Area basically exactly the time we got married. Our entire 12 years of marriage, all of our real adult lives in truth, have been spent here. It is a world we know and a world we love. Stepping outside this zone of incredible comfort and support for us is harder than I thought it might be, the lure of adventure aside. However, I think it’s the right choice. Stepping into the uncomfortable is the only way to ever do anything truly amazing.
So, au revoir, San Francisco and hello, Paris! I hope you treat us well.

It’s been a good long while since I popped on here to share anything about books and/or life, but when life gets busy I tend to get quiet. As any of your in corporate life know, the first quarter comes in like a lion with everyone ready to do All The Things as quickly as possible.
But stepping back in time to last fall, I wanted to share two special trips that Sergio and I took in 2023. Coming into 2020 we had talked about our desires to take our parents on bigger trips — rather than looking back with regret when they were at an age when traveling was more challenging, we wanted to prioritize these trips.
One global pandemic and more than three years later, we finally made good on these plans at the end of 2023 — a trip to Paris and Rome with Sergio’s parents and sister, and a separate trip to to Prague, Dresden, and Berlin with my parents and my brother.
Anyone who knows me at all knows I’m itchy and somewhat twitchy if I don’t have a trip planned, but a multi-generational trip was something a bit different for me. Today I’ll share some highlights and what I learned from our first trip with the Ricos to Paris and Rome, but if you don’t make it any further than this, remember that planning — along with realistic expectations — are your best friend.
Alors…
I have nothing but love for Paris — and I’m talking about pre-influencer Paris, but the Paris of 2023 is far different than my first trip to the City of Light in 2008. Back then we carefully held onto our museum passes as they were stamped one by one, made sure we had enough euros for everything, and bought packs of tiny paper tickets to use the Metro.
NO MORE MY FRIENDS, NO MORE. If you expect to show up and walk into anything, you shall spend your vacation in lines. It’s not that Paris hasn’t always been this beautiful or popular, but that international travel is more accessible to more people than ever! This is amazing, but is particularly tricky if you’re going to tour Paris with people who aren’t ready to run to and fro, this is where your planning has to start.
After spending some time re-familiarizing myself through the prolific works of St. Rick Steves, we implemented one of my favorite travel strategies when traveling in a group, What’s Your One Thing? It’s exactly what it sounds like — what is the one thing in this particular city that you must do, that thing you’d regret skipping? Prioritization is critical on any big city trip, but when you’re considering different physical abilities or budgets, this is the best way to include the most-desired spot for each traveler (no-vetos!).
[Mine tends to be some sort of museum or cultural site because I AM ME and I could spend an entire vacation doing three museums a day and then reading alone in a hotel room at night but again, that’s just me!]
The great news? Paris has so many lovely sites and many of them don’t suffer from a repeat visit. We also tend to have similar travel preferences — none of us were there for the nightlife or the boutique shopping or Michelin restaurants. That made it rather simple to make sure that Sergio made it to Versailles and I got (another) visit to the Rodin Museum, which really and truly is my favorite in Paris while my sister-in-law got her show at Moulin Rouge.
With your initial list of sites, I recommend putting together a shared Google Map with all of the possibilities. This is important for any trip, but we found it especially necessary for traveling with our parents (all in their 70s) to minimize the amount of walking or number of Metro transfers. This allows you to make a call on what sorts of transport make sense for a particular city.
If it is accessible to you — and let’s be honest, a lot of it isn’t — the Metro is the best way to get around Paris (get a Navigo pass with a photo — it took us 45 minutes to figure it out but I was proud that we did it!). However, it’s full of steps with many stations lacking elevators or escalators. We lucked out in that we were able to make it work — barely. The traffic in Paris can be really horrific but we did use Uber when needed instead of walking (my personal preference) to make sure that we were pacing ourselves as a group.
Thank you, Internet, for making it easy to add restaurants to our shared map as well. If you spend more time than expected in a museum, it’s tempting to stop into the nearest cafe to eat. However, a little bit of research gave us multiple options to make sure we could find different types of cuisine to try (and was helpful for me given my dietary restrictions). We also split up at times to try different spots, especially when we had differing levels of hunger (Sergio and I tend to eat 3 American Square Meals and the rest of the family follows the Latin country cadence of breakfast, late large lunch, and small or no dinner).
Another set of activities that is great for senior travelers would be bus, boat, or (in Rome) golf cart tours! These maximize the sites you can see while seated, and, if done early in your time in a city, provide a good overview. I did a lot of research to pick a good boat tour in Paris and a golf cart tour in Rome because some of these companies really cater to the unprepared, which could mean more time in lines and possibly a sub-par experience.
Random isn’t a good plan for big European cities these days — you’ll need a reservation for major sites like the Louvre or the Eiffel Tower (which we missed — oops!) or you’ll stand in a long, long, long, long line, or just be completely out-of-luck. The Paris Museum Pass helps get you into many sites, but separate entry reservations are often required. In Paris, big sites also mean security lines and possibly restrictions on bags that you can bring with you. This is where a Rick Steves guide comes in handy — you can learn which entrance is fastest at the Louvre or how to see St Chapelle before the security line is too long.
What we ended up with was a great blend of structure and flexibility. We planned one key event each day (eg; a museum, a tour, a day-trip) and a meal together. This was usually in the morning, as getting to an attraction first thing can mean a shorter security line (sometimes). Because our hotel had a great breakfast buffet, it was easy to get up, grab something to eat, and get out off the door by 8:30 or 9:00. This generally resulted in a lunch around 1pm, which created a natural breaking point. Folks could rest or nap at the hotel, or we could go to other interesting sites or shop in the neighborhood. This left time to find souvenirs, try desserts, or find another Engligh language bookstore (hi, it’s me) or even just walk through a church or a park. It also means you’ll stop by secondary sites and get to know them well — whether it’s the very under-rated church of St. Sulpice, the Paris Zoo, the Conciergie, or Napoleon’s Tomb (aka three miles of walking that looks like three blocks — whoops!).
Paris is much easier if you can speak some French — and as the only sort-of French speaker on the trip, I was the one who stepped in if no-one spoke English. I find the French to be generally kind and helpful if you are polite (not a loud American) and are respectful. This means saying bonjour when you enter, asking before you handle produce at a market, etc. These are actually very simple things to do — any good guidebook can help you! — that show respect and create goodwill for an interaction. Most people in France can speak some English (or are completely fluent) and are generally willing to switch to English if you graciously ask, Parlez-vous Anglais, s’il vous plait? That being said, I knew enough that when we did encounter people who didn’t speak English that we were able to get by in French (think of immigrants who are newly-learning French to make their way in the country). I think with joy about a lovely woman who cooked us the best meal in France in a tiny kitchen in a market who spoke French and Arabic — so my sad French got us through it! It’s one of my favorite memories of the trip because you don’t need that many words to share a connection with someone else. Don’t always believe the hype — start by asking yourself how you can adapt to get the best experience and go from there.
But before too long, it was time to travel to Rome. After researching options the most cost effective — balanced with the amount of time — was to fly. All I will say is this — coach seats on ITA are punishingly small and you always need an extra hour in CDG, no matter how fast you think it will be.
So, let’s keep this honest. Italy is my least favorite country in Europe.
It’s closely followed by Spain (super surprising given that I visited it with a Spanish speaker, but it was the wrong type of Spanish, the Latin-American variety…), but I wanted to give Rome another good try. I know so many folks who love it and it’s full of incredibly history and museums, which is perfect for me. Our previous visit was in December, which was a little bit less engaging — and we also struck out the food. I also had travel companions that were incredibly excited for Rome, so I wanted them to enjoy it too.
Those fantastic planning skills I mentioned above? These were even more critical for Rome because holy crap was the city overrun with tourists in the second week of October and why is everyone doing a TikTok dance in front of the Colosseum? Given all of this, it’s much more important to prioritize your sightseeing and get creative with your entrance times and to make sure that you have enough shade, water, and rest for everyone, not just the elderly. There’s nothing like sweating through your entire outfit, right?
For some reason, some of the sites like the Colosseum or the Vatican Museums make it nearly impossible to get in without either buying a combo-ticket (which might include a site that you don’t want or an included meal you don’t want to eat) or joining a “follow-the-flag” tour. This was completely different than our visit six years ago, and it’s the absolutely worst. Most tickets are sold to resellars who maximize profit with these upsells, and even if you tried you’re not able to get these other tickets.
As a planner and an independent thinker I found this incredibly irritating and it felt to me like we had less flexibility! We had to check in more than 30 minutes early for a tour-guide who did a really poor job with the Colosseum, and without a combo ticket for a lunch we didn’t eat, we wouldn’t have been able to see the Vatican Museums or the Sistine Chapel (so you’re welcome, Pope Francis, for the extra donation to your country). Even with my months-ahead planning, we couldn’t get tickets for the Roman Forum — but in fairness, I was probably the most disappointed about that.
My favorite site this visit was the Capitoline Museum that overlooks the Forum and the Colosseum. Sergio and I hadn’t visited it on our first trip so this was my choice for my One Thing. We did it on the hottest day as some (but not all) of the rooms were air conditioned. With incredible art, architecture, sculpture, and views, it was almost tourist-free and quite enjoyable. The tablet guides were essential as none of us spoke Italian — and it was pure luck if you encountered someone who was fluent-ish in English. We also benefitted from an incredible cab driver who drove us around the back way so our older travel companions didn’t have to climb one thousand stairs to the top of the hill. I did appreciate the care and respect for elders that I noticed throughout the trip.
Central Rome is a rather compact, flat and walkable — minus temperates in the 80s and 90s and no real breeze to speak of. Another challenge to keep in mind if you are traveling with older people is that there is almost nowhere to sit down in public in Rome, and if you sit on the steps someone will come and angrily ask you to stand up. I’ve never been to museums where the only place you can really sit down is on a toilet when you need to use the restroom. Perhaps this is a reason so many people sit down in the church pews to rest aching legs and pray for a break!
The Metro is very limited so we used cabs to get around most days. Though they are in theory quite reasonable, we were overcharged more than once — even official cabs “forget” to run the meter. Because we usually had to take two cabs as we were five people, it was extremely obvious that a six to ten euro price difference in cabs that departed from and arrived at the same place one minute apart from each other were not on the up-and-up. Travel means getting ripped off sometimes, and thankfully this was the extent of it (or perhaps a slight mark-up on a dinner). We were very careful with our money and passports, especially in crowded areas, and we stayed in safe areas of the city. This is important for everyone, no matter your age, to be aware of your surroundings and know how to ask for help if you need it.
That’s not to say we didn’t have great cab experiences either — like this man who took all of us at once, or the gentle man who drove us from our hotel to the Vatican Museums, chit-chatting nonstop in Italian, but then, at a stoplight, holding out his hand to me and saying in perfect American English, “Hi, I’m Bob” and then right back to the Italian for the rest of the ride. Bob was good people.
These delightful local encounters are the ones I’ll remember the most, whether the accommodating and helpful staff at Hotel Lancelot, the wonderful woman who led our market tasting tour, or the staff at one of the cat sanctuaries who knew cat people when they saw them and let us get our feline fix, if only for thirty minutes. We were lucky to travel with two extroverts, and my beautiful and kind sister-in-law was made for the Italian joviality and spirit! Sometimes you envy those characteristics that are so natural for some people, but not for you.
Here’s the other part of a family trip that you can’t overlook — making space for alone time or couples time. As the most introverted person on the trip, I knew I’d do better if I built in some time for rest and relaxation. I chose not to go on a day-trip that Sergio planned for Orvieto — which was a wild success! — and instead visited a nearby church, had a long lunch, and napped and rested in our hotel. A part of planning is also understanding what each person needs from an energy standpoint. Do people need a midday rest or an extra hour to wind-down at night? Or do you do best with a morning coffee along before everyone else tromps into the breakfast room? Take that into account too — speak up for what you need to manage your energy and refrain from judging the energy or rest needs of your fellow travelers. We are all at our best when we can tap into the ways that we relax and recharge, whatever they are.
I do love trying local cuisine, so I made a point of getting deeper into restaurant research and we did find some real gems, from a wine bar across the street from stores that sold habits and candlesticks to a tiny neighborhood trattoria with the best truffle pasta I’ve ever had in my life. We splurged for one of Rome’s nicest old-school restaurant, complete with an incredibly kind waiter who teased and joked but provided best-in-class service and a whole plate of butter on request.
It was joyful to see these places through the eyes of Sergio and his family and to see them again in a different light for myself. I’m not naturally meant for Italy, I don’t think, but with a more positive frame of mind there were lovely things that I missed the first time around. And when you try different experiences and talk to locals, you can see a place through their experiences too.
The massive drawback to Rome was the hoards of tourists more interested in a dance or a pose in front of a fountain than learning about the two thousand years of history, culture, and all that happened in this place. It’s ROME! I wanted to yell at these folks who occupied whole sidewalks such that one had to step into traffic in the street to walk around them. This stupid sort of tourism that’s taking over places like Dubrovnik, Amsterdam, Venice, or Barcelona, not to mention the crush in smaller towns like Hallstatt, Bruges, or Porto. Of course everyone can want a photo to say, “Hey, I went to [insert cool place]!” You’ve been looking at our photos of amazing places that we visited throughout this entire blog.
But is that the attraction — just going there? Isn’t it more interesting to see the Chains of St. Peter or The School of Athens or Trajan’s Column? I’ll get down off of my cranky old person soapbox in a moment, but c’mon folks! You can sample great gelato and check out some art; you can get a cute photo at the Forum and see the temples. We are lucky enough to live at a time when we know more than ever about those who came before us and we’re lucky enough to have technology to help these sites come alive. There is a world behind a screen — so if you just want to hang out with your phone, give everyone else a break and perhaps stay home.
Where did I land with Italy? This second trip was certainly more enjoyable than the first because of my travel companions… and I think I’m good for now. We’ve visited about half of Europe’s countries, so I’m ready to see some of those first before another loop back to Italy.
But… all-in-all, this was a fantastic trip with all sorts of experiences where we lucked out with hotels and made do with the unseasonably warm weather. The planning truly made it easier to adapt to different travel preferences and needs, and I’d say the trip was a smashing success.
And now the plot twist. Because travel doesn’t always go as expected, does it?
We had all packed and were ready for our flights back home to the United States and Mexico, respectively. We had to be out of the hotel by 5:30am to catch our flight to London to transfer for our flight home and the rest of the Ricos had an 11:30pm flight back to Mexico. I woke up in a cold sweat at one in the morning and proceeded to be violently ill for hours and hours. I am so, so, so sorry to all of the poor people on our floor who had to listen to all of… that, but I was that special kind of sick where my only thought was don’t die don’t die don’t die. Sergio went down to the front desk in the wee morning hours and managed to keep our room for an extra day and change our flights with British Airways to the following day. I don’t remember much of it, but my body was shaking so hard with chills that my intercostal muscles ached for days afterwards.
This is probably a story for another blog, but I’m unfortunately much more of an expert on getting food poisoning despite how careful I tend to be with what I eat and drink. That is an unfortunate part of having an inflammatory bowel disease, but I’ve learned a lot through these experiences, and in the future I’ll find a non-gross, non-graphic way to share my recovery protocol.
I was very lucky to be traveling with a doctor (my father-in-law) and a nurse (my mother-in-law) and they have the world’s most tricked-out travel medicine kit that they opened to us. They were differently unlucky with their own flight delays (a late-night flight pushed eight or nine hours later into the morning)! Thankfully our second attempts at departure worked — we flew home without incident (and, in my case, with basically no food) and though it was a wee-hours-of-the-morning connection in Mexico City, the rest of the Ricos made it home too.
What would I leave you with from this trip? Do it. Take the trip and don’t wait. Make the best of what you have now because none of us are guaranteed good health into the future. In our case, all of the planning ahead of time made the trip much easier and removed a lot of mental load while we were there and gave us time to really connect and experience these places together. Whether it’s Rome or Paris, resting on a beach, climbing a mountain, or taking a cruise, you and your family are worth that time together. I hope you take it with those you love.
Au revoir, S
P.S. See you soon with a Jan/February book review and then (hopefully) another blog about our travels to Prague, Dresden, and Berlin with my family— our first European Christmas!

I kicked off the New Year alone in Paris with nothing to do.
It was my first ever New Year’s Eve spent out of the country, not to mention alone, and I had only a few short days to make a game plan. Right off the bat, I decided that, given the choice between an all-out nightclub with strobe lights and disco balls vs. staying home by myself with a bottle of red wine, I’d opt for the latter. But ideally I wanted to find some middle ground between the two — maybe a quaint bistro party with sparkling conversation en français, or possibly a sophisticated and slightly fancy family fête, complete with warm pork roasts, multiple rooms to roam, and a guest list of 40 people.
As soon as I started asking around, I quickly learned that local bistros either morph into club scenes or are shut down completely on New Year’s Eve. It would be hard, as a temporary city resident, to stumble upon the ideal setting and scenario on my own. I also discovered that most Parisians stay in for the ceremonious ball drop, surrounded by close friends and family, either gathering locally in the city or stead departing for their country homes. That left me with one option — somehow get invited to a Parisian house party.
There were two fairly significant problems with this plan:
Then of course there was the question of trust. You can’t just ask anybody off the street to join them for New Year’s Eve — there has to be some vetting factor to give yourself a little bit of security and peace of mind. So, over the next three days, I decided I needed to spend as much time as possible in local restaurants, cafés, and other local hangs in search of new friends to ring in the New Year.
As you know, I like traveling alone and do this with some regularity. It’s particularly fun for me to look for opportunities in social settings around me to interject myself and learn something new, and I have a few general rules that I follow when looking for the perfect hang:
With all this in mind, I set out to maximize the number of opportunities spent in these types of places over the next three days. Not going to lie — this is not always the most comfortable social experience. Here’s why. Even after I find a location — say, a café — that meets these criteria, the next thing to do is position myself in a location that invites conversation. If I’m at a bar or bistro bar, I will sit only one seat away from the next closest person at the bar, or sometimes even squeeze myself in as the open seat in between two smaller parties. This surprising social move, while slightly awkward for a moment, has been a pretty effective technique for me to at least trigger a small-talk conversation.
If there is nobody sitting in that area yet, the next best thing I can do is position myself in a highly trafficked location, make eye contact with everybody that walks by, and smile. In that one gesture I look for people who also happen to be showing up with a similar mission as myself: Making new fast friends. Sometimes, someone may walk in who’s meeting a friend running late, sometimes that smile may encourage somebody to sit down next to you, or sometimes I’ll get roped into a small group conversation nearby. Yes, I’ll be honest: This likely involves unbreaking eye contact with strangers for a few seconds longer than normal. The good news is that you can practice it and that there’s really no downside, as the chances of seeing anybody again are relatively remote.
If all else fails, I just use the resources around me and make small talk with the wait staff in French. In my case, this would inevitably throw off triggers and red flags to everyone around me that I’m not a native French speaker. Sometimes this would work to my advantage and another patron else would jump in and ask where I’m from. (People typically assume from my accent that I’m from the UK. On my proudest day ever in France, I was asked if I was from Belgium.)
But even if none of this happens and nobody strikes up a conversation with me, even if nobody sits close enough to me in order to start chatting, I have one strict rule for myself: Stay off my phone. Pulling out a smartphone at a restaurant or café is the kiss of death to meeting new people. It sends an instant sign to everyone around you that you’re more absorbed with whatever it is you’re doing, reading, or responding to than the environment around you. I’ve found that no matter how distractedly I fiddle with my phone, it’s still a real blocker toward meeting new friends in the real world. I try to keep it off the table and in my purse.
Instead, I carry a book. Oddly, reading a real, print book in public does not seem to have the same effect on people with regard to them keeping their distance. People seem to feel less threatened by it, and I get interrupted while reading all…the….time. The other benefit of having a book with you is that, even if you don’t achieve the holy grail of sparkling new conversation with strangers, at the very least you can fall back on a (hopefully) good read.
So, with this in mind and book in hand, I set out to make friends and conquer Paris. Some places where I made friends included:
But as of midday on December 31, while I had managed to meet about a dozen new people with these tactics, my New Year’s options consisted of the following:
Needless to say, this was not exactly what I was looking for.
When traveling alone, it’s always important to have a backup plan in any situation. In this case, my Plan B for New Year’s Eve was as follows: Wander around the neighborhood and try to find a happening (yet sophisticated) bistro party. (Note: This plan also also included stockpiling a bottle of champagne and some food at home, just in case I was unable to find anything interesting to do and needed to toast the New Year’s alone.)
I decided to take on a stretch of bistros in the 6th arrondissement along Boulevard Raspail, within walking distance of where I was staying. My loose game plan was this: Wander slowly past bistros, peer inside to scope out the scene and the people, and see if there is a venue or group that looks inviting enough for me to join. A few blocks away, I noticed a corner with 2–3 restaurants back-to-back. I decided to check it out. One of them was just a sit-down dinner spot, with families in mid-meal. The second was a bit more lightly populated without any buzz or energy whatsoever. The third, while also mostly comprised of families dining out, had one thing the other two didn’t — a large gathering area by the bar, which happened to be decked out with champagne flutes. Bingo.
Bypassing the crowds who were waiting for tables, I walked in, ordered myself a champagne, and waited. It was 9:30 p.m. Presently, there were two older couples at the bar and another family milling about. I guessed that more people would fill into this area as we approached midnight. I drank my champagne very….slowly…. But nothing happened. I passed the time by vigilantly watching the jazz combo that was floating through the restaurant and performing for different tables.
Unfortunately, by 10:15 p.m. not much had changed. Multiple other folks and families had wandered in and out of the bar, but merely as a holding area prior to their seated dinner. None of them seemed interested in talking to me. I was the only person there alone. Not great.
From the bartenders, I found out that there would be dancing downstairs leading up to midnight. “You’re in the right place,” he assured me. We’ll see about that, I thought. I looked outside. There were now easily 75 people waiting in a line to enter the building. So I decided to give it one more drink before trying my luck elsewhere. This time, I asked for a recommendation and was recommended a “mix-your-own” champagne cocktail with infused gin, raspberry syrup, and fresh berries.
About five minutes later, another couple approached the bar, decidedly younger than most of the other patrons I had met up that evening. They spoke in French with each other quietly as they poked through the cocktail menu, but then I heard the unmistakable query directed my way: “Excuse me, but what is it that you’re drinking?” I turned to see the woman pointing at my mix-your-own-drink creation and explained to her in French which beverage I had tried. She thanked me and turned back to her friend. She ordered the same drink. And, had I detected a faint accent in her French?
Going on a limb, I decided to try my luck, and I asked her in English: “Are you traveling in Paris as well for the New Year’s?” She looked at my silently for a full 10 seconds, and I panicked thinking how rude it was for me to assume her nationality. But then she replied. “Actually, yes. I’m working here teaching English to French children but I’m from Chicago. I’m Alina*. This is my friend, Georges*, a true Parisian, born and raised.”
This tiny intro was enough to catalyze a full-on conversation between the three of us, mostly in English, a little in French. I learned they were here because one of their good friends was the guitar player in the traveling jazz combo who had been performing around the restaurant.
“Oh bummer, you just missed them,” I remarked. “They were playing all over the restaurant but stopped about 20 minutes ago.”
“Actually, they are playing downstairs now,” Alina said. “We came to see them, and were supposed to be able to get in to see our friend but they told us that it’s for paying dinner guests only. We’re just waiting for them to come by the bar and let us down there.”
“Ah, so the dance party downstairs has already begun?” I asked. “Good to know. I’d love to check it out before I leave so let me know what you learn.”
We spent the next 10–15 minutes chit-chatting about my trip and their lives in Paris. He works in IT; she’s a new teacher who just moved to Paris a few months ago. They were both around my age. Georges grew up with Martin, the guitar player downstairs, and their friendship has continued to grow strong over the past decade or two. To show support for their friend, Alina and Georges left the house party to come and see their him perform. They really wanted to see the show.
At one point, Alina decides we should all make a break for it. Realizing that the entrance to the fete requires only acquiring a gold wristband at the door, we carried our cocktails and headed downstairs. Moments later, we found ourselves squarely secured inside of the jazz combo dance party, a spacious room lined on the perimeter with cocktail tables where families and couples sprinkled about. The room was bathed in a fuschia light, with the combo playing upfront. It’s decidedly classy. The lead singer fed the room’s vibe by offering us an American jazz classic; her nonchalance and easy vocalizations bounced off all of the walls.
The bar downstairs was lined with champagne flutes ready to be poured, and I headed over to investigate. But as soon as I did so, a man in a suit approached my new friends, sternly telling them in French something that appeared to make them both instantly dejected. At that, they started to head toward the door.
“Hey guys, wait — what’s up?” I called at them.
“We have to leave,” said Alina. “Apparently this party is for dinner guests only.”
“But don’t they know that you have a friend in the band?” I asked.
“Yes, we told them, but they are being super strict about it.”
“Hang on, that’s not fair. I didn’t have dinner here either.”
“Well you should stay for sure!” piped in Georges. “In fact, we need you to stay. Please go tell Martin how sorry we are that we weren’t able to see him.”
“What? So that’s it? You’re leaving?” I’m annoyed on their behalf. These folks came all the way from the 11th arrondissement to see their friend play on New Year’s Eve.
“Tell him we’ll be upstairs waiting. We’ll see you up there afterward I guess too,” said Alina, eying the door. “We have to go.”
And then they left, leaving me alone again. Glass of champagne in hand, I turned to face the music. But it wasn’t the same.
One of the best parts about traveling alone is that it’s pretty easy to slip through the cracks. If you walk into a packed restaurant with a line out the door, you can often cut it all on the spot by agreeing to sit in that one awkward seat at the bar. If you run into a café right as they are about to close, as just one person, they might make a late dish just for you. If you’re shopping at a boutique and trying to haggle for a certain promotional offer on your purchases, it’s more likely the shopkeeper will let an exception slide by for one person, as opposed to a small group. And if you’re hanging around a bar at a fancy bistro on New Year’s Eve for long enough, the bistro owners will decide it’s not a problem for you to bypass the “dinner guests only” rule and hang around until the clock strikes twelve.
But this time, it didn’t seem right for me to enjoy this party and the jazz combo while the friends who traveled across the whole city to see him couldn’t enjoy it too.
I considered my options:
Of the three of these, which do you think I chose?
A few more minutes passed as I assessed the scene around me. Waitstaff and bartenders were frantically darting in and out of the bar, preparing for the shift of the masses from upstairs to downstairs. But I needed a manager or head waiter of some sort. Finally, I saw a man in a custom-fit blazer race by me, monitoring the setting downstairs on his way.
“Excusez-moi de vous déranger, Monsieur, mais j’ai une petite question,” I announced. Translation: Sorry to bug you but I have a small question.
“Oui?” he turned his full attention to me. I began, to the best of my ability, a French persuasive argument.
“Well sir, as it turns out, I have two friends upstairs who at the bar who I would like to be able to join me downstairs. They are actually here because their friend is performing in the band, and they would really like to see him, but they were told that they can’t come downstairs as they did not eat dinner here. I understand this rule, but is there any way that they could come back downstairs with me to see him perform?”
He assessed me a bit more closely. I tried not to cringe at any grammar mistakes I had made in that plea. I thought about adding in one last caveat: “And since nobody here is dancing yet, I’m sure they would be up for it and liven up the room,” but decided against it, not knowing their tendencies in that area. At last, he nodded, took my champagne glass, and stowed it on the bar to be safe upon my return.
“Come with me,” he said. “Point out your friends to me.”
He hustled up the stairs, with me two quick steps behind. At the top, I stood next to him and pointed out the couple, and he rushed over to them, acknowledged what we had discussed, and began to lead them back in my direction. He had the hostess take care of their coats, and walked all three of us back downstairs together, calling out what he had done to the doorman on the way in.
And with that, we were reunited downstairs. Alina and Georges were elated, albeit a little confused. To be fair, so was I. But we didn’t overthink it. And within a matter of minutes, Alina (who apparently had taken years of swing dance classes back in the U.S.) was stepping her way around the dance floor. Georges, meanwhile, whose style seems more akin to that of Danny Kaye, literally stole the show on the last number with an improv piece of pantomime and hilarity as he cheered on his friend in the front of the room. It may have been one of the funniest things I have ever seen — it takes a truly brave soul to have no fear and to just dance with abandon like that. At the end of the set, the band got a hearty round of applause, and my new friends had their fair share of patrons run up to them and compliment their impressive dancing skills.
After the conclusion of the performance, I met the rest of the band, including Martin, the guitar player, and we spent the next 20–30 minutes chatting and dancing. But at 11:30 p.m., Alina and Georges realized that it was getting late, and they needed to head back to their other party. The three of them turned to me as they prepared to bundle up and leave: “Would you like to join us? We’re heading up to the 18th arrondissement with friends.”
I paused to consider my options. That was all the way across town, so if I were to attend, I would no longer be within walking distance of my return at the end of the evening. I looked back around the room again. While certainly a classy and fun party, being at this bistro alone was the epitome of finding loneliness in a crowd. Aside from Alina and Georges, nobody else had given me the time of day to chat. I decided I’d rather ring in midnight in the company of my new friends than around a group of anonymous strangers. It would be worth the trip. So the four of us hopped on the Metro.
As we approached the Concorde stop on the M8 line, my phone revealed that we’d crossed the threshold. “It’s midnight everyone!” I shouted to no one in particular. Our Metro car cheered. Outside we heard the roar of a collective crowd shouting and screaming somewhere above ground at Place de la Concorde. The doors closed and silenced the ceremony. Our driver gave the horn a few long “toots.” Alina started to sing “Auld Lang Syne.” By 12:01 we were already at the Madeleine Metro stop, and the moment had passed. It would be close to 12:30 a.m. before we would walk into the house party with more of their friends to be greeted by a warm group of Parisians in an apartment that smelled like a mix of champagne and cigarettes. And I wouldn’t have had it any other way.
*Not their real names.

In Woody Allen’s classic movie “Annie Hall,” he’s waiting in line outside a movie theatre and a pompous guy behind him is pontificating to his wife — pompsplaining — about Marshall McLuhan, the prophetic philosopher and educator on culture and technology. Allen gets into a heated argument with the guy, basically saying it’s ok to be totally wrong about McLuhan but just not so loud about it.
The guy self-importantly announces something like, “well I happen to be a professor at Columbia University and I teach a course on culture and media and I know my McLuhan.” To which Woody says, “oh really, well I happen to have Marshall McLuhan right here,” and he pulls the actual living Marshall McLuhan from behind a screen who proceeds to tell the professor, “I heard what you were saying, and you know nothing of my work. How you ever got to teach a course in anything is totally amazing to me.”
Is there any better way to win an argument? “Well, I’ve got Socrates right here and…”
As Woody Allen said, though, “wouldn’t it be great if real life were like this?” Which, of course, it isn’t. In real life, deliverance in an argument is many degrees of separation away.
Except in real life I had this experience (kinda) with a Pulitzer Prize winning poet. It turns out that only two degrees of separation is enough to get a real, live, acclaimed poet to personally settle a question about a poem.
But this was not a movie. In real life, nothing was delivered. I lost the debate.
I organize several poetry reading groups for people who are poetry-curious or poetry-reluctant. I’m no professor, no academic, I’m just an enthusiast who has discovered that it’s not hard to get even poetry-averse people enthused by and often in love with a poem, if the poem is any good.
For one group, I recently gathered a selection of poems about Paris, and one was by a poet whose name and work I was unfamiliar with. I had been hunting specifically for Paris poems so I’m sure I found this one by its title: “In Paris.” I was unfamiliar with the poet but instantly captured by the poem.
The poet is Carl Dennis. I figured I’d look him up to have something to say to the group. To my private (and now public) embarrassment and chagrin, Dennis was unknown to me but was hardly unknown outside my own little orbit. In 2002, he won a Pulitzer Prize in poetry, eclipsing the other two nominees, both of whom were future Pulitzer winners. His poetry has been published in many important magazines and poetry journals, including some I have occasion to read.
I also learned that Dennis taught for years in the English Department at the State University of New York at Buffalo, where the faculty included renowned poets whose names I did know and have even read, like Robert Creeley, Charles Olson, Susan Howe, Anselm Hollo, and Charles Bernstein. (Disclosure: I’m no fan of the “schools” of poetry these poets were part of and I don’t read much of their stuff.)
To make matters even worse for me, I went to SUNY/Buffalo. And I was an English major. And I was learning there (allegedly) while Carl Dennis was teaching there. We were one degree of separation away as I walked past his classroom.
Maybe he only taught graduate students. Or may it was the early 1970’s and I was a long-haired kid from Brooklyn whose main influence was Groucho Marx and Jefferson Airplane. And Dennis really was an unknown poet back then. So our one-degree gap was all it took to keep me in the dark.
But for present purposes, I now had my intro about Dennis for the poetry group. Everyone had a good laugh when I gave this background about my unknown poet, after which I read his poem aloud.
And for a long while no one spoke. You could hear the silent re-reading, the thinking, the unsaid questioning. We were all engaged, provoked by a poem, and, since the poem was about Paris, maybe a little in love. Here’s the poem.
Today as we walk in Paris I promise to focusMore on the sights before us than on the womanWe noticed yesterday in the photograph at the print shop,The slender brunette who looked like youAs she posed with a violin case by a horse-drawn omnibusNear the Luxembourg Gardens. Today I won’t linger longOn the obvious point that her name is as lost to historyAs the name of the graveyard where her bonesHave been crumbling to dust for over a century.The streets we’re to wander will shine more brightlyNow that it’s clear the day of her deathIs of little importance compared to the momentCaught in the photograph as she makes her wayThrough afternoon light like this toward the Seine.The cold rain that fell this morning has given way to sunshine.The gleaming puddles reflect our moodJust as they reflected hers as she stepped around themSmiling to herself, happy that her auditionAn hour before went well. After practicing scalesFor years in a village whose name isn’t recorded,She can study in Paris with one of the masters.No way of telling now how close her lifeCame to the life she hoped for as she rambled,On the day of the photograph, along the quay.But why do I need to know when she herself,If offered a chance to peruse the book of the future,Might shake her head no and turn away?She wants to focus on her afternoon, now almost gone,As we want to focus on ours as we standHere on the bridge she stood on to watchThe steamers push up against the current or ease down.This flickering light on the water as boats pass byIs the flow that many painters have tried to captureWithout holding too still. By the time these boats arriveFar off in the provinces and give up their cargoes,Who knows where the flow may have carried us?But to think now of our leaving is to wrong the moment.We have to be wholly here as she wasIf we want the city that welcomed herTo welcome us as students trained in her schoolTo enjoy the music as much as she didWhen she didn’t grieve that she couldn’t stay
Time steals us all away and leaves photos as proof of existence.
This narrative poem — a dramatic monologue — is teeming with imagery, feeling, and thought. Time, the ephemerality of the moment, Paris, romance, obsession, the flowing Seine, sepia-toned photographs, photography’s power and powerlessness: the group discussed all these things, and more I’m sure.
The speaker is in Paris with his — wife? paramour? friend? — and he knows she is frustrated with him. He’s obsessed with a 19th century photograph they saw in a print shop of a Parisian street scene with a woman carrying a violin case. He can’t stop thinking of the woman, long gone from Paris, faraway from now, and lost to history.
We all could relate to both sides of the poem’s modern-day scenario. On one side of the couple’s dilemma is the seductive power that a photograph has over the narrator (and, by proxy, over us readers). The other side of the dilemma is the “here and now” that the narrator’s companion wants to enjoy while strolling with her man.
Reflecting the narrator’s obsession, the present-day “she” in the poem is barely there. We know much more about the long-gone woman in the photograph. “Enough already,” we imagine the living woman wants to say, but she doesn’t have a voice in the poem. The narrator simply tells us, “She wants to focus on her afternoon, now almost gone.”
But wait! The woman who “wants to focus on her afternoon” is the woman in the old photograph, not the woman in the present. This man cannot stop thinking of that ghost in the image. “Paris is laid out in splendor before you now!” I want to shout at him. “Pay attention to the angel in front of you!” But I cannot reach the inattentive narrator who is just a disembodied “voice” in a poem, just as he cannot reach the woman in a faded image from the 19th century.
Look how he can’t stop himself! He promised — promised! — in the poem’s first line to “focus on the sights before us” rather than on the beguiling antique photograph. “Focus” is what he says — just like a camera does. Perhaps “focus” is not the reassuring word the narrator should have chosen, but it’s honest because his focus keeps returning to the camera’s subject a century earlier. He says he won’t “linger long” on her death, as he clearly already has and proceeds to do some more.
About halfway through the poem, the sun comes out and it seems like our haunted hero is going to come back to the present. He sees how “the gleaming puddles reflect our mood,” and he all but says “honey! I’m home!” But, no, he falls instead through the camera’s time portal back to the muddy puddles that his 19th century inamorata is stepping around as she smiles to herself. At this point in his preoccupation, the narrator exceeds the four corners of the photograph and simply creates unknowable facts about her successful audition and her musical studies.
Just as things are getting a little out of hand, the narrator — and the poem — asks an important question: why does he care what became of his enchantress if she herself, living wholly, didn’t care to “peruse the book of the future”?
Why does he care? What ensnares him? Photography gives us the illusion that we can stop time right — snap! — now. Old photographs let us imagine more fully this vanished place in that vanished time, like the prototypical 1838 photograph of a Paris street, above. They let us meet and look into the eyes of the dead. Haven’t you looked at a photo from, say, Coney Island in the 1920’s and thought “every one of these people is gone”? Or from the 1960’s and wondered “what became of them”?
Time steals us all away and leaves photos as proof of existence.
As if answering the question “why do I care,” the poem now plunges into the river of time with its boats and flickering lights and its Heraclitean flow, never captured in art, that leads who knows where. The narrator is having, perhaps, a mini-Whitmanesque moment, crossing the Seine rather than Crossing Brooklyn Ferry, seeing the same boats the slim brunette saw (“steamers”) and the same flickering lights she saw, and knowing now he must not “wrong the moment.”
When the narrator resurfaces, he knows it is important to be “wholly here.” (“Wholly” is such a perfect word!) Across a century, the woman in old Paris has reminded him that we are here but briefly, like the blink of a camera’s shutter. He comes to see that the city of Paris will “welcome us as students trained in her school/ To enjoy the music as much as she did.” Her school? The Music School of the Holy Here.
So wake up, take your present-day companion’s hand, and watch for puddles.
But there’s a little more to my story about Carl Dennis and Buffalo, New York. Though we might easily have knocked our coffees onto each other’s plaid shirts in the makeshift English Department hallways in, say, 1972, I assumed that 50+ years on, Carl and I had drifted apart to the expected six degrees of separation, or more.
But no, we were a mere two degrees of separation away. Go know! One of the people in the poetry group, Eva, lives in Buffalo. When we read “In Paris” in our group, she said, “Hey, Carl is a neighbor of mine! He lives a couple of houses away.” Wow! So do you know him? “Yeah, of course, but as a neighbor, not as a famous poet.” So cool!
We discussed the poem as a group for a good long time. It felt like we were on that Paris bridge, like we could see the woman in the photograph, like we knew how to be mad at our partners for “wronging the moment” and not being “wholly here” when presence mattered.
But then I pointed out: “look, this poem doesn’t have a period at the end of the last sentence.” It seemed odd to me, and I checked my source for the poem, the Academy of American Poets online. Nope, no period. See for yourself.
What does it mean to leave a poem open-ended like that? Poets don’t do this for no reason, after all. I’m sure I mentioned Emily Dickinson’s defiance of punctuation conventions.
What does the grammatical caesura do in this particular poem?
Does it hint at the continuing, endless nature of Time?
Does it signify something about indeterminacy? but of what? the moment? our relationships?
Are we intended to go back to the start of the poem, like James Joyce made us do in Finnegans Wake (mostly written in Paris!) where the final sentence (“A way a lone a last a loved a long the”) has no period and flows like the River Liffey into the opening sentence (“riverrun, past Eve and Adam’s, from swerve of shore to bend of bay,”)?
I even checked “In Paris” to see if that worked. It does, if you want it to.
Eva said, “I have an idea! I’ll text Carl and ask!” Fantastic! And she did. “Hey, Carl, we’re reading your poem ‘In Paris!’” And he replied something like I can’t believe anybody’s reading that old poem. And she then asked, “what does it mean that there’s no period at the end?”
And much like Marshall McLuhan, he replied, “That’s a mistake. It’s supposed to be there.”
So much for the River Liffey.
Ok, the sepia-toned woman, so busy with living, “didn’t grieve that she couldn’t stay PERIOD.” Got it. Message to the poem’s speaker from two women, one on the bridge now, one there a hundred years ago: when in Paris, be in love or at least be here now. PERIOD.
“In Paris” was published in Dennis’s 1993 poetry collection The Near World. Unlike the poem’s distracted narrator who was focused on the deep past, the poetry group was reading a modern poem written in our lifetimes. But we were like the narrator in one respect: we were enthralled. We were in Paris, and I think we were falling in love with this poem.
And now, weeks after the poetry group discussion, I find myself re-reading Dennis’s poem umpteen times, poring over it like a man staring at a very old photograph while I’m working on this piece. It’s taken all day, and soon my wife and I have somewhere to be. I hear her call from the other room, “It’s time to go. Enough with that poem already!” I am here and it is now and we do have to go.
Because the poem above is exactly what I shared with the group, you’ll note there’s no period at the end. Since I have it on good authority that a period belongs there, I’m duty-bound to offer the correct last line: “When she didn’t grieve that she couldn’t stay.” Ah, so much better!
“In Paris” lead me to Dennis’s books of poetry which are now 14 in total plus one book of essays. I’ve bought several now, including his last, Earthborn. Many colleagues and commenters describe his poetry as thoughtful, sensitive, focused on the everyday, accessible, meditative, humane. All true. But I haven’t found any mention of how funny, how deeply wryly funny, Dennis can be.
In “Primitive,” he refrains from killing a spider in his house in order to avoid the slippery ethical slope toward killing a few people he knows. In “Progressive Health,” he advises healthy organ donors for perfectly ethical reasons not to wait another day before donating their organs. In poems like “Eurydice” and “The God Who Loves You,” you’ll laugh but only to keep from crying. Find them, read them.
The God who loves me whispers that he bets that Carl Dennis likes Groucho Marx and thinks Groucho was a good a preceptor for me in college as any of Carl’s smart colleagues.

Helping You Adapt to Life in France

I’ve strolled past dozens of brocantes (antique fairs) in my decade in France, but it was only last month that I finally had a mission which took me to one as a participant, not just as a passer-by.
I often tell friends that it’s important to commemorate milestones as you get older. When you’re younger perhaps your family or your superiors will do it for you (a graduation, a promotion) but later in life your achievements and milestones can and should be marked in some way. I tend to do this with a gift which I would ordinarily not have bought for myself, but justified because of an achievement. For example, after a month studying French in the Alps I bought myself a Mondaine Swiss Railways watch. I’ve loved the design since the first summer I spent in Switzerland (2014) and was mesmerized by seeing the railway clocks at all the platforms I stood on. It wasn’t until 2018, four years later, that I “decided” to mark my quantum leap forward in French that I made in the Alps with this gift for myself.
That brings us to my citizenship interview of a couple of months ago and a desire to mark the end of several parts of various journeys. I have loved the classic designs of Saint James for some time now, but have put off buying one of their sweaters (jumpers, my dear UK readers) due to cost. Good, long-lasting clothing does cost more, and I’m not hesitant to pay…

Paris is one of the world’s great cities. History, architecture, museums, food, culture, beauty, and walkability make Paris one of the world’s most popular travel destinations, with more than 30 million annual tourists and millions more business travelers. Despite this, Paris has had the reputation of not being a great running city, with crowds, pollution, congestion, and relative lack of running culture being cited as the cause. But this has started to change in the past few years, and we’re pleased to report that there are some fantastic running options in Paris. If you are staying in the heart of the city, running along the Seine is a treat, especially since there are now seamless paths, separated from cars, that go on for miles. One can also put together a nearly 10-mile “highlights of Paris” tour, which includes The Louvre, Eiffel Tower, Champs Elysées, and the city’s famous parks and gardens all in one run. Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes are two large and wonderful city parks at either edge of the city. And running along the Canal St. Martin’s meandering paths out to Parc de Villette is a treat. Further afield, running at Versailles will make you feel like a king.
A great resource for running in Paris is Free Paris Running Tours. Luke and his team lead wonderful, free running tours of one of the world’s most beautiful cities.
Staying inside the main beltway surrounding Paris will provide access to decent running options (see our “stay” section for recommendations). Good anchor/departure points for our best runs are Notre Dame (“Cité), La Bastille, and La Defense. A few particular recommendations for running in Paris: if you want to see some of the ‘tourist’ highlights, try to go early to avoid the crowds; take advantage of the fabulous public transportation and bike sharing system, which puts you within a 10–20 minute subway ride from some of the best runs, or allows you to do a longer ‘one way’ run; and pay attention to closing times for some of the parks. Also when we say “12e” that means “12th arrondissement”.
Paris is generally quite flat. There are hills in some of the park runs. As for weather, in Paris it is fairly continental. Winters can be chilly and damp, with occasional but rarely significant snow. Summers are generally lovely, with long days, and rarely overly hot, but quite humid.
7.3 miles, RT. Start: Notre Dame, Ile de la Cite. MAPOptions for longer — head west on south side from Champs de Mars.
Running on the banks of the Seine is one of the great runs of the world. Over the past few years, several sections have been turned into pedestrian-only paths, below the road, making running along the Seine in the heart of Paris a running heaven. Along the river, there are also great views of Paris’ wonderful buildings and landmarks. Starting at Notre Dame (or any point), head east on Ile La Cite over to Ile St. Louis, crossing a bridge over to the north side, or right bank. Then head west along the river, passing numerous landmarks: Centre Pompidou, the Louvre, Jardin de Tuilleries, Place de La Concorde, and the Modern Art Museum. At just over 4 miles, opposite Jardins de Trocadero, cross the Pont d’Ilena, over to the left bank. Head back east. Some of the nicest sections of the river run are along a section called Les Berges, between the Pont de l’Alma and the Musée D’Orsay. This section was formerly a highway but was beautifully developed into a path two years ago. Shorten the run doing less of the path or add to/vary it with incredible detour opportunities: Tuilleries, Champs-Elysees, Jardins de Trocadero, Champs de Mars, and Invalides. Adding all those would make this a 10-miler or so.
7 miles, out and back. Start: Champs de Mars. MAP
This can be part of a longer run or a distinct run. We continue the above, running west of Pont d’Ilena, along the lovely thin path of Ile aux Cygnes, then doing a tour of the park on Ile St. Germain. It can be joined with any parts of Seine run above, or any of the wonderful detours.
7.5 miles. Start: Pont Neuf. MAP
This route has all the best of the heart of Paris, combining parts of the Seine paths with some of the city’s most famous landmarks and beautiful places. Start on Pont Neuf, and head to the north side (‘right bank’) of the river. Run by the Louvre into the Jardin des Tuileris, straight into the Place de la Concorde and then along the wide paths of the Champs Elysées, continuing along the famous shopping section, to Charles De Gaulle Etoile/Arc de Triomphe. Take Rue Kleber south, to the Trocadero, and the gardens, with a great view of the Eiffel Tower. Cross the Pont d’Ilena, do a quick little tour around the Tower, and then along the wonderful paths of the Champ de Mars and then the paths through Invalides. The last mile is along the left bank of the river, passing the Musee d’Orsay.
Some of these areas are major sites on their own, so of course it’s possible to do just some sections.
The heart of Paris is graced by wonderful and historic parks. All have dedicated pedestrian paths wide enough for running. There are many options for running one or more of these parks, incorporating other sites and parts of the Seine river paths. Rather than proscribe a particular ‘run’, here’s a bit of info on each of the main parks.
Long: 8.8 miles RT, starting at the Arc de Triomphe. MAP. Short: save two miles by starting at Port Dauphine10k in the Park: follow “Tour de Longeur” from the Port de la Muette entrance
This is the loveliest, shadiest place for running in the heart of Paris. You’ll find hundreds of fellow joggers on a nice evening. There are some 35 miles of trails in the park. It’s hard to proscribe a particular run, but your best bet is to run around Lac Inferieur and Lac Superieur (5k). Then there’s the option to head toward the northwestern part of the park, using any one of a number of paths. On the good maps at all trail intersections, look for the 10k “Tour de Longeur”, most easily accessible from the Port de La Muette entrance. Our route starts at the Arc de Triomphe just for kicks. Easily accessible by Metro. Combine with Parc St. Cloud for an even longer run.
4.76 mile loop. Start: Chateau Vincennes metroGood add-on option: Run there from City Hall (Hotel de Ville). 3.7 miles one-way. MAP
This is the largest park in Paris, about 4 miles east of Notre Dame in the 12th arrondissement. The park was created between 1855 and 1866 by the Emperor Napoleon III. There are beautiful paths for running in this park. Highlights include the medieval Chateau de Vincennes, an arboretum, floral gardens, and numerous other natural and recreational facilities. The best bet is to randomly enjoy the miles of paved and unpaved paths. A tour of the outer perimeter trails is ~4.5 miles. Other options: 1 mile around Chateau de Vincennes; 1.4m around Lac Daumsenil. Or look for the “Circuits Pedestres”, which include 11k and 8k loops. Many more trails can be added. The trails are well signed, with mile markers. 15 minutes by metro. A good option for a longer run is from City Hall, which takes you by Bastille and then on some greenways and good running roads into the park. Do it one way and take the Metro back! Or, take the Promenade Plantée path back to Bastille, from Port Dorée entrance.
2.4 miles O-W. Start: Bastille or Porte de Montempoivre (metro Bel Air). MAPAdd-on options: Bois de Vincennes, Parc des Buttes Chaumont
This is a favorite Paris off-road path. Created out of an abandoned metro line, PlantPé is an elevated, paved linear park that runs 2.4 miles from Bastille in the Eleventh arrondissement to Porte de Montempoivre. You’ll see lots of other runners, and inline skaters. Just beneath the path, along the viaduct, there are shops, markets, and artist studios. There are numerous entrance gates along the way, each with their own opening/closing times. For a longer run, continue from the end of the path into Bois de Vincennes, which is 0.5 miles using Rue Sacrot (look for the Porte Dorée entrance), or mid-way along the Plantée path, from Jaures, head 1/2 mile east to Parc des Buttes Chaumont. Good hills there. Notes: There are signs that say “This place is a space for walking. Jogging is tolerated only to the extent that it doesn’t disturb walkers.”
5km of trails and good hills. Easy access via metro. Also 1/2 mile east of Promenade Plantée, 1/2 mile south of Parc de Villette.
A great park to do some hills. Unveiled at the 1867 World’s Fair, this park is sometimes referred to as the ‘Central Park’ of Paris. About 5km of trails, with the hilliest in the interior. Great to combine with Parc de Villette, or Promenade Plantée.
Short option: 3.2/6.4 miles out & back/RT. Start: Bastille. MAPLong Option: 5.2/10.4 miles out & back/RT. Start: Bastille. MAP
This is another wonderful linear park option from the heart of Paris. It follows the Canal St. Martin, which meanders its way from near the Bastille to Parc de Villette. The towpath is very pretty, with lovely chestnut trees shading some sections. The first section on our map is hard to see because it is below the street. Runners have a few options here: run one-way, 3.2 miles, and then hop on the metro back — multiple stations along the way and at the Parc. Or, it’s 6.4 miles RT. A longer option is to to enjoy some of the paths in Parc de Villette. A more modern, landscaped park, with interesting sites such as the Géode, a 36-diameter sphere, garden of mirrors, the garden of trellises, and the garden of islands, connected by ~2 miles of paths. Then return, for a long 10.4 mile run, or hop the metro.
4.2 miles RT. Start: Esplanade de La Defense metro. MAPAdd-ons: it’s 3k to the Palais de Congrès, which also abuts Bois de Boulongne, and 4k to the Arc de Triomphe.
La Défense is Paris’ version of London’s Canary Wharf/Docklands. It’s a business-centric district of modern office buildings on the edge of town. It started in the 1970s but it is still growing. As with most things Paris, this area has been built on a grand, post-modernist scale. It’s pretty convenient — ~2 miles from the convention center. Running in this area is pretty good: long, wide plazas and pathways with trees, monuments, and places to shop and eat. Start at the Esplanade de Défense or anywhere in that vicinity, and continue along the Allée to the Grand Arch, which is a modern version of the Arc de Triomphe (note it is is a 5k straight shot from ‘Arc to Arche’). Note it’s a bit tricky connecting from the Arche into Nanterre, but a run into Parc André Malraux is worthwhile. There are ~2 miles of trails in here, including a couple of hills! On the return, pass by the “Cloud Towers”, and Rue Hoche leads to a bridge over the freeway and back into the La Defense area. There are good, business-y hotels in La Defense area.
Paris is a huge city. There are runs possible in every arrondissement or suburb. Here, we’ve highlighted some of the best ‘destination’ runs.
6.4 mile loop. Start: City Hall, Versailles. MAPEasily accessible by public transport from Paris. Open 8am-6pm
One of the most significant palaces in the world is also a great running destination. The Versailles Gardens are huge and open to the public, with many wonderful landmarks, including great views of the palace, a section of formal gardens and highly sculpted allées, and then, further westward, bucolic paths going by farms and fields. A great ~10k run is to start at City Hall right in Versailles, head into the Palace grounds, and along the formal gardens to the perimeter of the Grand Trianon, and then on the paths of the perimeter of the Canal and fountains. This is a total 6.4 mile loop. It’s easy to add another couple of miles using some of the more remote paths in the northern section of the park or running along the outer perimeter paths.
5 miles. Start: at park. Metro: St. Cloud, Boulogne. MAP
This beautiful park is a wonderful running option south of the 15th arrondissement, and not far from Bois de Boulogne. It has some of the most beautiful gardens in Europe. There are wonderful allées and paths for running. A good tour can easily add up to 5 miles.
Paris has a great variety of hotels. And even though the metropolitan area is large, anywhere inside the inner beltway (Blvd. Peripherique) will put you within a 1–2 miles of a good running option. It’s 7–8 miles east-west or north-south within the beltway. That said, easy access to the Seine and the major tourist sites, is in the 1st-7th Arrondissements. Arrs. 13–15, and 20 might have more budget friendly accommodation options but are a bit further from some of our best routes. But even if you end up some distance from an “ideal” running location, try to stay near a metro stop, as that will put you within 15–20 minutes of somewhere great for running. If traveling to Paris for business, it’s fine to stay in La Defense/Convention Center area. There’s good running there, and it’s not far from the Arc de Triomphe, and the Bois de Boulogne.
There is a growing number of running specialty stores in Paris:
Passion Running. Locations near La Bastille, Bois de Boulogne, and the outer 15th Arr. Group Runs: Saturday mornings.
Planet Jogging. Great location between convention center and Etoile.
Endurance Shop. Nearly 100 locations in France. In Paris, they have a store at Montparnasse, and at Versailles.
KM42. Near Parc Monceau. Having to do with the Paris Marathon.
Boutique Marathon. Near Parc Monceau and also Bercy.
There are also Nike, Adidas, and New Balance stores within the heart of Paris.
A great resource for running in Paris is Free Paris Running Tours. Luke and his team lead wonderful, free running tours of one of the world’s most beautiful cities.
Paris Running Tour also offers guided runs of Paris
Les Moustiques. Welcomes runners of all levels to train in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. The club meets Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. at the Paul Valéry stadium in the 12th arrondissement.

Paris is home to the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, the Notre Dame and many more iconic landmarks. It is the city of fashion, haute cuisine and lights. As one of the most popular tourist destinations, it exerts an enormous attraction to people all over the globe: in 2023 it received more international visitors than New York, Bangkok or Mecca.
When we think of Paris, we picture a city with grand boulevards, lined with stately buildings, between which little alleyways meander. Here locals chatter on the outdoor terraces of countless bistros and brasseries while enjoying the culinary delights.
This romantic image of the French capital is true only to some extent. It’s not something the majority of the 11 million inhabitants of the Paris metropolitan area experience in their daily lives. Paris has long outgrown its historic core: most of the people who consider themselves Parisains today live in the city’s suburbs: the banlieues.
The Paris within the Périphérique (the ring road which encircles Paris proper) is world-famous. The suburbs which lay outside it remain mysterious places.
In today’s article, I want to shine a light on Paris’s banlieues: their history, their development and their…

How long do you have to be visiting a city before you start to feel like a local? Or, maybe it has more to do with how you spend your days rather than a length of time. When I spent a week in Paris last year with my best friend, her Apple watch clocked us at about 24,000 steps a day. We did all the usual touristy things: Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Sacre Coeur, the Louvre, etc. But I’ve always longed to visit a foreign city and live like a local instead. Getting to know a city on a deeper level is hard to do when you’re in hardcore tourist mode. So, I decided to pack up my laptop to spend a month working remotely in Paris this summer — with the intention to live like une vrai Parisienne, at least for a little while.
One of my biggest pet peeves is looking like a typical American tourist. It can’t be helped most of the time, but there have been trips where I’ve gone out of my way to avoid it. For example, when I traveled to Turkey for 10 days, I arrived with freshly dyed dark-brown hair and a carefully culled suitcase devoid of sneakers or anything made of denim. Apparently, it worked. A few times, locals spoke to me in Turkish, and a few tourists even stopped me to ask for directions.
This time around, I’m not focused on blending in, especially not clothes-wise. That’s impossible in such a fashion-conscious city filled with genetically chic inhabitants. Besides, I need my comfy shoes. Instead, I want to do more ordinary things to fill my days. Yes, there will be sightseeing on my days off, and of course I will be taking beaucoup photos. But when I walk out the front door of my flat in the 5th arrondissement, I want to “have the air of” a local, as the French would put it.
To me, that means heading to a farmers market to buy the week’s fruits and vegetables, going for a morning run along the Seine, reading Le Monde over my morning coffee, watching French TV, going to a movie theater, listening to French pop music on the radio, reading a book in a park, and cooking myself dinner. I thought about bringing my laptop to a cafe and working there for a few hours, but I’m afraid that it would make me look too American. I’m pretty sure Parisians don’t mix work with pleasure.
I’m hoping that mundane tasks like doing laundry will make me feel more like a local and less like a tourist. I’ll have my own washer and dryer in the flat I’m renting. People don’t usually wash their clothes when they’re staying in hotels, at least not the proper way. My husband admits he once washed his clothes in the dishwasher on a business trip! I’m no better. When I was a teenager, I went on a trip to Europe with my high school, and our first stop was Paris. The bathroom in the hotel room I shared with my friends had a toilet and sink (of course). But it also had this weird “bonus sink” that was lower to the ground and had faucets to turn on hot and cold water. My best guess, being only sixteen, was that it was for washing clothes, so that’s what I did. Not long after, I learned what a bidet was and realized in horror that I had washed my underwear and socks where previous hotel guests had washed their, um, dirty derrières.
Another embarrassing laundry faux pas came only about a decade later while on my honeymoon in Germany and Austria. We were in the alpine city of Salzburg, staying in this lovely hotel recommended by Rick Steves, my favorite travel writer and host of a TV travel show on PBS. We even sported Rick Steves’ official backpacks that I had borrowed from a friend so that we could carry our luggage on our backs like seasoned pros. Well, it didn’t take long for me to get blisters from walking with all that extra weight. When we got to the hotel, I was definitely in the mood to treat myself to a luxury. So, when I saw a white plastic bag hanging in our hotel room closet, I decided to use the hotel’s laundry service instead of washing my socks and underwear in the sink. It wasn’t until I got everything back that I realized it was a dry-cleaning service, not laundry. I was both horrified and oddly impressed at how each pair of socks and underwear was carefully pinned to cardboard and artfully wrapped in tissue paper like little Christmas presents.
Ever since that first trip to Europe as a teenager, I yearned to live abroad someday. I had hopes of being a travel writer like Rick Steves or Bill Bryson and wanted to move to Europe. I also wanted to become fluent in Spanish, a language I had studied in school for eight years but never could master. Alas, none of that was meant to be. But as Edith Piaf would croon: Je ne regrette rien. I regret nothing. I’ve had a fulfilling career as a technical writer for almost 20 years now, and I’ve taken some pretty cool trips, though mostly as a tourist.
Very early in my career, I did have some luck getting a travel article published in my hometown newspaper, the Bristol Pilot. I had decided to do a work abroad program right after college and lived in London for six months on a special visa. After two weeks of pounding the pavements, I landed a job as a receptionist for World Imports, an importer of Mexican beers like Corona and Modelo Negra to the U.K. I had always known that my hometown of Bristol, Pa., was named after Bristol, England, so I decided to take a trip there one Saturday and document my experience. The article was titled “Tales of Another Bristol,” or something like that. It was the only travel article I’ve ever had published.
There was no question about feeling like a local during my London days, that’s for sure. I did mundane things every day. For one, my job as a receptionist was pretty boring. Most of the time I just sat there waiting for the phone to ring. Sometimes I would deliver faxes or make coffee for visitors. A lot of my coworkers spoke Spanish, so to kill time I would practice translating letters and have them check it. Commuting to work was another drag. There were times when I would be running late for work (yet again) all sweaty and out of breath from running for the train, with a big knot in my stomach anticipating getting in trouble by the owner, Alphonso, and I would want to just break down and cry. But I would remind myself that at least I was in London, and that seemed to make it all better.
So, this idea for a 30-day mini adventure in Paris is a small step toward fulfilling a lifelong dream of living abroad, though I’m more into learning French these days than Spanish. In fact, I’ll be attending my twice-weekly French class online while I’m there. With the time difference, it won’t start until midnight! Another adjustment will be my work schedule. I plan to start at 2 p.m. so that I can still make scheduled meetings with my East Coast colleagues, which means I’ll be working into the night. But the upside is I’ll have my mornings free. Also, the sun doesn’t set until 10 p.m. in Paris in the summer, making the days feel longer.
Eventually, I plan to document here on Medium how it all went. Will I feel like a local after only 30 days? Will I get asked for directions while lugging home groceries or doing some other ordinary chore? Will I master the European washer and dryer and other foreign appliances without blowing any fuses? One thing is for certain: If I encounter a vintage bidet somewhere, I’ll know exactly what NOT to do.
Until then, follow my stories on Instagram (@pammypez) or Facebook (@pfassett).

Victor Hugo, Marcel Proust, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and many others have captured the essence of Paris in their writing, and numerous poets have used this city as their muse. For artists and creators, Paris is a city of sensations, of layers, of contrasts and defies easy categorisation.
Walking the streets of this city, I felt all the hopes, aspirations and fantasies that are often excluded from my conscious personality in everyday life come alive—the determination never to be disappointed by life, to see only what is beautiful, good and kind.
I had strangers smiling at me and that lively “Bonjourrrr”. I admired Parisians going about their daily lives, running up and down the path beside the Seine. I watched a group of French women having their passionate intellectual debates in a restaurant before going to their yoga class. I watched people wandering through the Sunday flea market in search of the perfect vintage garment. I have admired femininity and the art of true seduction, the very definition of naked couture at a cabaret show, reminiscent of a simpler time when natural beauty was cherished.
For artists who have often felt left out or like they don’t belong because their upbringing or culture doesn’t support the arts or embrace creativity, Paris is a breath of fresh air. Going to a country where the government itself has a history of supporting the arts and culture makes you feel seen and understood.
Sous le ciel de Paris, I was reminded that what I do matters, and for the first time I didn’t feel that my romanticism was being challenged or stifled. I didn’t feel at war with myself.
I felt at peace.

The Best (and Worst) Month to Fly to Paris on a Budget in 2025,https://medium.com/@kwanqi.yt/the-best-and-worst-month-to-fly-to-paris-on-a-budget-in-2025-08e96d23e78f,"Sign up

A Data-Backed Travel Guide
After binge-watching Emily in Paris (no judgment, please), I’ve been dying to stroll along the Seine, bite into a flaky croissant, and soak in the city’s magic — art, love, history, the works. But I’m also a data nerd who loves a good deal, so I wasn’t about to splurge on flights.
I gathered flight prices from Singapore (SIN), London (LHR), and New York (JFK) to Paris (CDG) to study travel patterns from different corners of the world — Asia, Europe, and North America — and find the cheapest month to visit Paris in 2025. What I found surprised me: a secret sweet spot where prices drop, crowds thin, and Paris still sparkles — plus a month so overpriced and packed it made me rethink my plans.
Paris reinvents itself with each season, and timing can make or break your trip — especially if you’re budget-conscious. Here’s the quick rundown:
Timing matters because each season shows a different side of Paris — and impacts your wallet.
November is your golden ticket.
Flights from LHR averaged $125, SIN $350, and JFK $300 — the lowest I found all year. Why? It’s late fall in Paris (6–11°C), meaning fewer tourists clogging up the Louvre or the Marais. My price trend plot confirmed it: November was the cheapest across the board. Sure, it’s chilly — pack a scarf and a jacket — but imagine this: you’re sipping hot chocolate by the Seine, golden leaves falling, and you didn’t break the bank to get there. That’s November in Paris.
If November’s too cold for you, consider September to October. My daily price trend plot showed prices stabilizing during this period — before spiking again in late October. Wonder why the stability? Summer’s rush (think families on school break) fades, and demand drops as kids head back to school. September’s still mild (13–21°C), with fewer crowds and scenic fall vibes — perfect for a bike ride along the Canal Saint-Martin. October cools down (9–16°C) but keeps the charm, with autumn colors popping in the Tuileries Garden. Just watch out for late October — prices start creeping up as holiday travel looms.
Here’s the month I’d dodge like a tourist trap: August. My price trend plot showed a steady climb through the month, peaking near the end. Why the spike? It’s peak summer (16–25°C), and Paris is swarming with tourists soaking up the sun. Plus, many Europeans (including Parisians) take their annual holidays, so the city’s packed with visitors while locals escape to the coast. If you hate crowds (and overpaying), August is a hard pass.
My price trend plot revealed a wild ups and downs from June to July. What gives? June is the tail end of shoulder season — still warm (14–23°C), but demand hasn’t peaked. Come July, summer hits full swing: school holidays kick in, Bastille Day (July 14) draws crowds with its parades and fireworks, and Paris becomes the place to be. More demand, higher prices — it’s simple economics, but it stings.
Here’s the deal: book your 2025 Paris trip for November. You’ll save big, enjoy a quieter city, and still get that Parisian magic (pro tip: pack a scarf — it’s chilly).
Have you visited Paris during an off-season month? Did you find hidden deals, or do you think the summer hype is worth it?

Outline of a talk at the Critical University 15 May 2021
If we go back to March 18th, and look at the famous imagery of the National Guard on their barricades, we’re only seeing one half of the story. This is the French labour movement as it saw itself: orderly, respectable and quite obviously gendered — the men have the guns, flags and uniforms, the women and children stand to the side.
The battalions were rooted in local communities but, as Martin Phillip Johnson shows, there was a lot of crossover — so that a man in one area might actually travel to be with friends in another area’s battalion. Which suggests they were based both on community and workplace.
But March 18th itself, and the subsequent trajectory of the Commune as a revolutionary government, involved a completely different demographic: la canaille, the mob: the shanty-dwelling ultra poor, including migrants from outside Paris, overlapped with the classic bohemia of artists, impoverished law students, registered sex workers, slum children… and nobody took their photos, although they drew them.

On 20th May 2024, our most awaited day was here. It was the first day of our fortnight-long planned package tour of Europe. We covered the following countries- Netherlands, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Italy, Slovenia, Vatican, and Germany for a span of two weeks.
This trip was a result of three months of extensive planning and preparation. There were massive discussions and contradictions within our family on which travel agency should we choose, which itinerary, the budget, VISA appointment, purchasing and much more.
We consulted many relatives, friends, family friends, those who have been on a European trip, and much more. At last, we booked our travel with Soman’s Leisure Tours, Kochi. On 30th April, we had our VISA appointment.
On the 10th we had an online meeting with the tour company explaining the guidelines for the trip. They instructed us about currency, international SIM and much more.
18th, Saturday was the day when we started to put together things. Despite that, we could not have successful progress on that. On the 19th we had to go to our ancestral place hence, it was indeed a tight…

Yayyyy!! Its summer, its vacation time.
This Year we are planning to Visit Paris. ( I’ve already been to Paris though )
This would be the 1st time my wife / kid and my in-laws would visit Paris. I quickly wanted to share with you our 3 day Itenerary.
Paris is a city that is full of history, art, culture, and great food (especially if you are into French cuisine). There is no one perfect itinerary for visiting Paris, but here is a suggested 3-day itinerary that will help you get a taste of the best that the capital of France has to offer:
Day 1:
Day 2:
Day 3:
This itinerary will give you a taste of the best (or the most famous) that Paris has to offer, but there is so much more to see and do in this incredible city.
If you have more time, be sure to explore the lesser-known neighborhoods and attractions. Personally, I like the Catacombs, the Père Lachaise Cemetery (graves of Jim Morrison or Chopin, but also a nice walking area) or just visiting Sunday morning local markets…
Plenty to see and do.
If you had something to take away, add a clap / respond / highlight / follow me and subscribe to get emails as soon as I publish. We all go further when we help each other!”
Cheers — KS !!

I think the way French people say, “Bonjour!” is sensuous. Just two syllables. Or two musical notes, rather.
Shopkeepers, waitstaff, and bartenders all seem to sing when they greet me with “Bonjour!” or “Bonjour, monsieur!”
Nothing about me asks to be serenaded. I’m an older American male of Chinese ethnicity, not immediately charismatic, nor sharply dressed, nor classically good-looking, nor anything. On my better days, I could perhaps pass for an expatriate, but more often, I probably come off as a seasoned tourist, which, at least, is accurate.
Everyone gets this greeting, not just me. But alas, not everyone responds in a way that matches the greeter’s sensuality. They should. We could all use a bit more sensuality in our lives, no matter how small.
I wish to blend in, to “live like a local” as many travelers like to say. So, whenever I’m greeted, I feel the need to respond in kind. Thus, I reply, “Bonjour!” in the best French I can muster, which causes me to mimic that same songlike quality. “Bonjour!” I feel better just saying, er, singing it.
For example, I found myself singing at 9:15 am as I entered La Crémaillère 1900 in Montmartre on a chilly, misty April morning. Still sleepy, and before my morning coffee.
Singing “Bonjour!” in response to the server uplifts me. Sure, it’s only two notes, but it’s two more notes than I sing when I enter a café near my home in New York City.
By the way, I wrote my first draft of this story in this café, and all the photos in this article are of this establishment.
If you must ask, I had the “Pain perdu au caramel beurre salé” or “Salted butter caramel French toast.” Yes, it was as sensuously decadent as that reads.
Some say that “Paris est un village,” and I can see why. Few other large cities I’ve experienced greet me like I’m in a small town, but people here do this naturally.
I found out later that all of French society conspires to do this, not just Parisians. French children are consistently taught to say “bonjour” and “au revoir” to their peers and adults. Some say it’s a way to acknowledge another’s humanity.¹
I live in New York City, where we value efficiency. We can’t be bothered with fussy things like greetings, especially with strangers. Often just a direct, “Do you have the time?” or “I’d like a matcha oat latte, please!”
But is it really that fussy? It’s not like I’m being asked to say, “Good day to you, madame. You look quite well today.” Saying “hello” is only two syllables, just like in French!
I’m resolved to acknowledge my fellow New Yorkers’ humanity when I get home. I will sing “Hello!” to all of them, even if things get awkward. Maybe I’ll get a side job at a café or a Lululemon shop. Just for the practice.
Back in Paris, at bustling, understaffed restaurants, harried servers move quickly and efficiently. They don’t smile. They acknowledge me just long enough to indicate, yes, take any available seat. Maybe I’ll get a menu soon, maybe not.
But I always get a tonally cheerful “Bonjour!” paired with firm, if fleeting, eye contact.
The Middle Eastern immigrants working the kebab stalls greet me with a lilting “Bonjour!” The Chinese housekeeping staff at my hotel: “Bonjour!” Service workers who don’t even seem happy with their jobs, at least at that moment: “Bonjour!”
It’s as if those weary service workers are saying, “I’m unhappy right now, but I’m not taking it out on strangers. And so, I will sing because singing is good for my soul. Even if it’s just two notes.”
And if singing one’s troubles is good for one’s soul, does that mean complaining in French is more therapeutic than complaining in English? I’ve heard people complain in French many times, and it’s the cutest thing ever. I feel cathartic just listening to them, and I don’t even know what they’re saying most of the time!
French certainly sounds better than the flatter tones of my American English. In my home country, I hear the French language’s relative musicality exert its influence.
Does it sound more meaningful to say you’re a “hustler” or an “entrepreneur”? (Bonus: Say “entrepreneur” in proper French, with a crooked half-smile and a gleam in your eye for a self-effacing, satirical effect.)
What feels better to say after you emotionally process a major setback? “That’s life!” versus “C’est la vie!”
If you and your partner want to invite a prospective new lover to your bedroom, would you coquettishly propose a “threesome” or a “ménage à trois”?
I’m not an enraptured newbie à la Emily in Paris. This is my seventh time in Paris. I’ve been to other parts of France. I’m actually a sometimes-jaded traveler. I’ve studied French on and off for years.
While I’ve always loved French culture and people, after all these visits, I’m finally noticing and loving the soulful quality I hear in the French language.
That’s all I have about French greetings. Though, we haven’t discussed French farewells, which I find similarly lyrical. I guess you’ll just have to use your imagination when I say (sing):
Au revoir! Bonne journée!
As mentioned, all photos in this article were shot inside this café:
La Crémaillère 1900 (Yelp, Google Maps)

On November 23rd we embarked on our final trip of 2024 — a long weekend to Paris, France.
It was 5.30 am when we arrived at the train station, wishing that our train would hurry up and whisk us away from the cold, dark, windy platform.
From home to London and from London onto the Eurostar which took us into the centre of Paris.
A short Metro journey later and we were in Montmartre, where we were staying for our 3-night trip.
I couldn’t quite believe that the Basilica was just around the corner from our hotel, but there it was large and splendid in the afternoon sunshine.
Taking the funicular up the steep hill we arrived to amazing views across the Paris skyline. I took the opening photo above from the steps of the Basilica, you can just see the Eiffel Tower in the distance.
Behind the Basilica are lots of ‘olde worlde’ little cobbled streets, so we took a wander. It was a lovely walk through the older parts of Montmartre, but…

There’s an eclectic, egalitarian art gallery hiding in plain sight in Le Marais district in Paris. Its art pieces coexist with the chic boutiques and charming restaurants this area is known for.
Throughout these winding, intimate medieval streets, perched on walls above eye level (or below, sometimes) are street art pieces.
I love finding them amongst the teeming throngs of tourists. So many tourists. But who am I to hate on them? I’m a tourist myself, and I love Le Marais, just like them.
Several years ago, I did a street art tour of this neighborhood. The tour guide told me that residents here tended to be more tolerant of graffiti and street art. Artists, Bohemians, gays/lesbians, and other groups have at times occupied this area since the late 20th century.
I went back this year.
Just like years ago, it did not disappoint.
All photos in this article were taken by me in Le Marais during my April 2025 trip — except for this one below from December 2017, where I actually caught a street artist in the act!!
I’ve done my best to attribute the artworks that I know.
Back to this year.
I discovered this cute piece below.
I wondered if the raccoon stencil was part of the original piece or if another artist added it later. Did the original artist get annoyed or grudgingly accept it?
You had to walk down a nondescript residential street to find this one:
I don’t know why these artists are into vintage video game characters, but I find them cute.
On the left below is Super Mario by Invader (Official website, Instagram). That famous artist of those Space Invaders video game characters rendered as tile art throughout Paris and beyond.
Did you know there’s a FlashInvaders app that lets you “collect” sightings of Invader’s works? It’s totally a thing.
Below is more street art. I love the various forms and mediums this art can take.
Some pieces were stunningly intricate, as shown below. For pieces that clearly require so much effort, I sometimes wonder if artists seek permission from the building owners first or hope that the virtuosity of the piece earns enough respect to spare its destruction.
Le Marais is already delightful with its shopping, food, and vibes. You would not be faulted for enjoying only these things.
But there’s a playful, subversive layer if you slow down and look closely enough.
Next time you’re here, let your gaze wander more.
Or take a detour down that nondescript alley.
You may be rewarded with some artistic surprises!

Artful storytelling helping inspire women to learn and grow

--
Listen
Share
I love the “City of Stars” music from the recent Oscar-nominated movie, La La Land. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling tenderly whisper their dreams and hopes to the stars, praying for a city of lights filled with love and happiness.
When I hear this song my heart escapes to a magical place where my dreams are admittedly sentimental and gooey. For me, my city of lights shines brightly in Paris.
Every time I’m in Paris I succumb to its winding streets and famous arrondissements. While I have yet to go beyond the city, venturing into Versailles and Fontainebleau, who can blame me? Paris if filled with an endless selection of bottomless bread baskets, silky cheeses and overflowing red wine on almost every Parisian corner. These culinary delights stimulate my blissful escape into the fascinating world of Parisian stories, stretching my imagination across time and well beyond the city’s center at Notre Dame.
Historical French women call out to me like Joan of Arc, from her gable perch on the Sacré Cœur Basilica, and Josephine Bonaparte, as I walk the cobblestone streets in front of Notre Dame. Paris is alive thousands of monuments to women, whose contributions have changed history and opportunities for other women.
In Montmartre, fifteenth century Joan of Arc is one of my favorite musings. She sits to the left of a triumphant King Louis IX. Joan is best remembered for her role in preserving France’s religious faith and national unity. During the Hundred Years War when the English occupied parts of France and threatened its sovereignty, Joan claimed to hear God’s voice telling her to lead the embattled crown prince Charles VII to victory at Orléans.
Joan of Arc’s victorious charge and horrific death as a heretic burned at the stake sealed her fate as one of France’s most cherished saints. But what if Joan had ignored her dreams or had been too afraid to take up the sword, especially since women leading in war front was unheard of at this time?
Joan’s mystic legacy as a great leader and savior of the church is honored in thousands of statues throughout Paris, and to this day she continues to be a subject of great scholarly fascination.
More personally, the golden image of Joan riding on a horse into battle inspires me to feel like anything is possible in life, if you stay true to your beliefs and convictions amidst doubt and controversy.
Of all the fascinating French women of Paris, I could not write their stories without including the most famous one living in the Louvre museum.
Before you say the Mona Lisa shouldn’t be included because she isn’t technically French born, and is only an Italian subject of painter Leonardo Da Vinci’s, hear me out.
I include the Mona Lisa among the most inspiring and transformative French women for two reasons: her portrait was commissioned by the King of France in 1530 and, most importantly, she is the most visited, studied, and best known work of art in the world whose place in Paris is solidified. Essentially, there are no plans for the Mona Lisa to emigrate anytime soon.
Her resting place in the Louvre is an interesting one, after her picture first hung in the gallery of King Francois I at Fontainebleau. Napoleon Bonaparte moved her to his bedroom wall in his Tuileries apartment in 1800 before she took official residence in the Louvre four years later. The Mona Lisa has continued to live in Paris well over 200 years now, and my fixation with her place there is shared with the world.
No doubt her mysterious smile or what the Italians call, sfumato (meaning blurry, ambitious and up to the imagination) is a perfect reflection of the mysterious allure that French women exude. It is an allure that can’t be defined, any more than Nat King Cole tried in his hit song about Mona Lisa’s smile or Columbia Pictures’ attempt to classify her in the 2003 movie, Mona Lisa Smile.
The potential for women to reach new heights and to dream beyond traditional roles is enough to hold me captive. Mona Lisa reminds us of the power of the imagination, even for any doubters who know that Da Vinci predicted many future inventions from flying machines to water inventions.
Mona Lisa is more than a 16th century painting of Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo. Her stature goes far beyond the millions of people who have flocked to see her. She embodies that powerful combination of strength, mystery, creativity and individualism in French women that inspires me to be even more than I already am.
French history is filled with further examples of complex female figures, the last which must be included to understand revolutionary France. During the French Reign of Terror in 1793, Josephine Tascher de La Pagerie was married to a prominent Viscount named Alexandre de Beauharnais. Alexandre was executed by guillotine for being an aristocratic sympathizer but his wife Josephine was saved from the same fate thanks to her quick intellect.
Parisian women still recount Josephine’s ingenious escape. Josephine walked up the steps of the platform to meet her death but fainted in front of a huge crowd gathered at Notre Dame. Claiming she was with child, she knew the Catholic laws protected the execution of an innocent child so her life would be spared. Able to wait out the political unrest in jail Josephine was released when the final coup d’état ended.
Josephine would reappear on these same steps of Notre Dame to be crowned Empress years later when she married Napoleon Bonaparte. After her prison release she became a popular leader in Paris society and caught the fancy of Napoleon, a young rising officer in the army. She used her position to advance his political fortune, and when they married in a civil ceremony Josephine insisted on a second ceremony at Notre Dame after his coronation as Emperor on December 1, 1804.
During their reign, Josephine fought for social and political reforms and joined a movement of women called the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, whose demands included equal rights for women and economic reforms in Paris. Participating in a march that included over seven thousand armed women, Josephine took to the streets and protested at the Hotel de Ville and later Versailles.
Josephine secured her title as Empress with Napoleon even after he divorced her because she could not produce an heir. Despite her new status, she remained politically astute and helped assuage the marriage of her daughter, Hortense, to Napoleon’s brother Louis, and her son Eugene’s marriage to the daughter of the King of Bavaria.
When you consider Josephine’s historical legacy, her ancestry of five dynasties still reigns in Northern Europe, in the ruling families of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, and in Luxembourg. In fact, she is even connected to Princess Diana and her son William, who will become the next King of England. How’s that for a city of lights and an Empress of all Empires?
Parisian women have changed the course of history in France and throughout the world. The new reign of terror attacks are not enough to dampen my appetite for Paris, as I stand in solidarity with them. The French commitment to helping America in its struggle for independence lives on in our Lady Liberty statue, a gift from the French designed by Auguste Bartholdi.
As she clutches the Declaration of Independence and steps out of the British chains that lay at her feet, I know France will always have a special place in my heart. This power is underscored by its women and captured in a diary entry by Napoleon to his future wife, Josephine. In it, he writes to her saying,
“I awake filled with you. Your portrait and yesterday’s intoxicating evening left no repose for my senses. Gentle, incomparable Josephine, what a strange effect you have on my heart!”

“When you make a decision as a mayor, you immediately see positive and negative effects.” says Ms Anne Hidalgo, Mayor Paris
Since becoming the first female Mayor of Paris in 2014, Anne Hidalgo has championed an ambitious vision to make the French capital a global leader in sustainability and urban environmental innovation. Her policies, rooted in combating climate change and enhancing the quality of life for Parisians, have reshaped the city’s landscape, reduced its ecological footprint, and set a benchmark for cities worldwide. Hidalgo’s work reflects a commitment to nature, social equity, and a forward-thinking approach to urban living, earning her international acclaim, including a spot on TIME’s 2024 TIME100 Climate list. This article explores her transformative efforts to foster a greener Paris and secure a better future for its residents.
A Vision for a Greener Paris
Hidalgo’s tenure has been defined by bold environmental policies aimed at reducing pollution, prioritizing sustainable mobility, and reintegrating nature into urban spaces. Her overarching goal is to make Paris a “15-minute city,” where essential services—shops, schools, workplaces, and green spaces—are accessible within a short walk or bike ride. This concept, championed by Hidalgo and urban planner Carlos Moreno, seeks to reduce car dependency, enhance community living, and mitigate climate impacts.
Her initiatives reflect a holistic approach to urban planning, balancing ecological resilience with social inclusion.
Revolutionizing Urban Mobility
One of Hidalgo’s most transformative achievements has been her push to reduce car dominance in Paris, a city historically shaped by automotive culture. Since 2014, her administration has added over 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) of bike lanes, making cycling a viable and safe option for commuters. The “Plan Vélo” initiative has expanded cycling infrastructure, with dedicated lanes and bike-sharing schemes like Vélib’ becoming integral to Parisian life. Posts on X highlight the scale of this transformation, noting that Paris has built “+800km new bike paths” and reduced car traffic by 40% under Hidalgo’s leadership.
Hidalgo has also pedestrianized key areas, transforming the Seine riverbanks into car-free zones reserved for walkers and cyclists. The “Paris Respire” (Paris Breathes) initiative bans traffic in certain areas on Sundays and holidays, encouraging residents to reclaim public spaces. Major roads, including stretches along the Seine and iconic plazas like Bastille and Nation, have been redesigned to prioritize pedestrians and public transport. These efforts have led to a 40% drop in air pollution since 2014, significantly improving environmental health.
To further deter car use, Hidalgo introduced policies targeting high-polluting vehicles. Diesel vehicles have been banned from Paris by 2024, with all fossil fuel vehicles phased out by 2030. A parking tax on gas-guzzling SUVs and mandatory emissions stickers for cars entering the city reinforces these measures. These policies not only reduce emissions but also incentivize cleaner transport alternatives, aligning with Paris’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.
Greening the Urban Landscape
Hidalgo’s commitment to nature is evident in her ambitious tree-planting and urban greening programs. Since taking office, Paris has planted over 200,000 trees, with a pledge to add 170,000 more by 2026. Urban forests are being created near landmarks like the Hôtel de Ville, Gare de Lyon, and Opéra Garnier, with plans to cover 50% of the city with planted areas by 2030. A notable project is the transformation of the area from the Trocadéro to the Eiffel Tower into a 56-hectares wooded park, set to become a “green lung” for the city.
In 2022, Hidalgo announced plans for a 3.5-hectare urban forest in the 20th arrondissement, planting over 2,000 trees to combat heatwaves and enhance biodiversity. Her administration has also relaxed building codes to encourage residents to plant trees in their neighborhoods, fostering community-driven greening. These efforts address urban heat island effects, with Paris preparing for projected heatwaves exceeding 50°C (120°F) in coming decades.
Hidalgo’s vision extends to iconic landmarks. The Champs-Élysées, one of the world’s most famous avenues, is being reimagined as a “fantastic garden” by 2030, with wider sidewalks, more trees, and reduced car lanes. These projects not only enhance Paris’s aesthetic appeal but also improve air quality and urban resilience.
Making the Seine Swimmable
A hallmark of Hidalgo’s environmental legacy is her commitment to cleaning the Seine River, a symbolic and practical endeavor. Decades of pollution rendered the Seine unsafe for swimming, but Hidalgo promised to make it swimmable by the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Her administration invested heavily in wastewater treatment and stormwater management, resulting in a cleaner river. In July 2024, Hidalgo herself swam in the Seine to demonstrate its safety, a highly publicized moment that underscores her commitment to environmental progress.
The Olympics provided a platform to showcase sustainable urban practices. Temporary venues minimized new construction, single-use plastics were restricted, and equipment was redistributed for reuse. These efforts halved emissions compared to the 2012 London Olympics, aligning with Paris’s carbon-neutral ambitions.
Global Leadership in Climate Action
Hidalgo’s influence extends beyond Paris through her roles in global climate networks. As chair of C40 Cities from 2016 to 2019, she advocated for urban climate leadership, emphasizing the role of cities in meeting Paris Agreement goals. In 2023, she was appointed a Global Ambassador for the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy, where she pushes for city-level climate financing and ambitious emissions targets. Her work with figures like Michael Bloomberg and other mayors has fostered international collaboration on green policies.
Hidalgo’s leadership during the 2015 COP21 summit, where the Paris Agreement was adopted, cemented her reputation as a climate advocate. She co-hosted the Climate Summit for Local Leaders, empowering cities to set bold emissions targets. Her global advocacy underscores her belief that local actions drive systemic change, a principle reflected in Paris’s recognition with a UN Climate Action Award at COP26.
Visionary Leader
Ms Hidalgo argues that her policies, though polarizing, are necessary to address the climate crisis, a stance echoed by supporters like the former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who called her a “visionary leader.”
A Legacy for the Future
Her decade-long tenure has left an indelible mark on Paris, transforming it into a model of sustainable urban living. From reducing emissions by 25% between 2004 and 2018 to creating 45 kilometers of new parks and 180 car-free “school streets,” Hidalgo’s policies have prioritised nature and human-centric urban design.
Her work has inspired cities globally, proving that bold local action can address planetary challenges. As Paris prepares for a future of climate resilience, Hidalgo’s legacy—bike-filled streets, verdant parks, and a swimmable Seine—stands as a testament to her unwavering commitment to nature and a better future. In her words, “We have to dare, because tomorrow it will be too late.
Regards and a respectful salute to this great Climate Leader and Citizen Of Mother Earth, Ms Anne Hidalgo. It is because of the climate action by world citizens and leaders like you, life on Earth is safe for all living beings.

Before I moved to France, I used to think that French people were arrogant about their food.
Now that I’ve lived here for almost four years, I ‘now’ think that French people are very arrogant about their food.
It’s not that people here aren’t open to other cuisines. Heck, they seem to rate Italian and Japanese food pretty highly.
And it’s not that people from other countries don’t hold supremacist views of their own — at least as far as food is concerned.
But when it comes to questions about culinary sophistication, French people, by and large, take it as self-evident that French food is in a league of its own.
In a country where everything is subject to debate, questions as to French food’s superiority remain, ironically, off the table.
I’m painting in broad strokes, of course; not everyone thinks this way. But given how many times I’ve been privy to French people talking merde about other cuisines, I feel pretty confident about making this claim.
Make no mistake — I love France and the French people. It’s just that French arrogance about food is a tad annoying.

Since learning that the Louvre is undoubtedly the biggest art museum in the world, I have always been keen to visit this famous sight. My partner and I are both artists, and he wanted to see the Louvre, too. The only problem was that neither of us had any desire to visit Paris, and in fact, we were both a bit intimidated by it.
I can’t say exactly why this was. Maybe it was purely the fact that Paris is the most visited city in the world, and we tend to try to stay away from tourist traps as much as possible. Maybe it was because we heard that Parisians hate foreigners who don’t speak French.
It also might be because we heard that Paris is one of the pickpocket capitals of the world. And, oh yeah, we had heard that people were rude and unwelcoming.
Whatever the reasons were, they are long lost in my memory now because I can firmly say that Paris was not one of the stereotypes we had heard, and both of us were pleasantly surprised by the city and its residents.
I’ve said it before, and I will say it again: traveling to a place and experiencing it yourself is the only way to truly understand it. Trying to decide if…

Prior to parenthood, I lived in Paris, married a Frenchman, and enjoyed la bonne vie in our 12th arrondissement neighborhood between the Bastille and the Gare De Lyon. I buffed up my French, eked out a living writing and leading walking tours, and frittered away many a glorious day in open-air markets, museums, and cafes. Then came a move to America after several years in France, and before I knew it, ten years had passed without a trip back to my favorite city. I decided that the time had come to rediscover Paris — and that my young daughter would make a perfect traveling companion. Not that Camille would be inclined to spend hours admiring Picassos or sampling French cuisine. Like many kids, she pooh-poohs art museums and “weird” food. Rather, her raison d’etre in Paris was to rocket to the top of the Eiffel Tower. So, with that in mind, we kissed Dad goodbye, reiterated cat-care instructions, and set out to spend two weeks in France.
My mission when traveling long distances with my daughter is to plan activities that she will look forward to, then have a backup in case Plan A unravels. During our first days in Paris, we stuck close to our flat in the 2nd arrondissement and saved exuberant excursions for the mornings, when we had more stamina. We began with a 10-minute walk to the Centre Georges Pompidou, also known as Beaubourg.
“Pompidou! Is there really someone named Pompidou?” giggled Camille, gaping at one of the three most widely visited cultural site in the France.
“Of course,” I replied. “Pompidou was a French president who liked modern art.”
“Is that modern art?” she gasped, staring at the tangle of pipes and tubes looming above our heads.
People flock to Beaubourg for various reasons–the mishmash of modern architecture, the dance and theatrical spaces, the cavernous modern art museum on the fourth floor–but foremost, it is a fine family venue. Admission is free for kids, and there is plenty of room to move around, with a stew of mimes, musicians, jugglers, and portrait artists to entertain everyone standing in line. Our favorite part of the visit, though, was the panoramic view from Pompidou’s glass escalator.
“There it is, Mom,” shouted Camille, spotting the Eiffel Tower.
“And over there is Notre Dame and Quasimodo’s bell tower,” I pointed out as I thought about lunch. Because of the time change, Camille and I always seemed to be hungry. Outside, we grabbed two seats at one of the creperies surrounding the Fontaine Stravinsky, which boasts an array of whimsical figures that spiral and spit water in the air.
Feeling very French, I ordered a salmon crepe for me and a sugar one for Camille.
“What’s that?” cried my daughter, glaring at the thin, speckled brown pancake being placed in front of her. “It’s not like the crepes we eat at home!”
“It’s a French buckwheat crepe from Brittany,” I explained.
“I don’t like it, Mom. It looks strange.”
In a city where food is art, eating would become our biggest challenge. A litany of complaints accompanied each meal: The cheese smelled like bad breath, the mustard was the wrong shade of yellow, and the crème fraÎche wasn’t real whipped cream.
“Eat,” I implored, sounding like my mother. “There is no better food on the planet than here.”
After the crepe meltdown, we agreed on a culinary compromise, starting with croissants and cocoa for breakfast. Two blocks from our flat, we hit the croissant jackpot on rue Montorgueil. This cobblestone lane is a quintessential slice of French life. Vendors proudly hawk pretty produce from wooden carts as Frenchmen, heads buried behind Le Monde, sip thimble-size cups of coffee at sidewalk cafes. The bonus on the block, though, is La Pâtissier Stohrer, the oldest family bakery in Paris, boasting crusty croissants that are considered by many the best in the city.
Lines! If the Guinness Book of Long Lines existed, the Eiffel Tour would top the chart. Rain or shine, there’s always a huge crowd winding around the tower.
“Achh,” I groaned the afternoon we visited, calculating the four-hour wait.
“Forget the elevator, Mom,” said Camille. “Let’s climb to the top. It’s a shorter line.”
It certainly was: Forty-five minutes later, we were on our way up the mighty monument. “Ooh la la, look at Paris!” I exclaimed as we arrived at the tower’s second tier, mercifully the maximum for climbers. Feeling giddy, we took turns taking pictures in every direction.
The next day, we set out to find what my hometown newspaper calls “the best crepes in Paris.” On rue Cler in the 7th arrondissement, we joined a gaggle of crepe aficionados and watched a monsieur drop dollops of ivory batter onto a grill. Thirty seconds later, he flipped the bubbling batter and slathered it with chocolate. “Now these are real crepes,” said Camille, licking her fingers.
To get around, we purchased a Paris Visite card for unlimited bus and metro travel. The metro sprints across Paris as quickly as one can take a shower, but with a drawback: It’s underground, passing below all the sights we came to Paris to see. So, we reserved the metro for night outings or when we were in a hurry and otherwise crisscrossed Paris on city buses.
In the five years I lived in the city, I managed to avoid the Bateaux Mouches, a one-hour boat excursion that glides through the Seine with an invisible guide who booms out information about historical sights over a loudspeaker. Camille couldn’t wait to board the boat with the rest of the romantics and tourists. Afterward, we agreed it’s the fastest and coolest way to see Paris.
Eight is a grand age for kids to discover the world. They’re not tied to a parent’s hip, and they make friends easily. They’re curious and energetic, and anything new is still cool. But that doesn’t mean every day is hunky dory, even in Paris. One big challenge I faced in traveling solo with my daughter was finding moments when we could each relax in our own way. After a week on the go, tempers frayed. I reigned in the sightseeing and changed tactics, letting Camille sleep late while I savored coffee on the balcony. We discovered small playgrounds filled with children. Ultimately, I indulged my daughter in some of my favorite French frivolities.
Our feet were first on the list. Finding the perfect pair of red tennis shoes on the rue de Rivoli swallowed a chunk of one day, so afterward we skipped lunch and ordered two banana splits in the first cafe we spied along the Seine. Our most exciting moments were similarly unexpected and often free: puppeteers and musicians performing on stone bridges, skateboard competitions near monuments, and watching the Eiffel Tower light up the night like a trillion twinkling stars. One afternoon, we peeked into the pyramid at the Louvre, made a wish, picnicked in the Jardin des Tuileries, rode the Ferris wheel there three times, and conked out by 9 p.m.
We reserved one day for a country outing and chose Monet’s gardens in Giverny, arriving before the crowds on an early train. We loved the lemon-colored lilies cloaking the ponds, the family photos inside Monet’s house, and the tiny tearoom in town.
Suddenly, our days in Paris were dwindling. Sitting along the Seine savoring mango ice cream cones, we mapped out our last adventure: the five-story museum of science and technology at La Villette, which houses a planetarium, greenhouse, submarine, Géode, and more hands-on treasures than we could possibly experience in a day. The fluorescent anatomy section, lighting up the circulatory system, was my favorite. Camille preferred broadcasting a weather report from the museum’s television studio. I found the old-fashioned waterwheel illustrating the relationship between energy and water clever, and Camille gave the greenhouse rave reviews.
On our last night in France, we donned snazzy duds and our new shoes, took the metro to the Left Bank, and devoured a pizza in an outdoor restaurant on Boulevard Saint Germain. We topped off the evening with dessert at Deux Magots, the famous cafe where Simone de Beauvoir and Sartre often sat. It was here that Camille made her confession: “I love Paris, Mom, and I’d love to come with you again. There’s just one problem said my bilingual daughter : I don’t think anyone here understands you, because you speak really bad French!”
“You’re kidding!” I said in my best French. C’est pas vrai!

A few years ago, sometime in late 2022, I moved to France. Paris, to be exact.
I had just been accepted into the American University of Paris. The pandemic was winding down finally, the world was opening up and I decided that I wanted to take a leap of faith and move abroad for a few years.
Like a lot of young Americans, I was deeply convinced that life in Europe — France, to be exact — was going to be a better experience for me than back home. Looking back now I can see my naïvety from a mile away but, to be fair, I had been raised on years of positive, effusive press which often overlooks the dark side of living in Europe, the less-than-ideal reality of France, and my own family members’ longing(s) to escape the United States.
My first year or so in Paris were great, and fun. It was admittedly nice to be outside my comfort zone, in a place I wasn’t really all that familiar with, in a city I had only ever vacationed in. But as I began to “settle” into the city, I felt this lingering sense of discomfort start crawling over me. My first Parisian apartment, in the 7th, so close to the Eiffel Tower I could practically see it from my window, started to feel like an isolating prison. I felt frustrated, depressed, and mind-numbingly bored, but I wasn’t entirely sure if it was just stress from my studies or something else coming up to the surface. I think in many ways I was afraid to acknowledge the truth.
Then my mother died unexpectedly from cancer in the spring of 2024 and my life changed overnight. Home in the States for a few months dealing with her affairs, I had a lot of time to think about my life so far and whether or not I was truly following the right path.
The answer to that was a very resounding NO.
So, I made the painful but necessary decision to move back home, back to the United States, back where I really belong.
France was an okay experience, but it was not really all that people crack it up to be. There was only so much of France and Europe I think one can take before you eventually want to melt into a puddle, cease existing. I tried so hard to “fit into” a culture that would never accept me, never see me for who I really was, that inevitably I was beginning to crack and fall apart. And I tried, very hard, even after my mom died to make it work, but one day I woke up and realized I couldn’t do it anymore. I had to leave, go home, and put my life back together correctly.
Paris is beautiful, yes, but its beauty is, I came to realize, a kind of stifling and suffocating, pretentious, superficiality. When you first move here, it’s glorious to see old Haussmanian apartments towering above you, all in various shades of black and gray, especially when coming from American suburbia. But eventually, you start to notice the decay and depressive energy emanating from these blocks of grubby cement and stone — you see greenish mildew oozing from cracks in buildings, French doors moldering in the corners, rust chewing away at the fancy black banisters. Walking along the wide boulevards is both a dream and a nightmare, because the moment you turn down a corner you inevitably spend the majority of your time hopscotching over poopy pies (most canine but not all), puddles of fresh stinking ochre urine, and other nasty icky things like discarded underwear and who knows what else.
The food here eventually began to drive me crazy. Repetitive, bland, and boring, I began to crave, desperately, a plate of sizzling hot Thai stir fry with basil and chilis and onions and garlic. Or a delicious juicy burger with beef that tastes sweetly of grass and sunshine and not sweat and ammonia, melting in your mouth as opposed to becoming a chewy, grainy mess between your teeth. I missed the variety of produce and snacks at my local Albertsons grocery store, apples like jewels and luscious greens just beckoning to be chopped into stew, being able to make pretty much any dish I could possible think of without having to run around half of Paris to find a tiny bit of garam masala. And don’t even get me started on things like pickles. What do the French have against salty, crunchy, vinegary pickles? I hate those little petite cornichons with their mushy texture and sickly sweet aroma. Of course I could make them, as my grandmother showed me how well enough, but in my middling Parisian kitchen, it was hard to find space to fit a jar of cucumbers, mellowing away in their salted brine, amongst all the other shit I inevitably accumulated. It’s not a crime to want for convenience or simplicity; sometimes, all I wanted was to come home after a long day of classes, papers, and exams to a simple and delicious meal without feeling like I was trapped between McDonald’s and pasta in my choices.
And every time I left Paris for more than a month, I would come back feeling as though the city somehow became a little worse off than before. A little poorer, darker, more negative, less appealing. I think Parisians would like to imagine themselves a living in a bustling metropolis, à la New York, which I find laughable having recently been in NYC myself. Paris is nothing like New York, or London, or even Tokyo or Shanghai or Los Angeles. Even fucking Toronto is more interesting than Paris.
Paris is, at best, a glorified village — it has all the feelings of one, too. Twee and pretentious and conservative in all the wrong ways, clinging to traditions that no one cares about, turning its nose up at innovation and change as though its a crime to experiment and be creative. I found it ironic that in New York, I felt as though I could breathe. Not necessarily because the air was better, but simply because I felt like I could just be myself. No stares as I went about my day alone as apparently, being a single woman without a man or a friend in tow is somehow scandalous (who knew). No funny looks when wearing something other than the usual scarf + nappy old coat combo (the horror). Not having to glower at people over my shoulder as they clip my heels walking at super-sonic speeds down narrow and uneven streets, all to inevitably turn into a smoke shop or some coffeehouse to stand around and do nothing. Not feeling as though I need to explain, or justify my existence to anyone, or anything.
Plus, I’ve had some pretty hair-raising experiences in regards to crime and general grubby, scummy behavior that have made simple things like getting a taxi or even walking down the street more anxiety inducing than I think they need be. Of course we should always practice vigilance wherever we go, but I think when it gets to point you always feel a kind of simmering nervousness about innocent people walking behind you or second-guessing whether or not your taxi driver might pull a fast one on you, something is obviously wrong. Tourists and locals laugh off the crime (and its increase) as though it was funny and quirky but deep down, again, everyone knows it’s not a good sign. Not just now but of the state of things to come.
I haven’t even touched on the racism, the prejudices you inevitably run into, the rampant xenophobia, particularly towards Americans, which begins to weigh on your psyche. As expats/immigrants, we’re given a litany of things (literally! my university would often send lists out) we can’t do in Paris, or else. You try your very best to “fit in” and assimilate, but eventually it gets to the point where you’re just dimming your light to satisfy someone else’s mediocrity, and it actually made me angry a little. Why does everyone need to conform, go along with the crowd, not stand out, not be an individual? Have an opinion that isn’t like Jacques or Emilie’s, which also happens to be the same opinion of nearly every other person you meet? Why is it a crime to smile widely, laugh heartily, or feel passionately? I am not interested in living life in muted sepia tones all day every day, sorry! And trying to make connections with other expats was a nightmare in and of itself: I could never accept the habitual mistreatment, backhanded comments, two faced behavior, cattiness, and other bull that many American expats often put up with just to be accepted by Parisians and, in general, the French and many other Europeans. After about the second time of some random nobody making incredibly offensive and often racist personal digs at me, my intelligence, or my appearance, I had to call it quits.
I could go on, but the gist of things is…I eventually came to appreciate America more than I did when I first left. I missed all the wonderful things about this country we take for granted — our humor, our food, our culture, our nature, everything. I missed the deep, deep blue skies of California, the diversity of cities like New York and Los Angeles, the beauty of states such as Wyoming or Montana. I missed the smell of the desert and the sea mingling in the air in downtown LA, the sweet humid perfume of the bayou in deep country Louisiana where my relatives live. I even missed our shitty politicians, our goofiness, our earnestness. I missed it all, so, so much, in a way that it was almost like a hunger. I longed for all those experiences, the history, and my connection it. I realized I was fine with being “American”, and all the good and bad connotations that come along with it. I don’t have time or the energy anymore after my mom’s death to care so much about putting on airs or trying to pretend to be something I am not. Take it or leave it, it’s who I am and will always be.
Of course it took me running away for a while to see it again.

First of all, before somebody complains, yes, France is not Paris. I am writing this as somebody who spends his time in Paris which is currently my equivalent to France.
After one week spent at the home of a friend in Chatou I moved out to have more chances discovering Paris and specifically Paris in the evening and taking care for myself. Frankly spoken, the second week (or first week after leaving my friend’s home), I spent at a hotel (Hipotel Paris Gambetta République, 20. Arr., 236 Rue des Pyrénées, 75020 Paris), so there’s not much about caring for yourself with cooking, cleaning and co.
The hotel I booked wasn’t luxurious nor exclusive. But it was charming and so was the neighborhood. And it gave me a first glimpse of what life is like there. The Rue des Pyrénées in the 20th Arrondissement is a nice street. Crowded, vibrant, and welcoming. When I left the hotel, everything you need to live was available in a radius of a five-minute walk.
In the area I had four supermarkets (supermarché like Carrefour City, Franprix, U Express, Picard for frozen products and other, smaller ones), bars and restaurants, stores (magasins) for e.g. fruits and vegetables, bakeries (boulangeries), butchers (boucheries), laundries (laveries), post offices, police, hospital, an elementary school (ecole) and so on.
My hotel provided a water heater for tee (and probably soups). So, without a kitchen, I used to go out dining. This, you can imagine, is not always cheap. But it was a way to discover different cuisines if it was halal.
Among others I visited an Indian restaurant, Sohna Punjab. It has been the first time I ever visited an Indian restaurant and I don’t regret it. I like spicy food and Sohna Punjab had spicy food. It was tasty and filling. Other restaurants I visited were a Turkish pizzeria and a Turkish diner across the street. Many Turkish restaurants, right? Right. I enjoy Turkish food.
Of course I didn’t just eat. I used to walk around to discover Paris. And I wasn’t looking for main attractions, but for the city itself. During my first week in Chatou, I saw the suburbs of what I would say was the middle-class or upper middle-class. Now it was about Paris itself. I most of the time walked in the 20th, 19th, 10th and 12th arrondissement.
Of course, I did it partly with my bicycle, even though I didn’t ride as often as I planned. This, I hope, is about to change.
Did I go shopping? Did I spend money on souvenirs? No, I didn’t. Apart from the fact that for future travel I don’t need more weight in my luggage, I had no interest in getting more plastics or decoration to stuff my future home. What I’ve bought was a magnet for my cousin. She loves magnets and so I got her one when I — you guessed right — discovered Paris and — right again — went to a restaurant (right, Turkish).
You can walk miles and miles in Paris. You surely don’t have to. Paris offers a lot of busses, trains and subways (Metro). But I barely use them if there’s no need to. I prefer walking, with my rucksack (sac a dos) on my back. Or, of course, with my bicycle. As I have already said, I didn’t spend as much time on riding, so I only rode the bike from Chatou to the 20th Arrondissement and then, later, I cruised a bit more than 11 kilometers in the 20ths.
And this is not all. Before moving to the new apartment, I used to visit Montmartre. Montmartre is a neighborhood in the 18th arrondissement, in the shadow of the church Sacre Coeur. I went there by using my feet. This is why I walked through areas surrounding the Garre de Nord. In some guides people say these areas were the most dangerous ones in Paris. When I’ve been walking in these areas, I didn’t feel threatened, but I realized that it was dirtier, poorer. It was the Paris you don’t see often in travel reports.
The contrast between the tourist hotspot Sacre Coeur and Montmartre (which lost the charm of an artist neighborhood to an overpriced tourism hotspot) couldn’t be wider. Souvenir shops, all selling the same stuff, and diners and restaurants selling over-sugared food, are welcoming tourists looking for a nice snapshot of Paris. I don’t blame the tourists, but the attractiveness of the city, I assume, is changing the identity of a city to please them with food (yes, I ate Turkish often, you’re right) which makes you feel that the city turns into a funfair. Despite that, I like Paris. And this is the reason, why I extended my stay in the city.
If you want to read more about my stay in Paris, visit my profile again. More posts are being published in the future. In the next article I will talk about living in the 17th Arrondissement, the Champs-Elysees, the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower at night.

After planning the trip for over a year, we were finally here. Our bags having been dropped off at the hotel, my wife, Sarah, and I were on a walk through Les Marais in Paris. Yes, that’s Paris, France. I had to remind myself a couple of times on this first walk just to be sure.
Then we turned a corner and the Seine itself coursed away in front of us. Notre Dame stretched to the sky and its glory was somehow undimmed by the scaffolding that has adorned it since the fateful fire in 2019. Then finally, after walking a few miles, grabbing dinner, and taking an Uber when our legs wouldn’t carry us one step further, we saw the Eiffel Tower. We were here.
That split second of traveler euphoria was quickly squelched as — no more than a minute after we had stepped out of the Uber — the rain started. It was slow at first. Sun was even breaking through and splashing over the famous curved iron. But then the rains really came.
We tried to hail an Uber, but none were available — probably because we were now part of a growing throng of people huddled underneath the measly branches of landscaped trees near the queue for the Tower. We looked at each other through rain-soaked eyelashes; our clothes were drenched.

I was 32 years old when I got the email that brought me to France. By then the course of my life looked pretty much circumscribed. Like many English people I spoke no foreign languages, and there was little to indicate that I would one day live abroad, apart from a taste for subtitled films, croissants and novels in translation.
Weekday mornings I took the Tube to my mildly enjoyable job at an advertising trade magazine, picking up a copy of The Times to read along the way. At weekends I ate pub lunches and ambled in the park and spent hours buried in the Sunday papers, just like everyone else. True, I travelled quite a bit — but nobody asked me to stay.
Then it came, out of the blue. A mail from somebody called François. I wish I’d kept it — but no. Still, the essence of it was: “We’re launching an English-language magazine in Paris and we’re looking for an editor. Your name has come up. Interested?”
Long story short, I moved to Paris.
I arrived on the day before my birthday, so the date is easy to remember. Today, the day I’m writing this post, marks my 20th year here. And I can tell you, it’s gone by in a flash. Yet so much has happened: love, marriage, a son, changes of address and changes of fortune.
But that’s not why you’re here. What you want to know is: how does living abroad for so long change you as a person?
In essence, I think, you keep the best of your homeland and jettison the rest. And you’re also free to adopt the most appealing aspects of your new home and pretty much ignore everything else.
Becoming Franglais
Let’s start with England. I kept the sense of humour — that was a given. I also retain an old-fashioned sense of courtesy. I’m chatty yet respectful with waiters, taxi drivers, store security guards, shop assistants…everyone, in fact. My (French) wife often remarks on how polite I am on public transport — not a very Parisian characteristic. My colleagues tell me I’m “a gentleman”. But this comes with a wariness of causing offence that can prevent me from speaking my mind — something my wife feels is tantamount to hypocrisy. “Is that your real answer?” she’ll say, after asking my opinion. “Or your English answer?”
I kept a whole roster of English-language films and books and poems that remain dear to me. And I still don’t mind the rain.
I lost my patriotism. I was never xenophobic, but learning another language has definitely made me more open. I recall stating quite often that London was the greatest city in the world, but I’ve revised that opinion. We all know where the “Britain is best” attitude led. Living in France has enabled me to understand the cultural jigsaw puzzle of Europe and see Britain’s place in it. When that piece went missing, I was appalled.
Yet at the same time, I wasn’t entirely surprised. There is a yobbish, jingoistic subculture in the UK that has always scared and disgusted me. Those groups of drunken young men stumbling around town on Saturday nights. I was delighted to leave them behind. Along with football. “Soccer”, if you prefer. The first conversational gambit of almost every British male. No, I don’t support a team. No, I didn’t see the match. And no, I’m really not interested in talking about it.
Food, now that’s interesting. It doesn’t take a French person long to get onto the subject — and I’ve become like them. I can hold my own on the wine front, too. In fact I’ve become addicted to bistros and brasseries, and a basket of bread with every meal.
But there’s also a particular sort of family meal here. It’s long and garrulous, with many courses and lots of debate, some of it heated. After my first dinner with my now-wife’s family, I asked her in amazement: “Do you always speak to your parents like that?”
Living in France has taught me a different way of being a family member. Be close. Be present. Show affection. We have dinner with Géraldine’s parents every Saturday — something I would never have imagined doing with my own parents, still less my partner’s.
Joie de vivre, actually
I’ve developed a different relationship to work and money. Back in London, people worked hard. They arrived at work early, they grafted, their lunch was often a sandwich at their desk. I respected them for that. Living in London is expensive, and you have to earn your keep. You can always de-stress in the pub at night.
In Paris it’s different. It irritated me at first. In my neighbourhood I’d try to go to the bank and the dry cleaner at lunchtime — and they were shut. The sandwiches on sale in supermarkets and even boulangeries were surprisingly bland: there’s only so much ham and cheese you can eat. The restaurants and the café terraces, on the other hand, were packed. What was it with these people? Didn’t they have work to do?
Yes, they did. But they also had lives to live. Friends to see. Small pleasures to enjoy. In general — and I’ve just checked this with my wife — French people are suspicious of the rich and bemused by workaholics. They are not lazy. But they don’t put work and money at the centre of their lives. One day, I got that. So instead of complaining, I decided to try their approach. The next day I was sitting on a café terrace at lunchtime, eating fillet of salmon with ratatouille and sipping a glass of rosé. I returned to work happy and motivated. I’m sorry, but the French have totally won lunchtime.
Emotionally, as well, I’ve become a little more French. I’m less afraid to show sadness, or anger — or even, indeed, fear. I’m no longer convinced that a stiff upper lip is the best expression to adopt.
I’ve also come to understand the concept of loyalty, which felt somewhat abstract back home. French people don’t have the easy familiarity of Americans, or the chirpy amiability of Brits, but once they decide that you’re a friend, they’re in it for life. Restaurants here work in a similar way, oddly enough. You know that waiter you considered aloof and cold? Go back the next night. Then the night after that. He’ll soon warm up. There are restaurants in Paris where I’m practically welcomed with open arms. Because I showed loyalty.
Paris, of course, is all about style. My wife thinks my personal style comes from England, as it leans heavily into tweed jackets or blazers, shirts with cufflinks and well-polished brogues. But the truth is that being an Englishman in Paris has accentuated that style. Paris gave me the urge to dress up — England gave me the building blocks. Plus in summer I love a stripy mariner’s T-shirt, which is totally français.
Talking of birthdays, there’s one thing I do that my wife tells me is very English. I send cards. Birthday, Christmas, Valentine’s…you name it. I take pride in selecting the prettiest ones. But they’re not so easy to find here, so I stock up when I’m in London.
Perhaps, in the end, that’s why I chose to settle in Paris. Culturally, it’s very different to the UK. But it’s also only a two and a half hours away by Eurostar. I really can have the best of both worlds.

In 2009, I left North America for the first time, to visit a place I had longed to see my whole life: Paris. Unlike most people I know, I didn’t imagine walking the streets wearing a beret with a baguette tucked beneath my arm. I didn’t care about visiting the pâtisseries or buying expensive, designer clothing. I wasn’t particularly interested in the museums, either.
There was one thing there that I had to see, above all else: Notre-Dame.
I can’t really explain this. I could give you a million reasons, though none fully illuminate this deep connection I have to a building I had never seen before.
For instance, I love its architecture. The flying buttresses are so beautiful, just looking at them makes my chest hurt. Then there are the gargoyles, so fiery and pagan, a strange juxtaposition to such a dignified edifice of the Catholic tradition. Then there are the rib vaults of the nave, the elegant spire, the gallery of the kings on the west façade, and of course, the beatific rose window. Its grandeur is so overwhelming to me, this building that has been standing for 857 years.

(Originally written in January, 2021)
In Netflix’s new show Emily in Paris, a young woman moves to Paris from Chicago to work at a fashion PR firm and finds success leveraging experiential and influencer campaigns for her clients. As I binge watched the first season, I couldn’t help but notice how non-traditional marketing ideas were central to the storylines. While the show exaggerates reality a lot, it also makes a statement about marketing and advertising; experiential and influencer marketing tactics are the most effective ways for brands to authentically connect with audiences. Below are some of the most memorable examples of non-traditional marketing from the first season of Emily in Paris, along with some relevant real world examples for reference.
Interactive Installations (Episode 5)
In this episode, Emily’s boss Sylvie makes a pitch to Hästens, a Swedish luxury bed company, but the client is not impressed with her traditional marketing idea. Emily then pitches her idea for an interactive campaign showing the beds at well-known Paris locations. The client likes her idea and Emily to activates a “social media installation” at La Place Dalida, placing the bed on the street for audiences to engage with and share on their social channels. Emily’s idea is reminiscent of one of my favorite IKEA activations from back in 2013 when the brand turned billboards into real bathrooms, complete with actors brushing their teeth and styling their hair at Paris’ Saint Lazare train station. You can read about it in this article on The Drum.
Introducing Brand Rituals (Episode 8)
In this episode Emily’s friend Mindy has friends visiting from China. When they are out partying, they celebrate by spraying each other with expensive champagne. Emily is inspired and, when she has the opportunity to pitch a potential new vineyard client, suggests they create a new ritual with their surplus of champaign. Her idea is that the vineyard should create a sub brand of Champagne that is exclusively promoted for spraying and can become the “Spray of Paris.” Emily’s idea of a brand creating or endorsing a ritual around their products has proven to be effective popularized by the Ice Bucket Challenge to promote awareness for ALS. Similarly Getting Iced is a ritual created to encourage drinking Smirnoff Ice.
Guerrilla PR Stunts (Episodes 9 and 10)
In episode 9, two avante-garde fashion designers who go by the name Grey Space show up to the AFL auction to bid on a dress that Emily is modeling. They proceed to pull off a publicity stunt by shooting her with paint and shocking the audience in the middle of the show. This concept is reminiscent of Banksy’s self shredding artwork at Sotheby’s last year, and shows the strength of leveraging a live stunt to generate press and talk value.
In episode 10, Pierre returns the favor to Grey Space by creating a PR stunt of his own, hijacking the outside of his former venue and presenting his new collection directly on the street in the middle of a crowd. The audience loves it, and his disruptive stunt goes viral making him the toast of Fashion Week. Pierre’s approach in this episode is reminiscent of more immersive fashion shows that have become popular over the past few years and demonstrate how more experiential and non-traditional approaches to presenting fashion are generating buzz, creating more press and translating to sales.
As the examples above indicate, Emily works with brands to tell creative stories through stunts and real world experiences that invite participation, feel culturally authentic and generate social media shares. If Emily in Paris is any indication of how Gen Z wants to be marketed to, brands should take note and put a bigger emphasis on non traditional marketing campaigns and projects in the coming year.

If Paris is the City of Light, it’s also the city of dog poop.
Anywhere you go, on any street, in any quarter, you’ll be greeted by the familiar sight of a dog’s breakfast. Or at least what remains of it.
Make no mistake: Paris is a fecal minefield. And it always has been.
In a city known for its refinement, you could argue that the dog poop here is made to perfection — so much so that canine excrement from other cities is a distant no. 2.
Because here, every dog poop is the product of hours of French savoir-faire in the art of dégustation, digestion and excretion — a celebration of craft that brings the community together. After all, the best way to give a merde about society is by leaving one behind.
So to celebrate Parisian solidarity, I thought it would be interesting to document the sheer variety of dog poop in Paris, before these most humble of creations go the way of the dinosaurs.
It’s a truism that dogs are allowed to poop next to trees. At least then, people can avoid tarnishing their soles with a stranger’s gift. But what happens when this gift isn’t gifted in the streets’ litter…

What Parisians can teach us about shaking up our morning routine.
“If you think adventure is dangerous, try routine; it is lethal.” — Paulo Coelho
Once upon a time, I was sitting inside a bar in the East Village of Manhattan with some NYU friends for happy hour. It was a rare occasion that we exited Bobst Library in time for after-work specials. Our conversation was in full swing, high-antioxidant wine was flowing, and of course, some bites graced the table. I cannot pinpoint the exact topic of the conversation, but I will forever remember the statement my fellow peer and dear friend made to this day — “Sometimes I feel like I am stuck between wanting a structured life and wanting to be a Bohemian.”
It was like time slowed down, the music blurred, the camera did that thing where it spins around you catching every angle of your body and intensifying your emotions. That’s it! That’s exactly how I feel! I thought to myself. On second thought, maybe I said it out loud. I carried on with my pumpkin soup and glass of red, and my life was forever changed.
Very nutrition student of you…
Walking the walk, you know.
For the rest of my life, I would continue with some sort of routine, but when it got too strict, too structured, too “routiney,” I would let my Bohemian side come out to play.
I am not here to tell you how Elon, Richard, Serena, or Beyoncé spend their mornings and then proceed to tell you to follow suit. I have said this before, and I will say it again, “what works for one person does not mean it works for everyone,” and other short stories by yours truly.
OK, Kelly so what are you here for then? Hurry up because I only have 8 more minutes to meditate, take a cold shower, and make my bone marrow coffee before I go to work. FML.
I am here to tell you that maybe the best morning routine allows for some wiggle room to shake things up once in a while. I’m not talking about an adrenaline-seeking, risk-taking, edge-of-your-seat, “Vegas, baby!” shaking up. I’m talking about instead of driving to work or taking the train, walking or biking; instead of gulping down drip coffee sipping on a Chai, or instead of meditating followed by journaling, reading a chapter in that book you have had on your nightstand for the past month.
2 months, actually.
I appreciate the honesty.
You have your habits, your rituals, and your overall routine, and you like it, but you cannot handle it when it doesn’t go exactly to plan. Your heart thumps and your nerves move to the edge of your skin wanting an out, how dare someone get sick on the train and make me late for my panda-hugging class! Maybe that morning routine needs a vacation, or maybe it just needs a good cry.
You aren’t talking about my routine anymore, are you…?
You do not need to have a ridged morning routine 7 days a week to be successful. Each day may be different and some people love plans and routines while others do not. Sometimes a morning routine is a product of your personality and sometimes it is a product of your environment, life situation, or culture.
For years I have loved to have some sort of morning routine. It has shifted and changed a bit from time to time. When I moved from NYC to Paris the change in my morning routine was mainly because of the change in my environment, work, and life situation. While NYC and Paris have some similarities (the metro is packed like sardines in both cities), they also have a lot of differences, and one difference that stood out to me was the morning routine of the people of Paris.
Let’s go back to New York first.
“I gotta go schlepp uptown.”
“Can’t gotta work.”
“See you at the gym at 6 AM?”
“I’ll have a quadruple espresso, please.” (I’m not exaggerating; I heard it for myself, Wall Street, 2015).
“I’m getting on this train whether these people think I am or not.” (The train stalls after getting on).
“I think a rat just ran over my foot.”
“Walk faster.”
God, I love New York!
Is this nostalgic for some of you? Above are snippets of New Yorkers’ conversations, either with another person or with themselves. For some of you, moments like these are a distant memory. Now you wake up, roll out of bed, move your computer’s mouse around, and put on the Pivot Podcast while you shower.
My New York mornings were calculated as they involved taking the 6 train from the Upper East Side to Wall Street. I wakeup, caffeine in the form of black coffee or Matcha, brush my teeth, put cold water on my face, exercise, shower, skincare, mascara, under-eye concealer, lipstick, pinch cheeks, and delete those text messages from the night before because “out of sight out of mind,” grab my breakfast to have at work and do an Olympic power walk to the train. Once at work, I would check my emails while eating breakfast. Boom- chakalaka. I was high off “the hustle.”
Once back to work, I fell slightly back into calculating my mornings. It was like riding a bike, once learned and never forgotten. A couple of days a week I taught Pilates at 7 AM. I would wake up giving myself exactly 60 minutes to brush my teeth, wash my face, dab on some tinted face cream and under-eye concealer, chug cold brew, walk to work, and eat breakfast in the bathroom 5 minutes before teaching so I would not pass out from low blood sugar, and by that time the cold brew kicked in the city was the best place on earth. My 7 AM clients got the best of me.
On the other mornings, I worked from home. I still woke up fairly early to get in some morning movement before work. My weekends, both pre and post-pandemic, were quite different, but not drastically different, and I wanted them that way. My weekends were like my adventure not to make my routine lethal. But why did I have to leave all of that up to the weekend?
Let me guess. Society? Culture?
It is quite likely that they tested the workweek waters. I was just thinking out loud.
To summarize and generalize, mornings in New York are:
wake and Drake before 7 AMcover the dark circles under your eyesbrush and rushget coffee and something to eat on the gomiss your train by .7 secondsgrab the next one right behind itsit on the train because of train trafficget off the train|confirm dinner date plans while walking to the officepush the arrow up buttonface your childhood fear of elevatorsthrow all of your worries behind as you enter the office with a smile on your face.
Usually every night I take a walk to the steps of the church of Saint-Etienne-du-Mont. Then at the stroke of midnight, a car full of drunk characters that look like they came from a Great Gatsby party pulled up to whisk me away to a literary joint for champagne and storytelling.
Wow, there must be something in the champagne over there…
Good one. This is not a true event, but can’t we all just take a moment to appreciate Midnight in Paris? Merci Beaucoup.
Now for the real Paris life. No, I did not eat croissants every morning or have a cigarette on the balcony overlooking the Parisian architecture as the sun rose. Although, in honesty, I very easily could have. Paris is filled with the smell of freshly baked bread and pastries (and cigarette smoke), and you do not have to pay a fortune to have a balcony as part of the apartment package.
I still had structure even though my work was far less structured, and I still moved my body in the morning doing some sort of exercise even though Paris is not a culture of morning structured workouts. Take my neighbor Camille for example, she got in her morning movement by biking to work, and in heels (I know this because I could hear it through our old, charming Parisian walls).
My mornings in Paris were much, well slower. I would open the shutters, go out on the balcony (I know New Yorker, keep manifesting, and until then enjoy the fire escape), take a deep breath, use the bathroom, mist my face with Evian water (stop judging, I live in France, remember), prepare coffee (no longer cold brew), and breakfast, conduct a mini skincare routine, move my body and eat breakfast at a real-life table. But this post is not to tell you all about what I did and I do. I am still an American after all. What have I observed about real-life Parisians? Read on.
Let’s paint the picture. Typically the Parisian will wake up early unless they are an artist or such, then whatever, c’est la vie! Coffee is a must, and those who choose tea are not condemned for choosing the other liquid cocaine. Coffee is typically not hyper-caffeinated cold brew, although the hipsters have imported that to town so do not be surprised if you see it on the menu. Classic coffee choices range from café allongé (the French Americano, with less water), café au lait (coffee with milk), cappuccino, or a café latte. At breakfast, and only at breakfast, a traditional French thing to do is to have your morning brew in a mug that is more like a bowl (think big enough to comfortably dip a croissant or piece of baguette into your warm frothy milk coffee). If you have never dipped a croissant or piece of baguette into your cappuccino I highly recommend you give it a try. Dietitian approved.
Food Nerd alert.
Why, thank you.
Commonly at brasseries, they will offer a petit-déjeuner (breakfast) menu of a hot drink (coffee, tea, or hot chocolate), cold drink (typically orange juice), tartine (usually baguette) with butter and jam, or viennoiserie (a pastry such as a croissant or pain au chocolat- a chocolate croissant). At home, the classic petit-déjeuner meal is similar, or other more modern-day options are to have yogurt, some fruit, or cereal. But bread is always a good idea in Paris.
Paris also serves the global masses, and brunch or a wider variety of breakfast foods are offered at some cafes and restaurants for tourists or homesick expats.
One of the places that I loved visiting in Paris was the pharmacy. I know what you are thinking, weirdo, but hear me, or read me, out. The pharmacies here just hit differently. When I first moved to Paris I thought, Ooooh lala look at all of these French brands, SVR Laboratories, Bioderma, and Embryolisse, oh my! Then I remembered, oh yeah, I’m in France, this is just the norm. The morning skincare routine offers more variety for the skin to devour than the French breakfast, but it is just as simple and enjoyable. Customarily speaking, micellar water or cleansing milk is used to cleanse the skin followed by a toner such as rosewater, a dab of eye cream, a serum, and a moisturizer, likely with SPF. Exfoliation products are used, but less often, and are very gentle. Voila.
Parisians are generally not going to get up and hit the gym early in the morning. My schedule for teaching Pilates completely changed when I moved to Paris. No more chug and teach.
I cannot find a yoga class before 11 AM and the only dance class I can find before 10 am is on Saturdays. I’m not saying they don’t exist, but they are not in demand.
What are they doing if they are not hitting the gym? Well, not rushing through their morning coffee or breakfast for one. My husband gets up about 1.5 hours before he leaves for work to sit and drink his coffee, read sports news, eat something small, and take a long shower. I witnessed one gym during my time in Paris, but mostly I see people biking, jogging, or walking outside a lot.
Parisians love to be outside (some people say so they can smoke la cigarette), but they also are more likely to, say, jog outside than jog on a treadmill inside. The same goes for biking. The morning commute is a typical way for Parisians to get in movement and to get outside. Just beware of the bikes.
I am always amazed by the difference in the sun while in different parts of the world. In Dubai, it looks bigger, like it is staring at you in your face, demanding attention. In Paris, it shines later into the night during the Summer months, until about 10:30 PM, and the sunrise shifts as well. I remember waking up at our apartment in November thinking it was probably 5 AM because it was still so dark outside. It was 8 AM.
Paris offers you a view from a different angle of the morning routine. I hope this peek into Parisian life may inspire you to add a petite adventure to your morning routine. You do not have to jump on a plane and arrive here by morning to live a little Parisian. Remember, trains stall here too, so bring a good book with you and bof it off.
I think that often many of us (moi-self included) romanticize Paris. Now that I write this I think Americans romanticize all of Europe in general. You may have heard that saying before “Europeans go to America to work, Americans go to Europe to live.” Perhaps that came from the history of immigration to the US for the “American Dream,” back in the day when people from all over Europe entered the East Coast of America by boat to start a new life and a new business. When they went back home to Europe they could finally relax a little. Whatever the reason may be sometimes it feels good to fantasize about a place far, far away.
Which brings me back to that one night in New York. I had a vision of myself at the intersection between Orderly Avenue and rue de Nonconformist; one of those hallucinations that are so real that if it didn’t happen in real life you are going to make it happen in real life. I have revisited the saying “structured bohemian,” in my mind multiple times since that evening. I relate well to opposites — organized chaos, imperfect symmetry, the sun and the moon, not one or the other. I am the equivalent of both. The same went for a routine. Too much I felt stagnant. Too little I felt unsteady. I craved balance. But balance isn’t frigid. It is room temperature, flowing, swaying, and calm.
French icon Coco Chanel once said, “You were born an original, don’t become a copy !”
I think this is helpful when thinking about a morning routine. There is a difference between being inspired by someone and being influenced by someone. I provide examples of my personal morning routines and that of some Parisians, but the last thing I want is for one to feel pressured into copying another culture or particular person’s routine. The meaning behind this message is to help you notice when you are being too strict with yourself and also to be aware when something calls to you. If you would rather sleep a little more in the morning than wake up and journal, then let sleep be your meditation. If you have more energy in the morning then be inspired by some morning movement.
Finally, allow yourself to change. I can say with absolute assurance my morning routine now is not the same as it was when I was 25 years old. If you are overloading your morning with all the trends from all the cultures and all the people are you honoring your own needs? Your wants? Permit yourself to let your inner Bohemian come out to play.

In ways both small and large, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games is a series of firsts. It will be the first in the history of the Games to include breakdancing (or “breaking”) as a competitive event, and the first to achieve gender parity. Paris 2024 may also achieve the Games’ highest level of sustainability yet by becoming the first to halve its carbon emissions compared to the average of London 2012 and Rio 2016.
The goal has been years in the making, set in motion by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) — the Lausanne, Switzerland–based body that oversees all matters related to the Games and the Olympic Movement at large — and the IOC’s Olympic Agenda 2020, a roadmap that spells out its broader goals. Sustainability is a key pillar of that roadmap. The IOC has committed to reducing its direct and indirect emissions by 50 percent by 2030, when all Olympic Games must also commit to reducing carbon emissions and compensate for more than 100 percent of their residual emissions.
“Paris 2024 is the first edition to fully embrace this ambition of the strategic roadmap,” Marie Sallois, IOC’s director of corporate and sustainable development, told Convene. “From Day One, [Paris 2024] was conceived with sustainability in mind.” In fact, the Paris 2024 Organizing Committee — the body responsible for planning, organizing, financing, and delivering the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris in 2024 — pledged to halve carbon emissions during its bid, in step with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
That goal initiated a complete overhaul of the Games’ sustainability strategy, chiefly switching from a post-Games assessment to setting a pre-Games target and defining a carbon budget early on: less than 1.7 million tons of CO2. This carbon budget is treated much like a financial budget, where “every decision you make about an event, an activation,” Sallois said, “you must take into account how much it costs, how many people will work on it, and how much carbon it emits.”
“That’s a very different approach than the one we took in the past,” she said. Although many editions of the Games had “interesting, innovative solutions in terms of sustainability” — Sallois cited the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, which embraced circularity with recycled Olympic Medals and podiums — for Paris 2024, she said, “sustainability was first and foremost.”
Come July 26, 2024, when the opening ceremony kicks off, spectators and athletes will see this new iteration of the Games come to life, one where nearly every facet of the experience has been revised to lessen its environmental impact. “Some things are incremental, some things are drastic,” Sallois said. But overall, the strategy has been to “look at… the levers that contribute the most to the footprint.”
Of those levers, infrastructure ranks as one of the largest. Already, Paris 2024 has achieved a new benchmark in this category — 95 percent of the venues for the Games will utilize existing or temporary structures, the highest percentage of any previous Olympic Games. That includes historic sites that have been modernized — like Yves-du-Manoir Stadium, which served as the main venue for the eighth Olympiad in 1924 and will host the field hockey competitions for Paris 2024 — and temporary facilities, like an outdoor arena that will host the Olympic and Paralympic equestrian jumping and dressage competitions on the Etoile Royale esplanade at Château de Versailles.
The design of the new Aquatics Centre, the only permanent sports facility built for Paris 2024, meets stringent environmental standards. It has been built primarily with wood rather than concrete or steel, both of which create carbon dioxide in their manufacturing process, and will require less cooling and heating, aided by the rooftop solar array. The Olympic and Paralympic Village also demonstrates how infrastructure for the Games can be built using sustainable construction methods to lower emissions. Stretching into the neighborhoods of Seine-Saint-Denis, Ile Saint-Denis, and Saint-Ouen, the 126-acre site will accommodate 14,500 athletes and their staff during the Olympic Games followed by 9,000 athletes and their staff during the subsequent Paralympic Games. The Village’s carbon footprint is also 30 percent smaller than that of a modern construction project as a result of using wood and recycled materials. The latter, Sallois said, represents how the Village exemplifies “how we want to build for the future,” by not just focusing on lowering carbon emissions, but creating climate-resilient infrastructure.
Powering Paris 2024 infrastructure using renewable energy — like the geothermal-powered Olympic Village — will be a first for the Games, Sallois said, and what she thinks holds significant potential for the events industry at large. “Often in the past, the model for large events — and this is true for events other than sporting events — [is diesel] generators as a primary source of energy,” she said.
Instead, a newly created grid operated by French partner Enedis and EDF will supply Paris 2024 venues with energy produced via off-site wind and solar farms. According to the IOC, it will save 14,000 tons of carbon emissions. And it’s also permanent, helping to further the legacy of Paris 2024 by allowing future events to harness renewable energy, too — an idea that Sallois believes represents “a big shift for the industry of events.”
Solar energy generated on site also is helping to power the event. The Aquatics Centre’s photovoltaic panel-covered roof is intended to supply all of the facility’s energy needs and also will qualify as one of France’s largest urban solar farms. Similar installations will be added to the Olympic Village, the Transport Mall, and even the Seine, where a floating solar power plant with 7,750 square meters will supply energy to the Games and will be repurposed elsewhere later. Even the backup generators — essential in the event of interruptions in energy supply — will run on biofuels.
It helps that Paris is already one of the most walkable cities in the world, which is further bolstered by a robust public transportation system and the fact that many of Paris 2024’s major venues will be centrally located within the city.
“Paris, together with IOC, has completely revisited … transportation operations and the transportation plan to not only use the most efficient transportation means from a sustainability point of view, but also to reduce, in total, the [need for] transportation,” said Panos Tzivanidis, the IOC’s director of corporate events and services.
For Paris 2024, venues have been cherrypicked for their proximity to public transport — even beyond Paris. Lyon, Saint-Etienne, Nice, Bordeaux, Nantes, and Marseille will all serve as Olympic host sites in 2024, with France’s high-speed TGV rail network connecting spectators to those cities and other Olympic sites around France. Within Paris, those spectators will have the Paris metro to rely on, which has expanded routes for the Games, along with nearly 260 miles of bike lanes, including 54 miles of recently added lanes that will create new access points to competition venues. Thousands of extra bikes will be available for spectator use via Vélib, a public bike-sharing program. In addition, Toyota will provide a fleet of electric- and hydrogen-fueled transportation options on hand for athletes, staff, and spectators.
“Paris 2024 is really a turning point in our approach [to legacy] because now it’s really us adapting to the city, and no longer the [city] adapting to us,” Sallois said. That includes ensuring new infrastructure can be purposefully adapted and tailored to the needs of the host destination in the afterlife of the Games — a key goal laid out in the IOC’s Olympic Agenda 2020.
For example, the Aquatics Centre intends to benefit the residents of Seine-Saint-Denis, an area in Northeast Paris. During the Games, the Aquatics Centre will host the artistic swimming, water polo, and diving events but after it will provide a dedicated facility for the community — a huge asset considering that it’s an under-resourced area in terms of infrastructure and that six out of 10 teens in the area do not know how to swim. In addition, the Olympic Village site will provide the local community with more than 2,800 new housing units, two new schools, 14 acres of green space, and a new bridge crossing the Seine that links the Île-Saint-Denis and Saint-Denis neighborhoods, among other infrastructure.
For Paris 2024, legacy also goes beyond infrastructure. Paris 2024 “has a very clear legacy that has been already delivered prior to the Games,” Sallois said. “It means that the legacy is not something that you think about during the Games or after, you plan for it… to be delivered before the Games.” A prime example is Paris 2024’s commitment to motivating the country’s youth to exercise more. According to the National Observatory of Physical Activity (ONAPS), 37 percent of children between 6 and 10 years old and 73 percent of 11- to 17-year-olds do not get the recommended minimum of 60 minutes of daily physical activity. Paris 2024 has been successfully advocating for this cause through various initiatives, including convincing 36,250 French primary schools to add 30 minutes of movement to their daily schedule. “We are currently running a survey in one of the cities where these different measures have been introduced,” Sallois said, “and we know already that it has had an impact on the concentration, for instance, of kids at school.”
Sallois also pointed to how Paris 2024 has provided more economic opportunities to local businesses and organizations. According to the IOC, “early planning before the election of Paris 2024 as an Olympic host showed that the Games would generate activity for 181,000 jobs in a wide range of areas, including event organization, tourism, catering, and construction.” To streamline the process of applying for these opportunities, Paris 2024 created a new platform to ensure small businesses could compete with those with larger resources, Sallois said. This is part of a social charter solidified in 2018 between local trade unions and employer organizations, a first in Olympic history, to open up more opportunities and resources for job seekers and small businesses.
The result? “Ninety percent of the suppliers for Paris 2024 are French, and 75 percent of them are small- and medium-sized organizations,” Sallois said. “This is a big achievement — [especially] for the smaller businesses, because they have gained skills and a competitive advantage.”
Sallois emphasized that flexibility — the ability to adapt to the host territory — will continue to be key to future Olympic Games. Paris is “a very old city with a lot of existing infrastructure,” she said, and with L.A. 2028, “you’re again in a very large city with a lot of infrastructure and this is why they decided to go to a radical reuse approach — no new venues will be built.” The Olympic Village will use the UCLA campus, she said, “so it’s really a radical shift.”
One difference between L.A. and Paris is that travel by car is heavily favored in L.A, but Sallois is undeterred. “Still, we can innovate,” she said. For example, buses can be low-carbon buses. “We will find solutions, we just need to work with the constraints we have in a certain geography,” she said, but that often just means “we will innovate even more. I mean, because the Games take place every four years, by the time we reach Los Angeles, there will be new solutions on the market.”
Using Paris 2024 as a test pilot, the IOC and other entities worked with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to develop a new methodology for evaluating the social, economic, and environmental benefits of events. Guidelines based on this new methodology were released by the OECD in late 2023 for organizers to use for their own events, which can be downloaded in two parts: How to Measure Impact and Impact Indicators. Paris 2024 also has inspired another new set of guidelines — an updated ISO standard for managing the social, economic, and environmental impact of events, set to be released just prior to Paris 2024’s kickoff.
For London 2012, “we released for the first time ISO 20121, and now with Paris we are aiming at releasing the new version that will [reach] another level,” IOC’s Marie Sallois said, adding that the updated standard will put a greater emphasis on human rights, social justice, and legacy. The IOC’s Panos Tzivanidis said that the certification is “an important milestone” for not just Paris 2024, but for the IOC’s institutional events at large. “It ensures that every event we touch is aligned with our vision for a greener and more sustainable future.”
“An evaluation of the sustainability of the Olympic Games,” a study published in the April 2021 issue of online monthly journal Nature Sustainability, ranks Olympic Games — specifically those held between 1992 and 2020 — as only marginally sustainable. The study’s authors collectively rank the Games as “medium” — 48 out of 100 possible points on the scale devised for the study.
Broadly, the study states that it defines a “sustainable Olympic Games” as having three dimensions: “having a limited ecological and material footprint, enhancing social justice, and demonstrating economic efficiency.” According to the study, the Games could improve its marks by drastically reducing the size of the event, rotating the event between the same cities to reduce waste from building new infrastructure, and create an independent body to develop and enforce new sustainability standards. However, such actions come with obstacles, including a significant reduction in revenue from downsizing.
But the potential to make a positive impact — beyond the Games themselves — is huge. As the Nature Sustainability study points out, “together with their exceptional visibility, the Olympic Games provide a unique platform to reach a global audience and could serve as a model for cities, countries, and other events around the world to emulate.”

As a guide, the tourists and visitors, French or foreigners, that I guide ask me what to do in Paris, apart from the (too) famous Louvre and Montmartre district. They ask me what are my favourite places in Paris, what are the nice, cheap and tourist-free places where you can enjoy the city.
During my wanderings in the streets of Paris, I have collected little tips and cultural, artistic, and natural activities, totally free to do in the French capital. All you have to do is pick from this list and enjoy your moment without spending a penny. Ready to go?
If you have been reading me for some time, you must know my passion for modern art. I may be overdoing it BUT I have to admit that it is the best period in art history. Well, you know what, it is possible to enjoy modern art in Paris completely free of charge, with a view of the Eiffel Tower to boot. The Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, commonly known as MAM, is an artistic showcase in the heart of a pompous corner of the capital, a stone’s throw from the Eiffel Tower. What’s more, the entire display was redone a few months…

Paris, the City of Lights, is renowned worldwide for its rich culture and sophistication. It is famous for its world-class art museums like the Louvre and the Musée d’Orsay, iconic Hausmannian architecture, and manicured gardens like the Jardin des Tuileries and the Jardin du Luxembourg. Fashion, gastronomy, and fine wines are celebrated features of Parisian life.
Paris has also been a hub for major artistic and philosophical movements throughout history. Impressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism found fertile ground here, while the Age of Enlightenment and modern philosophy flourished amidst the city’s intellectual vibrancy. There is a lot to see and do in Paris, and it is one of the most visited cities in the world.
I was ecstatic when my family relocated to Paris in the summer of 2022. The City of Lights has long captivated my imagination, and moving there was a dream come true for me and my husband in many ways. We settled in our new neighborhood, with the Eiffel Tower, affectionately known as The Iron Lady — -standing nearby. We delighted in the perfectly cooked baguettes, delectable cheese, and flaky viennoiseries and tried the traiteurs and restaurants nearby. My daughter loved discovering all the whimsical carousels scattered throughout the city. We walked along the Seine at night, significantly cooling during the warm summer nights. I visited multiple exhibits and discovered artists I had never known. The city’s offering of Classical music concerts allowed me to deepen my appreciation for Bach and Vivaldi, among many others.
Living in Paris has refined my senses. I now have an eye for Western art, an ear for classical music, a refined palate, and a newfound appreciation for architectural grandeur. I have always loved nature and did not think a condensed city would be as magnificent as it would be. But I was wrong. Paris breathed beauty, and I inhaled its beauty.
Beyond its renowned culture and sophistication, Paris unexpectedly unveiled a mystical dimension. It was mystical in that when I visited certain places (other places I will discuss in later blogs), I felt a stronger connection to the Divine, the universe, or, as some would say, God. I was filled with the same awe that had gripped me while walking amongst the Redwoods in California, exploring Sedona’s red canyons, and watching the sunset on a Hawaiian beach.
This mystical energy became clearer as I uncovered the history of Paris. Around the 3rd century BC, the Parisii, a Celtic sub-tribe of the Senones, settled along the Seine River. The Parisii were one of the many Celtic tribes that made up the larger population of Gauls. The Gauls inhabited much of western Europe during the Iron Age and the Roman Age (5th century BC to 5th century AD), including modern-day France, Belgium, Switzerland, parts of Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic. They did not have a unified government or leadership but were composed of many tribes who could unite for large-scale military operations. They were known for their warrior culture and artistic achievements, such as metalwork, jewelry, and pottery. They built bridges and a fort, minted coins, and traded with other European riverine settlements.
The Gauls believed in many Gods and Goddesses. Their religion was deeply connected to nature, with spirits believed to inhabit forests, rivers, and other natural features. Druids, highly educated individuals with extensive knowledge of religion, law, medicine, astronomy, and other subjects, acted as religious leaders, teachers, and advisors in their community.
Based on etymological interpretations, Druids translates to the “oak-knower” or “knowing the oak tree.” Little is known about what the Druids were really like, and the recorded history written about them is from Roman accounts, which may not always be entirely accurate or objective. Some scholars believe women may have also played important roles within Druidic traditions, possibly as priestesses, healers, or teachers. Julius Caesar provides the most well-known Roman account of the Druids in his book “Commentarii de Bello Gallico (“Commentaries on the Gallic War”).
Here is what was included in his description:
However, the Roman conquest of Gaul, which included the area of Paris, and the arrival of Christianity led to the suppression of Druidic practices. In 52 BC, the Romans conquered the Parisii and established the Gallo-Roman town of Lutetia on the central island of Paris, where the Parisii settled. Christianity took root in Lutetia during the 3rd century AD.
After the fall of the Roman Empire, Clovis I, the King of the Franks, seized control of the city and designated it as the capital of his kingdom. This began Paris’ importance as a European political and cultural center.
Fast forward to the modern day, I was surprised to see Paris’ Celtic history represented at the Opening Ceremony for the 2024 Summer Olympics. As part of the program, a mechanical metallic horse carrying the Olympic flag galloped through the Seine with a rider wearing a metal suit. It was captivating and left a lasting impression on me. I wanted to learn about the symbolism, and I discovered that the horse and the rider symbolized not only the Olympic spirit of resilience, peace, solidarity, and unity but also the goddess Sequana, a revered deity in Gallic mythology.
Information about the Goddess Sequana is derived from excavations performed at her sanctuary located at the principal source of the Seine River called the Fontes Sequanae, near Châtillon-sur-Seine in the Burgundy region of France. In the mid-18th century, archaeologists discovered the foundations of a massive rectangular building (57 meters by 18 meters) within a valley near the source of the Seine River, with an inscription that read “DEA SEQUANA,” identifying the site as a sanctuary dedicated to the goddess Sequana. In 1933, renowned artist Henri Corot made a significant discovery: the bronze statue of the goddess Seine was found near a faun statue.
Archaeological excavations in 1863–1967 confirmed that this was once a pilgrimage site for devotees. Excavations yielded an impressive collection of roughly 1,500 votive offerings crafted from stone, bronze, and wood. The offerings contained specific body parts — eyes, limbs, sexual organs, and even internal organs — suggesting that the pilgrims must have sought the goddess’s divine intervention to heal ailments represented by the body parts. Sculptures often depicted pilgrims presenting gifts to the goddess, such as money, fruit, or their cherished pets — dogs and birds. Despite her Celtic origins, Sequana was eventually adopted into the broader framework of Gallo-Roman religious worship.
The Seine, a 485-mile (780-kilometer) river, flows northwest through the heart of Paris and empties into the English Channel at the Normandy coast. Lined with charming cafes and iconic landmarks, it is one of Paris’ major tourist attractions.
I love going for walks along the Seine. Sometimes, I find a bench or place along the quai and sit there awhile. I stare at its beauty as the sun dances on its surface, and in the evenings, I bask in its glory as the illuminated lights of the city shimmer and sparkle like stars in its waters. Then the world slows down, and the city’s frenetic pace fades into a distant hum as I go within to a place of stillness. I feel a sense of awe, a divine feminine energy surrounding me. Sequana, with her effortless grace, invites me to pause and simply be. She reminds me that amidst the chaos of city life, there is always a place for peace and serenity where my soul can find solace.
Living in Paris, I am slowly recreating the myth that connecting to the Divine in a big, condensed city is difficult. By uncovering Paris’ history and connecting to the beautiful myths of the people who once lived here, I, too, sense the magic they felt by the Seine River, the splendor of the Goddess Sequana.
Where do you live? Do you know your city’s history and myths? Do you have a place where you could be with yourself and simply BE?

Helping You Adapt to Life in France

In case you missed Part 1, I’m sharing my unique journey from I’ll-never-live-abroad to nearly-10-years-in-France-and-counting.
I’m often asked how I did it — and while several of my articles on TAIP touch on how I’ve been able to stay, I wanted to write it all out in a way that could be copied by anyone reading. Okay, maybe not anyone. It took a lot of hard work to build my life here in France, and it isn’t over yet. I’ll be starting my journey to citizenship next, which promises to be full of paperwork and even more determination.
But, I’m getting ahead of myself. Below I’m picking up where I left off on Part 2: I was an au pair, didn’t want to continue on as an au pair, but didn’t want to go back to the US just yet. Here’s how I figured out a way to stay.
I was always one of those people who said, “Never again!” after finishing my undergrad. It wasn’t that I didn’t like school — on the contrary, I’ve always enjoyed learning — but I was sick of papers and tests and all of the other coursework that went along with it.
Famous last words. As I finished up my second year as an au pair, I didn’t have many options other than the easy-to-obtain student visa. I decided I wanted to get my master’s degree. Public education is cheap here and I knew I’d regret it if I didn’t. This time, however, I was going to study something I was actually interested in, not something that would lead to a job one day.
I settled on French Literature. I’ve always loved reading and writing and I figured I might as well study the greats while I was in the city where many of them worked and lived. The only wrench in my plan? I still, after 2.5 years, could not speak or read French. In my defense, I came over here only knowing the basics, and as an American au pair, I was required to speak English with the children I took care of. At this point, I knew could understand about 75% of what was said to me, but I couldn’t speak back. It was a combination of a lack of vocabulary and confidence.
What’s more, I knew I wanted to go to a public school (again, cheap), and to do so as a foreigner I had to have a certain level of French, with a certificate to prove it. So, I looked around for some programs that would meet the student visa requirement of 20 hours per week. I found two: one at the famous La Sorbonne and one at the also famous Université Nanterre. I missed the deadline for La Sorbonne so that left me with Nanterre.
I applied, got in, looked for housing (and found the deal of a lifetime: I traded 10 hours of English lessons per week for a 9m2 sardine box in the sky), went back to America for a few weeks, got my student visa, and returned to home to Paris. Back to school, I went.
And so began my year-long journey to learning French. I loved my program — and recommend it to anyone who wants to live here long-term — I was the only Anglophone and so the only common language my classmates and I had was (broken) French. Our teachers also insisted that we speak in French instead of our native language. It was difficult, but it also felt like the best place to do it. Everyone had an accent, and everyone was trying to learn.
I met some very kind people, finally learned French, and also discovered more about French culture. We went on field trips in Paris and the Île-de-France region and ultimately all became quite close. Spending 20+ hours per week together will do that.
With my B2 certificate in hand, I was finally ready to apply for my master’s. I still wanted to study French Literature, and so started to look at those kinds of programs. I had a couple of informational interviews at various universities in town, before sitting down with one guidance counselor in particular.
She looked over my resume and experiences and asked why I didn’t want to study English Literature instead of French. At this point, I had started dabbling in freelance writing and had indicated that on my CV, and well…the whole “native English speaker” thing. I told her it felt silly to come all the way to France only to study English. Mais non! she assured me, and encouraged me to look into English Literature programs instead.
The meeting piqued my interest, and soon the curse of the missed deadline struck again — but it was for the best. Nanterre University, where I completed my French course, had a bilingual English Literature master’s program. Because I was already in their system, it was very easy to apply. I was accepted almost immediately (again, native English speaker), paid my tuition (400 € for the year), and began.
I loved my teachers, loved my program, and bonded with my peers. No, I never wanted to go back to school, but completing my master’s at a French public university was one of the best experiences I’ve ever had. I’ll never regret it.
After my two-year program, spoiler alert, I still wasn’t ready to go home. I met my now-husband about halfway through year one and things had gotten very serious very quickly, in true French dating fashion. We were making serious plans for the future. But…what about my visa?
I obtained the APS visa, which gives you a year to look for work after you graduate from a French institution. I did look for a job but I knew I wanted to work in English (even to this day I can’t write in French beyond simply texting), and finding a job that aligned with that was difficult. I had no issue finding Anglophone clients, but there wasn’t a need for full-time English writers in Paris — or at least, the jobs that I found didn’t pay very well.
The APS visa was quickly running out, so what’s a girl in a relationship with a French person to do? The marriage conversation happens. I’m lucky that I was with someone who I knew I wanted to spend my life with, visa issue or not. So, we made plans to quickly marry at the town hall so that I could obtain the vie privée et familiale visa.
Long story short, I did get that visa and so my future in France was secured for life. I’m not saying that everyone needs to meet a French person and marry them in order to stay here (indeed, there’s an entire shady trade in this which we may write about in the future) — there are a lot of other options out there including the profession libérale visa, or even a long-stay visitor visa if citizenship isn’t important — but in my unique situation, my husband is the reason I was allowed to stay.
That’s the gist of it — a couple thousand words on my journey to France. I hope it will serve as inspiration for anyone else who may find themselves thinking, but wait, I don’t want to leave too.

Paris is an amazing destination, but it can be even more fun if you know a few insider hints. I have been traveling to France since 1979 when I did my junior year abroad there. I became a French teacher and have been back to Paris around 25 times. Each time I go I learn something new, and many things can help someone enjoy the city more if you know them. Here are a few to help you.
The Louvre
Enter the Louvre through the metro and get off at station Palais Royale-Le Louvre(you will enter directly into the museum) and not the station that says Le Louvre( This will have you exit across the street to the Louvre) Something new though, you have to have your ticket to enter into the museum part of the Louvre, but it is easy to buy online through the Louvre at www.louvre.com or through the Paris tourist office at www.parisjetaime.com If you do not have a ticket you will have to enter through the pyramid by getting off at the Louvre metro or walking there.
There are bathrooms under both sides under the stairs. You do not have to pay to use them. If you use the bathroom in the food court you will have to pay a euro and 50 centimes.
Restaurants
The tip is included in your bill. Unfortunately, we have encountered a few waiters who have tried to take advantage of travelers by claiming the tip is not…

Fans of the film Casablanca know that when Rick comforts Lisa he means people will always have memories of people and places and moments in time.
The thing is, Paris — partly thanks to such films as Casablanca, Midnight in Paris, and Forget Paris (and many others) — revels in its reputation as the City of Light, the City of Love, a city rich in history and literature.
Much of that reputation lies in layers of myth, as many visitors soon learn the minute they step into the Arrivals section at Charles De Gaulle (CDG) airport.
Paris is a big, noisy, and bustling city. No two ways about it.
Rose-colored glasses soon fall to the pavement. And tourists fall victim to “Paris Syndrome,” seeming similar to Stendahl Syndrome, a condition that visitors to Florence suffer from too much beauty. Yet there’s a difference, yes?
Regardless, I love Paris, with all its warts and issues.
Believe me, warts exist. Note that I have visited Paris at least twelve times, for varying lengths of time.
But it’s understandable how so many of the millions of yearly travelers fail to find the Paris of their dreams.
Take my most recent trip, in March/April 2023.
During the first week, I wound up dodging garbage piled HIGH, almost to American first-floor height.
Tourists crowded every nook and cranny near the city center, so much so I didn’t get inside my favorite bookstore at all: Shakespeare & Co.
Fortunately, I stayed in the relatively tourist-free 15th arrondissement, about four blocks from the Seine, south of the Eiffel Tower and Champs de Mars.
I also got a good taste of what the city is truly like near the Buttes Chaumont.
And, of course, driving from CDG to the center, you can’t miss the concrete block apartment buildings and the banlieues on the way into the city, including Drancy, of ill fame during WWII.
Speaking of the Champs de Mars brought back a memory, one that should have shredded any desire of mine to visit Paris ever again.
It’s one of my most memorable Parisian memories.
Early on a June morning, I left my closet-sized hotel room on the Avenue Emile Deschanel and started toward the Champs de Mars on my way to a two-week cooking class at the Cordon Bleu at its former Rue Léon Delhomme location, “Fish and Their Sauces.” Since it was June, and warm, it only felt right to wear sandals. I’d change into sturdier shoes once I opened my locker at the school. The chefs didn’t allow sandals in the kitchens. And with good reason, given the heavy pots and boiling liquids so easily dropped or spilled.
As usual, I focused my eyes on the architecture looming above me. Rounding a corner near the far end of the park, my right foot forward, I stepped into a steaming pile of fresh dog poop. Creamy, warm, and stinky.
As the feces — likely from one of the pampered poodles of ladies living in the Faubourg Saint Germain area — seeped between each of my five toes, I frantically searched through my purse for some Kleenex. I leaned up against a wall and scraped as much of the goop off as I could.
As I flew through the door at the Cordon Bleu, I barked a terse, de rigueur “Bon jour” to the receptionist and hurried downstairs to the locker room. I ripped off the sandal and thrust my filthy foot into one of the sinks, pumping the soap dispenser like a farmer milking a cow.
With a half dozen paper towels, I managed to dry my foot enough to pull on a sock and the required leather shoe suitable for the kitchen. The left foot, no problem.
As for my sandals, I would never be able to get the subtle stink of dog poop out of the leather straps. I wrapped both sandals in a plastic bag and shoved them into the trash bin. Then I finished dressing in the required uniform, necessary even for short-term students.
I bought another pair of shoes from a street vendor in Montmartre a few days later. However, I never wore sandals again in Paris during any of my many future visits to the city.
Despite efforts to eliminate the French dog poop problem, it persists.
What to do?
Don’t look up before you look down first!

In these times, when supply far exceeds demand, and everyone is creating for the sake of sharing and appreciation, it’s crucial to take a step back, close your eyes, and find new perspectives. Otherwise, you might just end up bored and disinterested, since what you’re doing has probably been done before.
The unpredictable nature of street photography can be liberating, but it can also present a fog of opportunities without clear direction. You wake up in the morning, not knowing what you’ll bring home, which is fine and wonderful. However, there are occasions when having clear guidelines helps, especially when you are in a not-so-familiar place but want to make the most of it.
Living in the Netherlands, reaching the “City of Light” takes about a five-hour drive in an electric car. I’ve visited Paris several times, but this year I combined a weekend of tourism with my passion for street photography. With limited time for both, I needed to be objective.
The solution? To participate in a photography competition with a triptych mindset.

Last year, I was in the mood to read the classics, so I picked up “A Moveable Feast” by Ernest Hemingway:
“A Moveable Feast” is a memoir and a sketchbook of the time when a young and poor Hemingway lived in Paris during the 1920s.
He was a foreign correspondent at the time, and his literary career was just beginning. I hadn’t read anything by Hemingway in many years, and picking up this book reminded me how much I like his writing style.
“A Moveable Feast” is a bit random, as you might expect from a diary-style narration.
Hemingway writes about his relationship with his first wife and the woman he cheated on her with, who later became his second wife (spoiler alert — he had four wives in total).
He also writes about his friendships within the American expat community in the 1920s Paris, including his relationship with Scott Fitzgerald and other writers and artists of that time (spoiler alert — Fitzgerald was an alcoholic).
The book has many interesting moments. For example, Hemingway writes about being poor and constantly hungry in Paris, which was especially hard with all the bakeries and restaurants on the Parisian streets. Apparently, this is why his novels and literary works have a bigger focus on food and drinks.
“A Moveable Feast” is, if I’m not mistaken, the author’s last published work. It’s definitely a good read, full of stories about Paris and getting drunk with famous artists.
Beer of the day is an easy choice — my favorite Blue Moon!
I do repeat this beer quite a lot here, but it always features different surroundings.
This picture is special as it was taken at one of the stalls during the 2024 Edinburgh Fringe festival.
It was our first time experiencing Fringe, and oh me oh my, what an experience! It was truly amazing, and felt like a month-long carnival. I definitely had a post-Fringe blues afterwards.

People will argue with me on this. For many, the race last weekend: Ronde van vlaanderen aka Tour of Flanders is the best race of the season. And indeed, in terms of spectator experience and in terms of cobbled climbs, which separate the gladiators from the men, climbs like the Paterberg, the bone shaking and long Kwaremont and the Koppenberg, it is indeed a great race to watch. Last weekend, it was the legendary Tadej Pogacar dropping his equally legendary rival, Matthieu Van Der Poel on the Kwaremont on their 3rd turn up the hill, to take his 2nd Tour of Flanders win.
But for me, the race that has always fascinated me, has had this weird combination of mystique and fear, has always left me romanticising about cycling is none other than the race I am watching while writing this blog: Paris-Roubaix, often known as the hell of the north.
A bit of cycling context, the most famous race on the cycling calendar is the Tour de France, which is a 3 week long stage race capturing the imagination of everyone who has ever ridden a bike. The stages spanning through beautiful French countrysides, ending in sprints, the battles on the slopes of the Pyrenees and the Alps, it is hard not be romantic about cycling. It evokes the primitive of emotions. It is poetry in motion. There are two other grand tours: Giro D’Italia and Vuelta d’Espana, both of whom hold less prestige than the Tour De France. These are the 3, 3 week stage races. There multiple 2 and 1 week stage races as well and then there are some famous one day races. Out of them, one of the key races has always been the Road World Championships which often happens at the end of the Vuelta, toward September. And then you have the 5 Classics:
If you were wondering if there are any other cyclists other than Pogacar and Van Der Poel, you can be excused. Out of the last 19 Classics, 14 have been won by these two. I am writing this part with 52.5 kilometers to go in today’s race and Pogacar, Van Der Poel and Jasper Philipsen (Winner of 2024 Milan San-Remo and Van Der Poel’s teammate) lead the race by 1'18"".
Simple reason: The drama. Take a look at this picture:
And this:
The start point of Paris-Roubaix is variable, for example, in 2025 it began in Compiègne (Which is a bit outside Paris). But it always end up in the Velodrome of Roubaix, where the riders do 750 meters and often end up in a sprint finish. In 2025, the distance of the race was 259.2 kilometers and it is often in that range and during these kilometers, the riders go through several cobbled sections.
These sections are hundreds of years old and are maintained by “Les amis des Paris-Roubaix”. This group of volunteers, founded by Jean-Claude Vallaeys in 1983 maintain the cobbled sections in their pristine state so that the racers have the same conditions of the cobbles every year. The cobbles, as I mentioned before are the main point of attraction of this race. The sections are graded with stars, with the 1 star sections being the “easiest” and the 5 star sections being the most challenging. There are 3, 5-star cobble sections and the race has 27 cobbled sections in total. The grading is based on the quality of the cobbles and the distance on them.
The most iconic section of the cobbles, pictured above is the Trouée d’Arenberg aka Arenberg Forest. It is 2400 meter section of cobbles, laid down at the time of Napoleon 1. The intensity of these cobbles is mind boggling especially coupled with the fact that the entry to the cobbles was on a downhill section, causing the riders to enter the section at a speed of 60 kmph. (A highly criticised chicane was added in 2024 to reduce the speed of entry). Even so, the Arenberg forest, about 100 kilometers from the finish is the place where the first selection is made from the group of favourites. There are 2 more sectors of the 5 star variety: the 3 km long Mons-en-Pévèle which has 2 right hand turns while climbing steadily and the decisive Carrefour de l’Arbre, which arrives 15 kilometers before the finish line. The 2.1 kilometer section is brutal, winding and with its proximity to the finish is often where the riders make the final attack.
As you can imagine, the race gets intense as the riders jostle with each other to get the best line over the cobbles, the bike shakes and you see bottles and parts fall out. These sections are narrow and if you get a flat, it is in your benefit that you’re in the front and can get a wheel change. If not, you get stuck behind and can lose a lot of time. In the words of a former 2nd place finisher and one of the icons of Paris-Roubaix, George Hincapie: “This is a war, you give them an inch, they will take a mile.” This race gets even more brutal when it rains. In the dry, the riders just inhale the dust of the cobbled sections. In the rain, they get covered in it.
If the selection hasn’t been made in the cobbles and there are still more than 1 riders in contention, the decisive move comes inside the iconic Roubaix Velodrome.
For all the twists and the Machiavellian turns, Paris Roubaix remains the best race in the spring classics for me.
In the words of the most winningest rider of the Paris-Roubaix, Tom Boonen:
The 2025 race was the surprising debut of Tadej Pogacar, who at 65 kilograms is much lighter than most of his rivals, including the pre-race favourite and 2-time defending champion, Matthieu Van Der Poel. Van Der Poel also was aiming to become the 1st man since Francesco Moser (1978, 1979, 1980) to win Paris Roubaix back-to-back, 3 times in a row.
The first selection in the race was made, as expected in the Arenberg forest with a bunch of the pre-race favourites including Wout Van Aert, Mads Pedersen, Pogacar’s teammate’s Nils Politt and Florian Vermeersch, and Van De Poel’s teammate, former 2nd place finisher Jasper Philipsen. Pogacar and Van Der Poel kept launching attacks from 100 kilometers out and it became a real war of attrition. Pogacar, who had already crashed earlier in the day, was almost got taken out by his team car.
With 55 kilometers to go, Pogacar launched an attack which left only Van Der Poel and Philipsen in his wake. As the race proceeded, another attack by Pogacar dropped Philipsen. With 30 kilometers to go, Pogacar took a strong right hand turn but didn’t slow down enough which caused him to crash into the barriers. Van Der Poel maintained a 20"" gap from Pogacar until Pogacar dropped off his bike and took a new bike with 20k to go. The gap grew to over a minute, but in the Carrefour de l’Arbre, it was Van Der Poel’s turn to change bikes. The change came quickly and though he nearly crashed into a barrier, Van Der Poel was never in doubt as he rounded up the Velodrome to take his 3rd Paris Roubaix win. Pogacar finished smiling, content with his 2nd place on his 1st showing here. Behind him, in a sprint Pedersen took the last podium spot, followed by Van Aert and then Vermeersch.
Thank you for reading!

Henry Miller is one dirty cunt. I’ve never read Marquis de Sade but I imagined that Miller to be a modern day Sade, blending all the taboos he can think about (and I can think about) into one novel. Miller is no stranger to being a banned author. Tropic of Cancer was banned in the author’s country of birth until 1961, almost thirty years after it made headways in Paris via the famous publisher Obelisk Press in 1934, where modern day Shakespeare and Co. Bookshop is now.
This is the reason I bought the book in the first place, on an obligatory purchase and visit to the well-renowned bookshop. It took me at least a couple of hours to decide which book to buy from the place. In all honesty, much of the book available on the shelves of Shakespeare and Co. are available in other bookshops and for cheaper. But I’m a bit pretentious at the best of times, so I needed to pick out a book. Henry Miller, who created a career in Paris and owed the city his success was a logical choice. I have not read Miller’s erotica, so why not eh.
When Miller wrote Under the Roofs of Paris (formerly known as Opus Pistorum), he was broke, hungry and would write a dollar a page for this kind of smut. Paris was known for its erotica back in the early twentieth century, its explicit postcards (which also feature prominently in the book) and smut writing was of no place to the conservative American mind at the time. But this sexual liberation was perhaps representative of Paris at the epoch, and it took an American to crystalise that epitome of recklessness.
In the introduction to Delta of Venus, Anaïs Nin spoke about Miller’s venture in writing erotica, that the collector wanted more, that the writers started to exhaust their personal stories and had to look elsewheres. I wonder if Milton Luboviski who commissioned Henry Miller for this was the same collector which demanded Miller to write with less poetry in his smut.
Perhaps not. Because I don’t find much poetry in the book. What we read is explicit sex, sometimes performed by individuals who shouldn’t be having sex. Some of the age is explicit, and the protagonist, Alf, had also indulged in engaging with these minors. I do feel sick at the thought of it and it makes me wonder whether Henry Miller had the same experiences. It would certainly adjust my respect for him as a person.
In the book, our protagonist Alf took part in bukkake-like orgies, a threesome with a midget (which also involves a German shepherd with a generous phallus which I guess makes it a foursome), threesomes with Lesbians, shooting porn, and let’s not talk about his involvement with underaged girls. All these leisurely activities are implemented in an extensive possible combinations of holes, body parts and bodily fluids. This list obviously, is far from exhaustive. Miller writes from experience, and whether some of these had happened to him or his acquaintances, I don’t really know nor do I really want to care.
Yes, I can find traces of Tropic of Cancer here with its crude and detailed description of sex, which makes me doubt if I am adventurous myself in that way. Alf’s organ, John Thursday, is akin to another character that literally always rear its ugly head at the worst (or best) of times. It’s like Alf has a constant walking erection. Alf and John Jeudi seem like different characters, but forever interlinked to one another and dependent on each other’s existence. Come to think of it, all men and their wangs are like that.
After the first hundred pages, the book loses its novelty, which also made me wonder if I had grown up too much to read Henry Miller. In Malay terms, we can say it’s “jelak” which means feeling eugh after having too much of something, usually after you’re halfway through that bowl of Peter’s pork noodles and you regretted getting a large portion instead of small. But comparing Miller’s writing to a bowl of hawker pork noodles is probably not the best idea.
In fact, if I can compare the reading experience with another book, it’d be Bret Easton Ellis’ American Psycho, where the violence felt too much after a while, too caricaturish, far an adaptation of what we know violence to be. The sex in Under the Roofs of Paris is of a similar nature. Never once do I feel the reality of it, however visceral or extreme the nature of it might be.
Now for the million dollar question: as an erotica, did it turn me on? Based on what I mentioned above, no. But there are bits of it that made me raise my eyebrows, and more often than not, bits of it where I’m just shaking my head and saying yeah nah in my head, impatient for the next scene to unravel. I’ve read the book in my commute home in trains and over coffee, but thankful and hopeful that nobody is peering over my shoulder and basking over the gratuitous language.
On a side note, there was also the matter of Billie and Jean, the former more of a lesbian than the latter. Did Michael Jackson steal his most famous song from the characters of Miller’s work? No matter, if it was coincidental, then more power to Henry Miller. Another vignette: the book’s original title, Opus Pistorum literally translates to the work of the miller. Clever cunt, that Henry guy.
— -
On another P.S.S. read this stupendous essay on Henry Miller by Victoria Best, if you really want to dig deep into Henry Miller’s life and his past traumas.

We sat on the steps leading from the Eiffel Tower down to the Seine, surrounded by people of all ages — some walking up and down, others sitting on the edges of the steps or the ledge behind the large platform between staircases. The violinist became more emphatic as he strummed out Imagine Dragons’ “Believer.” I watched a little boy climb the stairs and drop a coin into the black canvas bag the violinist had set in front of his violin case.
After soaking in the music for nearly an hour, we made our way down the second set of steps and over to the first ticket booth. The sun sets late in Paris in June. To capture the views of the city at night, we ordered two tickets for the 9:30 pm boat cruise.
Though the air was cool, the top level of the boat offered the best views. We floated down the Seine, under a bridge, past palaces and museums — the sky still bright above the Roman numerals on the clock of the Musée d’Orsay at 9:45 pm. The Notre Dame loomed on our left — scaffolds crisscrossing behind a massive red and white crane. Restoration from the fire wasn’t due to finish until December.
On our way back to the dock, bridges stood out like charcoal drawings against a pale orange…

I shouldn’t be getting into the habit of enjoying Easter holidays (or any holidays, Christian ones especially) and annual leave just in case I didn’t make it to extend my work visa, but truth be told? I do enjoy holidays as a normal person does and should.
For Easter this year, I went to Paris. When I received the job offer last September, I thought it would be proper that I started visiting some other great museums of ethnology or anthropology, so I could learn for my work. A great example is indeed, the Quai-Branly Museum in Paris, which I had heard several times when I was at school. This museum was definitely on my list of must-visit.
It wouldn’t be my first time to Paris as I went there almost a decade (2015) ago, during which I embarked on a less-than-72-hour marathon of “ticking the tourist’s boxes”: I was in Paris waiting for a flight back to Brno. As a poor student in one of the most expensive cities in the world, I tried to minimse my stay while trying to see EVERYTHING: Louvre? Tick. Château de Versailles? Tick. Champ Élysées? Tick. Eiffel Tower plus climbing it? Double tick.
I was not sure if this time would be better than a marathon, but I was aiming for a rather different route, i.e. another busman’s holiday of museums and histories. Yet, as the title suggest, unfortunately I was sick the whole time. To be specific, the moment I stepped off the Eurostar at Gare du Nord, I immediately realised my Easter holiday was going to be a bit of tumbling along the way.
There are two categories for my visits in Paris: the traditional way and the interactive way. Although the numbers of places in each category seem uneven, I want to bring out the distinction between this post and the next.
I definitely had to put this museum as №1 on my list, as I’m trying to be more prepared for my job at the MAA. I was also guranteed by many colleagues that I “wouldn’t regret”, “a must-see”, and they all left highly possitive comments for this particular museum. I therefore had really high hopes.
I arrived at the museum (with a low fever that was ready to rage in the following four hours) after I visited the Sainte-Chapelle in the morning. The entrance was rather empty, with a ramp that led to the main gallery. There was a large cylindircal space built with glass in the middle of the foyer, which ran through the floors and reached the basement, and through the dark frosty glass, it seemed to be a display gallery as well. (I will come back to this cool space)
Marching along the ramp, there was light and image of water ripples cast by an over-head projector, in hindsight reminding me the ramp of ocean tides that I once walked on in National Museum of Natural Science, Taiwan.
1.1 Oceania
I found myself standing in a tall and wide space, facing towards two galleries: On my right side was Pacific and Oceania; on my left was America. Immediately I was distracted by the large objects near me, which were displayed in a way familiar to me. Many photos of MAA taken by the visitors, no matter how randomly, often feature the large totem pole (1922.265), the slit gong, or the grizzly bear. It doesn’t mean that other collections are unimportant to them, neither does it mean that they learn a lot from these three display, but that they are large enough to be representative of a nice day-out on their photo albums. I am clearly biased for that I see MAA from a behind-the-scene, research-based perspective, and also I know a lot more collections that can be iconic. If I have to choose collections that represent MAA, I probably wouldn’t choose the above three. To me, the first impression of Quai-Branly, also the most impressive collections, could be these large wooden sculptured objects (masks, boards, ceremonial tools), but it may be completely different from what the staff members’ point of view.
Almost as a premonition, I stumbled across these two “boards” in a glass case. I didn’t know that later in April, after I came back from Paris, I would be seeing a large number of Gope boards with a researcher from West Australia. However, looking back the photos I took, I could see that both Quai-Branly and MAA shared a lot of common interest in terms of collecting policy, or put in another way, both museums were formed by early anthropologists who had a close network, who naturally formed the trendy studies of exploring the “unknown pacific islands” then.
I can recognise the very similar motifs of the face mask on the left side: heart-shape nostril, mushroom-shape dome above the head, and two dots, possibly pierced rings for decoration. All are present on the Gope boards I handled in mid-April. However, there are also a lot of features that I didn’t see on this face mask: The chevrons on relief, and the vibrant red, white, and black pigment commonly used. This object is also featured on Google Arts and Culture.

Readers discretion: Please notice that there will be images of HUMAN REMAINS (skulls) below.
Many objects on display reminded me similar collections that I once saw and handled in MAA. Strangely, through this exploration I started appreciating more my work and the reason why anthropology matters: The physical material being preserved acts not only a reminder of the culture that exists (or existed), but also as an evidence that shows that culture constantly evolves, and that artistic choices change all the time. Take the chest ornament above for example. The feathers being a crucial part in Asmat art were incorporated in a contemporary artistic creation. The handbag in MAA inherits the traditional material and presents a new usage, becoming a new tradition for the anthropologists in the next century.
It was at this point when the fever kicked in. I started feeling a cold chill spreading from my lower back, but my face felt so warm and my throat was coarse. I thought, however, that I was simply dehydrated, which was why I persevered.
Remember the huge cylindrical space mentioned before? I reached the end of the Oceania zone and met it again. Seeing through the glass, I saw shelves and storage units stacked neatly, with musical instruments arranged among them. Originally I thought it was a behind-the-scene display, allowing the public to see what a music storage house would look like. The tags on objects made sense. However, I was wrong, at least not entirely wrong. It was an exhibition “Storage of the unspoken” (La reserve de non-dits) by Youmna Saba, who explored the “sonic behaviour” of the ethnographic musical instruments. In the English booklet, I shared the same frustration as the artist explained,
[…] a great enthusiasm, then a lack of breath, before frustration set in. What can an instrument express in a dark glass tower the public only passes by?
The irony of preserving anthropological objects is that the method to extend the life span is exact the same to stifle the purpose of its life. There comes the philosophical question that many face: What use of x, if it can not perform the function when it was created? Does it still count an x? If not, are we simply doing the formality?
www.quaibranly.fr
The paradox is especially apparent on musical instruments, as they should be appreciated with hearing instead of looking. At the MAA, whenever there’s a community person visiting to see their own heritage collections, our policy is that they could choose to handle them with bare hands (without gloves), and it is amazing to see how, for example, musical instruments, sound when they are played. It is very tricky when it comes to wind instruments such as flutes, pipes, and horns, as we are not never sure if they were in contact with historical pesticide, which can make visitors sick. Nevertheless, the spirit is that the museum should be a place where people make the material legacies alive. I would love to know if this large display allowed people to physically handle the collections (it seemed close when I visited). If yes, how would the experience proceed?
At this point, you should find out that I had reached another section, Asia. Seeing the Paiwan ancestor board was really a nice heads-up. Another thing was that my fever was getting worse and I felt even more dehydrated.
!! Notice!!
There might be human remains (ashes) in the collections in the next photo. Readers discretion.
I was thrilled to learn more about shadow puppets from the audio guide. Apparently the fantastic performanceship originated in India, rather than China, which I was told as a kid. The story and the characters indeed changed and evolved as the style migrated and spread among different Asian regions. My first experience with shadow puppets was sorting them from the Skeat collection, which were less elaborate but all the same, impressive (See Z 33667 and Z 33587). I also admire how the Quai-Branly used light box to display the puppets, bringing the colours and crafting details to the eyes.
One can tell that I sped up my visiting pace as I didn’t take that many photos in Asia section.
The monologue I had upon seeing the Benin Bronzes was probably the same when visitors came to the MAA and saw exactly the same display. I have tried to explain to friends that museums simply couldn’t “pack them and ship them back to Nigeria”. If only it were that easy! Shame it’s not wrapping and mailing Christmas gift for Auntie Gladys. The most difficult part is never the practicality of packing and courriering, but the politics and funding that are involved in the repatriation process. Nevertheless, museums are not at liberty to share the details, which are the gap between them and the public.
I was really speeding up my visit without skipping too many collections on display, because my fever was getting a bit out of control. At one point I just felt I couldn’t get up and all I wanted was gulping water. There were at least two school groups at the same time so I used that as an excuse to proceed faster. The royal statue was the last before I moved on to the last section — America.
If I were to commit to a specific area of expertise, the First Nationas people in North America would probably be my second choice, other than East Asia. I know very little about them, but from what I was told and saw, I can relate the history of driving the indigenous people to extinction and how their land and language were taken away.
With a curator like Anita, a lot of research visits at MAA focused on American culture. I am not a stranger to many above. I was especially surprised to see the cape as I was 100% sure there was an identical copy of it in our own gallery, and I also saw the same design on a flyer for the MA Anthropology at Sainsbury’s Centre, UEA. I asked Rachel about it, and she told me that it was a popular design, and that was why it was widely used in woven textiles as gifts.
I spent around four to five hourse in the whole museum, and was absolutely drained when I left the place. I didn’t realise how sick I was until I realised I didn’t even want to shop in the souvenir stores, which I regret because I would love to get a tote bag. I got some flu medicine on my way home.
I had wonderful impression of Quai-Branly. The level and scale are what I envision how a museum of “world anthropology” should be. I still don’t think any museum in the world would be fit for the title “wold anthropology” for a simple reason: All collectors have preferences that are derived from their generations of academic focus, and those preferences are the reason why many museums don’t have the same level of attention on all cultures. Take the zeal for Oceania and Pacific Islands for example, both Quai-Branly and MAA have extensive resources and materials from the region. However, when it comes to Asia, they are usually relatively ignorant. I have to say that I do feel jealous — if that is a fair term to use here — because of my heritage, but I also don’t want to take away people’s attention on any minority groups.
2. Le Louvre, 29 March 2024
As I scrolled through my photo album, I realised that I did not actually like Le Louvre as a museum. If you quickly scroll through this section and compare the amount I wrote about it with Museum d’Orsay (next), you will know which museum I prefer.
My first visit to Le Louvre nine years ago was mainly to tick the box of “see the Mona Lisa (La Joconde)”, which I should say was a half-tick, because I never really saw it in an appropriate distance. My impression for the rest of the galleries was a bit blurred, and this was what I planned to revisit and take a good look.
I couldn’t describe how weird I felt when I stood at the grand foyer, looking at at least three moving escalators extending and ascending to mezzanines. I couldn’t, however, describe why I felt the deju-vu unsettling until I wrote these words down: It was a memory of rushing and running through the corridors, feeling pressed and shame because I couldn’t see the paintings. I have a strange habit: If I don’t get to enjoy a good thing properly the first time, I somehow would avoid coming back and re-enjoy it again. Possibly out of guilt and embarrassment.
I studied the map a little bit and tried to figure out which galleries I possibly had visited before just to avoid them. I didn’t, so I just randomly hopped on one of the escalators and was taken to a broad court full of Roman sculptures. It was a strange space for a brief moment, but in a good sense: The court was quite far away from the early morning crowd who were sprinting towards the Mona Lisa, so I could only hear the low and muffled talking and shouting through the walls. The majority interior design, including the sculptures, was white, reflecting the light and the cloudy sky from a high glassed ceiling. There were only a few visitors and they were sitting on foldable chairs, focusing on their sketches. I guess they were art students. I felt like wondering in a giant bubble in a sci/art-fi movie. In retrospection I am glad that my visit began in a quiet corner instead of another immediate overwhelm.
My strategy for visiting route is wondering and meadering, and avoiding the Mona Lisa at all cost (which is wise for a reason). Overall, I wasn’t impressed by what I saw that day; however, I found something new and it was a nice surprise.
I hope that one day someone could explain to me how or why there is a room full of historical scientific instruments in the Sulley Gallery. For a brief moment I thought I was at the Whipple Museum French Branch, as I could point to every object and name them: Butterfield type sundial, possibly of Augsberg and French made; equinotical ring dial; diptych dial; compendium; astrolabe; compound microscope, etc.. I tried to find more information about provenance and acquisition details but there wasn’t too much about them on the Louvre website. I’m also really intrigued to find out the curatorial reason behind the public display as I don’t think they relate to any other “artistic” collections nearby.
It was wonderful to see the gallery of Egyptian mummies and I vaguely remembered seeing them during the first visit. No surprise, it was fully packed with visitors. I felt a bit uneasy because I thought of the issues of displaying human remains, and all the discussion as a museum professional. Seeing so many visitors still not caring at all about what I thought was strangely unsettling and relaxing: I don’t think museums would ever be able to tell everyone how to behave around human remains, especially something with such high profile. A proportion of visitors will forever remain ignorant and have no regard towards any cultural sensitivity. I’m not saying that museums should stop trying to raise the awareness of respect and privacy, but to forbid a certain approach based on reasons hard to judge, i.e. whether the photos were taken out of despise/entertaiment/respect, is also a restriction of speech and could potentially create another type of dominance.
I don’t think I would want to come back to the Louvre the third time. Aesthetically it is an amazing museum, but I don’t resonate with the collections inside.
3. Musée d’Orsay, 31 March 2024
Before this trip, whenever I mentioned that I had been to Paris (ten years ago, almost), I had to say that I regretted not going to Museum d’Orsay. Yes, I knew it was famous and a must-go, but the decade-ago me was more keen on ticking the bucket list and less a museum person.
One of my colleagues was a passionate advocat of the museum. “Absolutely gorgeous” she said. And I found myself standing under an enormous arc where the train used to stop, now stood stunning marble sculptures.
It was stunning to see all three sculptures (above) displayed ensemble. The clever use of bronze for the sitters’ complexion and the amazing texture of onyx for their outfits really brought out them to life. What’s more interested is the labels: All three sculptures were under different titles once, given by the artist. They were renamed to avoid outdated historical racism.
www.musee-orsay.fr
I am always a fan of watching how the westerners portrait what the world looks like to them. I started paying more attention to this type of creation when I visited the Frederiksborg Castle in Copenhagen, seeing the four corners painted on the ceiling of the Audience Room that depicted the four continents of the globe. I realised how distant it was for the artist to even grasp the concept of what Asia was: The corner painting featured a Turkish man with a turban and a glorious moustache; a camel kneeling beside him.
Contrary to putting a Turk as a representation for Asia, the bronze sculpture in Museum d’Orsay, created in the 19th century, featured a more East-Asian-looking person, possibly because of wars and trade in East Asia. I would say this is how geopolitics are involved in art. On a closer look, as I wrote down this late journal, I noticed that the Asian representation was actually a female (the bossom) with a male braid. How bizzare and intriguing! Was this an intentional decision by the artist? Or was this simply a mixed-up?
A great deal of my visit time was spent in the exhibition Paris 1874: Inventer l’impressionnisme, which in the beginning I didn’t plan to go. However, I couldn’t resist a free exhibition and the fabulous paintings by Monet, plus the queue was not crazy long. In the end, I made the little detour and joined the little crowd (which turned into a massive herd when I left).
I thought it was going to be a “nice and little” exhibition featuring Monet and others (who, unfortunately, I didn’t know. That’s why I only named Monet). Have I been more wrong than this? Probably not. It was an exhibition about impressionism, but it provided a profound historical context on the social change and artistic evolution that led towards the familiar style we know today. There were lots of sketches, photos, and archives that scafolded the beginning of impressionism before I finally saw the Sunrise painting. During the visit I sometimes felt quite embarrassed because I clearly was not up for such in-depth cultural education, especially I was planning on visiting a niche museum later that day.
Every time I see a chinoiserie style in a painting or as an interior design, I always feel surreal. As a child I felt that Eastern elements were strictly limited in Asia, and to see them in a western setting was like seeing an ostrich among chickens — odd and distinctive. Questions like “Did they already know where China and Japan were?”, “have they seen our stuffs already?” and “did they know any Asian person?” will always be in my head. I wonder if it’s the same surreal feeling for a westerner to see late Qing court paintings, which were profoundly influenced by Jesuit missionaries.
That was the last painting I took picture of in the exhibition. It was extremely crowded and noisy so it was a good time to get out of the place.
I became a fan of Cézanne during my teenage time. I appreciate the saturation of colour as well as the clear boundary lines he used.
“Les Âges de l’ouvrier” was a gem among all the artworks that I took picture of. Fédéric was a symbolist painter, which means that his artworks usually contained hints and audience needed to read between the lines. The painting is presented in a triptych, which resembles a traditional religious arrangement. Among the children playing cards (symbolising vice and greed) is a boy, behind who a basket at his head position resembles a saint’s halo.
I finally acscended to the second floor where I was surprised to find a large crowd at the restaurant, and an even larger crowd straining their necks in front of, not just anyone’s, but VAN GOGH’s famous painting of the yellow room. I am never a fan of Van Gogh, so I used this as an excuse and skirted through the gallery.
I was glad to finish my first visit to the Orsay with Monet’s most acclaimed artworks. It was definitely a brief visit, but I made sure I had time to go through all the galleries. If there was any regret, I would say it was that I didn’t get a tote bag (but I bought a T-shirt with Monet’s artwork!).
Overall, I like Museum d’Orsay. It’s incredibly large with amazing artworks; everyone is going to find a piece of art that they like. I appreciate the map and directions that point to the highlight for a quick visit. The audio guide was insightful, though I was hoping for a more flexible touch, such as the one I had in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. The gift shop was nice (I only realised the importance of a good gift shop after this visit and I may come up with a short post about why they are important) but the location was quite awkward.
4. Musée Fragonard, 31 March 2024
I left Museum d’Orsay about two o’clock. Rather early for me; I usually reserve a whole day for just one museum visit. However, I was on a mission to a special museum before I left Paris — Musée Fragonard.
Make no mistake, this is not the Perfume Museum and it has nothing to do with Fragonard the perfumist. I believe that the name Fragonard is a coincident, that this oldest veterinarian school in France happens to have the same name with the perfume brand.
The museum isn’t in the city centre and I had to spend almost an hour from Panthéon (a small detour after Museum d’Orsay) on bus. It was pouring and I felt like the bus was waddling through a sudden flood in Paris, but gladly the tempest died when I finally arrived. I spent some time asking around because I found myself in the middle of a college on a Sunday, when no one stayed in the classroom. Two ladies pointed me the way.
People who know me can always be certain that I’m a big fan of medicla museums. I was definintely gutted to learn later that Musée de l’Histoire de la Médecine was not open due to Easter holiday, but I still had the chance to visit something related — animal anatomy, or vet science.
The Fragonard Museum was definitely a quirky place that can be easily recognised as a university museum: It is tucked away in a humble teaching block; except a few signs and a sleepy security guard 500 meters away, there was no sign to direct the visitors.
I was, nevertheless, amazed by the enlarged teaching models neatly arranged in the display cases. I had never been to a historical vet science museum, so it was a little bit overwhelming at first (especially I only had two hours before the museum closed, and I intended to listen to every.audio.episode.)
Not to sound like a Y2K emo teen but I love anything that associates with death. The rituals that human plan and do in order to mark, remember, relieve, and avoid death are remarkable… They are the last chance for the dead to look back the living world, and the living to forsee what it will be like when we step into the unknown. Object that we study in order to understand death are similar to that. Is this the reason why museums now talk more about resepcting human remains? I wonder; but if bones of human beings are to be treated differently, how come we don’t apply the same attitude towards other animals’ bones? I also think about the lines between collections treated in a scientific and anthropological manner: If a human skull was collected for scientific racism study, it would migrate to repatriation based on anthropological reason. However, animals that sacrifice or were intentinally made ill for scientific purposes were less likely to be treated with anthropological sensitivity.
I wish that there were more textual labels along the display, as the audio guide did not help memorise (it was great content, though, very informative). Or perhaps I just need to find another way to record what I heard on the audio guide.
However, I managed to remember one thing from the audio guide. The pictures above showed the signature on one of the anatomical models, E. Petitcolin, dated 1901. It stands for Eugène Petitcolin, the preparator and model maker of the vet school.
My experience at the Whipple Museum left a valuable lesson in my mind, that all of the great scientific achievement would not have been possible were it not for the tool makers, publishers, etc.. Our education focuses a lot on the theories proposed by the great theoretician and philosophers, but not much time is spent on what compliment their success. Take Auzoux’s papier-mâché human model for example: Hundreds of thousands (an underestimation) of medical students would not have become doctors if there hadn’t been a chance to test their knowledge before practicing on patients. Some of the model makers even took their craftmanship to the next level: Not only were they accurate and precise, but the colour and material made these models, though mass produced, artistic, offering inspiration and perspective on life and the wonder of it.
Petitcolin worked his whole life for the vet school and was a pioneer in model making and preservation. I appreciate how the museum preserved these historical teaching tools, and it was wonderful that he gets to be featured in the tour. I think all museums should, if given chances, reflect upon the assistants and technicians that did the bidding. One example that I feel right is the rooms at the Centre of Material Culture (of MAA), which are named after Clare Isobel Fell (archaeologist, 1912–2002), Samuel Cowles (museum assistant), and Maureen M. O’Reilly (assistant curator), who were women and assistant dedicating their lives to the work, but not necessarily remembered in the history.
However, this is not the highlight of the Fragonard Museum.
! Attention!
The photo below contain human remains. Readers’ discretion advised.
These are écorchées, or the flayed collections. Made by Honoré Fragonard (1732–1799), who used to teach anatomy in the vet school, these are considered the treasures of the museum. The technique that Fragonard employed is still not fully understood. I could see that this was dry specimen, and I assumed that the material involved a lot of wax, hence the shiny gloss on the surface. My impression was proved right when I read later, that these creations were made not based on anatomical studies, but more for a theatrical performance. I definitely felt the intense glare from the first standing man, Goliath. I feel very fortunate that I am not bothered by such beautiful creation because I can imagine many people shying away, and I understand that.
This is probably the longest post I’ve written in English so far. I’ve waited a long time before I even started writing it, and procrastinated several times because life since April has been like being strapped on a rocket while skating on icy road, totally chaotic.
I have a mixture of positive and negative views on Paris as a city and the two visits I’ve made so far. I think it is a wonderful metropolitan: sleek, chic, vibrant, and everyone can have a place; and yet I don’t feel like I can find a place there, just as I feel about London. However, this is not a travel blog.
As for museums, I absolutely give them a five star overall. During this trip, I have ticked more boxes on my bucket list, without loosing the quality and depth that I was looking for. The regret that I didn’t get to visit Museum of the History of Medicine is a strong reason to bring me back to this city.

Paris: where Love, Creativity, and Perfection Converge.
This day one year ago,
we were admiring the perfectly planned lanes of Paris while standing on the famous,
brilliantly marketed,
iconic Eiffel Tower
We watched Paris basking in the golden glow of the setting sun,
and then it all started to twinkle and looked even more beautiful and serene as evening descended.
Damn!
I admired the vision through which the city was planned.
I also read about its history, even though we walked over 15,000 steps a day. Human creativity and vision know no bounds.
At that time, I wasn’t sure if it was pressure, punishment, or reward, but they designed a freakishly beautiful city that endures even after you leave it.
So, as you stroll through the lanes of Paris, it dawns on you that something this grand can be created with stunning detail.
Perfectionism isn’t just a term;
It’s something that can and should be pursued.
If you do so,
you can create something that stands out
and remains eternal
for ages to come.
And even though it’s a big crazy city, with constant traffic and crowded metro rides,
there is love in the air!
There’s something so (geographically!) blessed about the air that it heals you.
You immediately miss someone in Paris and want to return with them. (This could be true for any city in Europe though!)
I met my husband after a month in Paris;
he stayed for two weeks longer than I did.
The first thing I said when he picked me up at the airport was, ‘This air is so healing.’ As the quote says —
“Breathe in Paris, It nourishes the soul” — Victor Hugo
So the air and city itself is enough to fill your heart, and yeah, it leaves a strong impression that you’d wish to witness this grandness again.
“A walk in Paris will provide lessons history, beauty, and in the point of life.
We did talk about history and astonishing beauty,
What is the point of life that you see by looking out from the Eiffel Tower?
One takeaway for me is that boundless creativity and perfection exist.
There is nothing wrong with obsessing over perfection.
You might as well build something resembling Paris!

Revoir Paris | Essay Three
I spent a month in Paris, this time, and could simply be there, live there, and revisit places and experiences that I have loved.
Mostly it didn’t rain.
As the days passed under skies of blue or mother-of-pearl, and I relearned the layout of favorite boulevards and quarters and how to take buses everywhere, and eventually mastered how to make it back to the hotel tucked into a sidestreet without first overshooting the mark, Paris began to feel more familiar than ever it had before.
Perhaps I could finally live there because in previous visits I had ticked the tourist sites off the list, and made the big-ticket historical, artistic, and literary pilgrimages, and thus had no further itch to scratch.
Or perhaps it was because while there I turned seventy (which was the idea) and brought to the adventure a mellowing soul.
I think it was the latter reason, mostly, but also because I had flown to peacetime Paris from a war zone and could remind myself viscerally and experientially of what I know intellectually: that a whole, beckoning world exists that is not at war, and that in the absence of war, life can be brilliant, creative, and happy.
Paris has not always been at peace, of course.
Some people know about the Hundred Years’ War between England and France (1337–1453).
Everyone in the world has heard about the French Revolution (1789–1799) — and some know of the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) and the Paris Commune (1871). [1]
Many people know about the high price in blood paid by the French in WWI; some would argue that this led a still shell-shocked populace to follow WWI hero Philippe Pétain into WWII collaboration with Hitler.
If you notice shrapnel-pockmarked building facades from the Nazi era, or memorial signage on buildings, you will learn of Vichy (French) police roundups of Jews and Gestapo executions of Resistants in the very heart of Paris. [2] & [3]
But on this day especially, the world — my whole world — became a jewel box (the Théâtre du Palais-Royal [4]) nested within a coffer (the Domaine national du Palais-Royal) nested within a treasure chest (the Palais-Royal quarter of the 1st arrondissement).
I paused at the southern entrance to the Jardin du Palais-Royal to admire Paravent Girls [5], an Art Basel Paris bronze installation by Egyptian multimedia artist Ghada Amer [6], and then flânered the lovely garden’s length.
I was on my way to the Théâtre du Palais-Royal to meet my cousin and her husband at a performance of L’extraordinaire Destinée de Sarah Bernhardt:
The stage goddess (b. 1844 — d. 1923) lived a hard-working, celebrated life, [7] and like today’s rock stars and pop divas, toured the world “collecting men and animals, having a baby with a prince. . . and doing it all with extravagance, humor, and unfailing commitment.” [8]
The producers were wise to stage the show in so sumptuous a playhouse! Seated on red velvet — or velour? — inside so gilded and plush a venue, one can’t pretend for a second that one has not come to lose oneself entirely in theatrical magic.
Now it is Saturday night at dusk in sharp weather. Night is rapidly falling as my cousin’s husband, Alain, shepherds us across Place Colette, where a crowd couples-dances en plein air to a live jazz and blues orchestra.
We wait on a curb at a red light in a drizzle. From afar, shimmering ice-blue diamonds jet and spill up and down the height of the Eiffel Tower [9]; the Tuileries’ Roue de Paris (ferris wheel) glitters like a diamond-studded hoop suspended in air.
Alain hails us a cab on Avenue de l’Opéra; the grand thoroughfare pulses with neon signage and street lamps and head and tail lights that shimmer off the wet pavement as if they are sequins and gemstones: rubies, diamonds, emeralds!
A switch flips in my neurocircuitry already buzzing from having been to the theater. But now outside in the dark amid festive crowds, the myriad lights have jolted me even more widely awake and strongly alive.
Sparklers go fizzing and blazing through my arteries. My whole bloodstream effervesces! If I weren’t bundled in a fleece jumper and down vest, my skin would be emitting visible sparks.

When I was in college, I was part of a student organization whose goal is to facilitate the onboarding of international students by organizing meetups, dinners, and events.
I met and spent a lot of time with students from all walks of life. Among them, I found a special connection with French.
This bond wasn’t just about shared interests or hobbies; it went deeper, touching on I believe shared values, philosophies, and outlooks on life.
Something about their simplicity, authenticity, and rawness fascinated me.
I met more than twenty French students in college. Not all at the same time. But I’ve always found myself spending time with them. Hanging out. Going out. Drinking at a local bar. Eating at a Chinese restaurant.
As a matter of fact, my go-to friend group in college consisted of 60% French. I’ve always felt home with them. Always felt happy with them.
It’s funny because a lot of Americans dislike French people as they can come off as rude or uptight. Some even complain about how they reek of cigarettes. I even have friends of mine who had terrible experience when they visited Paris because of these and some say it’s overrated.

And I’m (finally) okay with that.
I’ve done my fair share of traveling — much more than I ever would have thought I would when I was much younger. I’ve been to many more than half of the states in the United States. I have been to Europe a handful of times and have enjoyed the sights and sounds of at least ten countries over there. I’ve been to Canada and Mexico. I’ve been to a significant number of islands in the Caribbean.
Sounds pretty good, if I do say so myself.
It’s just that there has been this one location — this one place — this one dream vacation spot of a lifetime, that has eluded me for lo these many years.
That locale — the stuff of fantasy and romance — is, of course, Paris.
These weren’t postcards from places I had actually seen. Nope, as a child my family’s annual vacation destination was our local zoo.
These were postcards I begged for from friends, family, friends of the family and the family of friends.
Anyone, going anywhere, all I asked was a cool shot of something tourist worthy. For the most part, I was indulged in my requests.

Deliberately choosing to visit France in September — right after the 2024 Olympics turned out to be a great decision for me. The places I visited were less crowded, allowing me to take my time and even meet up with dear friends whom I hadn’t seen in a very long time because we lived on different continents.
I spent the last two days of my delightful trip to France in Paris, savoring delicious French cuisine, visiting iconic landmarks, and immersing myself in the diverse Parisian culture. During my time there, I had the pleasure of meeting up with another dear friend who traveled from Brussels to join me.
One time, we were trying to go to the Arc de Triomphe and we made a wrong turn and ended up taking the metro in the opposite direction of where we were supposed to go. We found ourselves at the final stop of a metro line in a neighborhood on the outskirts of Paris. Despite the unexpected detour, I didn’t worry. My friend and I laughed so hard and took it as part of the adventure…

Paris, the most visited city in the world. There are many popular conceptions of Paris, some positive, others negative. There are those that say Paris is the most beautiful and romantic city on the planet, while others talk about how dirty the streets of Paris are and claim that Parisians are rude and the whole city is overrated. I fall more in the middle, leaning to the positive side. I think Paris is an amazing place, though it’s not my favorite in the world.
When I left the Paris-Nord train station, after taking a train from London that went through the English Channel, I immediately noticed major differences in mannerisms and behavior of the French compared to the English.
Although England is technically a foreign country, as an American it didn’t feel too different from the United States. Sure, the English speak in a different accent and use different phrases, but the common language and the cultural similarities made me feel like I wasn’t in a foreign land, even though I was.
When I was in France, however, I truly did feel that I was in foreign territory. One of the first things I noticed when I got out of the train station was that almost everyone was smoking cigarettes. The French also talked faster, and, from my experiences, had a different idea of personal space (not that it’s always a bad thing).

toThe term ‘Paris Syndrome’ was created in 1986 by professor Professor Hiroaki Ota. He explained it as ‘a severe shock that can require hospitalisation’.
Wait, there’s more.
According to this article from Huffington Post,
“The Japanese Embassy in Paris now has a 24-hour hotline for Japanese tourists suffering from the syndrome, whose symptoms can range from depression and anxiety to acute delusional states, dizziness, sweating, hallucinations and “feelings of persecution.”
The reason?
According to professor Mathieu Deflem from the University of South Carolina, it’s because of drastically different cultures and ‘unmet romantic expectations’.
I even have friends who’ve told me that they were disappointed in Paris, but here’s why I still love the city.
My first experience in Paris was when I was 21. My uncle and I were travelling to Paris and Milan, but I arrived a day early and was alone in Paris for the day.
What happened next was an incident that changed my life forever.
Going to cut the long story short.
I met a Syrian man via Couchsurfing. We met at the banks of the river La Seine where the locals were chilling. We just looked at the river and spoke. Between us was his airbag with local cheese, wine, homemade beetroot and classic hummus and pita bread.
He was a journalist and told me how he’s lost his home and a lot of his family.
In the middle of talking about the refugee incidents he has experienced and covered at work, what struck me was this particular sentence,
“You think your life is hard? Think about sitting in a boat and not knowing if you’ll ever see land again. Do this for days, and that life is hard.”
It changed my perspective on everything.
Here’s a detailed article about it if you want to read it later.
Even back then, there were certain challenges.
The menu was entirely in French. People wouldn’t respond in English. But you know what? I don’t see an issue with it.
I’m from India. And it’s painful to see how talking in English is a way of social stratification today. You’re automatically ‘cool’ and ‘well educated’ if you can talk fluently in English.
I mean… this is like Stockholm Syndrome.
When I visited Edinburgh Castle in Scotland, I saw how most jewels there belonged to the kings and queens of India. We were looted and ripped off so bad that we’re relatively poor even today. Yet, we cannot get out of our colonisation by pitting against each other.
The world doesn’t need to be fluent in English.
And here’s a trick that works if you really want the French to be nice to you.
Something that amused me was — each time I spoke in broken French, I got answers in fluent English.
But when I spoke in English, I just got cold nods.
It’s funny, but it underlines how showing a little bit of respect that you’re at least trying to talk in their language warms their heart. Warms mine too, when I see a foreigner speaking in Hindi.
Just saying ‘Bonjour’ can help.
Like everything else, it’s always the little things, isn’t it?
Another thing that helps regardless of the city is to be a traveler instead of a tourist.
Ditch tours, hop-in-hop-off, and the big shiny spots.
Walk into lanes of Montmartre, eat local breakfast, and let go of expensive tickets for the Eiffel view because the view is best enjoyed for free… by the river.
My mum and I visited Paris this August and sat here with some rosé and snacks and had a beautiful time watching the Eiffel light up at night. We also witnessed two proposals!
You don’t see this stuff paying 300 euros for an ‘Eiffel view’ table.
Talking about food, ditch your Instagram famous cafes.
I promise you, the bread you eat at a local boulangerie would be to die for. It’ll be fresh, soulful, and unlike any bread you’ve ever had.
I went to the famous cafe, Ladurée, and ordered eggs benedict. I paid 3.5 euros extra for spinach. Do you know what I got? Two brioches with a diameter of 2 cm and one small leaf of spinach on each.
It was such a tiny meal!
Meanwhile, here’s a local breakfast at a cafe:
France has made me fall in love with breads so much that I tried to find local bread in the 5 other countries I visited during my trip in August.
It’s worth the hype.
Paris is notorious for thefts and being unsafe. But each place has a reputation and as somebody who has solo travelled, I recommend you to follow the basics that you would anywhere else:
I’d follow this in Amsterdam, Berlin, and Melbourne too.
Doesn’t matter where you go, but being responsible for your own safety is better than being sorry later and blaming others.
Lastly, I’d like to end by — give everything a chance instead of dwelling on preconceived notions.
My biggest lesson while solo travelling at 21 was to view the world as a blank slate and let experiences fill in the colour.
I met a woman at a bus stop in Stockholm, Sweden. She was American-Chinese and first asked me if I’ll be ‘allowed’ to wear the dress I was wearing right now in India. I affirmed that obviously, I am. Why would I not be?
She told me that she’s always wanted to visit India, but it’s portrayed as being unsafe.
I swear, if you follow some protocols, it’s not unsafe at all. But if you do things which as a local even I won’t do, then it’s inviting trouble.
Paris is still romantic for couples and lovely for a family holiday. The people are warm, and the bread is even warmer.
Yes, some streets are dirty. But I’ve heard the same goes for New York and San Francisco.
Hop on to the other side, Champs-Élysées is so gorgeous.
Give places and people a chance. Don’t let media or a few bitter experiences fill your head.
Finally, try to explore like a local. That’s what differentiates tourists from travellers, in my opinion.

I have been living in Paris for two years. As I moved from the end of my studies to the beginning of my career, I was able to meet Parisians of all ages.
I saw the Eiffel Tower every day on my morning bus ride to work. Even if I should have been used to the scenery after living there for so long, I never did. The Eiffel Tower is as beautiful as the day I arrived here. Many foreigners dream of living in the world’s most visited and romanticized city. On the other hand, so many tourists express their disappointment once they arrive in Paris. In France, Parisians have a bad reputation for being…rude. But what’s the reality? What’s the real Paris like? What’s romantic about the city, and what’s disappointing?
My first moment of happiness of the day is when I leave the house to go to work. At this time, the sun isn’t even up yet.
Parisian streetlamps light up the city, and there’s no one in sight besides me and the garbage collectors who are starting their day of work. Even with the garbage trucks passing by in the early morning, I consider it breathtakingly calm compared to Paris in the daytime…

Paris is the city of the dead.Spirits sprout in spring from tombstone-houses,bland as dogwood blossoms, drifting likepunch-drunk dandelions in their linens.
The limestone here that every street is lined withreminds me of the gaping quarry holesback home, like long forgotten mossy molars.But mostly they remind me of the flower-painted graves on Independence Day.
Now I understand why it’s so lovely here — why folks who worship Antoinette and prayto posters portraying Van Gogh’s madness wantto gamble off their lives and die in Paris.
One day when some other life flies byto see what wreck we’ve made of this fine Earth,out of all the cities strung acrossthe seven continents, they’ll say that Parishas to be the place we made our stand — where we realized it was over, and wherewe buried ourselves, our hopes, and our dreams.And isn’t that a work of art worth dying for?
Meanwhile, the immortal garçons will smokememorial pillars made of phoenix feathersoutside of Le Café des Musées of Us,looking so distracted, but waiting forsome other sainted tourist to pierce the skyand settle down outside to waste their time.

“Paris is more than a beautiful city… it’s a story.” Chills. When our tour guide shared that, in response to why he will never leave Paris, I knew I’d always remember that sentence. You always hear “Paris is the city of love” — but I like his definition better. It truly is a story.
We spent 4 days in Paris + it wasn’t nearly enough. But it was enough to make me fall in love with the city, + desire to go back for 1 month [at least!] to explore every single district [arrondissement] of Paris. They all have such unique characteristics — check out this post on the vibe of the different districts.
If I were to do it over again, I would have mapped out our days to encompass 1–3 districts every day… *including* a walking tour [if possible!], so that I would be able to get to know as many districts as possible. There’s so much to see! I labeled the districts, so it would be easy for you to see what’s closest to you!
#1] Noir: Hands down the best coffee shop we went to. [8]
#2] Leandres: Loved the vibe of this cafe… so cute! It was also next to an Acai & You, so you can grab coffee + then an acai bowl! [9]
#3] The Cafeotheque Of Paris: Apparently this coffee shop started the “artisan coffee movement” in Paris. It had so, so many options [one of the only cafes that had iced coffee that we saw]. Grab a coffee to go + the head across the river to Ile Saint-Louis to wander the streets… such a cute little area! [4]
#4] Le Peloton: Cute coffee shop in my fav neighborhood hat also offers bike rentals, + does bike tours! Close by is a popsicle shop, La Paleteria that I loved. [4]
#5] Cafe De Flore: The most famous French cafe in Paris. We didn’t go, but wanted to include this as it’s one of the oldest coffee shops in Paris, well known for being the “hang out spot” for high profile writers, philosophers, + creatives of the time. Visit for the history + fun for people watching. [6] *Other “famous” Paris spots are Laduree [macroons] + Angelina [hot chocolate]
#6] Partage Cafe: We stopped in here on our way to the Eiffel Tower to grab a quick bite + coffee, + it was the perfect treat. [15]
#7] … honestly go into any bakery ; ). Get a croissant, baguette, quiche, or whatever looks good to you! There are so many incredible bakeries — on every corner!
For next time: Fresh Bagel + Juice [11], Acai & You [9 + 11], Jozi Cafe [5], Good News Coffee Shop [15], Zia [7], Soul Kitchen [18], Bleu Olive [7], Fringe [3], Komborebi [9], Grainette [9]
#1] Terra: Our favorite meal in Paris! Beautiful space + amazing grilled meal. All of their entrees are for two people to share![3]
#2] Marso & Co: Loved this trendy mediterranean restaurant, + the owner Ludo was *so* nice. So many incredible flavors. [13]
#3] Ya Bayte by Hebe: Lebanese takeaway restaurant. Go here for lunch + then sit on the river! [5]
#4] Veggie Tasty: Vegan bowls + wraps. Great if you are in the area + want something healthy + tasty! [9]
#5] Les Epiciers: Loved this wine + cheese bar! One of the best chaucerte spreads I’ve ever had — with *warm* bread! YUM. [3]
For next time: Ev Brochettes + Mezzes [5], Green Deli [5], Balls [11], Today Tomorrow [Vegan, 11], B.BETTER [Vegan, 4], Numero 220 [Veg, 5], L’en K [5], Sol Semilla [Vegan, 10], Chantoiseau [18], Restaurant CHANG [1]
#1] My new fav french word is flâner — meaning “to stroll”, get lost + wander around for the sake of simply enjoyment. This is essential to do in Paris!
#2] Siam Spa [14]: Loved this thai massage spa! I also really wanted to check out Spa & Hammam [5], it’s a spa + tea house just for women!
#3] Picnic in all the gardens + parks. Need I say more ; )
#4] Go on biking tour! We absolutely loved our biking tour — Paris’ Best Kept Secret. Highly recommend!
#5] Something to note — boutique fitness studios are hard to come by + apparently crazy expensive. One of our friends lives in Paris + that’s what she said!
#1] Eiffel Tower — obviously! Make it your first + last stop if you can! Try to see it at night when she sparkles : )
#2] Walk to the highest point of Paris, Saint-Pierre De Montmartre church at sunrise or sunset. On your way, check out the Wall Of Love — “I love you” is written in 250+ languages!
#3] Walk down every single street in Marais. This was my favorite district of Paris… so trendy, romantic, + tons of amazing boutiques/eats!
#4] Visit the Catacombs — get a ticket online prior to going!
#5] If you can make a trip to Versailles +/or Monet’s Garden… do it! Both are outside Paris, but absolutely incredible to see [+ relatively close!].
#5] Tours on tours on tours! Google “walking tours” in Paris based on what you what to see… you’ll be guaranteed to find plenty! Airbnb Experience also has a lot of fun tours.
#6] See how many of these 50 sites you can visit ; )
We stayed at Hotel Henriette, which was absolutely adorable + had great breakfast — but, if was far from our favorite areas]. It was close to the Latin Quarter though! Next time, I’d want to stay in Marais — just because that was my fav district!
#1] Don’t expect people to speak English. Download a tanslator app on your phone! I used the Google Translate app.
#2] Use public transportation! It’s so easy, + will take a lot less time than ubers/taxies [+ cheaper!] train.
#3] Check out HiP Paris — I loved exploring this blog all about Paris!
#4] Watch Midnight In Paris to get you in the mood prior to going [or during your trip!]. Such a feel good movie! + love seeing all the sites!
#5] Are any of these absolute musts? No! [Okay, other than Eiffel Tower lol that is a must in my book!] This is the first time I’ve probably said this in a wellness guide but it’s true… there’s *so* much to see in Paris + so many incredible spots. It really just depends on what area you are in!
Ugh, Paris is so alive + I LOVE IT! I’m ready to go back now! Did I miss any of your fav spots? Let me know!
xx

I recently returned from a two-week trip to Europe, and I obviously spent a lot of time observing pedestrian and bicycle culture and infrastructure. Rather than simply envy our neighbors across the pond for their walkable and bike-friendly cities and believe that we Yanks could never match their high active transportation mode shares, I was constantly thinking how I could translate my experiences and observations into on-the-ground change here in the U.S. I also realized that we have some progressive transportation infrastructure on our own soil to be proud of.
We first made the pilgrimage to Copenhagen — the Promised Land for many Americans in the bicycle/pedestrian profession… And it lived up to the hype! The comprehensive network of physically separated cycle tracks was incredible and refreshing, of course, but I was more impressed by how easy it was to walk around the city. Several of the major streets were actually pedestrianized, with motor vehicles prohibited. While some examples of this concept exist in the U.S. — including Santa Monica’s Third Street Promenade — they feel rather manufactured and not organic.
Even with the dreary weather, we were sad to leave the playground of Copenhagen. But Paris was awaiting us! I had a mental image of Paris as the small, charming town along the river that is shown in films and travel magazines. However, I was immediately made aware of the city’s sprawling size and wide, auto-clogged boulevards. In a way, I was reminded of my hometown of Los Angeles, except that Paris’s Metro system blankets the region. In a flip from my experience in Copenhagen, I had gone to Paris expecting a walker’s paradise, but instead saw a budding cycling haven. The city had already squeezed cycle tracks along many of the major boulevards, and the famous Vélib’ public bicycles were as common a sight as sidewalk cafés and baguettes. The bicycle network appears set up to help Parisians close the “first mile/last mile gap” that often exists in a trip using public transit. I would love to see Los Angeles and other U.S. cities with mass transit networks pursue a similar course.
Finally, we ended our vacation by hanging out in the pedestrian paradises that are old Spanish cities. Barcelona, our first stop, was seemingly built to make walking a pleasurable experience, with interesting side streets, promenades, and commercial districts around every corner. Barcelona and other Spanish cities like Granada and Toledo also make good use of shared streets, or woonerfs, to make streets safe in constrained neighborhoods.
Finally, the many plazas and parklets in Spain’s cities were a never-ending source of resting space and excellent people watching.
Although very different in many ways, Los Angeles can and should follow the lead of European cities by creating safe and pleasurable spaces for people to walk or bike and be outside enjoying our near-perfect weather. And I’m proud to say that the LA region is beginning to seriously take on that mission. Both Long Beach and Temple City now have cycle tracks. LA County Metro is planning a regional bike share program. And through the LA Department of Transportation’s People St. program, several plazas and parklets have been created or are planned for previously underused road space. I’m excited that our leaders are beginning to push for progressive changes to restore some balance to how we move around our own cities.

Paris is, perhaps, the most beautiful city in the world. This might seem almost too obvious to write given how widely acknowledged and thoroughly documented its beauty is. On one hand, that’s fair. It’s a magnificent city that enjoys near unanimous admiration from around the globe. More than 44 million people visited Paris in 2022, with nearly 20 million of those tourists coming from outside of France. Depending on what data you look at, this would be good for the 3rd or 4th most visited city in the world by international tourists. For those who aren’t able to make the journey to Paris, images of the city are seared into the minds of most people from an early age, serving as the de facto model of what a wonderful city should look like. Its bistros, baked goods, and culture have been exported world wide.
But you’ll have to excuse my writing out the obvious, and walking down already well trodden paths to explain the beauty of Paris, as I believe it extends far beyond what we’ve been told of it, or shown. I’d like to argue that Paris isn’t properly appreciated for all that it is, and I doubt that it ever could be. You might say this is just excitement talking, and that’s partly true — I’m still glowing from my recent quick trip…

Helping You Adapt to Life in France

Some months ago, at the height of the transportation strikes, several well-meaning acquaintances messaged me with concern or asked on behalf of friends who were considering travel plans whether it was indeed safe to visit Paris.
These people didn’t need a speech from me, I thought. My safest answer was, “Yes; don’t believe everything you hear from the mainstream media, whose business is built on chaos.”
But by the third time I was asked, I blurted out, “The people asking this live in the country which must be the most dangerous one for children in the entire developed world.” My fellow Americans, blissfully self-absorbed and aloof from the world, wonder if it’s safe to travel to Paris, which was dealing with strikes and riots (nothing new, something I’ve experienced regularly since moving to France). Yet in America, children are regularly gunned down in classrooms and people are choked to death on subways or on routine traffic stops. Those things don’t happen in France.
My unsafe answer concluded, “It’s certainly safer to visit France than an American elementary school.”
Do the trite words of “Thoughts and prayers,” which automatically and thoughtlessly escape the lips of many of my fellow countrymen after every tragedy simultaneously obliterate their common sense to such a degree that they consider the glossy…

Paris! The city of lights, love, and a maze of delectable experiences just waiting to be discovered It’s a place where every cobblestone street tells a story of history, every café smells like freshly brewed coffee, and every corner reveals an architectural marvel that takes your breath away. This is a living, breathing work of art, not just a city. But don’t get carried away by Paris’ poetic allure just yet. We’re all here for a reason, aren’t we?
My fellow globetrotters, the goal of this blog post is to provide you with the best tips and tricks for exploring Paris like a seasoned traveler. Not the kind that just takes a selfie with the Eiffel Tower and leaves, but the kind that delves deep into the city’s soul, savors its flavors, and emerges with a heart full of stories.
“Why should I trust this guide?” you may be wondering. So, please allow me to introduce myself. I’m your friendly neighborhood world traveler, a culture connoisseur, a gastronome of global cuisines, and an adventurer who’s walked on every continent. I’ve had tea with Bedouins in the Sahara, tango danced in Buenos Aires, and hiked the Great Wall of China. But no matter where I go, I am always drawn back to Paris.
So strap in, because we’re about to take a virtual stroll through the streets of Paris. We’ll navigate the city’s intricate metro system, discover hidden gems tucked away in charming neighborhoods, savor the finest French cuisine, and even pick up a few etiquette tips. You’ll be ready to pack your bags and book your next flight to Paris by the end of this guide.
But keep in mind that this isn’t just about checking off items on a tourist checklist. It’s all about immersing yourself in the Parisian way of life, getting to know the city’s rhythm, and making memories to last a lifetime. So, are you ready to discover Paris’s wonders? Let’s get this party started!
Oh, the trip to Paris! It’s the first step in your epic journey, and it’s just as important as the destination. There are now several ways to get to the city of lights, each with its own unique charm and quirks. Let’s get into the specifics, shall we?
Flights are the most common mode of international transportation. Paris has two major airports: Charles de Gaulle, a bustling hub that welcomes flights from all over the world, and Orly, a quieter sibling that’s popular with European travelers. Here’s a pro tip from a seasoned traveler: If you’re flying from outside Europe, you’ll most likely land at Charles de Gaulle. However, if you need to connect within Europe, try to book it through Orly. It’s smaller, less crowded, and has a charm that larger airports frequently lack.
For those traveling within Europe, trains are the preferred mode of transportation. The French rail network is an engineering marvel, connecting Paris to major cities throughout the continent. Isn’t there something magical about sipping a cup of coffee while watching the French countryside fly by? If you’re in a hurry, take the TGV, France’s high-speed train, and you’ll be in Paris in no time.
Let us now discuss transactions. The golden rule of travel is to plan ahead. The earlier you book, the better the bargains. But here’s a secret: the best deals are sometimes found at the most unexpected times. Late-night flights, mid-week trains, and off-season seasons are your allies. Accept them, and your bank account will thank you.
Finally, keep in mind to check multiple booking platforms. Each has its own set of deals and discounts, and a little digging can go a long way. Skyscanner and Kayak are excellent flight search engines, while Trainline and SNCF are excellent train search engines.
That’s all there is to it. The journey to Paris, explained Remember that whether you choose to fly through the clouds or race across the countryside, the journey is just as important as the destination. After all, as the saying goes, a trip to Paris is always a good idea!
The sweet quandary of deciding where to hang your hat in Paris The city is teeming with lodgings of all kinds, each offering a distinct slice of Parisian life. But don’t worry, I’m here to help you navigate the maze of Parisian accommodations, from the grandest hotels to the coziest apartments.
Let’s start with the best of the best: the hotels. Some of the world’s most luxurious hotels can be found in Paris. Consider this: You’re relaxing in a luxurious suite with a view of the Seine, sipping champagne as the Eiffel Tower twinkles in the distance. Doesn’t it sound lovely? That is the allure of Parisian hotels. They are more than just places to sleep; they are experiences in and of themselves. The Ritz, the George V, and the Shangri-La are all names synonymous with luxury and opulence. But keep in mind that luxury comes at a cost. If you’re willing to splurge, these hotels provide an experience that is well worth the money.
But what if you’re looking for something a little less expensive? Enter hostels and low-cost hotels. These are the unsung heroes of Paris lodging. They may not provide champagne or river views, but they do provide something far more valuable: the opportunity to meet other travelers. Parisian hostels are known for their lively atmospheres and welcoming staff. They are places where you can share travel stories over a communal dinner, explore the city with new friends, and live like a local. What’s more, what’s the best part? They’re also inexpensive.
Apartments are now the way to go if you value privacy and want to live like a true Parisian. Paris is full of charming apartments that you can rent for your stay. Imagine waking up in your own Parisian apartment, brewing a cup of coffee in the kitchen, and watching the city come to life from your balcony. It’s a different kind of luxury, allowing you to explore the city on your own terms.
Let us now discuss location. Paris is divided into 20 districts, or arrondissements, each with its own distinct personality. The city’s heart, the 1st arrondissement, is home to iconic landmarks such as the Louvre and the Tuileries Garden. This is the place to be if you want to be right in the middle of things. If you prefer a quieter, more local atmosphere, head to the outer arrondissements. For example, the 20th arrondissement is known for its bohemian vibe and vibrant street art.
The price range is entirely dependent on what you’re looking for. A night in a luxury hotel can cost several hundred euros, whereas a bed in a hostel dorm can cost as little as 20 euros. Apartments fall somewhere in the middle, with prices varying according to size and location. My recommendation? Make and stick to a budget. In Paris, there is accommodation for every budget; you just need to find the one that is right for you.
So, my fellow travelers, there you have it. The decoded world of Parisian lodging Whether you choose to live in luxury, embrace the communal spirit of hostels, or appreciate the privacy of an apartment, keep in mind that your lodging is more than just a place to sleep. It’s your Parisian home, where you’ll unwind after a day of exploring, share meals with new friends, and fantasize about the adventures that await. If you make the right choice, your Parisian home will become a treasured part of your travel memories.
Getting around Paris, my friends, is an adventure in and of itself. The city’s public transportation system is intricately woven and connects every corner of the city, much like a giant spider web. It’s an architectural marvel, a testament to the city’s dedication to accessibility, and, if I may add, a joy to use.
Let us begin with the Metro, the backbone of Parisian public transportation. The Paris Metro is more than just a transportation system; it’s a part of the city’s identity, with its unmistakable Art Nouveau entrances and labyrinthine network of tunnels. It’s quick, efficient, and surprisingly simple to use once you get the hang of it. Each line is identified by a number and a color, with the name of the last station on the line indicating the direction of travel. So get a map, plan your route, and you’ll be zipping around town like a local in no time.
Then there are buses. While the Metro transports you underground, buses allow you to explore the city on the ground floor. They are slower than the Metro, but they provide a scenic route through the city. They’re also an excellent way to discover lesser-known neighborhoods and landmarks. Just remember to double-check the bus routes and schedules before boarding.
Then there are the bicycles. With dedicated bike lanes and bike-sharing programs like Vélib’, Paris is a bike-friendly city. Cycling through the city with the wind in your hair and the cityscape unfolding around you is incredibly liberating. It’s an experience I wholeheartedly recommend.
Now, for some pointers on how to get around efficiently, Get a Navigo card first. It is a reloadable card that can be used on the Metro, buses, and some Vélib’ stations. It will save you the trouble of purchasing tickets each time you travel. Second, if possible, avoid rush hour. During peak hours, the Metro and buses can become congested, so plan your journey accordingly. Finally, don’t be afraid to take a walk. Paris is a walkable city, and it is sometimes the best way to explore it.
That’s all there is to it. The ins and outs of getting around Paris Whether you travel by Metro, bus, bike, or on your own two feet, keep in mind that the journey is just as important as the destination. So, take your time, take in the sights, and let the city lead the way.
Paris, the city of love and lights, is a treasure trove of iconic attractions that have captivated travelers’ hearts for centuries. Each monument, each landmark, tells a story — a quintessentially Parisian story of history, art, and culture. Let’s take a tour of these must-see attractions, shall we?
The Eiffel Tower, or La Dame de Fer (The Iron Lady), as the French call it, is the symbol of Paris. With a height of 330 meters, this iron lattice tower provides a breathtaking panoramic view of the city. The Eiffel Tower is a sight to behold at any time of day, whether you choose to climb to the top or admire it from the ground. But there’s something magical about seeing it twinkle against the night sky, in my opinion.
The Louvre, the world’s largest art museum and a historic monument in Paris, is next on our list. It’s an art and history treasure trove, housing thousands of works from all over the world, including the enigmatic Mona Lisa. Walking through the Louvre is a journey through the annals of human civilization that is both enlightening and awe-inspiring.
The Notre-Dame Cathedral stands on an island in the Seine, not far from the Louvre. This French Gothic architectural masterpiece bears witness to the city’s rich religious history. Its intricate facades, towering spires, and breathtaking stained glass windows are breathtaking. And if you don’t mind a bit of a climb, the view from the top is well worth it.
Let us now discuss how to make the most of your visit to these top attractions. The key is to plan ahead. These attractions are popular for a reason, and they can become congested, particularly during peak tourist season. So, here are a few pointers to help you avoid the crowds and have a good time during your visit.
To begin, go early in the morning or late in the afternoon when there are fewer people. You’ll not only avoid the crowds, but you’ll also get to see these sights in a new light. Consider watching the sunrise from the top of the Eiffel Tower or admiring the Louvre’s glass pyramid as the sun sets. Doesn’t it sound lovely?
Second, consider purchasing tickets ahead of time. Many of these attractions provide online ticketing, which can save you a significant amount of time. Some even sell “skip-the-line” tickets that allow you to avoid the long lines.
Finally, take your time. These attractions are full of detail and history, and rushing through them would be a waste of time. Take your time, take in the details, and let the beauty of these sights wash over you.
So, fellow travelers, these are the top Paris attractions. They’re more than just sights to see; they’re experiences to cherish and memories to create. So pack your bags, put on your walking shoes, and prepare to discover the wonders of Paris. Best wishes!
Paris, the City of Lights, is a treasure trove of previously unknown treasures. Aside from the iconic Eiffel Tower and the magnificence of the Louvre, there is a world of lesser-known attractions that offer a truly unique and authentic Parisian experience. Let’s go on an off-the-beaten-path adventure, shall we?
The Père Lachaise Cemetery is in the 20th arrondissement of Paris. You might be wondering right now, “Is it a graveyard? Really?” But believe me when I say this isn’t your average cemetery. It’s a peaceful haven in the heart of the city, where history and peace coexist. Here, you can pay your respects to famous people such as Oscar Wilde and Edith Piaf while also getting lost in the maze of cobblestone paths and ancient tombs.
Next, let’s visit the city’s thriving street art scene in the 13th arrondissement. Local and international artists turn the streets into an open-air museum by painting on them. Don’t miss the BnF François-Mitterrand, which features stunning murals on its towering walls.
If you enjoy literature, go to Shakespeare and Company in the 5th arrondissement. This charming bookstore has been a haven for writers and book lovers since the 1950s. Browse the book shelves, go to a reading, or simply enjoy the literary atmosphere.
How do you go about discovering these buried treasures? The key is to keep an open mind and a keen eye. Don’t be afraid to deviate from the tourist trail and explore the city’s lesser-known neighborhoods. Insider information is best obtained from locals. Use social media and travel blogs to find recommendations. Above all, be open to the element of surprise. Some of the most fascinating discoveries occur when you least expect them.
Remember that finding these hidden treasures isn’t about crossing things off a list. It’s about being present in the moment, whether it’s the peaceful solitude of a cemetery, the vibrant colors of street art, or the cozy comfort of a bookstore. Allow the city to reveal its secrets to you as you take your time and enjoy the moment.
So, fellow travelers, are you ready to unearth Paris’s hidden treasures? The city awaits you, full of surprises and stories to discover. Have a great time exploring!
Paris, the world’s gastronomic capital, is a food and drink lover’s paradise. The city’s culinary scene is a delectable symphony of flavors that is as diverse as it is delicious. French cuisine is a culinary journey that will tantalize your taste buds, from the humble baguette to the decadent escargot.
Let’s start with the fundamentals, the foundation of French cuisine: bread. Bread is more than just food in Paris; it’s a way of life. The baguette, with its golden crust and soft interior, is a Parisian household staple. Combine it with some cheese for a simple yet satisfying meal. Not to mention the croissant, a buttery, flaky delight that goes perfectly with a cup of coffee.
When it comes to coffee, Parisians take it seriously. Coffee is an essential part of Parisian culture, whether it’s a quick espresso at the counter or a leisurely café crème at a sidewalk café. A hot chocolate at Angelina is also a must for those with a sweet tooth. It’s a chocolate lover’s dream come true — thick, creamy, and decadently rich.
Let us now explore the world of French cuisine. Escargot, foie gras, and coq au vin are just a few of the dishes that have put French cuisine on the map around the world. But French cuisine is more than just these classics. Each region and city has its own specialty. The steak-frites, a simple dish of steak and fries, is a testament to the culinary philosophy of Paris: quality ingredients cooked to perfection.
There’s also the wine. France is one of the world’s largest wine producers, and Paris is the ideal location to sample the country’s extensive wine selection. There is a wine for every palate, from the full-bodied reds of Bordeaux to the crisp whites of the Loire Valley.
So, where should you eat and drink in Paris? The city is teeming with cafes, restaurants, and bars, each with their own distinct charm and personality. Café de Flore in Saint-Germain-des-Prés offers a classic Parisian café experience. If you’re looking for a gourmet meal, Le Comptoir du Relais has a delectable menu of French classics. A visit to Le Baron Rouge wine bar is also recommended for wine enthusiasts.
But keep in mind that the best culinary experiences are frequently found in the most unexpected places. That little bakery might just have the best baguette you’ve ever had. That tiny bistro around the corner may have the best coq au vin. So don’t be afraid to venture out and try new things.
Finally, some words of wisdom. The experience of French cuisine is more than just the food and drink. It’s about the pleasure of sharing a meal, the art of conversation, and the pleasure of savoring each bite. So, when you’re in Paris, eat like a local. Take your time, enjoy the food, and let the culinary magic of the city enchant you.
Are you ready to embark on a culinary adventure in Paris, my fellow travelers? The city’s cafes, restaurants, and bars are waiting to tempt your taste buds and fill your heart with gastronomic delight.
When you enter Paris, you are not simply entering a city; you are entering a rich tapestry of culture and tradition that has been woven over centuries. The French, particularly Parisians, are known for their strict sense of etiquette and customs. Understanding these nuances will enhance your experience and enable you to navigate the city like a local.
Let us begin with greetings. The French are formal in their interactions, and it is customary to greet people with “Bonjour” (Good day) during the day or “Bonsoir” (Good evening) at night. A firm handshake is the norm when meeting someone for the first time. However, it is customary among friends to exchange a kiss on both cheeks, a practice known as “la bise.”
Let’s move on to dining etiquette. The French take their food seriously, and mealtimes are regarded as a time to unwind and socialize. Before beginning a meal, it is customary to say “Bon appétit.” Remember to keep your hands (but not your elbows) on the table and wait for the host to begin eating or toasting before you do. And, of course, take your time eating; rushing through a meal is considered impolite.
Another important aspect of French culture is language. While many Parisians speak English, they appreciate it when visitors attempt to communicate in French. A few simple phrases can go a long way toward demonstrating respect for the local culture. And if you have any questions, don’t be afraid to ask. The French are proud of their culture and enjoy sharing it with others.
Parisians are known for their fashion sense when it comes to dressing. They dress more formally than residents of many other cities. While there is no strict dress code, it is best to dress neatly and modestly when visiting churches or other religious sites.
Finally, in France, punctuality is viewed differently. While being a few minutes late is usually not a big deal, it’s polite to call and notify someone if you’re going to be late.
Here are some suggestions for how to respect the local culture. First, pay attention. Take note of how the locals act and follow their example. Second, be courteous. Recognize the importance of customs and traditions to the French and respect them, even if they differ from your own. Third, keep an open mind. Accept the differences and relish the opportunity to learn about a new culture.
Remember that traveling is more than just seeing new places; it is also about experiencing new cultures. You’re not just being a responsible traveler when you understand and respect French customs and etiquette; you’re immersing yourself in the French way of life. And who knows what else? You might fall in love with the Parisian way of life, just like I did.
As you prepare to explore the wonders of Paris, remember to bring not only your suitcase but also your sense of etiquette. Respect the local culture, embrace the Parisian way of life, and allow the city of lights to warmly welcome you. Best wishes!
To ensure a safe and enjoyable visit to Paris, as with any major city, a certain level of awareness and precaution is required. While the city is generally safe, it is always a good idea to be prepared and informed about potential hazards and how to deal with them.
Pickpocketing is a common problem for travelers, especially in crowded tourist areas and on public transportation. Always keep an eye on your belongings to avoid becoming a victim of such incidents. Use bags that close securely and stay in your line of sight. Displaying expensive items, such as jewelry or high-end electronics, may draw unwanted attention.
Another piece of advice is to exercise caution when exploring the city at night. While Paris is famous for its vibrant nightlife, some areas can be dangerous after dark. Avoid walking alone in unfamiliar areas and stick to well-lit, busy streets. Using a reputable taxi service or rideshare app for late-night transportation can be a safer option.
It is critical to know who to contact in the event of an emergency. In France, the general emergency number is 112, which can be dialed for any type of emergency. You can dial 15 for medical emergencies only. The number to dial if you need the police is 17. It’s a good idea to save these phone numbers before your trip.
Finally, keep a physical and digital copy of all important documents, such as your passport and travel insurance. In the event of loss or theft, having these copies on hand can speed up the replacement process.
Remember that safety does not happen by chance. It is the result of careful planning and sound decision-making. So, as you take in the sights and sounds of Paris, keep these safety precautions in mind. They’ll make sure your memories of the city are nothing but positive.
As we conclude this guide, take a moment to reflect on the journey we’ve taken together. We’ve waded through the intricate web of Parisian public transportation, discovered hidden gems tucked away in charming neighborhoods, savored the flavors of French cuisine, and immersed ourselves in the city’s rich culture and etiquette. We’ve learned how to make the most of our Parisian adventure by exploring the city from the ground up, from the iconic Eiffel Tower to the bustling local cafes.
Paris is a city that promises an unforgettable experience with its blend of history, culture, and modernity. It’s a city that begs you to explore, discover, taste, and fall in love with it. So, dear travelers, I urge you to take the leap of faith. Pack your belongings, put on your walking shoes, and allow Paris to sweep you off your feet.
Here are some additional resources to help you on your journey: The Paris Tourist Office’s official website (www.parisinfo.com) is a wealth of information, ranging from upcoming events to practical advice. The RATP website and app for public transportation provide real-time updates and route planning services. For foodies, the Michelin Guide is your go-to guide for the best dining experiences in town.
And, of course, this is only the beginning. Paris is a city that is always changing, and there is always something new to discover. So, dear readers, I invite you to share your own advice and experiences. Your contributions and stories are what make this guide truly comprehensive.
If you’ve got the travel bug and aren’t sure where to go next, how about Rome? With its ancient ruins, stunning architecture, and delectable cuisine, the Eternal City rivals Paris for a one-of-a-kind experience. It’s a city that, like Paris, combines the old and the new in a distinctively unique harmony.
https://medium.com/@lonestarglitztravel/when-in-rome-getting-lost-and-found-in-the-eternal-city-8f86e2807f7
So there you have it: a comprehensive guide to discovering Paris’s wonders. But keep in mind that the true magic of travel is found not in the destination but in the journey. It’s in the excitement of stepping off a plane in a new city, the delight of trying a new dish, the awe of standing in front of a historical monument, and the connections you make along the way. So go forth and explore, because the world is a book, and those who do not travel only read a page. Best wishes!

On a sunny Spring afternoon, UCL Postgrad Urbanists went on a book walk through Regent’s Park discussing Edward Chisholm’s A Waiter in Paris (2021).
We were joined by PhD researchers across UCL departments including Geography, The Bartlett School of Architecture, Institute of Education, and Engineering. In this piece, Postgrad Urbanists Sidra Ahmed (PhD, UCL Geography) and Yichang Sun (PhD, UCL The Bartlett School of Architecture) share reflections from the walk and a post-walk Q&A we had with the author Edward Chisholm.
The Book Walk
A Waiter in Paris is Chisholm’s memoir of his seven years in Paris. It opens with Chisholm as an English graduate in Paris with little to no prospects and hardly any money, but the guts to wait it out and figure out what Paris has in store for him. The book is an underdog narrative that follows an English waiter, (or rather, ‘waiter-in-waiting’ who starts out as a restaurant runner), experiencing Paris via the stage of the fictional ‘Le Bistrot de La Seine’ restaurant and its backstage gang of waiters, cooks, and management.
We’re taken on Chisholm’s story from passing as a waiter barely speaking French, navigating the kitchen politics of Le Bistrot de La Seine, to yes, becoming a waiter. Through Chisholm’s observations, we encounter a Paris that is dynamic, multifaceted, and deeply human. Below we share a few highlights from our discussion during the walk.
We opened the book walk by asking everyone to share moments in the book which were amusing. Our favourites include a moment when Chisholm, as a runner at that time, figures out how to manipulate the waiter politics to finally earn tips in the chapter ‘The Rise of the Runner’ and avenge the stealing of his tips from a previous shift:
“The role of the runner, it turns out, is a corrupt one. This is my source of prestige, I realize. If the waiters are bounty hunters, constantly chasing tips, then the runner is a mercenary, a gun for hire, His allegiances are to no one, only the person who pays him best. The waiters know that, if the runner is working with them, then he’s not working with anyone else.
At the end of the evening there’s no need to ask the waiters for the three euros. They all give more. It’s like protection money.
I’ve noticed a change in the others, too: they see me as an equal, as one of them — no longer a plaything. That’s what they were waiting for, perhaps, to see if I had enough grit to stick it out.”
— A Waiter in Paris (2021: pp.132–133)
Another encounter involves the procuring, preparing and delivery of olives for a special group of diners — only Chisholm, his fellow waiter, and the reader know the journey those olives took. We also mused on ‘live where the tomatoes are good’, a piece of layered life advice fellow waiter Salvatore gives Chisholm. Sidenote, we did end up discussing where the tomatoes are actually good — Croatia and Italy were two suggestions.
As we carried and referenced our copies of the book during the walk, we also interrogated the title itself. A Waiter in Paris activates a social role coupled with one’s urban imaginations of a city such as Paris; it makes you want to fill in the story. Other book titles and song names that made us feel the same came to mind, especially those from the perspective of the outsider. Sting’s single Englishman in New York. Mark Vanhoenacker’s Imagine a City: A Pilot Sees the World (2022). We were even reminded of a past Q&A we had with Geographer and Author Giada Peterle who described ‘urban spaces as narrative archives’. A Waiter in Paris is one such archive of life in Paris activated by Chisholm’s writing:
“It’s not really my story; I was merely an observer passing through. ‘A camera with its shutter open’, as Christopher Isherwood wrote of his time in Berlin.”
— A Waiter in Paris (2021: p.3)
As we follow Edward’s journey from runner to waiter, we find ourselves rooting for him as he navigates the complexities of the restaurant world. To read a book titled A Waiter in Paris is to also gain an insight into how waitering is an art form, requiring a delicate balance of humanity, decency, and sometimes manipulation.
We talked about how the scene of the Parisian restaurant became the author’s tiny window to observe urban life. As a “third place” in the city, as described by author Ray Oldenburg in The Great Good Place (1999), the restaurant is not merely a place to eat in. It works as an everyday melting pot of different cultures generating interpersonal and communal interaction of people from all walks of life. We commented on the ‘place ballet’ of La Bistrot de La Seine, it was an intersection of different groups of people’s spatial and temporal routines. For the workers, the restaurant was a daily grind and seasonal challenge; for tourists and diners, a one-off adventure immersed in the performance of the front stage of the restaurant. They are all experiencing a different Paris.
We reflected on the ballet of behaviours we saw in the lower and upper kitchens of La Bistrot de La Seine, scenes that are usually invisible to diners and revealed to the reader. As readers we feasted on the time pressures and anxieties that came with waiters fighting it out to get their orders completed, putting food that had fallen on the floor back on the plate, or cleaning a spill with anything that came to hand be it a sleeve, napkin or something out of the bin. As we walked and talked, we were reminded of The Bear TV series which also depicts the intensity and chaos of a Chicago restaurant kitchen with the constant shouting of “BEHIND”, anxieties of completing orders on time, and colourful characters.
Along with facing the restaurant and the city, we thought about how Chisholm faces himself with the city and Philosopher Georg Simmel’s Metropolis and Mental Life (1903) on how one mentally navigates the city. We’re taken on twists and turns through Parisian restaurants, different accommodation, dark streets and hidden spaces as well as through the twists and turns of Chisholm’s own mentality in navigating being homeless, jobless and an outsider.
The metropolis, or the magnificent city, has a unique way of fragmenting our mentality, leaving us staring nakedly into the abyss. Yet, at the same time, it has the power to heal. This duality is beautifully captured in the book. One such expression of this is in a moment from the chapter ‘A Taste of Restaurant Life’ where Chisholm writes about his own gaze on Paris:
“Even when you’re exhausted, broke and hungry, there’s still an indefinable magic of the place. And no matter how much your feet hurt after a never-ending shift, how physically dead you feel as you walk up the Avenue de l’Opéra at night, or across the Seine under the shadow of Notre-Dame, inside, you can’t help but feel intensively alive. Because you’re in it, you’re in the film. You’re not watching, you’ve got a walk-on, speaking part. And everything feels possible. Besides, when you’re in Paris you couldn’t care less about anywhere else. Your world shrinks; it’s the centre of the universe. There is nowhere else.”
— A Waiter in Paris (2021: p.204)
Edward, thank you for answering our questions. We had a wonderful walk through Regent’s Park discussing A Waiter in Paris. As urbanists, we couldn’t help but dwell on the spatial imaginings and way in which the grit of urban life was portrayed in this account of your time in Paris. So that is the perspective from which we would like to ask our questions.
You wrote about how within Paris it may be possible to find all of France and that the scenes and stories you observed are indicative of urban life in other cities too. George Orwell’s Down and Out in Paris and London (1933) was also one of the books you mention travelling with you when you moved to Paris.
How would you compare the ‘dark heart of Paris’ to the ‘dark heart’ of London? Or equally, to anywhere else you have lived?
It’s hard to compare, in the sense that both cities are a reflection of their histories. For example, one thing you notice immediately is how former colonies play a huge part in the ethnic make-up of the city. In France, the majority of people working at the lower end of the social ladder are North African or from sub-Saharan French-speaking African countries. In London South Asia is much more represented.
That said, London also feels more international, more cosmopolitan, you find the whole world there; whereas Paris feels distinctly French, particularly intramuros, outside of the peripherique it is a different story, there’s a distinct division there. Whereas in London, which is more a collection of joined up villages, everybody is more spread out.
We mused on the title during our walk too and asked our attendees what it was about the book title that made them want to join us. The title contains a fusion of spatial and personal identity. In the book, you mention publishing ‘Notes from a Parisian kitchen’ in The New York Times.
When did ‘Notes from a Parisian Kitchen’ become A Waiter in Paris? And why this title?
Notes from a Parisian Kitchen was the title given to the article by the NY Times editor, probably inspired by Dostoyevsky’s Notes from Underground. My working title for the manuscript was always The Waiting Game, because the double sense of waiting intrigued me. However this was never particularly liked, and in the end the publisher wanted something that didn’t need to be deciphered, and that’s where A Waiter in Paris was born. There was some discussion whether it should be waiters, plural, but in the end it stayed singular.
Paris itself is a main character. And we say character because of the way in which your writing personifies Paris as human and as female. You describe Paris as ‘quiet’ with ‘her avenues empty’ in the opening. During the snow, Paris is ‘replaced by a soft memory’. Paris ‘cares little’ for the workers that keep the city running ‘for she has seen them all before and will see many more’.
Can you reflect on this personification? What image and experience of Paris does it help depict?
It’s almost a cliché to refer to Paris in the feminine, and initially I tried to avoid it, but coming from London, and essentially comparing it with London, the personification became more apt. London feels distinctly masculine in my mind’s eye. Whereas Paris more feminine. Maybe it’s the intimacy of central Paris, the presence of more organic forms on building façades or metro entrances. It’s also no doubt informed by other writers. But there’s something more austere and concrete based about London, which obviously suffered a lot more damage during the war.
You’ve shown us a really delicate description of the urban spaces of Paris at various scales, touching upon both the outdoor city and the interior world of the Parisian restaurant. As readers, we’ve encountered urban life in Paris’ alleys, courtyards, trains, parks, a car and so much more. We’ve been presented with the socio-spatial hierarchies of restaurant kitchens and cafes as well as the experience of being together yet feeling alone at the Bistrot de la Seine.
Can you share an insight into your writing process for distilling and capturing this array of spatial dimensions?
That’s very kind, thank you. I have to admit that this was a huge part of the writing process. So much ink has been spilled describing Paris that I was keen not to fall into the same trap and employ the usual tired tropes to describe the city. Giving a sense of the size of the city, the macro experience helps place the reader in the intoxicating experience of being somewhere new, and all of the 19th century changes to Paris (wide boulevards, square, and public spaces) for this upon you. But it is very superficial, in the sense that you quickly step from this ceremonial world to something much smaller, more intimate, and often forgotten to the mists of time. The interior spaces are, especially in the less glamorous areas, often dilapidated after years and years of neglect. So choosing the right details to express this hopefully gave the reader a rich idea of what these places were actually like.
We opened the book walk by asking everyone if there was a moment in the book that made them laugh. And we would love to ask you the same. Is there a memory from the book that still makes you laugh when you recall it?
There were many moments that made me laugh, in fact the whole experience was probably much more joyous than written. The writing process tended to bring out the feeling of injustice I felt about the experience and the people that are going through it. So in the second draft I was keen to rectify that by adding more of the humourous exchanges that were the day-to-day of life in a gang of waiters.
We are part of UCL Urban Lab and we wanted to use the term ‘urban lab’ to launch our last question. You are currently working on a second book project about Paris. Can you tell us a bit about your next book and why Paris is your ‘urban lab’ for writing stories?
I imagine it’s because I amassed such a wealth of experience from the seven years I lived there that I have a rich well from which to draw upon. I love the idea of being able to transport someone there through words.
As for the next book, it is slightly different in that I will be recounting the story of something that happened in the late 60s. So I will need to draw on my own experience but also plenty of primary sources. To be honest, I am still working through how I will do it, but I am hoping that the research will illuminate the way.

Paris in the rain is glorious, especially if the rain isn’t hard and unrelenting. My wife Gaywynn and I were in Paris, staying in the 16th arrondissement at our friend Philippe’s grand apartment in May. Philippe’s place is on the rue Raynouard, not far from the Seine, within walking distance of Trocadéro. We stayed a week. We stayed long enough so that we fell into a kind of domestic routine. That included shopping for food. It’s a lovely way to experience Paris, and we were grateful.
Some days it rained. It never stopped us.
Philippe walked us around his neighborhood, showed us where he shopped for food, greeting all the shop owners who clearly knew him. Later, we followed in his footsteps. We cooked a few meals for Philippe, and so we needed to buy food.
We did our shopping mainly on the rue de l‘Annonciation, a narrow pedestrian street that flows into the broader, longer rue de Passy. We walked it many times, up and back, passing by all those shops and stores that truly sustain a neighborhood — butcher, produce, wine, bakery, seafood. Each is its own world, pulsing with tradition and high standards. Paris is a city of shops. (How many cities do you know still are?) They give you intimacy. They individualize you.
Sometimes, we would eat at Aéro, a brasserie at the end of rue de l‘Annonciation on the Place de Passy, where we could sit outside. We came to think of it as our brasserie. That’s what happens when you stay for a while in Paris. You find a place to call your own. You make an attachment to it. It belongs to you, and you belong to it.
After a week, we belonged to our neighborhood and to Paris.
We bought meat at Les Bouchers Doubles at 43 rue de l’Annonciation. We bought vegetables at Marché Couvert de Passy. We bought pastries at Aux Merveilleux de Fred — yes, I know, “Fred” doesn’t sound French — and bread at Aux Pains de Manon, both on rue de l’Annonciation. Did any of the people behind the counters recognize us by the end of the week? I’d like to think, or to pretend, they did. They always smiled, in any case.
Some days we went to Monoprix, a store I like very much. The name, Monoprox, is not very romantic. It’s a practical place, with a practical name, and I always feel practical shopping there. You don’t shop at Monoprix for souvenirs, but you do find things you need. For splendor, Gaywynn and I went to La Grande Épicerie de Paris on rue de Passy, where we found the best France has to offer. It was amazing to see what they considered exotic produce from America — they sold Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, for example.
It rained several days while we were there. I never minded. I think rain brings out a stunning aspect of Paris. It makes the city moody, and me as well. I feel I’m a poet when I walk rainy Paris. Rain is disparaged too much, more than it should be. People talk about rain as if it were some kind of setback. It’s rain. That’s all. You can get wet. It’s all worth it when the rain is falling in Paris, and the gray light makes everything the best black and white film you’ve ever seen, and you smell the damp air and hear car tires hissing on the wet streets.
I think you can be a citizen of Paris by right of passion.
When it rained, we might dart into the Librairie Fontaine, a sweet bookstore on rue de l‘Annonciation. We discovered one of the young employees, who spoke flawless French, was American. I’d never heard any American speak French as well as he did. What I wouldn’t give to be able to work in a French bookstore! Well, here’s to reincarnation.
I speak French passably. If a Parisian speaks, as they do sometimes, at the speed of light, then I’m lost. If the conversation is at a reasonable clip, though, and it’s just the two of us, I can manage. Speaking a language not your own and that you don’t speak fluently is a lesson in humility and error. But when you speak French in Paris and are understood, that’s a chest-rising feeling. So, I jump in. I never mind being clumsy. They’re not going to report me.
Returning after a long day on the Left Bank, we walked from our Métro station, Passy, up the long hill to rue de Passy. We didn’t have the climbing energy the students who disembarked with us had. Never mind. There was Desgranges bakery waiting at the top, on rue de Passy, with something weight-increasing, but God did it taste good. That gave us the motivation we needed.
Then home to rue Raynouard, into the small, slowly-rising elevator, off at our floor, inserting the key Philippe had given us, opening the door, throwing ourselves onto his couch, restoring ourselves, and then ready, in a while, to venture out again.
Our corner of Paris. It’s in our heart.

Ah, le dixième. One of my favorite Parisian neighborhoods (after my beloved Montmartre, of course), you’ll often find me there on a given weekend. It’s one of the least “touristy” areas in the city — I lived in Paris for a full six months as a student back in 2012 and never even knew it existed — and I love spending time in these small pockets of unspoiled places in Paris. Well, maybe not completely unspoiled but you get the idea.
And while I’d love to keep the 10th arrondissement all to myself, I’m no gatekeeper. For those of you coming to Paris to visit, or maybe Paris residents who, like me in 2012, never ventured up to the tenth, here are some spots to add to your to-see lists.
The Gare du Nord and Gare de l’Est aren’t necessarily “sights to see,” but they are in the 10th arrondissement and you’ll likely need to access them at some point if you plan on doing some traveling.
Both are known as being on the “sketchy” side but I have never personally had any issues there. Pay attention and keep your belongings close and you shouldn’t have a problem. Gare du Nord will get you to places in northern Europe (as well as merry old England) and Gare de L’Est will get you to places in eastern Europe (and beyond), respectfully.
If you have spent time in the 10th arrondissement, I’m willing to bet it was along the Canal Saint Martin. This little waterway that flows from Bastille all the way up to La Villette in the 19th arrondissement has often been a sanctuary for me, particularly on those sweltering August nights, as the leaves begin to fall in autumn, and even during a drizzle in the colder months.
When the weather cooperates, there are plenty of places to sit down next to the canal with a good book. If you don’t feel the need to be directly on the canal, there’s a lovely park called the Jardin Villemin with lots of grass to sit on.
My yoga studio is along the canal (Jivamukti Yoga Paris if you’re interested), and I will often make the 40-minute walk from my place in the 18th arrondissement to get there.
The bar Le Comptoir Général is a vibe and is my go-to when I want to impress friends in town visiting. Chez Prune is a bit more on the casual side (and more authentically French, in my opinion), and I’ve shared many a glass of wine/charcuterie board there over the years. Ten Belles for coffee, always, and Maria Belza for tapas. Trust me.
For those who love a good story, the Canal was also where Earful Tower host Oliver Gee heard the story that led to his first children’s book, Kylie the Crocodile in Paris. It makes a fun gift for kids who might be interested in the City of Light.
There are a myriad of marchés (markets) to be found in Paris — some are static, like the rue Mouffetard or le marché des Enfants-Rouges, while others set up shop just a few times a week.
Like le marché des Enfants-Rouges, le marché Saint-Quentin is a covered market. It’s one of the largest and oldest markets of its kind in the city (first built in 1835, destroyed in 1852, and rebuilt in 1866), and is home to produce sellers, butchers, florists, fishmongers, cheesemongers…there are even places to buy beer and wine.
While this isn’t my favorite marché in the city (I have a penchant for rue Mouffetard myself), it’s worth a visit if you get there early enough to beat the crowds. Doors open at 8am every day.
The 10th arrondissement is not short on nightlife. I like places that are cool and cozy with a big enough terrasse to fit me and all of my friends. I first started hanging out on the cour des Petites Écuries because a friend of mine worked at a small bar there. That was about five years ago and I often find myself returning on a Thursday or Friday evening.
The street is tiny, only about 850 feet long. Nestled along the cobblestones are about a dozen cafés, bars, and restaurants to discover. And, if you venture off the street you’ll find dozens more. It’s a good option if you like to bar-hop and wander. Most places are very affordable if you’re on a budget.
Like most Parisian neighborhoods, the 10th arrondissement is also a wonderful place for a stroll. Use the places I mentioned above as a jumping-off point and then explore on your own. You just may get lost for a few hours, but that’s never a bad thing in Paris.

Last Thursday, April 3, my family and I got dressed in historically-inspired formal wear and headed off to The Buckland Club’s Siege of Paris dinner.
The dinner was over a year in the making, and I’m still so proud, honored, and amazed to say that I’ve been involved from nearly the start of it.
In March 2024, I was contacted by Andrew Morris, Chairman of The Buckland Club, a club that meets twice every year in Birmingham, England, for unusual themed dinners. Named for Frank Buckland, a 19th century British naturalist who famously ate countless different kinds of animals, their motto is Semper in ventrem aliquid novi. (Always something new in the stomach.).
Andrew explained that the theme of the Club’s spring 2025 dinner would be the Siege of Paris, and he wanted to know if I’d like to be its sponsor.
The role wasn’t a financial one (much to my relief — my love of the Siege of Paris is boundless, but alas, my budget is not), but rather more like an organizer and lecturer. I would help plan the menu (including, I’d find out, the images on the actual paper menus and place mats), and then, on the night of the dinner, I’d discuss each course and the history behind it in 5–7 minutes in front of a hungry and curious crowd.
I was very honored — and all in. I loved the idea of bringing food from the Siege to life…even though it was notoriously terrible.
That, though, Andrew explained to me, was exactly why The Buckland Club’s members wanted to try it out.
Over the past year, Andrew, as well as Club president Roger Hale and deputy chair Hazel Riggall, have been frequent online companions. We’ve spent hours discussing things like how to acquire edible and ethically sourced zoo animals to eat, the history of Parisian bread, and the availability of potatoes and cheese during the Siege.
As you might imagine, I was thrilled to be able to talk about and dissect (no pun intended) these topics. And it was always such a pleasure to receive their friendly and curious messages, and to see them “live” on Zoom calls.
We had some challenges along the way, just as you would with any major undertaking. For instance, Roger, who does the page layout for the Club’s menus, needed a more high-definition copy of the Café Voisin menu from the Siege. Luckily, we were able to reach out to the Musée Escoffier, who has an original copy and very kindly sent us an actual photo of it.
There were also long email exchanges about the bread. If you read this blog, you probably know I’m a tiny bit obsessed with Siege bread, to say the least. When white flour ran out during the Siege, bread was made with ingredients like potato flakes, crushed peas, and even straw. Intrepid bread makers Roger and Hazel were able to come up with several variations of Siege bread, based on contemporary accounts we have of it. But most of it had to be edible…more edible, that is, than actual Siege bread, which notoriously caused indigestion and was so horrible that pieces of it were saved as souvenirs of the hardship Parisians endured during the Siege.
That kind of adaptation sums up what the dinner became. On the one hand, the members of The Buckland Club are boundlessly curious and open-minded when it comes to food. But on the other hand, we didn’t want anyone to leave the dinner hungry or sick. So, some compromises were made.
In the end, the dinner ended up being a wonderful, Siege-inspired affair. And while each course may not have been an exact replica of what someone would have eaten during this time, it was an intriguing jumping-off point for me to discuss during my speeches and a very cool homage to that era.
The Buckland Club members were attentive and enthusiastic listeners, which truly warmed my heart and made the evening even more fun. And they’re just great people in general. It was an unforgettable experience.
If you’re curious about what exactly we ate, here’s a breakdown of the menu (with photos of each course).
The paper menus and place mats
Okay, these weren’t edible parts of the Siege of Paris dinner, but they were definitely important. Roger Hale had asked me to send him images I thought would illustrate the Siege and our particular dinner. We had limited space, so it was a challenge, but in the end, I sent him:
~ one of my favorite cartoons from that time, an illustration by Cham of a man at a dinner table who’s just had a cat jump down his throat. The French caption translates to: “The risk of eating mice is that your cat might chase after them.”
~ a drawing of a line in front of a Municipal Butcher’s. Parisians would redeem their increasingly meager meat (or, as the Siege continued, dried fish) rations here. Sometimes, supplies would run out and the people would complain and even try to storm the butcher’s, hence the presence of members of the National Guard. Getting your ration often meant queuing for hours during a winter with record-breaking cold temperatures.
~ a drawing of one of the city’s infamous cat, dog, and rat butcher stands. These animals, along with horses, were the main sources of meat for Parisians, outside their small ration from the municipal butchers (if the ration was still available and they were able to brave hours-long lines and freezing temperatures).
~ another cartoon by Cham, of a well-dressed man holding a loaf of bread beneath his arm as he walks along the street. This was from a moment fairly early in the Siege where non-government bakeries or possibly one’s own kitchen could still provide white-flour loaves. People were being asked to bring their own bread to restaurants, and having your fine white flour bread was a status symbol.
~ a photo of one of my Siege of Paris bread souvenirs.
~ a famous image and relic from the Siege: The December 25, 1870 menu from the Café Voisin, which, like many Parisian restaurants, still operated during the Siege, though their offerings had to be adapted based on what food was available. Sometimes, restaurants showed a sense of honesty and humor, as in this case. Among other Siege-era offerings, you’ll find “Le Chat flanqué de rats” (cat flanked by rats), as well as meat from zoo animals. This menu was also one of the main sources of inspiration for our Siege of Paris dinner.
~ one of the cover images from Album du siège par Cham et Daumier, a collection of cartoons by Cham and Daumier that cover the experience of the Siege. This particular image shows an allegorical representation of Paris (recognizeable by both her tower crown and the convenient word “Paris” written on it) eagerly gathering rats into her mouth while surrounded by a pot with a dog and a cat in it.
Roger also added photos of the Siege bread-inspired loaves he and Hazel had made for the dinner, on a special insert page that featured my translations of some of the contemporary accounts and recipes we have for Siege bread.
I can’t tell you how moved I was when I came into the dining room at the Edgbaston Golf Club and saw those place settings with these familiar and beloved illustrations. It felt like a real way to honor the people who experienced the Siege of Paris, and to celebrate their humor and resilience. Everything also just looked really great.
I felt blown away, as you can see from the expression on my face in this photo, which my son snapped just as we sat down.
Canapés
But I’m getting a bit ahead of myself, because we didn’t enter the dining room right away. First, there were drinks and canapés.
The drinks ranged from water to alcohol, which were all available during the Siege. There wasn’t Coke at the time, but my son was still happy to be offered a glass, and hey, other kinds of sugary treats were also usually easily obtainable during the Siege, including chocolate and jam.
The canapés themselves consisted of scoops of sardine pâté with a slice of radish on top. Sardines are included in the Café Voisin’s menu, but were likely canned or dried. We had discussed using some kind of dried fish, which was what was mostly available during the Siege. In fact, towards the end of it, many municipal butcher’s had run out of meat and were giving out dried cod instead. But that would have been a bit tricky to eat.
The radish slice was inspired by the Café Voisin menu, where radishes are listed among the hors d’oeuvres. Vegetables were hard to come by during the Siege, since no one had been prepared to stockpile those that might last, and since the bitterly cold autumn and winter wasn’t the best time to grow anything. And yet, some Parisians or refugees from nearby suburbs did have small gardens or small stockpiles of vegetables from before the Siege. Some of them cultivated gardens just outside the city wall, or might even have ventured back to their evacuated suburban homes to see what they could gather (if the place hadn’t been looted already). Others, including restaurant owners, may have procured vegetables from the black market.
So, while not every Parisian was regularly enjoying vegetables, it was possible, especially for the clientele of an upscale restaurant like the Café Voisin, who had different ways of obtaining them, from possibly growing them or relying on their own stock, to paying exorbitant prices for them legally or through black market sellers.
The canapés were served on modern-day Siege bread. This was made by Roger and Hazel, based on recipes and accounts from the Siege, including:
“One pound of this bread contains: An eighth of common wheat flour, 4/8 of a mixture of potato flakes, rice, lentils, split peas, vetches, oats, and rye ground up in abnormal portions, 2/8 of water, 1/8 of straw and vegetable shell remains.” — Jacques-Henri Paradis, in his memoir Journal du siège, par un bourgeois de Paris (my translation)
and
“It seems to have been made with old panama hats picked up out of the gutters.” — courtesy of the often sassy chronicler Henri d’Alméras (my translation)
Hazel’s bread contained Siege-inspired ingredients including rye flour, chickpea flour, and pea flour. Roger created two versions of Siege bread. The first contains ingredients like dried and pounded potato peelings, green and red lentils, buckwheat flour, and rice flour.
The second version of Roger’s bread contained actual straw.
As you can imagine, as someone sort of obsessed with Siege bread, I couldn’t wait to try these. While the sardine pâté stole the show in terms of flavor, I was thrilled to detect little rough, grainy bits in the bread.
Unfortunately, none of these bits were straw. The Club had decided not to serve Roger’s Siege bread batch that contained straw, although some members had tried it during a tasting a few weeks prior. The general consensus of those I talked to was that it lived up to its reputation and was hard to eat. One Club member told me she was still picking bits of straw out of her teeth!
That said, another member pulled me aside towards the end of the evening and confessed that he didn’t think the straw bread was that bad and that if he were ever in a Siege of Paris situation, he’d be fine with the bread.
While I was glad Roger had made it and that some people had actually tasted it and could tell me about it, I have to admit, I was disappointed that I wouldn’t get to experience the straw Siege bread myself. Not even to taste, per se — one of the things we’d all discussed was possibly leaving a small slice of it by each place setting with the option of either tasting it or saving it as a souvenir. But it turns out there wasn’t enough of the straw bread for all 60+ attendees.
Luckily, there would be a surprise for me a little later…..
First Course: Onion Soup without the Onion, and another version of Siege bread
A basket of bread inspired by Siege recipes was on every table for the first course. This bread had been baked by the kitchen staff of the Edgbaston Golf Club, led by Head Chef Chris Haynes. Everyone I met who worked at the Edgbaston Golf Club was kind and amazing. I’m so grateful for their help and to Chris and his team for being so open to making all of these unusual dishes. I can’t thank them enough.
Their version of the bread was more edible and went down smoothly. I think it could have absolutely been served at a regular dinner without raising an eyebrow, and for that, I’m sure our guests were grateful.
As for the soup, the name was inspired by an actual recipe in La Cuisinière assiégée, ou L’art de vivre en temps de siége (The Besieged Cook, or art de vivre in times of siege), a cookbook anonymously published near the end of the Siege or shortly after. The book contains recipes for homemakers and, understandably, focuses a lot on replacing or simply doing without certain ingredients.
Onion soup without the onion has always made me smile a bit. The description is at once practical and honest, and a bit funny — very much in keeping with the sense of grim humor we see in things like the cartoons published during the Siege or on restaurant menus that openly describe the unusual animals they’re serving, rather than being discreet about it (say, by calling cat “rabbit” or simply listing stew, not its ingredients).
The recipe itself, though, isn’t just a joke. It’s an actual option for someone with few ingredients available to them (the book also contains an actual onion soup recipe, if the cook was able to get their hands on an onion or two).
Here’s the recipe for Onion Soup without the Onion, from La Cuisinière assiégée (my translation):
“Melt fat into a frying pain; take slices of bread, that you will toast for a long time; add the necessary amount of water, salt, and pour it over your slices of bread.”
Andrew and I toyed with the idea of actually serving this soup. But seeing that it was a paid dinner and that we didn’t want Club members to actually starve, Andrew came up with a different solution: Why not make a traditional French onion soup and then explain all of the ingredients, including cheese, normal bread, and actual onions, that would not have been in this recipe or have been easily available to most Parisians?
So, that’s what we did.
Although the part of me that longs for authenticity was a bit disappointed, the soup lifted my spirits. I’m actually not a big fan of French onion soup, but this one was seasoned in a way that just really clicked with me. I thoroughly enjoyed it and am glad to have tasted it, regardless of the context.
It was also a fun and unique approach to give my speech about this course and have everyone imagine each of its crucial ingredients missing. I think everyone felt grateful to not be eating onion soup during the Siege.
Main Course: Civet de Kangourou (Kangaroo Stew), Petits-Pois au Beurre (peas in butter), Boiled Potatoes
Our main course was one of the biggest decisions we had to make. Namely, what meat should we choose? Naturally, when you think of the Siege of Paris, meat sources like cat, dog, and, especially, rat, come to mind. But none of us wanted to eat cat or dog (or legally could have in the UK, for that matter).
It turns out that Andrew has tried dog before, during a trip to North Korea, and he could confirm that, as many Siege -era accounts claim, it tastes a bit like mutton. I’ve also heard testimonials by an Italian man who, during World War II, ate cat and said that, as Siege-era Parisians often claimed, it tastes like rabbit.
I haven’t heard much about what rat tasted like, but when you think about it, some cultures do eat other kinds of rodents — for instance, guinea pig in several South American countries, so it must be pretty tasty.
There was some discussion among club members about possibly procuring rat in some way, or replacing it with a similar rodent. But to be honest, that sort of sat heavily with me. I genuinely like rats, as you may know, and felt a bit sad about the prospect of eating one. Luckily, the idea was quickly shot down, since the Club had recently had a dinner where rodents were served and didn’t want to repeat themselves. The same went for horses, another fairly common meat source during the Siege.
When Andrew then suggested pigeon, which people do indeed eat today and would probably be fairly easy to get our hands on, I realized I had truly become immersed in the Siege of Paris, because I felt horrified.
Not just because I also really love pigeons and believe that if I were reincarnated as a bird, that’s what I would be, but because pigeons were considered heroes during the Siege of Paris.
In a city cut off from the world, they were the only way for people to get messages from outside the city walls, through a roll of microfilm inserted into a metal tube attached to a pigeon’s feathers. Although not every homing pigeon made it back to Paris safely, those who did were able to get more than 100, 000 messages to isolated, worried Parisians. That’s why when you look at many images commemorating the Siege, you’ll often see drawings of pigeons included. They were even included on Bartholdi’s monument to the Siege’s balloonists that stood at Porte des Ternes, before it was melted down in World War II.
Not every pigeon in Paris in 1870 and 1871 was a homing pigeon, of course, but they were all respected, because you never knew.
I’m sure some people still ate pigeons — in fact, a Siege memoir by Charles Laurent claims that some people counted their tail feathers to determine whether or not they were homing pigeons in order to try to catch and eat those who weren’t. But even so, this wasn’t something that was accepted or proclaimed or joked about the same way eating just about any other animal was at the time.
So, pigeon was also ruled out for our menu (much to my secret relief).
In the end, we opted to go upscale and choose kangaroo, an animal that is still eaten today and is available in the UK. This wasn’t much of a compromise, though, since civet de kangourou (kangaroo stew) is an actual item on the Café Voisin menu.
Zoo animals from the Jardin des Plantes and the Jardin d’Acclimation, which was located just outside the city and whose animal population had to be relocated to the Jardin des Plantes, unfortunately weren’t able to be fed for very long after the Siege started. In order to keep them from suffering and dying a slow death from starvation, the zookeepers made an arrangement to sell most of the animals, either exclusively or primarily to the upscale Boucherie Anglaise (English Butcher’s, appropriately enough for the location of our dinner).
These animals could be sold freshly butchered or canned, and they came at a high price, which means most Parisians never got to taste them. But some more privileged ones did, including Victor Hugo, who wrote about eating elephant in his memoirs of the Siege.
Although the menus that offered zoo animals were often honest or humorous about it, many Parisians had a bit of melancholy, especially about eating elephant, since two of those elephants were Castor and Pollux, beloved animals who children used to ride at the zoo. The accounts of their deaths are among the most heartbreaking things I’ve ever read about the Siege.
In addition to elephant consommé and kangaroo stew, you’ll find other zoo animal offerings on the Café Voisin menu, including wolf, which Andrew very cleverly also “included” in our Siege of Paris dinner menu by serving his favorite wines, fittingly called Le Loup Blanc (The White Wolf) and L’Espirt du Loup (The Spirit of the Wolf).
As for our kangaroo stew, I was intrigued to try it (and trying hard not to think about how cool kangaroos are — after all, I eat pigs and cows all the time, and those animals are pretty cool in their own right, too). So was my son. One thing I admire about him is that while he can be a picky eater (for instance, despite being half-French, he did not want the melted Gruyere cheese in his French onion soup), he’s also an intrepid one. He’ll try almost anything, even if he’s not guaranteed to like it.
He had been talking about tasting kangaroo for weeks (maybe it’s a good thing that, unlike me when I was a kid, he’s not too into nature documentaries that feature them), and when the time came, he wasn’t disappointed. He described it as tasting like duck, and said “Mom, you’re going to love this!” as he enthusiastically took another bite.
Andrew was impressed by his comparison, which made me feel better about my son being there. There had been some debate about Edgbaston Golf Club’s policy, since they don’t usually allow children. But since the dinner was a private event, the Buckland Club advocated for us and my son was able to come and taste kangaroo and take lots of pictures of me and wear a suit and thin bowtie inspired by Napoleon III’s son Louis-Napoleon, who my son kind of looks like in one particular photo.
And so, Andrew announced at the dinner, my son is as of now the youngest person to attend a Buckland Club dinner, in all the Club’s 73-year history! I’m so grateful to Andrew for advocating for him, and to my son for behaving as well as I knew he would, and I’m glad he liked the food, too.
(My husband was also there, thrilled to wear a replica Civil War Union military jacket he’d gotten years ago as a gift from his American in-laws. I said if anyone asked him, he should tell them it was in homage to Wickham Hoffman, a former Civil War colonel who came to Paris and was American Ambassador Elihu Washburn’s secretary during the Siege. Both men’s diaries and/or memoirs happen to have been valuable sources to me when I was writing Hearts at Dawn, so everything tied nicely together.)
Sorry for hopping to another topic — back to the kangaroo. Although my son said it tasted like duck, we realized that was because he’s never tasted venison. But those of us who had, thought that it was a bit closer to that. It had a soft, pleasant, but slightly stringy texture that reminded me of brisket. Overall, a very good meal and one of the highlights.
The kangaroo stew served at the dinner was a sort of deconstructed version of the dish, which had probably been cooked along with the vegetables in the original version, both due to French tradition and probably the fact that this would have hidden the condition of some of the vegetables, which might not have been great-looking or could have been a bit wilted (for any leafy veggies or herbs that might have been included) at this point in the Siege.
Both peas and potatoes were somewhat available during the Siege. Petits pois au beurre — peas in butter — is even on the Café Voisin menu, although I’ve always been curious about the butter. From Berte Ainé , chef at another upscale restaurant, Peter’s, book Les menus d’un restaurant de Paris durant le siège, I know that dairy products could sometimes be procured via the black market (Ainé writes about a man who keeps milk-producing goats hidden in a barn or warehouse, for instance), but I do wonder if there were other places it was produced and sold, maybe legally? I want to do more research into this.
As for potatoes, you’ll sometimes come across them in menus or recipes from the time, but they were also fairly rare, at least rare enough for a sack of them to have been one of the items auctioned off at the Fête de la Charité, a charity event held in late December, around the time the Café Voisin menu was being served.
I haven’t come across many accounts about carrots in particular during the Siege, but they are listed, for instance, in the items and prices section of La Cuisinière assiégée. And they did taste really nice with the kangaroo….
Dessert: Cream of Rice, Coffee Served With Oat Milk
Although I don’t tend to like things like cream of rice, I was very excited to try this version, since it came from a Siege recipe I’d actually tried to make — and very, very badly failed at.
In December 2022, I tried my hand and making the cream of rice recipe included in La Cuisinière Assiégée. The recipe was challenging because there are no exact measurements or amounts of ingredients given, and instructions are cursory. My rice pudding ended up looking (and tasting) like just a pile of white rice with chocolate powder over it.
My blog post about my failed attempt at making crème de riz (cream of rice) was actually how Andrew found me in the first place, so while I didn’t get an edible dessert out of it, I got something so much better.
As I blogged at the time, I have no idea what the actual result of the recipe would have looked like at the time. Maybe this would have been close? Probably not, though, especially according to my French husband, who’s since re-read my blog post and the recipe and thinks there are a few things I should have done differently. We’re actually planning to try the recipe his way soon. I’ll report back on that when it happens.
As for the cream of rice served at the Siege of Paris dinner, it looked worlds away from what I’d made (which is a good thing). It was rich and creamy and comforting, which I’m not sure the original was — but again, I have no way of knowing for sure.
The one thing everyone noted about this one, though, was that you could still feel the rice grains. I don’t know if that has to do with the swap of oat milk (dairy milk was almost non-existent during the Siege, and the recipe calls for essentially making your own oat milk) or some other issue. Whatever the case, most Club members emptied their bowls. My son, who’s usually picky about texture, also really enjoyed it. So at the very least, at least dessert was good.
There was also coffee, which was available during the Siege, but in keeping with the Siege’s hardships, it was served with oat milk. (Sugar was also available for those who wanted it, since it wasn’t scarce during the Siege.)
The evening finished off with my final speech, as well as closing statements from Andrew, and absinthe for those who wanted it. Although absinthe is more associated with the Belle Epoque, it’s been around since at least the early 1800’s and was available during the Siege. My husband and I didn’t partake (nor did my son, I promise), but it was an interesting way to end the evening’s menu.
One of the best gifts ever
But the most amazing food-related conclusion of the evening came to me in the form of a gift. Towards the end of the meal, Andrew handed me a gift from him, Hazel, and Roger (in addition to a gift from the latter two, who had also incredibly kindly surprised me with a letter from January 1870), as well as the rest of the Club.
I opened it to find what is honestly one of the most thoughtful presents I’ve ever received, from anyone.
They had taken a small slice of Roger’s bread that had been made with the straw and mounted it onto a typed card — essentially making a modern-day Siege Bread souvenir.
Like most Siege bread souvenirs, the mounted card reads “Souvenir Historique”, but below the piece of bread, the text becomes wonderfully personal, reading:
THE BUCKLAND CLUB
SIEGE OF PARIS DINNER 1870–1871
SPONSOR: ALYSA SALZBERG
On the lower right-hand side is a picture of Frank Buckland. On the right is the Club’s seal and motto, Semper in ventrem aliquid novi. Between both is written:
Edgabaston Golf Club, Birmingham
Thursday 3rd April 2025
Examples of Siege Bread by Roger Hale
Here’s a comparison of a typical 1871 Siege of Paris souvenir shadow box and The Buckland Club’s modern-day Siege bread souvenir:
This gesture absolutely blew me away, and always will. I truly can’t express how moved I am by the thoughtfulness behind it.
My husband, son, and I are recovering from the amazing dinner and also a whirlwind 2-day stay in Birmingham where we used just about every free moment to visit and explore the city (huge shout-out to the surprisingly cool, fun, and fascinating Pen Museum, probably our favorite destination), try its famous Indian food, and take advantage of our sort-of guilty pleasure treat whenever we go to the UK, the Tesco meal deal. But as soon as we’re up and running again, my modern-day bread souvenir will join the 1871 souvenir shadow box on my wall.
I know that every time I look at it, I’ll feel a massive sense of joy, gratitude, and appreciation for everyone involved in this Siege of Paris dinner.
It was an amazing, once-in-lifetime experience to have collaborated on this dinner and have had the opportunity to try these Siege-inspired recipes. But best of all was being in the company of such interesting and truly kind people. I’m relieved that the Siege of Paris dinner went so well, but sad that it’s over. Still, I’ve made some memories — and friends — I’ll never forget.
A HUGE thank you again to Andrew, Hazel, and Roger, and to everyone at the Edgbaston Golf Club and The Buckland Club for this experience. And also for putting up with my Siege bread obsession.

It’s been more than a year since I landed at Charles de Gaulle airport, a huge brutalist concrete jungle that hardly brings you an idea you’re in the city called “the city of love”.
Paris’ reputation is an absolutely extraordinary case — is there any other city in the world that has such a well-known symbol as the Eiffel Tower or such a strong myth around it filled with croissants, love, and romance? You may name New York or London but to me, Paris is what everyone has heard of first. Still, thousands of people are trying to copy the mythical Parisian fashion style and oh là là, la vie est belle spirit.
Having a degree in architecture and a strong visual perception I decided to share my vision on what are the key elements of this iconic city, the one I’ve been having a chance to learn all this time being already-not-a-tourist, not a longtime local either which means I might still have a rather fresh perception.
A significant part of Parisian architecture was created by Haussmann’s renovation program back in the second half of the 19th century. The old medieval neighborhoods were mostly demolished and instead of them, Paris got some wide boulevards and avenues, parks, and squares with larger buildings.
Walking the streets of the city once you stop paying attention to shop signs, ads, and posters you notice that the color which covers the largest area is beige. It’s the most common color on the walls, especially when these buildings were built during the Haussmann renovation.
As someone who used to travel a lot, I can’t mention that this typical Parisian style of architecture played a crucial role in other geographical areas as well. The streets of Casablanca were renovated surely because of the colonial past back in time and as the result, they look really similar to Paris with the only difference — blanca, “white” — colored in white mainly. Or the notable buildings in Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, and Mexico City — everywhere I noticed similarities with Paris at some point.
Next comes the accent color and the first one I’d name is an emerald green. It’s the color you see on the fences of the parks, benches, advertising poles, vendors’ boxes next to the Seine and so many more details.
It’s an elegant touch showing the nobility, I suppose.
One more accent color is red. You see it mainly in cafes which often have that typical Parisian vibe — filled with rounded tables and rattan wicker chairs.
Go up to Galerie Lafayette or Pompidou museum terraces and you’ll see how the color palette changes. The dominant color is grey now, the color of the roofs.
Golden and lime green are some of the colors you’ll meet in sculptures and architectural details walking the streets of the city. They can have a secondary role in the overall look.
There’s more to mention but I’d limit the Paris color palette to these ones.
Main colors:
Accent colors:
Secondary colors:
The weather adds to the perception drastically. Personally, I really enjoy the rainy weather in this habitat (and that’s more than surprising) but once the sun comes up from the clouds the city shines brightly and c’est étonnant. That’s two very different modes and when it comes to colors here’s the comparison:
When it's sunny the buildings have a high contrast to the clear blue sky. While it’s rainy, the overall color palette loses its’ contrast and became more of the same color tone mode.
Is it all to mention regarding the visual perception of the city? Nope, there’s one more thing.
Being very artistic, Paris can be compared to a scene. Each scene has lightning settings and in Paris, they are set to warm light.
This truly brings some sort of magic into the evening views. Together with the Seine or the channel, old architecture, and the sunset sky, the picture looks full and aesthetic.
If on top of that, it rains, you’ll get even more lights thanks to reflection.
Walking the streets of the city we see text all around. In Paris, it has different styles — elegant like the signs of expensive shops, modern for hip areas, or old fashioned for the places with a rich history. Text is also part of the posters both announcing some events and bringing a message from protest rallies (a very common Parisian thing).
While the font styles are as various as the multicultural side of Paris, there exist certain patterns that keep the consistency.
“The metropolitan railroad, in the eyes of most Parisians, will only be excused if it rejects absolutely all industrial character so as to be completely a work of art. Paris must not be made into a factory, it must stay a museum.” — Charles Garnier, architect of the Opera.
And just like that, Paris got art nouveau-styled entries and names of the metro stations both created by Hector Guimard back in the first half of the 20th century.
It adds charms indeed even though right now it’s already more of a rarity. A much more common visual style of the metro was made in more recent times.
In order to unify the sign system of the whole transportation in Paris, the custom Parisine font was created in 1996. The task behind this font was to improve signage legibility and space economy. The custom typeface in Bold was first created based on the proportions of Helvetica Bold, condensed at 90%.
I’m not sure whether the Parisian metro can be named one of the biggest metro systems in the world still, it’s a huge organism and a system that has been evolving through decades. Thus, you can also meet Métro Alphabet font on some stations as all-written-in-caps signs. Also, things like metro maps and navigation on the train stations were made further. Maybe because of different organizations (Paris Transilien is part of SNCF), following the signs in the metro or train stations, you can notice other fonts too like the Achemine typeface introduced in 2008.
Paris is a city I visited quite a few times in the past and being a tourist I certainly tried to stick to my list of places and experiences to do. I saw it as a place full of contrasts but the beautiful side still prevailed.
Once I started to live here I began to discover the deeper layers of the city which I already fait connaissance with. Its’ multicultural side, its’ rich art scene, its’ gourmandise (attention to food), its’ culture, and people.
It’s a place where I felt a huge range of emotions. Where I am still étrangère and where I felt like I fully match its’ lifestyle exploring multiple expositions in the museums or going to a cinema to watch movies from the Cannes festival program.
Certainly, this journey keeps going on and my relations with Paris are evolving. We keep getting to know each other better. No matter how much garbage is on the streets both figuratively and literally (the visual garbage of the shops’ signs and ads vs. garbage caused by strikes) I still see the beauty behind it and it fascinates me.
Part of my love and respect for this city I shared in this article.

Stories of Vince Duqué’s grand experiment to be his authentic self in Paris after a lifetime of drinking the kool-aid of the American Dream

--
Listen

You can find my first article in this series, when I was three months out from my move to Paris, here.
“Are you excited about Paris yet?”
It’s an innocent enough question.
I’m pacing around my room while on the phone with my friend Anne: “Nope. Not excited one bit. Paris isn’t real until the visa is real,” I deadpan. It is October 7, and I think I’m unofficially five weeks out from my Paris move. I’m still not fully confident I’m actually going to Paris, actually. I haven’t heard news about my visa since I submitted the application back two weeks ago.
I hope Anne didn’t take my answer as a snarky one. 52 year-old me was trying to be like water and quell the anxiety generated last week by my inner child — the eight-year-old version of me — who had been having a series of micro-meltdowns, worried that my visa application was anything but “foolproof,” even though I bleeping spent €1,900 to make it so. I was still a bit raw from my mom’s passing and the end of my relationship with Sarah, as well as all the purging and the anticipation of all the major changes.
“It’s going to happen,” she assures me. I say nothing. I know she means well. “Why do you think you’ll have an issue?” she asks. I tell her what happened at my visa application appointment.
We FLASHBACK to September 27, the visa appointment at the VFS office:
The young clerk at the VFS office (the third-party company designated to pre-process the applications on their way to the French Consulate in Washington D.C) reviews my application and notes that it is incomplete but that she’d send the application anyway, as-is. “Wait, why are you writing that?” I plead.
“It says here on the checklist that since you are starting a business you need these documents, and you don’t have them.”
“I’m not starting a conventional business in Paris,” I say, “so, I don’t need a copy of a commercial lease agreement or proof of a credit balance from an account.” She takes a few moments to process this, but I can tell by her fidgeting that this situation is deviating from her script. This was probably above her pay grade to solve problems any more than a drive-thru clerk taking orders at a fast-food joint where you can’t have it your way. I give her a curious look that means, “Surely, you’ve dealt with other Profession Libérale visa applications in the past.”
“Since you don’t have the paperwork — even if you say you don’t need them — I can’t cross this off the checklist on the computer, so it won’t show that the application is complete,” she says. “So for me to send the application, I need to write a note.”
I want to pull the good ol’ American I’d like to speak to your supervisor, please, but I don’t want the VFS office to spit in my soup and sabotage my chances for approval. I bite my tongue instead, and tell eight-year-old me, “we’re going to have to trust the process.”
“But I walk out of the office with a massive knot in my stomach, “ I told Anne.
“It’s gonna be great,” she reassures me. I roll my eyes, when I notice an email that just popped up in my in-box, entitled: MISSING DOCUMENTS. It’s from the French Consulate.
“I gotta go.” I hang up the phone. My stomach is in knots again.
I close my eyes, take three deep breaths to keep me from going nuclear, and then open the e-mail.
Please provide the following documents in order to complete processing for your visa application:
- Your last 3 months’ bank statements showing your full name and enough funds to pay for your trip and expenses
- Proof of income related to your business activity in France (letter containing draft work contract with remuneration indicated)
- A housing lease or your host’s property deed
Please carefully read the following instructions on how to respond to this email:
- Please scan these documents directly back to this e-mail address in the next 7 days. Send them all in one email.
- Do not send the documents you already provided at your VFS appointment. We have already reviewed those and have deemed them to be insufficient or inadequate. If you send the same documents again, your visa will likely be denied.
- Only send your documents once and please refrain from writing to inquire if we received your documents. Too many e-mails received disrupt the organization of the visa department and result in longer processing times for applications.
Imagining being spoken by a French bureaucrat, I read the e-mail trying not to be annoyed by the surface politeness disguising the indifference, rigidity, vagueness, and trickiness, all of which French bureaucracy was infamous for. Too late.
“Nooooo!” I scream up to the sky. “I paid two grand for a service to deal with this! And now I have seven days to get the right docs!”
I’m livid. I leave the house for some air. I passed by my 95-year-old grandma in the living room reminding myself that I had yet to tell her I was leaving for Paris.
Why was I so incensed? Before I submitted the application back in September, I scheduled a one-hour consultation call with Franceformation to review my application, but in the actual call, she didn’t review or comment on any of the other parts of my visa application except for the business plan. The entire reason I paid her the exorbitant fee sight unseen was for her allegedly expert eyes to ensure my entire application was foolproof from top to bottom, not just the business plan. I emailed her a message expressing my concern. This was her response:
“ Your supporting documents are fine. Your business plan needs some serious work if you would like it to be accepted in a visa application. I would strongly advise against submitting it without taking into account many of the recommendations I made on our call. Please note that the guarantee included with your package is that I would help you revise and review your visa application again if it does not get approved the first time (this has never happened to any of my clients who followed the Complete French Business Incubator process). If you do not take into account any of my recommendations prior to submitting your application, I will not be providing additional feedback if it is rejected.”
As you can see by the Consulate’s e-mail above, they approved my business plan, which to be clear, I revised on the astute suggestions of expats from Facebook and other friends with expert knowledge, NOT incorporating any of Franceformation’s notes, which were similar in tone and expertise to the kind of advice my father gave me as a 13 year-old regarding how to throw a fastball, having only read a library book called The Official Little League Way to Play Baseball and watched baseball on TV but had never actually played baseball, because well, they didn’t have baseball in the Philippines when he was a kid.
Note that Franceformation stated my “supporting documents are fine,” yet based on the Consulate’s email of my MISSING DOCUMENTS, my supporting documents were clearly NOT fine. Even if she was willing to provide additional feedback, based on every single interaction I had with her, odds were quite high that she was not going to put in the work into my documents besides insisting that her advice was correct, which she was/is infamous for doing on her Facebook group, where, whenever comments go off script, they get deleted.
Thanks to the generosity and experiences of the expats on the Facebook group pages and the TAIP Facebook community, I was able to decipher the Consulate’s requests. My landlord didn’t have immediate access to the property deed, so I sent copies of her electric bill and property tax documentation instead. As far as proof of income, I whipped up contracts with my current clients.
Because I wasn’t confident they would get the stamp of approval, however, until my visa was in my hand, my brain simply would not commit to expending concentrated energy on the move. Even being only five weeks out, I put off my Paris to-do list and allocated most of my time either continuing my Goodbye L.A. tour or being a Dodger fan watching every inning of their playoff games either on TV or watching games at Dodger Stadium until they finally lost in the National League Championship Series, which I secretly hoped would happen, because Dodger baseball alone ate up at least sixty hours. I spent sixty hours training tennis at Silva Tennis Academy as well.
Every day, I’d spend hours checking my email and social media accounts for signs of my ex-girlfriend Sarah, hoping that she’d get in touch with me to see each other before leaving for Paris. It was horribly co-dependent of me, but that’s what it was.
Live music ate up another sixty hours, because with all the deaths, Covid, and purging that had happened this year, live music was my church. In addition to a series of local acts at the Hotel Café, I saw Pearl Jam and the Lumineers a few weeks ago and saw Wilco twice in October. The lyrics from “ Shot in the Arm,” Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm, and What you once were isn’t what you want to be anymore… totally encapsulated why I was moving to Paris. I played that song every day on repeat as I waited for my visa…
The consulate sent me an e-mail merely notifying me that a FedEx package was on its way to me. They didn’t indicate whether my application was approved.
No matter. The most important FedEx package of my life containing the prospects of my future is due to arrive in my lap in less than three hours. I’ve cleared my entire schedule for the day to be home to sign for the package. After a couple hours go by, I receive a text that FedEx tried to deliver the package, but I was not home, and they would attempt a second delivery the following day. Actually, I am home, but they didn’t bother to call. I want to scream.
What occurs next is a series of tragically comedic events in which I talk to three different customer service representatives for over five cumulative hours — all outsourced to call centers in other countries merely reading a script — to directly manage the delivery. I don’t trust their delivery process. The next morning, I drive fifteen miles to the FedEx facility.
Finally, the moment of truth is in my hand. It is anti-climactic, really, this nondescript FedEx envelope that held the promise of the rest of my life. I rip open the envelope. There’s nothing inside except my original passport. I brace myself for rejection and get ready to tell my inner child a narrative that the Universe is telling us it isn’t yet our time for Paris, then get my assistant director part of my brain to get past the disappointment quickly in order to plan for potential scenarios. I open the passport…and there it is, my profession libérale visa. I break into tears of relief and joy. It’s happening. I’m finally going to Paris. I am officially thirty days out.
I call Anne back. “Okay, now I’m excited.” “But just a little,” I added.
After I got my visa, urgency was everything. I booked my flight for November 16, four weeks from that moment. I secured a place for my cat Maddey on the plane. I confirmed my Airbnb reservations. I reviewed the procedures to obtain Maddey’s health certificate. I finally took the new suitcase I bought months ago out of the shipping box and laid it out with my two other suitcases.
Twenty days before my November 16th flight, my grandma was in the kitchen eating a Filipino dish of cow liver and rice when I finally told her I was moving to Paris. “Huh? Where are you going?” she asked in her shrill — Filipina from the poor province — laden accent. Her hearing was severely diminished, and she was too stubborn to wear a hearing aid.
“Paris,” I said.
“Where?”
“Paris.”
“Where?”
“France.”
“Frince?”
“France.”
“Frunce?”
“FRANCE.”
“Oh. France. That’s far.”
“Yes it is.”
“How long you going?”
“I’m not sure. A long time, probably.”
“Three months?”
“Probably longer.”
“Oh, so you don’t stay here anymore?”
“No, grandma.”
She started laughing. “Oh, maybe you stay there for a year!” More laughing. I wasn’t sure why she found all of this funny, but I said, “Yes, grandma, for a year.” And with that, she went back to the TV and started flipping channels. In retrospect, I don’t think she knew how to process the news that I was leaving. She was incapable of processing with nuance. At least outwardly.
After my mom’s stroke this year and enduring the trauma of not being given the chance to reconcile my relationship with her, I moved in with my grandma as a sentimental gesture to connect and say farewell after I was forced to leave the home Sarah and I made together. Grandma is 95 years old, and she just isn’t moving well anymore. We have cousins and aunts who will look after her, but I’m the grandchild of two closest to her. My sister lives two hours south in San Diego but she has her hands full. Besides, my grandma doesn’t trust my sister after the way she handled the responsibility as the executor of the power of attorney over my mom’s affairs. I feel horrible that I’m leaving grandma for Paris, but everyday I’m here, I’m losing more of my sanity, and I simply need to leave if I’m going to stay alive. Not kidding. I gave her a hug, she hugged me back, and as my emotions started to stir and make me feel raw again, I disappeared into the garage with my nose back to the grindstone and turned on a little Wilco to get me through a tedious night of deciding what was going to make it into the five pieces of luggage that would be my Paris life.

INTRODUCTION
Paris, the City of Lights. Many couples’ idea of a romantic location. So why is it the only city on my sh*t list, then?
Read on to find out.
ARRIVING IN PARIS
I was traveling with my girlfriend. Paris was one of the cities on our itinerary. we had three days and three nights to spend there.
This was an easy and unchallenging environment for us to visit as tourists, for a number of reasons. First, I’m a native French speaker, and she happened to be fluent in the language as well, having completed her high school studies in an international French school.
Second, we were both from so-called Western countries, so already somewhat familiar with French food and customs.
So what could go wrong, right?
THE EXPERIENCE THAT LEFT ME UNIMPRESSED
After we’d checked into our hotel we went out walking around our neighborhood to find somewhere to eat dinner.
I can’t remember where we ended up exactly, but it was something like a pub. I recall that it was somewhat dark and there was a bar close to the entrance. Whatever we ate was okay, but completely forgettable. Somewhat pricey, but not unexpected given that this was Paris.
We finished eating around 8:00–8:30 p.m., a pretty typical time for dinner by French standards.
Then came time to pay. Our bill cost 35 EUR (around US$50, at the time), and I gave a 100 EUR note. It took the cashier/bartender a good minute to figure out how much change to give me, and that’s including using a calculator! UGH.
I had always heard, in the news and from French people I’d met personally (like at my French meetup group, for example) that the French High School curriculum was more advanced in math and science than the North American one. So this was a little shocking, but I chalked it up to her perhaps having had a long day and simply being tired.
But what sealed the deal in terms of making this a bad experience for us, was that she proceeded to tell us that they didn’t have enough change for us (and bear in mind that this restaurant was still open and accepting customers - it’s not like it was the end of the day for them.)
And, so, another employee had to run out to a little shop across the street to get change. He came back about five minutes later, at which point we were finally able to get on with our evening.
Pretty lame.
THE EXPERIENCE THAT LEFT US DISGUSTED
We wanted to visit the famous Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral, so we hopped onto the metro and exited at the stop nearest to the cathedral. This station was located only a few minutes away from it by foot. It was busy and situated in a very popular, highly visited tourist area.
In this case, our dismay came from the general state that the metro station and its immediate surroundings were in. There was a smell of pee as we were walking out and around to the front. We spotted some big rats foraging, used condoms and empty alcohol bottles on the ground, and possibly a homeless problem in the area. The whole place basically gave the impression that it was generally very dirty and unkept-looking.
Enough said.
THE “DON’T BELIEVE THE HYPE” EXPERIENCE:
It was time to have dinner again. and we had made our way to a restaurant that I had found during my initial research and planning stage, prior to landing in the country.
It was a highly-rated mid-range restaurant owned by a famous chef. We chose one of the signature dishes. All I remember is that it had l some lobster in it… might have been a bisque. It cost us somewhere around 50 EUR.
The taste was underwhelming at best and the serving size was very small. More like an appetizer, despite being listed as a main. I was still very hungry afterward and ended up going to a bakery nearby to buy a couple of croissants to eat as soon as we left the restaurant.
What a rip-off, in taste AND in price!
THE “WATCH OUT FOR THE UNCIVILIZED CROOK” EXPERIENCE:
It was the afternoon, probably on Sunday during our 3-day long weekend trip to Paris. We were about to get on the Metro, after having spent a minute asking for directions from the booth attendant who worked right next to the entrance gates.
We’d purchased our one-way tickets, at an exorbitant price of 5 EUR each. I seem to remember that the price was perhaps a little higher on weekends, for some reason.
So my girlfriend went through the turnstile entrance and waited for me on the other side. There were a couple of people in front of me and then came my turn. I put in my ticket, started pushing the rotating metal bars, and immediately felt someone shoving themselves behind and pushing me to try and go through at the same time.
This French man must have noticed that we were tourists beforehand, and thought that he could get away with it as I would be caught by surprise and wouldn’t be able to speak up in French either…
Wrong on both counts.
I immediately turned around, looked at him, and pushed him back solidly with an open hand while exclaiming something like “What the hell are you doing?!” in French. He was definitely taken aback, clearly unused to people preventing his little scam from working.
I joined my girlfriend and we walked a few meters down the tunnel. we came to a split and were unsure which direction to take so we stopped to look at our subway map, which I think was in the form of a smartphone APP that I had.
Shortly after, the same man who had tried to scam his way in for free caught up with us and started yelling some insults at me and acting like he wanted to fight. I yelled something back along the lines of “What’s your problem?” while taking my backpack off and putting it down in case he was going to try to swing at me.
He was still standing at a distance of about 3 meters away, and, at that moment, a random man who was passing by and had noticed this idiot’s behavior told him to calm down and not get involved like this with tourists, or some such.
Lucky for him. My girlfriend had witnessed everything that had happened up to this point and she knew that this guy was in the wrong. We certainly weren’t looking for trouble, but I would have been fully in my right to defend myself had I needed to.
THE “YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME” EXPERIENCE:
It’s the afternoon and we were on our way to someplace called The Museum of Magic. it was around 2 p.m. and we had been walking for a while.
I was getting hungry. We spotted a nice-looking café and stepped inside to see if I could grab a snack. The place was packed and there literally was nowhere to sit So I had to take my food to go. I bought two slices of coconut cream pie.
We stepped back outside and I proceeded to eat the pie on our way to the museum and drank some bottled water as usual. We had a good visit to the museum but, shortly after getting out, I started feeling ill in my stomach.
We ended up having to rush back to our hotel room, and I proceeded to be sick from food poisoning for the rest of the day, being unable to go out until the following morning.
Now… I’m not sensitive, don't have any allergies, and can eat just about any food. And there was absolutely no doubt in my mind that what made me sick was the coconut pie that I had gotten in the middle of the afternoon from that busy café.
And up to that point - in fact, up until now - this is the only case of food poisoning I’ve ever gotten during my travels as a tourist. And this includes visiting various cities in Asia and Europe, where I ate my way through night markets and other street foods, among other things.
CONCLUSION
In any city around the world and particularly those where tourism brings in a lot of revenue, you would expect that the city’s management, its businesses, and its people would do the best they can to put a good foot forward and make the best first impression possible on tourists. Especially when talking about such a high-profile city as Paris.
Unfortunately, however, this isn’t what I noted when I was there. instead, I experienced quite a few distinct bad things in the same, short 3-day weekend time frame.
Rather disappointing, wouldn’t you say?
And this is why Paris is, to this day, still the one and only foreign city on my sh*t list. I will never set foot there again, although I wouldn’t be opposed to going back to a different area of France if the opportunity presented itself at some point in the future.
Q. have you had bad travel experiences?
All the best,
Pascal

Helping You Adapt to Life in France

I’ve lived in France on and off since 2014. I’m often asked, “How did you do it?” The short answer is a lot of determination and a refusal to take non as an answer. But, I know a lot of our TAIP readers hope to live in France permanently one day (or are already here and want to know how to stay), so I want to share, step-by-step, my own journey to France and how I made it all work.
Let’s get right into it.
I never imagined I’d ever study abroad, never mind live abroad. One day, when I was still in Rhode Island completing my undergrad, a friend of mine had to pick up some paperwork from the study abroad office. We had plans after so I decided to tag along. While I waited for her, an advisor approached me and asked if I was interested in learning more about my options. I shrugged and said, “Why not?” (if you’ve been in France a while, you’ll also find that this is a very frequently used idiom that indicates French willingness to try something new…another topic for another article) and joined him in his office.
I was studying fashion merchandising at the time, so after taking a look at my transcript he told me that my best options would be Milan or Paris. Was I interested in leaving for an entire semester? (no). Okay, how about the J-term in between the fall and spring semesters? (maybe…). He started pulling out pamphlets and I absentmindedly leafed through them.
At the time, I had a steady job at a local boutique and a long-term boyfriend. I thought all of that was way too important to leave, even for just a few months. But, as the advisor continued to sell me on my options (do these people get a commission on sign-ups or something?) I slowly started to warm up to the idea. He asked me again, “Milan or Paris?” Without really thinking about it I said Paris — I’d seen movies, read books, heard about the French capital. I knew what it looked like at least, as compared to knowing nothing about Milan — a few taps on his keyboard as he took a closer look at my transcript and he told me that if I wanted to graduate on time, a full semester was my best bet. “What do you think?”
Again, without really thinking about it I said, “Okay. How do I sign up?”
I didn’t even have a passport at the time and thoughts of my job and boyfriend fluttered through my mind; to be honest, even to this day I don’t know what made me say yes. Unlike some expats, I never had a lifelong dream of living in Paris, and yet, something urged me to do that semester abroad back in 2012.
I ended up having the best six months of my life, completely fell in love with the city, French culture, the food… I’m sure half of my readership knows exactly what I mean. A group of four of us even ended up staying for an extra month down in Cannes because none of us were ready to leave. Alas, I did have to go back to the US to finish my undergrad, and that I did. Dreams of living in France full-time slowly but surely disappeared as I slipped right back into my former life. I graduated, got promoted at the boutique, and moved into a new apartment with my best friend. Life was “good,” though I couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right.
In the winter of 2013 I was still working at the boutique and was, to be frank, miserable. So what do miserable people do when they’re bored at work? They scroll through Facebook, naturally. A message popped up — it was from a girl whom I studied abroad with who had never left after our semester. She decided to stay to be an au pair with a Franco-American family because she wasn’t ready to go back to the US.
We were just chatting, catching up, when my curiosity got the best of me. “How were you able to stay?” I asked. Was it difficult? I can’t stop thinking about Paris myself…
She filled me a bit and then told me that in fact, she planned on leaving her au pair position in May of next year. She loved the family (and had been with them since June 2012. It was November 2013 at this point) and was helping them find her replacement. She ultimately wanted it to go to someone she knew — she really cared about the kids — was I interested? I hesitated. Maybe. I told her I’d think about it.
Life got busy with the upcoming holiday season and I soon forgot about the conversation. Fast-forward to March 2014 and my friend messaged me again. Did I have time to think about coming back to France as an au pair? The family still hadn’t found a replacement. Like most young women my age, I had plenty of babysitting experience and I even nannied for a few summers when I was a student.
Just like that fateful moment in the study abroad office a year and a half earlier, without really thinking about it, I said, “Okay. What’s next?”
While I’m the first to admit that I stayed in my English-speaking-au-pair bubble for longer than I maybe should have, living and working in France was much different than studying abroad. I had to navigate French culture much more often (I was living with a French person and French children, after all), and learning how to adapt was difficult at times.
I was often homesick after the first six months and the initial excitement wore off — I also struggled to find a core group of friends. But, I did adapt, grow, learn, and eventually, thrive. My years as an au pair were some of my favorite that I spent in Paris and when I did find my people I felt like I truly belonged.
The caveat(s)? I still couldn’t speak French, my au pair contract was running out, I knew I didn’t want to work in fashion anymore, and I also knew I wasn’t ready to go back to my life in Rhode Island.
I had to figure out a way to stay.
Well, I did figure it out, but that story will have to wait until Part 2.

Caroline Giddis walks us through French fashion at the height of “La Parisienne.”
By Caroline Giddis, Curatorial Research Associate, High Museum of Art
Paris, the City of Light, was one of the first cities in Europe to install gas streetlamps to illuminate the ever-expanding streets and sidewalks. This new urban development initiative, which began in the 1860s, shed light on new city blocks of ornate Haussmann architecture and allowed city-goers to remain in the streets longer after sunset. What these gas lamps also achieved was extending the lifespan and visibility of a nineteenth-century Parisian woman’s outfit.
While Paris is the pinnacle of luxury fashion and accessories today, this tradition of exceptional craftmanship dates to the reign of Louis XIV, the “Sun King” (1638–1715), and his finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619–1683), who set a precedent for manufacturing and style that would continue through the centuries. Nineteenth-century Parisian fashion was no exception. In the exhibition In the City of Light: Paris, 1850–1920, several works depict women and their attire, whether they are strolling the streets, attending a performance, or serving as the model for a portrait. Using a selection of these works from the exhibition, which range from 1860 to 1913, we can explore the world of nineteenth-century fashion to expand upon the evolutions of the stereotype of La Parisienne, clothing manufacturing and shopping habits, and the center of fashion influence: the stage.
La Parisienne — A Cultural Icon
In the popular early twentieth-century magazine of fashion plates, Le Journal des Dames et des Modes (1911–1914), French poet and playwright Pierre Veber (1869–1942) contributed the guidelines for achieving elegance, writing, “Elegance resides in the perfect harmony of thoughts, words, acts, gestures, attitudes, and costume. It is through costume that elegance expresses itself most quickly.” [1] In Veber’s opinion, the fastest and surest way to project oneself as an elegant person was by dressing the part. The literary figure and “type” that embodied these pillars of elegance in French society was La Parisienne, in which Jean-Désiré Ringel d’Illzach found inspiration enough to create his Petite Parisienne sculpture in 1883.
This figure is dressed in quintessential early 1880s style: a slender silhouetted skirt; a jacket with a form-fitting bodice over a cuirasse corset and high collar, slim, three-quarter-length sleeves; and ruffles, lace, and frills from head to toe. [2] From the side, her large ruffled bustle and train, which she holds in her left hand, are noticeable. No costume was complete without a headpiece, and here La Parisienne is shown with a bonnet trimmed with ribbon and flowers and tied neatly under her chin.
This ideal woman embodied the highest tiers of elegance, wealth, and personal accomplishment of the age. Dressed in haute couture from Parisian couturiers such as Charles Frederick Worth and Paul Poiret, La Parisienne was a walking advertisement for the consumer economy of fashion and accessories. Her fellow Parisians could alternatively visually consume her impeccable fashion at the theater, opera, soiree, or on the newly paved boulevards. La Parisienne was a symbol of both national superiority and ideal femininity. [3] d’Illzach’s Petite Parisienne is composed and elegant — the sculptural rendition of a fashion plate.
Paul César Helleu’s Young Woman Looking in a Mirror (ca. 1895) is another example of the impeccable style of La Parisienne and her careful attention to her appearance. Styling a mid-1890s costume, she wears a high-necked dress or shirtwaist under a layered cape. Capes were highly fashionable during this period because they sat nicely over the ever-growing puff or gigot sleeve. She wears a straw hat trimmed with ribbons and flowers, and her hair is only half-pinned up, leaving a long braid trailing down her back, which was uncommon at this time but emerged as a stronger trend toward the 1900s. [4] Because Helleu’s sketch captures this woman’s private toilette, she may be intending to pin the braid up, but it’s unlikely as she already has on her hat and cape. Helleu depicts her right before the most important moment in fashion, when La Parisienne steps out into the streets of the city.
Street Style at the Turn of the Century
Nothing projects the sophistication, superiority, and luxury of a Parisienne quite like the subject of Jacques-Henri Lartigue’s photograph taken on the affluent Avenue du Bois de Boulogne in 1911. Donned in a wide-brimmed hat, fur coat and stole, ornately trimmed dress, and boots, accompanied by her two pure-bred dogs, she emanates elegance. The streets of Paris, then as today, serve as their runway.
Achieving this look did not come quickly, easily, or cheaply. Couture, and later haute couture, was the ultimate status symbol [5]. Wearing a custom-made garment by Worth, Poiret, or Jacques Doucet demonstrated the unique taste of the woman wearing it and the craftsmanship of the maker, but it also often flaunted the wealth of her husband or lover who could afford to dress her in such a manner. Explaining the power of couture, Valerie Steele writes in Paris Fashion: A Cultural History (2017), “Fashion served both to maintain hierarchy and to weaken it — as anonymous individuals were increasingly judged on the basis of their appearance.” [6]
As the Third Empire emerged in the 1870s, so did confection, or ready-made fashion, which first arrived in small luxury shops and later became the cornerstone of department stores. [7] By manufacturing clothing at affordable prices, fashion found democratization. Dressing in the latest modes no longer belonged solely to the wealthy. The woman featured on Lefèvre’s poster advertisement (1897) sports a common tailor-made ensemble of the late 1890s with a skirt, a blouse over a straight-front corset, and a gigot-sleeved jacket. [8]
The production of fashion affected the consumption of it. Browsing multiple options of ready-made items made shopping a more popular leisure activity, a scene that appealed to artists who captured modern life. In an illustration for the magazine Gil Blas Illustré (1900), Théophile-Alexandre Steinlen shows a Parisienne deciding between two feather-plumed hats at the milliner’s shop while a display of various trimmed caps sits in the background. This scene could also be taking place at a millinery stall in a department store.
Department stores such as Le Bon Marché and La Belle Jardinière revolutionized shopping by introducing a one-stop shop the size of a city block for clothing and accessories. Providing a visual feast of window displays, department stores appealed to passersby and reduced the number of visits a woman had to make while running errands. [9] While window displays, accessibility to fashion, and haute couture strutted through the streets created a web of influence on trends in Paris, one figure held more influence than all others — the actress.
Early Fashion Influencers
Nineteenth-century writer Octave Uzanne (1851–1931) reflected, “An ancient fashion is always a curiosity. A fashion slightly out of date is an absurdity; the reigning fashion alone, in which life stirs, commands us by its grace and charm, and stands beyond discussion.” [10] No fashionable Parisian woman wanted to be caught in a slightly out-of-date outfit, but the hunger for the latest looks reached a fever pitch during the reign of stage actresses such as Madame Réjane (Gabrielle Charlotte Réju, 1856–1920) and Sarah Bernhardt (Henriette-Rosine Bernard, 1844–1923). [11] Because actresses purchased their costumes for certain roles, they wanted the very best to wear both on and off stage, visiting only the most excellent couturiers for their dresses and suits. Madame Réjane, sketched by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec around 1899, favored the couturier Doucet, while Sarah Bernhardt often preferred Worth but refused him exclusivity. Once one of these iconic women wore a Doucet or Worth design during a performance, department stores began copying and producing ready-to-wear versions within days. [12]
This celebrity-imitation method of fashion trendsetting is no different from modern day. When popular stars like Hailey Bieber or Taylor Swift wear a couture designer dress that garners attention, fast-fashion stores manufacture an affordable copy available by the next week, if not sooner. The desire to look just like the most beautiful, talented, and admired figures remains the same.
The Fashion Capital Reigns
For many women of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the figure to emulate remained La Parisienne. The classic, sophisticated, never-over-done vision of elegance, the Parisian woman remains a mythologized icon to aspire to. With 1.3 billion views on TikTok videos tagged with #parisianstyle and #parisianaesthetic, fashionistas achieve the look of a composed, sophisticated urbanite of the French capital. The seventeenth-century origins of French style continue to peek through, however, especially during Paris Fashion Week as fashion houses and designers — the modern couturiers — debut their latest collections in the city’s most historically decadent sites. Many of those same locations served as the first runways for Les Parisiennes promenading in the nineteenth century, underscoring that fashion itself may evolve, while the flow of inspiration between the city and its clothiers remains as powerful as ever.
Absorb the full scope of Parisian fashion and influence in the High’s exhibition In the City of Light: Paris, 1850–1920, on view until December 31, 2023.

The view of Paris from Montmartre is one of the most breathtaking sights in the city — a sea of slate rooftops and white buildings, scattered with recognizable landmarks, green spaces and other details like islands among its waves.
But how long has it looked like this?
Last weekend, a friend from the US was standing with me at the top of Montmartre. “What was the view like when Van Gogh was here?” he asked. “Was it mostly fields?”
I told him that it wasn’t — Paris has been a fairly large city for centuries and by the 1880’s, when Vincent Van Gogh was living in Montmartre, it was a huge sprawl of buildings, factories, avenues, the Seine, and several large parks. The view of Paris from Montmartre’s heights would at that time have been roughly the same as it is today.
As someone who loves Paris deeply, and has for most of her life, the appearance of the city during my favorite era of its history seems like a given. But I started to wonder what visual proof might exist to show someone that the view from Montmartre has remained roughly the same — not only from the time Vincent Van Gogh was living there, but also from the time of the 1870–1871 Siege of Paris, sixteen years earlier.
My search for answers has taken me on quite the journey these past few days, revisiting beloved images and discovering or re-examining others. Although I’m left with a few lingering questions, I hope that I’ve been able to put together a good collection of visuals that show what the view from various sides of the Butte (hill) Montmartre was like in the 1880’s and in 1870 and 1871.
The view of central Paris from Montmartre in the 1880’s
Let’s start with the 1880’s, since that was the era my friend asked about.
Vincent Van Gogh lived in Montmartre from 1886 to 1887 or 1888, fifteen years after the end of Hearts at Dawn (otherwise, I would have given my favorite artist a cameo in my book!). From what I’ve read in biographies on him, as well as in his published letters, Vincent — as he preferred to be called — found Paris inspiring, but also overstimulating and overwhelming. And it wasn’t always easy sharing the life of his brother and sister-in-law, whose apartment he was staying in.
Still, Vincent painted a number of canvases during his time here, including a few views of Paris. My favorite of these is Vue des toits de Paris (View of Paris Rooftops), painted in March or April, 1887 (a sketch version also exists).
I love that we know exactly where this canvas was painted: from the window of Vincent’s room at his brother’s apartment, on the 3rd floor of 54 rue Lepic. This building still stands today, and whenever I’m in Montmartre, I stop by to look at it and marvel that Vincent once walked here on his way home.
The apartment is privately owned, so unfortunately you can’t go inside, but apparently some scholars have been allowed to. One of them shared in a blog post that the view from Vincent’s old window has, sadly, changed, with new buildings blocking the glimpse of Paris that he immortalized (you can see the current view from the window here).
Another of Vincent’s paintings from this time is usually given the similar title The Roofs of Paris. This time, we get an unobstructed view of central Paris, looking south from the summit of Montmartre.
Even today, this view from the southern side of Montmartre is the most famous one, since it offers an immense vista of the city below. As you can see in this cropped version of the photo at the beginning of this blog post, which I took from the summit of Montmartre last weekend, barring some additions like the occasional skyscraper, the Paris cityscape has remained more or less the same.
Vincent’s painting is of course an artistic interpretation — like many who’ve painted and sketched this breathtaking sight, he seems to emphasize recognizable monuments like Notre-Dame and the Panthéon, when in reality they probably looked at least a little smaller because they were far away. But I think it shows something about that excitement of being able to spot them and recognize them — like seeing friends in a crowd.
I also think the way he seems to have brought the city closer than it would have actually appeared could be a sign of that connection with others that he always sought. Or maybe it’s just his artist’s eye, knowing the precise way to frame the image and emphasize what’s needed.
Here’s another photo I took from the summit of Montmartre, looking slightly westward, cropped as closely as I can get it to Vincent’s painting:
Here’s the same image, with Notre-Dame and the Panthéon, the two most recognizable landmarks in Vincent’s painting circled:
As we can see, in the 1880’s, Paris was already a large, dense city. But this blog focuses on Paris during the Siege, in 1870–1871, so you might be wondering what was the view from Montmartre was like then.
The view of central Paris from Montmartre in 1870–1871
Between the 1870’s and 1880’s, some parts of the world experienced immense growth. For instance, my friend is from Colorado and I could imagine a frontier town changing a lot in those ten years. But in 1870, Paris looked pretty much the same as it did in the mid- to late 1880’s.
Of the things that had changed about the landscape, most would have been hard to spot from this towering vantage point, where so much is lost in that sea of slate roofs and white facades.
But one sure constant is that Paris was already a built-up city, especially in its central areas, and had been for decades.
For instance, in this 1862 caricature by Daumier of the famous pioneering photographer Gaspard Félix Tournachon, who went by Nadar (and who had recently invented aerial photography), we can see that the Parisian landscape below his balloon is packed with buildings, nearly to the horizon.
This is a caricature, of course, not necessarily a realistic depiction, but Paris had to be recognizable for it to work, so we can imagine that this is a fairly accurate impression of how the city looked from a high vantage point.
And in fact, here’s something that always amazes me: Some of Nadar’s aerial photographs, among the earliest in existence, still survive today. Here’s a view he captured of a part of western Paris. As you can see, certain sites are helpfully labeled…including a portion of the Butte Montmartre itself!
The photo is from 1858, four years before Daumier’s caricature. Yet even then, we can see a city that certainly has its green spaces (including the Parc Monceau, which plays an important role in Hearts at Dawn), but it’s very much already an urban landscape. And this isn’t even the heart of the city.
Another way to understand what Paris looked like in the 1870’s and ‘80’s is to look at maps.
Wikimedia Commons has a really cool collection of public domain maps of Paris throughout its history.
One of these maps, entitled “Le Paris de Napoleon III”, gives us an excellent overview of Paris in 1870.
At a glance, we can see one major difference compared to the Paris of today: the wall around the city. Known as the Thiers Wall (l’enceinte de Thiers), it was demolished in the 1920’s and ‘30’s. That said, as far as I can tell, there was no portion of the wall that would have been visible from Montmartre’s southern slope’s view onto the rest of the city, so it wouldn’t have influenced the famous view from the south side of the Butte.
Another difference that may be a bit more difficult to spot at first, especially if your computer is having trouble zooming in on the map, like mine was, is that the city is a bit less built up in certain areas, especially around most of its perimeter. That would probably give an overall impression of more greenery or space at the edges of the landscape than you’d see today.
Unfortunately, while we have drawings, paintings, and aerial views of Paris at this time, I don’t know of any photographs taken specifically from the summit of Montmartre with the intention of showing the view from its southern slope in the 1880’s or during the Siege of Paris. A big reason for this might be that photographic processes at that time couldn’t show distant landscapes in great detail.
But we’re lucky to have at least a few photos that were taken of people and a certain specific object on Montmartre in 1870 and 1871 that happen to give us at least a notion of the view from its slopes and summit.
This is due to the fact that Montmartre played an important role in the Siege and the Paris Commune (March 18-May 28, 1871), in two particularly notable ways:
1. It was the site of several balloon launches. Balloons are an iconic feature of the Siege of Paris, since they were the only (relatively) reliable means for Parisians to send messages to people outside the city walls — in fact, airmail was invented during and because of the Siege of Paris. Two of the balloon launches from Montmartre are especially notable: that of the Neptune, the first balloon launched during the Siege, and that of the Armand Barbès, which took Léon Gambetta out of Paris so that he could conduct government business and rally French troops on the other side of enemy lines.
Here’s a photograph by Nadar himself, showing the Neptune being prepared for flight, in the Place Saint-Pierre, the square at the base of the Butte’s south side.
2. It was the location of a large canon depot (parc d’artillerie). Many of these canons had been funded by donations from Parisians to fight the Prussians. On March 18, 1871 (about a month and a half after the end of the Siege), the French government’s attempt to seize the cannons to hand them over to the Prussians as part of the terms of the treaty that ended the Franco-Prussian War was the event that ignited the Paris Commune, a period of civil war between the French government and the rebel Communards (most of them armed thanks to that same government, which had encouraged them to volunteer for the Garde Nationale during the Siege).
When I was researching Hearts at Dawn, I came across several photos and images of the canons on Montmartre. But I have to admit, while I know that they were stored on the southern side and possibly summit of the Butte, I haven’t been able to find out exactly where the depot was or its extent. Some sources make it seem as though it was on the summit of Montmartre — for instance, this very detailed sketch shows Saint-Pierre de Montmartre, the church that’s been on the butte’s summit for centuries before the construction of the Sacré-Cœur, just beside the cannon.
But others, like this photograph, suggest it also extended down along the slopes.
While researching this blog post, I also learned that the parc d’artillerie was where the cannons were stored, but they were then rolled to areas called batteries — outcroppings with good vantage points — where they were aimed and readied for firing.
I came upon this sketch by Gustave Doré, entitled Batteries sur les buttes Montmartre and dated March 6, 1871. In the sketch, we can see several spots where cannons were placed along the southern side of the hill.
As a point of reference, here’s roughly the same view today:
Back to the first two of these three historical images — what’s most important, for the purpose of this blog post, is what we can see in the background of each. In the background of photo of the parc d’artillerie, a dense mass of buildings makes up even this relatively small portion of the view towards Paris.
The sketch of the parc d’artillerie also suggests that immensity. Today, the dome of Les Invalides and the (then-new) Palais Garnier opera house are still easy to spot and loom fairly large among the rest of the cityscape. But I can’t vouch for the Arc de Triomphe being so noticeable, as I’ve never seen it from Montmartre’s heights. Like nearby monument The Eiffel Tower (which was constructed in 1889 and thus wouldn’t have been visible in the 1870’s or to Vincent when he was in Montmartre), it’s located in the western part of the city, a view that’s largely blocked by trees and buildings on and around Montmartre today.
You can see the Eiffel Tower, though, if you move a bit past the funiculaire. And according to this blog page, you can make out the Arc from the top of the dome of the Sacré-Cœur.
If you follow the link, you’ll see that the Arc de Triomphe is still pretty hard to spot, which makes me wonder if the artist of our sketch was just trying to emphasize it to give a reference point, or whether it might have been more noticeable because that area, while still pretty built up, as we could see in Nadar’s 1858 aerial photo, didn’t have quite as many tall buildings around it as it does today?
Where could you see the view from Montmartre in the 1870’s and 1880’s?
Speaking of vantage points, it would have been impossible to climb to the top of the Sacré-Cœur in 1870 or 1871, since its construction (started in 1875) wasn’t complete until the early 20th century. But the photographer and the draughtsman of our parc d’artillerie images are looking down on the summit, likely from the Tour Solférino, an observation tower that used to sit on the summit of the Butte. The tower’s two upper floors were demolished so as to be less of a potential target for Prussians during the Siege, and in 1874 it was demolished entirely.
You can see the lower portions of the Tour Solférino, as well get a general idea of what Montmartre’s summit looked like where the Sacré-Cœur now sits, in this painting from 1870. In it, Parisians are looking out over the city from what appears to be a makeshift observation platform. Note that while this artist wasn’t as focused on the details of the cityscape below, his use of grays and whites still suggests its size and density.
You can also get a very good overall impression of what the summit of Montmartre looked like in 1871 from Gustave Doré’s sketch of the batteries: The middle of the summit is a vacant space, with the church of Saint-Pierre on the left, and the Tour Solférino and some other structures on the right. In the center, we can see the tops of distant buildings set a bit further back on the heights of the Butte.
(Possibly) A view of western Paris from Montmartre in 1871
On the other hand, I have to confess that this photo of canons on Montmartre
is less easy to understand. The cityscape in the background doesn’t seem to be central Paris, since there are no noticeable landmarks and it looks more spacious and green. In the right corner is what seems to be a tree-lined avenue. There are no factory smokestacks, probably ruling out eastern Paris, as well as the landscape to the north of the city (a little more on those further on). I believe the batterie in this photograph may have been facing western Paris, but I can’t be absolutely sure.
Even though there are some very precise sources, like this webpage giving detailed information like where canons were kept in Paris and how many were at each site, nothing that I can find specifies how many batteries were on the slopes of Montmartre, or just how far around the hill they went.
(Probably) Views of eastern Paris from Montmartre in 1871
Fortunately, we have more precise information for these next images.
These photos date to the Commune (March 18 -May 28, 1871), and seem to show the same barricade on the Butte Montmartre (barricades were common in many streets of Paris during this time), taken at what appear to be slightly different times and angles.
The first is labeled as being on the rue de la Bonne:
while the second is labeled as being located at the intersection of the rue de la Bonne and the rue du Chevalier-de-la-Barre (then known as the rue des Rosiers, not to be confused with the rue des Rosiers in the Marais).
From what I can guess, the barricade could have been located near the intersection, in the present-day square Marcel-Bleustein-Blanchet, which overlooks northeastern Paris. But it’s also possible that it was at the actual intersection of these streets that we see on a map today; since the Sacré-Cœur wasn’t built yet, it might have been possible to get a relatively uninterrupted view of the city beyond, which would be impossible now. But since the Communards seem to be standing near the edge of the hill, my first guess seems more likely.
In both photos, the view of Paris is unfortunately a bit hard to make out in terms of details, but we can see a cityscape stretching out far to the horizon.
On the other hand, the location of the barricade and the fact that we can make out factory smokestacks and numerous green spaces make me even more convinced that this is a view from the eastern, not southern, slope of the Butte, which means this is a view of northeastern, not central, Paris.
This area was less developed and dense than the center, and many factories as well as parks like the fairly recently created Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, were located here. Even today, while eastern Paris is certainly more built up than it was in 1870–1871, many areas are still a bit more open than the center of the city.
The Butte Montmartre in the 1870’s and 1880’s
Montmartre is an iconic Parisian neighborhood today but for Parisians in 1870, it had only recently been incorporated into the City of Light, when the city officially added all or parts of surrounding villages to its borders in 1860. Before that, Montmartre was a village known for its windmills, taverns and guinguettes (beer gardens). After it became a part of Paris, this reputation was still upheld. It also was a pretty inexpensive place to live. With its cheap rents and unconventional attitude, artists began to flock to Montmartre’s slopes. Over the following decades, these included Vincent Van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, Picasso, Modigliani, and many others.
In the 1870’s and ‘80’s, some parts of Montmartre were somewhat built up. For instance, the building Theo Van Gogh (and, for that short time, Vincent) lived in looks like a perfectly normal 19th-century Parisian apartment building. (That said, Montmartre has never totally followed the rules — as its streets were being paved, many often caved in, due to the Butte itself being full of hollow spaces where plaster of Paris had been mined in previous centuries.) But just around the corner, dirt roads, shacks, and wooden dwellings cobbled together by amateur (albeit talented) builders were the norm.
This area roughly between the rue Lepic and the rue Caulaincourt was known as le maquis. The picaresque slum’s origins date to around the 1870’s or ‘80’s. Despite health and sanitation issues, including no running water or building safety standards, le maquis existed to some degree until as late as the 1940’s. You can see some fascinating photos of the maquis through the years here. Keep in mind that most, if not all, of these photos date to later than the Siege and Commune of Paris.
So, if you were looking at Montmartre itself in the 1870’s, you would see a hill dotted with structures like buildings and windmills, but also plenty of undeveloped areas, including a good portion of its summit. By the time Vincent Van Gogh was there, in the mid- to late 1880’s, the maquis would have been more noticeable, and the Sacré-Cœur would be under construction at the summit.
The view north of Montmartre in the 1870’s and ‘80’s
The northern side of Montmartre looks out over a little bit of the city but mostly beyond it, into the northern suburbs. In the 1870’s and ‘80’s, that view would look more like what my friend was expecting. Villages and towns to the north of the city had fields between them, as opposed to the relentless urban sprawl that you see today.
When researching this blog post, I was excited to come upon this 1874 sketch by Eugène Delâtre, which shows the view from the rue du Mont Cenis, a long road that runs down the Butte’s northern slope. In the distance, we can see factories and villages, but also some green spaces.
This is the most radically different view from the Butte Montmartre. Here’s how it looks today — a vast urban sprawl:
A view out of time
Back to our most famous vista: central Paris, seen from the south side of the Butte Montmartre.
Because some areas of Paris were less developed than they are today, the overall landscape in the 1870’s and 1880’s might look slightly less dense, something that most of the visual sources here seem to confirm.
But overall, as we can see from the images I’ve shared here, as well as what we can tell from sources like maps, guidebooks, contemporary novels, correspondance, and travelers’ accounts, Paris in the 1870’s an d’80’s looked, on a whole, very similar to Paris today, especially in the central parts of the city. The same can’t be said for the view from Montmartre’s northern side; today, the scattered albeit big towns have given way to a vast urban sprawl.
Of course, in the 1870’s and ‘80’s, there weren’t skyscrapers, the Centre Pompidou, or the Eiffel Tower (well, not until 1889) — all of which you can see from Montmartre today.
Another thing to consider is that what I’ve described here are the typical views you’d see on a typical day from the top of Montmartre. But I imagine there must have been times when observers in 1870 and 1871 could see some sign of the forts that surrounded the city firing, or some trace of battles in the northern suburbs. During the semaine sanglante (Bloody Week), in late May 1871, when the Communards were burning down landmarks and government buildings around the city, people could surely see clouds of smoke if they were looking down from the Butte. And I imagine its summit would have been an amazing place to observe the aurora borealis that appeared in the sky on October 24, 1870.
But despite all of this, while it certainly wasn’t exactly the same, the general view from Montmartre in 1870–1871 and in the 1880’s wasn’t dramatically different from what we see today. The city was still dense, especially its center, and you can still spot recognizable monuments like the Palais Garnier, Notre-Dame, and the dome of Les Invalides.
This similarity is one of the things that, to me, makes the spectacular view of Paris from Montmartre even more moving. When I look out at Paris from Montmartre, I am seeing the scope of a city of countless stories. I am seeing nearly the entirety of this enormous place that I love. And I am sharing that view with people from the past. Someone in 1870, a year I wrote about and studied and have grown to love, would see almost the same thing as I do now. For a moment, it’s like we’re standing together, suspended in time.

Paris. It is the heart of France. With fashion, gastronomy, arts, and architecture; here lies some of the most unique shopping, sculptures, and structures in the world.
When I first arrived in this beautiful city, I had no idea what to do with myself. There was so much to see, and only having two days booked here, I couldn’t imagine where to begin. Getting some advice, I realized I had to adapt to the local way of life alongside my sightseeing. Here, stopping for un Verre de Vin (glass of wine) is acceptable whenever you need a break. People-watching is a common sport as you relax on one of the many beautiful café terraces, and the people here give off such a relaxed vibe that you have to learn to just go with the flow.
So, I began my discovery of Paris in one of the most famous locations of the city Le Tour d’Eiffel. The Eiffel Tower. I decided I wanted to make the most of this part of my trip, so I went in the afternoon and stayed for the sunset. After entering the plaza, and getting my ticket, I chose to take my time and use the staircase to the top. There is an elevator option, but I thought back to some advice I had been given. Relax, take your time, and go with the flow. So, I took plenty of breaks on my ascent and enjoyed the views over the river Seine. When I finally reached the top, the sun was setting and I had the most majestic view. Standing there, watching the city slowly light up the night, was such a magical experience, I was left speechless. I truly thought there was nothing in the city to top this moment.
Well, was I wrong. After coming back down the tower, I saw a tour boat bobbing along the river Seine, and decided to jump aboard. Now, the view from the top of the Eiffel Tower was impressive and a unique way to see the city. But seeing the Tower herself, up close, and bright as a shining star at the end of the river, there are no words to describe this perfect scene.
I awoke the next morning eager to continue exploring. I walked from the Notre Dame, all the way up to the arc de Triomphe, visiting sights along the way. The metro runs all along this path, but again, meandering through the city seemed to be the best way to experience all Paris had to offer. On the way, I saw the Sainte Chapelle, Palais Royal, the Louvre, Orangerie, and the Place de la Concorde. My second day was filled with so much scenery, sightseeing, and shopping, I was exhausted. Finishing the evening watching a show at the Moulin Rouge before heading home to pack was such an entertainingly perfect way to finish my day, I knew I would jump at the chance to come back to this beautiful city.

How can Paris be the worst at anything? It is so beautiful. It is so historic. It has everything! All of that is true, but it is the worst to drive around. I drove over 6,700 miles across Europe, so I feel I have some experience in the matter.
Driving on the “other side” in the UK took some getting used to, but after a few days, it wasn’t so bad. Prague was a challenge because of all the trams that use the same roads as cars and all the cobblestone streets. Florence was tough because of the narrow one-way alleys. But Paris is on another level.
Sometimes there are dividing lines in the road, sometimes not. Sometimes other drivers abide by those lines, sometimes not. There are all sorts of twists and turns and one-way streets. There are underground tunnels with limited signage. There are cyclists and mopeds and motorcycles (and pedestrians!) weaving through traffic. Then, of course, there are crazy, multi-lane roundabouts like around the Arc de Triumphe.
I don’t think I would have been prepared to drive in Paris if it was our first stop. It was only because I had practice in other European cities (Rome, Madrid, Berlin, etc.) that I was able to make it through unscathed.

When I travel my main mission is to visit places in Paris that are not tourist traps. I want to experience a city like a local vs going to places frequented by and designed for tourists — one, because the quality may not be the same and two, you are most likely going to pay more for subpar quality. I, of course, will see any of the major attractions that are on my list to see, but as far as my dining and exploring go, would rather go to gastronomic musts and places off the beaten path, or at least the touristic beaten path. Also, coming from NYC I’m used to a certain level of service, as well as a certain type of charm. Living here for almost three years, I’ve discovered many gems. If you want to discover those gems, this guide is for you.
Image Source: PInterest
If you are visiting Paris, I suggest you stay central, or in the center circle of the arrondissement map above (basically arrondissements 1–9). Most likely you will want to hit some of the tourist attractions, and, if so, you want to be centrally located. I may be biased here, but I think the best place to stay is Saint Germain on the left bank. It’s just more picturesque and not as congested as the right bank, which is definitely more touristy. If you want to feel like a true Parisian and can secure a hotel or airbnb in the 6th or the 7th arrondissement, that is your best bet. If you prefer the hustle and bustle of Paris, I would do the 1st or the 8th for a more upscale feel or the 3rd or 4th for a more artsy vibe.
Pro-Tip: Renting an apartment in Paris is the best way to get the whole vibe of the city and is pretty cost effective compared to NYC. Also, the space will be bigger. Most Parisian hotel rooms are tiny, so if you don’t require all the creature comforts of a hotel, an apartment is truly the way to go!
Super Pro-Tip: For more affordable lodging and a less congested atmosphere, you can also stay along the borders of the hot neighborhoods, i.e. the 15th in the part bordering the 7th, or the 17th in the part bordering the 8th or the 11th in the part bordering the 3rd and the 4th.
So, you are in Paris, one of the culinary capitals of the world. One cardinal rule to remember, you seriously cannot get any bad food here. It is nearly impossible unless you go to somewhere on my avoiding list . And the lovely thing about Paris is you can eat anywhere based on your budget type and get a pretty solid meal. Here are my top three by category.
Traditional Paris Brasserie popular with the media types located in Saint Germain
What to get: Duck Confit, Baba au Rhum, Bottle of Chateauneuf du Pape
The brasserie where Keanu Reeves and Diane Keaton eat in one of my movie faves, “Something’s Gotta Give”
What to get: The hot foie gras, beef bernaise, bottle of the Gevry Chambertin
Where all the old artists like Hemingway, Cézanne and Wilde used to frequent. There are many seating options including an outside or indoor garden, main brasserie and piano bar
What to get: A gin or vodka martini to start, the foie gras, the lamb, crepes suzette flambé, any bottle of red
One of the best tasting menus I’ve had in my life and the priciest, but totally worth it. You can either do a land/sea tasting menu or a veggie tasting menu. Both are equally delectable. Alain Passard is a genius and usually visits each table during the dinner seatings. You can eat downstairs in the cave, which is more intimate (I did find out that this is where they usually seat the tourists, but it’s better IMHO). You can also request to sit upstairs if you want to be seated with the locals.
Amazing Japanese French Fusion Tasting Menu and one of the better tasting menus I have had in Paris. Space is small and minimalist, but food is amazing. There are 3 tiers-discovery standard and luxe. We did the luxe bc I really wanted the truffles but it was honestly too much food, for me at least!
One of the trendier tasting menus here in Paris so make sure to make your resis months out in advance. If you can’t snag a ressie for your stay, Frenchie Bar à vin is across the street from the main restaurant. They don’t take reservations, so make sure to show up a few minutes or half an hour before they open to snag a table. They serve AMAZING wine and tapas style dishes for dinner. If you happen to be just wandering in that neighborhood, Frenchie to go (another part of their family) is great for lunch and sandwiches to go.
Pro-Tip: Have the sommelier choose your wine when you do a tasting menu as they do know best. And, always do the wine pairing if that option is available.
Located down a side street where the 6th meets the 7th, this brasserie is charming and serves up some of the best southwestern French food you will eat in your life. All ingredients are locally sourced and the cheese and wine come from local shops from a few blocks away.
What to get: Foie gras (toast the bread with your private toaster), the duck confit or cassoulet and the cheese plate. Wash it down with some pinot noir or another red of your choosing.
Way down the beaten path in the heart of the 15th, this little restaurant is not one to miss. With a prix fixe menu that changes almost daily, you really are in for a treat. You get to choose a starter, main course and dessert for the small price of 39€ that is a steal since the food is Michelin Grade!
What to get: Menu changes daily, but get the foie gras for your starter if they have it as it is homemade. They also have bottles of the moment, which are usually treasures.
This restaurant is where French people go to dine and treat themselves. Comprised of a slew of great young talented chefs it is hard to go wrong. You can opt for their normal prix fixe set at 39€, or go all out with their 5 course tasting menu for 59€, both a steal for gastronomical dining!
What to get: Menu changes so if you do the normal prix fixe menu where you have a choice just ask for their reccommendations.
If you are hankering for a flavor of the Mediterranean, head over to Balagan. Vibe is trendy and fun and the cuisine is light yet filling.
What to get: Anything with zatar and the snickers dessert. Their international wine selection is a top on my list!
Craving Italian? For a nice cozy feel, head over to Cherche Midi on the street of the same name. Spot is a cute little neighborhood spot where mostly locals go. The food is pretty amazing and you won’t be sorry.
What to get: The lobster ravioli if they have it or any of their pasta/seafood dishes.
Japanese Fusion hot spot in the heart of Saint Germain. They don’t take reservations, so make sure to go either at the beginning of dinner service or towards the end of primetime dinner. If you are here in August, you will have no issue as most of the Parisians are on holiday.
What to get: The cocktails and a few small dishes to share.
So in Paris, you have two options — you drink wine like the french do (and seriously it’s a crime not to) or you drink cocktails. I like doing both. You can find and drink good wine anywhere, seriously, ANYWHERE — a cafe, a brasserie, even McDonalds, so I hear. But if you want to go to a true wine bar or have a real cocktail, read on.
For those of you who are truly french beginners — this is basically a bar for natural wines. Even though I am not a big bio wine fan, I don’t discriminate as they have pretty good wines here, as well as good vintages. They also have a location in NYC
This is a great lively joint in the 9th arrondissement. Love this place because you can either sit in a main bar, but if you prefer a more intimate setting you can book one of the underground caves and enjoy your wine and nibbles in there.
This is more of a brasserie, than a wine bar, BUT they make my list because they have a cellar of 250+ wines. The best is you can even buy a few bottles to take home.
Pro-Tip: If you are not looking for a full out wine experience you are best served going to a brasserie for apero hour, where the french enjoy a few nibbles (charcuterie and cheese plates, or as they call it “planche mixte”) with their apertif of choice.
Love, love , love the Ritz because it has as many bar options a girl can dream of! If you are going for a speakeasy vibe, you must try Hemingway Bar. Regardless of what you are looking for, you must try Hemingway Bar — their bartender is a legend in his field and the cocktails made there cannot be found anywhere else, including the other bars at the Ritz Paris. They also have two outdoor bars, which are lovely on a nice day or evening or a tea room where you can enjoy a proper tea and champagne.
If you are looking for somewhere off the beaten path and a night of surprises, head over to the Marais to this gem. Cocktails are curated in a special artist’s book that would make a nice addition to your coffee table collection. The vibe is fun and lively.
Wanting to hang in the left bank? Then head here for fantastic cocktails, a great vibe and amazing beats. They also make one of best sazeracs I have ever had.
Pro-Tip: If you really cannot live without a true cocktail, make sure NEVER, EVER, under any circumstances order a cocktail at a brasserie unless you want to be majorly disappointed. Always order your cocktail at a hotel bar, a cocktail club or one of the brasseries on this approved list.
If you are coming during the first of the month and the Louvre is on your list, entry is free the evening of the first Saturday of the month. Saying that, you can still purchase tickets for the VIP section so you don’t have to wait on the super long line. I personally find the Louvre overwhelming and find a guided tour better able to manage my visit — you can still wander around on your own after the guided tour if you wish. This two hour one is my favorite, and as an extra bonus you get to skip the line!
If you really have no interest in going to the top of the tower, and you just want to see it, head over to the steps of Trocadero, which is the best spot to see her majesty. If you do go in, enjoy a glass of champagne at the top or just book reservations at one of the restaurants to avoid the line completely.
Best time to go here is when it is a sunny day with no bad weather or the balcony/tower areas will be closed off. It’s also better and safer to wander the winding and steep streets of montmarte when it’s not raining or snowing.
You can actually climb to the top of the Arc if you just don’t want to be just another one of those tourists trying to get the perfect shot from the Champs de Elysée. I will warn you that this climb is not for the weak of heart — there are no elevators, the staircases are beyond narrow and the air quality leaves much to be desired.
Pro-Tip: If you happen to be touring Paris with a young one in a stroller, you are in luck. You can get to the front of any museum or tourist attraction line. I have often thought about buying a stroller and putting a baby doll in it just for this perk.
Totally innovative for Paris, this is definitely a must see. Imagine seeing works of art projected in a loft like space with music playing in the background. Book tickets way in advance especially if you are looking for Saturday/Sunday tickets, as this is when the French go with their families.
Pro-Tip: Book Friday evening tickets as they have a bar open during these hours
If you happen to be in Paris during Opera and ballet season, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing tickets to a performance.
Pro-Tip: For a more elegant feel and a true Opera experience, make sure to book at Palais Garnier. If you want more of a casual vibe, head over to Opera Bastille.
Taking a daytrip out of Paris is an easy thing to do whether you decide to go by train, car or uber. If you want to go north, take a train and check out the beaches of Normandy. If you want palaces and to see how the royals lived, head over to Versailles. Want to explore your artistic side? Head over to Giverny and get a little taste of Monet. Looking to get your drink on? The Champagne region is your best bet. The possibilities are endless.
Pro-Tip: If you are going somewhere not too far, totally worth it to check uber pricing. Sometimes it makes more sense than taking the train and is less stressful.
Versailles Pro-Tips: If you do Versailles, highly recommend doing a horseback excursion through the gardens before actually touring the Trianon and the Palace. It truly is an unforgettable experience. If you choose only to do the Palace, I would do the guided tour route like the Louvre, as it is massive!
Being one of the fashion capitols of the world, Paris is definitely somewhere to spend those dollars especially since you get your VAT back, which depending on the purchase, can add up to a lot. You can read more about shopping here.
One of my favorite things about Paris is shopping the Farmer’s Markets. The produce and quality of food here in France is superior to the US mostly anywhere, but there is something special about the farmer’s markets. It is more fresh because they make that morning drive with the produce for one and it feels great to support the local markets and smaller businesses.
Marche de Avenue Saxe (Thurs & Sat)
Bio Market Avenue Raspail (Sunday)
A trip to Paris is not complete without visiting a fromagerie. Even if you are staying at a hotel, you must visit a local fromagerie and do a sampling of cheeses. Love the cheese here vs. US because it is unpasteurized and the variety and the special types they make here are simply second to none.
Quatrehomme
Marie-Anne Cantin
Pro-Tip: You can also ask them to vacuum pack your faves for transport to the US. FYI-this is illegal and I’ve never done it, but if you want to try your luck with customs as many do, by all means, go for it!
To feel like a true Parisian just sit at a café in the afternoon or morning and just take in the beauty around you. If you are here for creative purposes, it is sometimes a nice treat.
Chai de l’Abbaye
La Varenne
Pro-Tip: At cafes, you can sit anywhere that is available. You do not need to be wait to be seated. If you do, it will tell them right away that you are a tourist! And if you don’t know French, no problem! Here’s a little cheatsheet that will help you get around.
Another great thing to do is just chill in the park. The lovely thing about Paris is that you can pretty much set up shop in any of the green spaces. The other great thing is there are no close rivals to the type of picnic assortments you can create here — foie gras, saucisson, fromage, wine, champagne…Create your own adventure and curate your basket to the nines!
Invalides
Saint Germain de Laye (outside of paris but def worth the uber ride)
Pro-Tip: Bring the wine. If you didn’t know, drinking outside is legal here, bien sûr!
Paris is truly one of the most beautiful cities in the world and true Parisians walk aimlessly everywhere. Sometimes it is nice to get just get lost wandering the side streets in Saint Germain and the Marais. My best discoveries in Paris have been made by accident! Best time to walk is in the morning before the sun gets too strong and in the evening after dinner to burn off all the calories you just consumed!
So, there you have it — your Parisian visit at your fingertips. Obviously, I have a long, long list of favorites, but we’d be here for hours if I published that! For the full list, click here and put “Paris list” in the additional info field. Until next time, happy exploring!

Paris — a city in France. It’s a place so magical, it sends Japanese tourists into an emotional tailspin, and not the good kind!
I recently saw a headline on the Matador Network, which has never accepted any of my travel writing pitches, that boasted “12 things I wish I knew before visiting Paris.”
When I saw that article, I thought, what a great idea! What better way to tell people you’ve been to Paris (France), while remaining humble and “down-to-earth” (only a real asshole would write an article called “12 Things I Already Knew Before I Went To Paris That Turned Out To Be Accurate,” right?)? (?)
That’s what I love about travel lists on sites like Matador. They’re so helpful! They help you (the reader, in need of information) and me (the writer, who needs to feel useful).
So here’s my take on such a unique concept, complete with not 12, but 13 things you should know before you go to Paris. Take it from me, because I already went to Paris.
As it turns out, “French” is more than a mustard — it’s a form of communication. Try as you might, you won’t get anywhere in this town if you don’t speak the language, as French people are notorious for surrendering upon realizing you speak a foreign tongue.
Before my trip, I read up on something called “cognates,” which are words that look and sound the same in different languages, and even have similar meanings. “Perfect.” I said. “This will help me get around the fact that I don’t speak mustard.”
But every time I went shopping in Paris and asked for a baguette to carry the cheap drawings of the Seine that I’d bought for one euro, people looked at me funny, and then gave me a long, oval-shaped piece of bread. It was the strangest thing! As it turns out, a “bag-ette” is not a small bag, but a type of baked dough. Not bad, but they can take awhile to hollow out.
Don’t light that part.
Throw off the chains of your prude American or British or whatever upbringing and be not afraid to drink wine — yes, white wine! — at a picnic with all of your male friends. Dudes do it all the time. It’s fine! No one thinks you’re gay, bro! And if they do, it’s Europe! I don’t know, maybe you should kiss that guy! I don’t care! Or maybe I do! Maybe I do care! But in a good way!
You thought you had style, or that you knew how to wrap a scarf around your neck, but you were wrong, and you don’t. Sorry, but you’re a peasant, and everyone knows just by looking at you.
Didn’t think I was gonna go there, did ya?
Does it seem like I’m just padding out this list? Yeah? Send me a picture of you hanging out with French President Emmanuel Macron. Until then, this one stays.
He’s not actually buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery. He lives on the moon with Tupac.
I’m dead fucking serious. Don’t order an espresso to sip at the espresso counter, and then when you see an open table, take your little-ass cup over to the table and sit there like it’s no big deal. That’s an extra half euro, or maybe a euro, and it will also cost you 1,000 Euro Cool Points, which can never be recouped.
I don’t want to have to tell you this again because it’s embarrassing when you say it wrong and I’m not going to spend my whole vacation correcting you.
Love is dead. And just because the light falls on the eaves a certain way, and the streets pulse with the sounds of a romantic mustard oozing from the lips of beautiful people, and the rivers ripple beneath your feet as you head to the middle of the bridge to affix a lock with your name and the name of some girl you met on Spring Break to the twisted metal for all eternity or until they are removed by sanitation, doesn’t mean you’re somehow exempt.
But it’s fine. They wash the streets every day, because French people are ridiculous. Just watch your step in the afternoon, or maybe it’s the morning, I don’t remember.
France may hold some deep meaning for you because you like Hemingway or Chanel, but as it turns out, more than 10 million people live in the city and its surrounding suburbs, and they could give a shit about your little fantasies. They have places to go and people to see. So stop trying to figure out how I screwed up when I went to Paris and go eat the liver of a duck that’s been force-fed corn like a good little tourist, okay?
I didn’t need to know anything different before I went there, actually. I fucked up a lot and that’s what travel is: fucking up and making the most of it. If you don’t have a bad meal, pay too much for a shirt, get stranded on the side of the road, offend a local, or fall asleep face down under a bridge at some point on your trip, you’re doing it wrong.
Hope this helps!

For me Paris is the most beautiful city in the world — the City of Lights, of History, Arts, the city of Culture. No other place offers so much to see and to do as the French capital. Just to start, there are 206 museums, 2,185 historic monuments, many opera houses, theaters everywhere, the best restaurants in the world, charming bars and cafes and luxury shopping like nowhere else. Paris deserves time, and many visits. You can’t do it just once, or in few days.
Which is exactly why so many tourists visit the city — all the time, in great numbers, non-stop. My father, who also loved Paris, once said that Parisians are accused of being rude, but that, in fact, “they are just tired of being visited for centuries”. Indeed.
And right now tourists are coming in greater numbers, despite the terrorist attack of November 2015 and Donald Trump’s declaration that “Paris is out of control, so dangerous’, during his presidential campaign. In 2016 alone, 36,5 million tourists came to Greater Paris, and in the first half of 2017 hotels there received no less than 16 million guests, according to the Paris Visitors Bureau. That is a lot of people! What it means is, if you want to go to any of the major attractions — the Eiffel Tower, the Champs Elysees Avenue, the Louvre Museum or the Marais neighborhood, to name a few — you better be prepared to face crowds of people from every corner of the world: all looks, languages and ages are represented in the streets of Paris. To actually enjoy some of those attractions, you may have to fight your way in.
This is all fresh in my mind. I just came back from Paris after 10 days in the Marais, the charming old part of town that is all the rage now. October is not a particularly high time for tourism — not summer vacation (good luck then!), not a holiday, not the (in)famous Fashion Week, no Christmas or religious holiday, either. Yet, all over the city nervous tour guides holding signs up high, to keep their groups together, disputed with the residents the narrow sidewalks. Crowded? You bet!
And there are newcomers to this scene: the Chinese. Until recently not allowed by their communist government to travel abroad, they are sure making up for it — in 2016 alone, 881.000 Chinese visited the city, and the number keeps growing, again according the Paris Visitors Bureau. Stores are full of them, museums, restaurants, cafes, sidewalks. Never alone, but in groups of 12 or 15 people, they love luxury shopping and buy everything they can, taking many pictures, curious and excited, and clearly enjoying themselves a great deal.
Paris is not only great things, of course. On a sad note, this time I also saw refugees from Syria and other Middle East countries, a problem all of Europe is facing these days, one with no clear solution in sight. Some sleep on the streets, some build shelters wherever they can, a clear challenge to the government of newly inaugurated president Emmanuel Macron. Another concern is the pickpockets in the subway, usually young gypsies who also sing and play instruments in the cars. Once on a ride, I heard a Frenchman near me yell at a kid begging for money: “you should be in school at this hour”. Everyone around seemed to agree.
But even with problems Paris is still amazing — and fun and beautiful, and worth every penny I spend to visit it whenever I can. No other place I know — and I’ve been to many — takes my breath away the way this city does, with its beauty and grace, glamour and class. No matter how many times I see it, it always surprises me.
But this last visit convinced me to be careful with my dates, next time. I will for sure avoid school vacation — July and August — when Parisians travel with their kids but parents from the rest of the world bring theirs. I will stay away from Fashion Week, which in 2018 will happen on Feb 27th — March 6th, when designers from all over come to look for “inspiration”, booking all hotels in the city and causing price surges everywhere.
Come to think of it, I may choose to travel in cold January, when the streets are not crowded and the lines smaller at the museums, something I did once and enjoyed immensely. It’s easy to check the city’s calendar in advance: there is a site in English for that: https://en.parisinfo.com/. I don’t work for them, by the way, but find it very useful and easy to navigate.
No matter what time of year I choose to go, my love affair with Paris will never die, though. In one of my favorite movie scenes ever, the iconic last scene of the movie Casablanca, Rick said to Ilsa: “we’ll always have Paris”.
I thank God for it, and I will keep going back, bien sur.

A “journal” of our year long trip away from Vancouver.

“…Is to know a great deal.” ~ Henry Miller (controversial author)
Paris is a place of lore. After years of listening to people I love and respect talk endlessly about Paris, we had arrived. Albeit, only for a long weekend. It wasn’t enough time.
It’s not only clients or friends. Paris has been revered throughout history as an artist’s haven.
“An artist has no home in Europe except in Paris.” ~ Friedrich Nietzsche
A divine place of historical significance, beauty and culture.
“A walk about Paris will provide lessons in history, beauty, and in the point of Life.” ~ Thomas Jefferson
And of course, surrealism and the années folles or the golden twenties. The birth of pop culture. The modern development of fashion and style. A melting pot of American influence, tremendous economic growth, film, theatre, and athletics.
Many of my favourite writers and artists have lived in Paris at some point in their career.
“Paris was always worth it and you received return for whatever you brought to it.” ~ Ernest Hemingway
For the novice traveller, Paris comes with quite the résumé.
Dare I say it is the the most over-hyped city I’ve ever travelled to. My feelings are more mixed than history’s. Possibly due to over-saturation and cost of living. Which is saying a lot coming from Vancouver (another high cost of living city). Then again, it could be because I don’t have any Parisian friends to show me around.
It’s the 3rd most visited city in the world, but the average dollar amount spent by tourists is double the top two cities (Bangkok/London). $301/day USD compared to $153–173.
It’s extremely expensive, and shockingly packed with tourist destinations.
You can’t walk more than a few hundred meters without tripping over the next museum or historical landmark. Seriously I can throw a rock from the Louvre to Saint Chapelle.
We saw the outside of pretty much everything on day one. Then we were left wishing we had planned some skip the line excursions. Getting ready to leave and Oktoberfest were so busy we forgot to plan things that weren’t accommodation. Even in October, it was crowded with tourists!
Yes, I understand the irony of that statement, being that I’m a tourist. No matter how I may like to pretend I’m not, or try to experience places as locals do. I remain an ignorant tourist.
I can only wonder how @#%@ing crazy Paris is in the summertime.
Paris, has a population of ~2.3 million. The majority of the city is composed of five story walk-ups. Making it the most densely populated metropolis in a developed country and it’s geographically tiny!
Vancouver is tiny, at only 115 km². We build towers exceeding thirty stories and have a population of only 600k. San Francisco, another tiny city, is 121 km² and 800k people. I’m amazed by the density of Paris without the need for many tall buildings.
Paris is a mere 105 km² with triple or quadruple the people. That means it’s chaotic. Very walkable, with an somewhat outdated and packed metro system. At least it covers a great deal of the city and they post hilarious signs in it.
And my personal Fav…
Are misunderstood. I had full on expectations of being forced to stumble through my poor French. While the person I’m attempting to communicate with snickers behind my back about it.
You hear stories. Few of them true.
The service doesn’t suck, it’s just not Americanized. It’s supposed to be felt and not seen. They are not coming to check on you every 5 minutes. They are not coming by to crack jokes and entertain you for tips. They want you to enjoy your meal or coffee or whatever. When you’re done, ask for the cheque s’il vous plaît and you’re off.
I kind of like it. I’m not fond of being waited on.
People are not rude. But you should keep an eye on your stuff and your wallet when travelling on packed transit. As you should in any major city.
People are fashionable. I should have brought a scarf. A concern Jenny and I both have about travelling to Europe, is only obvious in Paris so far. Not that I’m fashionable to begin with. I have for the better part of twelve years worked in shorts, a sweat-wicking shirt and maybe a track suit of sorts.
There is a pervasive feeling in any country about the largest city. Canadians outside of Toronto like to hate on it. The French outside of Paris also seem to hate on Paris. I get the feeling Parisians are in love with their city.
There is an air of smugness. I feel the same way about Vancouver. The French tend to think that Parisians never shut up about Paris when they leave it. Everything is better in Paris! I don’t feel this way about Toronto but I know some who do.
I’m choked I missed the Catacombs. Things were so crazy before we left and at Oktoberfest we forgot to book any tours.
The only non-negotiable thing for me was the Louvre. I’ve had a fascination with Leonardo Da Vinci since I was a kid and seeing the Mona Lisa was a top priority.
It’s true that no matter where you stand in the room, it feels like she’s staring just at you. A special technique Da Vinci used. Of course the world’s most famous painting is so famous due to the mystery surrounding it.
There are many other famous works in the Louvre like Venus De Milo, Winged Victory, The Coronation of Napoleon, Dying Slave and Liberty Leading Leading the People. Michelangelo. Delacroix. Who cares? I’m all about Da Vinci right now. 😜
We crushed a few kilometers of walking every day. I thoroughly enjoyed taking it all in. You could have a great weekend without going into a single tourist venue.
We stayed near the Eiffel tower. Had a bottle of wine on the grass during one of the hourly light shows. Roamed through a beautiful market. Rolled down Champs-Élysées past the Arc de Triomphe and the Louvre.
I know French food is amazing but we cooked in our tiny AirBnB more often than not. Who can resist French cheese and charcuterie?
After a costly Oktoberfest, we’re attempting to be a little more budget conscious here. It seems more likely we’ll be back to Paris than Munich anyway.
I’m just going to say it. If you like red wine, it’s the best in France. End of story. I’m convinced they don’t ship any of the good stuff to Canada.
Oh and don’t forget about the street art and a surprising coincidence. An Alphonse Mucha exhibit was on when we were there! One of the few pieces of art we own is a print of Zodiac. I’m a much bigger Mucha fan leaving Paris.
That’s our world-wind tour of Paris. It isn’t my favourite city yet but I can see the charm and appeal. We’ll be back for the catacombs.
It was the weekend so neither of us worked which was nice, Bordeaux will be different. Back to work...🤘

So you’ve landed in Paris with your family and your cats. What now?
It turns out that when you land in another country halfway around the world where you’ve never lived and don’t speak the language, things can be a little confusing. We were especially ill-prepared, not having been to Paris before for more than a few days at a time and neither of us speaking more than a couple of words of French. When we landed, we had the address of our rental apartment and a few bags and that was about it. We’ve learned a few things since then that may be useful to anyone following in our footsteps.
Here is a survivor’s guide to the first 30 days on the ground in Paris.
If you’re from the United States, it’s likely this is going to be the most confusing thing for you when you land and try to get a life together here. There are two major differences between bank accounts in Europe and in America — the “chip and pin” card and the RIB.
Let’s start with the “chip and pin” card. You know that credit or debit card that you have in your wallet? Well, it’s useless in about 20% of the places you’re going to try to spend money here. In another 30%, while it will technically work, it’s extremely confusing to the people trying to take it. You see, in Europe, they have “smart card” credit and debit cards. They have a little smart chip in them (a little goldish squarish technical looking chip on the left side of the card) and a pin code.
Everywhere you go, instead of swiping your card, you stick the card into a reader and type in your pin. Restaurants never physically take your card away, they bring a reader to your table and you insert your card, type in the pin and take the card back out. I don’t think I’ve had a single French person touch any of my credit cards once since landing here. The way Americans handle credit cards is comically insecure to the entire European continent.
I had a fun issue with this almost immediately after getting here. We landed in Paris on Monday morning. On Thursday evening, just a few days after touching down, I attended a meetup that GitHub was sponsoring by buying pizza, soda and beer. A few hours before starting, the organizer let me know that I would have to personally pay for the food on site. Normally this isn’t how it works, normally they would pay for it and GitHub would reimburse them, but these details weren’t worked out beforehand.
I knew this was potentially going to be a problem, because I’ve been to Europe before and I know about the chip cards and besides that I only had an Amex corporate card which not everyone takes. I figured I would probably have to put this on a personal card at best. Well, it turned out that they delivered €993.14 worth of food and low and behold, they only take chip cards. So I had to embarrassingly find someone there who could float $1300 personally and PayPal them the money. This was also done almost entirely in French. Good times.
This is just the worst situation I’ve encountered. Tons of places simply won’t take non-chip cards. The most frustrating is the Metro system — if you don’t have a chip card or cash, no trains or public transportation for you.
The next major difference between the US and French banking systems is the RIB. “RIB” stands for Relevé d’Identité Bancaire and is one of a few bank account numbers that are needed for bank transfers (basically a wire). For ongoing monthly payments, credit cards seem to be almost never used here. Instead, you give people your RIB sheet (like a weird little bank form that you print from your bank website) and they do bank transfers every month with these numbers.
It’s actually sort of an awesome system because you can look up individual people you’re paying this way and shut them down individually if you want to stop paying. With a credit card you would have to cancel the card in a scorched-earth sort of move to stop someone from charging who didn’t want to.
It’s important because there are a lot of important things that you cannot pay for without this form, which you cannot get without a French bank account. Some things we ran into fairly quickly were rent for the apartment, real SIM cards, co-working space rent, and gym memberships. Our utility costs happen to be either included or passed onto us by the landlord, otherwise I assume those would require a RIB too.
So, for the love of God, start getting a bank account the second you hit dry land. I tried getting an account before we got here, but essentially got nowhere with it. Everyone told me to just come in when I arrived in France.
About a week after landing, I finally got it together to email a bank. I contacted Crédit Agricole d’Ile-de-France through an English version online form on their website. I can highly recommend them. They contacted me back almost immediately after filling out the form (June 18th, while I was still in the US) and I got back to them 2.5 months later (Sep 1st, after we moved in) and they immediately helped me through everything.
You will have to bring:
Passport
A utility bill from your home address less than 3 months old (electricity, water)
Proof of income (payslip or Tax statement)
Your last 2 months bank statements from your main account
Now, since we just moved in and didn’t have a utility bill in our name, we instead had to bring in a utility bill in our landlord’s name, plus a copy of their passport and a letter saying we live at their address. Luckily our landlord had done this before and got us all the documents we needed within a few days. The other documents we already had copies of from our visa application process months earlier.
The guy that helped us, Kristopher, was a super English gentleman and could not have been kinder or more helpful. We had to go in person to their office which was over in the 12th district, but it wasn’t too bad. The process took about 45 minutes in a private office with Kristopher and we had the RIB that day and I went to pick up the chip cards from the same office a few days later. Then we went to a local branch, took out about $400 from our Chase account and deposited it into our new CA account to get it going.
My only real advice here would be to do this something like the day after you land rather than a week or two later. Actually, it’s best to do whenever you can get the residency documents from your landlord — maybe even let them know you’ll need these before you arrive so you could get this done on the first day.
Finally, I should cover how to get money into your account. You can certainly wire funds, which costs about $20 per wire I believe. Unfortunately for us, we hit a bit of a race condition here. We had already switched our phones to French pre-paid SIM cards (more on that in a bit), but we couldn’t add a wire recipient without SMS confirmation. I suppose we could have called them, but I really hate talking on the phone to banks so I sort of avoided it. It’s on my list of things to do.
What I’ve been doing in the meantime is using PayPal. I set up a new PayPal account linked to my French account and I send money from the American account to the French account and then deposit it. It doesn’t seem like a horrible exchange rate and if you fund it via the linked bank accounts the fees aren’t bad at all. It takes a few days, but it works. Also, be warned that if you try to send more than €2,500 you will get flagged and need to upload pictures of your passport and whatnot to PayPal so they know you’re not laundering money. I’ve actually hit a lot of really annoying things lately due to people wanting to make sure I’m not laundering money.
If you’re smarter than I am and still have your old SIM and can add your new French account as a wire recipient on your US bank account, I’ve been directed by my European friends to a site called TransferWise. They apparently have great rates for international bank transfers like this. One of my next goals is to get this working for me so I don’t have to keep doing this PayPal hack.
We’re going to be here for a while, so we definitely needed local phone plans. Not having data on your phone while trying to navigate around and find places gets frustrating really quickly. Using your American phone account to do so get expensive really quickly.
One of the very first things we did the day after we landed was walk over to an Orange shop and buy prepaid SIM cards. For those of you who are American and have no idea what a SIM card is, it’s a tiny little card that goes into the side of your phone that changes it’s carrier and phone number. Most Americans never change these but it’s fairly common in Europe to have a few of them and swap them out when you visit other countries — like have a German SIM and a UK SIM, etc.
You can pay about €5 for the card and €30 to fill it with a plan that lasts a few weeks and gives you 1Gb of data during that time. It takes a few minutes of waiting in line (I think it’s illegal to not wait for at least 20 minutes after entering a mobile phone shop here), but then you leave with a working phone. Many Americans may also not know if their phone is unlocked, meaning the phone allows you to change the SIM out at all. Most iPhones sold in the last few years have come unlocked, but you can also call your carrier and ask them to do so for you.
That lasted us for a week or two, though you need to be careful what you do with it. If you accidentally make an international call you can exhaust the credit really quickly and then you lose your data too. After a really long time I finally figured out how to recharge it. You can go to recharge.fr, click on the Orange carrier, choose the €5 or €10 plan, pay with PayPal and then text the confirmation number they give you (a 14 digit number) to 21224.
Jessica’s phone kept draining super quickly for some reason that we couldn’t figure out. For a while I had to recharge it almost every day, it was super annoying. My HTC One M8 only had to be recharged every week or so.
Eventually we wanted to get real SIM cards with plans. For one, the prepaid cards don’t let you connect to 4G, so the data is slower than it could be. For another, you don’t have a card on file with them so you can’t recharge very easily. It’s also almost impossible to figure out why you’re running out of credit. There are packages for €40/mo that give you 7Gb of data per month and 4G access. The catch is you need a RIB and proof of residency. Once we had our bank account, we went back into the Orange store and signed up for a year contract to get the better SIMs. Remember to make copies of the residency documents you took to the bank, because you’ll need them again here.
When you get here, it’s going to be tempting to Amazon things that you need to yourself, but the issue is that there are very few apartments where they can drop stuff off for you. Unless you’re home all the time, they’ll show up to your place and then drop off the package at a point relais or “relay point”. This could be a grocery store or a pharmacy or a laundromat. If you’re lucky, this will be a point that’s close to home. We ordered a couple of household items that we couldn’t find around town our first week and had 4 packages delivered to 4 different places, some of them a mile away. Not only do you have to go get them, but then you have to haul them back to your place. If you order something heavy, it’s up to you to walk it back to your place.
Also nobody that handles these relay points speaks English because why would a non-Frenchman be sending packages to themselves via relay points? This is not a super-touristy thing to do. The first one I did was pretty painful, I had no idea how to say why I was there and I didn’t have a drop slip with me that they usually leave in your mailbox. The important word here is “colis”, which is what they call this type of package. Just mutter something like “j’ai un colis ici” and hand them the slip and your passport and they can generally figure it out. If you don’t hand them your passport the first thing they’ll ask you is a phrase containing the word “identification” (say that in your head in a French accent) — this is a good word to learn how to listen for because it comes up a lot and it’s easy to continue making them think you know what they’re saying by handing them your passport.
I found out later that Amazon.fr will let you specifically chose a relay point when you check out. This ends up being a way better idea because you can choose one much closer to your place and you can get to know the process there a little better. You can also log into Amazon.fr (which is a totally separate site) with your normal Amazon.com account and pay for things in USD instead of taking the currency conversion hit, which is also nice. This can be really helpful for getting things together in the first few weeks.
The metro in Paris is fantastic. If you’re living in San Francisco, it’s almost hilarious how much better public transportation in Paris is compared to the city with the world’s worst public transportation system outside of LA.
The trains go everywhere, it’s simple and cheap to get tickets and the trains come basically every 2 minutes. I think the longest I’ve waited for a train in the month I’ve been here is probably 6 minutes and I’ve taken them pretty much every day. There are at least 4 major metro stops within a few blocks of our house.
We donated our car to KQED when we left San Francisco, and it’s been pretty amazing to have not needed a car at all in over a month. If we do need a car, Uber is also operating in San Francisco, and the accounts we already used still work fine. You can launch the app and get a car within a few minutes. Not only that, but since you can now put a destination in it helps with the language barrier in trying to inform your driver of where you’re going if they only speak French.
If you are in Paris for any amount of time over a week, you should definitely get a Navigo card. This is another thing that took me a bit of time to figure out. Paris has a RFID card that you can load up with credit and use to get onto the metro without having to buy tickets. You can load it up with either a week or a month, I believe. It’s actually a little confusing when you first get here because they have these recharge stations that don’t dispense tickets but can only recharge these Navigo cards, but they don’t dispense the Navigo cards themselves. In Tokyo, for example, you can get a card like this from a machine in the subway station (good ol’ Pasmo), but here you cannot.
To get a real Navigo card, you have to be a resident. However, I think fairly recently, they added a Découverte card, which you can just buy as a visitor. I believe you can get these at the manned booths at the train station, but those guys always seem a little pissed, so instead I went to a tobacco shop. You can find these shops every few blocks around Paris. They usually have a “tabac” sign and an RATP sign that’s fairly easy to identify. If you see one, just duck in and say anything resembling the word “Navigo” and they’ll know what you mean. I think it costs €5 for the card and you can normally charge it there with either one week or one month of use. I got cards for all three of us and it’s way easier than buying a hundred of the little one-way tickets. If you’re in Paris for even a week and are going to be using the Metro a lot, pick up one of these cards.
They also have this weird thing in Paris where any membership cards you get they want you to put your picture on. They don’t do it themselves, they give you a card with a sticky area on it and expect you to go to a photo booth, print out a picture and affix it yourself. The Navigo cards are like this and a year membership to the science museums we got for Jo was like this too. They have these booths in a number of the Metro stations and they also have one at the FNAC, the sort of Best Buy of Paris.
It’s important to understand that there isn’t really a thing here like American breakfast. It’s called “petit déjeuner” but it’s really just like a coffee and a croissant.
Just learn to not expect eggs and bacon and pancakes first thing in the morning because it’s almost certainly not going to happen unless you go to a toursity place that has “American” breakfast.
Basically the most important thing to learn here is to say “café crème” (kuh-fay khremm) which is basically a small latte. They are delicious and sitting at a table on the street watching people go by slowly sipping a latte is something that simply doesn’t get old.
That’s all of the weird “getting set up” logistical stuff I can think of that we went through that might save you some grief if you ever do something like this too.
Having been here for a month now, it’s incredibly satisfying to feel a little more like a native by whipping out my chip card to pay for groceries or Navigo to walk through the subway turnsiles with Josie. Even just walking around with visitors and using my data plan or being able to give out a local number to people I meet here so they can text me is really nice.
We’re really starting to feel at home, even in daily life.

Trying to get at those travel stories about the verve and the swerve. Not your typical source for travel advice. These are stories about how travel changes you and unfolds you, not how best to be pampered and coddled.

Our interest in travel has something to do with our need to find the swerve. The led-by-the-nose tours suit some but not us. We set out to build adversity and surprise into our personal all-inclusive package. We want to be able to remind ourselves that things like sitting between train cars as a result of thinking it was a good idea to save nine Euros on unassigned seats is nothing more than a gift from heaven to enhance our lives.
The hitches and unforeseen hesitations are the swerves that create the pulse of travel.
This was our plan as we set off to grab a slice of Northern Europe. I have never been to this part of the world and neither has my wife. It was a gap in our travels that we needed to fill. And it was the draw of meeting friends in Paris and Switzerland and the Netherlands that set the outlines for our itinerary.
Our overnight flight left me wide awake with excitement while Stefanie was able to snooze a bit. The route to Paris ran first to Frankfort with its awkward funnel through customs that a weary business traveler commiserated with us on, “The worst!” he said. No ranks of Uzi toting police at the airport as I was led to believe. Then on a jump flight to Charles De Gualle arriving in Paris in the early morning.
We got help with our transit connection from a group of young travelers who like us were trying to find the best and cheapest mode to city center. The bus into town seemed promising but more expensive then the Metro so we found our way to the train station and rode into Paris.
The outskirts were unimpressive. But when we popped out of the subway tunnel into city center we emerged onto that glorious limestone and Mansard roofed landscape of Paris I’ve known from pictures and film. Cafes seemingly every three storefronts, busy Parisians hustling off to work, we spilled onto these streets with our luggage in tow and tried to get our bearings.
Promises of easy access to free wi-fi went unfulfilled (as they would continue to be) so we asked the kind shop steward for directions to Petite de Champs, the address of our lodgings. He pointed us off on a tramp of about ten blocks which we accomplished and proceeded to turn down the street that had Petite de Champs in the name. We found the address over a door that was supposed to be green but wasn’t. Door locked. Asked at the cafe if we could borrow his phone to call the lady and she described her place in variance to what we were seeing. We should have known something was up.
She said the key was upstairs under the mat. Since we couldn’t get in the street door the cafe guy somehow produced a key and let us in. We lugged our travel belongings up four flights and upon winded arrival found no key under the mat as promised. We collapsed in the hall and a dog bark inside one of the flats brought a young lady to the door. Yes, address and apartment number were correct, no she didn’t know our host’s name. This is truly weird. We were clearly missing a piece to this puzzle.
Back we go down to the cafe to discover through a second call and the cafe man’s astute observation that there were TWO Rue Petite de Champs. This one was Rue Croix Petite de Champs (“the road that crosses” our Petite de Champs). So off we march to find the correct Rue and the aforementioned green door and all the details familiar to our host’s descriptions. Our first swerve.
To get to our real Paris abode we climbed another four flights of well worn stair treads to the sound of our screaming calf muscles and behold, find the key under the mat! Our room was tidy and totally sufficient to our needs. We managed to contact our friends who had been if France now touring alredy for a week and made a plan to meet that afternoon. After a long travel day with swerves large and small we settled in for a snooze.
That didn’t last long because we were in Paris and the city was waiting just out there! Off we went to find our friend’s lodgings which were in the same area of Paris, the First Arrondissement north of the Seine. We mapped out the walk to get there but to no avail, missing a turn and requiring further instructions from yet another in our chain of kind shop owners who served us so faithfully. Turning down Rue de Hyacinth we were greeted by our friend’s “Bonjoir” from his second floor balcony. We reunited with our good friends Wolf and Charlotte from San Miguel de Allende and Charlotte’s son Ethan. Sat in their salon (this is Paris after all) to catch up and make our plans for the next few days.
We launched off for an afternoon walk through the gorgeous and immense Louvre courtyards where a cellist was busking under an arch that led towards the pyramid.
Great acoustics there that did his talents proud. We lingered a while to listen and became acquainted with the magic that is The City of Lights. Then down to the Seine to see Notre Dame in one direction and Musee d’Orsay in the other. Our original lodging was to be on a barge in the Seine in front of the Musee but our host there had to cancel due to some hitch with periodic maintenance. Sadly, it was not to be for us but we had moved on. Walking back through the Louvre courtyard back into our neighborhood we found our dinner restaurant. I had duck confit which was fittingly outstanding. The waiter helped me learn to say “I don’t speak French” so I could beg off as needed. I was using “no parlez vous” which accused the person opposite me of not speaking the language. I was also working hard on my “Ravi de vous rencontrer” (“nice to meet you”) which served as my only accomplishment of a multi-word French phrase during our stay in France.
The next day Stefanie and I went back to the Louvre, this time actually going inside. We entered through the pyramid and sat down to map out our visit since this most enormous of art museums requires a strategy to trim the seemingly infinite possibilities. We headed first to the French and Italian painting of the 16th and 17th centuries. We were both stopped dead in our tracks in front of the Holbein portraits. Soft and pulsating flesh that has actual blood flowing through it as best I can tell. Firm and telling hands. Eyes that beg conversation. These people emerge from the years as fully alive and unburdened by any mists of obscurity history presents.
We found an amazing veiled bust of a woman in the Egyptian wing that stood our neck hairs on end. She had all the mystery of the ages wrapped in her half hidden face and could easily have been mistaken for the work of a modern master.
Rooms and rooms of paintings. On through early Renaissance Italian works where Stefanie called me back to pause because I had rushed by a bit. She was right as usual. These were delicate and everyday human renditions that broke from the religious/aristocratic subject matter.
Then rooms and rooms of furniture for the era of the the King Louis’. Seemingly endless collections of amazing craftsmanship but largely vacant of people who, including me, find the style overbearing and fusty. All that effort by expert furniture makers who I’m sure thought their efforts were proffered in a style that represented the pinnacle of everlasting beauty.
Finally, and more by chance than design we crossed by the famous “Winged Victory” to the more populated wing where the icon of all things art resides. “The Cult of the Mona” was in full throng and the packed room focused their cameras on the tiny, charming, sedate portrait that causes people with only a nodding familiarity with art to change their life’s course in order to view. The painting looks just like the reproductions and is just about poster sized as well. Nice but I wasn’t exactly moved to tears by the encounter.
“The Cult of the Mona” throng who were taking pictures, on the other hand, were more interesting to me. The cultural anthropologist in me was interested in expanding on the theory of large groups as they relate to cultural icons. I also wondered how time will operate on this painting. Will we ever actually get over it? Is there life outside the cult? In my picture of the swooning multitudes I counted three who where actually looking with their own eyes at that particular moment.
The next room is where I found my true joy. Against a side wall in a room full of absolute masterpieces was the monumental “Raft of the Medusa” by Theodore Gericault. Depicting the crisis moment after an apparent shipwreck in tossed seas (based on an actual shipwreck with tragic loss of life), the painting presents the survivors huddling and comforting each other while the more intact denizens of this piece of flotsam raise a red cloth to signal a far distant ship. An image of human struggle to maintain hope in the face of nature’s imposition of mortality.
We headed to our rendezvous (Paris thing again…) with our friends in front of Notre Dame Cathedral. We were late but they were later. Our plan was to walk into Sain Germaine across the Seine and time was getting way from us. That and the long line into Notre Dame led us away to cross the river leaving the famous Cathedral for our next visit to Paris.
The West Bank of the Seine is where we came upon the well known green boothed book sellers called “bouguinistes”. We strolled the Seine’s bank and examined the wonderful contents of each booth. Some had the uninteresting plastic tourists mementos but most had great old posters, postcards and photographs tracing the history of Paris. Several vendors were selling truly beautiful etchings and lithographs, many with cityscape and landscape subjects from the past centuries.
We turned back to review the stands once more because our target was the famous Shakespeare Booksellers shop. This landmark of Paris was owned by the person who first published James Joyce’s “Ulysses” and did it while others were still scratching their heads over it. Tight little aisles and racks of books new and old. And full of my favorite variety of human beings; those who read actual books!
Upstairs were small nooks and rooms like comfortable pockets with chairs stuffed right for a relaxed afternoon read. Quiet people with heads pointed towards some tome of literate fantasy or other account of the human project.
Outside we sat on a bench for a little refreshment and it turns out our choice was a famous place of repose. A group of tourists wanted to sit and have their pictures taken there. I obliged, by getting up and saying “What, did Hemingway sit here?” which seemed to amuse them. I’ll have to dig into the bench’s provenance.
We then walked into the neighborhood of Paris that took the prize from us both: Sain Germaine. Here is the true pulse of Paris; in the voices from the cafes and in the silence from old churches, in the beat of the people strolling at ease in the slanting rays of the sun, in the rhythm of five and six story grey limestone edifices capped with the Mansard roofs rising up to shout “Paris!”. I did not want this episode of our travel to end. The pulse had become my own.

It’s been a few days since I landed in Paris. I tried to write the first night, but I got about a paragraph and a half completed and had to stop because I was tired. Here’s what I wrote:
“It’s 7:28 pm in Paris and it’s been an interesting first day. The flight landed at around 1 pm and I partially slept on the flight. Enough that I didn’t feel that bad and that’s a pretty good way to start.”
Just a few minutes later, we went out on our first exploration of the area to walk along the canal St. Martin and happened to come across a restaurant we ate at last summer, Le Verre Volé. It was excellent and then we popped into a neighborhood wine shop and tried two glasses of wine that were excellent and with varietals I’ve never heard of before. It was a wonderful first day.
Our second day in Paris started out by sleeping in. I didn’t sleep well that first night and was up at 3 am not able to sleep. Then, we slept in and didn’t get out until 3 pm. The next day consisted of running some errands: eating at a now favorite boulangerie, Du Pain et des idées, (Considered one of the best in town), getting a new French phone number, going to the Alliance Française to check out the process of the placement test, then walking through the most beautiful garden on the planet, Le Jardin du Luxumbourg, and then deciding to head over to the Louvre, because it’s open until 10 pm on Wednesdays and we wanted to see if we could purchase our yearly pass, Les Amis Du Louvre. We were able to purchase our passes and decided to see just one thing…. Marcelo gave me the choice and because he mentioned Napolean III’s chambers, which I had never seen, we went there. I think the Louve is best experienced in small doses because it’s so so big and there’s so much to see. I was actually considering blogging about going to every room in the Louvre over the next year, since it’s something that I really want to see and experience.
After walking through Napolean’s palace chambers, we found a high rated wine bar with charcuterie in the Marais which was on the way back to our airbnb that looked good. We meandered there walking through areas we’d never seen and just as we came upon the Pompidou, we turned left and had an incredible platter of rillette, two types of fromage (cheese), and jamon iberico and another type of ham. SO good.
We literally walked outside after it was over, to see a bustlingly busy bar, or street, rather, since half the patrons were outside smoking, and thought, “Oh, this looks like a cool bar!” and started walking in only to find my one friend in Paris, there with a group of his other friends. This is a feeling I haven’t had in a long time. Walking around a place and randomly running into someone I knew. Capitol Hill in Seattle used to be like this for me.
Today, Day 3, we woke up and I had a coffee down the street at a Portuguese cafe with real Pastel de Nata (which were excellent), then we met our official translator of our Marriage Certificate to pick up our French translation to later include in my equivalent of a green card application. Then we get more pastries from aforementioned new favorite pastry shop and I went to the Alliance Francaise to register and take my placement test. We spent the evening at home, eating incredible organic cheese from the “Biologique” market a block away and drinking a ridiculously good cider for 3€.
Now that I’ve had some more time to think and process, I’ve come up with some things that have surprised me, awed me with their beauty, stunned me with their simplicity, and with their cost.
Easier than Expected
There were some potential hurdles that I was worried about that turned out not to be hurdles: checkin for the flight in Seattle, immigration and customs in France, and getting a phone. I was worried that a one-way ticket would sound off the alarms and that we would be detained by immigration. We even printed out the EU regulations in English and in French just in case a customs officer didn’t want to let me in the country. But, alas, they were not needed. I checked into my flight and went through immigration and customs very quickly.
Getting a phone number was also much easier than I anticipated. My husband is an Italian citizen, so he just showed his passport, and they started signing us up for our new phones. Oh, and it was also a lot less expensive than we expected. We got a phone number for 9€ each and then a monthly payment of 30€ which has unlimited calling in France and free roaming in Europe. We got prepaid phones for the first few months so that after we get our apartment, we can switch over to a package that includes internet.
I have been reading a book on Culture Shock in France and read that one shouldn’t smile too much and that Americans smile and French people find it unsettling. The woman who helped us with our phones was very kind and chatty and smiled a lot.
Misconceptions about the French
Everyone (aside from one, which I’ll talk about later), has been incredibly kind and helpful. We’ve had good service, helpful, smiling people in shops, and very patient people willing to help us out. Honestly, I’ve had an extremely positive experience here in France every time I’ve been here and running into one person having a bad day doesn’t mean that every French person is rude.
Ok, the one rude person was the checker at the nearby supermarket. I waited in line for my turn and when it was my turn, I put the shopping back on the counter so he could check my items. Apparently, I was supposed to take them out of the basket, because in a huff, he dumped the basket over, toppling out all the items and then glared at me. I didn’t laugh, but I thought about how it must be a stressful time of day since the line was long and he was the only person there. Eh. Whatever. I know now to take them out when I see him. I tested out this theory getting some groceries tonight and the woman at the other market was super nice and just stared checking the items out of the basket before I could take them out. Ok, it was just that guy.
The French don’t speak English. Wrong. We literally have to continue speaking in French to people once they realize we aren’t native speakers or we are a little slow. Marcelo is MUCH better than I am at French (speaking both Portuguese and Italian, the roots of the words are very similar) and he told me this would happen. Just keep speaking in French, even if they respond in English. I’ve been tripped up a few times, but most of the time, I can follow what’s going on, even if I can’t say exactly what I want to say. So yeah, everyone has been incredibly helpful and speaks English pretty well.
Some fun cultural differences
You bag your own groceries and you always pay extra if you need a bag. Everyone carries around reusable bags to use for groceries. I still need to get one of those (I know I have one at home, but sadly, didn’t bring any with me).
Get used to waiting longer than you think. Another fun cultural difference was having at the wine and charcuterie last night. When we got to the wine bar, the one guy who was working said we could sit wherever we wanted and that he’d be right there to check on us. He gave us menus, and off we went. There were two tables available (and we had a reservation, so it was nice that we had a choice). One was cramped in between other tables and the other had more room around it, but it had dirty plates from the previous guests. We sat at the nicer table with more room, but with the dirty dishes. Surely, he’ll be by soon to pick them up…
…
After about 10–15 min, we are questioning what was going on. We look over and realize he is the only person there and that he is preparing all the food for everyone. Ok, makes sense. It’s a small place, but he’s busy. We discuss whether it’s culturally appropriate to give him the dirty plates. We could smell some of the paté from the previous plate and well, we kinda wanted to not smell it. Marcelo thought that would be considered rude (I think generally American Type A-ness is considered rude in France), so we opted to move them to the other, sill vacant table. Marcelo took them over and then came back a mix of shocked and horrified and said that everyone in the restaurant turned to look at what he was doing. Apparently, you’re not supposed to bus a dirty table, or move them to another table.
Around 25 min after we arrived, we still hadn’t ordered. The waiter came by to say, “Just a minute,” and “We ran out of bread so I have to go get some next door.” And then ran out of the restaurant, had a smoke break while he was chatting up the cute girl up front, then came back several minutes later to cut the bread and brought it out to the other tables.
Then, he took our order. We didn’t know how the menu worked, so we had to ask a few questions and he then had to bring another menu and we waited again for him to come back… after we ordered, he put together the plate and well, the photo says it all. It was shockingly good. The rillette alone was amazing, the wine was perfect, we both had a different favorite cheese and there was a moment half way through the meal that I realized that the Jamon Iberico was most likely literally from Spain. It was excellent. And my Spanish friends out there will be proud to know that the Jamon truly represented Spain well. Love.
Nothing goes to waste. Oh yeah, I forgot the other thing about the bread. After the other table left, he picked up their bread basket and put it on our table, next to the fresh basket of bread that he brought us. Marcelo pointed out, “You’d never see that happen in the US!” True that. Nope, but I didn’t mind. I’m glad it wasn’t thrown out. It would have totally been a huge waste because the bread was so good. I think Marcelo said it best when he said, “This meal couldn’t be eaten without bread.”
Eggs are kept outside the fridge. Really? Yeah, really. We looked this up last week because I didn’t believe Marcelo when he said Europeans don’t refrigerate their eggs. We found this short video that explains why. But yes, it’s true:
Wine is crazy inexpensive… and excellent. It was hard to find bottles over 8€ in the store. Tonight, we had a crazy inexpensive cider for 3€. We splurged to get a Morgon, (A particularly amazing Beaujolais) for about a quarter of what it would be in Seattle.
I have so much more to write about and so much more to say, but I’ll leave it here for now. For those following my instagram, you’ve seen more, and I promise some of that will make it into this blog too. Some of it won’t. Like how we happened to come across a game store, only to find it’s solely a Warhammer store. They kindly invited us to do a quick demo of the game and miniture painting and also directed us to another nearby board game store that sells the games we’re used to. I didn’t take a photo, but I was impressed. Games were similarly priced, or less expensive, than in the US. I seriously thought everything would be expensive, but no, life is not only much better here, it’s also less expensive.

What you have to do to prepare to move from San Francisco to Paris in three months.
So, you’ve decided to move from the United States to Paris, France.
Perhaps like myself you made this decision more or less on a whim with no real planning going into it before the decision was made, or perhaps you took a longer, more reasonable approach to the problem. Either way, you now have a series of things to do before you board that airplane.
Now, I should preface this by saying that I’m not a lawyer and I’m not a travel agency. I did find it useful, however, when I was planning my move to read through the notes of other people who had done roughly the same thing. There are only a handful of them on the internet (here are some) and if you’re seriously considering doing this, read them all in addition to this. Your mileage is certain to vary.
What is amazing about this process is that most of it is dictated by government agencies, and yet nearly every step of the process is insanely vague. Therefore, I feel that sharing what we experienced could be hugely helpful to someone else trying to accomplish the same thing. Reading through the consulate docs are one thing, hearing the story of what real people went through is a bit different. Again, this is not a how-to, this is a how-we-did-done.
Well, first things first, getting a French visa. In order to live in France for longer than the normal 3 months a tourist visa gets you, one has to get a long stay visa of some kind. There are several different types of long stay visas you can get, though most are super specific — being a student or an au pair, or marrying a French person. The one that seemed to fit us best was the “D” visa or long stay “visitor” visa. This is actually a little confusing to everyone involved, because I’m going to be working from home essentially, but not for a French company and not doing business in France.
The “D” visa essentially asks you to prove that you can live in France without ever being in danger of getting a job at a French company. I believe it’s normally for people who sort of want to long-vacation in France or semi-retire there, but working for a strange company that lets you work from anywhere fortunately and also occasionally frustratingly blurs the lines. Countries don’t really know what to do with people like me. However, this is the best option I could find that fit me.
Now then, there are 14 steps to the visa application process.
Most of these were actually fairly simple. Some pictures at the Kinkos, fill out the visa form, get your passports, birth certificates and marriage certificate together, etc.
There were, however, some difficulties. Many of which may have been easier had this blog post existed for me.
The first was the “Letter promising not to engage in any employment”. I have no idea what this means. What’s even more confusing about it is that the next thing you need is a “Letter of employment”. This is one of those many instances where language is really quite vague. What I ended up taking this to mean, and which I basically had to specifically verify with the Visa Officer at the French Consulate, is that they mean “We need a letter saying you won’t get a job at a French company, depriving a Frenchman of a job, so prove to us that you have your financial shit together”.
Figuring out what that letter was supposed to say in order to get it signed and notarized was also a little frustrating. There are no templates or anything. We ended up just writing:
“I, <your name here>, promise not to engage in any employment in France.”
And then signing it. And then notarizing it. And then getting weird looks from the Notary Public because why the hell would you notarize that? We got it notarized at the Post and Parcel in Potrero on 18th St. They were super nice and patient with us, I highly recommend them.
The letter of employment was sort of weird, since I’m a cofounder and board member at my company so I was unsure who I was supposed to get to sign it. “Dear France, I work for me. Love, Scott”.
I assume, however, that most people don’t have that issue. They ended up not accepting it anyhow because it didn’t state that the company planned to continue to employ me once I was in France, which is what the consulate was looking for. If you do this, be sure to get that in the letter, in addition to your salary and title. In my case, the proof of means of income was enough that they didn’t much care about the employment letter — basically as long as they don’t think you’ll try to get a job for a French company or that a Frenchman could get, it doesn’t seem to concern them that much.
Proof of medical insurance was a pain for me, but mostly because it’s fairly rare for a US worker to move overseas and need to transition to expat insurance. Most of this was handled by our insurance broker eventually, but coming up with our medical history and whatnot took up most of a day. I ended up going into the consulate with emails saying I was going to get expat insurance and that I had travel insurance currently and they ended up being fine with that. I should do another blog post at some point about how ridiculous the American health care system is and how insane it is that we don’t really own our own medical records, but that’s for another time.
Proof of accommodation and the e-ticket were interesting requirements because they both require you to expend a rather grand amount of money to apply for a visa that in theory you may not be granted. I’ve heard on other blogs that you can get hotel accommodations and a refundable ticket to hedge your bets, but we actually rented a furnished apartment through Lodgis and bought our one way tickets before applying for the visa. Needless to say, I’m pretty glad we ended up actually getting it.
While we’re on that subject, here’s a quick tip. If you move to Europe for a year, buy round-trip tickets. Technically you can’t get a return ticket a year out, so I’m not saying figure out when to come back. I’m saying burn the return ticket.
I didn’t even think about it and one-way tickets were about $2200 each on United so I ended up getting us tickets on Canada Air with a stop in Toronto for about $800 per ticket through some super-shady seeming Kayak referral company. I was fairly certain we were going to get to the airport and the flight wasn’t going to exist.
However, if I had selected a round-trip flight with pretty much any return date, I could have gotten non-stop flights to Paris through United for like $1100 per ticket. Basically adding the extra 15 hour flight home saves you half of your ticket price, contrary to all rational possible logic.
For the love of God, buy round-trip tickets.
We also had to get Josie a new passport since we got her one when she was only a few months old and they only last five years. The passport you have when you apply has to be valid a few months past the end of your stay. Since Jo was almost five when we applied, the passport would have expired during our stay in France.
Getting a new one for her was pretty interesting. We had to do it in person since she’s a minor and appointments were all months away so we had to use the first-come line at the Post Office on Sutter.
There is basically a single place you can get same day passport appointments in San Francisco and it’s pretty much a total shit show. The office opens at 8:30a and by 8:32a there are 15 people in line for a single person working the Passport counter and each applicant takes at least 10 minutes. If you’re there the second the office opens you still have a 45 minute wait. The first time we showed up, I forgot a document too, so we had to do it a second time. Make sure you have everything before you go. Or plan this far enough ahead of time that you don’t need to go into a no-appointment passport office.
So we made the visa appointment about a month and a half in advance and set to work doing all of that, which was pretty easily do-able within that time. Other than the health insurance issue, which ended up being fine, we had no other real problems with any of the requirements.
The visa appointment itself almost could not have been easier. For one, we lived in San Francisco, so we could easily go there in person without having to travel or anything. I had also heard that it could be difficult or confrontative, but everyone we met was really patient and nice to us. Some consulates ask for a “statement of purpose” I’ve heard, but the San Francisco one did not and honestly I think the French are generally like “Of course you want to live in France, France is awesome!”
The only problem that we had was that we physically had our documents in the wrong order. They want them all in exactly the order listed, per person. We had something like “one for me, one for her, next for me, next for her”, etc. They wanted everything for me in order, then everything for her in order. We had to stand there and reorder everything and I don’t think the consulate officer was super happy with us about that. So, make a note if you’re doing this with your family.
Also, minors don’t need visas. Obviously we would have had to get her a new passport anyhow, but we didn’t need to pay the application fee or get her photos or anything. They ended up processing it for her and surprisingly actually issued her a visa (which the officer said they normally don’t do for minors), but it wasn’t necessary. It turns out if the parents get visas, they let their children come with them.
The next step was to find a school for Josephine. This was actually one of the first things we started looking for, but it took us a while to choose, apply for and finalize. It was also pretty stressful looking for a school when you can’t really visit any of them, communicate or search very well in French.
I first started emailing schools in early May, before we had really decided to move. Getting Jo into a school that we felt comfortable with was a prerequisite to moving at all.
It was actually a pretty interesting juggling act, because we wanted to find an apartment, a school for Josie and a language school for Jessica and have them all be relatively close or commute-able. We decided to start with Jo’s school and we narrowed it down to six schools that have at least some English instruction (we had heard that it can be very stressful for English-speaking children in fully French schools as they’re basically special needs children and we’re not citizens — it gets confusing).
A lot of the choices came from an article on EasyExpat.com and a few other searches. We basically ended up deciding based on the fact that only two of the six schools got back to my email at all and one of them was very responsive and easy to communicate with. Perhaps not the greatest way to choose a school, but possibly not the worst way either and it seems to be working out well for her. They do French about half the time and English the other half.
If you are considering moving to Paris and have a child, the following school was personally recommended to us by a local as a great bilingual school for kids who speak English: L’École active bilingue Jeannine-Manuel in the 15th arrondissement. They also recommended École Alsacienne in the 6th, which is on the EasyExpat.com list, while Jeannine-Manuel is not.
We ended up finding an apartment that took cats (whom we decided to try to take with us, more on that later), had an extra room for me to work in and was furnished. It is also nicely close to a Metro line that goes almost directly to Jo’s school. Finally, it was only a short walk to a great language school that Jess decided to enroll in. Everything’s comin’ up Millhouse!
So now that we have a place and schools and plane tickets and visas, we’re really moving! Now the problem is what to take with us. Since the apartment is furnished and it’s going to have to be difficult to ship stuff to France, we decided to basically try to store almost everything. Like, everything we’ve accumulated through 12 years of marriage and 5 years of having a child. However, there were some children's books, technology and clothes and things that would certainly be more than we could check and didn’t really want to re-buy, so we decided to try to ship a couple of boxes.
So now the question is, how do you get a few boxes of stuff shipped to France? Turns out that it’s not actually very easy.
I found out that there is an International Flat Rate 25kg (about 50 lbs) box that you can, in theory, ship to France relatively easily. So we picked up four of them and packed them full and just stored everything else in our lives. This is sort of an interesting philosophical game within your family — what can you live without? At about $300 per box, it’s a really compelling question.
Well, I thought we could just show up to the FedEx with these boxes and pay the flat rate and boom. Nope. Turns out that the boxes are going through customs so you have to declare everything in the box on a form. Literally everything. If you have 5 pairs of shoes you have to list them one item at a time and put how much they’re worth and where they were made and where you got them. For each pair of shoes. I had fucking USB cables and shit in there.
This was incredibly frustrating because we had tons of stuff in these boxes. How much is a jacket you got 3 years ago at Marshall’s worth? I got super frustrated and came damn close to just walking out of the FedEx in a huff when Jessica stepped in and just went through all their hoops. Because she’s a better person than me. So anyhow, if you want to ship something this way, figure out what’s in each box exactly and be prepared for literally hours worth of paperwork at the FedEx office.
We are not smart people. We’ve adopted three FIV-positive rescue cats during our marriage, two of whom are still with us. Technically they’re feral rescues, but only one of them acts like it.
So one of the earliest conversations was what to do with the cats. Do we give them up? Do we see if we can get a family member to watch them? Do we take them with us?
This was actually a pretty difficult conversation because there is no way anyone would ever want these cats. They’re both super sweet, but they’re also FIV-positive which means they have occasional (or in the case of the one, constant) health problems. Problems which can sometimes be expensive. We are literally the only humans on the planet that would continue to keep these cats alive.
What made things a little easier is that it turns out, contrary to what we had both believed, domestic cats don’t have to go through a quarantine process. It’s actually somewhat simple to move to another country with them, process-wise.
You have to get sky kennels that meet the USDA and IATA requirements for shipping live animals. We initially got ones that were way too small for international travel and had to buy new ones. You have to get a vet that is licensed by the USDA to check the animals and they have to be chipped with an international chip and get a rabies vaccine booster. Then within a week of leaving you have to make an appointment to go to the USDA/APHIS office and present all of the forms that your vet gave you.
We went to the APHIS office at 389 Oyster Point Blvd, Suite 2 in San Francisco (really far south, by the airport). The USDA person there was super nice and everything went pretty smoothly. Our vet at the Mission Pet Hospital in San Francisco was able to put all the documentation together for us, including the French forms.
You can find most of this online, but in several different places and it can be a little confusing. We thought that we had to take the cats to a special USDA vet or something, but that wasn’t the case — our long time vet was able to do it and we just had to take the forms to the USDA/APHIS office.
Finally you have to call your airline and make sure they have an animal hold on the flight you want to book. Actually, technically, you want to do this first, since the rest of this is done in the last weeks before you take off. Then on the day of, you have to go to the cargo area of the airport and drop them off, present the forms the USDA gave you and off you go. When you land, you pick them up from the cargo area there. Not the easiest, certainly, but not impossible.
You can also bring smaller animals on the plane with you sometimes, but I thought our scaredy-cats would be less stressed if there weren’t a thousand people around.
Then it was just the moving process. We hired horrible movers who took forever, like multiple days, and still didn’t finish everything. Which means we ran out of time and I had to hire DeliverSF to come to our house after we had flown away to finish up everything.
We got an AirBNB in the last few days to stay in while we coordinated all the moving out and cleaning up.
Strangely, the morning we were to leave there was a 6.0 magnitude earthquake that woke me up a little early. I guess San Francisco didn’t really want me to leave. Finally, we got up and took a cab from the AirBNB in the early morning to the airport.
It’s actually pretty jarring to leave. All three of us have lived in California for our entire lives. Jess and I both grew up in Ventura and both went to college here. We moved to the Bay Area basically exactly the time we got married. Our entire 12 years of marriage, all of our real adult lives in truth, have been spent here. It is a world we know and a world we love. Stepping outside this zone of incredible comfort and support for us is harder than I thought it might be, the lure of adventure aside. However, I think it’s the right choice. Stepping into the uncomfortable is the only way to ever do anything truly amazing.
So, au revoir, San Francisco and hello, Paris! I hope you treat us well.

It’s been a good long while since I popped on here to share anything about books and/or life, but when life gets busy I tend to get quiet. As any of your in corporate life know, the first quarter comes in like a lion with everyone ready to do All The Things as quickly as possible.
But stepping back in time to last fall, I wanted to share two special trips that Sergio and I took in 2023. Coming into 2020 we had talked about our desires to take our parents on bigger trips — rather than looking back with regret when they were at an age when traveling was more challenging, we wanted to prioritize these trips.
One global pandemic and more than three years later, we finally made good on these plans at the end of 2023 — a trip to Paris and Rome with Sergio’s parents and sister, and a separate trip to to Prague, Dresden, and Berlin with my parents and my brother.
Anyone who knows me at all knows I’m itchy and somewhat twitchy if I don’t have a trip planned, but a multi-generational trip was something a bit different for me. Today I’ll share some highlights and what I learned from our first trip with the Ricos to Paris and Rome, but if you don’t make it any further than this, remember that planning — along with realistic expectations — are your best friend.
Alors…
I have nothing but love for Paris — and I’m talking about pre-influencer Paris, but the Paris of 2023 is far different than my first trip to the City of Light in 2008. Back then we carefully held onto our museum passes as they were stamped one by one, made sure we had enough euros for everything, and bought packs of tiny paper tickets to use the Metro.
NO MORE MY FRIENDS, NO MORE. If you expect to show up and walk into anything, you shall spend your vacation in lines. It’s not that Paris hasn’t always been this beautiful or popular, but that international travel is more accessible to more people than ever! This is amazing, but is particularly tricky if you’re going to tour Paris with people who aren’t ready to run to and fro, this is where your planning has to start.
After spending some time re-familiarizing myself through the prolific works of St. Rick Steves, we implemented one of my favorite travel strategies when traveling in a group, What’s Your One Thing? It’s exactly what it sounds like — what is the one thing in this particular city that you must do, that thing you’d regret skipping? Prioritization is critical on any big city trip, but when you’re considering different physical abilities or budgets, this is the best way to include the most-desired spot for each traveler (no-vetos!).
[Mine tends to be some sort of museum or cultural site because I AM ME and I could spend an entire vacation doing three museums a day and then reading alone in a hotel room at night but again, that’s just me!]
The great news? Paris has so many lovely sites and many of them don’t suffer from a repeat visit. We also tend to have similar travel preferences — none of us were there for the nightlife or the boutique shopping or Michelin restaurants. That made it rather simple to make sure that Sergio made it to Versailles and I got (another) visit to the Rodin Museum, which really and truly is my favorite in Paris while my sister-in-law got her show at Moulin Rouge.
With your initial list of sites, I recommend putting together a shared Google Map with all of the possibilities. This is important for any trip, but we found it especially necessary for traveling with our parents (all in their 70s) to minimize the amount of walking or number of Metro transfers. This allows you to make a call on what sorts of transport make sense for a particular city.
If it is accessible to you — and let’s be honest, a lot of it isn’t — the Metro is the best way to get around Paris (get a Navigo pass with a photo — it took us 45 minutes to figure it out but I was proud that we did it!). However, it’s full of steps with many stations lacking elevators or escalators. We lucked out in that we were able to make it work — barely. The traffic in Paris can be really horrific but we did use Uber when needed instead of walking (my personal preference) to make sure that we were pacing ourselves as a group.
Thank you, Internet, for making it easy to add restaurants to our shared map as well. If you spend more time than expected in a museum, it’s tempting to stop into the nearest cafe to eat. However, a little bit of research gave us multiple options to make sure we could find different types of cuisine to try (and was helpful for me given my dietary restrictions). We also split up at times to try different spots, especially when we had differing levels of hunger (Sergio and I tend to eat 3 American Square Meals and the rest of the family follows the Latin country cadence of breakfast, late large lunch, and small or no dinner).
Another set of activities that is great for senior travelers would be bus, boat, or (in Rome) golf cart tours! These maximize the sites you can see while seated, and, if done early in your time in a city, provide a good overview. I did a lot of research to pick a good boat tour in Paris and a golf cart tour in Rome because some of these companies really cater to the unprepared, which could mean more time in lines and possibly a sub-par experience.
Random isn’t a good plan for big European cities these days — you’ll need a reservation for major sites like the Louvre or the Eiffel Tower (which we missed — oops!) or you’ll stand in a long, long, long, long line, or just be completely out-of-luck. The Paris Museum Pass helps get you into many sites, but separate entry reservations are often required. In Paris, big sites also mean security lines and possibly restrictions on bags that you can bring with you. This is where a Rick Steves guide comes in handy — you can learn which entrance is fastest at the Louvre or how to see St Chapelle before the security line is too long.
What we ended up with was a great blend of structure and flexibility. We planned one key event each day (eg; a museum, a tour, a day-trip) and a meal together. This was usually in the morning, as getting to an attraction first thing can mean a shorter security line (sometimes). Because our hotel had a great breakfast buffet, it was easy to get up, grab something to eat, and get out off the door by 8:30 or 9:00. This generally resulted in a lunch around 1pm, which created a natural breaking point. Folks could rest or nap at the hotel, or we could go to other interesting sites or shop in the neighborhood. This left time to find souvenirs, try desserts, or find another Engligh language bookstore (hi, it’s me) or even just walk through a church or a park. It also means you’ll stop by secondary sites and get to know them well — whether it’s the very under-rated church of St. Sulpice, the Paris Zoo, the Conciergie, or Napoleon’s Tomb (aka three miles of walking that looks like three blocks — whoops!).
Paris is much easier if you can speak some French — and as the only sort-of French speaker on the trip, I was the one who stepped in if no-one spoke English. I find the French to be generally kind and helpful if you are polite (not a loud American) and are respectful. This means saying bonjour when you enter, asking before you handle produce at a market, etc. These are actually very simple things to do — any good guidebook can help you! — that show respect and create goodwill for an interaction. Most people in France can speak some English (or are completely fluent) and are generally willing to switch to English if you graciously ask, Parlez-vous Anglais, s’il vous plait? That being said, I knew enough that when we did encounter people who didn’t speak English that we were able to get by in French (think of immigrants who are newly-learning French to make their way in the country). I think with joy about a lovely woman who cooked us the best meal in France in a tiny kitchen in a market who spoke French and Arabic — so my sad French got us through it! It’s one of my favorite memories of the trip because you don’t need that many words to share a connection with someone else. Don’t always believe the hype — start by asking yourself how you can adapt to get the best experience and go from there.
But before too long, it was time to travel to Rome. After researching options the most cost effective — balanced with the amount of time — was to fly. All I will say is this — coach seats on ITA are punishingly small and you always need an extra hour in CDG, no matter how fast you think it will be.
So, let’s keep this honest. Italy is my least favorite country in Europe.
It’s closely followed by Spain (super surprising given that I visited it with a Spanish speaker, but it was the wrong type of Spanish, the Latin-American variety…), but I wanted to give Rome another good try. I know so many folks who love it and it’s full of incredibly history and museums, which is perfect for me. Our previous visit was in December, which was a little bit less engaging — and we also struck out the food. I also had travel companions that were incredibly excited for Rome, so I wanted them to enjoy it too.
Those fantastic planning skills I mentioned above? These were even more critical for Rome because holy crap was the city overrun with tourists in the second week of October and why is everyone doing a TikTok dance in front of the Colosseum? Given all of this, it’s much more important to prioritize your sightseeing and get creative with your entrance times and to make sure that you have enough shade, water, and rest for everyone, not just the elderly. There’s nothing like sweating through your entire outfit, right?
For some reason, some of the sites like the Colosseum or the Vatican Museums make it nearly impossible to get in without either buying a combo-ticket (which might include a site that you don’t want or an included meal you don’t want to eat) or joining a “follow-the-flag” tour. This was completely different than our visit six years ago, and it’s the absolutely worst. Most tickets are sold to resellars who maximize profit with these upsells, and even if you tried you’re not able to get these other tickets.
As a planner and an independent thinker I found this incredibly irritating and it felt to me like we had less flexibility! We had to check in more than 30 minutes early for a tour-guide who did a really poor job with the Colosseum, and without a combo ticket for a lunch we didn’t eat, we wouldn’t have been able to see the Vatican Museums or the Sistine Chapel (so you’re welcome, Pope Francis, for the extra donation to your country). Even with my months-ahead planning, we couldn’t get tickets for the Roman Forum — but in fairness, I was probably the most disappointed about that.
My favorite site this visit was the Capitoline Museum that overlooks the Forum and the Colosseum. Sergio and I hadn’t visited it on our first trip so this was my choice for my One Thing. We did it on the hottest day as some (but not all) of the rooms were air conditioned. With incredible art, architecture, sculpture, and views, it was almost tourist-free and quite enjoyable. The tablet guides were essential as none of us spoke Italian — and it was pure luck if you encountered someone who was fluent-ish in English. We also benefitted from an incredible cab driver who drove us around the back way so our older travel companions didn’t have to climb one thousand stairs to the top of the hill. I did appreciate the care and respect for elders that I noticed throughout the trip.
Central Rome is a rather compact, flat and walkable — minus temperates in the 80s and 90s and no real breeze to speak of. Another challenge to keep in mind if you are traveling with older people is that there is almost nowhere to sit down in public in Rome, and if you sit on the steps someone will come and angrily ask you to stand up. I’ve never been to museums where the only place you can really sit down is on a toilet when you need to use the restroom. Perhaps this is a reason so many people sit down in the church pews to rest aching legs and pray for a break!
The Metro is very limited so we used cabs to get around most days. Though they are in theory quite reasonable, we were overcharged more than once — even official cabs “forget” to run the meter. Because we usually had to take two cabs as we were five people, it was extremely obvious that a six to ten euro price difference in cabs that departed from and arrived at the same place one minute apart from each other were not on the up-and-up. Travel means getting ripped off sometimes, and thankfully this was the extent of it (or perhaps a slight mark-up on a dinner). We were very careful with our money and passports, especially in crowded areas, and we stayed in safe areas of the city. This is important for everyone, no matter your age, to be aware of your surroundings and know how to ask for help if you need it.
That’s not to say we didn’t have great cab experiences either — like this man who took all of us at once, or the gentle man who drove us from our hotel to the Vatican Museums, chit-chatting nonstop in Italian, but then, at a stoplight, holding out his hand to me and saying in perfect American English, “Hi, I’m Bob” and then right back to the Italian for the rest of the ride. Bob was good people.
These delightful local encounters are the ones I’ll remember the most, whether the accommodating and helpful staff at Hotel Lancelot, the wonderful woman who led our market tasting tour, or the staff at one of the cat sanctuaries who knew cat people when they saw them and let us get our feline fix, if only for thirty minutes. We were lucky to travel with two extroverts, and my beautiful and kind sister-in-law was made for the Italian joviality and spirit! Sometimes you envy those characteristics that are so natural for some people, but not for you.
Here’s the other part of a family trip that you can’t overlook — making space for alone time or couples time. As the most introverted person on the trip, I knew I’d do better if I built in some time for rest and relaxation. I chose not to go on a day-trip that Sergio planned for Orvieto — which was a wild success! — and instead visited a nearby church, had a long lunch, and napped and rested in our hotel. A part of planning is also understanding what each person needs from an energy standpoint. Do people need a midday rest or an extra hour to wind-down at night? Or do you do best with a morning coffee along before everyone else tromps into the breakfast room? Take that into account too — speak up for what you need to manage your energy and refrain from judging the energy or rest needs of your fellow travelers. We are all at our best when we can tap into the ways that we relax and recharge, whatever they are.
I do love trying local cuisine, so I made a point of getting deeper into restaurant research and we did find some real gems, from a wine bar across the street from stores that sold habits and candlesticks to a tiny neighborhood trattoria with the best truffle pasta I’ve ever had in my life. We splurged for one of Rome’s nicest old-school restaurant, complete with an incredibly kind waiter who teased and joked but provided best-in-class service and a whole plate of butter on request.
It was joyful to see these places through the eyes of Sergio and his family and to see them again in a different light for myself. I’m not naturally meant for Italy, I don’t think, but with a more positive frame of mind there were lovely things that I missed the first time around. And when you try different experiences and talk to locals, you can see a place through their experiences too.
The massive drawback to Rome was the hoards of tourists more interested in a dance or a pose in front of a fountain than learning about the two thousand years of history, culture, and all that happened in this place. It’s ROME! I wanted to yell at these folks who occupied whole sidewalks such that one had to step into traffic in the street to walk around them. This stupid sort of tourism that’s taking over places like Dubrovnik, Amsterdam, Venice, or Barcelona, not to mention the crush in smaller towns like Hallstatt, Bruges, or Porto. Of course everyone can want a photo to say, “Hey, I went to [insert cool place]!” You’ve been looking at our photos of amazing places that we visited throughout this entire blog.
But is that the attraction — just going there? Isn’t it more interesting to see the Chains of St. Peter or The School of Athens or Trajan’s Column? I’ll get down off of my cranky old person soapbox in a moment, but c’mon folks! You can sample great gelato and check out some art; you can get a cute photo at the Forum and see the temples. We are lucky enough to live at a time when we know more than ever about those who came before us and we’re lucky enough to have technology to help these sites come alive. There is a world behind a screen — so if you just want to hang out with your phone, give everyone else a break and perhaps stay home.
Where did I land with Italy? This second trip was certainly more enjoyable than the first because of my travel companions… and I think I’m good for now. We’ve visited about half of Europe’s countries, so I’m ready to see some of those first before another loop back to Italy.
But… all-in-all, this was a fantastic trip with all sorts of experiences where we lucked out with hotels and made do with the unseasonably warm weather. The planning truly made it easier to adapt to different travel preferences and needs, and I’d say the trip was a smashing success.
And now the plot twist. Because travel doesn’t always go as expected, does it?
We had all packed and were ready for our flights back home to the United States and Mexico, respectively. We had to be out of the hotel by 5:30am to catch our flight to London to transfer for our flight home and the rest of the Ricos had an 11:30pm flight back to Mexico. I woke up in a cold sweat at one in the morning and proceeded to be violently ill for hours and hours. I am so, so, so sorry to all of the poor people on our floor who had to listen to all of… that, but I was that special kind of sick where my only thought was don’t die don’t die don’t die. Sergio went down to the front desk in the wee morning hours and managed to keep our room for an extra day and change our flights with British Airways to the following day. I don’t remember much of it, but my body was shaking so hard with chills that my intercostal muscles ached for days afterwards.
This is probably a story for another blog, but I’m unfortunately much more of an expert on getting food poisoning despite how careful I tend to be with what I eat and drink. That is an unfortunate part of having an inflammatory bowel disease, but I’ve learned a lot through these experiences, and in the future I’ll find a non-gross, non-graphic way to share my recovery protocol.
I was very lucky to be traveling with a doctor (my father-in-law) and a nurse (my mother-in-law) and they have the world’s most tricked-out travel medicine kit that they opened to us. They were differently unlucky with their own flight delays (a late-night flight pushed eight or nine hours later into the morning)! Thankfully our second attempts at departure worked — we flew home without incident (and, in my case, with basically no food) and though it was a wee-hours-of-the-morning connection in Mexico City, the rest of the Ricos made it home too.
What would I leave you with from this trip? Do it. Take the trip and don’t wait. Make the best of what you have now because none of us are guaranteed good health into the future. In our case, all of the planning ahead of time made the trip much easier and removed a lot of mental load while we were there and gave us time to really connect and experience these places together. Whether it’s Rome or Paris, resting on a beach, climbing a mountain, or taking a cruise, you and your family are worth that time together. I hope you take it with those you love.
Au revoir, S
P.S. See you soon with a Jan/February book review and then (hopefully) another blog about our travels to Prague, Dresden, and Berlin with my family— our first European Christmas!

I kicked off the New Year alone in Paris with nothing to do.
It was my first ever New Year’s Eve spent out of the country, not to mention alone, and I had only a few short days to make a game plan. Right off the bat, I decided that, given the choice between an all-out nightclub with strobe lights and disco balls vs. staying home by myself with a bottle of red wine, I’d opt for the latter. But ideally I wanted to find some middle ground between the two — maybe a quaint bistro party with sparkling conversation en français, or possibly a sophisticated and slightly fancy family fête, complete with warm pork roasts, multiple rooms to roam, and a guest list of 40 people.
As soon as I started asking around, I quickly learned that local bistros either morph into club scenes or are shut down completely on New Year’s Eve. It would be hard, as a temporary city resident, to stumble upon the ideal setting and scenario on my own. I also discovered that most Parisians stay in for the ceremonious ball drop, surrounded by close friends and family, either gathering locally in the city or stead departing for their country homes. That left me with one option — somehow get invited to a Parisian house party.
There were two fairly significant problems with this plan:
Then of course there was the question of trust. You can’t just ask anybody off the street to join them for New Year’s Eve — there has to be some vetting factor to give yourself a little bit of security and peace of mind. So, over the next three days, I decided I needed to spend as much time as possible in local restaurants, cafés, and other local hangs in search of new friends to ring in the New Year.
As you know, I like traveling alone and do this with some regularity. It’s particularly fun for me to look for opportunities in social settings around me to interject myself and learn something new, and I have a few general rules that I follow when looking for the perfect hang:
With all this in mind, I set out to maximize the number of opportunities spent in these types of places over the next three days. Not going to lie — this is not always the most comfortable social experience. Here’s why. Even after I find a location — say, a café — that meets these criteria, the next thing to do is position myself in a location that invites conversation. If I’m at a bar or bistro bar, I will sit only one seat away from the next closest person at the bar, or sometimes even squeeze myself in as the open seat in between two smaller parties. This surprising social move, while slightly awkward for a moment, has been a pretty effective technique for me to at least trigger a small-talk conversation.
If there is nobody sitting in that area yet, the next best thing I can do is position myself in a highly trafficked location, make eye contact with everybody that walks by, and smile. In that one gesture I look for people who also happen to be showing up with a similar mission as myself: Making new fast friends. Sometimes, someone may walk in who’s meeting a friend running late, sometimes that smile may encourage somebody to sit down next to you, or sometimes I’ll get roped into a small group conversation nearby. Yes, I’ll be honest: This likely involves unbreaking eye contact with strangers for a few seconds longer than normal. The good news is that you can practice it and that there’s really no downside, as the chances of seeing anybody again are relatively remote.
If all else fails, I just use the resources around me and make small talk with the wait staff in French. In my case, this would inevitably throw off triggers and red flags to everyone around me that I’m not a native French speaker. Sometimes this would work to my advantage and another patron else would jump in and ask where I’m from. (People typically assume from my accent that I’m from the UK. On my proudest day ever in France, I was asked if I was from Belgium.)
But even if none of this happens and nobody strikes up a conversation with me, even if nobody sits close enough to me in order to start chatting, I have one strict rule for myself: Stay off my phone. Pulling out a smartphone at a restaurant or café is the kiss of death to meeting new people. It sends an instant sign to everyone around you that you’re more absorbed with whatever it is you’re doing, reading, or responding to than the environment around you. I’ve found that no matter how distractedly I fiddle with my phone, it’s still a real blocker toward meeting new friends in the real world. I try to keep it off the table and in my purse.
Instead, I carry a book. Oddly, reading a real, print book in public does not seem to have the same effect on people with regard to them keeping their distance. People seem to feel less threatened by it, and I get interrupted while reading all…the….time. The other benefit of having a book with you is that, even if you don’t achieve the holy grail of sparkling new conversation with strangers, at the very least you can fall back on a (hopefully) good read.
So, with this in mind and book in hand, I set out to make friends and conquer Paris. Some places where I made friends included:
But as of midday on December 31, while I had managed to meet about a dozen new people with these tactics, my New Year’s options consisted of the following:
Needless to say, this was not exactly what I was looking for.
When traveling alone, it’s always important to have a backup plan in any situation. In this case, my Plan B for New Year’s Eve was as follows: Wander around the neighborhood and try to find a happening (yet sophisticated) bistro party. (Note: This plan also also included stockpiling a bottle of champagne and some food at home, just in case I was unable to find anything interesting to do and needed to toast the New Year’s alone.)
I decided to take on a stretch of bistros in the 6th arrondissement along Boulevard Raspail, within walking distance of where I was staying. My loose game plan was this: Wander slowly past bistros, peer inside to scope out the scene and the people, and see if there is a venue or group that looks inviting enough for me to join. A few blocks away, I noticed a corner with 2–3 restaurants back-to-back. I decided to check it out. One of them was just a sit-down dinner spot, with families in mid-meal. The second was a bit more lightly populated without any buzz or energy whatsoever. The third, while also mostly comprised of families dining out, had one thing the other two didn’t — a large gathering area by the bar, which happened to be decked out with champagne flutes. Bingo.
Bypassing the crowds who were waiting for tables, I walked in, ordered myself a champagne, and waited. It was 9:30 p.m. Presently, there were two older couples at the bar and another family milling about. I guessed that more people would fill into this area as we approached midnight. I drank my champagne very….slowly…. But nothing happened. I passed the time by vigilantly watching the jazz combo that was floating through the restaurant and performing for different tables.
Unfortunately, by 10:15 p.m. not much had changed. Multiple other folks and families had wandered in and out of the bar, but merely as a holding area prior to their seated dinner. None of them seemed interested in talking to me. I was the only person there alone. Not great.
From the bartenders, I found out that there would be dancing downstairs leading up to midnight. “You’re in the right place,” he assured me. We’ll see about that, I thought. I looked outside. There were now easily 75 people waiting in a line to enter the building. So I decided to give it one more drink before trying my luck elsewhere. This time, I asked for a recommendation and was recommended a “mix-your-own” champagne cocktail with infused gin, raspberry syrup, and fresh berries.
About five minutes later, another couple approached the bar, decidedly younger than most of the other patrons I had met up that evening. They spoke in French with each other quietly as they poked through the cocktail menu, but then I heard the unmistakable query directed my way: “Excuse me, but what is it that you’re drinking?” I turned to see the woman pointing at my mix-your-own-drink creation and explained to her in French which beverage I had tried. She thanked me and turned back to her friend. She ordered the same drink. And, had I detected a faint accent in her French?
Going on a limb, I decided to try my luck, and I asked her in English: “Are you traveling in Paris as well for the New Year’s?” She looked at my silently for a full 10 seconds, and I panicked thinking how rude it was for me to assume her nationality. But then she replied. “Actually, yes. I’m working here teaching English to French children but I’m from Chicago. I’m Alina*. This is my friend, Georges*, a true Parisian, born and raised.”
This tiny intro was enough to catalyze a full-on conversation between the three of us, mostly in English, a little in French. I learned they were here because one of their good friends was the guitar player in the traveling jazz combo who had been performing around the restaurant.
“Oh bummer, you just missed them,” I remarked. “They were playing all over the restaurant but stopped about 20 minutes ago.”
“Actually, they are playing downstairs now,” Alina said. “We came to see them, and were supposed to be able to get in to see our friend but they told us that it’s for paying dinner guests only. We’re just waiting for them to come by the bar and let us down there.”
“Ah, so the dance party downstairs has already begun?” I asked. “Good to know. I’d love to check it out before I leave so let me know what you learn.”
We spent the next 10–15 minutes chit-chatting about my trip and their lives in Paris. He works in IT; she’s a new teacher who just moved to Paris a few months ago. They were both around my age. Georges grew up with Martin, the guitar player downstairs, and their friendship has continued to grow strong over the past decade or two. To show support for their friend, Alina and Georges left the house party to come and see their him perform. They really wanted to see the show.
At one point, Alina decides we should all make a break for it. Realizing that the entrance to the fete requires only acquiring a gold wristband at the door, we carried our cocktails and headed downstairs. Moments later, we found ourselves squarely secured inside of the jazz combo dance party, a spacious room lined on the perimeter with cocktail tables where families and couples sprinkled about. The room was bathed in a fuschia light, with the combo playing upfront. It’s decidedly classy. The lead singer fed the room’s vibe by offering us an American jazz classic; her nonchalance and easy vocalizations bounced off all of the walls.
The bar downstairs was lined with champagne flutes ready to be poured, and I headed over to investigate. But as soon as I did so, a man in a suit approached my new friends, sternly telling them in French something that appeared to make them both instantly dejected. At that, they started to head toward the door.
“Hey guys, wait — what’s up?” I called at them.
“We have to leave,” said Alina. “Apparently this party is for dinner guests only.”
“But don’t they know that you have a friend in the band?” I asked.
“Yes, we told them, but they are being super strict about it.”
“Hang on, that’s not fair. I didn’t have dinner here either.”
“Well you should stay for sure!” piped in Georges. “In fact, we need you to stay. Please go tell Martin how sorry we are that we weren’t able to see him.”
“What? So that’s it? You’re leaving?” I’m annoyed on their behalf. These folks came all the way from the 11th arrondissement to see their friend play on New Year’s Eve.
“Tell him we’ll be upstairs waiting. We’ll see you up there afterward I guess too,” said Alina, eying the door. “We have to go.”
And then they left, leaving me alone again. Glass of champagne in hand, I turned to face the music. But it wasn’t the same.
One of the best parts about traveling alone is that it’s pretty easy to slip through the cracks. If you walk into a packed restaurant with a line out the door, you can often cut it all on the spot by agreeing to sit in that one awkward seat at the bar. If you run into a café right as they are about to close, as just one person, they might make a late dish just for you. If you’re shopping at a boutique and trying to haggle for a certain promotional offer on your purchases, it’s more likely the shopkeeper will let an exception slide by for one person, as opposed to a small group. And if you’re hanging around a bar at a fancy bistro on New Year’s Eve for long enough, the bistro owners will decide it’s not a problem for you to bypass the “dinner guests only” rule and hang around until the clock strikes twelve.
But this time, it didn’t seem right for me to enjoy this party and the jazz combo while the friends who traveled across the whole city to see him couldn’t enjoy it too.
I considered my options:
Of the three of these, which do you think I chose?
A few more minutes passed as I assessed the scene around me. Waitstaff and bartenders were frantically darting in and out of the bar, preparing for the shift of the masses from upstairs to downstairs. But I needed a manager or head waiter of some sort. Finally, I saw a man in a custom-fit blazer race by me, monitoring the setting downstairs on his way.
“Excusez-moi de vous déranger, Monsieur, mais j’ai une petite question,” I announced. Translation: Sorry to bug you but I have a small question.
“Oui?” he turned his full attention to me. I began, to the best of my ability, a French persuasive argument.
“Well sir, as it turns out, I have two friends upstairs who at the bar who I would like to be able to join me downstairs. They are actually here because their friend is performing in the band, and they would really like to see him, but they were told that they can’t come downstairs as they did not eat dinner here. I understand this rule, but is there any way that they could come back downstairs with me to see him perform?”
He assessed me a bit more closely. I tried not to cringe at any grammar mistakes I had made in that plea. I thought about adding in one last caveat: “And since nobody here is dancing yet, I’m sure they would be up for it and liven up the room,” but decided against it, not knowing their tendencies in that area. At last, he nodded, took my champagne glass, and stowed it on the bar to be safe upon my return.
“Come with me,” he said. “Point out your friends to me.”
He hustled up the stairs, with me two quick steps behind. At the top, I stood next to him and pointed out the couple, and he rushed over to them, acknowledged what we had discussed, and began to lead them back in my direction. He had the hostess take care of their coats, and walked all three of us back downstairs together, calling out what he had done to the doorman on the way in.
And with that, we were reunited downstairs. Alina and Georges were elated, albeit a little confused. To be fair, so was I. But we didn’t overthink it. And within a matter of minutes, Alina (who apparently had taken years of swing dance classes back in the U.S.) was stepping her way around the dance floor. Georges, meanwhile, whose style seems more akin to that of Danny Kaye, literally stole the show on the last number with an improv piece of pantomime and hilarity as he cheered on his friend in the front of the room. It may have been one of the funniest things I have ever seen — it takes a truly brave soul to have no fear and to just dance with abandon like that. At the end of the set, the band got a hearty round of applause, and my new friends had their fair share of patrons run up to them and compliment their impressive dancing skills.
After the conclusion of the performance, I met the rest of the band, including Martin, the guitar player, and we spent the next 20–30 minutes chatting and dancing. But at 11:30 p.m., Alina and Georges realized that it was getting late, and they needed to head back to their other party. The three of them turned to me as they prepared to bundle up and leave: “Would you like to join us? We’re heading up to the 18th arrondissement with friends.”
I paused to consider my options. That was all the way across town, so if I were to attend, I would no longer be within walking distance of my return at the end of the evening. I looked back around the room again. While certainly a classy and fun party, being at this bistro alone was the epitome of finding loneliness in a crowd. Aside from Alina and Georges, nobody else had given me the time of day to chat. I decided I’d rather ring in midnight in the company of my new friends than around a group of anonymous strangers. It would be worth the trip. So the four of us hopped on the Metro.
As we approached the Concorde stop on the M8 line, my phone revealed that we’d crossed the threshold. “It’s midnight everyone!” I shouted to no one in particular. Our Metro car cheered. Outside we heard the roar of a collective crowd shouting and screaming somewhere above ground at Place de la Concorde. The doors closed and silenced the ceremony. Our driver gave the horn a few long “toots.” Alina started to sing “Auld Lang Syne.” By 12:01 we were already at the Madeleine Metro stop, and the moment had passed. It would be close to 12:30 a.m. before we would walk into the house party with more of their friends to be greeted by a warm group of Parisians in an apartment that smelled like a mix of champagne and cigarettes. And I wouldn’t have had it any other way.
*Not their real names.

Helping You Adapt to Life in France

I’ve strolled past dozens of brocantes (antique fairs) in my decade in France, but it was only last month that I finally had a mission which took me to one as a participant, not just as a passer-by.
I often tell friends that it’s important to commemorate milestones as you get older. When you’re younger perhaps your family or your superiors will do it for you (a graduation, a promotion) but later in life your achievements and milestones can and should be marked in some way. I tend to do this with a gift which I would ordinarily not have bought for myself, but justified because of an achievement. For example, after a month studying French in the Alps I bought myself a Mondaine Swiss Railways watch. I’ve loved the design since the first summer I spent in Switzerland (2014) and was mesmerized by seeing the railway clocks at all the platforms I stood on. It wasn’t until 2018, four years later, that I “decided” to mark my quantum leap forward in French that I made in the Alps with this gift for myself.
That brings us to my citizenship interview of a couple of months ago and a desire to mark the end of several parts of various journeys. I have loved the classic designs of Saint James for some time now, but have put off buying one of their sweaters (jumpers, my dear UK readers) due to cost. Good, long-lasting clothing does cost more, and I’m not hesitant to pay…

Paris is one of the world’s great cities. History, architecture, museums, food, culture, beauty, and walkability make Paris one of the world’s most popular travel destinations, with more than 30 million annual tourists and millions more business travelers. Despite this, Paris has had the reputation of not being a great running city, with crowds, pollution, congestion, and relative lack of running culture being cited as the cause. But this has started to change in the past few years, and we’re pleased to report that there are some fantastic running options in Paris. If you are staying in the heart of the city, running along the Seine is a treat, especially since there are now seamless paths, separated from cars, that go on for miles. One can also put together a nearly 10-mile “highlights of Paris” tour, which includes The Louvre, Eiffel Tower, Champs Elysées, and the city’s famous parks and gardens all in one run. Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes are two large and wonderful city parks at either edge of the city. And running along the Canal St. Martin’s meandering paths out to Parc de Villette is a treat. Further afield, running at Versailles will make you feel like a king.
A great resource for running in Paris is Free Paris Running Tours. Luke and his team lead wonderful, free running tours of one of the world’s most beautiful cities.
Staying inside the main beltway surrounding Paris will provide access to decent running options (see our “stay” section for recommendations). Good anchor/departure points for our best runs are Notre Dame (“Cité), La Bastille, and La Defense. A few particular recommendations for running in Paris: if you want to see some of the ‘tourist’ highlights, try to go early to avoid the crowds; take advantage of the fabulous public transportation and bike sharing system, which puts you within a 10–20 minute subway ride from some of the best runs, or allows you to do a longer ‘one way’ run; and pay attention to closing times for some of the parks. Also when we say “12e” that means “12th arrondissement”.
Paris is generally quite flat. There are hills in some of the park runs. As for weather, in Paris it is fairly continental. Winters can be chilly and damp, with occasional but rarely significant snow. Summers are generally lovely, with long days, and rarely overly hot, but quite humid.
7.3 miles, RT. Start: Notre Dame, Ile de la Cite. MAPOptions for longer — head west on south side from Champs de Mars.
Running on the banks of the Seine is one of the great runs of the world. Over the past few years, several sections have been turned into pedestrian-only paths, below the road, making running along the Seine in the heart of Paris a running heaven. Along the river, there are also great views of Paris’ wonderful buildings and landmarks. Starting at Notre Dame (or any point), head east on Ile La Cite over to Ile St. Louis, crossing a bridge over to the north side, or right bank. Then head west along the river, passing numerous landmarks: Centre Pompidou, the Louvre, Jardin de Tuilleries, Place de La Concorde, and the Modern Art Museum. At just over 4 miles, opposite Jardins de Trocadero, cross the Pont d’Ilena, over to the left bank. Head back east. Some of the nicest sections of the river run are along a section called Les Berges, between the Pont de l’Alma and the Musée D’Orsay. This section was formerly a highway but was beautifully developed into a path two years ago. Shorten the run doing less of the path or add to/vary it with incredible detour opportunities: Tuilleries, Champs-Elysees, Jardins de Trocadero, Champs de Mars, and Invalides. Adding all those would make this a 10-miler or so.
7 miles, out and back. Start: Champs de Mars. MAP
This can be part of a longer run or a distinct run. We continue the above, running west of Pont d’Ilena, along the lovely thin path of Ile aux Cygnes, then doing a tour of the park on Ile St. Germain. It can be joined with any parts of Seine run above, or any of the wonderful detours.
7.5 miles. Start: Pont Neuf. MAP
This route has all the best of the heart of Paris, combining parts of the Seine paths with some of the city’s most famous landmarks and beautiful places. Start on Pont Neuf, and head to the north side (‘right bank’) of the river. Run by the Louvre into the Jardin des Tuileris, straight into the Place de la Concorde and then along the wide paths of the Champs Elysées, continuing along the famous shopping section, to Charles De Gaulle Etoile/Arc de Triomphe. Take Rue Kleber south, to the Trocadero, and the gardens, with a great view of the Eiffel Tower. Cross the Pont d’Ilena, do a quick little tour around the Tower, and then along the wonderful paths of the Champ de Mars and then the paths through Invalides. The last mile is along the left bank of the river, passing the Musee d’Orsay.
Some of these areas are major sites on their own, so of course it’s possible to do just some sections.
The heart of Paris is graced by wonderful and historic parks. All have dedicated pedestrian paths wide enough for running. There are many options for running one or more of these parks, incorporating other sites and parts of the Seine river paths. Rather than proscribe a particular ‘run’, here’s a bit of info on each of the main parks.
Long: 8.8 miles RT, starting at the Arc de Triomphe. MAP. Short: save two miles by starting at Port Dauphine10k in the Park: follow “Tour de Longeur” from the Port de la Muette entrance
This is the loveliest, shadiest place for running in the heart of Paris. You’ll find hundreds of fellow joggers on a nice evening. There are some 35 miles of trails in the park. It’s hard to proscribe a particular run, but your best bet is to run around Lac Inferieur and Lac Superieur (5k). Then there’s the option to head toward the northwestern part of the park, using any one of a number of paths. On the good maps at all trail intersections, look for the 10k “Tour de Longeur”, most easily accessible from the Port de La Muette entrance. Our route starts at the Arc de Triomphe just for kicks. Easily accessible by Metro. Combine with Parc St. Cloud for an even longer run.
4.76 mile loop. Start: Chateau Vincennes metroGood add-on option: Run there from City Hall (Hotel de Ville). 3.7 miles one-way. MAP
This is the largest park in Paris, about 4 miles east of Notre Dame in the 12th arrondissement. The park was created between 1855 and 1866 by the Emperor Napoleon III. There are beautiful paths for running in this park. Highlights include the medieval Chateau de Vincennes, an arboretum, floral gardens, and numerous other natural and recreational facilities. The best bet is to randomly enjoy the miles of paved and unpaved paths. A tour of the outer perimeter trails is ~4.5 miles. Other options: 1 mile around Chateau de Vincennes; 1.4m around Lac Daumsenil. Or look for the “Circuits Pedestres”, which include 11k and 8k loops. Many more trails can be added. The trails are well signed, with mile markers. 15 minutes by metro. A good option for a longer run is from City Hall, which takes you by Bastille and then on some greenways and good running roads into the park. Do it one way and take the Metro back! Or, take the Promenade Plantée path back to Bastille, from Port Dorée entrance.
2.4 miles O-W. Start: Bastille or Porte de Montempoivre (metro Bel Air). MAPAdd-on options: Bois de Vincennes, Parc des Buttes Chaumont
This is a favorite Paris off-road path. Created out of an abandoned metro line, PlantPé is an elevated, paved linear park that runs 2.4 miles from Bastille in the Eleventh arrondissement to Porte de Montempoivre. You’ll see lots of other runners, and inline skaters. Just beneath the path, along the viaduct, there are shops, markets, and artist studios. There are numerous entrance gates along the way, each with their own opening/closing times. For a longer run, continue from the end of the path into Bois de Vincennes, which is 0.5 miles using Rue Sacrot (look for the Porte Dorée entrance), or mid-way along the Plantée path, from Jaures, head 1/2 mile east to Parc des Buttes Chaumont. Good hills there. Notes: There are signs that say “This place is a space for walking. Jogging is tolerated only to the extent that it doesn’t disturb walkers.”
5km of trails and good hills. Easy access via metro. Also 1/2 mile east of Promenade Plantée, 1/2 mile south of Parc de Villette.
A great park to do some hills. Unveiled at the 1867 World’s Fair, this park is sometimes referred to as the ‘Central Park’ of Paris. About 5km of trails, with the hilliest in the interior. Great to combine with Parc de Villette, or Promenade Plantée.
Short option: 3.2/6.4 miles out & back/RT. Start: Bastille. MAPLong Option: 5.2/10.4 miles out & back/RT. Start: Bastille. MAP
This is another wonderful linear park option from the heart of Paris. It follows the Canal St. Martin, which meanders its way from near the Bastille to Parc de Villette. The towpath is very pretty, with lovely chestnut trees shading some sections. The first section on our map is hard to see because it is below the street. Runners have a few options here: run one-way, 3.2 miles, and then hop on the metro back — multiple stations along the way and at the Parc. Or, it’s 6.4 miles RT. A longer option is to to enjoy some of the paths in Parc de Villette. A more modern, landscaped park, with interesting sites such as the Géode, a 36-diameter sphere, garden of mirrors, the garden of trellises, and the garden of islands, connected by ~2 miles of paths. Then return, for a long 10.4 mile run, or hop the metro.
4.2 miles RT. Start: Esplanade de La Defense metro. MAPAdd-ons: it’s 3k to the Palais de Congrès, which also abuts Bois de Boulongne, and 4k to the Arc de Triomphe.
La Défense is Paris’ version of London’s Canary Wharf/Docklands. It’s a business-centric district of modern office buildings on the edge of town. It started in the 1970s but it is still growing. As with most things Paris, this area has been built on a grand, post-modernist scale. It’s pretty convenient — ~2 miles from the convention center. Running in this area is pretty good: long, wide plazas and pathways with trees, monuments, and places to shop and eat. Start at the Esplanade de Défense or anywhere in that vicinity, and continue along the Allée to the Grand Arch, which is a modern version of the Arc de Triomphe (note it is is a 5k straight shot from ‘Arc to Arche’). Note it’s a bit tricky connecting from the Arche into Nanterre, but a run into Parc André Malraux is worthwhile. There are ~2 miles of trails in here, including a couple of hills! On the return, pass by the “Cloud Towers”, and Rue Hoche leads to a bridge over the freeway and back into the La Defense area. There are good, business-y hotels in La Defense area.
Paris is a huge city. There are runs possible in every arrondissement or suburb. Here, we’ve highlighted some of the best ‘destination’ runs.
6.4 mile loop. Start: City Hall, Versailles. MAPEasily accessible by public transport from Paris. Open 8am-6pm
One of the most significant palaces in the world is also a great running destination. The Versailles Gardens are huge and open to the public, with many wonderful landmarks, including great views of the palace, a section of formal gardens and highly sculpted allées, and then, further westward, bucolic paths going by farms and fields. A great ~10k run is to start at City Hall right in Versailles, head into the Palace grounds, and along the formal gardens to the perimeter of the Grand Trianon, and then on the paths of the perimeter of the Canal and fountains. This is a total 6.4 mile loop. It’s easy to add another couple of miles using some of the more remote paths in the northern section of the park or running along the outer perimeter paths.
5 miles. Start: at park. Metro: St. Cloud, Boulogne. MAP
This beautiful park is a wonderful running option south of the 15th arrondissement, and not far from Bois de Boulogne. It has some of the most beautiful gardens in Europe. There are wonderful allées and paths for running. A good tour can easily add up to 5 miles.
Paris has a great variety of hotels. And even though the metropolitan area is large, anywhere inside the inner beltway (Blvd. Peripherique) will put you within a 1–2 miles of a good running option. It’s 7–8 miles east-west or north-south within the beltway. That said, easy access to the Seine and the major tourist sites, is in the 1st-7th Arrondissements. Arrs. 13–15, and 20 might have more budget friendly accommodation options but are a bit further from some of our best routes. But even if you end up some distance from an “ideal” running location, try to stay near a metro stop, as that will put you within 15–20 minutes of somewhere great for running. If traveling to Paris for business, it’s fine to stay in La Defense/Convention Center area. There’s good running there, and it’s not far from the Arc de Triomphe, and the Bois de Boulogne.
There is a growing number of running specialty stores in Paris:
Passion Running. Locations near La Bastille, Bois de Boulogne, and the outer 15th Arr. Group Runs: Saturday mornings.
Planet Jogging. Great location between convention center and Etoile.
Endurance Shop. Nearly 100 locations in France. In Paris, they have a store at Montparnasse, and at Versailles.
KM42. Near Parc Monceau. Having to do with the Paris Marathon.
Boutique Marathon. Near Parc Monceau and also Bercy.
There are also Nike, Adidas, and New Balance stores within the heart of Paris.
A great resource for running in Paris is Free Paris Running Tours. Luke and his team lead wonderful, free running tours of one of the world’s most beautiful cities.
Paris Running Tour also offers guided runs of Paris
Les Moustiques. Welcomes runners of all levels to train in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. The club meets Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. at the Paul Valéry stadium in the 12th arrondissement.

Paris is home to the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, the Notre Dame and many more iconic landmarks. It is the city of fashion, haute cuisine and lights. As one of the most popular tourist destinations, it exerts an enormous attraction to people all over the globe: in 2023 it received more international visitors than New York, Bangkok or Mecca.
When we think of Paris, we picture a city with grand boulevards, lined with stately buildings, between which little alleyways meander. Here locals chatter on the outdoor terraces of countless bistros and brasseries while enjoying the culinary delights.
This romantic image of the French capital is true only to some extent. It’s not something the majority of the 11 million inhabitants of the Paris metropolitan area experience in their daily lives. Paris has long outgrown its historic core: most of the people who consider themselves Parisains today live in the city’s suburbs: the banlieues.
The Paris within the Périphérique (the ring road which encircles Paris proper) is world-famous. The suburbs which lay outside it remain mysterious places.
In today’s article, I want to shine a light on Paris’s banlieues: their history, their development and their…

Victor Hugo, Marcel Proust, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and many others have captured the essence of Paris in their writing, and numerous poets have used this city as their muse. For artists and creators, Paris is a city of sensations, of layers, of contrasts and defies easy categorisation.
Walking the streets of this city, I felt all the hopes, aspirations and fantasies that are often excluded from my conscious personality in everyday life come alive—the determination never to be disappointed by life, to see only what is beautiful, good and kind.
I had strangers smiling at me and that lively “Bonjourrrr”. I admired Parisians going about their daily lives, running up and down the path beside the Seine. I watched a group of French women having their passionate intellectual debates in a restaurant before going to their yoga class. I watched people wandering through the Sunday flea market in search of the perfect vintage garment. I have admired femininity and the art of true seduction, the very definition of naked couture at a cabaret show, reminiscent of a simpler time when natural beauty was cherished.
For artists who have often felt left out or like they don’t belong because their upbringing or culture doesn’t support the arts or embrace creativity, Paris is a breath of fresh air. Going to a country where the government itself has a history of supporting the arts and culture makes you feel seen and understood.
Sous le ciel de Paris, I was reminded that what I do matters, and for the first time I didn’t feel that my romanticism was being challenged or stifled. I didn’t feel at war with myself.
I felt at peace.

A Data-Backed Travel Guide
After binge-watching Emily in Paris (no judgment, please), I’ve been dying to stroll along the Seine, bite into a flaky croissant, and soak in the city’s magic — art, love, history, the works. But I’m also a data nerd who loves a good deal, so I wasn’t about to splurge on flights.
I gathered flight prices from Singapore (SIN), London (LHR), and New York (JFK) to Paris (CDG) to study travel patterns from different corners of the world — Asia, Europe, and North America — and find the cheapest month to visit Paris in 2025. What I found surprised me: a secret sweet spot where prices drop, crowds thin, and Paris still sparkles — plus a month so overpriced and packed it made me rethink my plans.
Paris reinvents itself with each season, and timing can make or break your trip — especially if you’re budget-conscious. Here’s the quick rundown:
Timing matters because each season shows a different side of Paris — and impacts your wallet.
November is your golden ticket.
Flights from LHR averaged $125, SIN $350, and JFK $300 — the lowest I found all year. Why? It’s late fall in Paris (6–11°C), meaning fewer tourists clogging up the Louvre or the Marais. My price trend plot confirmed it: November was the cheapest across the board. Sure, it’s chilly — pack a scarf and a jacket — but imagine this: you’re sipping hot chocolate by the Seine, golden leaves falling, and you didn’t break the bank to get there. That’s November in Paris.
If November’s too cold for you, consider September to October. My daily price trend plot showed prices stabilizing during this period — before spiking again in late October. Wonder why the stability? Summer’s rush (think families on school break) fades, and demand drops as kids head back to school. September’s still mild (13–21°C), with fewer crowds and scenic fall vibes — perfect for a bike ride along the Canal Saint-Martin. October cools down (9–16°C) but keeps the charm, with autumn colors popping in the Tuileries Garden. Just watch out for late October — prices start creeping up as holiday travel looms.
Here’s the month I’d dodge like a tourist trap: August. My price trend plot showed a steady climb through the month, peaking near the end. Why the spike? It’s peak summer (16–25°C), and Paris is swarming with tourists soaking up the sun. Plus, many Europeans (including Parisians) take their annual holidays, so the city’s packed with visitors while locals escape to the coast. If you hate crowds (and overpaying), August is a hard pass.
My price trend plot revealed a wild ups and downs from June to July. What gives? June is the tail end of shoulder season — still warm (14–23°C), but demand hasn’t peaked. Come July, summer hits full swing: school holidays kick in, Bastille Day (July 14) draws crowds with its parades and fireworks, and Paris becomes the place to be. More demand, higher prices — it’s simple economics, but it stings.
Here’s the deal: book your 2025 Paris trip for November. You’ll save big, enjoy a quieter city, and still get that Parisian magic (pro tip: pack a scarf — it’s chilly).
Have you visited Paris during an off-season month? Did you find hidden deals, or do you think the summer hype is worth it?

Outline of a talk at the Critical University 15 May 2021
If we go back to March 18th, and look at the famous imagery of the National Guard on their barricades, we’re only seeing one half of the story. This is the French labour movement as it saw itself: orderly, respectable and quite obviously gendered — the men have the guns, flags and uniforms, the women and children stand to the side.
The battalions were rooted in local communities but, as Martin Phillip Johnson shows, there was a lot of crossover — so that a man in one area might actually travel to be with friends in another area’s battalion. Which suggests they were based both on community and workplace.
But March 18th itself, and the subsequent trajectory of the Commune as a revolutionary government, involved a completely different demographic: la canaille, the mob: the shanty-dwelling ultra poor, including migrants from outside Paris, overlapped with the classic bohemia of artists, impoverished law students, registered sex workers, slum children… and nobody took their photos, although they drew them.

On 20th May 2024, our most awaited day was here. It was the first day of our fortnight-long planned package tour of Europe. We covered the following countries- Netherlands, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Italy, Slovenia, Vatican, and Germany for a span of two weeks.
This trip was a result of three months of extensive planning and preparation. There were massive discussions and contradictions within our family on which travel agency should we choose, which itinerary, the budget, VISA appointment, purchasing and much more.
We consulted many relatives, friends, family friends, those who have been on a European trip, and much more. At last, we booked our travel with Soman’s Leisure Tours, Kochi. On 30th April, we had our VISA appointment.
On the 10th we had an online meeting with the tour company explaining the guidelines for the trip. They instructed us about currency, international SIM and much more.
18th, Saturday was the day when we started to put together things. Despite that, we could not have successful progress on that. On the 19th we had to go to our ancestral place hence, it was indeed a tight…

I think the way French people say, “Bonjour!” is sensuous. Just two syllables. Or two musical notes, rather.
Shopkeepers, waitstaff, and bartenders all seem to sing when they greet me with “Bonjour!” or “Bonjour, monsieur!”
Nothing about me asks to be serenaded. I’m an older American male of Chinese ethnicity, not immediately charismatic, nor sharply dressed, nor classically good-looking, nor anything. On my better days, I could perhaps pass for an expatriate, but more often, I probably come off as a seasoned tourist, which, at least, is accurate.
Everyone gets this greeting, not just me. But alas, not everyone responds in a way that matches the greeter’s sensuality. They should. We could all use a bit more sensuality in our lives, no matter how small.
I wish to blend in, to “live like a local” as many travelers like to say. So, whenever I’m greeted, I feel the need to respond in kind. Thus, I reply, “Bonjour!” in the best French I can muster, which causes me to mimic that same songlike quality. “Bonjour!” I feel better just saying, er, singing it.
For example, I found myself singing at 9:15 am as I entered La Crémaillère 1900 in Montmartre on a chilly, misty April morning. Still sleepy, and before my morning coffee.
Singing “Bonjour!” in response to the server uplifts me. Sure, it’s only two notes, but it’s two more notes than I sing when I enter a café near my home in New York City.
By the way, I wrote my first draft of this story in this café, and all the photos in this article are of this establishment.
If you must ask, I had the “Pain perdu au caramel beurre salé” or “Salted butter caramel French toast.” Yes, it was as sensuously decadent as that reads.
Some say that “Paris est un village,” and I can see why. Few other large cities I’ve experienced greet me like I’m in a small town, but people here do this naturally.
I found out later that all of French society conspires to do this, not just Parisians. French children are consistently taught to say “bonjour” and “au revoir” to their peers and adults. Some say it’s a way to acknowledge another’s humanity.¹
I live in New York City, where we value efficiency. We can’t be bothered with fussy things like greetings, especially with strangers. Often just a direct, “Do you have the time?” or “I’d like a matcha oat latte, please!”
But is it really that fussy? It’s not like I’m being asked to say, “Good day to you, madame. You look quite well today.” Saying “hello” is only two syllables, just like in French!
I’m resolved to acknowledge my fellow New Yorkers’ humanity when I get home. I will sing “Hello!” to all of them, even if things get awkward. Maybe I’ll get a side job at a café or a Lululemon shop. Just for the practice.
Back in Paris, at bustling, understaffed restaurants, harried servers move quickly and efficiently. They don’t smile. They acknowledge me just long enough to indicate, yes, take any available seat. Maybe I’ll get a menu soon, maybe not.
But I always get a tonally cheerful “Bonjour!” paired with firm, if fleeting, eye contact.
The Middle Eastern immigrants working the kebab stalls greet me with a lilting “Bonjour!” The Chinese housekeeping staff at my hotel: “Bonjour!” Service workers who don’t even seem happy with their jobs, at least at that moment: “Bonjour!”
It’s as if those weary service workers are saying, “I’m unhappy right now, but I’m not taking it out on strangers. And so, I will sing because singing is good for my soul. Even if it’s just two notes.”
And if singing one’s troubles is good for one’s soul, does that mean complaining in French is more therapeutic than complaining in English? I’ve heard people complain in French many times, and it’s the cutest thing ever. I feel cathartic just listening to them, and I don’t even know what they’re saying most of the time!
French certainly sounds better than the flatter tones of my American English. In my home country, I hear the French language’s relative musicality exert its influence.
Does it sound more meaningful to say you’re a “hustler” or an “entrepreneur”? (Bonus: Say “entrepreneur” in proper French, with a crooked half-smile and a gleam in your eye for a self-effacing, satirical effect.)
What feels better to say after you emotionally process a major setback? “That’s life!” versus “C’est la vie!”
If you and your partner want to invite a prospective new lover to your bedroom, would you coquettishly propose a “threesome” or a “ménage à trois”?
I’m not an enraptured newbie à la Emily in Paris. This is my seventh time in Paris. I’ve been to other parts of France. I’m actually a sometimes-jaded traveler. I’ve studied French on and off for years.
While I’ve always loved French culture and people, after all these visits, I’m finally noticing and loving the soulful quality I hear in the French language.
That’s all I have about French greetings. Though, we haven’t discussed French farewells, which I find similarly lyrical. I guess you’ll just have to use your imagination when I say (sing):
Au revoir! Bonne journée!
As mentioned, all photos in this article were shot inside this café:
La Crémaillère 1900 (Yelp, Google Maps)

There’s an eclectic, egalitarian art gallery hiding in plain sight in Le Marais district in Paris. Its art pieces coexist with the chic boutiques and charming restaurants this area is known for.
Throughout these winding, intimate medieval streets, perched on walls above eye level (or below, sometimes) are street art pieces.
I love finding them amongst the teeming throngs of tourists. So many tourists. But who am I to hate on them? I’m a tourist myself, and I love Le Marais, just like them.
Several years ago, I did a street art tour of this neighborhood. The tour guide told me that residents here tended to be more tolerant of graffiti and street art. Artists, Bohemians, gays/lesbians, and other groups have at times occupied this area since the late 20th century.
I went back this year.
Just like years ago, it did not disappoint.
All photos in this article were taken by me in Le Marais during my April 2025 trip — except for this one below from December 2017, where I actually caught a street artist in the act!!
I’ve done my best to attribute the artworks that I know.
Back to this year.
I discovered this cute piece below.
I wondered if the raccoon stencil was part of the original piece or if another artist added it later. Did the original artist get annoyed or grudgingly accept it?
You had to walk down a nondescript residential street to find this one:
I don’t know why these artists are into vintage video game characters, but I find them cute.
On the left below is Super Mario by Invader (Official website, Instagram). That famous artist of those Space Invaders video game characters rendered as tile art throughout Paris and beyond.
Did you know there’s a FlashInvaders app that lets you “collect” sightings of Invader’s works? It’s totally a thing.
Below is more street art. I love the various forms and mediums this art can take.
Some pieces were stunningly intricate, as shown below. For pieces that clearly require so much effort, I sometimes wonder if artists seek permission from the building owners first or hope that the virtuosity of the piece earns enough respect to spare its destruction.
Le Marais is already delightful with its shopping, food, and vibes. You would not be faulted for enjoying only these things.
But there’s a playful, subversive layer if you slow down and look closely enough.
Next time you’re here, let your gaze wander more.
Or take a detour down that nondescript alley.
You may be rewarded with some artistic surprises!

“When you make a decision as a mayor, you immediately see positive and negative effects.” says Ms Anne Hidalgo, Mayor Paris
Since becoming the first female Mayor of Paris in 2014, Anne Hidalgo has championed an ambitious vision to make the French capital a global leader in sustainability and urban environmental innovation. Her policies, rooted in combating climate change and enhancing the quality of life for Parisians, have reshaped the city’s landscape, reduced its ecological footprint, and set a benchmark for cities worldwide. Hidalgo’s work reflects a commitment to nature, social equity, and a forward-thinking approach to urban living, earning her international acclaim, including a spot on TIME’s 2024 TIME100 Climate list. This article explores her transformative efforts to foster a greener Paris and secure a better future for its residents.
A Vision for a Greener Paris
Hidalgo’s tenure has been defined by bold environmental policies aimed at reducing pollution, prioritizing sustainable mobility, and reintegrating nature into urban spaces. Her overarching goal is to make Paris a “15-minute city,” where essential services—shops, schools, workplaces, and green spaces—are accessible within a short walk or bike ride. This concept, championed by Hidalgo and urban planner Carlos Moreno, seeks to reduce car dependency, enhance community living, and mitigate climate impacts.
Her initiatives reflect a holistic approach to urban planning, balancing ecological resilience with social inclusion.
Revolutionizing Urban Mobility
One of Hidalgo’s most transformative achievements has been her push to reduce car dominance in Paris, a city historically shaped by automotive culture. Since 2014, her administration has added over 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) of bike lanes, making cycling a viable and safe option for commuters. The “Plan Vélo” initiative has expanded cycling infrastructure, with dedicated lanes and bike-sharing schemes like Vélib’ becoming integral to Parisian life. Posts on X highlight the scale of this transformation, noting that Paris has built “+800km new bike paths” and reduced car traffic by 40% under Hidalgo’s leadership.
Hidalgo has also pedestrianized key areas, transforming the Seine riverbanks into car-free zones reserved for walkers and cyclists. The “Paris Respire” (Paris Breathes) initiative bans traffic in certain areas on Sundays and holidays, encouraging residents to reclaim public spaces. Major roads, including stretches along the Seine and iconic plazas like Bastille and Nation, have been redesigned to prioritize pedestrians and public transport. These efforts have led to a 40% drop in air pollution since 2014, significantly improving environmental health.
To further deter car use, Hidalgo introduced policies targeting high-polluting vehicles. Diesel vehicles have been banned from Paris by 2024, with all fossil fuel vehicles phased out by 2030. A parking tax on gas-guzzling SUVs and mandatory emissions stickers for cars entering the city reinforces these measures. These policies not only reduce emissions but also incentivize cleaner transport alternatives, aligning with Paris’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.
Greening the Urban Landscape
Hidalgo’s commitment to nature is evident in her ambitious tree-planting and urban greening programs. Since taking office, Paris has planted over 200,000 trees, with a pledge to add 170,000 more by 2026. Urban forests are being created near landmarks like the Hôtel de Ville, Gare de Lyon, and Opéra Garnier, with plans to cover 50% of the city with planted areas by 2030. A notable project is the transformation of the area from the Trocadéro to the Eiffel Tower into a 56-hectares wooded park, set to become a “green lung” for the city.
In 2022, Hidalgo announced plans for a 3.5-hectare urban forest in the 20th arrondissement, planting over 2,000 trees to combat heatwaves and enhance biodiversity. Her administration has also relaxed building codes to encourage residents to plant trees in their neighborhoods, fostering community-driven greening. These efforts address urban heat island effects, with Paris preparing for projected heatwaves exceeding 50°C (120°F) in coming decades.
Hidalgo’s vision extends to iconic landmarks. The Champs-Élysées, one of the world’s most famous avenues, is being reimagined as a “fantastic garden” by 2030, with wider sidewalks, more trees, and reduced car lanes. These projects not only enhance Paris’s aesthetic appeal but also improve air quality and urban resilience.
Making the Seine Swimmable
A hallmark of Hidalgo’s environmental legacy is her commitment to cleaning the Seine River, a symbolic and practical endeavor. Decades of pollution rendered the Seine unsafe for swimming, but Hidalgo promised to make it swimmable by the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Her administration invested heavily in wastewater treatment and stormwater management, resulting in a cleaner river. In July 2024, Hidalgo herself swam in the Seine to demonstrate its safety, a highly publicized moment that underscores her commitment to environmental progress.
The Olympics provided a platform to showcase sustainable urban practices. Temporary venues minimized new construction, single-use plastics were restricted, and equipment was redistributed for reuse. These efforts halved emissions compared to the 2012 London Olympics, aligning with Paris’s carbon-neutral ambitions.
Global Leadership in Climate Action
Hidalgo’s influence extends beyond Paris through her roles in global climate networks. As chair of C40 Cities from 2016 to 2019, she advocated for urban climate leadership, emphasizing the role of cities in meeting Paris Agreement goals. In 2023, she was appointed a Global Ambassador for the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy, where she pushes for city-level climate financing and ambitious emissions targets. Her work with figures like Michael Bloomberg and other mayors has fostered international collaboration on green policies.
Hidalgo’s leadership during the 2015 COP21 summit, where the Paris Agreement was adopted, cemented her reputation as a climate advocate. She co-hosted the Climate Summit for Local Leaders, empowering cities to set bold emissions targets. Her global advocacy underscores her belief that local actions drive systemic change, a principle reflected in Paris’s recognition with a UN Climate Action Award at COP26.
Visionary Leader
Ms Hidalgo argues that her policies, though polarizing, are necessary to address the climate crisis, a stance echoed by supporters like the former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who called her a “visionary leader.”
A Legacy for the Future
Her decade-long tenure has left an indelible mark on Paris, transforming it into a model of sustainable urban living. From reducing emissions by 25% between 2004 and 2018 to creating 45 kilometers of new parks and 180 car-free “school streets,” Hidalgo’s policies have prioritised nature and human-centric urban design.
Her work has inspired cities globally, proving that bold local action can address planetary challenges. As Paris prepares for a future of climate resilience, Hidalgo’s legacy—bike-filled streets, verdant parks, and a swimmable Seine—stands as a testament to her unwavering commitment to nature and a better future. In her words, “We have to dare, because tomorrow it will be too late.
Regards and a respectful salute to this great Climate Leader and Citizen Of Mother Earth, Ms Anne Hidalgo. It is because of the climate action by world citizens and leaders like you, life on Earth is safe for all living beings.

Before I moved to France, I used to think that French people were arrogant about their food.
Now that I’ve lived here for almost four years, I ‘now’ think that French people are very arrogant about their food.
It’s not that people here aren’t open to other cuisines. Heck, they seem to rate Italian and Japanese food pretty highly.
And it’s not that people from other countries don’t hold supremacist views of their own — at least as far as food is concerned.
But when it comes to questions about culinary sophistication, French people, by and large, take it as self-evident that French food is in a league of its own.
In a country where everything is subject to debate, questions as to French food’s superiority remain, ironically, off the table.
I’m painting in broad strokes, of course; not everyone thinks this way. But given how many times I’ve been privy to French people talking merde about other cuisines, I feel pretty confident about making this claim.
Make no mistake — I love France and the French people. It’s just that French arrogance about food is a tad annoying.

Since learning that the Louvre is undoubtedly the biggest art museum in the world, I have always been keen to visit this famous sight. My partner and I are both artists, and he wanted to see the Louvre, too. The only problem was that neither of us had any desire to visit Paris, and in fact, we were both a bit intimidated by it.
I can’t say exactly why this was. Maybe it was purely the fact that Paris is the most visited city in the world, and we tend to try to stay away from tourist traps as much as possible. Maybe it was because we heard that Parisians hate foreigners who don’t speak French.
It also might be because we heard that Paris is one of the pickpocket capitals of the world. And, oh yeah, we had heard that people were rude and unwelcoming.
Whatever the reasons were, they are long lost in my memory now because I can firmly say that Paris was not one of the stereotypes we had heard, and both of us were pleasantly surprised by the city and its residents.
I’ve said it before, and I will say it again: traveling to a place and experiencing it yourself is the only way to truly understand it. Trying to decide if…

Prior to parenthood, I lived in Paris, married a Frenchman, and enjoyed la bonne vie in our 12th arrondissement neighborhood between the Bastille and the Gare De Lyon. I buffed up my French, eked out a living writing and leading walking tours, and frittered away many a glorious day in open-air markets, museums, and cafes. Then came a move to America after several years in France, and before I knew it, ten years had passed without a trip back to my favorite city. I decided that the time had come to rediscover Paris — and that my young daughter would make a perfect traveling companion. Not that Camille would be inclined to spend hours admiring Picassos or sampling French cuisine. Like many kids, she pooh-poohs art museums and “weird” food. Rather, her raison d’etre in Paris was to rocket to the top of the Eiffel Tower. So, with that in mind, we kissed Dad goodbye, reiterated cat-care instructions, and set out to spend two weeks in France.
My mission when traveling long distances with my daughter is to plan activities that she will look forward to, then have a backup in case Plan A unravels. During our first days in Paris, we stuck close to our flat in the 2nd arrondissement and saved exuberant excursions for the mornings, when we had more stamina. We began with a 10-minute walk to the Centre Georges Pompidou, also known as Beaubourg.
“Pompidou! Is there really someone named Pompidou?” giggled Camille, gaping at one of the three most widely visited cultural site in the France.
“Of course,” I replied. “Pompidou was a French president who liked modern art.”
“Is that modern art?” she gasped, staring at the tangle of pipes and tubes looming above our heads.
People flock to Beaubourg for various reasons–the mishmash of modern architecture, the dance and theatrical spaces, the cavernous modern art museum on the fourth floor–but foremost, it is a fine family venue. Admission is free for kids, and there is plenty of room to move around, with a stew of mimes, musicians, jugglers, and portrait artists to entertain everyone standing in line. Our favorite part of the visit, though, was the panoramic view from Pompidou’s glass escalator.
“There it is, Mom,” shouted Camille, spotting the Eiffel Tower.
“And over there is Notre Dame and Quasimodo’s bell tower,” I pointed out as I thought about lunch. Because of the time change, Camille and I always seemed to be hungry. Outside, we grabbed two seats at one of the creperies surrounding the Fontaine Stravinsky, which boasts an array of whimsical figures that spiral and spit water in the air.
Feeling very French, I ordered a salmon crepe for me and a sugar one for Camille.
“What’s that?” cried my daughter, glaring at the thin, speckled brown pancake being placed in front of her. “It’s not like the crepes we eat at home!”
“It’s a French buckwheat crepe from Brittany,” I explained.
“I don’t like it, Mom. It looks strange.”
In a city where food is art, eating would become our biggest challenge. A litany of complaints accompanied each meal: The cheese smelled like bad breath, the mustard was the wrong shade of yellow, and the crème fraÎche wasn’t real whipped cream.
“Eat,” I implored, sounding like my mother. “There is no better food on the planet than here.”
After the crepe meltdown, we agreed on a culinary compromise, starting with croissants and cocoa for breakfast. Two blocks from our flat, we hit the croissant jackpot on rue Montorgueil. This cobblestone lane is a quintessential slice of French life. Vendors proudly hawk pretty produce from wooden carts as Frenchmen, heads buried behind Le Monde, sip thimble-size cups of coffee at sidewalk cafes. The bonus on the block, though, is La Pâtissier Stohrer, the oldest family bakery in Paris, boasting crusty croissants that are considered by many the best in the city.
Lines! If the Guinness Book of Long Lines existed, the Eiffel Tour would top the chart. Rain or shine, there’s always a huge crowd winding around the tower.
“Achh,” I groaned the afternoon we visited, calculating the four-hour wait.
“Forget the elevator, Mom,” said Camille. “Let’s climb to the top. It’s a shorter line.”
It certainly was: Forty-five minutes later, we were on our way up the mighty monument. “Ooh la la, look at Paris!” I exclaimed as we arrived at the tower’s second tier, mercifully the maximum for climbers. Feeling giddy, we took turns taking pictures in every direction.
The next day, we set out to find what my hometown newspaper calls “the best crepes in Paris.” On rue Cler in the 7th arrondissement, we joined a gaggle of crepe aficionados and watched a monsieur drop dollops of ivory batter onto a grill. Thirty seconds later, he flipped the bubbling batter and slathered it with chocolate. “Now these are real crepes,” said Camille, licking her fingers.
To get around, we purchased a Paris Visite card for unlimited bus and metro travel. The metro sprints across Paris as quickly as one can take a shower, but with a drawback: It’s underground, passing below all the sights we came to Paris to see. So, we reserved the metro for night outings or when we were in a hurry and otherwise crisscrossed Paris on city buses.
In the five years I lived in the city, I managed to avoid the Bateaux Mouches, a one-hour boat excursion that glides through the Seine with an invisible guide who booms out information about historical sights over a loudspeaker. Camille couldn’t wait to board the boat with the rest of the romantics and tourists. Afterward, we agreed it’s the fastest and coolest way to see Paris.
Eight is a grand age for kids to discover the world. They’re not tied to a parent’s hip, and they make friends easily. They’re curious and energetic, and anything new is still cool. But that doesn’t mean every day is hunky dory, even in Paris. One big challenge I faced in traveling solo with my daughter was finding moments when we could each relax in our own way. After a week on the go, tempers frayed. I reigned in the sightseeing and changed tactics, letting Camille sleep late while I savored coffee on the balcony. We discovered small playgrounds filled with children. Ultimately, I indulged my daughter in some of my favorite French frivolities.
Our feet were first on the list. Finding the perfect pair of red tennis shoes on the rue de Rivoli swallowed a chunk of one day, so afterward we skipped lunch and ordered two banana splits in the first cafe we spied along the Seine. Our most exciting moments were similarly unexpected and often free: puppeteers and musicians performing on stone bridges, skateboard competitions near monuments, and watching the Eiffel Tower light up the night like a trillion twinkling stars. One afternoon, we peeked into the pyramid at the Louvre, made a wish, picnicked in the Jardin des Tuileries, rode the Ferris wheel there three times, and conked out by 9 p.m.
We reserved one day for a country outing and chose Monet’s gardens in Giverny, arriving before the crowds on an early train. We loved the lemon-colored lilies cloaking the ponds, the family photos inside Monet’s house, and the tiny tearoom in town.
Suddenly, our days in Paris were dwindling. Sitting along the Seine savoring mango ice cream cones, we mapped out our last adventure: the five-story museum of science and technology at La Villette, which houses a planetarium, greenhouse, submarine, Géode, and more hands-on treasures than we could possibly experience in a day. The fluorescent anatomy section, lighting up the circulatory system, was my favorite. Camille preferred broadcasting a weather report from the museum’s television studio. I found the old-fashioned waterwheel illustrating the relationship between energy and water clever, and Camille gave the greenhouse rave reviews.
On our last night in France, we donned snazzy duds and our new shoes, took the metro to the Left Bank, and devoured a pizza in an outdoor restaurant on Boulevard Saint Germain. We topped off the evening with dessert at Deux Magots, the famous cafe where Simone de Beauvoir and Sartre often sat. It was here that Camille made her confession: “I love Paris, Mom, and I’d love to come with you again. There’s just one problem said my bilingual daughter : I don’t think anyone here understands you, because you speak really bad French!”
“You’re kidding!” I said in my best French. C’est pas vrai!

A few years ago, sometime in late 2022, I moved to France. Paris, to be exact.
I had just been accepted into the American University of Paris. The pandemic was winding down finally, the world was opening up and I decided that I wanted to take a leap of faith and move abroad for a few years.
Like a lot of young Americans, I was deeply convinced that life in Europe — France, to be exact — was going to be a better experience for me than back home. Looking back now I can see my naïvety from a mile away but, to be fair, I had been raised on years of positive, effusive press which often overlooks the dark side of living in Europe, the less-than-ideal reality of France, and my own family members’ longing(s) to escape the United States.
My first year or so in Paris were great, and fun. It was admittedly nice to be outside my comfort zone, in a place I wasn’t really all that familiar with, in a city I had only ever vacationed in. But as I began to “settle” into the city, I felt this lingering sense of discomfort start crawling over me. My first Parisian apartment, in the 7th, so close to the Eiffel Tower I could practically see it from my window, started to feel like an isolating prison. I felt frustrated, depressed, and mind-numbingly bored, but I wasn’t entirely sure if it was just stress from my studies or something else coming up to the surface. I think in many ways I was afraid to acknowledge the truth.
Then my mother died unexpectedly from cancer in the spring of 2024 and my life changed overnight. Home in the States for a few months dealing with her affairs, I had a lot of time to think about my life so far and whether or not I was truly following the right path.
The answer to that was a very resounding NO.
So, I made the painful but necessary decision to move back home, back to the United States, back where I really belong.
France was an okay experience, but it was not really all that people crack it up to be. There was only so much of France and Europe I think one can take before you eventually want to melt into a puddle, cease existing. I tried so hard to “fit into” a culture that would never accept me, never see me for who I really was, that inevitably I was beginning to crack and fall apart. And I tried, very hard, even after my mom died to make it work, but one day I woke up and realized I couldn’t do it anymore. I had to leave, go home, and put my life back together correctly.
Paris is beautiful, yes, but its beauty is, I came to realize, a kind of stifling and suffocating, pretentious, superficiality. When you first move here, it’s glorious to see old Haussmanian apartments towering above you, all in various shades of black and gray, especially when coming from American suburbia. But eventually, you start to notice the decay and depressive energy emanating from these blocks of grubby cement and stone — you see greenish mildew oozing from cracks in buildings, French doors moldering in the corners, rust chewing away at the fancy black banisters. Walking along the wide boulevards is both a dream and a nightmare, because the moment you turn down a corner you inevitably spend the majority of your time hopscotching over poopy pies (most canine but not all), puddles of fresh stinking ochre urine, and other nasty icky things like discarded underwear and who knows what else.
The food here eventually began to drive me crazy. Repetitive, bland, and boring, I began to crave, desperately, a plate of sizzling hot Thai stir fry with basil and chilis and onions and garlic. Or a delicious juicy burger with beef that tastes sweetly of grass and sunshine and not sweat and ammonia, melting in your mouth as opposed to becoming a chewy, grainy mess between your teeth. I missed the variety of produce and snacks at my local Albertsons grocery store, apples like jewels and luscious greens just beckoning to be chopped into stew, being able to make pretty much any dish I could possible think of without having to run around half of Paris to find a tiny bit of garam masala. And don’t even get me started on things like pickles. What do the French have against salty, crunchy, vinegary pickles? I hate those little petite cornichons with their mushy texture and sickly sweet aroma. Of course I could make them, as my grandmother showed me how well enough, but in my middling Parisian kitchen, it was hard to find space to fit a jar of cucumbers, mellowing away in their salted brine, amongst all the other shit I inevitably accumulated. It’s not a crime to want for convenience or simplicity; sometimes, all I wanted was to come home after a long day of classes, papers, and exams to a simple and delicious meal without feeling like I was trapped between McDonald’s and pasta in my choices.
And every time I left Paris for more than a month, I would come back feeling as though the city somehow became a little worse off than before. A little poorer, darker, more negative, less appealing. I think Parisians would like to imagine themselves a living in a bustling metropolis, à la New York, which I find laughable having recently been in NYC myself. Paris is nothing like New York, or London, or even Tokyo or Shanghai or Los Angeles. Even fucking Toronto is more interesting than Paris.
Paris is, at best, a glorified village — it has all the feelings of one, too. Twee and pretentious and conservative in all the wrong ways, clinging to traditions that no one cares about, turning its nose up at innovation and change as though its a crime to experiment and be creative. I found it ironic that in New York, I felt as though I could breathe. Not necessarily because the air was better, but simply because I felt like I could just be myself. No stares as I went about my day alone as apparently, being a single woman without a man or a friend in tow is somehow scandalous (who knew). No funny looks when wearing something other than the usual scarf + nappy old coat combo (the horror). Not having to glower at people over my shoulder as they clip my heels walking at super-sonic speeds down narrow and uneven streets, all to inevitably turn into a smoke shop or some coffeehouse to stand around and do nothing. Not feeling as though I need to explain, or justify my existence to anyone, or anything.
Plus, I’ve had some pretty hair-raising experiences in regards to crime and general grubby, scummy behavior that have made simple things like getting a taxi or even walking down the street more anxiety inducing than I think they need be. Of course we should always practice vigilance wherever we go, but I think when it gets to point you always feel a kind of simmering nervousness about innocent people walking behind you or second-guessing whether or not your taxi driver might pull a fast one on you, something is obviously wrong. Tourists and locals laugh off the crime (and its increase) as though it was funny and quirky but deep down, again, everyone knows it’s not a good sign. Not just now but of the state of things to come.
I haven’t even touched on the racism, the prejudices you inevitably run into, the rampant xenophobia, particularly towards Americans, which begins to weigh on your psyche. As expats/immigrants, we’re given a litany of things (literally! my university would often send lists out) we can’t do in Paris, or else. You try your very best to “fit in” and assimilate, but eventually it gets to the point where you’re just dimming your light to satisfy someone else’s mediocrity, and it actually made me angry a little. Why does everyone need to conform, go along with the crowd, not stand out, not be an individual? Have an opinion that isn’t like Jacques or Emilie’s, which also happens to be the same opinion of nearly every other person you meet? Why is it a crime to smile widely, laugh heartily, or feel passionately? I am not interested in living life in muted sepia tones all day every day, sorry! And trying to make connections with other expats was a nightmare in and of itself: I could never accept the habitual mistreatment, backhanded comments, two faced behavior, cattiness, and other bull that many American expats often put up with just to be accepted by Parisians and, in general, the French and many other Europeans. After about the second time of some random nobody making incredibly offensive and often racist personal digs at me, my intelligence, or my appearance, I had to call it quits.
I could go on, but the gist of things is…I eventually came to appreciate America more than I did when I first left. I missed all the wonderful things about this country we take for granted — our humor, our food, our culture, our nature, everything. I missed the deep, deep blue skies of California, the diversity of cities like New York and Los Angeles, the beauty of states such as Wyoming or Montana. I missed the smell of the desert and the sea mingling in the air in downtown LA, the sweet humid perfume of the bayou in deep country Louisiana where my relatives live. I even missed our shitty politicians, our goofiness, our earnestness. I missed it all, so, so much, in a way that it was almost like a hunger. I longed for all those experiences, the history, and my connection it. I realized I was fine with being “American”, and all the good and bad connotations that come along with it. I don’t have time or the energy anymore after my mom’s death to care so much about putting on airs or trying to pretend to be something I am not. Take it or leave it, it’s who I am and will always be.
Of course it took me running away for a while to see it again.

After planning the trip for over a year, we were finally here. Our bags having been dropped off at the hotel, my wife, Sarah, and I were on a walk through Les Marais in Paris. Yes, that’s Paris, France. I had to remind myself a couple of times on this first walk just to be sure.
Then we turned a corner and the Seine itself coursed away in front of us. Notre Dame stretched to the sky and its glory was somehow undimmed by the scaffolding that has adorned it since the fateful fire in 2019. Then finally, after walking a few miles, grabbing dinner, and taking an Uber when our legs wouldn’t carry us one step further, we saw the Eiffel Tower. We were here.
That split second of traveler euphoria was quickly squelched as — no more than a minute after we had stepped out of the Uber — the rain started. It was slow at first. Sun was even breaking through and splashing over the famous curved iron. But then the rains really came.
We tried to hail an Uber, but none were available — probably because we were now part of a growing throng of people huddled underneath the measly branches of landscaped trees near the queue for the Tower. We looked at each other through rain-soaked eyelashes; our clothes were drenched.

I was 32 years old when I got the email that brought me to France. By then the course of my life looked pretty much circumscribed. Like many English people I spoke no foreign languages, and there was little to indicate that I would one day live abroad, apart from a taste for subtitled films, croissants and novels in translation.
Weekday mornings I took the Tube to my mildly enjoyable job at an advertising trade magazine, picking up a copy of The Times to read along the way. At weekends I ate pub lunches and ambled in the park and spent hours buried in the Sunday papers, just like everyone else. True, I travelled quite a bit — but nobody asked me to stay.
Then it came, out of the blue. A mail from somebody called François. I wish I’d kept it — but no. Still, the essence of it was: “We’re launching an English-language magazine in Paris and we’re looking for an editor. Your name has come up. Interested?”
Long story short, I moved to Paris.
I arrived on the day before my birthday, so the date is easy to remember. Today, the day I’m writing this post, marks my 20th year here. And I can tell you, it’s gone by in a flash. Yet so much has happened: love, marriage, a son, changes of address and changes of fortune.
But that’s not why you’re here. What you want to know is: how does living abroad for so long change you as a person?
In essence, I think, you keep the best of your homeland and jettison the rest. And you’re also free to adopt the most appealing aspects of your new home and pretty much ignore everything else.
Becoming Franglais
Let’s start with England. I kept the sense of humour — that was a given. I also retain an old-fashioned sense of courtesy. I’m chatty yet respectful with waiters, taxi drivers, store security guards, shop assistants…everyone, in fact. My (French) wife often remarks on how polite I am on public transport — not a very Parisian characteristic. My colleagues tell me I’m “a gentleman”. But this comes with a wariness of causing offence that can prevent me from speaking my mind — something my wife feels is tantamount to hypocrisy. “Is that your real answer?” she’ll say, after asking my opinion. “Or your English answer?”
I kept a whole roster of English-language films and books and poems that remain dear to me. And I still don’t mind the rain.
I lost my patriotism. I was never xenophobic, but learning another language has definitely made me more open. I recall stating quite often that London was the greatest city in the world, but I’ve revised that opinion. We all know where the “Britain is best” attitude led. Living in France has enabled me to understand the cultural jigsaw puzzle of Europe and see Britain’s place in it. When that piece went missing, I was appalled.
Yet at the same time, I wasn’t entirely surprised. There is a yobbish, jingoistic subculture in the UK that has always scared and disgusted me. Those groups of drunken young men stumbling around town on Saturday nights. I was delighted to leave them behind. Along with football. “Soccer”, if you prefer. The first conversational gambit of almost every British male. No, I don’t support a team. No, I didn’t see the match. And no, I’m really not interested in talking about it.
Food, now that’s interesting. It doesn’t take a French person long to get onto the subject — and I’ve become like them. I can hold my own on the wine front, too. In fact I’ve become addicted to bistros and brasseries, and a basket of bread with every meal.
But there’s also a particular sort of family meal here. It’s long and garrulous, with many courses and lots of debate, some of it heated. After my first dinner with my now-wife’s family, I asked her in amazement: “Do you always speak to your parents like that?”
Living in France has taught me a different way of being a family member. Be close. Be present. Show affection. We have dinner with Géraldine’s parents every Saturday — something I would never have imagined doing with my own parents, still less my partner’s.
Joie de vivre, actually
I’ve developed a different relationship to work and money. Back in London, people worked hard. They arrived at work early, they grafted, their lunch was often a sandwich at their desk. I respected them for that. Living in London is expensive, and you have to earn your keep. You can always de-stress in the pub at night.
In Paris it’s different. It irritated me at first. In my neighbourhood I’d try to go to the bank and the dry cleaner at lunchtime — and they were shut. The sandwiches on sale in supermarkets and even boulangeries were surprisingly bland: there’s only so much ham and cheese you can eat. The restaurants and the café terraces, on the other hand, were packed. What was it with these people? Didn’t they have work to do?
Yes, they did. But they also had lives to live. Friends to see. Small pleasures to enjoy. In general — and I’ve just checked this with my wife — French people are suspicious of the rich and bemused by workaholics. They are not lazy. But they don’t put work and money at the centre of their lives. One day, I got that. So instead of complaining, I decided to try their approach. The next day I was sitting on a café terrace at lunchtime, eating fillet of salmon with ratatouille and sipping a glass of rosé. I returned to work happy and motivated. I’m sorry, but the French have totally won lunchtime.
Emotionally, as well, I’ve become a little more French. I’m less afraid to show sadness, or anger — or even, indeed, fear. I’m no longer convinced that a stiff upper lip is the best expression to adopt.
I’ve also come to understand the concept of loyalty, which felt somewhat abstract back home. French people don’t have the easy familiarity of Americans, or the chirpy amiability of Brits, but once they decide that you’re a friend, they’re in it for life. Restaurants here work in a similar way, oddly enough. You know that waiter you considered aloof and cold? Go back the next night. Then the night after that. He’ll soon warm up. There are restaurants in Paris where I’m practically welcomed with open arms. Because I showed loyalty.
Paris, of course, is all about style. My wife thinks my personal style comes from England, as it leans heavily into tweed jackets or blazers, shirts with cufflinks and well-polished brogues. But the truth is that being an Englishman in Paris has accentuated that style. Paris gave me the urge to dress up — England gave me the building blocks. Plus in summer I love a stripy mariner’s T-shirt, which is totally français.
Talking of birthdays, there’s one thing I do that my wife tells me is very English. I send cards. Birthday, Christmas, Valentine’s…you name it. I take pride in selecting the prettiest ones. But they’re not so easy to find here, so I stock up when I’m in London.
Perhaps, in the end, that’s why I chose to settle in Paris. Culturally, it’s very different to the UK. But it’s also only a two and a half hours away by Eurostar. I really can have the best of both worlds.

(Originally written in January, 2021)
In Netflix’s new show Emily in Paris, a young woman moves to Paris from Chicago to work at a fashion PR firm and finds success leveraging experiential and influencer campaigns for her clients. As I binge watched the first season, I couldn’t help but notice how non-traditional marketing ideas were central to the storylines. While the show exaggerates reality a lot, it also makes a statement about marketing and advertising; experiential and influencer marketing tactics are the most effective ways for brands to authentically connect with audiences. Below are some of the most memorable examples of non-traditional marketing from the first season of Emily in Paris, along with some relevant real world examples for reference.
Interactive Installations (Episode 5)
In this episode, Emily’s boss Sylvie makes a pitch to Hästens, a Swedish luxury bed company, but the client is not impressed with her traditional marketing idea. Emily then pitches her idea for an interactive campaign showing the beds at well-known Paris locations. The client likes her idea and Emily to activates a “social media installation” at La Place Dalida, placing the bed on the street for audiences to engage with and share on their social channels. Emily’s idea is reminiscent of one of my favorite IKEA activations from back in 2013 when the brand turned billboards into real bathrooms, complete with actors brushing their teeth and styling their hair at Paris’ Saint Lazare train station. You can read about it in this article on The Drum.
Introducing Brand Rituals (Episode 8)
In this episode Emily’s friend Mindy has friends visiting from China. When they are out partying, they celebrate by spraying each other with expensive champagne. Emily is inspired and, when she has the opportunity to pitch a potential new vineyard client, suggests they create a new ritual with their surplus of champaign. Her idea is that the vineyard should create a sub brand of Champagne that is exclusively promoted for spraying and can become the “Spray of Paris.” Emily’s idea of a brand creating or endorsing a ritual around their products has proven to be effective popularized by the Ice Bucket Challenge to promote awareness for ALS. Similarly Getting Iced is a ritual created to encourage drinking Smirnoff Ice.
Guerrilla PR Stunts (Episodes 9 and 10)
In episode 9, two avante-garde fashion designers who go by the name Grey Space show up to the AFL auction to bid on a dress that Emily is modeling. They proceed to pull off a publicity stunt by shooting her with paint and shocking the audience in the middle of the show. This concept is reminiscent of Banksy’s self shredding artwork at Sotheby’s last year, and shows the strength of leveraging a live stunt to generate press and talk value.
In episode 10, Pierre returns the favor to Grey Space by creating a PR stunt of his own, hijacking the outside of his former venue and presenting his new collection directly on the street in the middle of a crowd. The audience loves it, and his disruptive stunt goes viral making him the toast of Fashion Week. Pierre’s approach in this episode is reminiscent of more immersive fashion shows that have become popular over the past few years and demonstrate how more experiential and non-traditional approaches to presenting fashion are generating buzz, creating more press and translating to sales.
As the examples above indicate, Emily works with brands to tell creative stories through stunts and real world experiences that invite participation, feel culturally authentic and generate social media shares. If Emily in Paris is any indication of how Gen Z wants to be marketed to, brands should take note and put a bigger emphasis on non traditional marketing campaigns and projects in the coming year.

If Paris is the City of Light, it’s also the city of dog poop.
Anywhere you go, on any street, in any quarter, you’ll be greeted by the familiar sight of a dog’s breakfast. Or at least what remains of it.
Make no mistake: Paris is a fecal minefield. And it always has been.
In a city known for its refinement, you could argue that the dog poop here is made to perfection — so much so that canine excrement from other cities is a distant no. 2.
Because here, every dog poop is the product of hours of French savoir-faire in the art of dégustation, digestion and excretion — a celebration of craft that brings the community together. After all, the best way to give a merde about society is by leaving one behind.
So to celebrate Parisian solidarity, I thought it would be interesting to document the sheer variety of dog poop in Paris, before these most humble of creations go the way of the dinosaurs.
It’s a truism that dogs are allowed to poop next to trees. At least then, people can avoid tarnishing their soles with a stranger’s gift. But what happens when this gift isn’t gifted in the streets’ litter…

What Parisians can teach us about shaking up our morning routine.
“If you think adventure is dangerous, try routine; it is lethal.” — Paulo Coelho
Once upon a time, I was sitting inside a bar in the East Village of Manhattan with some NYU friends for happy hour. It was a rare occasion that we exited Bobst Library in time for after-work specials. Our conversation was in full swing, high-antioxidant wine was flowing, and of course, some bites graced the table. I cannot pinpoint the exact topic of the conversation, but I will forever remember the statement my fellow peer and dear friend made to this day — “Sometimes I feel like I am stuck between wanting a structured life and wanting to be a Bohemian.”
It was like time slowed down, the music blurred, the camera did that thing where it spins around you catching every angle of your body and intensifying your emotions. That’s it! That’s exactly how I feel! I thought to myself. On second thought, maybe I said it out loud. I carried on with my pumpkin soup and glass of red, and my life was forever changed.
Very nutrition student of you…
Walking the walk, you know.
For the rest of my life, I would continue with some sort of routine, but when it got too strict, too structured, too “routiney,” I would let my Bohemian side come out to play.
I am not here to tell you how Elon, Richard, Serena, or Beyoncé spend their mornings and then proceed to tell you to follow suit. I have said this before, and I will say it again, “what works for one person does not mean it works for everyone,” and other short stories by yours truly.
OK, Kelly so what are you here for then? Hurry up because I only have 8 more minutes to meditate, take a cold shower, and make my bone marrow coffee before I go to work. FML.
I am here to tell you that maybe the best morning routine allows for some wiggle room to shake things up once in a while. I’m not talking about an adrenaline-seeking, risk-taking, edge-of-your-seat, “Vegas, baby!” shaking up. I’m talking about instead of driving to work or taking the train, walking or biking; instead of gulping down drip coffee sipping on a Chai, or instead of meditating followed by journaling, reading a chapter in that book you have had on your nightstand for the past month.
2 months, actually.
I appreciate the honesty.
You have your habits, your rituals, and your overall routine, and you like it, but you cannot handle it when it doesn’t go exactly to plan. Your heart thumps and your nerves move to the edge of your skin wanting an out, how dare someone get sick on the train and make me late for my panda-hugging class! Maybe that morning routine needs a vacation, or maybe it just needs a good cry.
You aren’t talking about my routine anymore, are you…?
You do not need to have a ridged morning routine 7 days a week to be successful. Each day may be different and some people love plans and routines while others do not. Sometimes a morning routine is a product of your personality and sometimes it is a product of your environment, life situation, or culture.
For years I have loved to have some sort of morning routine. It has shifted and changed a bit from time to time. When I moved from NYC to Paris the change in my morning routine was mainly because of the change in my environment, work, and life situation. While NYC and Paris have some similarities (the metro is packed like sardines in both cities), they also have a lot of differences, and one difference that stood out to me was the morning routine of the people of Paris.
Let’s go back to New York first.
“I gotta go schlepp uptown.”
“Can’t gotta work.”
“See you at the gym at 6 AM?”
“I’ll have a quadruple espresso, please.” (I’m not exaggerating; I heard it for myself, Wall Street, 2015).
“I’m getting on this train whether these people think I am or not.” (The train stalls after getting on).
“I think a rat just ran over my foot.”
“Walk faster.”
God, I love New York!
Is this nostalgic for some of you? Above are snippets of New Yorkers’ conversations, either with another person or with themselves. For some of you, moments like these are a distant memory. Now you wake up, roll out of bed, move your computer’s mouse around, and put on the Pivot Podcast while you shower.
My New York mornings were calculated as they involved taking the 6 train from the Upper East Side to Wall Street. I wakeup, caffeine in the form of black coffee or Matcha, brush my teeth, put cold water on my face, exercise, shower, skincare, mascara, under-eye concealer, lipstick, pinch cheeks, and delete those text messages from the night before because “out of sight out of mind,” grab my breakfast to have at work and do an Olympic power walk to the train. Once at work, I would check my emails while eating breakfast. Boom- chakalaka. I was high off “the hustle.”
Once back to work, I fell slightly back into calculating my mornings. It was like riding a bike, once learned and never forgotten. A couple of days a week I taught Pilates at 7 AM. I would wake up giving myself exactly 60 minutes to brush my teeth, wash my face, dab on some tinted face cream and under-eye concealer, chug cold brew, walk to work, and eat breakfast in the bathroom 5 minutes before teaching so I would not pass out from low blood sugar, and by that time the cold brew kicked in the city was the best place on earth. My 7 AM clients got the best of me.
On the other mornings, I worked from home. I still woke up fairly early to get in some morning movement before work. My weekends, both pre and post-pandemic, were quite different, but not drastically different, and I wanted them that way. My weekends were like my adventure not to make my routine lethal. But why did I have to leave all of that up to the weekend?
Let me guess. Society? Culture?
It is quite likely that they tested the workweek waters. I was just thinking out loud.
To summarize and generalize, mornings in New York are:
wake and Drake before 7 AMcover the dark circles under your eyesbrush and rushget coffee and something to eat on the gomiss your train by .7 secondsgrab the next one right behind itsit on the train because of train trafficget off the train|confirm dinner date plans while walking to the officepush the arrow up buttonface your childhood fear of elevatorsthrow all of your worries behind as you enter the office with a smile on your face.
Usually every night I take a walk to the steps of the church of Saint-Etienne-du-Mont. Then at the stroke of midnight, a car full of drunk characters that look like they came from a Great Gatsby party pulled up to whisk me away to a literary joint for champagne and storytelling.
Wow, there must be something in the champagne over there…
Good one. This is not a true event, but can’t we all just take a moment to appreciate Midnight in Paris? Merci Beaucoup.
Now for the real Paris life. No, I did not eat croissants every morning or have a cigarette on the balcony overlooking the Parisian architecture as the sun rose. Although, in honesty, I very easily could have. Paris is filled with the smell of freshly baked bread and pastries (and cigarette smoke), and you do not have to pay a fortune to have a balcony as part of the apartment package.
I still had structure even though my work was far less structured, and I still moved my body in the morning doing some sort of exercise even though Paris is not a culture of morning structured workouts. Take my neighbor Camille for example, she got in her morning movement by biking to work, and in heels (I know this because I could hear it through our old, charming Parisian walls).
My mornings in Paris were much, well slower. I would open the shutters, go out on the balcony (I know New Yorker, keep manifesting, and until then enjoy the fire escape), take a deep breath, use the bathroom, mist my face with Evian water (stop judging, I live in France, remember), prepare coffee (no longer cold brew), and breakfast, conduct a mini skincare routine, move my body and eat breakfast at a real-life table. But this post is not to tell you all about what I did and I do. I am still an American after all. What have I observed about real-life Parisians? Read on.
Let’s paint the picture. Typically the Parisian will wake up early unless they are an artist or such, then whatever, c’est la vie! Coffee is a must, and those who choose tea are not condemned for choosing the other liquid cocaine. Coffee is typically not hyper-caffeinated cold brew, although the hipsters have imported that to town so do not be surprised if you see it on the menu. Classic coffee choices range from café allongé (the French Americano, with less water), café au lait (coffee with milk), cappuccino, or a café latte. At breakfast, and only at breakfast, a traditional French thing to do is to have your morning brew in a mug that is more like a bowl (think big enough to comfortably dip a croissant or piece of baguette into your warm frothy milk coffee). If you have never dipped a croissant or piece of baguette into your cappuccino I highly recommend you give it a try. Dietitian approved.
Food Nerd alert.
Why, thank you.
Commonly at brasseries, they will offer a petit-déjeuner (breakfast) menu of a hot drink (coffee, tea, or hot chocolate), cold drink (typically orange juice), tartine (usually baguette) with butter and jam, or viennoiserie (a pastry such as a croissant or pain au chocolat- a chocolate croissant). At home, the classic petit-déjeuner meal is similar, or other more modern-day options are to have yogurt, some fruit, or cereal. But bread is always a good idea in Paris.
Paris also serves the global masses, and brunch or a wider variety of breakfast foods are offered at some cafes and restaurants for tourists or homesick expats.
One of the places that I loved visiting in Paris was the pharmacy. I know what you are thinking, weirdo, but hear me, or read me, out. The pharmacies here just hit differently. When I first moved to Paris I thought, Ooooh lala look at all of these French brands, SVR Laboratories, Bioderma, and Embryolisse, oh my! Then I remembered, oh yeah, I’m in France, this is just the norm. The morning skincare routine offers more variety for the skin to devour than the French breakfast, but it is just as simple and enjoyable. Customarily speaking, micellar water or cleansing milk is used to cleanse the skin followed by a toner such as rosewater, a dab of eye cream, a serum, and a moisturizer, likely with SPF. Exfoliation products are used, but less often, and are very gentle. Voila.
Parisians are generally not going to get up and hit the gym early in the morning. My schedule for teaching Pilates completely changed when I moved to Paris. No more chug and teach.
I cannot find a yoga class before 11 AM and the only dance class I can find before 10 am is on Saturdays. I’m not saying they don’t exist, but they are not in demand.
What are they doing if they are not hitting the gym? Well, not rushing through their morning coffee or breakfast for one. My husband gets up about 1.5 hours before he leaves for work to sit and drink his coffee, read sports news, eat something small, and take a long shower. I witnessed one gym during my time in Paris, but mostly I see people biking, jogging, or walking outside a lot.
Parisians love to be outside (some people say so they can smoke la cigarette), but they also are more likely to, say, jog outside than jog on a treadmill inside. The same goes for biking. The morning commute is a typical way for Parisians to get in movement and to get outside. Just beware of the bikes.
I am always amazed by the difference in the sun while in different parts of the world. In Dubai, it looks bigger, like it is staring at you in your face, demanding attention. In Paris, it shines later into the night during the Summer months, until about 10:30 PM, and the sunrise shifts as well. I remember waking up at our apartment in November thinking it was probably 5 AM because it was still so dark outside. It was 8 AM.
Paris offers you a view from a different angle of the morning routine. I hope this peek into Parisian life may inspire you to add a petite adventure to your morning routine. You do not have to jump on a plane and arrive here by morning to live a little Parisian. Remember, trains stall here too, so bring a good book with you and bof it off.
I think that often many of us (moi-self included) romanticize Paris. Now that I write this I think Americans romanticize all of Europe in general. You may have heard that saying before “Europeans go to America to work, Americans go to Europe to live.” Perhaps that came from the history of immigration to the US for the “American Dream,” back in the day when people from all over Europe entered the East Coast of America by boat to start a new life and a new business. When they went back home to Europe they could finally relax a little. Whatever the reason may be sometimes it feels good to fantasize about a place far, far away.
Which brings me back to that one night in New York. I had a vision of myself at the intersection between Orderly Avenue and rue de Nonconformist; one of those hallucinations that are so real that if it didn’t happen in real life you are going to make it happen in real life. I have revisited the saying “structured bohemian,” in my mind multiple times since that evening. I relate well to opposites — organized chaos, imperfect symmetry, the sun and the moon, not one or the other. I am the equivalent of both. The same went for a routine. Too much I felt stagnant. Too little I felt unsteady. I craved balance. But balance isn’t frigid. It is room temperature, flowing, swaying, and calm.
French icon Coco Chanel once said, “You were born an original, don’t become a copy !”
I think this is helpful when thinking about a morning routine. There is a difference between being inspired by someone and being influenced by someone. I provide examples of my personal morning routines and that of some Parisians, but the last thing I want is for one to feel pressured into copying another culture or particular person’s routine. The meaning behind this message is to help you notice when you are being too strict with yourself and also to be aware when something calls to you. If you would rather sleep a little more in the morning than wake up and journal, then let sleep be your meditation. If you have more energy in the morning then be inspired by some morning movement.
Finally, allow yourself to change. I can say with absolute assurance my morning routine now is not the same as it was when I was 25 years old. If you are overloading your morning with all the trends from all the cultures and all the people are you honoring your own needs? Your wants? Permit yourself to let your inner Bohemian come out to play.

As a guide, the tourists and visitors, French or foreigners, that I guide ask me what to do in Paris, apart from the (too) famous Louvre and Montmartre district. They ask me what are my favourite places in Paris, what are the nice, cheap and tourist-free places where you can enjoy the city.
During my wanderings in the streets of Paris, I have collected little tips and cultural, artistic, and natural activities, totally free to do in the French capital. All you have to do is pick from this list and enjoy your moment without spending a penny. Ready to go?
If you have been reading me for some time, you must know my passion for modern art. I may be overdoing it BUT I have to admit that it is the best period in art history. Well, you know what, it is possible to enjoy modern art in Paris completely free of charge, with a view of the Eiffel Tower to boot. The Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, commonly known as MAM, is an artistic showcase in the heart of a pompous corner of the capital, a stone’s throw from the Eiffel Tower. What’s more, the entire display was redone a few months…

Paris, the City of Lights, is renowned worldwide for its rich culture and sophistication. It is famous for its world-class art museums like the Louvre and the Musée d’Orsay, iconic Hausmannian architecture, and manicured gardens like the Jardin des Tuileries and the Jardin du Luxembourg. Fashion, gastronomy, and fine wines are celebrated features of Parisian life.
Paris has also been a hub for major artistic and philosophical movements throughout history. Impressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism found fertile ground here, while the Age of Enlightenment and modern philosophy flourished amidst the city’s intellectual vibrancy. There is a lot to see and do in Paris, and it is one of the most visited cities in the world.
I was ecstatic when my family relocated to Paris in the summer of 2022. The City of Lights has long captivated my imagination, and moving there was a dream come true for me and my husband in many ways. We settled in our new neighborhood, with the Eiffel Tower, affectionately known as The Iron Lady — -standing nearby. We delighted in the perfectly cooked baguettes, delectable cheese, and flaky viennoiseries and tried the traiteurs and restaurants nearby. My daughter loved discovering all the whimsical carousels scattered throughout the city. We walked along the Seine at night, significantly cooling during the warm summer nights. I visited multiple exhibits and discovered artists I had never known. The city’s offering of Classical music concerts allowed me to deepen my appreciation for Bach and Vivaldi, among many others.
Living in Paris has refined my senses. I now have an eye for Western art, an ear for classical music, a refined palate, and a newfound appreciation for architectural grandeur. I have always loved nature and did not think a condensed city would be as magnificent as it would be. But I was wrong. Paris breathed beauty, and I inhaled its beauty.
Beyond its renowned culture and sophistication, Paris unexpectedly unveiled a mystical dimension. It was mystical in that when I visited certain places (other places I will discuss in later blogs), I felt a stronger connection to the Divine, the universe, or, as some would say, God. I was filled with the same awe that had gripped me while walking amongst the Redwoods in California, exploring Sedona’s red canyons, and watching the sunset on a Hawaiian beach.
This mystical energy became clearer as I uncovered the history of Paris. Around the 3rd century BC, the Parisii, a Celtic sub-tribe of the Senones, settled along the Seine River. The Parisii were one of the many Celtic tribes that made up the larger population of Gauls. The Gauls inhabited much of western Europe during the Iron Age and the Roman Age (5th century BC to 5th century AD), including modern-day France, Belgium, Switzerland, parts of Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic. They did not have a unified government or leadership but were composed of many tribes who could unite for large-scale military operations. They were known for their warrior culture and artistic achievements, such as metalwork, jewelry, and pottery. They built bridges and a fort, minted coins, and traded with other European riverine settlements.
The Gauls believed in many Gods and Goddesses. Their religion was deeply connected to nature, with spirits believed to inhabit forests, rivers, and other natural features. Druids, highly educated individuals with extensive knowledge of religion, law, medicine, astronomy, and other subjects, acted as religious leaders, teachers, and advisors in their community.
Based on etymological interpretations, Druids translates to the “oak-knower” or “knowing the oak tree.” Little is known about what the Druids were really like, and the recorded history written about them is from Roman accounts, which may not always be entirely accurate or objective. Some scholars believe women may have also played important roles within Druidic traditions, possibly as priestesses, healers, or teachers. Julius Caesar provides the most well-known Roman account of the Druids in his book “Commentarii de Bello Gallico (“Commentaries on the Gallic War”).
Here is what was included in his description:
However, the Roman conquest of Gaul, which included the area of Paris, and the arrival of Christianity led to the suppression of Druidic practices. In 52 BC, the Romans conquered the Parisii and established the Gallo-Roman town of Lutetia on the central island of Paris, where the Parisii settled. Christianity took root in Lutetia during the 3rd century AD.
After the fall of the Roman Empire, Clovis I, the King of the Franks, seized control of the city and designated it as the capital of his kingdom. This began Paris’ importance as a European political and cultural center.
Fast forward to the modern day, I was surprised to see Paris’ Celtic history represented at the Opening Ceremony for the 2024 Summer Olympics. As part of the program, a mechanical metallic horse carrying the Olympic flag galloped through the Seine with a rider wearing a metal suit. It was captivating and left a lasting impression on me. I wanted to learn about the symbolism, and I discovered that the horse and the rider symbolized not only the Olympic spirit of resilience, peace, solidarity, and unity but also the goddess Sequana, a revered deity in Gallic mythology.
Information about the Goddess Sequana is derived from excavations performed at her sanctuary located at the principal source of the Seine River called the Fontes Sequanae, near Châtillon-sur-Seine in the Burgundy region of France. In the mid-18th century, archaeologists discovered the foundations of a massive rectangular building (57 meters by 18 meters) within a valley near the source of the Seine River, with an inscription that read “DEA SEQUANA,” identifying the site as a sanctuary dedicated to the goddess Sequana. In 1933, renowned artist Henri Corot made a significant discovery: the bronze statue of the goddess Seine was found near a faun statue.
Archaeological excavations in 1863–1967 confirmed that this was once a pilgrimage site for devotees. Excavations yielded an impressive collection of roughly 1,500 votive offerings crafted from stone, bronze, and wood. The offerings contained specific body parts — eyes, limbs, sexual organs, and even internal organs — suggesting that the pilgrims must have sought the goddess’s divine intervention to heal ailments represented by the body parts. Sculptures often depicted pilgrims presenting gifts to the goddess, such as money, fruit, or their cherished pets — dogs and birds. Despite her Celtic origins, Sequana was eventually adopted into the broader framework of Gallo-Roman religious worship.
The Seine, a 485-mile (780-kilometer) river, flows northwest through the heart of Paris and empties into the English Channel at the Normandy coast. Lined with charming cafes and iconic landmarks, it is one of Paris’ major tourist attractions.
I love going for walks along the Seine. Sometimes, I find a bench or place along the quai and sit there awhile. I stare at its beauty as the sun dances on its surface, and in the evenings, I bask in its glory as the illuminated lights of the city shimmer and sparkle like stars in its waters. Then the world slows down, and the city’s frenetic pace fades into a distant hum as I go within to a place of stillness. I feel a sense of awe, a divine feminine energy surrounding me. Sequana, with her effortless grace, invites me to pause and simply be. She reminds me that amidst the chaos of city life, there is always a place for peace and serenity where my soul can find solace.
Living in Paris, I am slowly recreating the myth that connecting to the Divine in a big, condensed city is difficult. By uncovering Paris’ history and connecting to the beautiful myths of the people who once lived here, I, too, sense the magic they felt by the Seine River, the splendor of the Goddess Sequana.
Where do you live? Do you know your city’s history and myths? Do you have a place where you could be with yourself and simply BE?

Fans of the film Casablanca know that when Rick comforts Lisa he means people will always have memories of people and places and moments in time.
The thing is, Paris — partly thanks to such films as Casablanca, Midnight in Paris, and Forget Paris (and many others) — revels in its reputation as the City of Light, the City of Love, a city rich in history and literature.
Much of that reputation lies in layers of myth, as many visitors soon learn the minute they step into the Arrivals section at Charles De Gaulle (CDG) airport.
Paris is a big, noisy, and bustling city. No two ways about it.
Rose-colored glasses soon fall to the pavement. And tourists fall victim to “Paris Syndrome,” seeming similar to Stendahl Syndrome, a condition that visitors to Florence suffer from too much beauty. Yet there’s a difference, yes?
Regardless, I love Paris, with all its warts and issues.
Believe me, warts exist. Note that I have visited Paris at least twelve times, for varying lengths of time.
But it’s understandable how so many of the millions of yearly travelers fail to find the Paris of their dreams.
Take my most recent trip, in March/April 2023.
During the first week, I wound up dodging garbage piled HIGH, almost to American first-floor height.
Tourists crowded every nook and cranny near the city center, so much so I didn’t get inside my favorite bookstore at all: Shakespeare & Co.
Fortunately, I stayed in the relatively tourist-free 15th arrondissement, about four blocks from the Seine, south of the Eiffel Tower and Champs de Mars.
I also got a good taste of what the city is truly like near the Buttes Chaumont.
And, of course, driving from CDG to the center, you can’t miss the concrete block apartment buildings and the banlieues on the way into the city, including Drancy, of ill fame during WWII.
Speaking of the Champs de Mars brought back a memory, one that should have shredded any desire of mine to visit Paris ever again.
It’s one of my most memorable Parisian memories.
Early on a June morning, I left my closet-sized hotel room on the Avenue Emile Deschanel and started toward the Champs de Mars on my way to a two-week cooking class at the Cordon Bleu at its former Rue Léon Delhomme location, “Fish and Their Sauces.” Since it was June, and warm, it only felt right to wear sandals. I’d change into sturdier shoes once I opened my locker at the school. The chefs didn’t allow sandals in the kitchens. And with good reason, given the heavy pots and boiling liquids so easily dropped or spilled.
As usual, I focused my eyes on the architecture looming above me. Rounding a corner near the far end of the park, my right foot forward, I stepped into a steaming pile of fresh dog poop. Creamy, warm, and stinky.
As the feces — likely from one of the pampered poodles of ladies living in the Faubourg Saint Germain area — seeped between each of my five toes, I frantically searched through my purse for some Kleenex. I leaned up against a wall and scraped as much of the goop off as I could.
As I flew through the door at the Cordon Bleu, I barked a terse, de rigueur “Bon jour” to the receptionist and hurried downstairs to the locker room. I ripped off the sandal and thrust my filthy foot into one of the sinks, pumping the soap dispenser like a farmer milking a cow.
With a half dozen paper towels, I managed to dry my foot enough to pull on a sock and the required leather shoe suitable for the kitchen. The left foot, no problem.
As for my sandals, I would never be able to get the subtle stink of dog poop out of the leather straps. I wrapped both sandals in a plastic bag and shoved them into the trash bin. Then I finished dressing in the required uniform, necessary even for short-term students.
I bought another pair of shoes from a street vendor in Montmartre a few days later. However, I never wore sandals again in Paris during any of my many future visits to the city.
Despite efforts to eliminate the French dog poop problem, it persists.
What to do?
Don’t look up before you look down first!

In these times, when supply far exceeds demand, and everyone is creating for the sake of sharing and appreciation, it’s crucial to take a step back, close your eyes, and find new perspectives. Otherwise, you might just end up bored and disinterested, since what you’re doing has probably been done before.
The unpredictable nature of street photography can be liberating, but it can also present a fog of opportunities without clear direction. You wake up in the morning, not knowing what you’ll bring home, which is fine and wonderful. However, there are occasions when having clear guidelines helps, especially when you are in a not-so-familiar place but want to make the most of it.
Living in the Netherlands, reaching the “City of Light” takes about a five-hour drive in an electric car. I’ve visited Paris several times, but this year I combined a weekend of tourism with my passion for street photography. With limited time for both, I needed to be objective.
The solution? To participate in a photography competition with a triptych mindset.

Last year, I was in the mood to read the classics, so I picked up “A Moveable Feast” by Ernest Hemingway:
“A Moveable Feast” is a memoir and a sketchbook of the time when a young and poor Hemingway lived in Paris during the 1920s.
He was a foreign correspondent at the time, and his literary career was just beginning. I hadn’t read anything by Hemingway in many years, and picking up this book reminded me how much I like his writing style.
“A Moveable Feast” is a bit random, as you might expect from a diary-style narration.
Hemingway writes about his relationship with his first wife and the woman he cheated on her with, who later became his second wife (spoiler alert — he had four wives in total).
He also writes about his friendships within the American expat community in the 1920s Paris, including his relationship with Scott Fitzgerald and other writers and artists of that time (spoiler alert — Fitzgerald was an alcoholic).
The book has many interesting moments. For example, Hemingway writes about being poor and constantly hungry in Paris, which was especially hard with all the bakeries and restaurants on the Parisian streets. Apparently, this is why his novels and literary works have a bigger focus on food and drinks.
“A Moveable Feast” is, if I’m not mistaken, the author’s last published work. It’s definitely a good read, full of stories about Paris and getting drunk with famous artists.
Beer of the day is an easy choice — my favorite Blue Moon!
I do repeat this beer quite a lot here, but it always features different surroundings.
This picture is special as it was taken at one of the stalls during the 2024 Edinburgh Fringe festival.
It was our first time experiencing Fringe, and oh me oh my, what an experience! It was truly amazing, and felt like a month-long carnival. I definitely had a post-Fringe blues afterwards.

People will argue with me on this. For many, the race last weekend: Ronde van vlaanderen aka Tour of Flanders is the best race of the season. And indeed, in terms of spectator experience and in terms of cobbled climbs, which separate the gladiators from the men, climbs like the Paterberg, the bone shaking and long Kwaremont and the Koppenberg, it is indeed a great race to watch. Last weekend, it was the legendary Tadej Pogacar dropping his equally legendary rival, Matthieu Van Der Poel on the Kwaremont on their 3rd turn up the hill, to take his 2nd Tour of Flanders win.
But for me, the race that has always fascinated me, has had this weird combination of mystique and fear, has always left me romanticising about cycling is none other than the race I am watching while writing this blog: Paris-Roubaix, often known as the hell of the north.
A bit of cycling context, the most famous race on the cycling calendar is the Tour de France, which is a 3 week long stage race capturing the imagination of everyone who has ever ridden a bike. The stages spanning through beautiful French countrysides, ending in sprints, the battles on the slopes of the Pyrenees and the Alps, it is hard not be romantic about cycling. It evokes the primitive of emotions. It is poetry in motion. There are two other grand tours: Giro D’Italia and Vuelta d’Espana, both of whom hold less prestige than the Tour De France. These are the 3, 3 week stage races. There multiple 2 and 1 week stage races as well and then there are some famous one day races. Out of them, one of the key races has always been the Road World Championships which often happens at the end of the Vuelta, toward September. And then you have the 5 Classics:
If you were wondering if there are any other cyclists other than Pogacar and Van Der Poel, you can be excused. Out of the last 19 Classics, 14 have been won by these two. I am writing this part with 52.5 kilometers to go in today’s race and Pogacar, Van Der Poel and Jasper Philipsen (Winner of 2024 Milan San-Remo and Van Der Poel’s teammate) lead the race by 1'18"".
Simple reason: The drama. Take a look at this picture:
And this:
The start point of Paris-Roubaix is variable, for example, in 2025 it began in Compiègne (Which is a bit outside Paris). But it always end up in the Velodrome of Roubaix, where the riders do 750 meters and often end up in a sprint finish. In 2025, the distance of the race was 259.2 kilometers and it is often in that range and during these kilometers, the riders go through several cobbled sections.
These sections are hundreds of years old and are maintained by “Les amis des Paris-Roubaix”. This group of volunteers, founded by Jean-Claude Vallaeys in 1983 maintain the cobbled sections in their pristine state so that the racers have the same conditions of the cobbles every year. The cobbles, as I mentioned before are the main point of attraction of this race. The sections are graded with stars, with the 1 star sections being the “easiest” and the 5 star sections being the most challenging. There are 3, 5-star cobble sections and the race has 27 cobbled sections in total. The grading is based on the quality of the cobbles and the distance on them.
The most iconic section of the cobbles, pictured above is the Trouée d’Arenberg aka Arenberg Forest. It is 2400 meter section of cobbles, laid down at the time of Napoleon 1. The intensity of these cobbles is mind boggling especially coupled with the fact that the entry to the cobbles was on a downhill section, causing the riders to enter the section at a speed of 60 kmph. (A highly criticised chicane was added in 2024 to reduce the speed of entry). Even so, the Arenberg forest, about 100 kilometers from the finish is the place where the first selection is made from the group of favourites. There are 2 more sectors of the 5 star variety: the 3 km long Mons-en-Pévèle which has 2 right hand turns while climbing steadily and the decisive Carrefour de l’Arbre, which arrives 15 kilometers before the finish line. The 2.1 kilometer section is brutal, winding and with its proximity to the finish is often where the riders make the final attack.
As you can imagine, the race gets intense as the riders jostle with each other to get the best line over the cobbles, the bike shakes and you see bottles and parts fall out. These sections are narrow and if you get a flat, it is in your benefit that you’re in the front and can get a wheel change. If not, you get stuck behind and can lose a lot of time. In the words of a former 2nd place finisher and one of the icons of Paris-Roubaix, George Hincapie: “This is a war, you give them an inch, they will take a mile.” This race gets even more brutal when it rains. In the dry, the riders just inhale the dust of the cobbled sections. In the rain, they get covered in it.
If the selection hasn’t been made in the cobbles and there are still more than 1 riders in contention, the decisive move comes inside the iconic Roubaix Velodrome.
For all the twists and the Machiavellian turns, Paris Roubaix remains the best race in the spring classics for me.
In the words of the most winningest rider of the Paris-Roubaix, Tom Boonen:
The 2025 race was the surprising debut of Tadej Pogacar, who at 65 kilograms is much lighter than most of his rivals, including the pre-race favourite and 2-time defending champion, Matthieu Van Der Poel. Van Der Poel also was aiming to become the 1st man since Francesco Moser (1978, 1979, 1980) to win Paris Roubaix back-to-back, 3 times in a row.
The first selection in the race was made, as expected in the Arenberg forest with a bunch of the pre-race favourites including Wout Van Aert, Mads Pedersen, Pogacar’s teammate’s Nils Politt and Florian Vermeersch, and Van De Poel’s teammate, former 2nd place finisher Jasper Philipsen. Pogacar and Van Der Poel kept launching attacks from 100 kilometers out and it became a real war of attrition. Pogacar, who had already crashed earlier in the day, was almost got taken out by his team car.
With 55 kilometers to go, Pogacar launched an attack which left only Van Der Poel and Philipsen in his wake. As the race proceeded, another attack by Pogacar dropped Philipsen. With 30 kilometers to go, Pogacar took a strong right hand turn but didn’t slow down enough which caused him to crash into the barriers. Van Der Poel maintained a 20"" gap from Pogacar until Pogacar dropped off his bike and took a new bike with 20k to go. The gap grew to over a minute, but in the Carrefour de l’Arbre, it was Van Der Poel’s turn to change bikes. The change came quickly and though he nearly crashed into a barrier, Van Der Poel was never in doubt as he rounded up the Velodrome to take his 3rd Paris Roubaix win. Pogacar finished smiling, content with his 2nd place on his 1st showing here. Behind him, in a sprint Pedersen took the last podium spot, followed by Van Aert and then Vermeersch.
Thank you for reading!

Henry Miller is one dirty cunt. I’ve never read Marquis de Sade but I imagined that Miller to be a modern day Sade, blending all the taboos he can think about (and I can think about) into one novel. Miller is no stranger to being a banned author. Tropic of Cancer was banned in the author’s country of birth until 1961, almost thirty years after it made headways in Paris via the famous publisher Obelisk Press in 1934, where modern day Shakespeare and Co. Bookshop is now.
This is the reason I bought the book in the first place, on an obligatory purchase and visit to the well-renowned bookshop. It took me at least a couple of hours to decide which book to buy from the place. In all honesty, much of the book available on the shelves of Shakespeare and Co. are available in other bookshops and for cheaper. But I’m a bit pretentious at the best of times, so I needed to pick out a book. Henry Miller, who created a career in Paris and owed the city his success was a logical choice. I have not read Miller’s erotica, so why not eh.
When Miller wrote Under the Roofs of Paris (formerly known as Opus Pistorum), he was broke, hungry and would write a dollar a page for this kind of smut. Paris was known for its erotica back in the early twentieth century, its explicit postcards (which also feature prominently in the book) and smut writing was of no place to the conservative American mind at the time. But this sexual liberation was perhaps representative of Paris at the epoch, and it took an American to crystalise that epitome of recklessness.
In the introduction to Delta of Venus, Anaïs Nin spoke about Miller’s venture in writing erotica, that the collector wanted more, that the writers started to exhaust their personal stories and had to look elsewheres. I wonder if Milton Luboviski who commissioned Henry Miller for this was the same collector which demanded Miller to write with less poetry in his smut.
Perhaps not. Because I don’t find much poetry in the book. What we read is explicit sex, sometimes performed by individuals who shouldn’t be having sex. Some of the age is explicit, and the protagonist, Alf, had also indulged in engaging with these minors. I do feel sick at the thought of it and it makes me wonder whether Henry Miller had the same experiences. It would certainly adjust my respect for him as a person.
In the book, our protagonist Alf took part in bukkake-like orgies, a threesome with a midget (which also involves a German shepherd with a generous phallus which I guess makes it a foursome), threesomes with Lesbians, shooting porn, and let’s not talk about his involvement with underaged girls. All these leisurely activities are implemented in an extensive possible combinations of holes, body parts and bodily fluids. This list obviously, is far from exhaustive. Miller writes from experience, and whether some of these had happened to him or his acquaintances, I don’t really know nor do I really want to care.
Yes, I can find traces of Tropic of Cancer here with its crude and detailed description of sex, which makes me doubt if I am adventurous myself in that way. Alf’s organ, John Thursday, is akin to another character that literally always rear its ugly head at the worst (or best) of times. It’s like Alf has a constant walking erection. Alf and John Jeudi seem like different characters, but forever interlinked to one another and dependent on each other’s existence. Come to think of it, all men and their wangs are like that.
After the first hundred pages, the book loses its novelty, which also made me wonder if I had grown up too much to read Henry Miller. In Malay terms, we can say it’s “jelak” which means feeling eugh after having too much of something, usually after you’re halfway through that bowl of Peter’s pork noodles and you regretted getting a large portion instead of small. But comparing Miller’s writing to a bowl of hawker pork noodles is probably not the best idea.
In fact, if I can compare the reading experience with another book, it’d be Bret Easton Ellis’ American Psycho, where the violence felt too much after a while, too caricaturish, far an adaptation of what we know violence to be. The sex in Under the Roofs of Paris is of a similar nature. Never once do I feel the reality of it, however visceral or extreme the nature of it might be.
Now for the million dollar question: as an erotica, did it turn me on? Based on what I mentioned above, no. But there are bits of it that made me raise my eyebrows, and more often than not, bits of it where I’m just shaking my head and saying yeah nah in my head, impatient for the next scene to unravel. I’ve read the book in my commute home in trains and over coffee, but thankful and hopeful that nobody is peering over my shoulder and basking over the gratuitous language.
On a side note, there was also the matter of Billie and Jean, the former more of a lesbian than the latter. Did Michael Jackson steal his most famous song from the characters of Miller’s work? No matter, if it was coincidental, then more power to Henry Miller. Another vignette: the book’s original title, Opus Pistorum literally translates to the work of the miller. Clever cunt, that Henry guy.
— -
On another P.S.S. read this stupendous essay on Henry Miller by Victoria Best, if you really want to dig deep into Henry Miller’s life and his past traumas.

We sat on the steps leading from the Eiffel Tower down to the Seine, surrounded by people of all ages — some walking up and down, others sitting on the edges of the steps or the ledge behind the large platform between staircases. The violinist became more emphatic as he strummed out Imagine Dragons’ “Believer.” I watched a little boy climb the stairs and drop a coin into the black canvas bag the violinist had set in front of his violin case.
After soaking in the music for nearly an hour, we made our way down the second set of steps and over to the first ticket booth. The sun sets late in Paris in June. To capture the views of the city at night, we ordered two tickets for the 9:30 pm boat cruise.
Though the air was cool, the top level of the boat offered the best views. We floated down the Seine, under a bridge, past palaces and museums — the sky still bright above the Roman numerals on the clock of the Musée d’Orsay at 9:45 pm. The Notre Dame loomed on our left — scaffolds crisscrossing behind a massive red and white crane. Restoration from the fire wasn’t due to finish until December.
On our way back to the dock, bridges stood out like charcoal drawings against a pale orange…

I shouldn’t be getting into the habit of enjoying Easter holidays (or any holidays, Christian ones especially) and annual leave just in case I didn’t make it to extend my work visa, but truth be told? I do enjoy holidays as a normal person does and should.
For Easter this year, I went to Paris. When I received the job offer last September, I thought it would be proper that I started visiting some other great museums of ethnology or anthropology, so I could learn for my work. A great example is indeed, the Quai-Branly Museum in Paris, which I had heard several times when I was at school. This museum was definitely on my list of must-visit.
It wouldn’t be my first time to Paris as I went there almost a decade (2015) ago, during which I embarked on a less-than-72-hour marathon of “ticking the tourist’s boxes”: I was in Paris waiting for a flight back to Brno. As a poor student in one of the most expensive cities in the world, I tried to minimse my stay while trying to see EVERYTHING: Louvre? Tick. Château de Versailles? Tick. Champ Élysées? Tick. Eiffel Tower plus climbing it? Double tick.
I was not sure if this time would be better than a marathon, but I was aiming for a rather different route, i.e. another busman’s holiday of museums and histories. Yet, as the title suggest, unfortunately I was sick the whole time. To be specific, the moment I stepped off the Eurostar at Gare du Nord, I immediately realised my Easter holiday was going to be a bit of tumbling along the way.
There are two categories for my visits in Paris: the traditional way and the interactive way. Although the numbers of places in each category seem uneven, I want to bring out the distinction between this post and the next.
I definitely had to put this museum as №1 on my list, as I’m trying to be more prepared for my job at the MAA. I was also guranteed by many colleagues that I “wouldn’t regret”, “a must-see”, and they all left highly possitive comments for this particular museum. I therefore had really high hopes.
I arrived at the museum (with a low fever that was ready to rage in the following four hours) after I visited the Sainte-Chapelle in the morning. The entrance was rather empty, with a ramp that led to the main gallery. There was a large cylindircal space built with glass in the middle of the foyer, which ran through the floors and reached the basement, and through the dark frosty glass, it seemed to be a display gallery as well. (I will come back to this cool space)
Marching along the ramp, there was light and image of water ripples cast by an over-head projector, in hindsight reminding me the ramp of ocean tides that I once walked on in National Museum of Natural Science, Taiwan.
1.1 Oceania
I found myself standing in a tall and wide space, facing towards two galleries: On my right side was Pacific and Oceania; on my left was America. Immediately I was distracted by the large objects near me, which were displayed in a way familiar to me. Many photos of MAA taken by the visitors, no matter how randomly, often feature the large totem pole (1922.265), the slit gong, or the grizzly bear. It doesn’t mean that other collections are unimportant to them, neither does it mean that they learn a lot from these three display, but that they are large enough to be representative of a nice day-out on their photo albums. I am clearly biased for that I see MAA from a behind-the-scene, research-based perspective, and also I know a lot more collections that can be iconic. If I have to choose collections that represent MAA, I probably wouldn’t choose the above three. To me, the first impression of Quai-Branly, also the most impressive collections, could be these large wooden sculptured objects (masks, boards, ceremonial tools), but it may be completely different from what the staff members’ point of view.
Almost as a premonition, I stumbled across these two “boards” in a glass case. I didn’t know that later in April, after I came back from Paris, I would be seeing a large number of Gope boards with a researcher from West Australia. However, looking back the photos I took, I could see that both Quai-Branly and MAA shared a lot of common interest in terms of collecting policy, or put in another way, both museums were formed by early anthropologists who had a close network, who naturally formed the trendy studies of exploring the “unknown pacific islands” then.
I can recognise the very similar motifs of the face mask on the left side: heart-shape nostril, mushroom-shape dome above the head, and two dots, possibly pierced rings for decoration. All are present on the Gope boards I handled in mid-April. However, there are also a lot of features that I didn’t see on this face mask: The chevrons on relief, and the vibrant red, white, and black pigment commonly used. This object is also featured on Google Arts and Culture.

Many objects on display reminded me similar collections that I once saw and handled in MAA. Strangely, through this exploration I started appreciating more my work and the reason why anthropology matters: The physical material being preserved acts not only a reminder of the culture that exists (or existed), but also as an evidence that shows that culture constantly evolves, and that artistic choices change all the time. Take the chest ornament above for example. The feathers being a crucial part in Asmat art were incorporated in a contemporary artistic creation. The handbag in MAA inherits the traditional material and presents a new usage, becoming a new tradition for the anthropologists in the next century.
It was at this point when the fever kicked in. I started feeling a cold chill spreading from my lower back, but my face felt so warm and my throat was coarse. I thought, however, that I was simply dehydrated, which was why I persevered.
Remember the huge cylindrical space mentioned before? I reached the end of the Oceania zone and met it again. Seeing through the glass, I saw shelves and storage units stacked neatly, with musical instruments arranged among them. Originally I thought it was a behind-the-scene display, allowing the public to see what a music storage house would look like. The tags on objects made sense. However, I was wrong, at least not entirely wrong. It was an exhibition “Storage of the unspoken” (La reserve de non-dits) by Youmna Saba, who explored the “sonic behaviour” of the ethnographic musical instruments. In the English booklet, I shared the same frustration as the artist explained,
[…] a great enthusiasm, then a lack of breath, before frustration set in. What can an instrument express in a dark glass tower the public only passes by?
The irony of preserving anthropological objects is that the method to extend the life span is exact the same to stifle the purpose of its life. There comes the philosophical question that many face: What use of x, if it can not perform the function when it was created? Does it still count an x? If not, are we simply doing the formality?

The paradox is especially apparent on musical instruments, as they should be appreciated with hearing instead of looking. At the MAA, whenever there’s a community person visiting to see their own heritage collections, our policy is that they could choose to handle them with bare hands (without gloves), and it is amazing to see how, for example, musical instruments, sound when they are played. It is very tricky when it comes to wind instruments such as flutes, pipes, and horns, as we are not never sure if they were in contact with historical pesticide, which can make visitors sick. Nevertheless, the spirit is that the museum should be a place where people make the material legacies alive. I would love to know if this large display allowed people to physically handle the collections (it seemed close when I visited). If yes, how would the experience proceed?
At this point, you should find out that I had reached another section, Asia. Seeing the Paiwan ancestor board was really a nice heads-up. Another thing was that my fever was getting worse and I felt even more dehydrated.
!! Notice!!
There might be human remains (ashes) in the collections in the next photo. Readers discretion.
I was thrilled to learn more about shadow puppets from the audio guide. Apparently the fantastic performanceship originated in India, rather than China, which I was told as a kid. The story and the characters indeed changed and evolved as the style migrated and spread among different Asian regions. My first experience with shadow puppets was sorting them from the Skeat collection, which were less elaborate but all the same, impressive (See Z 33667 and Z 33587). I also admire how the Quai-Branly used light box to display the puppets, bringing the colours and crafting details to the eyes.
One can tell that I sped up my visiting pace as I didn’t take that many photos in Asia section.
The monologue I had upon seeing the Benin Bronzes was probably the same when visitors came to the MAA and saw exactly the same display. I have tried to explain to friends that museums simply couldn’t “pack them and ship them back to Nigeria”. If only it were that easy! Shame it’s not wrapping and mailing Christmas gift for Auntie Gladys. The most difficult part is never the practicality of packing and courriering, but the politics and funding that are involved in the repatriation process. Nevertheless, museums are not at liberty to share the details, which are the gap between them and the public.
I was really speeding up my visit without skipping too many collections on display, because my fever was getting a bit out of control. At one point I just felt I couldn’t get up and all I wanted was gulping water. There were at least two school groups at the same time so I used that as an excuse to proceed faster. The royal statue was the last before I moved on to the last section — America.
If I were to commit to a specific area of expertise, the First Nationas people in North America would probably be my second choice, other than East Asia. I know very little about them, but from what I was told and saw, I can relate the history of driving the indigenous people to extinction and how their land and language were taken away.
With a curator like Anita, a lot of research visits at MAA focused on American culture. I am not a stranger to many above. I was especially surprised to see the cape as I was 100% sure there was an identical copy of it in our own gallery, and I also saw the same design on a flyer for the MA Anthropology at Sainsbury’s Centre, UEA. I asked Rachel about it, and she told me that it was a popular design, and that was why it was widely used in woven textiles as gifts.
I spent around four to five hourse in the whole museum, and was absolutely drained when I left the place. I didn’t realise how sick I was until I realised I didn’t even want to shop in the souvenir stores, which I regret because I would love to get a tote bag. I got some flu medicine on my way home.
I had wonderful impression of Quai-Branly. The level and scale are what I envision how a museum of “world anthropology” should be. I still don’t think any museum in the world would be fit for the title “wold anthropology” for a simple reason: All collectors have preferences that are derived from their generations of academic focus, and those preferences are the reason why many museums don’t have the same level of attention on all cultures. Take the zeal for Oceania and Pacific Islands for example, both Quai-Branly and MAA have extensive resources and materials from the region. However, when it comes to Asia, they are usually relatively ignorant. I have to say that I do feel jealous — if that is a fair term to use here — because of my heritage, but I also don’t want to take away people’s attention on any minority groups.
2. Le Louvre, 29 March 2024
As I scrolled through my photo album, I realised that I did not actually like Le Louvre as a museum. If you quickly scroll through this section and compare the amount I wrote about it with Museum d’Orsay (next), you will know which museum I prefer.
My first visit to Le Louvre nine years ago was mainly to tick the box of “see the Mona Lisa (La Joconde)”, which I should say was a half-tick, because I never really saw it in an appropriate distance. My impression for the rest of the galleries was a bit blurred, and this was what I planned to revisit and take a good look.
I couldn’t describe how weird I felt when I stood at the grand foyer, looking at at least three moving escalators extending and ascending to mezzanines. I couldn’t, however, describe why I felt the deju-vu unsettling until I wrote these words down: It was a memory of rushing and running through the corridors, feeling pressed and shame because I couldn’t see the paintings. I have a strange habit: If I don’t get to enjoy a good thing properly the first time, I somehow would avoid coming back and re-enjoy it again. Possibly out of guilt and embarrassment.
I studied the map a little bit and tried to figure out which galleries I possibly had visited before just to avoid them. I didn’t, so I just randomly hopped on one of the escalators and was taken to a broad court full of Roman sculptures. It was a strange space for a brief moment, but in a good sense: The court was quite far away from the early morning crowd who were sprinting towards the Mona Lisa, so I could only hear the low and muffled talking and shouting through the walls. The majority interior design, including the sculptures, was white, reflecting the light and the cloudy sky from a high glassed ceiling. There were only a few visitors and they were sitting on foldable chairs, focusing on their sketches. I guess they were art students. I felt like wondering in a giant bubble in a sci/art-fi movie. In retrospection I am glad that my visit began in a quiet corner instead of another immediate overwhelm.
My strategy for visiting route is wondering and meadering, and avoiding the Mona Lisa at all cost (which is wise for a reason). Overall, I wasn’t impressed by what I saw that day; however, I found something new and it was a nice surprise.
I hope that one day someone could explain to me how or why there is a room full of historical scientific instruments in the Sulley Gallery. For a brief moment I thought I was at the Whipple Museum French Branch, as I could point to every object and name them: Butterfield type sundial, possibly of Augsberg and French made; equinotical ring dial; diptych dial; compendium; astrolabe; compound microscope, etc.. I tried to find more information about provenance and acquisition details but there wasn’t too much about them on the Louvre website. I’m also really intrigued to find out the curatorial reason behind the public display as I don’t think they relate to any other “artistic” collections nearby.
It was wonderful to see the gallery of Egyptian mummies and I vaguely remembered seeing them during the first visit. No surprise, it was fully packed with visitors. I felt a bit uneasy because I thought of the issues of displaying human remains, and all the discussion as a museum professional. Seeing so many visitors still not caring at all about what I thought was strangely unsettling and relaxing: I don’t think museums would ever be able to tell everyone how to behave around human remains, especially something with such high profile. A proportion of visitors will forever remain ignorant and have no regard towards any cultural sensitivity. I’m not saying that museums should stop trying to raise the awareness of respect and privacy, but to forbid a certain approach based on reasons hard to judge, i.e. whether the photos were taken out of despise/entertaiment/respect, is also a restriction of speech and could potentially create another type of dominance.
I don’t think I would want to come back to the Louvre the third time. Aesthetically it is an amazing museum, but I don’t resonate with the collections inside.
3. Musée d’Orsay, 31 March 2024
Before this trip, whenever I mentioned that I had been to Paris (ten years ago, almost), I had to say that I regretted not going to Museum d’Orsay. Yes, I knew it was famous and a must-go, but the decade-ago me was more keen on ticking the bucket list and less a museum person.
One of my colleagues was a passionate advocat of the museum. “Absolutely gorgeous” she said. And I found myself standing under an enormous arc where the train used to stop, now stood stunning marble sculptures.
It was stunning to see all three sculptures (above) displayed ensemble. The clever use of bronze for the sitters’ complexion and the amazing texture of onyx for their outfits really brought out them to life. What’s more interested is the labels: All three sculptures were under different titles once, given by the artist. They were renamed to avoid outdated historical racism.
www.musee-orsay.fr
I am always a fan of watching how the westerners portrait what the world looks like to them. I started paying more attention to this type of creation when I visited the Frederiksborg Castle in Copenhagen, seeing the four corners painted on the ceiling of the Audience Room that depicted the four continents of the globe. I realised how distant it was for the artist to even grasp the concept of what Asia was: The corner painting featured a Turkish man with a turban and a glorious moustache; a camel kneeling beside him.
Contrary to putting a Turk as a representation for Asia, the bronze sculpture in Museum d’Orsay, created in the 19th century, featured a more East-Asian-looking person, possibly because of wars and trade in East Asia. I would say this is how geopolitics are involved in art. On a closer look, as I wrote down this late journal, I noticed that the Asian representation was actually a female (the bossom) with a male braid. How bizzare and intriguing! Was this an intentional decision by the artist? Or was this simply a mixed-up?
A great deal of my visit time was spent in the exhibition Paris 1874: Inventer l’impressionnisme, which in the beginning I didn’t plan to go. However, I couldn’t resist a free exhibition and the fabulous paintings by Monet, plus the queue was not crazy long. In the end, I made the little detour and joined the little crowd (which turned into a massive herd when I left).
I thought it was going to be a “nice and little” exhibition featuring Monet and others (who, unfortunately, I didn’t know. That’s why I only named Monet). Have I been more wrong than this? Probably not. It was an exhibition about impressionism, but it provided a profound historical context on the social change and artistic evolution that led towards the familiar style we know today. There were lots of sketches, photos, and archives that scafolded the beginning of impressionism before I finally saw the Sunrise painting. During the visit I sometimes felt quite embarrassed because I clearly was not up for such in-depth cultural education, especially I was planning on visiting a niche museum later that day.
Every time I see a chinoiserie style in a painting or as an interior design, I always feel surreal. As a child I felt that Eastern elements were strictly limited in Asia, and to see them in a western setting was like seeing an ostrich among chickens — odd and distinctive. Questions like “Did they already know where China and Japan were?”, “have they seen our stuffs already?” and “did they know any Asian person?” will always be in my head. I wonder if it’s the same surreal feeling for a westerner to see late Qing court paintings, which were profoundly influenced by Jesuit missionaries.
That was the last painting I took picture of in the exhibition. It was extremely crowded and noisy so it was a good time to get out of the place.
I became a fan of Cézanne during my teenage time. I appreciate the saturation of colour as well as the clear boundary lines he used.
“Les Âges de l’ouvrier” was a gem among all the artworks that I took picture of. Fédéric was a symbolist painter, which means that his artworks usually contained hints and audience needed to read between the lines. The painting is presented in a triptych, which resembles a traditional religious arrangement. Among the children playing cards (symbolising vice and greed) is a boy, behind who a basket at his head position resembles a saint’s halo.
I finally acscended to the second floor where I was surprised to find a large crowd at the restaurant, and an even larger crowd straining their necks in front of, not just anyone’s, but VAN GOGH’s famous painting of the yellow room. I am never a fan of Van Gogh, so I used this as an excuse and skirted through the gallery.
I was glad to finish my first visit to the Orsay with Monet’s most acclaimed artworks. It was definitely a brief visit, but I made sure I had time to go through all the galleries. If there was any regret, I would say it was that I didn’t get a tote bag (but I bought a T-shirt with Monet’s artwork!).
Overall, I like Museum d’Orsay. It’s incredibly large with amazing artworks; everyone is going to find a piece of art that they like. I appreciate the map and directions that point to the highlight for a quick visit. The audio guide was insightful, though I was hoping for a more flexible touch, such as the one I had in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. The gift shop was nice (I only realised the importance of a good gift shop after this visit and I may come up with a short post about why they are important) but the location was quite awkward.
4. Musée Fragonard, 31 March 2024
I left Museum d’Orsay about two o’clock. Rather early for me; I usually reserve a whole day for just one museum visit. However, I was on a mission to a special museum before I left Paris — Musée Fragonard.
Make no mistake, this is not the Perfume Museum and it has nothing to do with Fragonard the perfumist. I believe that the name Fragonard is a coincident, that this oldest veterinarian school in France happens to have the same name with the perfume brand.
The museum isn’t in the city centre and I had to spend almost an hour from Panthéon (a small detour after Museum d’Orsay) on bus. It was pouring and I felt like the bus was waddling through a sudden flood in Paris, but gladly the tempest died when I finally arrived. I spent some time asking around because I found myself in the middle of a college on a Sunday, when no one stayed in the classroom. Two ladies pointed me the way.
People who know me can always be certain that I’m a big fan of medicla museums. I was definintely gutted to learn later that Musée de l’Histoire de la Médecine was not open due to Easter holiday, but I still had the chance to visit something related — animal anatomy, or vet science.
The Fragonard Museum was definitely a quirky place that can be easily recognised as a university museum: It is tucked away in a humble teaching block; except a few signs and a sleepy security guard 500 meters away, there was no sign to direct the visitors.
I was, nevertheless, amazed by the enlarged teaching models neatly arranged in the display cases. I had never been to a historical vet science museum, so it was a little bit overwhelming at first (especially I only had two hours before the museum closed, and I intended to listen to every.audio.episode.)
Not to sound like a Y2K emo teen but I love anything that associates with death. The rituals that human plan and do in order to mark, remember, relieve, and avoid death are remarkable… They are the last chance for the dead to look back the living world, and the living to forsee what it will be like when we step into the unknown. Object that we study in order to understand death are similar to that. Is this the reason why museums now talk more about resepcting human remains? I wonder; but if bones of human beings are to be treated differently, how come we don’t apply the same attitude towards other animals’ bones? I also think about the lines between collections treated in a scientific and anthropological manner: If a human skull was collected for scientific racism study, it would migrate to repatriation based on anthropological reason. However, animals that sacrifice or were intentinally made ill for scientific purposes were less likely to be treated with anthropological sensitivity.
I wish that there were more textual labels along the display, as the audio guide did not help memorise (it was great content, though, very informative). Or perhaps I just need to find another way to record what I heard on the audio guide.
However, I managed to remember one thing from the audio guide. The pictures above showed the signature on one of the anatomical models, E. Petitcolin, dated 1901. It stands for Eugène Petitcolin, the preparator and model maker of the vet school.
My experience at the Whipple Museum left a valuable lesson in my mind, that all of the great scientific achievement would not have been possible were it not for the tool makers, publishers, etc.. Our education focuses a lot on the theories proposed by the great theoretician and philosophers, but not much time is spent on what compliment their success. Take Auzoux’s papier-mâché human model for example: Hundreds of thousands (an underestimation) of medical students would not have become doctors if there hadn’t been a chance to test their knowledge before practicing on patients. Some of the model makers even took their craftmanship to the next level: Not only were they accurate and precise, but the colour and material made these models, though mass produced, artistic, offering inspiration and perspective on life and the wonder of it.
Petitcolin worked his whole life for the vet school and was a pioneer in model making and preservation. I appreciate how the museum preserved these historical teaching tools, and it was wonderful that he gets to be featured in the tour. I think all museums should, if given chances, reflect upon the assistants and technicians that did the bidding. One example that I feel right is the rooms at the Centre of Material Culture (of MAA), which are named after Clare Isobel Fell (archaeologist, 1912–2002), Samuel Cowles (museum assistant), and Maureen M. O’Reilly (assistant curator), who were women and assistant dedicating their lives to the work, but not necessarily remembered in the history.
However, this is not the highlight of the Fragonard Museum.
! Attention!
The photo below contain human remains. Readers’ discretion advised.
These are écorchées, or the flayed collections. Made by Honoré Fragonard (1732–1799), who used to teach anatomy in the vet school, these are considered the treasures of the museum. The technique that Fragonard employed is still not fully understood. I could see that this was dry specimen, and I assumed that the material involved a lot of wax, hence the shiny gloss on the surface. My impression was proved right when I read later, that these creations were made not based on anatomical studies, but more for a theatrical performance. I definitely felt the intense glare from the first standing man, Goliath. I feel very fortunate that I am not bothered by such beautiful creation because I can imagine many people shying away, and I understand that.
This is probably the longest post I’ve written in English so far. I’ve waited a long time before I even started writing it, and procrastinated several times because life since April has been like being strapped on a rocket while skating on icy road, totally chaotic.
I have a mixture of positive and negative views on Paris as a city and the two visits I’ve made so far. I think it is a wonderful metropolitan: sleek, chic, vibrant, and everyone can have a place; and yet I don’t feel like I can find a place there, just as I feel about London. However, this is not a travel blog.
As for museums, I absolutely give them a five star overall. During this trip, I have ticked more boxes on my bucket list, without loosing the quality and depth that I was looking for. The regret that I didn’t get to visit Museum of the History of Medicine is a strong reason to bring me back to this city.

I returned to Paris last week, still feeling bruised by the US election. I had volunteered for the Harris campaign in Pennsylvania in the month leading up to Nov 5., and I was so relieved that Teresa my beloved spouse and I were at last able to resume our carefree life as flâneurs in Paris. Flâneur is a most delightful French word that means to wander about without specific purpose, just observing the world.
Relieved, yes. But I still felt a lump of dread in the pit of my stomach like an undigested rotten sausage.
The weather was grey and rainy — not surprising for mid-November in Paris, but not really conducive to long walks or for lifting one’s mood. Teresa, however, needed some replacement light bulbs. So one afternoon last week, a trip to the hardware store was mandatory. The rain was not stopping, so finally, I just said fuck it, and headed out into the drizzle.
The route to the hardware store lay along one of my favorite walks, the Coulée Vert, or “Greenway.” It’s a disused tram line that has been repurposed and replanted as an urban garden path — if you…

Revoir Paris | Essay Three
I spent a month in Paris, this time, and could simply be there, live there, and revisit places and experiences that I have loved.
Mostly it didn’t rain.
As the days passed under skies of blue or mother-of-pearl, and I relearned the layout of favorite boulevards and quarters and how to take buses everywhere, and eventually mastered how to make it back to the hotel tucked into a sidestreet without first overshooting the mark, Paris began to feel more familiar than ever it had before.
Perhaps I could finally live there because in previous visits I had ticked the tourist sites off the list, and made the big-ticket historical, artistic, and literary pilgrimages, and thus had no further itch to scratch.
Or perhaps it was because while there I turned seventy (which was the idea) and brought to the adventure a mellowing soul.
I think it was the latter reason, mostly, but also because I had flown to peacetime Paris from a war zone and could remind myself viscerally and experientially of what I know intellectually: that a whole, beckoning world exists that is not at war, and that in the absence of war, life can be brilliant, creative, and happy.
Paris has not always been at peace, of course.
Some people know about the Hundred Years’ War between England and France (1337–1453).
Everyone in the world has heard about the French Revolution (1789–1799) — and some know of the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) and the Paris Commune (1871). [1]
Many people know about the high price in blood paid by the French in WWI; some would argue that this led a still shell-shocked populace to follow WWI hero Philippe Pétain into WWII collaboration with Hitler.
If you notice shrapnel-pockmarked building facades from the Nazi era, or memorial signage on buildings, you will learn of Vichy (French) police roundups of Jews and Gestapo executions of Resistants in the very heart of Paris. [2] & [3]
But on this day especially, the world — my whole world — became a jewel box (the Théâtre du Palais-Royal [4]) nested within a coffer (the Domaine national du Palais-Royal) nested within a treasure chest (the Palais-Royal quarter of the 1st arrondissement).
I paused at the southern entrance to the Jardin du Palais-Royal to admire Paravent Girls [5], an Art Basel Paris bronze installation by Egyptian multimedia artist Ghada Amer [6], and then flânered the lovely garden’s length.
I was on my way to the Théâtre du Palais-Royal to meet my cousin and her husband at a performance of L’extraordinaire Destinée de Sarah Bernhardt:
The stage goddess (b. 1844 — d. 1923) lived a hard-working, celebrated life, [7] and like today’s rock stars and pop divas, toured the world “collecting men and animals, having a baby with a prince. . . and doing it all with extravagance, humor, and unfailing commitment.” [8]
The producers were wise to stage the show in so sumptuous a playhouse! Seated on red velvet — or velour? — inside so gilded and plush a venue, one can’t pretend for a second that one has not come to lose oneself entirely in theatrical magic.
Now it is Saturday night at dusk in sharp weather. Night is rapidly falling as my cousin’s husband, Alain, shepherds us across Place Colette, where a crowd couples-dances en plein air to a live jazz and blues orchestra.
We wait on a curb at a red light in a drizzle. From afar, shimmering ice-blue diamonds jet and spill up and down the height of the Eiffel Tower [9]; the Tuileries’ Roue de Paris (ferris wheel) glitters like a diamond-studded hoop suspended in air.
Alain hails us a cab on Avenue de l’Opéra; the grand thoroughfare pulses with neon signage and street lamps and head and tail lights that shimmer off the wet pavement as if they are sequins and gemstones: rubies, diamonds, emeralds!
A switch flips in my neurocircuitry already buzzing from having been to the theater. But now outside in the dark amid festive crowds, the myriad lights have jolted me even more widely awake and strongly alive.
Sparklers go fizzing and blazing through my arteries. My whole bloodstream effervesces! If I weren’t bundled in a fleece jumper and down vest, my skin would be emitting visible sparks.

When I was in college, I was part of a student organization whose goal is to facilitate the onboarding of international students by organizing meetups, dinners, and events.
I met and spent a lot of time with students from all walks of life. Among them, I found a special connection with French.
This bond wasn’t just about shared interests or hobbies; it went deeper, touching on I believe shared values, philosophies, and outlooks on life.
Something about their simplicity, authenticity, and rawness fascinated me.
I met more than twenty French students in college. Not all at the same time. But I’ve always found myself spending time with them. Hanging out. Going out. Drinking at a local bar. Eating at a Chinese restaurant.
As a matter of fact, my go-to friend group in college consisted of 60% French. I’ve always felt home with them. Always felt happy with them.
It’s funny because a lot of Americans dislike French people as they can come off as rude or uptight. Some even complain about how they reek of cigarettes. I even have friends of mine who had terrible experience when they visited Paris because of these and some say it’s overrated.

And I’m (finally) okay with that.
I’ve done my fair share of traveling — much more than I ever would have thought I would when I was much younger. I’ve been to many more than half of the states in the United States. I have been to Europe a handful of times and have enjoyed the sights and sounds of at least ten countries over there. I’ve been to Canada and Mexico. I’ve been to a significant number of islands in the Caribbean.
Sounds pretty good, if I do say so myself.
It’s just that there has been this one location — this one place — this one dream vacation spot of a lifetime, that has eluded me for lo these many years.
That locale — the stuff of fantasy and romance — is, of course, Paris.
These weren’t postcards from places I had actually seen. Nope, as a child my family’s annual vacation destination was our local zoo.
These were postcards I begged for from friends, family, friends of the family and the family of friends.
Anyone, going anywhere, all I asked was a cool shot of something tourist worthy. For the most part, I was indulged in my requests.

Deliberately choosing to visit France in September — right after the 2024 Olympics turned out to be a great decision for me. The places I visited were less crowded, allowing me to take my time and even meet up with dear friends whom I hadn’t seen in a very long time because we lived on different continents.
I spent the last two days of my delightful trip to France in Paris, savoring delicious French cuisine, visiting iconic landmarks, and immersing myself in the diverse Parisian culture. During my time there, I had the pleasure of meeting up with another dear friend who traveled from Brussels to join me.
One time, we were trying to go to the Arc de Triomphe and we made a wrong turn and ended up taking the metro in the opposite direction of where we were supposed to go. We found ourselves at the final stop of a metro line in a neighborhood on the outskirts of Paris. Despite the unexpected detour, I didn’t worry. My friend and I laughed so hard and took it as part of the adventure…

Paris, the most visited city in the world. There are many popular conceptions of Paris, some positive, others negative. There are those that say Paris is the most beautiful and romantic city on the planet, while others talk about how dirty the streets of Paris are and claim that Parisians are rude and the whole city is overrated. I fall more in the middle, leaning to the positive side. I think Paris is an amazing place, though it’s not my favorite in the world.
When I left the Paris-Nord train station, after taking a train from London that went through the English Channel, I immediately noticed major differences in mannerisms and behavior of the French compared to the English.
Although England is technically a foreign country, as an American it didn’t feel too different from the United States. Sure, the English speak in a different accent and use different phrases, but the common language and the cultural similarities made me feel like I wasn’t in a foreign land, even though I was.
When I was in France, however, I truly did feel that I was in foreign territory. One of the first things I noticed when I got out of the train station was that almost everyone was smoking cigarettes. The French also talked faster, and, from my experiences, had a different idea of personal space (not that it’s always a bad thing).

“It has bothered me all my life that I do not paint like everybody else.”
On the first Monday of summer, June 5, 1905, the Gare de Lyon train station teemed with fashionable Parisians preparing for their annual journey to the south of France. Only they preferred Côte d’Azur — like it was a club with an admissions committee, an invited guest list, a velvet rope, and a charming hostess waiting to welcome them. To them, paradise was a familiar word, wrapped in the routine and privilege of their opulent lives. They imagined strolling arm-in-arm down sunlit promenades, exchanging knowing glances with others who happened to look, dress, and speakl just like them. It was so comforting to be seated at seaside cafés, secure in one’s place — and equally certain that, beyond their tiny polished circle, little else really mattered. They were happy people, perhaps ridiculously so.
A different story awaited in the third-class compartment: thirty-six-year-old Henri Matisse wasn’t chasing the sun; he was escaping ruin. Although he too was once welcomed in Parisian society, he now wore a corduroy suit like a prison uniform, faded to a reddish-brown, and blending into the threadbare seat beneath him. He looked more vineyard worker than artist — save for the paintbox and collapsible easel at his feet. His face was etched with lines from sleepless nights and empty pockets, carrying the weight of three years of failure and rejection. This was the new Henri Matisse, one who had aged and fallen. Had you whispered to his fellow passengers that one day he would shake the art world to its core the laughter would have been raucous and infectious.
Even his wife, Amélie, who sat next to him, would give you a skeptical glance. Even her expression was tense with quiet concern, and this was no leisurely getaway to the Riviera. The couple wasn’t bound for seaside promenades serenaded by Mediterranean breezes. They had no home to go to, and no friends when they arrived. In fact were escaping a life that had unraveled, fleeing to a place that might offer at least a reprieve from despair if not the justice system.
Matisse’s fall from grace had been sharp. The Parisian art world once welcomed him with cautious optimism, but now turned its delicate pale back. Friends disappeared, patrons closed their wallets, and a once-promising career had sputtered. It was his fault, too. Rumors of a financial scandal hovered around him like a thick fog, deepening his isolation. Once a successful lawyer, Matisse abandoned that career to follow his passion for painting, but now even that seemed as enticing as a wet pavement.
As the train pulled out of the station, leaving behind the familiar smells of crusty baguettes, pungent cheeses, and steaming bowls of oxtail soup, Matisse cast a final glance at his former home. He was leaving behind more than Paris; he was abandoning a world that seemed so full of promise, now reduced to broken dreams. Yet, as the train chugged along the tracks, his mood astonishingly began to lift. Amid the despair, a quiet resolve began to take root. The storm within him receded as Matisse made a vow — he would find his voice again, silence the doubts, and reclaim his life on his own terms.
No matter how long it took.
Which is what is so ironic about the story of Henri Matisse in Collioure. Little did he or anyone else realize that in just 100 days, this trek south would not only transform his career but reshape the entire art world, leading to one of the most revolutionary periods in the history of painting.
In fact, Paris would never look at a canvas the same way again.
But what was about to happen wasn’t a miracle nor an act of faith. It was something deeper and perhaps more fundamental to the human condition. Henri Matisse was about to discover a Thrive Zone — a place where the spirit is liberated, creativity reignited, and the soul is fully restored. These are places where we become ourselves in spite of the rest of the world telling us not to be.
This is the story of how one summer in a small fishing village in the south of France set the stage for a transformation that would forever alter Matisse — and leave an indelible mark on the world of art.
“There are flowers everywhere for those who want to see them.”
A cynic would say every form of refuge has its a price. For Henri Matisse, his career suffered from entrapment in the bleak industrial landscape of Normandy. As a young boy growing up there, life was marked by the unrelenting grayness, suffocated by coal dust. He believed the world was colored in sodden skies, and monotony was the color of choice. Matisse would later recall, “Women wore black, and everyone wore a hat. It is a place where people don’t expect too many strangers.”
Even Art historian Hilary Spurling noted this was true, his early works were “restrained and traditional,” lacking the spark that would later come to define his painting. Only the public wasn’t interested in somber landscapes — it craved beauty, spectacle, and illusion.
Desperate for cash, Matisse even offered one of his canvases to his brother Auguste for 100 francs. The reply was as frigid as the Norman winter: “I’d rather have a new bicycle.” But the struggle was about more than selling paintings. Matisse was caught in a larger battle, a fight to find his place in a world that seemed hopelessly duplicitous and divided. He valued integrity in expression more than wealth, but now he was bereft of both.
Born in 1869 during the twilight of the Victorian era, Matisse’s formative years spanned the Belle Époque — a time of shimmering contradictions. Paris, the “City of Light,” was both a beacon of modernity and a place of deep inequality as well as rigid social structure. The elite lived in the glow of freshly minted francs, while the working classes toiled in the shadows. The surface gleamed, but underneath, resentment simmered.
It was into this paradoxical cauldron, where new industrial fortunes clashed with the remnants of old-world aristocracy, that Matisse and his wife Amélie found themselves thrust — while the working classes — barely literate, and so barely counted — were left to their laughter, tobacco pipes, and homemade plum wine. The glittering surface of society masked deep divisions — while the elite flaunted their wealth, resentment simmered among the lower classes.
It was how the Matisse’s became collateral damage in one of the most infamous financial scandals of their time — the Humbert Affair. A master manipulator named Thérèse Humbert had defrauded thousands through an audacious Ponzi scheme, borrowing nearly 100 million francs based on the collateral of a fictitious inheritance. By sheer misfortune, the Matisse family became entangled.
Matisse’s father in law was arrested, and the artist, a former lawyer, came to his defense. He wasn’t a conspirator, but the scandal stained his reputation and he became swept up in the deluge. And as the Humbert empire crumbled, so too did the Matisse’s stature. He found himself facing public outrage and financial ruin.
Stripped of dignity and resources, the couple with their inlaws had to fleeParis, no longer sure of their place in the world. Yet, what they sought in the south wasn’t luxury — it was something else, renewal it would turn out. Matisse was no longer simply searching for a place to escape; he was searching for a space to thrive.
“We ought to view ourselves with the same curiosity and openness with which we study a tree, the sky or a thought.”
Thérèse Humbert was the architect of one of the most notorious frauds in French history. Her rise to the top of Parisian society had been built on audacious lies, and equally fake noble lineage. To bolster her imagined wealth, she concocted an elaborate story about saving the life of a fictional American millionaire, Robert Crawford, who, according to her story, had gratefully left her a vast fortune. For over two decades, Humbert borrowed millions against this supposed inheritance, living a life of luxury while her lenders, many of them ordinary citizens, were left in the dark.
Through a web of deceit that had gone undetected for years — protected by her father-in-law, a Minister of Justice — Humbert finally acquired a newspaper owned by Armand Parayre, Henri Matisse’s father-in-law. This tangled connection dragged the Matisse family into the scandal’s orbit, even though they were unwitting victims themselves. But when the supposed inheritance was revealed to be nothing but a single red brick, the scandal erupted and scapegoats were needed.
France was outraged. The Humberts fled, leaving ruin in their wake. And while Matisse and his family although not accomplices, were tainted by their association. It took very little time before they found themselves swept up in the aftermath of one of the country’s largest Ponzi schemes.
The financial ruin, public scandal, and professional rejection that surrounded Matisse pushed him further toward collapse. No longer able to support his family or continue his art with any hope of stability, Matisse felt crushed by the weight of his failures. The Parisian society that had once nurtured his ambition now seemed intent on devouring him.
Yet, in the face of this disaster, the fall became the prelude to something greater.
The seeds of transformation were planted.
“I would like to recapture that freshness of vision which is characteristic of extreme youth when all the world is new to it.”
Sometimes, utter rejection is the precursor of renewal. For Matisse, this state of affairs forced him to seek refuge not just from scandal and poverty, but from the creative limitations he had unknowingly imposed on himself. Desperate and exhausted, Matisse and his wife Amélie left Paris for a small fishing village near the Spanish border.
Collioure wasn’t St. Tropez as they couldn’t afford the luxuries of the French Riviera that Paris’s elite were accustomed to. Instead, they found themselves in a fishing village hit hard by economic ruin and the collapse of its anchovy trade and vineyards, ravaged by the Phylloxera plague. The town, at first glance, appeared worn, scarred by decline and poverty.
Yet to Matisse, it held something far more precious than wealth.
“The light here is different,” Matisse would later say.
It wasn’t just an illusion either. Collioure had unfiltered Mediterranean light that revealed colors that Matisse had never seen before — due to the only East facing coastline in France where the Pyranees majestically seem to dive into the water. The reflections of the sea, the interplay of light and shadow, the vivid hues that soaked into the village streets — became his metaphor. A light which casts no shadows and eradicates contrasts. It was a new artistic language, one that spoke to him in a way that Paris never could.
Where others saw a town in decline, Matisse saw a world bursting with possibility. The decay of the fishing industry and the blighted vineyards faded into the background. For the first time in years, Matisse felt a spark of creative energy return. His focus shifted away from survival and toward the rediscovery of beauty.
The transition was profound. In Paris, Matisse had been trapped in a world of muted tones, of compromise and caution. But in Collioure, he began to embrace boldness, color, and exuberance. The sun-drenched hues of the Mediterranean landscape — lavenders, blues, deep reds, and oranges — burst into his work, freeing him from the restraint that had shackled his earlier paintings.
This was no accident. Collioure had become more than just a change of scenery; it had become Matisse’s personal Thrive Zone.
A Thrive Zone isn’t just a place to live or work; it’s a place where one’s potential is not only nurtured but liberated. It’s an environment where time takes on a different momentum, allowing creativity, growth, and transformation to flourish.
In Collioure, Matisse found exactly that — a space where the constraints of his old life could no longer bind him, where his art could breathe and expand beyond anything he had imagined in Paris.
“What I dream of is an art of balance, of purity and serenity, devoid of troubling or depressing subject matter, something like a good armchair.”
The pinnacle of this transformation came in the form of one of Matisse’s first works of the summer of 1905 appropriately titled, Open Window, Collioure. It wasn’t just a painting — it was a declaration of freedom that overcame him as he gazed from his hotel window.
In this work, Matisse blurred the boundaries between interior and exterior, between the familiar and the unknown. The colors — vivid and alive — reflected his internal transformation. Where traditional art sought to mimic life, Matisse’s work was life, vibrating with the energy of the Mediterranean.
Gone were the muted tones and tight brushstrokes that had once defined his work. In Collioure, Matisse embraced a radical new approach to color and form. His brushstrokes were loose, unrestrained, and alive. This work wasn’t just a product of technique, he was the same artist he had been in Paris just a week earlier — it was the product of an environment.
The vibrant colors of Collioure found their way into the depth of Matisse’s discouragement, and for the first time in his life, he felt free to paint in a way that was entirely his own. The shift was so dramatic that it left the Parisian art world stunned. Open Window and the thirty other paintings Matisse completed that summer heralded the birth of Fauvism, a revolutionary movement that would redefine modern art.
In one summer in 1905 he would paint over 50 pieces, and three of the ten greatest works of his life. Of course, the critics in Paris, accustomed to the soft realism of the old masters, were appalled. Matisse’s use of color was too wild, his forms too chaotic. His work was dubbed “Fauvism,” meaning “wild beasts,” a derogatory term meant to criticize the audacity of the movement.
But Matisse, like the light of Collioure, was undeterred. He had found his Thrive Zone, and he would never again return to the constraints of his old life.
“You can’t help getting old, but you can help becoming old.”
Henri Matisse once said, “There are flowers for those who want to see them.” But perhaps the deeper question isn’t why we see flowers — but who plants them in the first place. In Collioure, Matisse found not just refuge but renewal. Freed from the biting skepticism of Parisian critics who had dismissed his work as “scribblings of a wild beast,” he discovered a simpatico community — comrades who shared his love of nature and painted alongside him, as well as villagers who embraced his curious habit of standing before a canvas all day. Among them, he painted with abandon, as if creating art were play, not work.
For him, the humble fishing village was more than a refuge from Parisian humidity or a place of cheap lodgings. It was where the “flowers” of creativity were planted — a nurturing environment that welcomed his restless, rebellious spirit and spoke to his innermost feelings and beliefs.
Mornings spent painting in a modest studio overlooking the beach flowed effortlessly into afternoons of fish stew and Picpoul de Pinet. The Mediterranean light transformed the village’s modest facades into shimmering mosaics of lavender, red, and blue. Even the coarse shouts of fishermen, carried on salt-laden breezes in ancient Occitan, held an unexpected poetry.
What Matisse found in Collioure wasn’t merely an inspirational technique — it was a shift in his approach to life and art. He was no longer bound by the expectations of Parisian society or trapped by the weight of public opinion. The unpretentious simplicity of the village loosened the grip of doubt, reigniting his confidence and freeing him to create on his own terms. In this overlooked corner of the Mediterranean, Matisse found his muse, his sanctuary, and, ultimately, his transformation.
Not long after, he settled permanently in nearby Nice, drawn by the same energy that had unlocked his potential in Collioure — a place where he would spend the rest of his days until age 84.
Matisse’s story exemplifies a universal truth: the right environment can unlock potential in ways that talent or ambition alone cannot. It is the fusion of place, purpose, and opportunity that creates the conditions for extraordinary success. Yet finding such a place is only part of the journey. Liberating oneself from the constraints of our current environment — from the doubts, the criticisms, the expectations, and the customs that bind us — is often the greater challenge. To do so requires stunning independence and personal leadership.
Matisse left Paris at age 36 a struggling artist. He returned three months later transformed — his confidence renewed, his technique revolutionized, and his reputation on the rise.
Within a season, he had become a rival to Picasso. Collioure was more than a village; it was the point where talent and opportunity converged, where greatness and place became inseparable. Collioure, then, was not just a haven — it was Matisse’s Thrive Zone.

There are places so legendary that we all make a story about them without even experiencing them in reality. We see them in photos, make movies about them, and we can name their main sights just by catching a glimpse of them. And all of these, without putting a foot on their ground.
One of these places is, naturally, Paris. When I think of Paris, I hear Edith Piaf singing about “La Vie en Rose.” I sense the scent of freshly baked croissants and Chanel 5, and I see myself wearing a scarf near the Eiffel Tower on a rainy spring afternoon. This is my screenplay after watching too many French movies as a child.
If I had been born years after, Emily and her perception of Paris would probably have influenced my imagined memories, and I’m not sure this is real.
The French say Paris isn’t that authentic France; it’s dirty, crowded, and expensive — not that the rest of France isn’t, I might add.
Still, I discovered my Paris on a different note. First of all, it wasn’t love at first sight. Oh, not at all. It was that feeling when finally meeting after years and years an old clandestine lover. Even if he lost some of his rich hair and wasn’t that young anymore, that spark that brought the lovers together didn’t fade despite the odd circumstances.

Paris — the city that has inspired poets, artists, and dreamers for centuries. During my recent 3-day trip to this enchanting metropolis, I found myself swept away not only by its breathtaking landmarks and rich history but also by the subtle yet fascinating retail trends that reflect the Parisian way of life. From cobblestone streets lined with boutiques to bustling markets showcasing local craftsmanship, Paris offers a perfect blend of tradition and modernity.
In this article, I’ll take you through my 3-day itinerary while highlighting the travel insights and retail observations I made along the way. Whether you’re planning a trip to Paris or simply curious about the city’s evolving trends, this guide will give you a taste of what makes Paris so timeless — and yet so contemporary.
My journey began in Montmartre, the bohemian heart of Paris. This historic district, perched on a hill overlooking the city, is a haven for artists and romantics alike. Walking through its winding streets felt like stepping into a painting.
Montmartre is home to an eclectic mix of vintage shops and contemporary boutiques. What stood out to me was how these stores seamlessly blend old-world charm with modern sensibilities. From retro-inspired dresses to handmade jewelries, Montmartre’s retail scene celebrates individuality — a hallmark of French fashion.
If Day 1 was about soaking in Montmartre’s artistic vibe, Day 2 was all about exploring Paris’s iconic landmarks and indulging in its culinary delights.
The Latin Quarter offers a treasure trove of independent bookstores (like Shakespeare & Company) and artisan shops selling everything from handmade soaps to custom stationery. What struck me most was how these small businesses prioritise authenticity and quality over mass production — a trend that seems to resonate deeply with both locals and tourists.
For my final day in Paris, I ventured beyond the city centre to explore some royal grandeur and hidden gems that added new dimensions to my understanding of Parisian culture.
The Marais district stood out for its diversity — it’s where high-end fashion boutiques coexist with vintage stores and quirky concept shops. This juxtaposition reflects a broader trend in Parisian retail culture: catering to diverse tastes while maintaining an emphasis on quality and craftsmanship.
As someone who loves observing cultural nuances through shopping experiences, I couldn’t help but notice some key retail trends during my trip:

In my opinion, most restaurants in the world would qualify as good not great, and very few are truly excellent. When I travel, I put in hours of research to try to find the great and excellent restaurants. Luckily, there are plenty of amazing options in Paris. I always wish I had more days and more stomach space to continue exploring. While I was happy with most of my picks from my recent trips in 2024 and 2023, some were clear misses. Of course you never know when a restaurant is having an off day or if you ordered the wrong things or if you were just too full or too tired to really appreciate it. Since I’ve only been to most of these places one time, I would not completely write off any of them if you hear good things from someone else. However, I will personally not be returning to the ones I say to skip!

We came to France to visit Nantes, where my son lives. But I would love to travel to Paris too, so we will stay here for two days and then go to Nantes. We must stop in Paris and taste it again. But we end up in a food coma. We are going to cram Paris in just two days. But this time around, I found something unexpected.
The skies were clear as we landed at Charles de Gaulle airport. Our United flight 990 was unexpectedly impressive. They fed us terrible food the entire time, but the staff was friendly. Get a cab to town next; don’t take the Metro with all your heavy bags after the long trip. We did that once and deeply regretted it. Make sure you find the official ones, which are found at sortie 24. Don’t fall for the gypsies.
We rented an Air B&B in Le Marais at Rue Vielles de Temple. Usually, the pictures look better, but this one was the exact opposite. If you rent an Air B&B when you travel to Paris, remember to arrange for the owner to meet at the door because, unlike in the United States, you can’t just get there, get a code, and get in. In most cases.
After settling in the apartment, we walked through Le Marais. It was quite an experience because you find yourself in a different world, and the contrast back home gives you a buzz…

Yesterday I went across Paris with a driver called Abderrazak. I had to go from Paris Orly airport all the way to Charles de Gaulle on the other side of the city, where the international airport is located and stay overnight before taking our Cathay Pacific flight back to Hong Kong.
My daughters fell asleep after a long day travelling from the Canary Islands, so I started to chat with the stranger in command. I am usually guilty of pulling out my iPhone every time I have a break but this time, I decided to live in the real world, and leave my digital life in my pocket.
I found out Abde was born in Paris to Algerian parents who emigrated from Oran to France for a better life, like many others in the 60’s, once the French occupation of Algeria ended.
Although he feels French and has only been to Algeria on holidays, he said people are not satisfied when he says he is French.
Even though his passport says his place of birth is Roissy (in Paris), his darker look and Arab name raise suspicious eyebrows.

I’m sitting at the Air France Lounge at Charles De Gaulle, pulling down episode two of Studio 60 over the wi-fi so I can watch it on the flight back, and figured I’d do a little blogging while I’m at it. I’ve been in Paris the past two days to do a speech for Disney, which means, of course, that I fly all the way from New York to Paris and then I’m immediately taken to Paris Disneyland, where they’ve put me up in the “New York” hotel. Of all the Baudrillardian ironies…
I’ve done a lot of these two day trips to foreign cities in recent years: Lisbon, Hong Kong, Paris, Hamburg, Amsterdam, London many times. They can be a little exhausting, but I’ve grown fond of the routine. There’s no time to actually try to see anything systematically, no time even to really acclimate to the place. So I basically just try to take a half day and evening, and just walk around with no real destination, letting the natural flow of the city direct me. In cities that I know quite well, like London or Paris, the fun of it is in figuring out the limits of my knowledge, in others it’s more of a process of discovery. And I always try to have some new music that I’ve just downloaded, to listen to on the iPod as a soundtrack. It embeds this lovely — and enduring — connection between the music and the memory of a place…
But enough about all that — SARAH JESSICA PARKER is sitting right next to me in the Lounge!! Does Gawker have a Paris edition?

Over two decades, I’ve reviewed more books about France than any non-English speaking country. So, I suspect, have most critics.
Writers were heading for the cafés and boulevards of Paris more than a century before Snoop Dogg carried the Olympic torch through the streets of the City of Light, and literature is the richer for it.
James Baldwin went there to escape American racism. Ernest Hemingway arrived as a correspondent for the Toronto Daily Star. Edith Wharton first visited the city as child and eventually felt so at home that she spent the last three decades of her life there. She explained the allure of Paris with a line that translates to, “I have it in my blood.”
So many writers have had the same blood disease that the city has inspired good books in a vast number of genres of fiction and nonfiction for adults or children. The abundance could make you say: Mon Dieu!
Where do you start looking for one?
Other critics might urge you to begin with a masterwork. But I never finished Proust’s In Search of Lost Time after…

Paris in the rain is glorious, especially if the rain isn’t hard and unrelenting. My wife Gaywynn and I were in Paris, staying in the 16th arrondissement at our friend Philippe’s grand apartment in May. Philippe’s place is on the rue Raynouard, not far from the Seine, within walking distance of Trocadéro. We stayed a week. We stayed long enough so that we fell into a kind of domestic routine. That included shopping for food. It’s a lovely way to experience Paris, and we were grateful.
Some days it rained. It never stopped us.
Philippe walked us around his neighborhood, showed us where he shopped for food, greeting all the shop owners who clearly knew him. Later, we followed in his footsteps. We cooked a few meals for Philippe, and so we needed to buy food.
We did our shopping mainly on the rue de l‘Annonciation, a narrow pedestrian street that flows into the broader, longer rue de Passy. We walked it many times, up and back, passing by all those shops and stores that truly sustain a neighborhood — butcher, produce, wine, bakery, seafood. Each is its own world, pulsing with tradition and high standards. Paris is a city of shops. (How many cities do you know still are?) They give you intimacy. They individualize you.
Sometimes, we would eat at Aéro, a brasserie at the end of rue de l‘Annonciation on the Place de Passy, where we could sit outside. We came to think of it as our brasserie. That’s what happens when you stay for a while in Paris. You find a place to call your own. You make an attachment to it. It belongs to you, and you belong to it.
After a week, we belonged to our neighborhood and to Paris.
We bought meat at Les Bouchers Doubles at 43 rue de l’Annonciation. We bought vegetables at Marché Couvert de Passy. We bought pastries at Aux Merveilleux de Fred — yes, I know, “Fred” doesn’t sound French — and bread at Aux Pains de Manon, both on rue de l’Annonciation. Did any of the people behind the counters recognize us by the end of the week? I’d like to think, or to pretend, they did. They always smiled, in any case.
Some days we went to Monoprix, a store I like very much. The name, Monoprox, is not very romantic. It’s a practical place, with a practical name, and I always feel practical shopping there. You don’t shop at Monoprix for souvenirs, but you do find things you need. For splendor, Gaywynn and I went to La Grande Épicerie de Paris on rue de Passy, where we found the best France has to offer. It was amazing to see what they considered exotic produce from America — they sold Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, for example.
It rained several days while we were there. I never minded. I think rain brings out a stunning aspect of Paris. It makes the city moody, and me as well. I feel I’m a poet when I walk rainy Paris. Rain is disparaged too much, more than it should be. People talk about rain as if it were some kind of setback. It’s rain. That’s all. You can get wet. It’s all worth it when the rain is falling in Paris, and the gray light makes everything the best black and white film you’ve ever seen, and you smell the damp air and hear car tires hissing on the wet streets.
I think you can be a citizen of Paris by right of passion.
When it rained, we might dart into the Librairie Fontaine, a sweet bookstore on rue de l‘Annonciation. We discovered one of the young employees, who spoke flawless French, was American. I’d never heard any American speak French as well as he did. What I wouldn’t give to be able to work in a French bookstore! Well, here’s to reincarnation.
I speak French passably. If a Parisian speaks, as they do sometimes, at the speed of light, then I’m lost. If the conversation is at a reasonable clip, though, and it’s just the two of us, I can manage. Speaking a language not your own and that you don’t speak fluently is a lesson in humility and error. But when you speak French in Paris and are understood, that’s a chest-rising feeling. So, I jump in. I never mind being clumsy. They’re not going to report me.
Returning after a long day on the Left Bank, we walked from our Métro station, Passy, up the long hill to rue de Passy. We didn’t have the climbing energy the students who disembarked with us had. Never mind. There was Desgranges bakery waiting at the top, on rue de Passy, with something weight-increasing, but God did it taste good. That gave us the motivation we needed.
Then home to rue Raynouard, into the small, slowly-rising elevator, off at our floor, inserting the key Philippe had given us, opening the door, throwing ourselves onto his couch, restoring ourselves, and then ready, in a while, to venture out again.
Our corner of Paris. It’s in our heart.

“Don’t come to Paris if you can’t speak French, they will ignore you right away”
“Don’t you ever speak English in Paris, they’ll be mad, trust me”
As an English Education student, those sayings always overwhelmed me whenever I wanted to go to Paris. Well, as an English Education Student, it is my basic talent to at least speak and communicate with people using the English Language. However, I am always curious about those sayings. Is it actually true? That Parisians hate people who speak English? Will they get mad at you? or will they be harsh on you?
Here are some facts that you need to know about English in Paris based on my experience as a Student Exchange of a short course program at SciencesPo, Paris, France.
Parisians have high nationalism about their country
When I arrived in Paris for the first time, there was a man who communicated with me and talked about politics after a piece of news came from a television in a lobby hotel. He talked about how he disagreed with the new American president. He said that it is such a shame that people don’t actually use their rights to vote for the right president.
At first, I was shocked when I heard his story about politics all of sudden as soon as I arrived at my hotel. Second, I was shocked because he literally used English directly to talk with me. Third, it turns out he didn’t even care to talk about such things even though I am a hijabi, since I heard that some Parisians are Islamophobic.
Lots of questions in my head right after 5 minutes I arrived. Yet, as a Gen Z, me and my curiosity couldn’t even stand to ask those questions to the man.
So I asked him,
“Wait sir, before we continue, I am actually amazed, because however, you are French, and you are talking to me in English, it’s just…you know...I often heard Parisians hate tourists, especially people who speak English. Then how do you just naturally speak English right away?”
Then, he answered
Haha, it’s funny because however, it’s not actually 100% correct. Do some French speak English? yes. But do they hate it? well not all of them. You know what, we actually not that bad.
Since it’s not answering all of my questions, I asked him once again.
Okay, got it, so it’s only a stereotype right? but why do “some” of them hate it? I mean what is wrong with using English in Paris? and one more question, Do Parisian hate Muslims? Because i am a hijabi and to be honest i am afraid that people will don’t like my hijab sir.
He smiled and said,
You know what young lady, we are not that bad once again. I mean, yea some of us still hate people who don’t “act” like us. Why? it’s because we do realize how hard we achieve our condition to be independent and win the war. We’ve come this far, then,
“how come people use another language in our country?”
“don’t they be proud of our language? why they use another language if they came here?”
Back then, let me tell you that we are so open to people. For example, Chinese. We always welcome tourist whocame. But day by day it seems that they “try” to domain the land. They start to sell their products, feels like they want to conquer our land. That’s why, perhaps, not all French are friendly when they saw another people. Especially if it seems that they try to domain the land.
I was amazed, mesmerized by his answer, and nod right away.
French people have high nationalism towards their country. I did realize it after I came to Arc de Triomphe on November, 11th 2024. When it’s a day of remembrance. This day commemorates the armistice that ended World War I, signed between the Allies and Germany in Compiègne, France on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. Since 2012, the day has also served as a remembrance for all of France’s war dead.
Under the Arc de Triomphe, there is a Rekindling of the Flame. This ceremony takes place every evening at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The Flame Committee rekindles the Flame of Remembrance to honor the soldiers who died in World War I and other conflicts. The remains of an unknown soldier are buried beneath the Arc de Triomphe. The tomb features an eternal flame that burns in memory of the soldiers who died in both world wars.
On that day, they also raise a giant flag in the middle of the Arc de Triomphe
When I went there, I was amazed by how people mourn and truly remember the history behind it. All of them gather and give some flowers and respect those who died in honor back then. Then I realized that Paris, indeed, is a city full of history.
In a nutshell? English in Paris, is it a friend or foe? I can loudly say that it is actually a friend. When I was there I literally used 90% English and 10% messy French. Yet, most of them still smiling and answering my questions.
However, here are some tips and tricks if you want to speak English safely in Paris.
Most Parisians will appreciate how you say something if you add some French to it! Even though it is as simple as “merci”. I usually use “excusez-moi” and “je ne parle français, je parle anglais” which means “Excuse me, I can’t speak french, I can speak English”. After that, they will usually say that my French accent is good even though I said that I can’t speak French. Then they will also try to answer my questions in English since it seems like I have the intention to ask my questions in their language even though I can’t.
2. Keep smiling no matter what
As what “the man” said in my previous story, it is obvious that all people will welcome your English. So, keep smiling no matter what, so that they realize you already tried your best to ask something in French.
3. “Bonjour” and “Merci” is the key
Every time you want to ask something to someone in English. Always remember to say at least Bonjour and Merci. Especially in the Supermarket. I realize that people in supermarkets like Carrefour mostly are not welcome whenever we use English to communicate with them. Especially in those hectic moments at the cashier. I think they are just too tired to talk more in English. That’s why, you could encourage them to talk with you by at least, saying “bonjour” and “merci”.
And those are some tips and tricks to survive with your English in Paris! Trust me, Paris is not that bad for tourists. I mean, France has the highest number of tourists from all over the world. If I can describe it in a sentence, I would say that Paris is such a beautiful, magical, and endearing city. So, come to Paris and feel the atmosphere of love and historical value from the architecture. Trust me, you won’t regret it.
enchanté Paris! Merci!

Last Thursday, April 3, my family and I got dressed in historically-inspired formal wear and headed off to The Buckland Club’s Siege of Paris dinner.
The dinner was over a year in the making, and I’m still so proud, honored, and amazed to say that I’ve been involved from nearly the start of it.
In March 2024, I was contacted by Andrew Morris, Chairman of The Buckland Club, a club that meets twice every year in Birmingham, England, for unusual themed dinners. Named for Frank Buckland, a 19th century British naturalist who famously ate countless different kinds of animals, their motto is Semper in ventrem aliquid novi. (Always something new in the stomach.).
Andrew explained that the theme of the Club’s spring 2025 dinner would be the Siege of Paris, and he wanted to know if I’d like to be its sponsor.
The role wasn’t a financial one (much to my relief — my love of the Siege of Paris is boundless, but alas, my budget is not), but rather more like an organizer and lecturer. I would help plan the menu (including, I’d find out, the images on the actual paper menus and place mats), and then, on the night of the dinner, I’d discuss each course and the history behind it in 5–7 minutes in front of a hungry and curious crowd.
I was very honored — and all in. I loved the idea of bringing food from the Siege to life…even though it was notoriously terrible.
That, though, Andrew explained to me, was exactly why The Buckland Club’s members wanted to try it out.
Over the past year, Andrew, as well as Club president Roger Hale and deputy chair Hazel Riggall, have been frequent online companions. We’ve spent hours discussing things like how to acquire edible and ethically sourced zoo animals to eat, the history of Parisian bread, and the availability of potatoes and cheese during the Siege.
As you might imagine, I was thrilled to be able to talk about and dissect (no pun intended) these topics. And it was always such a pleasure to receive their friendly and curious messages, and to see them “live” on Zoom calls.
We had some challenges along the way, just as you would with any major undertaking. For instance, Roger, who does the page layout for the Club’s menus, needed a more high-definition copy of the Café Voisin menu from the Siege. Luckily, we were able to reach out to the Musée Escoffier, who has an original copy and very kindly sent us an actual photo of it.
There were also long email exchanges about the bread. If you read this blog, you probably know I’m a tiny bit obsessed with Siege bread, to say the least. When white flour ran out during the Siege, bread was made with ingredients like potato flakes, crushed peas, and even straw. Intrepid bread makers Roger and Hazel were able to come up with several variations of Siege bread, based on contemporary accounts we have of it. But most of it had to be edible…more edible, that is, than actual Siege bread, which notoriously caused indigestion and was so horrible that pieces of it were saved as souvenirs of the hardship Parisians endured during the Siege.
That kind of adaptation sums up what the dinner became. On the one hand, the members of The Buckland Club are boundlessly curious and open-minded when it comes to food. But on the other hand, we didn’t want anyone to leave the dinner hungry or sick. So, some compromises were made.
In the end, the dinner ended up being a wonderful, Siege-inspired affair. And while each course may not have been an exact replica of what someone would have eaten during this time, it was an intriguing jumping-off point for me to discuss during my speeches and a very cool homage to that era.
The Buckland Club members were attentive and enthusiastic listeners, which truly warmed my heart and made the evening even more fun. And they’re just great people in general. It was an unforgettable experience.
If you’re curious about what exactly we ate, here’s a breakdown of the menu (with photos of each course).
The paper menus and place mats
Okay, these weren’t edible parts of the Siege of Paris dinner, but they were definitely important. Roger Hale had asked me to send him images I thought would illustrate the Siege and our particular dinner. We had limited space, so it was a challenge, but in the end, I sent him:
~ one of my favorite cartoons from that time, an illustration by Cham of a man at a dinner table who’s just had a cat jump down his throat. The French caption translates to: “The risk of eating mice is that your cat might chase after them.”
~ a drawing of a line in front of a Municipal Butcher’s. Parisians would redeem their increasingly meager meat (or, as the Siege continued, dried fish) rations here. Sometimes, supplies would run out and the people would complain and even try to storm the butcher’s, hence the presence of members of the National Guard. Getting your ration often meant queuing for hours during a winter with record-breaking cold temperatures.
~ a drawing of one of the city’s infamous cat, dog, and rat butcher stands. These animals, along with horses, were the main sources of meat for Parisians, outside their small ration from the municipal butchers (if the ration was still available and they were able to brave hours-long lines and freezing temperatures).
~ another cartoon by Cham, of a well-dressed man holding a loaf of bread beneath his arm as he walks along the street. This was from a moment fairly early in the Siege where non-government bakeries or possibly one’s own kitchen could still provide white-flour loaves. People were being asked to bring their own bread to restaurants, and having your fine white flour bread was a status symbol.
~ a photo of one of my Siege of Paris bread souvenirs.
~ a famous image and relic from the Siege: The December 25, 1870 menu from the Café Voisin, which, like many Parisian restaurants, still operated during the Siege, though their offerings had to be adapted based on what food was available. Sometimes, restaurants showed a sense of honesty and humor, as in this case. Among other Siege-era offerings, you’ll find “Le Chat flanqué de rats” (cat flanked by rats), as well as meat from zoo animals. This menu was also one of the main sources of inspiration for our Siege of Paris dinner.
~ one of the cover images from Album du siège par Cham et Daumier, a collection of cartoons by Cham and Daumier that cover the experience of the Siege. This particular image shows an allegorical representation of Paris (recognizeable by both her tower crown and the convenient word “Paris” written on it) eagerly gathering rats into her mouth while surrounded by a pot with a dog and a cat in it.
Roger also added photos of the Siege bread-inspired loaves he and Hazel had made for the dinner, on a special insert page that featured my translations of some of the contemporary accounts and recipes we have for Siege bread.
I can’t tell you how moved I was when I came into the dining room at the Edgbaston Golf Club and saw those place settings with these familiar and beloved illustrations. It felt like a real way to honor the people who experienced the Siege of Paris, and to celebrate their humor and resilience. Everything also just looked really great.
I felt blown away, as you can see from the expression on my face in this photo, which my son snapped just as we sat down.
Canapés
But I’m getting a bit ahead of myself, because we didn’t enter the dining room right away. First, there were drinks and canapés.
The drinks ranged from water to alcohol, which were all available during the Siege. There wasn’t Coke at the time, but my son was still happy to be offered a glass, and hey, other kinds of sugary treats were also usually easily obtainable during the Siege, including chocolate and jam.
The canapés themselves consisted of scoops of sardine pâté with a slice of radish on top. Sardines are included in the Café Voisin’s menu, but were likely canned or dried. We had discussed using some kind of dried fish, which was what was mostly available during the Siege. In fact, towards the end of it, many municipal butcher’s had run out of meat and were giving out dried cod instead. But that would have been a bit tricky to eat.
The radish slice was inspired by the Café Voisin menu, where radishes are listed among the hors d’oeuvres. Vegetables were hard to come by during the Siege, since no one had been prepared to stockpile those that might last, and since the bitterly cold autumn and winter wasn’t the best time to grow anything. And yet, some Parisians or refugees from nearby suburbs did have small gardens or small stockpiles of vegetables from before the Siege. Some of them cultivated gardens just outside the city wall, or might even have ventured back to their evacuated suburban homes to see what they could gather (if the place hadn’t been looted already). Others, including restaurant owners, may have procured vegetables from the black market.
So, while not every Parisian was regularly enjoying vegetables, it was possible, especially for the clientele of an upscale restaurant like the Café Voisin, who had different ways of obtaining them, from possibly growing them or relying on their own stock, to paying exorbitant prices for them legally or through black market sellers.
The canapés were served on modern-day Siege bread. This was made by Roger and Hazel, based on recipes and accounts from the Siege, including:
“One pound of this bread contains: An eighth of common wheat flour, 4/8 of a mixture of potato flakes, rice, lentils, split peas, vetches, oats, and rye ground up in abnormal portions, 2/8 of water, 1/8 of straw and vegetable shell remains.” — Jacques-Henri Paradis, in his memoir Journal du siège, par un bourgeois de Paris (my translation)
and
“It seems to have been made with old panama hats picked up out of the gutters.” — courtesy of the often sassy chronicler Henri d’Alméras (my translation)
Hazel’s bread contained Siege-inspired ingredients including rye flour, chickpea flour, and pea flour. Roger created two versions of Siege bread. The first contains ingredients like dried and pounded potato peelings, green and red lentils, buckwheat flour, and rice flour.
The second version of Roger’s bread contained actual straw.
As you can imagine, as someone sort of obsessed with Siege bread, I couldn’t wait to try these. While the sardine pâté stole the show in terms of flavor, I was thrilled to detect little rough, grainy bits in the bread.
Unfortunately, none of these bits were straw. The Club had decided not to serve Roger’s Siege bread batch that contained straw, although some members had tried it during a tasting a few weeks prior. The general consensus of those I talked to was that it lived up to its reputation and was hard to eat. One Club member told me she was still picking bits of straw out of her teeth!
That said, another member pulled me aside towards the end of the evening and confessed that he didn’t think the straw bread was that bad and that if he were ever in a Siege of Paris situation, he’d be fine with the bread.
While I was glad Roger had made it and that some people had actually tasted it and could tell me about it, I have to admit, I was disappointed that I wouldn’t get to experience the straw Siege bread myself. Not even to taste, per se — one of the things we’d all discussed was possibly leaving a small slice of it by each place setting with the option of either tasting it or saving it as a souvenir. But it turns out there wasn’t enough of the straw bread for all 60+ attendees.
Luckily, there would be a surprise for me a little later…..
First Course: Onion Soup without the Onion, and another version of Siege bread
A basket of bread inspired by Siege recipes was on every table for the first course. This bread had been baked by the kitchen staff of the Edgbaston Golf Club, led by Head Chef Chris Haynes. Everyone I met who worked at the Edgbaston Golf Club was kind and amazing. I’m so grateful for their help and to Chris and his team for being so open to making all of these unusual dishes. I can’t thank them enough.
Their version of the bread was more edible and went down smoothly. I think it could have absolutely been served at a regular dinner without raising an eyebrow, and for that, I’m sure our guests were grateful.
As for the soup, the name was inspired by an actual recipe in La Cuisinière assiégée, ou L’art de vivre en temps de siége (The Besieged Cook, or art de vivre in times of siege), a cookbook anonymously published near the end of the Siege or shortly after. The book contains recipes for homemakers and, understandably, focuses a lot on replacing or simply doing without certain ingredients.
Onion soup without the onion has always made me smile a bit. The description is at once practical and honest, and a bit funny — very much in keeping with the sense of grim humor we see in things like the cartoons published during the Siege or on restaurant menus that openly describe the unusual animals they’re serving, rather than being discreet about it (say, by calling cat “rabbit” or simply listing stew, not its ingredients).
The recipe itself, though, isn’t just a joke. It’s an actual option for someone with few ingredients available to them (the book also contains an actual onion soup recipe, if the cook was able to get their hands on an onion or two).
Here’s the recipe for Onion Soup without the Onion, from La Cuisinière assiégée (my translation):
“Melt fat into a frying pain; take slices of bread, that you will toast for a long time; add the necessary amount of water, salt, and pour it over your slices of bread.”
Andrew and I toyed with the idea of actually serving this soup. But seeing that it was a paid dinner and that we didn’t want Club members to actually starve, Andrew came up with a different solution: Why not make a traditional French onion soup and then explain all of the ingredients, including cheese, normal bread, and actual onions, that would not have been in this recipe or have been easily available to most Parisians?
So, that’s what we did.
Although the part of me that longs for authenticity was a bit disappointed, the soup lifted my spirits. I’m actually not a big fan of French onion soup, but this one was seasoned in a way that just really clicked with me. I thoroughly enjoyed it and am glad to have tasted it, regardless of the context.
It was also a fun and unique approach to give my speech about this course and have everyone imagine each of its crucial ingredients missing. I think everyone felt grateful to not be eating onion soup during the Siege.
Main Course: Civet de Kangourou (Kangaroo Stew), Petits-Pois au Beurre (peas in butter), Boiled Potatoes
Our main course was one of the biggest decisions we had to make. Namely, what meat should we choose? Naturally, when you think of the Siege of Paris, meat sources like cat, dog, and, especially, rat, come to mind. But none of us wanted to eat cat or dog (or legally could have in the UK, for that matter).
It turns out that Andrew has tried dog before, during a trip to North Korea, and he could confirm that, as many Siege -era accounts claim, it tastes a bit like mutton. I’ve also heard testimonials by an Italian man who, during World War II, ate cat and said that, as Siege-era Parisians often claimed, it tastes like rabbit.
I haven’t heard much about what rat tasted like, but when you think about it, some cultures do eat other kinds of rodents — for instance, guinea pig in several South American countries, so it must be pretty tasty.
There was some discussion among club members about possibly procuring rat in some way, or replacing it with a similar rodent. But to be honest, that sort of sat heavily with me. I genuinely like rats, as you may know, and felt a bit sad about the prospect of eating one. Luckily, the idea was quickly shot down, since the Club had recently had a dinner where rodents were served and didn’t want to repeat themselves. The same went for horses, another fairly common meat source during the Siege.
When Andrew then suggested pigeon, which people do indeed eat today and would probably be fairly easy to get our hands on, I realized I had truly become immersed in the Siege of Paris, because I felt horrified.
Not just because I also really love pigeons and believe that if I were reincarnated as a bird, that’s what I would be, but because pigeons were considered heroes during the Siege of Paris.
In a city cut off from the world, they were the only way for people to get messages from outside the city walls, through a roll of microfilm inserted into a metal tube attached to a pigeon’s feathers. Although not every homing pigeon made it back to Paris safely, those who did were able to get more than 100, 000 messages to isolated, worried Parisians. That’s why when you look at many images commemorating the Siege, you’ll often see drawings of pigeons included. They were even included on Bartholdi’s monument to the Siege’s balloonists that stood at Porte des Ternes, before it was melted down in World War II.
Not every pigeon in Paris in 1870 and 1871 was a homing pigeon, of course, but they were all respected, because you never knew.
I’m sure some people still ate pigeons — in fact, a Siege memoir by Charles Laurent claims that some people counted their tail feathers to determine whether or not they were homing pigeons in order to try to catch and eat those who weren’t. But even so, this wasn’t something that was accepted or proclaimed or joked about the same way eating just about any other animal was at the time.
So, pigeon was also ruled out for our menu (much to my secret relief).
In the end, we opted to go upscale and choose kangaroo, an animal that is still eaten today and is available in the UK. This wasn’t much of a compromise, though, since civet de kangourou (kangaroo stew) is an actual item on the Café Voisin menu.
Zoo animals from the Jardin des Plantes and the Jardin d’Acclimation, which was located just outside the city and whose animal population had to be relocated to the Jardin des Plantes, unfortunately weren’t able to be fed for very long after the Siege started. In order to keep them from suffering and dying a slow death from starvation, the zookeepers made an arrangement to sell most of the animals, either exclusively or primarily to the upscale Boucherie Anglaise (English Butcher’s, appropriately enough for the location of our dinner).
These animals could be sold freshly butchered or canned, and they came at a high price, which means most Parisians never got to taste them. But some more privileged ones did, including Victor Hugo, who wrote about eating elephant in his memoirs of the Siege.
Although the menus that offered zoo animals were often honest or humorous about it, many Parisians had a bit of melancholy, especially about eating elephant, since two of those elephants were Castor and Pollux, beloved animals who children used to ride at the zoo. The accounts of their deaths are among the most heartbreaking things I’ve ever read about the Siege.
In addition to elephant consommé and kangaroo stew, you’ll find other zoo animal offerings on the Café Voisin menu, including wolf, which Andrew very cleverly also “included” in our Siege of Paris dinner menu by serving his favorite wines, fittingly called Le Loup Blanc (The White Wolf) and L’Espirt du Loup (The Spirit of the Wolf).
As for our kangaroo stew, I was intrigued to try it (and trying hard not to think about how cool kangaroos are — after all, I eat pigs and cows all the time, and those animals are pretty cool in their own right, too). So was my son. One thing I admire about him is that while he can be a picky eater (for instance, despite being half-French, he did not want the melted Gruyere cheese in his French onion soup), he’s also an intrepid one. He’ll try almost anything, even if he’s not guaranteed to like it.
He had been talking about tasting kangaroo for weeks (maybe it’s a good thing that, unlike me when I was a kid, he’s not too into nature documentaries that feature them), and when the time came, he wasn’t disappointed. He described it as tasting like duck, and said “Mom, you’re going to love this!” as he enthusiastically took another bite.
Andrew was impressed by his comparison, which made me feel better about my son being there. There had been some debate about Edgbaston Golf Club’s policy, since they don’t usually allow children. But since the dinner was a private event, the Buckland Club advocated for us and my son was able to come and taste kangaroo and take lots of pictures of me and wear a suit and thin bowtie inspired by Napoleon III’s son Louis-Napoleon, who my son kind of looks like in one particular photo.
And so, Andrew announced at the dinner, my son is as of now the youngest person to attend a Buckland Club dinner, in all the Club’s 73-year history! I’m so grateful to Andrew for advocating for him, and to my son for behaving as well as I knew he would, and I’m glad he liked the food, too.
(My husband was also there, thrilled to wear a replica Civil War Union military jacket he’d gotten years ago as a gift from his American in-laws. I said if anyone asked him, he should tell them it was in homage to Wickham Hoffman, a former Civil War colonel who came to Paris and was American Ambassador Elihu Washburn’s secretary during the Siege. Both men’s diaries and/or memoirs happen to have been valuable sources to me when I was writing Hearts at Dawn, so everything tied nicely together.)
Sorry for hopping to another topic — back to the kangaroo. Although my son said it tasted like duck, we realized that was because he’s never tasted venison. But those of us who had, thought that it was a bit closer to that. It had a soft, pleasant, but slightly stringy texture that reminded me of brisket. Overall, a very good meal and one of the highlights.
The kangaroo stew served at the dinner was a sort of deconstructed version of the dish, which had probably been cooked along with the vegetables in the original version, both due to French tradition and probably the fact that this would have hidden the condition of some of the vegetables, which might not have been great-looking or could have been a bit wilted (for any leafy veggies or herbs that might have been included) at this point in the Siege.
Both peas and potatoes were somewhat available during the Siege. Petits pois au beurre — peas in butter — is even on the Café Voisin menu, although I’ve always been curious about the butter. From Berte Ainé , chef at another upscale restaurant, Peter’s, book Les menus d’un restaurant de Paris durant le siège, I know that dairy products could sometimes be procured via the black market (Ainé writes about a man who keeps milk-producing goats hidden in a barn or warehouse, for instance), but I do wonder if there were other places it was produced and sold, maybe legally? I want to do more research into this.
As for potatoes, you’ll sometimes come across them in menus or recipes from the time, but they were also fairly rare, at least rare enough for a sack of them to have been one of the items auctioned off at the Fête de la Charité, a charity event held in late December, around the time the Café Voisin menu was being served.
I haven’t come across many accounts about carrots in particular during the Siege, but they are listed, for instance, in the items and prices section of La Cuisinière assiégée. And they did taste really nice with the kangaroo….
Dessert: Cream of Rice, Coffee Served With Oat Milk
Although I don’t tend to like things like cream of rice, I was very excited to try this version, since it came from a Siege recipe I’d actually tried to make — and very, very badly failed at.
In December 2022, I tried my hand and making the cream of rice recipe included in La Cuisinière Assiégée. The recipe was challenging because there are no exact measurements or amounts of ingredients given, and instructions are cursory. My rice pudding ended up looking (and tasting) like just a pile of white rice with chocolate powder over it.
My blog post about my failed attempt at making crème de riz (cream of rice) was actually how Andrew found me in the first place, so while I didn’t get an edible dessert out of it, I got something so much better.
As I blogged at the time, I have no idea what the actual result of the recipe would have looked like at the time. Maybe this would have been close? Probably not, though, especially according to my French husband, who’s since re-read my blog post and the recipe and thinks there are a few things I should have done differently. We’re actually planning to try the recipe his way soon. I’ll report back on that when it happens.
As for the cream of rice served at the Siege of Paris dinner, it looked worlds away from what I’d made (which is a good thing). It was rich and creamy and comforting, which I’m not sure the original was — but again, I have no way of knowing for sure.
The one thing everyone noted about this one, though, was that you could still feel the rice grains. I don’t know if that has to do with the swap of oat milk (dairy milk was almost non-existent during the Siege, and the recipe calls for essentially making your own oat milk) or some other issue. Whatever the case, most Club members emptied their bowls. My son, who’s usually picky about texture, also really enjoyed it. So at the very least, at least dessert was good.
There was also coffee, which was available during the Siege, but in keeping with the Siege’s hardships, it was served with oat milk. (Sugar was also available for those who wanted it, since it wasn’t scarce during the Siege.)
The evening finished off with my final speech, as well as closing statements from Andrew, and absinthe for those who wanted it. Although absinthe is more associated with the Belle Epoque, it’s been around since at least the early 1800’s and was available during the Siege. My husband and I didn’t partake (nor did my son, I promise), but it was an interesting way to end the evening’s menu.
One of the best gifts ever
But the most amazing food-related conclusion of the evening came to me in the form of a gift. Towards the end of the meal, Andrew handed me a gift from him, Hazel, and Roger (in addition to a gift from the latter two, who had also incredibly kindly surprised me with a letter from January 1870), as well as the rest of the Club.
I opened it to find what is honestly one of the most thoughtful presents I’ve ever received, from anyone.
They had taken a small slice of Roger’s bread that had been made with the straw and mounted it onto a typed card — essentially making a modern-day Siege Bread souvenir.
Like most Siege bread souvenirs, the mounted card reads “Souvenir Historique”, but below the piece of bread, the text becomes wonderfully personal, reading:
THE BUCKLAND CLUB
SIEGE OF PARIS DINNER 1870–1871
SPONSOR: ALYSA SALZBERG
On the lower right-hand side is a picture of Frank Buckland. On the right is the Club’s seal and motto, Semper in ventrem aliquid novi. Between both is written:
Edgabaston Golf Club, Birmingham
Thursday 3rd April 2025
Examples of Siege Bread by Roger Hale
Here’s a comparison of a typical 1871 Siege of Paris souvenir shadow box and The Buckland Club’s modern-day Siege bread souvenir:
This gesture absolutely blew me away, and always will. I truly can’t express how moved I am by the thoughtfulness behind it.
My husband, son, and I are recovering from the amazing dinner and also a whirlwind 2-day stay in Birmingham where we used just about every free moment to visit and explore the city (huge shout-out to the surprisingly cool, fun, and fascinating Pen Museum, probably our favorite destination), try its famous Indian food, and take advantage of our sort-of guilty pleasure treat whenever we go to the UK, the Tesco meal deal. But as soon as we’re up and running again, my modern-day bread souvenir will join the 1871 souvenir shadow box on my wall.
I know that every time I look at it, I’ll feel a massive sense of joy, gratitude, and appreciation for everyone involved in this Siege of Paris dinner.
It was an amazing, once-in-lifetime experience to have collaborated on this dinner and have had the opportunity to try these Siege-inspired recipes. But best of all was being in the company of such interesting and truly kind people. I’m relieved that the Siege of Paris dinner went so well, but sad that it’s over. Still, I’ve made some memories — and friends — I’ll never forget.
A HUGE thank you again to Andrew, Hazel, and Roger, and to everyone at the Edgbaston Golf Club and The Buckland Club for this experience. And also for putting up with my Siege bread obsession.

Helping You Adapt to Life in France

“So anyway, that’s part of why I think France has more of a cafe culture than a coffee culture,” I concluded, having just explained how much I appreciated the growth of specialty coffee in Paris.
We were dining outside of the cathedral at Chartres and I was enduring the prison coffee so often served in many otherwise lovely restaurants in France. One of the Baby Boomers in the party heartily disagreed with my sentiment. “I think this is very good coffee,” he sniffed. I wasn’t sure why he felt the need to defend the general state of coffee in France, but I certainly feel no such need, despite loving life here.
The coffee in France in general and in Paris in particular is, at best, average. At worst, it’s dire, reminiscent of the strange brew you would find inside a Shell gas station in America in the late 1980s. No love, no care, just some grounds and hot water. And why have the French been okay with this? Because, as I contend, coffee in this country is, like a cigarette, more of a ritual. It’s about what is going on when you have a coffee, not the quality of the coffee itself. This isn’t to say that the French don’t know good coffee when they taste it. They just aren’t going to go out of their way to find it.

Stories of Vince Duqué’s grand experiment to be his authentic self in Paris after a lifetime of drinking the kool-aid of the American Dream

--
Listen

You can find my first article in this series, when I was three months out from my move to Paris, here.
“Are you excited about Paris yet?”
It’s an innocent enough question.
I’m pacing around my room while on the phone with my friend Anne: “Nope. Not excited one bit. Paris isn’t real until the visa is real,” I deadpan. It is October 7, and I think I’m unofficially five weeks out from my Paris move. I’m still not fully confident I’m actually going to Paris, actually. I haven’t heard news about my visa since I submitted the application back two weeks ago.
I hope Anne didn’t take my answer as a snarky one. 52 year-old me was trying to be like water and quell the anxiety generated last week by my inner child — the eight-year-old version of me — who had been having a series of micro-meltdowns, worried that my visa application was anything but “foolproof,” even though I bleeping spent €1,900 to make it so. I was still a bit raw from my mom’s passing and the end of my relationship with Sarah, as well as all the purging and the anticipation of all the major changes.
“It’s going to happen,” she assures me. I say nothing. I know she means well. “Why do you think you’ll have an issue?” she asks. I tell her what happened at my visa application appointment.
We FLASHBACK to September 27, the visa appointment at the VFS office:
The young clerk at the VFS office (the third-party company designated to pre-process the applications on their way to the French Consulate in Washington D.C) reviews my application and notes that it is incomplete but that she’d send the application anyway, as-is. “Wait, why are you writing that?” I plead.
“It says here on the checklist that since you are starting a business you need these documents, and you don’t have them.”
“I’m not starting a conventional business in Paris,” I say, “so, I don’t need a copy of a commercial lease agreement or proof of a credit balance from an account.” She takes a few moments to process this, but I can tell by her fidgeting that this situation is deviating from her script. This was probably above her pay grade to solve problems any more than a drive-thru clerk taking orders at a fast-food joint where you can’t have it your way. I give her a curious look that means, “Surely, you’ve dealt with other Profession Libérale visa applications in the past.”
“Since you don’t have the paperwork — even if you say you don’t need them — I can’t cross this off the checklist on the computer, so it won’t show that the application is complete,” she says. “So for me to send the application, I need to write a note.”
I want to pull the good ol’ American I’d like to speak to your supervisor, please, but I don’t want the VFS office to spit in my soup and sabotage my chances for approval. I bite my tongue instead, and tell eight-year-old me, “we’re going to have to trust the process.”
“But I walk out of the office with a massive knot in my stomach, “ I told Anne.
“It’s gonna be great,” she reassures me. I roll my eyes, when I notice an email that just popped up in my in-box, entitled: MISSING DOCUMENTS. It’s from the French Consulate.
“I gotta go.” I hang up the phone. My stomach is in knots again.
I close my eyes, take three deep breaths to keep me from going nuclear, and then open the e-mail.
Please provide the following documents in order to complete processing for your visa application:
- Your last 3 months’ bank statements showing your full name and enough funds to pay for your trip and expenses
- Proof of income related to your business activity in France (letter containing draft work contract with remuneration indicated)
- A housing lease or your host’s property deed
Please carefully read the following instructions on how to respond to this email:
- Please scan these documents directly back to this e-mail address in the next 7 days. Send them all in one email.
- Do not send the documents you already provided at your VFS appointment. We have already reviewed those and have deemed them to be insufficient or inadequate. If you send the same documents again, your visa will likely be denied.
- Only send your documents once and please refrain from writing to inquire if we received your documents. Too many e-mails received disrupt the organization of the visa department and result in longer processing times for applications.
Imagining being spoken by a French bureaucrat, I read the e-mail trying not to be annoyed by the surface politeness disguising the indifference, rigidity, vagueness, and trickiness, all of which French bureaucracy was infamous for. Too late.
“Nooooo!” I scream up to the sky. “I paid two grand for a service to deal with this! And now I have seven days to get the right docs!”
I’m livid. I leave the house for some air. I passed by my 95-year-old grandma in the living room reminding myself that I had yet to tell her I was leaving for Paris.
Why was I so incensed? Before I submitted the application back in September, I scheduled a one-hour consultation call with Franceformation to review my application, but in the actual call, she didn’t review or comment on any of the other parts of my visa application except for the business plan. The entire reason I paid her the exorbitant fee sight unseen was for her allegedly expert eyes to ensure my entire application was foolproof from top to bottom, not just the business plan. I emailed her a message expressing my concern. This was her response:
“ Your supporting documents are fine. Your business plan needs some serious work if you would like it to be accepted in a visa application. I would strongly advise against submitting it without taking into account many of the recommendations I made on our call. Please note that the guarantee included with your package is that I would help you revise and review your visa application again if it does not get approved the first time (this has never happened to any of my clients who followed the Complete French Business Incubator process). If you do not take into account any of my recommendations prior to submitting your application, I will not be providing additional feedback if it is rejected.”
As you can see by the Consulate’s e-mail above, they approved my business plan, which to be clear, I revised on the astute suggestions of expats from Facebook and other friends with expert knowledge, NOT incorporating any of Franceformation’s notes, which were similar in tone and expertise to the kind of advice my father gave me as a 13 year-old regarding how to throw a fastball, having only read a library book called The Official Little League Way to Play Baseball and watched baseball on TV but had never actually played baseball, because well, they didn’t have baseball in the Philippines when he was a kid.
Note that Franceformation stated my “supporting documents are fine,” yet based on the Consulate’s email of my MISSING DOCUMENTS, my supporting documents were clearly NOT fine. Even if she was willing to provide additional feedback, based on every single interaction I had with her, odds were quite high that she was not going to put in the work into my documents besides insisting that her advice was correct, which she was/is infamous for doing on her Facebook group, where, whenever comments go off script, they get deleted.
Thanks to the generosity and experiences of the expats on the Facebook group pages and the TAIP Facebook community, I was able to decipher the Consulate’s requests. My landlord didn’t have immediate access to the property deed, so I sent copies of her electric bill and property tax documentation instead. As far as proof of income, I whipped up contracts with my current clients.
Because I wasn’t confident they would get the stamp of approval, however, until my visa was in my hand, my brain simply would not commit to expending concentrated energy on the move. Even being only five weeks out, I put off my Paris to-do list and allocated most of my time either continuing my Goodbye L.A. tour or being a Dodger fan watching every inning of their playoff games either on TV or watching games at Dodger Stadium until they finally lost in the National League Championship Series, which I secretly hoped would happen, because Dodger baseball alone ate up at least sixty hours. I spent sixty hours training tennis at Silva Tennis Academy as well.
Every day, I’d spend hours checking my email and social media accounts for signs of my ex-girlfriend Sarah, hoping that she’d get in touch with me to see each other before leaving for Paris. It was horribly co-dependent of me, but that’s what it was.
Live music ate up another sixty hours, because with all the deaths, Covid, and purging that had happened this year, live music was my church. In addition to a series of local acts at the Hotel Café, I saw Pearl Jam and the Lumineers a few weeks ago and saw Wilco twice in October. The lyrics from “ Shot in the Arm,” Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm, and What you once were isn’t what you want to be anymore… totally encapsulated why I was moving to Paris. I played that song every day on repeat as I waited for my visa…
The consulate sent me an e-mail merely notifying me that a FedEx package was on its way to me. They didn’t indicate whether my application was approved.
No matter. The most important FedEx package of my life containing the prospects of my future is due to arrive in my lap in less than three hours. I’ve cleared my entire schedule for the day to be home to sign for the package. After a couple hours go by, I receive a text that FedEx tried to deliver the package, but I was not home, and they would attempt a second delivery the following day. Actually, I am home, but they didn’t bother to call. I want to scream.
What occurs next is a series of tragically comedic events in which I talk to three different customer service representatives for over five cumulative hours — all outsourced to call centers in other countries merely reading a script — to directly manage the delivery. I don’t trust their delivery process. The next morning, I drive fifteen miles to the FedEx facility.
Finally, the moment of truth is in my hand. It is anti-climactic, really, this nondescript FedEx envelope that held the promise of the rest of my life. I rip open the envelope. There’s nothing inside except my original passport. I brace myself for rejection and get ready to tell my inner child a narrative that the Universe is telling us it isn’t yet our time for Paris, then get my assistant director part of my brain to get past the disappointment quickly in order to plan for potential scenarios. I open the passport…and there it is, my profession libérale visa. I break into tears of relief and joy. It’s happening. I’m finally going to Paris. I am officially thirty days out.
I call Anne back. “Okay, now I’m excited.” “But just a little,” I added.
After I got my visa, urgency was everything. I booked my flight for November 16, four weeks from that moment. I secured a place for my cat Maddey on the plane. I confirmed my Airbnb reservations. I reviewed the procedures to obtain Maddey’s health certificate. I finally took the new suitcase I bought months ago out of the shipping box and laid it out with my two other suitcases.
Twenty days before my November 16th flight, my grandma was in the kitchen eating a Filipino dish of cow liver and rice when I finally told her I was moving to Paris. “Huh? Where are you going?” she asked in her shrill — Filipina from the poor province — laden accent. Her hearing was severely diminished, and she was too stubborn to wear a hearing aid.
“Paris,” I said.
“Where?”
“Paris.”
“Where?”
“France.”
“Frince?”
“France.”
“Frunce?”
“FRANCE.”
“Oh. France. That’s far.”
“Yes it is.”
“How long you going?”
“I’m not sure. A long time, probably.”
“Three months?”
“Probably longer.”
“Oh, so you don’t stay here anymore?”
“No, grandma.”
She started laughing. “Oh, maybe you stay there for a year!” More laughing. I wasn’t sure why she found all of this funny, but I said, “Yes, grandma, for a year.” And with that, she went back to the TV and started flipping channels. In retrospect, I don’t think she knew how to process the news that I was leaving. She was incapable of processing with nuance. At least outwardly.
After my mom’s stroke this year and enduring the trauma of not being given the chance to reconcile my relationship with her, I moved in with my grandma as a sentimental gesture to connect and say farewell after I was forced to leave the home Sarah and I made together. Grandma is 95 years old, and she just isn’t moving well anymore. We have cousins and aunts who will look after her, but I’m the grandchild of two closest to her. My sister lives two hours south in San Diego but she has her hands full. Besides, my grandma doesn’t trust my sister after the way she handled the responsibility as the executor of the power of attorney over my mom’s affairs. I feel horrible that I’m leaving grandma for Paris, but everyday I’m here, I’m losing more of my sanity, and I simply need to leave if I’m going to stay alive. Not kidding. I gave her a hug, she hugged me back, and as my emotions started to stir and make me feel raw again, I disappeared into the garage with my nose back to the grindstone and turned on a little Wilco to get me through a tedious night of deciding what was going to make it into the five pieces of luggage that would be my Paris life.

I’ve lived in France on and off since 2014. I’m often asked, “How did you do it?” The short answer is a lot of determination and a refusal to take non as an answer. But, I know a lot of our TAIP readers hope to live in France permanently one day (or are already here and want to know how to stay), so I want to share, step-by-step, my own journey to France and how I made it all work.
Let’s get right into it.
I never imagined I’d ever study abroad, never mind live abroad. One day, when I was still in Rhode Island completing my undergrad, a friend of mine had to pick up some paperwork from the study abroad office. We had plans after so I decided to tag along. While I waited for her, an advisor approached me and asked if I was interested in learning more about my options. I shrugged and said, “Why not?” (if you’ve been in France a while, you’ll also find that this is a very frequently used idiom that indicates French willingness to try something new…another topic for another article) and joined him in his office.
I was studying fashion merchandising at the time, so after taking a look at my transcript he told me that my best options would be Milan or Paris. Was I interested in leaving for an entire semester? (no). Okay, how about the J-term in between the fall and spring semesters? (maybe…). He started pulling out pamphlets and I absentmindedly leafed through them.
At the time, I had a steady job at a local boutique and a long-term boyfriend. I thought all of that was way too important to leave, even for just a few months. But, as the advisor continued to sell me on my options (do these people get a commission on sign-ups or something?) I slowly started to warm up to the idea. He asked me again, “Milan or Paris?” Without really thinking about it I said Paris — I’d seen movies, read books, heard about the French capital. I knew what it looked like at least, as compared to knowing nothing about Milan — a few taps on his keyboard as he took a closer look at my transcript and he told me that if I wanted to graduate on time, a full semester was my best bet. “What do you think?”
Again, without really thinking about it I said, “Okay. How do I sign up?”
I didn’t even have a passport at the time and thoughts of my job and boyfriend fluttered through my mind; to be honest, even to this day I don’t know what made me say yes. Unlike some expats, I never had a lifelong dream of living in Paris, and yet, something urged me to do that semester abroad back in 2012.
I ended up having the best six months of my life, completely fell in love with the city, French culture, the food… I’m sure half of my readership knows exactly what I mean. A group of four of us even ended up staying for an extra month down in Cannes because none of us were ready to leave. Alas, I did have to go back to the US to finish my undergrad, and that I did. Dreams of living in France full-time slowly but surely disappeared as I slipped right back into my former life. I graduated, got promoted at the boutique, and moved into a new apartment with my best friend. Life was “good,” though I couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right.
In the winter of 2013 I was still working at the boutique and was, to be frank, miserable. So what do miserable people do when they’re bored at work? They scroll through Facebook, naturally. A message popped up — it was from a girl whom I studied abroad with who had never left after our semester. She decided to stay to be an au pair with a Franco-American family because she wasn’t ready to go back to the US.
We were just chatting, catching up, when my curiosity got the best of me. “How were you able to stay?” I asked. Was it difficult? I can’t stop thinking about Paris myself…
She filled me a bit and then told me that in fact, she planned on leaving her au pair position in May of next year. She loved the family (and had been with them since June 2012. It was November 2013 at this point) and was helping them find her replacement. She ultimately wanted it to go to someone she knew — she really cared about the kids — was I interested? I hesitated. Maybe. I told her I’d think about it.
Life got busy with the upcoming holiday season and I soon forgot about the conversation. Fast-forward to March 2014 and my friend messaged me again. Did I have time to think about coming back to France as an au pair? The family still hadn’t found a replacement. Like most young women my age, I had plenty of babysitting experience and I even nannied for a few summers when I was a student.
Just like that fateful moment in the study abroad office a year and a half earlier, without really thinking about it, I said, “Okay. What’s next?”
While I’m the first to admit that I stayed in my English-speaking-au-pair bubble for longer than I maybe should have, living and working in France was much different than studying abroad. I had to navigate French culture much more often (I was living with a French person and French children, after all), and learning how to adapt was difficult at times.
I was often homesick after the first six months and the initial excitement wore off — I also struggled to find a core group of friends. But, I did adapt, grow, learn, and eventually, thrive. My years as an au pair were some of my favorite that I spent in Paris and when I did find my people I felt like I truly belonged.
The caveat(s)? I still couldn’t speak French, my au pair contract was running out, I knew I didn’t want to work in fashion anymore, and I also knew I wasn’t ready to go back to my life in Rhode Island.
I had to figure out a way to stay.
Well, I did figure it out, but that story will have to wait until Part 2.

Caroline Giddis walks us through French fashion at the height of “La Parisienne.”
By Caroline Giddis, Curatorial Research Associate, High Museum of Art
Paris, the City of Light, was one of the first cities in Europe to install gas streetlamps to illuminate the ever-expanding streets and sidewalks. This new urban development initiative, which began in the 1860s, shed light on new city blocks of ornate Haussmann architecture and allowed city-goers to remain in the streets longer after sunset. What these gas lamps also achieved was extending the lifespan and visibility of a nineteenth-century Parisian woman’s outfit.
While Paris is the pinnacle of luxury fashion and accessories today, this tradition of exceptional craftmanship dates to the reign of Louis XIV, the “Sun King” (1638–1715), and his finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619–1683), who set a precedent for manufacturing and style that would continue through the centuries. Nineteenth-century Parisian fashion was no exception. In the exhibition In the City of Light: Paris, 1850–1920, several works depict women and their attire, whether they are strolling the streets, attending a performance, or serving as the model for a portrait. Using a selection of these works from the exhibition, which range from 1860 to 1913, we can explore the world of nineteenth-century fashion to expand upon the evolutions of the stereotype of La Parisienne, clothing manufacturing and shopping habits, and the center of fashion influence: the stage.
La Parisienne — A Cultural Icon
In the popular early twentieth-century magazine of fashion plates, Le Journal des Dames et des Modes (1911–1914), French poet and playwright Pierre Veber (1869–1942) contributed the guidelines for achieving elegance, writing, “Elegance resides in the perfect harmony of thoughts, words, acts, gestures, attitudes, and costume. It is through costume that elegance expresses itself most quickly.” [1] In Veber’s opinion, the fastest and surest way to project oneself as an elegant person was by dressing the part. The literary figure and “type” that embodied these pillars of elegance in French society was La Parisienne, in which Jean-Désiré Ringel d’Illzach found inspiration enough to create his Petite Parisienne sculpture in 1883.
This figure is dressed in quintessential early 1880s style: a slender silhouetted skirt; a jacket with a form-fitting bodice over a cuirasse corset and high collar, slim, three-quarter-length sleeves; and ruffles, lace, and frills from head to toe. [2] From the side, her large ruffled bustle and train, which she holds in her left hand, are noticeable. No costume was complete without a headpiece, and here La Parisienne is shown with a bonnet trimmed with ribbon and flowers and tied neatly under her chin.
This ideal woman embodied the highest tiers of elegance, wealth, and personal accomplishment of the age. Dressed in haute couture from Parisian couturiers such as Charles Frederick Worth and Paul Poiret, La Parisienne was a walking advertisement for the consumer economy of fashion and accessories. Her fellow Parisians could alternatively visually consume her impeccable fashion at the theater, opera, soiree, or on the newly paved boulevards. La Parisienne was a symbol of both national superiority and ideal femininity. [3] d’Illzach’s Petite Parisienne is composed and elegant — the sculptural rendition of a fashion plate.
Paul César Helleu’s Young Woman Looking in a Mirror (ca. 1895) is another example of the impeccable style of La Parisienne and her careful attention to her appearance. Styling a mid-1890s costume, she wears a high-necked dress or shirtwaist under a layered cape. Capes were highly fashionable during this period because they sat nicely over the ever-growing puff or gigot sleeve. She wears a straw hat trimmed with ribbons and flowers, and her hair is only half-pinned up, leaving a long braid trailing down her back, which was uncommon at this time but emerged as a stronger trend toward the 1900s. [4] Because Helleu’s sketch captures this woman’s private toilette, she may be intending to pin the braid up, but it’s unlikely as she already has on her hat and cape. Helleu depicts her right before the most important moment in fashion, when La Parisienne steps out into the streets of the city.
Street Style at the Turn of the Century
Nothing projects the sophistication, superiority, and luxury of a Parisienne quite like the subject of Jacques-Henri Lartigue’s photograph taken on the affluent Avenue du Bois de Boulogne in 1911. Donned in a wide-brimmed hat, fur coat and stole, ornately trimmed dress, and boots, accompanied by her two pure-bred dogs, she emanates elegance. The streets of Paris, then as today, serve as their runway.
Achieving this look did not come quickly, easily, or cheaply. Couture, and later haute couture, was the ultimate status symbol [5]. Wearing a custom-made garment by Worth, Poiret, or Jacques Doucet demonstrated the unique taste of the woman wearing it and the craftsmanship of the maker, but it also often flaunted the wealth of her husband or lover who could afford to dress her in such a manner. Explaining the power of couture, Valerie Steele writes in Paris Fashion: A Cultural History (2017), “Fashion served both to maintain hierarchy and to weaken it — as anonymous individuals were increasingly judged on the basis of their appearance.” [6]
As the Third Empire emerged in the 1870s, so did confection, or ready-made fashion, which first arrived in small luxury shops and later became the cornerstone of department stores. [7] By manufacturing clothing at affordable prices, fashion found democratization. Dressing in the latest modes no longer belonged solely to the wealthy. The woman featured on Lefèvre’s poster advertisement (1897) sports a common tailor-made ensemble of the late 1890s with a skirt, a blouse over a straight-front corset, and a gigot-sleeved jacket. [8]
The production of fashion affected the consumption of it. Browsing multiple options of ready-made items made shopping a more popular leisure activity, a scene that appealed to artists who captured modern life. In an illustration for the magazine Gil Blas Illustré (1900), Théophile-Alexandre Steinlen shows a Parisienne deciding between two feather-plumed hats at the milliner’s shop while a display of various trimmed caps sits in the background. This scene could also be taking place at a millinery stall in a department store.
Department stores such as Le Bon Marché and La Belle Jardinière revolutionized shopping by introducing a one-stop shop the size of a city block for clothing and accessories. Providing a visual feast of window displays, department stores appealed to passersby and reduced the number of visits a woman had to make while running errands. [9] While window displays, accessibility to fashion, and haute couture strutted through the streets created a web of influence on trends in Paris, one figure held more influence than all others — the actress.
Early Fashion Influencers
Nineteenth-century writer Octave Uzanne (1851–1931) reflected, “An ancient fashion is always a curiosity. A fashion slightly out of date is an absurdity; the reigning fashion alone, in which life stirs, commands us by its grace and charm, and stands beyond discussion.” [10] No fashionable Parisian woman wanted to be caught in a slightly out-of-date outfit, but the hunger for the latest looks reached a fever pitch during the reign of stage actresses such as Madame Réjane (Gabrielle Charlotte Réju, 1856–1920) and Sarah Bernhardt (Henriette-Rosine Bernard, 1844–1923). [11] Because actresses purchased their costumes for certain roles, they wanted the very best to wear both on and off stage, visiting only the most excellent couturiers for their dresses and suits. Madame Réjane, sketched by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec around 1899, favored the couturier Doucet, while Sarah Bernhardt often preferred Worth but refused him exclusivity. Once one of these iconic women wore a Doucet or Worth design during a performance, department stores began copying and producing ready-to-wear versions within days. [12]
This celebrity-imitation method of fashion trendsetting is no different from modern day. When popular stars like Hailey Bieber or Taylor Swift wear a couture designer dress that garners attention, fast-fashion stores manufacture an affordable copy available by the next week, if not sooner. The desire to look just like the most beautiful, talented, and admired figures remains the same.
The Fashion Capital Reigns
For many women of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the figure to emulate remained La Parisienne. The classic, sophisticated, never-over-done vision of elegance, the Parisian woman remains a mythologized icon to aspire to. With 1.3 billion views on TikTok videos tagged with #parisianstyle and #parisianaesthetic, fashionistas achieve the look of a composed, sophisticated urbanite of the French capital. The seventeenth-century origins of French style continue to peek through, however, especially during Paris Fashion Week as fashion houses and designers — the modern couturiers — debut their latest collections in the city’s most historically decadent sites. Many of those same locations served as the first runways for Les Parisiennes promenading in the nineteenth century, underscoring that fashion itself may evolve, while the flow of inspiration between the city and its clothiers remains as powerful as ever.

I survived the Siege of Paris and all I got was this token.,https://alysasalzberg.medium.com/i-survived-the-siege-of-paris-and-all-i-got-was-this-token-9c470ef2383b,"Sign up

Okay, let me start by saying that the title of this post is sort of a joke. I am going to talk about a commemorative souvenir token that people who lived through the 1870–1871 Siege of Paris could buy, but the “all I got” part isn’t at all how most of them would have thought of it.
As France continued to lose the Franco-Prussian War and the month of September, 1870, progressed, Parisians (and visitors to Paris) realized that the Prussian army would soon surround the city. In a short time, Paris would be cut off from the rest of the world and besieged. And so, many residents and visitors left the city as quickly as they could. An understandable decision, of course, and one that many of them were probably grateful for, since those who stayed in Paris experienced hunger, extreme cold, disgusting bread and other food choices, and even a month of heavy bombardment by the Prussians for those who lived on the Left (South) bank of the Seine.
That said, it wasn’t always easy for those who fled the city, either. In addition to sometimes being separated from family members and friends, they also often hadn’t packed what was really necessary. For instance, a letter in Paris’s Musée de la Poste (Postal Museum) that was delivered by pigeon post includes a complaint about not having brought warm enough clothes. This was probably because most Parisians thought the Siege, which started on September 19, 1870, would only last a month or two, if that. And then there was the fact that no one could have predicted that the winter of 1870–1871 would be one of the coldest in recorded history.
Still, the Parisians and foreigners who stayed behind in the city had a great deal of pride that they saw the Siege through, especially when they compared themselves to those Parisians in the upper class or government who had evacuated.
The Siege of Paris had its humorous side. Satirical cartoons were a huge thing during that time, not to mention funny songs. But there was also an overwhelming, often excessive sense of patriotism. Read even a few accounts of the Siege and you’ll easily find a number of examples. One of the most interesting ones I’ve come across recently was recorded by Francisque de Biotière in his memoir Paris dans les caves, épisode du siège 1870–71 (Paris in the Basements, an Episode of the 1870–1871 Siege). He writes about how mothers would teach their babies to blow a kiss when someone said “Pour les Français ! ” (“For the French!”) and to make a fist when someone said Pour les Prussiens ! (“For the Prussians!”).
This was actually one of the more light-hearted manifestations of patriotism during the Siege. You can see the other extreme in things like the arrest of General Ambert, whose “crime” was yelling “Vive la France!” during a battle, instead of “Vive la République!” What was probably just a slip in the midst of a life-threatening situation was perceived by many Parisians as a sign of dissension towards the the newly created Third Republic, which had been proclaimed on September 4.
Even those Parisians who didn’t become fervently patriotic often felt a sense of pride for having endured the Siege. While I don’t understand the hysterical patriotism, I do understand that latter feeling. And after all, we still make and buy souvenirs today that commemorate things like surviving a hurricane and its aftermath or, on a lighter note, getting through a particularly difficult sport-related challenge or hike…or pub crawl.
The 1871 answer to this was a commemorative coin, called a jeton de présence (token of presence). I was surprised and delighted to discover that there are at least two contemporary descriptions of the tokens in newspapers — one in Le Monde Illustré, and another from the Moniteur du Puy de Dôme, a newspaper from a region very far from Paris.
The French Ministère des Armées’ Chemins de Mémoire blog includes a direct quote from the Moniteur du Puy de Dôme (my English translation follows):
On a frappé à Paris une médaille commémorative du siège, uniquement destinée aux personnes qui n’ont pas quitté la capitale au moment du danger. Elle est en bronze, sur l’une des faces se trouve un groupe symbolique représentant Paris repoussant l’étranger, sur l’autre on lit : République française, jeton de présence. Un espace libre permet à chaque citoyen d’y faire inscrire son nom.”
Frappé par la Monnaie de Paris en argent et en cuivre, ce jeton pouvait être acquis par les civils ou militaires qui avaient été présents lors du siège.
(In Paris, a commemorative medal of the Siege has been struck, solely intended for those people who didn’t leave the capital during this dangerous time. The medal is made of bronze, on one of is faces is a symbolic group of figures representing Paris fending off the foreign threat, on the other [face] one can read: French Republic, token of presence. There is a blank space [below this] where each citizen [who’s purchased a token] can have his or her name engraved.
Struck by the Paris [National] Mint in silver and in copper, this token can be acquired by civilians or military personnel who were present during the Siege.)
Le Monde Illustré’s mention of the token is sort of like a companion piece to this. It’s an advertisement, and shows, among other things, that the token was available in other materials as well: white metal (I’m assuming this would be a cheap alloy that looked like silver) and imitation gold, in addition to silver and bronze. There’s no mention here of a copper option, so maybe the two reddish-gold metals were used interchangeably by the writer of the Moniteur du Puy de Dôme article.
Interestingly, the ad for the jeton was published on January 21, 1871 — a week before the Siege ended. Although most Parisians knew the end of the Siege was inevitable at that point, it’s interesting that some were already producing commemorative souvenirs. There is a sense of opportunism, but maybe it was also a sort of consolation — “At least we got through it,” or “France may have lost, but we Parisians were tough and held out as long as we could.”
In all of my research on the Siege of Paris and its aftermath, I don’t think I’ve ever heard about jetons de présence — or if I have, I guess it didn’t stick with me. They are legit, though; even the Musée Carnavalet, Paris’s delightful history museum, has one in its permanent collection.
And then, one day, I came upon some present-day ads for jetons de présence, on Le Bon Coin. A very popular site in France today, Le Bon Coin is sort of like Facebook Marketplace, where you can find anything — including some really interesting antiques. In fact, it’s where I found my beloved Siege of Paris bread souvenir.
From time to time, I’ll head over there and do a search for “Siège de Paris 1870” and see what comes up. In late February, a few jetons de présence were among the results.
Although they aren’t the most iconic Siege souvenir (at least, not for me — that honor definitely goes to bread souvenirs), the significance of them, that sense of pride that they’re so closely associated with, and that universal idea of wanting to commemorate something we’ve been through, really stuck with me. The more I thought about it, the more I wanted to buy one.* One day, a new jeton de présence ad appeared. Unlike most jetons I’ve seen, this one actually had a name engraved on the back, and, rarer still, it was a woman’s name: Blanche La Jousse.
I loved this connection to a real person, and something about the fact that she was a woman made it even more moving to me. I thought of Claire, one of the main characters of my novel Hearts at Dawn.
But whether or not the name had been that of a man or a woman, the fact that someone had purchased this token and then taken on the additional trouble and expense of having it engraved is a powerful sign to me of how much their experience mattered to them and how much they didn’t want it to be forgotten.
…Although a part of me wonders if it was a misguided gift that had been given to them by someone else. Maybe Blanche La Jousse just wanted to move on from the Siege, and didn’t care about having an engraved coin to commemorate the experience. It’s one of those things we’ll never know.
Jetons de présence are often bought and sold by coin collectors, and in fact, when I reached out to the person who was selling this one**, he told me that he dabbled in coin collecting and had bought it at the Marché aux Puces de Saint-Ouen (a huge antiques and flea market just outside Paris) a decade or so ago. He didn’t know much about the Siege of Paris but had been attracted to the coin for the image on the front.
It’s a compelling one: (Likely) on the wall that then surrounded Paris, an allegorical personification of Paris is defending the city with a spear she’s holding out in one hand. In the other, she holds a flag. She’s surrounded by soldiers. There’s impressive detail in their uniforms; we can see the typical uniform of a member of the Garde National, but also the sailor-like uniform some artilleryman/gunners wore. Many of these men were recruited from the navy. We can also see barrels and other materials that reinforced the National Guards’ posts along the city wall. You can spot many of these in photos like this one. Despite all of these details, though, the face of the Paris figure isn’t sharply defined.
Beneath the group, we have the words “SIÈGE DE PARIS” and the year 1870 in Roman numerals.
The back of the token is far less elaborate, with RÉPUBLIQUE FRANÇAISE written around the top rim, in a curved box with a five-pointed star at the outside of each end. The bottom of the token has the same sort of curved box along the rim, but nothing is written in it. At the top center of the token’s back are the words “JETON DE PRÉSENCE”, followed by a small decorative symbol. The rest of the jeton’s back would have been left intentionally blank, and many jetons de présence you find today remain so, but here we see that as was intended, Blanche La Jousse had her name engraved in the blank space.
I like the back of the jeton best, since it has this unique, human touch.
I didn’t expect to learn more about Blanche La Jousse, but when I received the coin, my husband, who’s an experienced genealogy researcher in his spare time, suddenly had an idea. He called me over to his computer. To my astonishment, he’d found a record of her burial in Paris’s Cimetière du Montparnasse. You can see the two full pages of the ledger here. Blanche La Jousse’s name is the seventh on the list. Here’s a closeup of the line with information about Blanche:
The cemetery’s records gave us some insights into Blanche’s life. She died in 1917 at the age of 75, meaning she was 28 at the time of the Siege. I was amazed that this made her only a few years older than Claire in Hearts at Dawn. Not that this is the most important thing, of course. Still, it was a moving coincidence.
According to the records, Blanche lived in Paris’s 7th arrondissement (7th Ward). We don’t know where she was born, or if she ever lived in other places or even other arrondissements, but this means that at the very least, she was living in Paris during the Siege and was back in the city (which was once again undergoing a war and bombing), at the end of her life in 1917. Maybe she was a lifelong Parisian. If she wasn’t, I hope she was happy about returning here.
It’s doubtful that she’s still in the burial plot listed for her, since Parisian cemeteries tend to remove people’s remains to a charnel house after a certain number of years. But there are exceptions — for instance, family mausoleums or people whose descendants continue to pay for the plot. Whatever the case, we plan to go to the cemetery one of these days and see if we can find her gravesite.
I wish I knew more about Blanche La Jousse than this. I hope she likes being mentioned here, and thought about. I know that, like everyone who stayed in Paris during the Siege, she had a difficult four months. I hope she didn’t suffer too much. I hope she liked her jeton de présence and carried it with pride or kept it in a place of pride. The fact that it wasn’t found at the Marché aux Puces till recently makes me wonder if it was kept by her descendants for a few generations. That’s something I’ll never know, either.
But I hope she thinks it’s funny that her jeton left Paris with a collector and now is back in the city, with a family who wonders about her from time to time and admires her for getting through one of the hardest times in Paris’s history.
~~~
*If you’d like to get a jeton de présence of your own, you can find them for sale on various coin collector websites, as well as on eBay. Most jetons de présence, engraved with a name or not, tend to be sold for around 25–35 euros (about 27 to 28 US dollars).
**Special thanks to the man who sold the jeton to me and answered my questions about where he got it. The photos he took of the jeton de présence are the ones I’ve used in this post, since my phone’s camera just could not get that level of definition. I would have asked if he wanted to be credited by name, but once I told him that my husband and I were going to look for Blanche’s grave, he stopped responding to my messages — I think he thought that was creepy.

A Beauty and the Beast retelling set during the 1870–1871 Siege of Paris, Hearts at Dawn has been selected as a Historical Novel Society Editors’ Choice book. It’s currently available in Kindle and paperback formats and is part of the Kindle Unlimited Library. I hope you’ll give it a read!
If you’re a fan of print books, my friend Rip Coleman, founder of Bohannon Hall Press, recently surprised me by reformatting the print edition of Hearts at Dawn. I can’t thank him enough.
I love the improved font, layout, & chapter headings, and hope you will, too!
Whatever the format, if you do pick up Hearts at Dawn, I’d be forever grateful if you left an honest review on Amazon and any other sites or social media platforms where you post. Reviews help books gain more visibility and credibility. Even a review of a short few lines can be incredibly helpful.
I hope you enjoyed this look at Siege of Paris jetons de présence. I’m still taking a hiatus from regular blogging as I work on my second novel. But I’ll be back as soon as I can with more interesting and strange things to share about life during the Siege of Paris. Feel free to subscribe to this blog or follow me on Goodreads or Amazon to find out when I publish new posts.
Until next time!

The view of Paris from Montmartre is one of the most breathtaking sights in the city — a sea of slate rooftops and white buildings, scattered with recognizable landmarks, green spaces and other details like islands among its waves.
But how long has it looked like this?
Last weekend, a friend from the US was standing with me at the top of Montmartre. “What was the view like when Van Gogh was here?” he asked. “Was it mostly fields?”
I told him that it wasn’t — Paris has been a fairly large city for centuries and by the 1880’s, when Vincent Van Gogh was living in Montmartre, it was a huge sprawl of buildings, factories, avenues, the Seine, and several large parks. The view of Paris from Montmartre’s heights would at that time have been roughly the same as it is today.
As someone who loves Paris deeply, and has for most of her life, the appearance of the city during my favorite era of its history seems like a given. But I started to wonder what visual proof might exist to show someone that the view from Montmartre has remained roughly the same — not only from the time Vincent Van Gogh was living there, but also from the time of the 1870–1871 Siege of Paris, sixteen years earlier.
My search for answers has taken me on quite the journey these past few days, revisiting beloved images and discovering or re-examining others. Although I’m left with a few lingering questions, I hope that I’ve been able to put together a good collection of visuals that show what the view from various sides of the Butte (hill) Montmartre was like in the 1880’s and in 1870 and 1871.
The view of central Paris from Montmartre in the 1880’s
Let’s start with the 1880’s, since that was the era my friend asked about.
Vincent Van Gogh lived in Montmartre from 1886 to 1887 or 1888, fifteen years after the end of Hearts at Dawn (otherwise, I would have given my favorite artist a cameo in my book!). From what I’ve read in biographies on him, as well as in his published letters, Vincent — as he preferred to be called — found Paris inspiring, but also overstimulating and overwhelming. And it wasn’t always easy sharing the life of his brother and sister-in-law, whose apartment he was staying in.
Still, Vincent painted a number of canvases during his time here, including a few views of Paris. My favorite of these is Vue des toits de Paris (View of Paris Rooftops), painted in March or April, 1887 (a sketch version also exists).
I love that we know exactly where this canvas was painted: from the window of Vincent’s room at his brother’s apartment, on the 3rd floor of 54 rue Lepic. This building still stands today, and whenever I’m in Montmartre, I stop by to look at it and marvel that Vincent once walked here on his way home.
The apartment is privately owned, so unfortunately you can’t go inside, but apparently some scholars have been allowed to. One of them shared in a blog post that the view from Vincent’s old window has, sadly, changed, with new buildings blocking the glimpse of Paris that he immortalized (you can see the current view from the window here).
Another of Vincent’s paintings from this time is usually given the similar title The Roofs of Paris. This time, we get an unobstructed view of central Paris, looking south from the summit of Montmartre.
Even today, this view from the southern side of Montmartre is the most famous one, since it offers an immense vista of the city below. As you can see in this cropped version of the photo at the beginning of this blog post, which I took from the summit of Montmartre last weekend, barring some additions like the occasional skyscraper, the Paris cityscape has remained more or less the same.
Vincent’s painting is of course an artistic interpretation — like many who’ve painted and sketched this breathtaking sight, he seems to emphasize recognizable monuments like Notre-Dame and the Panthéon, when in reality they probably looked at least a little smaller because they were far away. But I think it shows something about that excitement of being able to spot them and recognize them — like seeing friends in a crowd.
I also think the way he seems to have brought the city closer than it would have actually appeared could be a sign of that connection with others that he always sought. Or maybe it’s just his artist’s eye, knowing the precise way to frame the image and emphasize what’s needed.
Here’s another photo I took from the summit of Montmartre, looking slightly westward, cropped as closely as I can get it to Vincent’s painting:
Here’s the same image, with Notre-Dame and the Panthéon, the two most recognizable landmarks in Vincent’s painting circled:
As we can see, in the 1880’s, Paris was already a large, dense city. But this blog focuses on Paris during the Siege, in 1870–1871, so you might be wondering what was the view from Montmartre was like then.
The view of central Paris from Montmartre in 1870–1871
Between the 1870’s and 1880’s, some parts of the world experienced immense growth. For instance, my friend is from Colorado and I could imagine a frontier town changing a lot in those ten years. But in 1870, Paris looked pretty much the same as it did in the mid- to late 1880’s.
Of the things that had changed about the landscape, most would have been hard to spot from this towering vantage point, where so much is lost in that sea of slate roofs and white facades.
But one sure constant is that Paris was already a built-up city, especially in its central areas, and had been for decades.
For instance, in this 1862 caricature by Daumier of the famous pioneering photographer Gaspard Félix Tournachon, who went by Nadar (and who had recently invented aerial photography), we can see that the Parisian landscape below his balloon is packed with buildings, nearly to the horizon.
This is a caricature, of course, not necessarily a realistic depiction, but Paris had to be recognizable for it to work, so we can imagine that this is a fairly accurate impression of how the city looked from a high vantage point.
And in fact, here’s something that always amazes me: Some of Nadar’s aerial photographs, among the earliest in existence, still survive today. Here’s a view he captured of a part of western Paris. As you can see, certain sites are helpfully labeled…including a portion of the Butte Montmartre itself!
The photo is from 1858, four years before Daumier’s caricature. Yet even then, we can see a city that certainly has its green spaces (including the Parc Monceau, which plays an important role in Hearts at Dawn), but it’s very much already an urban landscape. And this isn’t even the heart of the city.
Another way to understand what Paris looked like in the 1870’s and ‘80’s is to look at maps.
Wikimedia Commons has a really cool collection of public domain maps of Paris throughout its history.
One of these maps, entitled “Le Paris de Napoleon III”, gives us an excellent overview of Paris in 1870.
At a glance, we can see one major difference compared to the Paris of today: the wall around the city. Known as the Thiers Wall (l’enceinte de Thiers), it was demolished in the 1920’s and ‘30’s. That said, as far as I can tell, there was no portion of the wall that would have been visible from Montmartre’s southern slope’s view onto the rest of the city, so it wouldn’t have influenced the famous view from the south side of the Butte.
Another difference that may be a bit more difficult to spot at first, especially if your computer is having trouble zooming in on the map, like mine was, is that the city is a bit less built up in certain areas, especially around most of its perimeter. That would probably give an overall impression of more greenery or space at the edges of the landscape than you’d see today.
Unfortunately, while we have drawings, paintings, and aerial views of Paris at this time, I don’t know of any photographs taken specifically from the summit of Montmartre with the intention of showing the view from its southern slope in the 1880’s or during the Siege of Paris. A big reason for this might be that photographic processes at that time couldn’t show distant landscapes in great detail.
But we’re lucky to have at least a few photos that were taken of people and a certain specific object on Montmartre in 1870 and 1871 that happen to give us at least a notion of the view from its slopes and summit.
This is due to the fact that Montmartre played an important role in the Siege and the Paris Commune (March 18-May 28, 1871), in two particularly notable ways:
1. It was the site of several balloon launches. Balloons are an iconic feature of the Siege of Paris, since they were the only (relatively) reliable means for Parisians to send messages to people outside the city walls — in fact, airmail was invented during and because of the Siege of Paris. Two of the balloon launches from Montmartre are especially notable: that of the Neptune, the first balloon launched during the Siege, and that of the Armand Barbès, which took Léon Gambetta out of Paris so that he could conduct government business and rally French troops on the other side of enemy lines.
Here’s a photograph by Nadar himself, showing the Neptune being prepared for flight, in the Place Saint-Pierre, the square at the base of the Butte’s south side.
2. It was the location of a large canon depot (parc d’artillerie). Many of these canons had been funded by donations from Parisians to fight the Prussians. On March 18, 1871 (about a month and a half after the end of the Siege), the French government’s attempt to seize the cannons to hand them over to the Prussians as part of the terms of the treaty that ended the Franco-Prussian War was the event that ignited the Paris Commune, a period of civil war between the French government and the rebel Communards (most of them armed thanks to that same government, which had encouraged them to volunteer for the Garde Nationale during the Siege).
When I was researching Hearts at Dawn, I came across several photos and images of the canons on Montmartre. But I have to admit, while I know that they were stored on the southern side and possibly summit of the Butte, I haven’t been able to find out exactly where the depot was or its extent. Some sources make it seem as though it was on the summit of Montmartre — for instance, this very detailed sketch shows Saint-Pierre de Montmartre, the church that’s been on the butte’s summit for centuries before the construction of the Sacré-Cœur, just beside the cannon.
But others, like this photograph, suggest it also extended down along the slopes.
While researching this blog post, I also learned that the parc d’artillerie was where the cannons were stored, but they were then rolled to areas called batteries — outcroppings with good vantage points — where they were aimed and readied for firing.
I came upon this sketch by Gustave Doré, entitled Batteries sur les buttes Montmartre and dated March 6, 1871. In the sketch, we can see several spots where cannons were placed along the southern side of the hill.
As a point of reference, here’s roughly the same view today:
Back to the first two of these three historical images — what’s most important, for the purpose of this blog post, is what we can see in the background of each. In the background of photo of the parc d’artillerie, a dense mass of buildings makes up even this relatively small portion of the view towards Paris.
The sketch of the parc d’artillerie also suggests that immensity. Today, the dome of Les Invalides and the (then-new) Palais Garnier opera house are still easy to spot and loom fairly large among the rest of the cityscape. But I can’t vouch for the Arc de Triomphe being so noticeable, as I’ve never seen it from Montmartre’s heights. Like nearby monument The Eiffel Tower (which was constructed in 1889 and thus wouldn’t have been visible in the 1870’s or to Vincent when he was in Montmartre), it’s located in the western part of the city, a view that’s largely blocked by trees and buildings on and around Montmartre today.
You can see the Eiffel Tower, though, if you move a bit past the funiculaire. And according to this blog page, you can make out the Arc from the top of the dome of the Sacré-Cœur.
If you follow the link, you’ll see that the Arc de Triomphe is still pretty hard to spot, which makes me wonder if the artist of our sketch was just trying to emphasize it to give a reference point, or whether it might have been more noticeable because that area, while still pretty built up, as we could see in Nadar’s 1858 aerial photo, didn’t have quite as many tall buildings around it as it does today?
Where could you see the view from Montmartre in the 1870’s and 1880’s?
Speaking of vantage points, it would have been impossible to climb to the top of the Sacré-Cœur in 1870 or 1871, since its construction (started in 1875) wasn’t complete until the early 20th century. But the photographer and the draughtsman of our parc d’artillerie images are looking down on the summit, likely from the Tour Solférino, an observation tower that used to sit on the summit of the Butte. The tower’s two upper floors were demolished so as to be less of a potential target for Prussians during the Siege, and in 1874 it was demolished entirely.
You can see the lower portions of the Tour Solférino, as well get a general idea of what Montmartre’s summit looked like where the Sacré-Cœur now sits, in this painting from 1870. In it, Parisians are looking out over the city from what appears to be a makeshift observation platform. Note that while this artist wasn’t as focused on the details of the cityscape below, his use of grays and whites still suggests its size and density.
You can also get a very good overall impression of what the summit of Montmartre looked like in 1871 from Gustave Doré’s sketch of the batteries: The middle of the summit is a vacant space, with the church of Saint-Pierre on the left, and the Tour Solférino and some other structures on the right. In the center, we can see the tops of distant buildings set a bit further back on the heights of the Butte.
(Possibly) A view of western Paris from Montmartre in 1871
On the other hand, I have to confess that this photo of canons on Montmartre
is less easy to understand. The cityscape in the background doesn’t seem to be central Paris, since there are no noticeable landmarks and it looks more spacious and green. In the right corner is what seems to be a tree-lined avenue. There are no factory smokestacks, probably ruling out eastern Paris, as well as the landscape to the north of the city (a little more on those further on). I believe the batterie in this photograph may have been facing western Paris, but I can’t be absolutely sure.
Even though there are some very precise sources, like this webpage giving detailed information like where canons were kept in Paris and how many were at each site, nothing that I can find specifies how many batteries were on the slopes of Montmartre, or just how far around the hill they went.
(Probably) Views of eastern Paris from Montmartre in 1871
Fortunately, we have more precise information for these next images.
These photos date to the Commune (March 18 -May 28, 1871), and seem to show the same barricade on the Butte Montmartre (barricades were common in many streets of Paris during this time), taken at what appear to be slightly different times and angles.
The first is labeled as being on the rue de la Bonne:
while the second is labeled as being located at the intersection of the rue de la Bonne and the rue du Chevalier-de-la-Barre (then known as the rue des Rosiers, not to be confused with the rue des Rosiers in the Marais).
From what I can guess, the barricade could have been located near the intersection, in the present-day square Marcel-Bleustein-Blanchet, which overlooks northeastern Paris. But it’s also possible that it was at the actual intersection of these streets that we see on a map today; since the Sacré-Cœur wasn’t built yet, it might have been possible to get a relatively uninterrupted view of the city beyond, which would be impossible now. But since the Communards seem to be standing near the edge of the hill, my first guess seems more likely.
In both photos, the view of Paris is unfortunately a bit hard to make out in terms of details, but we can see a cityscape stretching out far to the horizon.
On the other hand, the location of the barricade and the fact that we can make out factory smokestacks and numerous green spaces make me even more convinced that this is a view from the eastern, not southern, slope of the Butte, which means this is a view of northeastern, not central, Paris.
This area was less developed and dense than the center, and many factories as well as parks like the fairly recently created Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, were located here. Even today, while eastern Paris is certainly more built up than it was in 1870–1871, many areas are still a bit more open than the center of the city.
The Butte Montmartre in the 1870’s and 1880’s
Montmartre is an iconic Parisian neighborhood today but for Parisians in 1870, it had only recently been incorporated into the City of Light, when the city officially added all or parts of surrounding villages to its borders in 1860. Before that, Montmartre was a village known for its windmills, taverns and guinguettes (beer gardens). After it became a part of Paris, this reputation was still upheld. It also was a pretty inexpensive place to live. With its cheap rents and unconventional attitude, artists began to flock to Montmartre’s slopes. Over the following decades, these included Vincent Van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, Picasso, Modigliani, and many others.
In the 1870’s and ‘80’s, some parts of Montmartre were somewhat built up. For instance, the building Theo Van Gogh (and, for that short time, Vincent) lived in looks like a perfectly normal 19th-century Parisian apartment building. (That said, Montmartre has never totally followed the rules — as its streets were being paved, many often caved in, due to the Butte itself being full of hollow spaces where plaster of Paris had been mined in previous centuries.) But just around the corner, dirt roads, shacks, and wooden dwellings cobbled together by amateur (albeit talented) builders were the norm.
This area roughly between the rue Lepic and the rue Caulaincourt was known as le maquis. The picaresque slum’s origins date to around the 1870’s or ‘80’s. Despite health and sanitation issues, including no running water or building safety standards, le maquis existed to some degree until as late as the 1940’s. You can see some fascinating photos of the maquis through the years here. Keep in mind that most, if not all, of these photos date to later than the Siege and Commune of Paris.
So, if you were looking at Montmartre itself in the 1870’s, you would see a hill dotted with structures like buildings and windmills, but also plenty of undeveloped areas, including a good portion of its summit. By the time Vincent Van Gogh was there, in the mid- to late 1880’s, the maquis would have been more noticeable, and the Sacré-Cœur would be under construction at the summit.
The view north of Montmartre in the 1870’s and ‘80’s
The northern side of Montmartre looks out over a little bit of the city but mostly beyond it, into the northern suburbs. In the 1870’s and ‘80’s, that view would look more like what my friend was expecting. Villages and towns to the north of the city had fields between them, as opposed to the relentless urban sprawl that you see today.
When researching this blog post, I was excited to come upon this 1874 sketch by Eugène Delâtre, which shows the view from the rue du Mont Cenis, a long road that runs down the Butte’s northern slope. In the distance, we can see factories and villages, but also some green spaces.
This is the most radically different view from the Butte Montmartre. Here’s how it looks today — a vast urban sprawl:
A view out of time
Back to our most famous vista: central Paris, seen from the south side of the Butte Montmartre.
Because some areas of Paris were less developed than they are today, the overall landscape in the 1870’s and 1880’s might look slightly less dense, something that most of the visual sources here seem to confirm.
But overall, as we can see from the images I’ve shared here, as well as what we can tell from sources like maps, guidebooks, contemporary novels, correspondance, and travelers’ accounts, Paris in the 1870’s an d’80’s looked, on a whole, very similar to Paris today, especially in the central parts of the city. The same can’t be said for the view from Montmartre’s northern side; today, the scattered albeit big towns have given way to a vast urban sprawl.
Of course, in the 1870’s and ‘80’s, there weren’t skyscrapers, the Centre Pompidou, or the Eiffel Tower (well, not until 1889) — all of which you can see from Montmartre today.
Another thing to consider is that what I’ve described here are the typical views you’d see on a typical day from the top of Montmartre. But I imagine there must have been times when observers in 1870 and 1871 could see some sign of the forts that surrounded the city firing, or some trace of battles in the northern suburbs. During the semaine sanglante (Bloody Week), in late May 1871, when the Communards were burning down landmarks and government buildings around the city, people could surely see clouds of smoke if they were looking down from the Butte. And I imagine its summit would have been an amazing place to observe the aurora borealis that appeared in the sky on October 24, 1870.
But despite all of this, while it certainly wasn’t exactly the same, the general view from Montmartre in 1870–1871 and in the 1880’s wasn’t dramatically different from what we see today. The city was still dense, especially its center, and you can still spot recognizable monuments like the Palais Garnier, Notre-Dame, and the dome of Les Invalides.
This similarity is one of the things that, to me, makes the spectacular view of Paris from Montmartre even more moving. When I look out at Paris from Montmartre, I am seeing the scope of a city of countless stories. I am seeing nearly the entirety of this enormous place that I love. And I am sharing that view with people from the past. Someone in 1870, a year I wrote about and studied and have grown to love, would see almost the same thing as I do now. For a moment, it’s like we’re standing together, suspended in time.

When I travel my main mission is to visit places in Paris that are not tourist traps. I want to experience a city like a local vs going to places frequented by and designed for tourists — one, because the quality may not be the same and two, you are most likely going to pay more for subpar quality. I, of course, will see any of the major attractions that are on my list to see, but as far as my dining and exploring go, would rather go to gastronomic musts and places off the beaten path, or at least the touristic beaten path. Also, coming from NYC I’m used to a certain level of service, as well as a certain type of charm. Living here for almost three years, I’ve discovered many gems. If you want to discover those gems, this guide is for you.
Image Source: PInterest
If you are visiting Paris, I suggest you stay central, or in the center circle of the arrondissement map above (basically arrondissements 1–9). Most likely you will want to hit some of the tourist attractions, and, if so, you want to be centrally located. I may be biased here, but I think the best place to stay is Saint Germain on the left bank. It’s just more picturesque and not as congested as the right bank, which is definitely more touristy. If you want to feel like a true Parisian and can secure a hotel or airbnb in the 6th or the 7th arrondissement, that is your best bet. If you prefer the hustle and bustle of Paris, I would do the 1st or the 8th for a more upscale feel or the 3rd or 4th for a more artsy vibe.
Pro-Tip: Renting an apartment in Paris is the best way to get the whole vibe of the city and is pretty cost effective compared to NYC. Also, the space will be bigger. Most Parisian hotel rooms are tiny, so if you don’t require all the creature comforts of a hotel, an apartment is truly the way to go!
Super Pro-Tip: For more affordable lodging and a less congested atmosphere, you can also stay along the borders of the hot neighborhoods, i.e. the 15th in the part bordering the 7th, or the 17th in the part bordering the 8th or the 11th in the part bordering the 3rd and the 4th.
So, you are in Paris, one of the culinary capitals of the world. One cardinal rule to remember, you seriously cannot get any bad food here. It is nearly impossible unless you go to somewhere on my avoiding list . And the lovely thing about Paris is you can eat anywhere based on your budget type and get a pretty solid meal. Here are my top three by category.
Traditional Paris Brasserie popular with the media types located in Saint Germain
What to get: Duck Confit, Baba au Rhum, Bottle of Chateauneuf du Pape
The brasserie where Keanu Reeves and Diane Keaton eat in one of my movie faves, “Something’s Gotta Give”
What to get: The hot foie gras, beef bernaise, bottle of the Gevry Chambertin
Where all the old artists like Hemingway, Cézanne and Wilde used to frequent. There are many seating options including an outside or indoor garden, main brasserie and piano bar
What to get: A gin or vodka martini to start, the foie gras, the lamb, crepes suzette flambé, any bottle of red
One of the best tasting menus I’ve had in my life and the priciest, but totally worth it. You can either do a land/sea tasting menu or a veggie tasting menu. Both are equally delectable. Alain Passard is a genius and usually visits each table during the dinner seatings. You can eat downstairs in the cave, which is more intimate (I did find out that this is where they usually seat the tourists, but it’s better IMHO). You can also request to sit upstairs if you want to be seated with the locals.
Amazing Japanese French Fusion Tasting Menu and one of the better tasting menus I have had in Paris. Space is small and minimalist, but food is amazing. There are 3 tiers-discovery standard and luxe. We did the luxe bc I really wanted the truffles but it was honestly too much food, for me at least!
One of the trendier tasting menus here in Paris so make sure to make your resis months out in advance. If you can’t snag a ressie for your stay, Frenchie Bar à vin is across the street from the main restaurant. They don’t take reservations, so make sure to show up a few minutes or half an hour before they open to snag a table. They serve AMAZING wine and tapas style dishes for dinner. If you happen to be just wandering in that neighborhood, Frenchie to go (another part of their family) is great for lunch and sandwiches to go.
Pro-Tip: Have the sommelier choose your wine when you do a tasting menu as they do know best. And, always do the wine pairing if that option is available.
Located down a side street where the 6th meets the 7th, this brasserie is charming and serves up some of the best southwestern French food you will eat in your life. All ingredients are locally sourced and the cheese and wine come from local shops from a few blocks away.
What to get: Foie gras (toast the bread with your private toaster), the duck confit or cassoulet and the cheese plate. Wash it down with some pinot noir or another red of your choosing.
Way down the beaten path in the heart of the 15th, this little restaurant is not one to miss. With a prix fixe menu that changes almost daily, you really are in for a treat. You get to choose a starter, main course and dessert for the small price of 39€ that is a steal since the food is Michelin Grade!
What to get: Menu changes daily, but get the foie gras for your starter if they have it as it is homemade. They also have bottles of the moment, which are usually treasures.
This restaurant is where French people go to dine and treat themselves. Comprised of a slew of great young talented chefs it is hard to go wrong. You can opt for their normal prix fixe set at 39€, or go all out with their 5 course tasting menu for 59€, both a steal for gastronomical dining!
What to get: Menu changes so if you do the normal prix fixe menu where you have a choice just ask for their reccommendations.
If you are hankering for a flavor of the Mediterranean, head over to Balagan. Vibe is trendy and fun and the cuisine is light yet filling.
What to get: Anything with zatar and the snickers dessert. Their international wine selection is a top on my list!
Craving Italian? For a nice cozy feel, head over to Cherche Midi on the street of the same name. Spot is a cute little neighborhood spot where mostly locals go. The food is pretty amazing and you won’t be sorry.
What to get: The lobster ravioli if they have it or any of their pasta/seafood dishes.
Japanese Fusion hot spot in the heart of Saint Germain. They don’t take reservations, so make sure to go either at the beginning of dinner service or towards the end of primetime dinner. If you are here in August, you will have no issue as most of the Parisians are on holiday.
What to get: The cocktails and a few small dishes to share.
So in Paris, you have two options — you drink wine like the french do (and seriously it’s a crime not to) or you drink cocktails. I like doing both. You can find and drink good wine anywhere, seriously, ANYWHERE — a cafe, a brasserie, even McDonalds, so I hear. But if you want to go to a true wine bar or have a real cocktail, read on.
For those of you who are truly french beginners — this is basically a bar for natural wines. Even though I am not a big bio wine fan, I don’t discriminate as they have pretty good wines here, as well as good vintages. They also have a location in NYC
This is a great lively joint in the 9th arrondissement. Love this place because you can either sit in a main bar, but if you prefer a more intimate setting you can book one of the underground caves and enjoy your wine and nibbles in there.
This is more of a brasserie, than a wine bar, BUT they make my list because they have a cellar of 250+ wines. The best is you can even buy a few bottles to take home.
Pro-Tip: If you are not looking for a full out wine experience you are best served going to a brasserie for apero hour, where the french enjoy a few nibbles (charcuterie and cheese plates, or as they call it “planche mixte”) with their apertif of choice.
Love, love , love the Ritz because it has as many bar options a girl can dream of! If you are going for a speakeasy vibe, you must try Hemingway Bar. Regardless of what you are looking for, you must try Hemingway Bar — their bartender is a legend in his field and the cocktails made there cannot be found anywhere else, including the other bars at the Ritz Paris. They also have two outdoor bars, which are lovely on a nice day or evening or a tea room where you can enjoy a proper tea and champagne.
If you are looking for somewhere off the beaten path and a night of surprises, head over to the Marais to this gem. Cocktails are curated in a special artist’s book that would make a nice addition to your coffee table collection. The vibe is fun and lively.
Wanting to hang in the left bank? Then head here for fantastic cocktails, a great vibe and amazing beats. They also make one of best sazeracs I have ever had.
Pro-Tip: If you really cannot live without a true cocktail, make sure NEVER, EVER, under any circumstances order a cocktail at a brasserie unless you want to be majorly disappointed. Always order your cocktail at a hotel bar, a cocktail club or one of the brasseries on this approved list.

Saying that, you can still purchase tickets for the VIP section so you don’t have to wait on the super long line. I personally find the Louvre overwhelming and find a guided tour better able to manage my visit — you can still wander around on your own after the guided tour if you wish. This two hour one is my favorite, and as an extra bonus you get to skip the line!
If you really have no interest in going to the top of the tower, and you just want to see it, head over to the steps of Trocadero, which is the best spot to see her majesty. If you do go in, enjoy a glass of champagne at the top or just book reservations at one of the restaurants to avoid the line completely.
Best time to go here is when it is a sunny day with no bad weather or the balcony/tower areas will be closed off. It’s also better and safer to wander the winding and steep streets of montmarte when it’s not raining or snowing.
You can actually climb to the top of the Arc if you just don’t want to be just another one of those tourists trying to get the perfect shot from the Champs de Elysée. I will warn you that this climb is not for the weak of heart — there are no elevators, the staircases are beyond narrow and the air quality leaves much to be desired.
Pro-Tip: If you happen to be touring Paris with a young one in a stroller, you are in luck. You can get to the front of any museum or tourist attraction line. I have often thought about buying a stroller and putting a baby doll in it just for this perk.
Totally innovative for Paris, this is definitely a must see. Imagine seeing works of art projected in a loft like space with music playing in the background. Book tickets way in advance especially if you are looking for Saturday/Sunday tickets, as this is when the French go with their families.
Pro-Tip: Book Friday evening tickets as they have a bar open during these hours
If you happen to be in Paris during Opera and ballet season, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing tickets to a performance.
Pro-Tip: For a more elegant feel and a true Opera experience, make sure to book at Palais Garnier. If you want more of a casual vibe, head over to Opera Bastille.
Taking a daytrip out of Paris is an easy thing to do whether you decide to go by train, car or uber. If you want to go north, take a train and check out the beaches of Normandy. If you want palaces and to see how the royals lived, head over to Versailles. Want to explore your artistic side? Head over to Giverny and get a little taste of Monet. Looking to get your drink on? The Champagne region is your best bet. The possibilities are endless.
Pro-Tip: If you are going somewhere not too far, totally worth it to check uber pricing. Sometimes it makes more sense than taking the train and is less stressful.
Versailles Pro-Tips: If you do Versailles, highly recommend doing a horseback excursion through the gardens before actually touring the Trianon and the Palace. It truly is an unforgettable experience. If you choose only to do the Palace, I would do the guided tour route like the Louvre, as it is massive!
Being one of the fashion capitols of the world, Paris is definitely somewhere to spend those dollars especially since you get your VAT back, which depending on the purchase, can add up to a lot. You can read more about shopping here.
One of my favorite things about Paris is shopping the Farmer’s Markets. The produce and quality of food here in France is superior to the US mostly anywhere, but there is something special about the farmer’s markets. It is more fresh because they make that morning drive with the produce for one and it feels great to support the local markets and smaller businesses.
Marche de Avenue Saxe (Thurs & Sat)
Bio Market Avenue Raspail (Sunday)
A trip to Paris is not complete without visiting a fromagerie. Even if you are staying at a hotel, you must visit a local fromagerie and do a sampling of cheeses. Love the cheese here vs. US because it is unpasteurized and the variety and the special types they make here are simply second to none.
Quatrehomme
Marie-Anne Cantin
Pro-Tip: You can also ask them to vacuum pack your faves for transport to the US. FYI-this is illegal and I’ve never done it, but if you want to try your luck with customs as many do, by all means, go for it!
To feel like a true Parisian just sit at a café in the afternoon or morning and just take in the beauty around you. If you are here for creative purposes, it is sometimes a nice treat.
Chai de l’Abbaye
La Varenne
Pro-Tip: At cafes, you can sit anywhere that is available. You do not need to be wait to be seated. If you do, it will tell them right away that you are a tourist! And if you don’t know French, no problem! Here’s a little cheatsheet that will help you get around.
Another great thing to do is just chill in the park. The lovely thing about Paris is that you can pretty much set up shop in any of the green spaces. The other great thing is there are no close rivals to the type of picnic assortments you can create here — foie gras, saucisson, fromage, wine, champagne…Create your own adventure and curate your basket to the nines!
Invalides
Saint Germain de Laye (outside of paris but def worth the uber ride)
Pro-Tip: Bring the wine. If you didn’t know, drinking outside is legal here, bien sûr!
Paris is truly one of the most beautiful cities in the world and true Parisians walk aimlessly everywhere. Sometimes it is nice to get just get lost wandering the side streets in Saint Germain and the Marais. My best discoveries in Paris have been made by accident! Best time to walk is in the morning before the sun gets too strong and in the evening after dinner to burn off all the calories you just consumed!
So, there you have it — your Parisian visit at your fingertips. Obviously, I have a long, long list of favorites, but we’d be here for hours if I published that! For the full list, click here and put “Paris list” in the additional info field. Until next time, happy exploring!

Thoughts, tips and tricks from an American living in Paris for a year.
When we first moved to Paris, I did a few posts about all the stuff we went through to move here. I thought it would be interesting or helpful to people thinking about doing something similar.
Before writing about our experiences again, I wanted to give it some time to sink in and really be able to reflect back on what we’ve been through and what I think about it. Well, as we’re sadly just about to leave, it’s probably about time. Here are some final thoughts on being a French family for the last 11 months or so.
I want to start this off by saying that this has been a truly amazing year.
I’m going to go into some negative stuff (as well as some positive stuff) because those things are interesting to me, but overall I’ve loved our stay in Paris. The neighbors and friends we’ve made have been just amazing. The French people we’ve met have been some of the nicest and most welcoming I’ve ever known. The tech community here has been nothing but kind to me and excited that I’m here. My daughter sings little songs in French to herself when she thinks we’re not listening and it’s adorable. My French has gone from absolutely zero to being able to understand and say a fair amount. I know Paris, one of the most amazing and beautiful cities in the world, pretty well now. It’s been one of the greatest years of my life, for so many reasons. I couldn’t possibly recommend trying it more.
Now, on to the fun stuff.
By far the hardest thing about moving to France has been being an immigrant. You are in a new place and you don’t know anybody nor do you know the language, customs or habits of life. Not only is that difficult on you, since new things can be stressful — you’re rarely comfortable outside your house since nothing is familiar — but the real hard thing is that it can feel like almost nobody really wants you here.
From the perspective of the average person you have to interact with, you’re hard to communicate with, you’re probably a little stressed out and you’re frustrated at stuff. If you’re a cab driver or bank teller or waiter, I’m sure you would prefer to have a customer who speaks your language instead of someone you have to gesture to. As an immigrant, you’re highly aware of this and it’s embarrassing. Don’t get me wrong, most of the people we’ve interacted with in Paris have been exceedingly kind and helpful, but as the person constantly putting people a little more out of their way than normal, you’re aware of it.
The people who are not kind nor helpful, however, is the government of the place you just moved to. I assume this is true everywhere — I can’t imagine that the immigration offices of the United States are shining beacons of comfort and inclusion — but it’s certainly true of France.
Within 3 months of landing in the country, you are required to get a residency stamp to validate your long stay visa. This requires you to send in paperwork, get an appointment and go in for a health check. The main issue is that in Paris it takes about 3 months to get your appointment after sending the paperwork in, which means if you don’t do it immediately upon landing there is likely to be some period of immigration awkwardness if you try to leave the country. The rules and procedures are incredibly confusing and only exist on their website in French. If you call them up, they will only speak to you in French. When you get there, all of the instructions and literature are only available in French. Only one of the 8 people I had to interact with on my appointment day could (or would) speak any English to me. Calling the customer service line to try to make sure I was doing things correctly ended in abject failure. (“Vous parlez anglais?” “No” “Umm, OK... [click]”). Remember that this is the immigration office.
The problem for us was that they messed up the appointments and accidentally sent me two appointments for Scott and none for my wife Jessica. So since I couldn’t clarify the issue due to language barriers, we showed up with just the one paper assuming the appointment was for us both. Although her appointment was in fact scheduled for that day, since we didn’t have the appointment paper for her (because they never sent it), she was sent away. This means she had a period of months where she had no valid visa because we had to reschedule the appointment from scratch using only horribly Google-translated emails to their department. This means she couldn’t leave the country during that time because it was likely she would not be allowed to re-enter.
The appointment itself was also humbling and embarrassing. You have to sit in a series of rooms with nobody explaining anything in English and people get visibly frustrated with you when you don’t do what they’re apparently asking you to in rapid French. There is a chest x-ray you have to do where you are shuffled into a private room, asked to undress from the waist up, sit there without your clothes on for a while, then walk half naked into another room with two people in it to take your x-ray, then back again to re-dress. My wife was not super happy about that part.
Now, very interestingly to me, this is not what happens when you are sponsored on a work visa. I’m on a long stay visitor visa since GitHub didn’t at the time have an office in France. Some American friends we met through my kid’s school had none of this experience because his company handled everything for them. No x-ray, no immigration office shenanigans, no OFII humiliation that you don’t speak the local language perfectly yet. Even though technically I’m probably the perfect immigrant — someone who is paid from a US company and just spends all his money here — I felt like a dirty shitty immigrant who was being barely tolerated, probably only allowed to stay here due to a technicality.
My experience in the grand scheme of things was not that bad. Compared to almost every other immigration experience, we probably had it near the easiest. It was really just uncomfortable and embarrassing. It just subtly made me feel that I was not wanted here during a confusing process. However, I happen to personally have the means to leave at any time — I can’t even imagine what it must be like to have to go through all of this when you have few other options. To be immigrating because you have to immigrate. I’ve always had sympathy for immigrants to the US, but from now on I’ll have a bit more empathy as well. It is not easy, even when it’s relatively easy.
Speaking of the importance of learning French if you want to move to France for a bit, it might be of interest how I’ve gotten along in learning another language at the ripe old age of 35.
I have tried just about every possible language learning method there is over the last year, most of them for months at a time. I had a 100 day streak on DuoLingo at one point, doing about 30–60 minutes a day. I listened to nearly 4 full seasons of Coffee Break French, which is probably hundreds of hours of audio content. I took about a month of in-person courses (3 hours a day, 3 days a week) at Alliance Française, a globally renowned French language learning school. I had about 30 hours of (expensive) in-person private tutoring with a local French tutor. I took about 20 hours of private Skype lessons through tutors found on iTalki. Plus, I lived in Paris — going to restaurants, buying groceries, getting haircuts, reading the Metro newspaper, etc.
Here is what I have learned. If you want to learn a new language, there is exactly one method to do so quickly and efficiently — private Skype tutoring.
In my opinion, DuoLingo (or any of it’s automated brethren such as Rosetta Stone, Babbel, LiveMocha, etc) is almost totally useless in a practical sense, at least by itself. It may help you to read a bit, you may get some vocabulary to sink in, but it’s not a natural way to learn language and most of it goes in one eye and out the other (or something like that). Months of it will not help you to actually hear the words when spoken by a native speaker, and you will certainly have no practical ability to produce the language.
The Coffee Break French podcast is excellent for understanding real-life spoken French, but obviously not helpful for producing understandable spoken French. It also unnecessarily gets a bit into the weeds on grammar points. If you want the biggest bang out of it, just listen to the dialogue episodes over and over again.
In-person classes, even at prestigious (and expensive) schools like Alliance Française, are helpful but slow. You rarely actually speak to the teacher in a way where you’re corrected. Most of your dialog is with fellow students who are probably worse at the target language than you are. Plus it’s incredibly expensive in time and money.
The absolute best and fastest way to learn a language in a way where you can land in a country and both understand and speak it effectively is one on one tutoring with a native speaker. The cheapest and most efficient way to do that is with Skype. With Skype (or online video chat in general), you have no commute time, no awkward in-person formalities, you can continue classes even when you travel, you are constantly speaking and are being personally and helpfully corrected, and there is a chat window so the tutor can type out stuff they’re saying or you can type answers (which is really helpful in French where stuff doesn’t always sound the same as it’s written). You can get professional language teachers for as little as $10/hour in some languages. That means that for $200, you can take an hour lesson 5 times a week, every day of a month. That plus an hour of homework a day will get you really, really far in even one month. Probably farther than 3 months of an expensive group class. Certainly farther than a year of DuoLingo or Rosetta Stone.
I found great teachers on iTalki, but there is also Lingoda and LiveLingua which look promising. They all have free trial classes, which is a great way to get over the weirdness you might feel in doing an online private class like this. Benny, the guy who runs the great Fluent in 3 Months blog, who has learned a number of languages to fluency, came to essentially the same conclusion. He reviews the iTalki website here, which is a great read.
I’m testing out my theory over the next few months. While I’m still doing French lessons and want to continue to improve, I’m cutting way back on them and am going to start over from scratch with Japanese. GitHub has started really expanding into Japan and I would love to be able to speak some Japanese the next time I go there.
So, I’ve signed up for classes on LiveLingua and am planning on taking them for 1 hour a day, 5 days a week for the next 3 months to see how far I get, starting at the end of July. My hypothesis is that I’ll be better at spoken Japanese by November than I am in spoken French now, even after a year of fairly regular study and living in France. It will cost me about $1500 total for those 3 months of study, but if I’m right it will be way cheaper and way less of my time than getting to the same language proficiency through any other method.
Look for my follow-up post in November.
Finally, I thought it would be nice to share some of the random things we’ve learned about living in Paris. About every month or so someone lets me know they’re visiting Paris and asks for advice on where to eat or what to do and I write a slightly different email every time. I figured it would be good to summarize the stuff I liked doing and the places I liked eating at the most so the next time you’re visiting you can take advantage if you want.
We’ve eaten at dozens of restaurants in Paris since we’ve moved here. Everything from a 3-star Michelin place (L’Epicure at Le Bristol) to the great family run restaurant down the street. I’ll give you my 3 favorite places in a bit, but first I’ll give you the resource I used to find all 3 of them. Teach a man to fish and whatnot.
The Paris by Mouth blog has been the most amazing resource for dining and drinking in Paris by far. It lists great places by arrondisment and I don’t think there is a single place I’ve been to off that list that wasn’t really great. It also has great lists of wine bars and haute cuisine places. If in doubt, just check this list to find amazing places close to you.
Sometimes it’s hard to find a place off that list — many are closed on Sundays, most of them require reservations at least a day in advance, which means calling them and trying to speak in French occasionally, some of them can’t take large parties, etc. My fallback on these occasions is the Yelp of Paris, La Fourchette. You can search by group size and times they are open and make reservations online. You can also rank by rating and pretty much everything I’ve booked via this site has been really good as well.
There you have it. Now, just for fun, I’ll share some of my personal favorite places to eat in Paris.
The first is Les Papilles. It’s a wine store and small restaurant near the Luxembourg gardens that is my favorite place to take visiting guests. They have no menu, they just bring you a few courses of great French food and you choose a bottle of wine off the wall.
It’s charming and delicious and fun, I adore this place.
The next is Verjus, in the 1st arrondissement, near the Louvre. It’s more upscale and expensive, but not ridiculous. The food is amazing and it has an adorable wine bar downstairs.
The last is a place called Aux Anysetiers du Roy on the Ile St. Louis (a few blocks from the Notre Dame on the smaller island). The clientele is almost exclusively touristy, but we love it. The cassoulet is my favorite and the bathroom upstairs is amazing. I’m not kidding, you have to go to the bathroom when you go here.
I’ll also throw in Dans les Landes, a tapas place in the 5th. I had a frustrating experience with one really rude waitress there once where she didn’t want to seat me because I didn’t speak French, but everyone else there has been great and the food is great (and pretty different).
Of course, food in France is great, but when you visit Paris you really want to have some great wine, right? Well, fortunately there are some great wine bars here, but unfortunately French wine can be really confusing, especially to Americans.
In America, wines are generally labeled by varietal, the name of the grape. So you would generally know that you like a Chardonnay or a Pinot Noir or a Cabernet Sauvignon. In France you will almost never see the name of a grape on a bottle of wine. Instead everything is labeled by “appellation” or region. Each of these regions has rules about what they can grow and how, so if you know you like a Pinot Noir, you have to know that that grape is normally (and almost exclusively) grown in Burgandy, so you have to look for a Burgundy red wine. Of course, it doesn’t generally say “Burgundy” on the label either, so you have to know that “Mercurey” is a region in Burgundy and look for that.
I knew absolutely nothing about wine when I moved to Paris and in my time here I’ve become somewhat obsessed with it. I’ve taken a series of increasingly serious wine classes resulting in just having completed the WSET Level III advanced certification in Wines and Spirits and contemplating enrolling in the Level IV Diploma classes (more on this adventure in another post).
However, you don’t need to do that to appreciate and enjoy French wine. What I would suggest is to take a basic tasting class though. You’ll learn a ton, you’ll drink good wine and you’ll have fun. If you think Bordeaux is a grape, take a wine class here.
I highly recommend the Tour de France wine tasting at the O Chateau wine bar in the 1st. It’s fun, it’s in English, the wines are great, you learn a lot about French wine and they assume you’re an absolute beginner. It’s also a beautiful spot.
I’ve taken a couple of groups of friends and family here and it’s always been super fun.
As you get better at wine, they also have a huge by the glass selection and serve down to 3cl portions so you can taste a bunch of different wines relatively cheaply.
If you’re into tasting different wines, my other recommendation is Wine Touch. It’s a little place by the Pompidou centre in the 4th that gives you a smart card and a glass and you walk around and self-serve from a bunch of machines filled with French wines, grouped by region. At the end you pay for whatever you poured. It’s a fun way to taste several different wines without being intimidated by a server, if that’s not your thing.
Finally, my favorite place to buy wine is a small place on Ile St. Louis run by a slightly crazy Frenchman who deals only in organic and bio wines at L’Etiquette on 10 Rue Jean du Bellay. Everything I’ve bought there has been really good, but that may just be because I really like bio wines.
I shared a number of tips and tricks useful for living in Paris as an American family in a previous post. These were things we learned a few months in, like getting a French bank account or SIM cards for our phones. Well, in the next 8 months we learned a few more things that might be helpful.
The first is getting health care. If you get sick in Paris it can be difficult and intimidating to go to a doctor. They’re not easy to find, they don’t work long hours and they often don’t speak English well (or at least the other people in their office don’t, making appointments quite difficult). Our expat health care had a directory, but we only ever went once. It wasn’t real bad, but it wasn’t a great experience either, plus it would take a while to get an appointment and it was way across town.
What we ended up using for the majority of our health issues while in Paris was the SOS Doctor service. It’s a 24/7 house call doctor service operating throughout Paris. If you feel sick or need something you can call them at 01 47 07 77 77, the service speaks English and all the doctors speak English, they’ll arrive in an hour or so and it’s something like €40–60 per visit.
Now, for French health care, that’s insanely expensive. France operates off of sort of a universal Medicare system, so all doctors visits are regulated at like €22, I think. For French citizens, most of that is automatically covered by the state as well. However, for most Americans, being totally used to the developed world’s worst possible health care system, paying $50 to see a doctor even with insurance isn’t considered ridiculous — I think typical copays are around $30; if you went to the doctor without insurance it would probably be around $200. So for us, paying €50 for a doctor to come to our home in an hour, any time of the day or night and speak English has been a dream. You could go to the French doctor a 30 minute Metro ride away for free (because expat insurance covers 100% of everything because everything is reasonable here), but when you get the winter gastroenteritis from holding on to the Metro pole like everyone eventually does, you’ll be throwing your €50 at these guys.
Finally, God help you if you need a pharmacy at 1am on any day, there is like 1 of them open in all of Paris. On holidays it’s even worse. My advice is to go through this list the day you arrive, find the 24 hour one closest to you and write down the number and address and make a dry run. If you ever need something in the middle of the night (for your kid or some emergency), call them first to make sure they’re actually open. We had a pretty horrible night of me being really sick and Jess making useless Uber rides to closed pharmacies that said they would be open online. I’m not kidding — the night in question was a holiday Sunday and there were literally probably 3 pharmacies open in the entire city of Paris.
Although the food in Paris is amazing, it is in fact very French. If you’re American you will probably eventually want something else. Living in San Francisco for a long time, this was particularly difficult on us. Mexican food here is very rare and generally pretty bad. Sushi is ubiquitous and almost without exception totally horrible. Imagine mediocre sushi you would get from the local grocery store in nearly every single sushi place in Paris.
For Mexican food, you’ll pretty much only be able to find tacos that are any good. There is Candelaria, which is great not only because they have really good carnitas tacos, but there is a sort of speakeasy in the back that is a hip little bar.
There is also El Nopal, up in the 10th, which has great tacos but no seating, so you have to go there on a nice day. We went there on a cold, rainy day not understanding the situation and it was really sad.
If you want to get some American groceries, you have a couple of options. A lot of stuff will be in the local grocery stores, but some things are pretty hard to find. Salsa, pancake mix, maple syrup, cheddar cheese, popcorn, oatmeal — there are a couple of things that you might want that can be difficult to find.
For these things, Jess and I generally go to a ridiculous store called the Grand Epicerie in the 7th. The Epicerie is insane — it’s like a crazy upscale, even more expensive version of Whole Foods. It has a whole fois gras counter, tons of fresh produce and fish, a huge wine cave downstairs, a really good bakery, an enormous cheese selection and a great little cafe to get a glass of champagne in. It also has an aisle of American foods if you’re looking to get any of that hard to find stuff. The Posted in Paris blog has a few other American groceries in town, though I haven’t been to either.
Speaking of missing American things, after some time you might also be looking to watch American movies or television. A few quick tips for you that took us a bit of time to figure out.
If you want to watch a movie, you’re in luck, because basically every movie that everyone on the planet watches is an American movie. We pretty much have a massive stranglehold over the entire cinema industry. Even though there actually is a French cinema ecosystem, of course made most famous by the blockbuster movie “Taken” (just kidding, though that is a French production company), at least half of the movies playing in France (and almost everywhere else in Europe) are Hollywood movies. The trick to going to the movies in France is to look for the letters “VO” for version originale, or VOstF for Version Originale sous-titrée en Français, meaning that it’s in English and subtitled in French. If you look for that when buying tickets, the movie will be in English. The opposite is VF, meaning it’s dubbed into French.
On the other hand, if you want to watch American television shows, even on services that you paid for in the states and may continue to pay for, such as Netflix or even Apple iTunes, you have a slightly larger issue. This is because everyone is fucking stupid. Everything you try to watch legally has regions and borders and ridiculous rules that somehow apply when you’re living in the US but not when you’re visiting France and vice versa. So, in order to keep watching my Netflix shows I use a program called TunnelBear which routes my internet traffic through a US server. If you’re smart, you’ll just pirate everything so you don’t have to put up with all of this bullshit, but I like buying my content, even though the companies I pay for it make it as difficult as possible to use their shit.
Finally, a few tips on having a kid in Paris. There are actually a ton of really fun things for kids to do in Paris, from great parks and zoos to some really amazing museums. Here are some of my daughter’s favorite things.
In the summer, there is a fun little hidden park/playground right by the Grand Epicerie called Compagnie des Filles de la Charité Saint Vincent de Paul. There are a lot of expats and also French families that go hang out there when it’s sunny. Lots of pickup soccer games and champagne picnics in the sun. It’s a great way to meet other families with kids and for your little one to run around with other kids.
There is also a great playground in the Jardin de Luxumbourg. It costs like €2 to get in, but it’s huge and has a ton of awesome stuff to do.
Right outside of it is a little merry-go round where they give the kids these little sticks and each go-round they can try to skewer a metal ring. I’ve never been so jealous of being too big for a ride.
There is also a cool big pond in the middle of the Jardin de Luxumbourg, right in front of the Senate building, where you can rent little sail boats and push them around with sticks. Some good old fashioned 18th century style children's entertainment.
There is also a pretty great and fairly new zoo at the southeast edge of the city. It has a big park right outside of it that is really great and has a great big playground as well.
As far as museums go, there are a few good kids ones, but they’re mostly in French. If you can’t speak French they’re not quite as fun. Jo likes pretty much everything in the Jardin des Plantes, which includes a small zoo, the Grande Galerie de l’Évolution and the rather ridiculous Galeries d’Anatomie comparée et de Paléontologie, which is basically a museum designed 100 years ago and frozen in time.
If you go there, make sure to head on over to the Cafe De La Grande Mosquée and have a tea. You can just sit down in the courtyard and a guy walks around with sweet tea for like €2 each. If you want, you can take a walk around the inside of the Grande Mosquée as well, it’s really beautiful.
Finally, if you want to go to the Louvre and you have a kid, my advice would be to get a copy of “Discover the Louvre” at the gift shop for them. There’s a bunch of cool little games and things for them to look for, it gives them stuff to do as you walk around.
One of the most difficult things to figure out for us was babysitters. There are a few babysitting sites (in French) if you want to go through a bunch of profiles and hire someone randomly, but Jessica and I weren’t super happy with that. In the end we went the more expensive option of using a referral site called Complete Paris. It was a one time €50 fee and they sent us resumes and we picked someone who ended up being really great. I really wish we had done this earlier, because the €50 wasn’t very much compared to the number of times we’ve used her to watch Jo. Since then, Jess and I have actually been able to go out on dates and whatnot.
If you’re still with me after this entire post, then you’re a champ and you deserve something special. I have two snippets of fun insider Parisian information for you.
First of all, I’ll tell you about the best free view in Paris. There are no lines, it’s free, it’s a beautiful view and you can have a glass of wine while you’re there.
It’s the roof deck of the Galeries Lafayette Haussmann, right behind the Opera building. It’s one of the oldest department stores in the world and has an amazing dome inside. Go check out the dome and then go up all the escalators until you get to the very top of the building. There is a big deck with some cafe vendors and a great view. You can see just about everything in Paris from here.
While you’re there, you should probably also pop over to the Opera building, because it’s beautiful and also rarely has a line.
The second special Parisian nugget of information is the secret entrance to the Lourve. It’s not secret so much as just nobody knows about it. On the street in between the Seine river and the south (Denon) wing of the Lourve there is an entrance that is rarely used called the Porte des Lions.
It’s pretty easy to spot because there are two huge green lion statues flanking both sides of the gate. Just walk halfway through the tunnel there and there is a glass door. It always looks like an employee entrance or something, but you can just walk in and buy a ticket. I’ve been through this entrance probably 5 times now and I’ve never seen anyone in line there, even when there are literally hundreds of people in line at the Pyramid entrance.
It’s also pretty easy to beeline it from there to the Mona Lisa and the Venus di Milo, which are both also in the Denon wing.
That’s it for now. I hope this has been helpful if you’re planning on visiting or living in Paris.
We’re actually moving back to the US here in a few days, so this is my last week being a Parisian. Overall, I think this has been a hell of a fun adventure. I didn’t learn as much French as I thought I would, nor did my daughter, but it doesn’t really matter. We had a grand adventure, we got to travel all over Europe, I learned a lot about remote work and I have a vastly different viewpoint on so many things having lived somewhere very different — all of these things helped us grow and made our lives more interesting.
If you’re interested in moving abroad, especially to Paris, let me know. I think it was worth it and I think the world would be a better place if more people were able to do this sort of thing — live in someone else’s world for a short time.

For me Paris is the most beautiful city in the world — the City of Lights, of History, Arts, the city of Culture. No other place offers so much to see and to do as the French capital. Just to start, there are 206 museums, 2,185 historic monuments, many opera houses, theaters everywhere, the best restaurants in the world, charming bars and cafes and luxury shopping like nowhere else. Paris deserves time, and many visits. You can’t do it just once, or in few days.
Which is exactly why so many tourists visit the city — all the time, in great numbers, non-stop. My father, who also loved Paris, once said that Parisians are accused of being rude, but that, in fact, “they are just tired of being visited for centuries”. Indeed.
And right now tourists are coming in greater numbers, despite the terrorist attack of November 2015 and Donald Trump’s declaration that “Paris is out of control, so dangerous’, during his presidential campaign. In 2016 alone, 36,5 million tourists came to Greater Paris, and in the first half of 2017 hotels there received no less than 16 million guests, according to the Paris Visitors Bureau. That is a lot of people! What it means is, if you want to go to any of the major attractions — the Eiffel Tower, the Champs Elysees Avenue, the Louvre Museum or the Marais neighborhood, to name a few — you better be prepared to face crowds of people from every corner of the world: all looks, languages and ages are represented in the streets of Paris. To actually enjoy some of those attractions, you may have to fight your way in.
This is all fresh in my mind. I just came back from Paris after 10 days in the Marais, the charming old part of town that is all the rage now. October is not a particularly high time for tourism — not summer vacation (good luck then!), not a holiday, not the (in)famous Fashion Week, no Christmas or religious holiday, either. Yet, all over the city nervous tour guides holding signs up high, to keep their groups together, disputed with the residents the narrow sidewalks. Crowded? You bet!
And there are newcomers to this scene: the Chinese. Until recently not allowed by their communist government to travel abroad, they are sure making up for it — in 2016 alone, 881.000 Chinese visited the city, and the number keeps growing, again according the Paris Visitors Bureau. Stores are full of them, museums, restaurants, cafes, sidewalks. Never alone, but in groups of 12 or 15 people, they love luxury shopping and buy everything they can, taking many pictures, curious and excited, and clearly enjoying themselves a great deal.
Paris is not only great things, of course. On a sad note, this time I also saw refugees from Syria and other Middle East countries, a problem all of Europe is facing these days, one with no clear solution in sight. Some sleep on the streets, some build shelters wherever they can, a clear challenge to the government of newly inaugurated president Emmanuel Macron. Another concern is the pickpockets in the subway, usually young gypsies who also sing and play instruments in the cars. Once on a ride, I heard a Frenchman near me yell at a kid begging for money: “you should be in school at this hour”. Everyone around seemed to agree.
But even with problems Paris is still amazing — and fun and beautiful, and worth every penny I spend to visit it whenever I can. No other place I know — and I’ve been to many — takes my breath away the way this city does, with its beauty and grace, glamour and class. No matter how many times I see it, it always surprises me.
But this last visit convinced me to be careful with my dates, next time. I will for sure avoid school vacation — July and August — when Parisians travel with their kids but parents from the rest of the world bring theirs. I will stay away from Fashion Week, which in 2018 will happen on Feb 27th — March 6th, when designers from all over come to look for “inspiration”, booking all hotels in the city and causing price surges everywhere.
Come to think of it, I may choose to travel in cold January, when the streets are not crowded and the lines smaller at the museums, something I did once and enjoyed immensely. It’s easy to check the city’s calendar in advance: there is a site in English for that: https://en.parisinfo.com/. I don’t work for them, by the way, but find it very useful and easy to navigate.
No matter what time of year I choose to go, my love affair with Paris will never die, though. In one of my favorite movie scenes ever, the iconic last scene of the movie Casablanca, Rick said to Ilsa: “we’ll always have Paris”.
I thank God for it, and I will keep going back, bien sur.

“…Is to know a great deal.” ~ Henry Miller (controversial author)
Paris is a place of lore. After years of listening to people I love and respect talk endlessly about Paris, we had arrived. Albeit, only for a long weekend. It wasn’t enough time.
It’s not only clients or friends. Paris has been revered throughout history as an artist’s haven.
“An artist has no home in Europe except in Paris.” ~ Friedrich Nietzsche
A divine place of historical significance, beauty and culture.
“A walk about Paris will provide lessons in history, beauty, and in the point of Life.” ~ Thomas Jefferson
And of course, surrealism and the années folles or the golden twenties. The birth of pop culture. The modern development of fashion and style. A melting pot of American influence, tremendous economic growth, film, theatre, and athletics.
Many of my favourite writers and artists have lived in Paris at some point in their career.
“Paris was always worth it and you received return for whatever you brought to it.” ~ Ernest Hemingway
For the novice traveller, Paris comes with quite the résumé.
Dare I say it is the the most over-hyped city I’ve ever travelled to. My feelings are more mixed than history’s. Possibly due to over-saturation and cost of living. Which is saying a lot coming from Vancouver (another high cost of living city). Then again, it could be because I don’t have any Parisian friends to show me around.
It’s the 3rd most visited city in the world, but the average dollar amount spent by tourists is double the top two cities (Bangkok/London). $301/day USD compared to $153–173.
It’s extremely expensive, and shockingly packed with tourist destinations.
You can’t walk more than a few hundred meters without tripping over the next museum or historical landmark. Seriously I can throw a rock from the Louvre to Saint Chapelle.
We saw the outside of pretty much everything on day one. Then we were left wishing we had planned some skip the line excursions. Getting ready to leave and Oktoberfest were so busy we forgot to plan things that weren’t accommodation. Even in October, it was crowded with tourists!
Yes, I understand the irony of that statement, being that I’m a tourist. No matter how I may like to pretend I’m not, or try to experience places as locals do. I remain an ignorant tourist.
I can only wonder how @#%@ing crazy Paris is in the summertime.
Paris, has a population of ~2.3 million. The majority of the city is composed of five story walk-ups. Making it the most densely populated metropolis in a developed country and it’s geographically tiny!
Vancouver is tiny, at only 115 km². We build towers exceeding thirty stories and have a population of only 600k. San Francisco, another tiny city, is 121 km² and 800k people. I’m amazed by the density of Paris without the need for many tall buildings.
Paris is a mere 105 km² with triple or quadruple the people. That means it’s chaotic. Very walkable, with an somewhat outdated and packed metro system. At least it covers a great deal of the city and they post hilarious signs in it.
And my personal Fav…
Are misunderstood. I had full on expectations of being forced to stumble through my poor French. While the person I’m attempting to communicate with snickers behind my back about it.
You hear stories. Few of them true.
The service doesn’t suck, it’s just not Americanized. It’s supposed to be felt and not seen. They are not coming to check on you every 5 minutes. They are not coming by to crack jokes and entertain you for tips. They want you to enjoy your meal or coffee or whatever. When you’re done, ask for the cheque s’il vous plaît and you’re off.
I kind of like it. I’m not fond of being waited on.
People are not rude. But you should keep an eye on your stuff and your wallet when travelling on packed transit. As you should in any major city.
People are fashionable. I should have brought a scarf. A concern Jenny and I both have about travelling to Europe, is only obvious in Paris so far. Not that I’m fashionable to begin with. I have for the better part of twelve years worked in shorts, a sweat-wicking shirt and maybe a track suit of sorts.
There is a pervasive feeling in any country about the largest city. Canadians outside of Toronto like to hate on it. The French outside of Paris also seem to hate on Paris. I get the feeling Parisians are in love with their city.
There is an air of smugness. I feel the same way about Vancouver. The French tend to think that Parisians never shut up about Paris when they leave it. Everything is better in Paris! I don’t feel this way about Toronto but I know some who do.
I’m choked I missed the Catacombs. Things were so crazy before we left and at Oktoberfest we forgot to book any tours.
The only non-negotiable thing for me was the Louvre. I’ve had a fascination with Leonardo Da Vinci since I was a kid and seeing the Mona Lisa was a top priority.
It’s true that no matter where you stand in the room, it feels like she’s staring just at you. A special technique Da Vinci used. Of course the world’s most famous painting is so famous due to the mystery surrounding it.
There are many other famous works in the Louvre like Venus De Milo, Winged Victory, The Coronation of Napoleon, Dying Slave and Liberty Leading Leading the People. Michelangelo. Delacroix. Who cares? I’m all about Da Vinci right now. 😜
We crushed a few kilometers of walking every day. I thoroughly enjoyed taking it all in. You could have a great weekend without going into a single tourist venue.
We stayed near the Eiffel tower. Had a bottle of wine on the grass during one of the hourly light shows. Roamed through a beautiful market. Rolled down Champs-Élysées past the Arc de Triomphe and the Louvre.
I know French food is amazing but we cooked in our tiny AirBnB more often than not. Who can resist French cheese and charcuterie?
After a costly Oktoberfest, we’re attempting to be a little more budget conscious here. It seems more likely we’ll be back to Paris than Munich anyway.
I’m just going to say it. If you like red wine, it’s the best in France. End of story. I’m convinced they don’t ship any of the good stuff to Canada.
Oh and don’t forget about the street art and a surprising coincidence. An Alphonse Mucha exhibit was on when we were there! One of the few pieces of art we own is a print of Zodiac. I’m a much bigger Mucha fan leaving Paris.
That’s our world-wind tour of Paris. It isn’t my favourite city yet but I can see the charm and appeal. We’ll be back for the catacombs.
It was the weekend so neither of us worked which was nice, Bordeaux will be different. Back to work...🤘

Some cities you simply visit, while others visit you. Paris is one of the latter. It doesn’t just stay in your memory; it returns through people, through unexpected messages years later. As if it still cares.
— Grandma, Paris is so beautiful!
I’ve been there several times, and each time it felt as if the city was waking up from a dream just for me. The Seine’s embankment was bathed in bright sunlight, boats gliding across the water, and the streets filled with women showcasing that elusive French chic — something indescribable that makes their outfits unforgettable.
I sang La Marseillaise in a taxi, much to the bewilderment of the driver, and my cheerful mood helped me meet new people.
One day, not knowing French, I walked into a café and decided to greet the waitress with a phrase from Moulin Rouge:
— Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?
She first looked surprised, then narrowed her eyes and smirked, as if evaluating whether I was naive or just bold. Only later did I learn that this meant, “Would you like to sleep with me tonight?” What a way to start a conversation!
By the way, my coffee arrived unusually fast.
I met a girl on the plane. She was kind, talkative, and suggested we meet up in the city. We sat on the terrace of a café near our hotel, drinking beer at a leisurely pace. She told me about her divorce, her family, and I just listened, smoked, and enjoyed the moment.
There are moments when the right place, the right person, and the right drink come together to create pure bliss. That’s Paris.
The next day, we both got food poisoning from oysters at a restaurant. After that, she distanced herself a bit, but we still keep in touch.
Sometimes I wonder — if not for those oysters, would we have met again? Or did Paris give us exactly what we needed and nothing more?
The Louvre was packed with people. Leonardo da Vinci’s works were breathtaking in their original form, but my heart was captivated by Murillo’s paintings. His beggar boy picking lice from his hair — wasn’t just a painting, it was a whole life captured on canvas.
In Versailles, I befriended an IT guy. He was shy, stuttered a bit, but I introduced him to two beauty-industry girls who radiated pure fun. During our tour of Versailles, we drank champagne at the back of the bus. The IT guy loosened up, and later, we all posed among the gardens, mimicking classical statues.
Turns out, life is beautiful when you’re surrounded by warm, tactile, and kind people.
Parisian skies are a work of art on their own. Impressionist painters knew how to capture their shifting tones, and their works fill the former train station — now the Musée d’Orsay.
Though I still find Gauguin’s escapades in Tahiti unsettling, I can’t deny the raw brilliance of his paintings from that period. They hold a special place in my heart. There’s something about them, wouldn’t you agree?
I met two sisters — one of them was a model, tall, slender, playful. We laughed a lot, I invited them to the museum, and later, we took pictures in front of the elephant statue.
I was small, she was like a fairy from a storybook, and her sister stood in between us. Paris creates strange yet unforgettable moments.
We drank beer right in front of the Arc de Triomphe, and then the younger sister let me take hundreds of photos of her in a gray coat with her blonde hair cascading down. When she lay on her back on the Pont Alexandre III, I realized that happiness is just a feeling of the moment.
The Loire Valley is a world of its own. Medieval halls, enormous vases overflowing with flowers, and the stories of marquises who lived extravagantly. That’s where I met a little girl traveling with her grandmother. She dashed through castle corridors, demanding that I take pictures of her in the most unexpected places — on rooftops, beside water lilies, even standing on her head.
On the bus, she insisted on sitting next to me, looked at me with her dreamy eyes, and said:
— Let’s sleep!
She was seven. It was both funny and surreal.
I wonder — if I met her ten years later, would I recognize her?
Paris allows you more freedom than other cities. You can sit in a café late into the night, talking.
— And sit as long as you want, thank God! — says a Notre Dame gargoyle.
At one café, an old man joined our table. He had worked with Tarkovsky, but now he was a hotel porter. His stories about cinema were mesmerizing, though we suspected he had once played for “the other team.”
At some point, he invited us to a nightclub. We went.
The music was strange — acid techno! One French guy from our group drank too much and was supposed to stay at our hotel because he missed his train. At first, we were happy for him, then we were worried — he disappeared.
I hope he just got on another train and now tells his friends about the eccentric group of travelers he met that night.
Paris is always fun, unpredictable, and exciting. It’s best not to plan anything ahead, because new people and places will always find you.
Some cities leave a mark on you.
Ten years later, the little girl from the bus found me.
— I’ve been looking for you, and I found you! How have you been?
I smiled. I guess she wants me to remind her of the phrase she said to me on the bus. No doubt about it.
Paris never says goodbye.
Paris always gives you a sequel.
Every moment spent with Ni unveils new dimensions of grace and mystery. Dive deeper into her world in:

Trying to get at those travel stories about the verve and the swerve. Not your typical source for travel advice. These are stories about how travel changes you and unfolds you, not how best to be pampered and coddled.

Our interest in travel has something to do with our need to find the swerve. The led-by-the-nose tours suit some but not us. We set out to build adversity and surprise into our personal all-inclusive package. We want to be able to remind ourselves that things like sitting between train cars as a result of thinking it was a good idea to save nine Euros on unassigned seats is nothing more than a gift from heaven to enhance our lives.
The hitches and unforeseen hesitations are the swerves that create the pulse of travel.
This was our plan as we set off to grab a slice of Northern Europe. I have never been to this part of the world and neither has my wife. It was a gap in our travels that we needed to fill. And it was the draw of meeting friends in Paris and Switzerland and the Netherlands that set the outlines for our itinerary.
Our overnight flight left me wide awake with excitement while Stefanie was able to snooze a bit. The route to Paris ran first to Frankfort with its awkward funnel through customs that a weary business traveler commiserated with us on, “The worst!” he said. No ranks of Uzi toting police at the airport as I was led to believe. Then on a jump flight to Charles De Gualle arriving in Paris in the early morning.
We got help with our transit connection from a group of young travelers who like us were trying to find the best and cheapest mode to city center. The bus into town seemed promising but more expensive then the Metro so we found our way to the train station and rode into Paris.
The outskirts were unimpressive. But when we popped out of the subway tunnel into city center we emerged onto that glorious limestone and Mansard roofed landscape of Paris I’ve known from pictures and film. Cafes seemingly every three storefronts, busy Parisians hustling off to work, we spilled onto these streets with our luggage in tow and tried to get our bearings.
Promises of easy access to free wi-fi went unfulfilled (as they would continue to be) so we asked the kind shop steward for directions to Petite de Champs, the address of our lodgings. He pointed us off on a tramp of about ten blocks which we accomplished and proceeded to turn down the street that had Petite de Champs in the name. We found the address over a door that was supposed to be green but wasn’t. Door locked. Asked at the cafe if we could borrow his phone to call the lady and she described her place in variance to what we were seeing. We should have known something was up.
She said the key was upstairs under the mat. Since we couldn’t get in the street door the cafe guy somehow produced a key and let us in. We lugged our travel belongings up four flights and upon winded arrival found no key under the mat as promised. We collapsed in the hall and a dog bark inside one of the flats brought a young lady to the door. Yes, address and apartment number were correct, no she didn’t know our host’s name. This is truly weird. We were clearly missing a piece to this puzzle.
Back we go down to the cafe to discover through a second call and the cafe man’s astute observation that there were TWO Rue Petite de Champs. This one was Rue Croix Petite de Champs (“the road that crosses” our Petite de Champs). So off we march to find the correct Rue and the aforementioned green door and all the details familiar to our host’s descriptions. Our first swerve.
To get to our real Paris abode we climbed another four flights of well worn stair treads to the sound of our screaming calf muscles and behold, find the key under the mat! Our room was tidy and totally sufficient to our needs. We managed to contact our friends who had been if France now touring alredy for a week and made a plan to meet that afternoon. After a long travel day with swerves large and small we settled in for a snooze.
That didn’t last long because we were in Paris and the city was waiting just out there! Off we went to find our friend’s lodgings which were in the same area of Paris, the First Arrondissement north of the Seine. We mapped out the walk to get there but to no avail, missing a turn and requiring further instructions from yet another in our chain of kind shop owners who served us so faithfully. Turning down Rue de Hyacinth we were greeted by our friend’s “Bonjoir” from his second floor balcony. We reunited with our good friends Wolf and Charlotte from San Miguel de Allende and Charlotte’s son Ethan. Sat in their salon (this is Paris after all) to catch up and make our plans for the next few days.
We launched off for an afternoon walk through the gorgeous and immense Louvre courtyards where a cellist was busking under an arch that led towards the pyramid.
Great acoustics there that did his talents proud. We lingered a while to listen and became acquainted with the magic that is The City of Lights. Then down to the Seine to see Notre Dame in one direction and Musee d’Orsay in the other. Our original lodging was to be on a barge in the Seine in front of the Musee but our host there had to cancel due to some hitch with periodic maintenance. Sadly, it was not to be for us but we had moved on. Walking back through the Louvre courtyard back into our neighborhood we found our dinner restaurant. I had duck confit which was fittingly outstanding. The waiter helped me learn to say “I don’t speak French” so I could beg off as needed. I was using “no parlez vous” which accused the person opposite me of not speaking the language. I was also working hard on my “Ravi de vous rencontrer” (“nice to meet you”) which served as my only accomplishment of a multi-word French phrase during our stay in France.
The next day Stefanie and I went back to the Louvre, this time actually going inside. We entered through the pyramid and sat down to map out our visit since this most enormous of art museums requires a strategy to trim the seemingly infinite possibilities. We headed first to the French and Italian painting of the 16th and 17th centuries. We were both stopped dead in our tracks in front of the Holbein portraits. Soft and pulsating flesh that has actual blood flowing through it as best I can tell. Firm and telling hands. Eyes that beg conversation. These people emerge from the years as fully alive and unburdened by any mists of obscurity history presents.
We found an amazing veiled bust of a woman in the Egyptian wing that stood our neck hairs on end. She had all the mystery of the ages wrapped in her half hidden face and could easily have been mistaken for the work of a modern master.
Rooms and rooms of paintings. On through early Renaissance Italian works where Stefanie called me back to pause because I had rushed by a bit. She was right as usual. These were delicate and everyday human renditions that broke from the religious/aristocratic subject matter.
Then rooms and rooms of furniture for the era of the the King Louis’. Seemingly endless collections of amazing craftsmanship but largely vacant of people who, including me, find the style overbearing and fusty. All that effort by expert furniture makers who I’m sure thought their efforts were proffered in a style that represented the pinnacle of everlasting beauty.
Finally, and more by chance than design we crossed by the famous “Winged Victory” to the more populated wing where the icon of all things art resides. “The Cult of the Mona” was in full throng and the packed room focused their cameras on the tiny, charming, sedate portrait that causes people with only a nodding familiarity with art to change their life’s course in order to view. The painting looks just like the reproductions and is just about poster sized as well. Nice but I wasn’t exactly moved to tears by the encounter.
“The Cult of the Mona” throng who were taking pictures, on the other hand, were more interesting to me. The cultural anthropologist in me was interested in expanding on the theory of large groups as they relate to cultural icons. I also wondered how time will operate on this painting. Will we ever actually get over it? Is there life outside the cult? In my picture of the swooning multitudes I counted three who where actually looking with their own eyes at that particular moment.
The next room is where I found my true joy. Against a side wall in a room full of absolute masterpieces was the monumental “Raft of the Medusa” by Theodore Gericault. Depicting the crisis moment after an apparent shipwreck in tossed seas (based on an actual shipwreck with tragic loss of life), the painting presents the survivors huddling and comforting each other while the more intact denizens of this piece of flotsam raise a red cloth to signal a far distant ship. An image of human struggle to maintain hope in the face of nature’s imposition of mortality.
We headed to our rendezvous (Paris thing again…) with our friends in front of Notre Dame Cathedral. We were late but they were later. Our plan was to walk into Sain Germaine across the Seine and time was getting way from us. That and the long line into Notre Dame led us away to cross the river leaving the famous Cathedral for our next visit to Paris.
The West Bank of the Seine is where we came upon the well known green boothed book sellers called “bouguinistes”. We strolled the Seine’s bank and examined the wonderful contents of each booth. Some had the uninteresting plastic tourists mementos but most had great old posters, postcards and photographs tracing the history of Paris. Several vendors were selling truly beautiful etchings and lithographs, many with cityscape and landscape subjects from the past centuries.
We turned back to review the stands once more because our target was the famous Shakespeare Booksellers shop. This landmark of Paris was owned by the person who first published James Joyce’s “Ulysses” and did it while others were still scratching their heads over it. Tight little aisles and racks of books new and old. And full of my favorite variety of human beings; those who read actual books!
Upstairs were small nooks and rooms like comfortable pockets with chairs stuffed right for a relaxed afternoon read. Quiet people with heads pointed towards some tome of literate fantasy or other account of the human project.
Outside we sat on a bench for a little refreshment and it turns out our choice was a famous place of repose. A group of tourists wanted to sit and have their pictures taken there. I obliged, by getting up and saying “What, did Hemingway sit here?” which seemed to amuse them. I’ll have to dig into the bench’s provenance.
We then walked into the neighborhood of Paris that took the prize from us both: Sain Germaine. Here is the true pulse of Paris; in the voices from the cafes and in the silence from old churches, in the beat of the people strolling at ease in the slanting rays of the sun, in the rhythm of five and six story grey limestone edifices capped with the Mansard roofs rising up to shout “Paris!”. I did not want this episode of our travel to end. The pulse had become my own.

Paris is commonly used in music lyrics. Why is such a popular subject? What does Paris mean in these lyrics? How do people perceive Paris?
The Chainsmokers define it as
“1: A sentimental yearning for a reality that isn’t genuine.
2: An irrecoverable condition for fantasy that evokes nostalgia or day dreams.”
Paris gives a sense of fantasy that people don’t have in their mundane life.
“We were staying in ParisTo get away from your parents”
— The Chainsmokers
It’s a place to runaway. It’s a place where you don’t have worry about all the problems.
“But how I’d love to go to Paris again” — The 1975
It’s a romantic and satisfying place that people want to go but never got to go.”
“You and me in ParisFree to be who we arePrisoners of desire”
— Karen Souza
It’s a place of freedom.
“We don’t need a fancy townOr bottles that we can’t pronounce’Cause anywhere babeIs like Paris in the rainWhen I’m with you”
— Lauv
Anywhere can be Paris if you are with the right person. This indicates that Paris is a romantic place filled with love. I have to agree that Paris in the rain is memorable. There aren’t many people with umbrelllas.
“I got Paris Blue hung over my shoulder” — Frequent Flyer
It’s a place that can bring sad and happiness at the sametime.
“April in ParisThis is the feelingNo one can ever reprise”
— Ella Fizgerald
Lyrics just say so much but it seems like it’s necessary to go now. It’s a place that cannot be reprised.
“We’re so Paris when we kissed, when we kissed” — One Direction
It’s more than a place now. It’s a description of how romantic people can be.
“Why oh why do I love Paris Because my love is here
She’s there, she’s everywhereBut she’s really here”
— Frank Sinatra
It’s back to the definitions of all of the above. It’s a fantasy place. This is my favorite song among all songs about Paris.
What’s so great about Paris? I had the same question until I saw the Tour Eiffel blinking at me at 11PM. (It felt like it was winking at me.) Walking around the streets at night with the wind blowing through your hair makes you forget about everything. Seeing Giuseppe Acrimboldo’s Four Seasons at the Lourve, you find out how paitings can communicate to you. Drinking a cup of espresso on the sidewalk makes you love coffee more than ever. Looking at all those famous people buried in Cimetière du Père-Lachaise makes you realize how at the end we are all at the same destination. As people said in thousands descriptions, “You need to see it to know what I mean.”
It’s a place that seems unreal and ideal.
Paris is the best representation of fantasies.
I’d like to live in the Paris for awhile.

It’s been a few days since I landed in Paris. I tried to write the first night, but I got about a paragraph and a half completed and had to stop because I was tired. Here’s what I wrote:
“It’s 7:28 pm in Paris and it’s been an interesting first day. The flight landed at around 1 pm and I partially slept on the flight. Enough that I didn’t feel that bad and that’s a pretty good way to start.”
Just a few minutes later, we went out on our first exploration of the area to walk along the canal St. Martin and happened to come across a restaurant we ate at last summer, Le Verre Volé. It was excellent and then we popped into a neighborhood wine shop and tried two glasses of wine that were excellent and with varietals I’ve never heard of before. It was a wonderful first day.
Our second day in Paris started out by sleeping in. I didn’t sleep well that first night and was up at 3 am not able to sleep. Then, we slept in and didn’t get out until 3 pm. The next day consisted of running some errands: eating at a now favorite boulangerie, Du Pain et des idées, (Considered one of the best in town), getting a new French phone number, going to the Alliance Française to check out the process of the placement test, then walking through the most beautiful garden on the planet, Le Jardin du Luxumbourg, and then deciding to head over to the Louvre, because it’s open until 10 pm on Wednesdays and we wanted to see if we could purchase our yearly pass, Les Amis Du Louvre. We were able to purchase our passes and decided to see just one thing…. Marcelo gave me the choice and because he mentioned Napolean III’s chambers, which I had never seen, we went there. I think the Louve is best experienced in small doses because it’s so so big and there’s so much to see. I was actually considering blogging about going to every room in the Louvre over the next year, since it’s something that I really want to see and experience.
After walking through Napolean’s palace chambers, we found a high rated wine bar with charcuterie in the Marais which was on the way back to our airbnb that looked good. We meandered there walking through areas we’d never seen and just as we came upon the Pompidou, we turned left and had an incredible platter of rillette, two types of fromage (cheese), and jamon iberico and another type of ham. SO good.
We literally walked outside after it was over, to see a bustlingly busy bar, or street, rather, since half the patrons were outside smoking, and thought, “Oh, this looks like a cool bar!” and started walking in only to find my one friend in Paris, there with a group of his other friends. This is a feeling I haven’t had in a long time. Walking around a place and randomly running into someone I knew. Capitol Hill in Seattle used to be like this for me.
Today, Day 3, we woke up and I had a coffee down the street at a Portuguese cafe with real Pastel de Nata (which were excellent), then we met our official translator of our Marriage Certificate to pick up our French translation to later include in my equivalent of a green card application. Then we get more pastries from aforementioned new favorite pastry shop and I went to the Alliance Francaise to register and take my placement test. We spent the evening at home, eating incredible organic cheese from the “Biologique” market a block away and drinking a ridiculously good cider for 3€.
Now that I’ve had some more time to think and process, I’ve come up with some things that have surprised me, awed me with their beauty, stunned me with their simplicity, and with their cost.
Easier than Expected
There were some potential hurdles that I was worried about that turned out not to be hurdles: checkin for the flight in Seattle, immigration and customs in France, and getting a phone. I was worried that a one-way ticket would sound off the alarms and that we would be detained by immigration. We even printed out the EU regulations in English and in French just in case a customs officer didn’t want to let me in the country. But, alas, they were not needed. I checked into my flight and went through immigration and customs very quickly.
Getting a phone number was also much easier than I anticipated. My husband is an Italian citizen, so he just showed his passport, and they started signing us up for our new phones. Oh, and it was also a lot less expensive than we expected. We got a phone number for 9€ each and then a monthly payment of 30€ which has unlimited calling in France and free roaming in Europe. We got prepaid phones for the first few months so that after we get our apartment, we can switch over to a package that includes internet.
I have been reading a book on Culture Shock in France and read that one shouldn’t smile too much and that Americans smile and French people find it unsettling. The woman who helped us with our phones was very kind and chatty and smiled a lot.
Misconceptions about the French
Everyone (aside from one, which I’ll talk about later), has been incredibly kind and helpful. We’ve had good service, helpful, smiling people in shops, and very patient people willing to help us out. Honestly, I’ve had an extremely positive experience here in France every time I’ve been here and running into one person having a bad day doesn’t mean that every French person is rude.
Ok, the one rude person was the checker at the nearby supermarket. I waited in line for my turn and when it was my turn, I put the shopping back on the counter so he could check my items. Apparently, I was supposed to take them out of the basket, because in a huff, he dumped the basket over, toppling out all the items and then glared at me. I didn’t laugh, but I thought about how it must be a stressful time of day since the line was long and he was the only person there. Eh. Whatever. I know now to take them out when I see him. I tested out this theory getting some groceries tonight and the woman at the other market was super nice and just stared checking the items out of the basket before I could take them out. Ok, it was just that guy.
The French don’t speak English. Wrong. We literally have to continue speaking in French to people once they realize we aren’t native speakers or we are a little slow. Marcelo is MUCH better than I am at French (speaking both Portuguese and Italian, the roots of the words are very similar) and he told me this would happen. Just keep speaking in French, even if they respond in English. I’ve been tripped up a few times, but most of the time, I can follow what’s going on, even if I can’t say exactly what I want to say. So yeah, everyone has been incredibly helpful and speaks English pretty well.
Some fun cultural differences
You bag your own groceries and you always pay extra if you need a bag. Everyone carries around reusable bags to use for groceries. I still need to get one of those (I know I have one at home, but sadly, didn’t bring any with me).
Get used to waiting longer than you think. Another fun cultural difference was having at the wine and charcuterie last night. When we got to the wine bar, the one guy who was working said we could sit wherever we wanted and that he’d be right there to check on us. He gave us menus, and off we went. There were two tables available (and we had a reservation, so it was nice that we had a choice). One was cramped in between other tables and the other had more room around it, but it had dirty plates from the previous guests. We sat at the nicer table with more room, but with the dirty dishes. Surely, he’ll be by soon to pick them up…
…
After about 10–15 min, we are questioning what was going on. We look over and realize he is the only person there and that he is preparing all the food for everyone. Ok, makes sense. It’s a small place, but he’s busy. We discuss whether it’s culturally appropriate to give him the dirty plates. We could smell some of the paté from the previous plate and well, we kinda wanted to not smell it. Marcelo thought that would be considered rude (I think generally American Type A-ness is considered rude in France), so we opted to move them to the other, sill vacant table. Marcelo took them over and then came back a mix of shocked and horrified and said that everyone in the restaurant turned to look at what he was doing. Apparently, you’re not supposed to bus a dirty table, or move them to another table.
Around 25 min after we arrived, we still hadn’t ordered. The waiter came by to say, “Just a minute,” and “We ran out of bread so I have to go get some next door.” And then ran out of the restaurant, had a smoke break while he was chatting up the cute girl up front, then came back several minutes later to cut the bread and brought it out to the other tables.
Then, he took our order. We didn’t know how the menu worked, so we had to ask a few questions and he then had to bring another menu and we waited again for him to come back… after we ordered, he put together the plate and well, the photo says it all. It was shockingly good. The rillette alone was amazing, the wine was perfect, we both had a different favorite cheese and there was a moment half way through the meal that I realized that the Jamon Iberico was most likely literally from Spain. It was excellent. And my Spanish friends out there will be proud to know that the Jamon truly represented Spain well. Love.
Nothing goes to waste. Oh yeah, I forgot the other thing about the bread. After the other table left, he picked up their bread basket and put it on our table, next to the fresh basket of bread that he brought us. Marcelo pointed out, “You’d never see that happen in the US!” True that. Nope, but I didn’t mind. I’m glad it wasn’t thrown out. It would have totally been a huge waste because the bread was so good. I think Marcelo said it best when he said, “This meal couldn’t be eaten without bread.”
Eggs are kept outside the fridge. Really? Yeah, really. We looked this up last week because I didn’t believe Marcelo when he said Europeans don’t refrigerate their eggs. We found this short video that explains why. But yes, it’s true:
Wine is crazy inexpensive… and excellent. It was hard to find bottles over 8€ in the store. Tonight, we had a crazy inexpensive cider for 3€. We splurged to get a Morgon, (A particularly amazing Beaujolais) for about a quarter of what it would be in Seattle.
I have so much more to write about and so much more to say, but I’ll leave it here for now. For those following my instagram, you’ve seen more, and I promise some of that will make it into this blog too. Some of it won’t. Like how we happened to come across a game store, only to find it’s solely a Warhammer store. They kindly invited us to do a quick demo of the game and miniture painting and also directed us to another nearby board game store that sells the games we’re used to. I didn’t take a photo, but I was impressed. Games were similarly priced, or less expensive, than in the US. I seriously thought everything would be expensive, but no, life is not only much better here, it’s also less expensive.

It’s been a good long while since I popped on here to share anything about books and/or life, but when life gets busy I tend to get quiet. As any of your in corporate life know, the first quarter comes in like a lion with everyone ready to do All The Things as quickly as possible.
But stepping back in time to last fall, I wanted to share two special trips that Sergio and I took in 2023. Coming into 2020 we had talked about our desires to take our parents on bigger trips — rather than looking back with regret when they were at an age when traveling was more challenging, we wanted to prioritize these trips.
One global pandemic and more than three years later, we finally made good on these plans at the end of 2023 — a trip to Paris and Rome with Sergio’s parents and sister, and a separate trip to to Prague, Dresden, and Berlin with my parents and my brother.
Anyone who knows me at all knows I’m itchy and somewhat twitchy if I don’t have a trip planned, but a multi-generational trip was something a bit different for me. Today I’ll share some highlights and what I learned from our first trip with the Ricos to Paris and Rome, but if you don’t make it any further than this, remember that planning — along with realistic expectations — are your best friend.
Alors…
I have nothing but love for Paris — and I’m talking about pre-influencer Paris, but the Paris of 2023 is far different than my first trip to the City of Light in 2008. Back then we carefully held onto our museum passes as they were stamped one by one, made sure we had enough euros for everything, and bought packs of tiny paper tickets to use the Metro.
NO MORE MY FRIENDS, NO MORE. If you expect to show up and walk into anything, you shall spend your vacation in lines. It’s not that Paris hasn’t always been this beautiful or popular, but that international travel is more accessible to more people than ever! This is amazing, but is particularly tricky if you’re going to tour Paris with people who aren’t ready to run to and fro, this is where your planning has to start.
After spending some time re-familiarizing myself through the prolific works of St. Rick Steves, we implemented one of my favorite travel strategies when traveling in a group, What’s Your One Thing? It’s exactly what it sounds like — what is the one thing in this particular city that you must do, that thing you’d regret skipping? Prioritization is critical on any big city trip, but when you’re considering different physical abilities or budgets, this is the best way to include the most-desired spot for each traveler (no-vetos!).
[Mine tends to be some sort of museum or cultural site because I AM ME and I could spend an entire vacation doing three museums a day and then reading alone in a hotel room at night but again, that’s just me!]
The great news? Paris has so many lovely sites and many of them don’t suffer from a repeat visit. We also tend to have similar travel preferences — none of us were there for the nightlife or the boutique shopping or Michelin restaurants. That made it rather simple to make sure that Sergio made it to Versailles and I got (another) visit to the Rodin Museum, which really and truly is my favorite in Paris while my sister-in-law got her show at Moulin Rouge.
With your initial list of sites, I recommend putting together a shared Google Map with all of the possibilities. This is important for any trip, but we found it especially necessary for traveling with our parents (all in their 70s) to minimize the amount of walking or number of Metro transfers. This allows you to make a call on what sorts of transport make sense for a particular city.
If it is accessible to you — and let’s be honest, a lot of it isn’t — the Metro is the best way to get around Paris (get a Navigo pass with a photo — it took us 45 minutes to figure it out but I was proud that we did it!). However, it’s full of steps with many stations lacking elevators or escalators. We lucked out in that we were able to make it work — barely. The traffic in Paris can be really horrific but we did use Uber when needed instead of walking (my personal preference) to make sure that we were pacing ourselves as a group.
Thank you, Internet, for making it easy to add restaurants to our shared map as well. If you spend more time than expected in a museum, it’s tempting to stop into the nearest cafe to eat. However, a little bit of research gave us multiple options to make sure we could find different types of cuisine to try (and was helpful for me given my dietary restrictions). We also split up at times to try different spots, especially when we had differing levels of hunger (Sergio and I tend to eat 3 American Square Meals and the rest of the family follows the Latin country cadence of breakfast, late large lunch, and small or no dinner).
Another set of activities that is great for senior travelers would be bus, boat, or (in Rome) golf cart tours! These maximize the sites you can see while seated, and, if done early in your time in a city, provide a good overview. I did a lot of research to pick a good boat tour in Paris and a golf cart tour in Rome because some of these companies really cater to the unprepared, which could mean more time in lines and possibly a sub-par experience.
Random isn’t a good plan for big European cities these days — you’ll need a reservation for major sites like the Louvre or the Eiffel Tower (which we missed — oops!) or you’ll stand in a long, long, long, long line, or just be completely out-of-luck. The Paris Museum Pass helps get you into many sites, but separate entry reservations are often required. In Paris, big sites also mean security lines and possibly restrictions on bags that you can bring with you. This is where a Rick Steves guide comes in handy — you can learn which entrance is fastest at the Louvre or how to see St Chapelle before the security line is too long.
What we ended up with was a great blend of structure and flexibility. We planned one key event each day (eg; a museum, a tour, a day-trip) and a meal together. This was usually in the morning, as getting to an attraction first thing can mean a shorter security line (sometimes). Because our hotel had a great breakfast buffet, it was easy to get up, grab something to eat, and get out off the door by 8:30 or 9:00. This generally resulted in a lunch around 1pm, which created a natural breaking point. Folks could rest or nap at the hotel, or we could go to other interesting sites or shop in the neighborhood. This left time to find souvenirs, try desserts, or find another Engligh language bookstore (hi, it’s me) or even just walk through a church or a park. It also means you’ll stop by secondary sites and get to know them well — whether it’s the very under-rated church of St. Sulpice, the Paris Zoo, the Conciergie, or Napoleon’s Tomb (aka three miles of walking that looks like three blocks — whoops!).
Paris is much easier if you can speak some French — and as the only sort-of French speaker on the trip, I was the one who stepped in if no-one spoke English. I find the French to be generally kind and helpful if you are polite (not a loud American) and are respectful. This means saying bonjour when you enter, asking before you handle produce at a market, etc. These are actually very simple things to do — any good guidebook can help you! — that show respect and create goodwill for an interaction. Most people in France can speak some English (or are completely fluent) and are generally willing to switch to English if you graciously ask, Parlez-vous Anglais, s’il vous plait? That being said, I knew enough that when we did encounter people who didn’t speak English that we were able to get by in French (think of immigrants who are newly-learning French to make their way in the country). I think with joy about a lovely woman who cooked us the best meal in France in a tiny kitchen in a market who spoke French and Arabic — so my sad French got us through it! It’s one of my favorite memories of the trip because you don’t need that many words to share a connection with someone else. Don’t always believe the hype — start by asking yourself how you can adapt to get the best experience and go from there.
But before too long, it was time to travel to Rome. After researching options the most cost effective — balanced with the amount of time — was to fly. All I will say is this — coach seats on ITA are punishingly small and you always need an extra hour in CDG, no matter how fast you think it will be.
So, let’s keep this honest. Italy is my least favorite country in Europe.
It’s closely followed by Spain (super surprising given that I visited it with a Spanish speaker, but it was the wrong type of Spanish, the Latin-American variety…), but I wanted to give Rome another good try. I know so many folks who love it and it’s full of incredibly history and museums, which is perfect for me. Our previous visit was in December, which was a little bit less engaging — and we also struck out the food. I also had travel companions that were incredibly excited for Rome, so I wanted them to enjoy it too.
Those fantastic planning skills I mentioned above? These were even more critical for Rome because holy crap was the city overrun with tourists in the second week of October and why is everyone doing a TikTok dance in front of the Colosseum? Given all of this, it’s much more important to prioritize your sightseeing and get creative with your entrance times and to make sure that you have enough shade, water, and rest for everyone, not just the elderly. There’s nothing like sweating through your entire outfit, right?
For some reason, some of the sites like the Colosseum or the Vatican Museums make it nearly impossible to get in without either buying a combo-ticket (which might include a site that you don’t want or an included meal you don’t want to eat) or joining a “follow-the-flag” tour. This was completely different than our visit six years ago, and it’s the absolutely worst. Most tickets are sold to resellars who maximize profit with these upsells, and even if you tried you’re not able to get these other tickets.
As a planner and an independent thinker I found this incredibly irritating and it felt to me like we had less flexibility! We had to check in more than 30 minutes early for a tour-guide who did a really poor job with the Colosseum, and without a combo ticket for a lunch we didn’t eat, we wouldn’t have been able to see the Vatican Museums or the Sistine Chapel (so you’re welcome, Pope Francis, for the extra donation to your country). Even with my months-ahead planning, we couldn’t get tickets for the Roman Forum — but in fairness, I was probably the most disappointed about that.
My favorite site this visit was the Capitoline Museum that overlooks the Forum and the Colosseum. Sergio and I hadn’t visited it on our first trip so this was my choice for my One Thing. We did it on the hottest day as some (but not all) of the rooms were air conditioned. With incredible art, architecture, sculpture, and views, it was almost tourist-free and quite enjoyable. The tablet guides were essential as none of us spoke Italian — and it was pure luck if you encountered someone who was fluent-ish in English. We also benefitted from an incredible cab driver who drove us around the back way so our older travel companions didn’t have to climb one thousand stairs to the top of the hill. I did appreciate the care and respect for elders that I noticed throughout the trip.
Central Rome is a rather compact, flat and walkable — minus temperates in the 80s and 90s and no real breeze to speak of. Another challenge to keep in mind if you are traveling with older people is that there is almost nowhere to sit down in public in Rome, and if you sit on the steps someone will come and angrily ask you to stand up. I’ve never been to museums where the only place you can really sit down is on a toilet when you need to use the restroom. Perhaps this is a reason so many people sit down in the church pews to rest aching legs and pray for a break!
The Metro is very limited so we used cabs to get around most days. Though they are in theory quite reasonable, we were overcharged more than once — even official cabs “forget” to run the meter. Because we usually had to take two cabs as we were five people, it was extremely obvious that a six to ten euro price difference in cabs that departed from and arrived at the same place one minute apart from each other were not on the up-and-up. Travel means getting ripped off sometimes, and thankfully this was the extent of it (or perhaps a slight mark-up on a dinner). We were very careful with our money and passports, especially in crowded areas, and we stayed in safe areas of the city. This is important for everyone, no matter your age, to be aware of your surroundings and know how to ask for help if you need it.
That’s not to say we didn’t have great cab experiences either — like this man who took all of us at once, or the gentle man who drove us from our hotel to the Vatican Museums, chit-chatting nonstop in Italian, but then, at a stoplight, holding out his hand to me and saying in perfect American English, “Hi, I’m Bob” and then right back to the Italian for the rest of the ride. Bob was good people.
These delightful local encounters are the ones I’ll remember the most, whether the accommodating and helpful staff at Hotel Lancelot, the wonderful woman who led our market tasting tour, or the staff at one of the cat sanctuaries who knew cat people when they saw them and let us get our feline fix, if only for thirty minutes. We were lucky to travel with two extroverts, and my beautiful and kind sister-in-law was made for the Italian joviality and spirit! Sometimes you envy those characteristics that are so natural for some people, but not for you.
Here’s the other part of a family trip that you can’t overlook — making space for alone time or couples time. As the most introverted person on the trip, I knew I’d do better if I built in some time for rest and relaxation. I chose not to go on a day-trip that Sergio planned for Orvieto — which was a wild success! — and instead visited a nearby church, had a long lunch, and napped and rested in our hotel. A part of planning is also understanding what each person needs from an energy standpoint. Do people need a midday rest or an extra hour to wind-down at night? Or do you do best with a morning coffee along before everyone else tromps into the breakfast room? Take that into account too — speak up for what you need to manage your energy and refrain from judging the energy or rest needs of your fellow travelers. We are all at our best when we can tap into the ways that we relax and recharge, whatever they are.
I do love trying local cuisine, so I made a point of getting deeper into restaurant research and we did find some real gems, from a wine bar across the street from stores that sold habits and candlesticks to a tiny neighborhood trattoria with the best truffle pasta I’ve ever had in my life. We splurged for one of Rome’s nicest old-school restaurant, complete with an incredibly kind waiter who teased and joked but provided best-in-class service and a whole plate of butter on request.
It was joyful to see these places through the eyes of Sergio and his family and to see them again in a different light for myself. I’m not naturally meant for Italy, I don’t think, but with a more positive frame of mind there were lovely things that I missed the first time around. And when you try different experiences and talk to locals, you can see a place through their experiences too.
The massive drawback to Rome was the hoards of tourists more interested in a dance or a pose in front of a fountain than learning about the two thousand years of history, culture, and all that happened in this place. It’s ROME! I wanted to yell at these folks who occupied whole sidewalks such that one had to step into traffic in the street to walk around them. This stupid sort of tourism that’s taking over places like Dubrovnik, Amsterdam, Venice, or Barcelona, not to mention the crush in smaller towns like Hallstatt, Bruges, or Porto. Of course everyone can want a photo to say, “Hey, I went to [insert cool place]!” You’ve been looking at our photos of amazing places that we visited throughout this entire blog.
But is that the attraction — just going there? Isn’t it more interesting to see the Chains of St. Peter or The School of Athens or Trajan’s Column? I’ll get down off of my cranky old person soapbox in a moment, but c’mon folks! You can sample great gelato and check out some art; you can get a cute photo at the Forum and see the temples. We are lucky enough to live at a time when we know more than ever about those who came before us and we’re lucky enough to have technology to help these sites come alive. There is a world behind a screen — so if you just want to hang out with your phone, give everyone else a break and perhaps stay home.
Where did I land with Italy? This second trip was certainly more enjoyable than the first because of my travel companions… and I think I’m good for now. We’ve visited about half of Europe’s countries, so I’m ready to see some of those first before another loop back to Italy.
But… all-in-all, this was a fantastic trip with all sorts of experiences where we lucked out with hotels and made do with the unseasonably warm weather. The planning truly made it easier to adapt to different travel preferences and needs, and I’d say the trip was a smashing success.
And now the plot twist. Because travel doesn’t always go as expected, does it?
We had all packed and were ready for our flights back home to the United States and Mexico, respectively. We had to be out of the hotel by 5:30am to catch our flight to London to transfer for our flight home and the rest of the Ricos had an 11:30pm flight back to Mexico. I woke up in a cold sweat at one in the morning and proceeded to be violently ill for hours and hours. I am so, so, so sorry to all of the poor people on our floor who had to listen to all of… that, but I was that special kind of sick where my only thought was don’t die don’t die don’t die. Sergio went down to the front desk in the wee morning hours and managed to keep our room for an extra day and change our flights with British Airways to the following day. I don’t remember much of it, but my body was shaking so hard with chills that my intercostal muscles ached for days afterwards.
This is probably a story for another blog, but I’m unfortunately much more of an expert on getting food poisoning despite how careful I tend to be with what I eat and drink. That is an unfortunate part of having an inflammatory bowel disease, but I’ve learned a lot through these experiences, and in the future I’ll find a non-gross, non-graphic way to share my recovery protocol.
I was very lucky to be traveling with a doctor (my father-in-law) and a nurse (my mother-in-law) and they have the world’s most tricked-out travel medicine kit that they opened to us. They were differently unlucky with their own flight delays (a late-night flight pushed eight or nine hours later into the morning)! Thankfully our second attempts at departure worked — we flew home without incident (and, in my case, with basically no food) and though it was a wee-hours-of-the-morning connection in Mexico City, the rest of the Ricos made it home too.
What would I leave you with from this trip? Do it. Take the trip and don’t wait. Make the best of what you have now because none of us are guaranteed good health into the future. In our case, all of the planning ahead of time made the trip much easier and removed a lot of mental load while we were there and gave us time to really connect and experience these places together. Whether it’s Rome or Paris, resting on a beach, climbing a mountain, or taking a cruise, you and your family are worth that time together. I hope you take it with those you love.
Au revoir, S
P.S. See you soon with a Jan/February book review and then (hopefully) another blog about our travels to Prague, Dresden, and Berlin with my family— our first European Christmas!

I kicked off the New Year alone in Paris with nothing to do.
It was my first ever New Year’s Eve spent out of the country, not to mention alone, and I had only a few short days to make a game plan. Right off the bat, I decided that, given the choice between an all-out nightclub with strobe lights and disco balls vs. staying home by myself with a bottle of red wine, I’d opt for the latter. But ideally I wanted to find some middle ground between the two — maybe a quaint bistro party with sparkling conversation en français, or possibly a sophisticated and slightly fancy family fête, complete with warm pork roasts, multiple rooms to roam, and a guest list of 40 people.
As soon as I started asking around, I quickly learned that local bistros either morph into club scenes or are shut down completely on New Year’s Eve. It would be hard, as a temporary city resident, to stumble upon the ideal setting and scenario on my own. I also discovered that most Parisians stay in for the ceremonious ball drop, surrounded by close friends and family, either gathering locally in the city or stead departing for their country homes. That left me with one option — somehow get invited to a Parisian house party.
There were two fairly significant problems with this plan:
Then of course there was the question of trust. You can’t just ask anybody off the street to join them for New Year’s Eve — there has to be some vetting factor to give yourself a little bit of security and peace of mind. So, over the next three days, I decided I needed to spend as much time as possible in local restaurants, cafés, and other local hangs in search of new friends to ring in the New Year.
As you know, I like traveling alone and do this with some regularity. It’s particularly fun for me to look for opportunities in social settings around me to interject myself and learn something new, and I have a few general rules that I follow when looking for the perfect hang:
With all this in mind, I set out to maximize the number of opportunities spent in these types of places over the next three days. Not going to lie — this is not always the most comfortable social experience. Here’s why. Even after I find a location — say, a café — that meets these criteria, the next thing to do is position myself in a location that invites conversation. If I’m at a bar or bistro bar, I will sit only one seat away from the next closest person at the bar, or sometimes even squeeze myself in as the open seat in between two smaller parties. This surprising social move, while slightly awkward for a moment, has been a pretty effective technique for me to at least trigger a small-talk conversation.
If there is nobody sitting in that area yet, the next best thing I can do is position myself in a highly trafficked location, make eye contact with everybody that walks by, and smile. In that one gesture I look for people who also happen to be showing up with a similar mission as myself: Making new fast friends. Sometimes, someone may walk in who’s meeting a friend running late, sometimes that smile may encourage somebody to sit down next to you, or sometimes I’ll get roped into a small group conversation nearby. Yes, I’ll be honest: This likely involves unbreaking eye contact with strangers for a few seconds longer than normal. The good news is that you can practice it and that there’s really no downside, as the chances of seeing anybody again are relatively remote.
If all else fails, I just use the resources around me and make small talk with the wait staff in French. In my case, this would inevitably throw off triggers and red flags to everyone around me that I’m not a native French speaker. Sometimes this would work to my advantage and another patron else would jump in and ask where I’m from. (People typically assume from my accent that I’m from the UK. On my proudest day ever in France, I was asked if I was from Belgium.)
But even if none of this happens and nobody strikes up a conversation with me, even if nobody sits close enough to me in order to start chatting, I have one strict rule for myself: Stay off my phone. Pulling out a smartphone at a restaurant or café is the kiss of death to meeting new people. It sends an instant sign to everyone around you that you’re more absorbed with whatever it is you’re doing, reading, or responding to than the environment around you. I’ve found that no matter how distractedly I fiddle with my phone, it’s still a real blocker toward meeting new friends in the real world. I try to keep it off the table and in my purse.
Instead, I carry a book. Oddly, reading a real, print book in public does not seem to have the same effect on people with regard to them keeping their distance. People seem to feel less threatened by it, and I get interrupted while reading all…the….time. The other benefit of having a book with you is that, even if you don’t achieve the holy grail of sparkling new conversation with strangers, at the very least you can fall back on a (hopefully) good read.
So, with this in mind and book in hand, I set out to make friends and conquer Paris. Some places where I made friends included:
But as of midday on December 31, while I had managed to meet about a dozen new people with these tactics, my New Year’s options consisted of the following:
Needless to say, this was not exactly what I was looking for.
When traveling alone, it’s always important to have a backup plan in any situation. In this case, my Plan B for New Year’s Eve was as follows: Wander around the neighborhood and try to find a happening (yet sophisticated) bistro party. (Note: This plan also also included stockpiling a bottle of champagne and some food at home, just in case I was unable to find anything interesting to do and needed to toast the New Year’s alone.)
I decided to take on a stretch of bistros in the 6th arrondissement along Boulevard Raspail, within walking distance of where I was staying. My loose game plan was this: Wander slowly past bistros, peer inside to scope out the scene and the people, and see if there is a venue or group that looks inviting enough for me to join. A few blocks away, I noticed a corner with 2–3 restaurants back-to-back. I decided to check it out. One of them was just a sit-down dinner spot, with families in mid-meal. The second was a bit more lightly populated without any buzz or energy whatsoever. The third, while also mostly comprised of families dining out, had one thing the other two didn’t — a large gathering area by the bar, which happened to be decked out with champagne flutes. Bingo.
Bypassing the crowds who were waiting for tables, I walked in, ordered myself a champagne, and waited. It was 9:30 p.m. Presently, there were two older couples at the bar and another family milling about. I guessed that more people would fill into this area as we approached midnight. I drank my champagne very….slowly…. But nothing happened. I passed the time by vigilantly watching the jazz combo that was floating through the restaurant and performing for different tables.
Unfortunately, by 10:15 p.m. not much had changed. Multiple other folks and families had wandered in and out of the bar, but merely as a holding area prior to their seated dinner. None of them seemed interested in talking to me. I was the only person there alone. Not great.
From the bartenders, I found out that there would be dancing downstairs leading up to midnight. “You’re in the right place,” he assured me. We’ll see about that, I thought. I looked outside. There were now easily 75 people waiting in a line to enter the building. So I decided to give it one more drink before trying my luck elsewhere. This time, I asked for a recommendation and was recommended a “mix-your-own” champagne cocktail with infused gin, raspberry syrup, and fresh berries.
About five minutes later, another couple approached the bar, decidedly younger than most of the other patrons I had met up that evening. They spoke in French with each other quietly as they poked through the cocktail menu, but then I heard the unmistakable query directed my way: “Excuse me, but what is it that you’re drinking?” I turned to see the woman pointing at my mix-your-own-drink creation and explained to her in French which beverage I had tried. She thanked me and turned back to her friend. She ordered the same drink. And, had I detected a faint accent in her French?
Going on a limb, I decided to try my luck, and I asked her in English: “Are you traveling in Paris as well for the New Year’s?” She looked at my silently for a full 10 seconds, and I panicked thinking how rude it was for me to assume her nationality. But then she replied. “Actually, yes. I’m working here teaching English to French children but I’m from Chicago. I’m Alina*. This is my friend, Georges*, a true Parisian, born and raised.”
This tiny intro was enough to catalyze a full-on conversation between the three of us, mostly in English, a little in French. I learned they were here because one of their good friends was the guitar player in the traveling jazz combo who had been performing around the restaurant.
“Oh bummer, you just missed them,” I remarked. “They were playing all over the restaurant but stopped about 20 minutes ago.”
“Actually, they are playing downstairs now,” Alina said. “We came to see them, and were supposed to be able to get in to see our friend but they told us that it’s for paying dinner guests only. We’re just waiting for them to come by the bar and let us down there.”
“Ah, so the dance party downstairs has already begun?” I asked. “Good to know. I’d love to check it out before I leave so let me know what you learn.”
We spent the next 10–15 minutes chit-chatting about my trip and their lives in Paris. He works in IT; she’s a new teacher who just moved to Paris a few months ago. They were both around my age. Georges grew up with Martin, the guitar player downstairs, and their friendship has continued to grow strong over the past decade or two. To show support for their friend, Alina and Georges left the house party to come and see their him perform. They really wanted to see the show.
At one point, Alina decides we should all make a break for it. Realizing that the entrance to the fete requires only acquiring a gold wristband at the door, we carried our cocktails and headed downstairs. Moments later, we found ourselves squarely secured inside of the jazz combo dance party, a spacious room lined on the perimeter with cocktail tables where families and couples sprinkled about. The room was bathed in a fuschia light, with the combo playing upfront. It’s decidedly classy. The lead singer fed the room’s vibe by offering us an American jazz classic; her nonchalance and easy vocalizations bounced off all of the walls.
The bar downstairs was lined with champagne flutes ready to be poured, and I headed over to investigate. But as soon as I did so, a man in a suit approached my new friends, sternly telling them in French something that appeared to make them both instantly dejected. At that, they started to head toward the door.
“Hey guys, wait — what’s up?” I called at them.
“We have to leave,” said Alina. “Apparently this party is for dinner guests only.”
“But don’t they know that you have a friend in the band?” I asked.
“Yes, we told them, but they are being super strict about it.”
“Hang on, that’s not fair. I didn’t have dinner here either.”
“Well you should stay for sure!” piped in Georges. “In fact, we need you to stay. Please go tell Martin how sorry we are that we weren’t able to see him.”
“What? So that’s it? You’re leaving?” I’m annoyed on their behalf. These folks came all the way from the 11th arrondissement to see their friend play on New Year’s Eve.
“Tell him we’ll be upstairs waiting. We’ll see you up there afterward I guess too,” said Alina, eying the door. “We have to go.”
And then they left, leaving me alone again. Glass of champagne in hand, I turned to face the music. But it wasn’t the same.
One of the best parts about traveling alone is that it’s pretty easy to slip through the cracks. If you walk into a packed restaurant with a line out the door, you can often cut it all on the spot by agreeing to sit in that one awkward seat at the bar. If you run into a café right as they are about to close, as just one person, they might make a late dish just for you. If you’re shopping at a boutique and trying to haggle for a certain promotional offer on your purchases, it’s more likely the shopkeeper will let an exception slide by for one person, as opposed to a small group. And if you’re hanging around a bar at a fancy bistro on New Year’s Eve for long enough, the bistro owners will decide it’s not a problem for you to bypass the “dinner guests only” rule and hang around until the clock strikes twelve.
But this time, it didn’t seem right for me to enjoy this party and the jazz combo while the friends who traveled across the whole city to see him couldn’t enjoy it too.
I considered my options:
Of the three of these, which do you think I chose?
A few more minutes passed as I assessed the scene around me. Waitstaff and bartenders were frantically darting in and out of the bar, preparing for the shift of the masses from upstairs to downstairs. But I needed a manager or head waiter of some sort. Finally, I saw a man in a custom-fit blazer race by me, monitoring the setting downstairs on his way.
“Excusez-moi de vous déranger, Monsieur, mais j’ai une petite question,” I announced. Translation: Sorry to bug you but I have a small question.
“Oui?” he turned his full attention to me. I began, to the best of my ability, a French persuasive argument.
“Well sir, as it turns out, I have two friends upstairs who at the bar who I would like to be able to join me downstairs. They are actually here because their friend is performing in the band, and they would really like to see him, but they were told that they can’t come downstairs as they did not eat dinner here. I understand this rule, but is there any way that they could come back downstairs with me to see him perform?”
He assessed me a bit more closely. I tried not to cringe at any grammar mistakes I had made in that plea. I thought about adding in one last caveat: “And since nobody here is dancing yet, I’m sure they would be up for it and liven up the room,” but decided against it, not knowing their tendencies in that area. At last, he nodded, took my champagne glass, and stowed it on the bar to be safe upon my return.
“Come with me,” he said. “Point out your friends to me.”
He hustled up the stairs, with me two quick steps behind. At the top, I stood next to him and pointed out the couple, and he rushed over to them, acknowledged what we had discussed, and began to lead them back in my direction. He had the hostess take care of their coats, and walked all three of us back downstairs together, calling out what he had done to the doorman on the way in.
And with that, we were reunited downstairs. Alina and Georges were elated, albeit a little confused. To be fair, so was I. But we didn’t overthink it. And within a matter of minutes, Alina (who apparently had taken years of swing dance classes back in the U.S.) was stepping her way around the dance floor. Georges, meanwhile, whose style seems more akin to that of Danny Kaye, literally stole the show on the last number with an improv piece of pantomime and hilarity as he cheered on his friend in the front of the room. It may have been one of the funniest things I have ever seen — it takes a truly brave soul to have no fear and to just dance with abandon like that. At the end of the set, the band got a hearty round of applause, and my new friends had their fair share of patrons run up to them and compliment their impressive dancing skills.
After the conclusion of the performance, I met the rest of the band, including Martin, the guitar player, and we spent the next 20–30 minutes chatting and dancing. But at 11:30 p.m., Alina and Georges realized that it was getting late, and they needed to head back to their other party. The three of them turned to me as they prepared to bundle up and leave: “Would you like to join us? We’re heading up to the 18th arrondissement with friends.”
I paused to consider my options. That was all the way across town, so if I were to attend, I would no longer be within walking distance of my return at the end of the evening. I looked back around the room again. While certainly a classy and fun party, being at this bistro alone was the epitome of finding loneliness in a crowd. Aside from Alina and Georges, nobody else had given me the time of day to chat. I decided I’d rather ring in midnight in the company of my new friends than around a group of anonymous strangers. It would be worth the trip. So the four of us hopped on the Metro.
As we approached the Concorde stop on the M8 line, my phone revealed that we’d crossed the threshold. “It’s midnight everyone!” I shouted to no one in particular. Our Metro car cheered. Outside we heard the roar of a collective crowd shouting and screaming somewhere above ground at Place de la Concorde. The doors closed and silenced the ceremony. Our driver gave the horn a few long “toots.” Alina started to sing “Auld Lang Syne.” By 12:01 we were already at the Madeleine Metro stop, and the moment had passed. It would be close to 12:30 a.m. before we would walk into the house party with more of their friends to be greeted by a warm group of Parisians in an apartment that smelled like a mix of champagne and cigarettes. And I wouldn’t have had it any other way.
*Not their real names.

In Woody Allen’s classic movie “Annie Hall,” he’s waiting in line outside a movie theatre and a pompous guy behind him is pontificating to his wife — pompsplaining — about Marshall McLuhan, the prophetic philosopher and educator on culture and technology. Allen gets into a heated argument with the guy, basically saying it’s ok to be totally wrong about McLuhan but just not so loud about it.
The guy self-importantly announces something like, “well I happen to be a professor at Columbia University and I teach a course on culture and media and I know my McLuhan.” To which Woody says, “oh really, well I happen to have Marshall McLuhan right here,” and he pulls the actual living Marshall McLuhan from behind a screen who proceeds to tell the professor, “I heard what you were saying, and you know nothing of my work. How you ever got to teach a course in anything is totally amazing to me.”
Is there any better way to win an argument? “Well, I’ve got Socrates right here and…”
As Woody Allen said, though, “wouldn’t it be great if real life were like this?” Which, of course, it isn’t. In real life, deliverance in an argument is many degrees of separation away.
Except in real life I had this experience (kinda) with a Pulitzer Prize winning poet. It turns out that only two degrees of separation is enough to get a real, live, acclaimed poet to personally settle a question about a poem.
But this was not a movie. In real life, nothing was delivered. I lost the debate.
I organize several poetry reading groups for people who are poetry-curious or poetry-reluctant. I’m no professor, no academic, I’m just an enthusiast who has discovered that it’s not hard to get even poetry-averse people enthused by and often in love with a poem, if the poem is any good.
For one group, I recently gathered a selection of poems about Paris, and one was by a poet whose name and work I was unfamiliar with. I had been hunting specifically for Paris poems so I’m sure I found this one by its title: “In Paris.” I was unfamiliar with the poet but instantly captured by the poem.
The poet is Carl Dennis. I figured I’d look him up to have something to say to the group. To my private (and now public) embarrassment and chagrin, Dennis was unknown to me but was hardly unknown outside my own little orbit. In 2002, he won a Pulitzer Prize in poetry, eclipsing the other two nominees, both of whom were future Pulitzer winners. His poetry has been published in many important magazines and poetry journals, including some I have occasion to read.
I also learned that Dennis taught for years in the English Department at the State University of New York at Buffalo, where the faculty included renowned poets whose names I did know and have even read, like Robert Creeley, Charles Olson, Susan Howe, Anselm Hollo, and Charles Bernstein. (Disclosure: I’m no fan of the “schools” of poetry these poets were part of and I don’t read much of their stuff.)
To make matters even worse for me, I went to SUNY/Buffalo. And I was an English major. And I was learning there (allegedly) while Carl Dennis was teaching there. We were one degree of separation away as I walked past his classroom.
Maybe he only taught graduate students. Or may it was the early 1970’s and I was a long-haired kid from Brooklyn whose main influence was Groucho Marx and Jefferson Airplane. And Dennis really was an unknown poet back then. So our one-degree gap was all it took to keep me in the dark.
But for present purposes, I now had my intro about Dennis for the poetry group. Everyone had a good laugh when I gave this background about my unknown poet, after which I read his poem aloud.
And for a long while no one spoke. You could hear the silent re-reading, the thinking, the unsaid questioning. We were all engaged, provoked by a poem, and, since the poem was about Paris, maybe a little in love. Here’s the poem.
Today as we walk in Paris I promise to focusMore on the sights before us than on the womanWe noticed yesterday in the photograph at the print shop,The slender brunette who looked like youAs she posed with a violin case by a horse-drawn omnibusNear the Luxembourg Gardens. Today I won’t linger longOn the obvious point that her name is as lost to historyAs the name of the graveyard where her bonesHave been crumbling to dust for over a century.The streets we’re to wander will shine more brightlyNow that it’s clear the day of her deathIs of little importance compared to the momentCaught in the photograph as she makes her wayThrough afternoon light like this toward the Seine.The cold rain that fell this morning has given way to sunshine.The gleaming puddles reflect our moodJust as they reflected hers as she stepped around themSmiling to herself, happy that her auditionAn hour before went well. After practicing scalesFor years in a village whose name isn’t recorded,She can study in Paris with one of the masters.No way of telling now how close her lifeCame to the life she hoped for as she rambled,On the day of the photograph, along the quay.But why do I need to know when she herself,If offered a chance to peruse the book of the future,Might shake her head no and turn away?She wants to focus on her afternoon, now almost gone,As we want to focus on ours as we standHere on the bridge she stood on to watchThe steamers push up against the current or ease down.This flickering light on the water as boats pass byIs the flow that many painters have tried to captureWithout holding too still. By the time these boats arriveFar off in the provinces and give up their cargoes,Who knows where the flow may have carried us?But to think now of our leaving is to wrong the moment.We have to be wholly here as she wasIf we want the city that welcomed herTo welcome us as students trained in her schoolTo enjoy the music as much as she didWhen she didn’t grieve that she couldn’t stay
Time steals us all away and leaves photos as proof of existence.
This narrative poem — a dramatic monologue — is teeming with imagery, feeling, and thought. Time, the ephemerality of the moment, Paris, romance, obsession, the flowing Seine, sepia-toned photographs, photography’s power and powerlessness: the group discussed all these things, and more I’m sure.
The speaker is in Paris with his — wife? paramour? friend? — and he knows she is frustrated with him. He’s obsessed with a 19th century photograph they saw in a print shop of a Parisian street scene with a woman carrying a violin case. He can’t stop thinking of the woman, long gone from Paris, faraway from now, and lost to history.
We all could relate to both sides of the poem’s modern-day scenario. On one side of the couple’s dilemma is the seductive power that a photograph has over the narrator (and, by proxy, over us readers). The other side of the dilemma is the “here and now” that the narrator’s companion wants to enjoy while strolling with her man.
Reflecting the narrator’s obsession, the present-day “she” in the poem is barely there. We know much more about the long-gone woman in the photograph. “Enough already,” we imagine the living woman wants to say, but she doesn’t have a voice in the poem. The narrator simply tells us, “She wants to focus on her afternoon, now almost gone.”
But wait! The woman who “wants to focus on her afternoon” is the woman in the old photograph, not the woman in the present. This man cannot stop thinking of that ghost in the image. “Paris is laid out in splendor before you now!” I want to shout at him. “Pay attention to the angel in front of you!” But I cannot reach the inattentive narrator who is just a disembodied “voice” in a poem, just as he cannot reach the woman in a faded image from the 19th century.
Look how he can’t stop himself! He promised — promised! — in the poem’s first line to “focus on the sights before us” rather than on the beguiling antique photograph. “Focus” is what he says — just like a camera does. Perhaps “focus” is not the reassuring word the narrator should have chosen, but it’s honest because his focus keeps returning to the camera’s subject a century earlier. He says he won’t “linger long” on her death, as he clearly already has and proceeds to do some more.
About halfway through the poem, the sun comes out and it seems like our haunted hero is going to come back to the present. He sees how “the gleaming puddles reflect our mood,” and he all but says “honey! I’m home!” But, no, he falls instead through the camera’s time portal back to the muddy puddles that his 19th century inamorata is stepping around as she smiles to herself. At this point in his preoccupation, the narrator exceeds the four corners of the photograph and simply creates unknowable facts about her successful audition and her musical studies.
Just as things are getting a little out of hand, the narrator — and the poem — asks an important question: why does he care what became of his enchantress if she herself, living wholly, didn’t care to “peruse the book of the future”?
Why does he care? What ensnares him? Photography gives us the illusion that we can stop time right — snap! — now. Old photographs let us imagine more fully this vanished place in that vanished time, like the prototypical 1838 photograph of a Paris street, above. They let us meet and look into the eyes of the dead. Haven’t you looked at a photo from, say, Coney Island in the 1920’s and thought “every one of these people is gone”? Or from the 1960’s and wondered “what became of them”?
Time steals us all away and leaves photos as proof of existence.
As if answering the question “why do I care,” the poem now plunges into the river of time with its boats and flickering lights and its Heraclitean flow, never captured in art, that leads who knows where. The narrator is having, perhaps, a mini-Whitmanesque moment, crossing the Seine rather than Crossing Brooklyn Ferry, seeing the same boats the slim brunette saw (“steamers”) and the same flickering lights she saw, and knowing now he must not “wrong the moment.”
When the narrator resurfaces, he knows it is important to be “wholly here.” (“Wholly” is such a perfect word!) Across a century, the woman in old Paris has reminded him that we are here but briefly, like the blink of a camera’s shutter. He comes to see that the city of Paris will “welcome us as students trained in her school/ To enjoy the music as much as she did.” Her school? The Music School of the Holy Here.
So wake up, take your present-day companion’s hand, and watch for puddles.
But there’s a little more to my story about Carl Dennis and Buffalo, New York. Though we might easily have knocked our coffees onto each other’s plaid shirts in the makeshift English Department hallways in, say, 1972, I assumed that 50+ years on, Carl and I had drifted apart to the expected six degrees of separation, or more.
But no, we were a mere two degrees of separation away. Go know! One of the people in the poetry group, Eva, lives in Buffalo. When we read “In Paris” in our group, she said, “Hey, Carl is a neighbor of mine! He lives a couple of houses away.” Wow! So do you know him? “Yeah, of course, but as a neighbor, not as a famous poet.” So cool!
We discussed the poem as a group for a good long time. It felt like we were on that Paris bridge, like we could see the woman in the photograph, like we knew how to be mad at our partners for “wronging the moment” and not being “wholly here” when presence mattered.
But then I pointed out: “look, this poem doesn’t have a period at the end of the last sentence.” It seemed odd to me, and I checked my source for the poem, the Academy of American Poets online. Nope, no period. See for yourself.
What does it mean to leave a poem open-ended like that? Poets don’t do this for no reason, after all. I’m sure I mentioned Emily Dickinson’s defiance of punctuation conventions.
What does the grammatical caesura do in this particular poem?
Does it hint at the continuing, endless nature of Time?
Does it signify something about indeterminacy? but of what? the moment? our relationships?
Are we intended to go back to the start of the poem, like James Joyce made us do in Finnegans Wake (mostly written in Paris!) where the final sentence (“A way a lone a last a loved a long the”) has no period and flows like the River Liffey into the opening sentence (“riverrun, past Eve and Adam’s, from swerve of shore to bend of bay,”)?
I even checked “In Paris” to see if that worked. It does, if you want it to.
Eva said, “I have an idea! I’ll text Carl and ask!” Fantastic! And she did. “Hey, Carl, we’re reading your poem ‘In Paris!’” And he replied something like I can’t believe anybody’s reading that old poem. And she then asked, “what does it mean that there’s no period at the end?”
And much like Marshall McLuhan, he replied, “That’s a mistake. It’s supposed to be there.”
So much for the River Liffey.
Ok, the sepia-toned woman, so busy with living, “didn’t grieve that she couldn’t stay PERIOD.” Got it. Message to the poem’s speaker from two women, one on the bridge now, one there a hundred years ago: when in Paris, be in love or at least be here now. PERIOD.
“In Paris” was published in Dennis’s 1993 poetry collection The Near World. Unlike the poem’s distracted narrator who was focused on the deep past, the poetry group was reading a modern poem written in our lifetimes. But we were like the narrator in one respect: we were enthralled. We were in Paris, and I think we were falling in love with this poem.
And now, weeks after the poetry group discussion, I find myself re-reading Dennis’s poem umpteen times, poring over it like a man staring at a very old photograph while I’m working on this piece. It’s taken all day, and soon my wife and I have somewhere to be. I hear her call from the other room, “It’s time to go. Enough with that poem already!” I am here and it is now and we do have to go.
Because the poem above is exactly what I shared with the group, you’ll note there’s no period at the end. Since I have it on good authority that a period belongs there, I’m duty-bound to offer the correct last line: “When she didn’t grieve that she couldn’t stay.” Ah, so much better!
“In Paris” lead me to Dennis’s books of poetry which are now 14 in total plus one book of essays. I’ve bought several now, including his last, Earthborn. Many colleagues and commenters describe his poetry as thoughtful, sensitive, focused on the everyday, accessible, meditative, humane. All true. But I haven’t found any mention of how funny, how deeply wryly funny, Dennis can be.
In “Primitive,” he refrains from killing a spider in his house in order to avoid the slippery ethical slope toward killing a few people he knows. In “Progressive Health,” he advises healthy organ donors for perfectly ethical reasons not to wait another day before donating their organs. In poems like “Eurydice” and “The God Who Loves You,” you’ll laugh but only to keep from crying. Find them, read them.
The God who loves me whispers that he bets that Carl Dennis likes Groucho Marx and thinks Groucho was a good a preceptor for me in college as any of Carl’s smart colleagues.

Helping You Adapt to Life in France

I’ve strolled past dozens of brocantes (antique fairs) in my decade in France, but it was only last month that I finally had a mission which took me to one as a participant, not just as a passer-by.
I often tell friends that it’s important to commemorate milestones as you get older. When you’re younger perhaps your family or your superiors will do it for you (a graduation, a promotion) but later in life your achievements and milestones can and should be marked in some way. I tend to do this with a gift which I would ordinarily not have bought for myself, but justified because of an achievement. For example, after a month studying French in the Alps I bought myself a Mondaine Swiss Railways watch. I’ve loved the design since the first summer I spent in Switzerland (2014) and was mesmerized by seeing the railway clocks at all the platforms I stood on. It wasn’t until 2018, four years later, that I “decided” to mark my quantum leap forward in French that I made in the Alps with this gift for myself.
That brings us to my citizenship interview of a couple of months ago and a desire to mark the end of several parts of various journeys. I have loved the classic designs of Saint James for some time now, but have put off buying one of their sweaters (jumpers, my dear UK readers) due to cost. Good, long-lasting clothing does cost more, and I’m not hesitant to pay…

Paris is home to the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, the Notre Dame and many more iconic landmarks. It is the city of fashion, haute cuisine and lights. As one of the most popular tourist destinations, it exerts an enormous attraction to people all over the globe: in 2023 it received more international visitors than New York, Bangkok or Mecca.
When we think of Paris, we picture a city with grand boulevards, lined with stately buildings, between which little alleyways meander. Here locals chatter on the outdoor terraces of countless bistros and brasseries while enjoying the culinary delights.
This romantic image of the French capital is true only to some extent. It’s not something the majority of the 11 million inhabitants of the Paris metropolitan area experience in their daily lives. Paris has long outgrown its historic core: most of the people who consider themselves Parisains today live in the city’s suburbs: the banlieues.
The Paris within the Périphérique (the ring road which encircles Paris proper) is world-famous. The suburbs which lay outside it remain mysterious places.
In today’s article, I want to shine a light on Paris’s banlieues: their history, their development and their…

How long do you have to be visiting a city before you start to feel like a local? Or, maybe it has more to do with how you spend your days rather than a length of time. When I spent a week in Paris last year with my best friend, her Apple watch clocked us at about 24,000 steps a day. We did all the usual touristy things: Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Sacre Coeur, the Louvre, etc. But I’ve always longed to visit a foreign city and live like a local instead. Getting to know a city on a deeper level is hard to do when you’re in hardcore tourist mode. So, I decided to pack up my laptop to spend a month working remotely in Paris this summer — with the intention to live like une vrai Parisienne, at least for a little while.
One of my biggest pet peeves is looking like a typical American tourist. It can’t be helped most of the time, but there have been trips where I’ve gone out of my way to avoid it. For example, when I traveled to Turkey for 10 days, I arrived with freshly dyed dark-brown hair and a carefully culled suitcase devoid of sneakers or anything made of denim. Apparently, it worked. A few times, locals spoke to me in Turkish, and a few tourists even stopped me to ask for directions.
This time around, I’m not focused on blending in, especially not clothes-wise. That’s impossible in such a fashion-conscious city filled with genetically chic inhabitants. Besides, I need my comfy shoes. Instead, I want to do more ordinary things to fill my days. Yes, there will be sightseeing on my days off, and of course I will be taking beaucoup photos. But when I walk out the front door of my flat in the 5th arrondissement, I want to “have the air of” a local, as the French would put it.
To me, that means heading to a farmers market to buy the week’s fruits and vegetables, going for a morning run along the Seine, reading Le Monde over my morning coffee, watching French TV, going to a movie theater, listening to French pop music on the radio, reading a book in a park, and cooking myself dinner. I thought about bringing my laptop to a cafe and working there for a few hours, but I’m afraid that it would make me look too American. I’m pretty sure Parisians don’t mix work with pleasure.
I’m hoping that mundane tasks like doing laundry will make me feel more like a local and less like a tourist. I’ll have my own washer and dryer in the flat I’m renting. People don’t usually wash their clothes when they’re staying in hotels, at least not the proper way. My husband admits he once washed his clothes in the dishwasher on a business trip! I’m no better. When I was a teenager, I went on a trip to Europe with my high school, and our first stop was Paris. The bathroom in the hotel room I shared with my friends had a toilet and sink (of course). But it also had this weird “bonus sink” that was lower to the ground and had faucets to turn on hot and cold water. My best guess, being only sixteen, was that it was for washing clothes, so that’s what I did. Not long after, I learned what a bidet was and realized in horror that I had washed my underwear and socks where previous hotel guests had washed their, um, dirty derrières.
Another embarrassing laundry faux pas came only about a decade later while on my honeymoon in Germany and Austria. We were in the alpine city of Salzburg, staying in this lovely hotel recommended by Rick Steves, my favorite travel writer and host of a TV travel show on PBS. We even sported Rick Steves’ official backpacks that I had borrowed from a friend so that we could carry our luggage on our backs like seasoned pros. Well, it didn’t take long for me to get blisters from walking with all that extra weight. When we got to the hotel, I was definitely in the mood to treat myself to a luxury. So, when I saw a white plastic bag hanging in our hotel room closet, I decided to use the hotel’s laundry service instead of washing my socks and underwear in the sink. It wasn’t until I got everything back that I realized it was a dry-cleaning service, not laundry. I was both horrified and oddly impressed at how each pair of socks and underwear was carefully pinned to cardboard and artfully wrapped in tissue paper like little Christmas presents.
Ever since that first trip to Europe as a teenager, I yearned to live abroad someday. I had hopes of being a travel writer like Rick Steves or Bill Bryson and wanted to move to Europe. I also wanted to become fluent in Spanish, a language I had studied in school for eight years but never could master. Alas, none of that was meant to be. But as Edith Piaf would croon: Je ne regrette rien. I regret nothing. I’ve had a fulfilling career as a technical writer for almost 20 years now, and I’ve taken some pretty cool trips, though mostly as a tourist.
Very early in my career, I did have some luck getting a travel article published in my hometown newspaper, the Bristol Pilot. I had decided to do a work abroad program right after college and lived in London for six months on a special visa. After two weeks of pounding the pavements, I landed a job as a receptionist for World Imports, an importer of Mexican beers like Corona and Modelo Negra to the U.K. I had always known that my hometown of Bristol, Pa., was named after Bristol, England, so I decided to take a trip there one Saturday and document my experience. The article was titled “Tales of Another Bristol,” or something like that. It was the only travel article I’ve ever had published.
There was no question about feeling like a local during my London days, that’s for sure. I did mundane things every day. For one, my job as a receptionist was pretty boring. Most of the time I just sat there waiting for the phone to ring. Sometimes I would deliver faxes or make coffee for visitors. A lot of my coworkers spoke Spanish, so to kill time I would practice translating letters and have them check it. Commuting to work was another drag. There were times when I would be running late for work (yet again) all sweaty and out of breath from running for the train, with a big knot in my stomach anticipating getting in trouble by the owner, Alphonso, and I would want to just break down and cry. But I would remind myself that at least I was in London, and that seemed to make it all better.
So, this idea for a 30-day mini adventure in Paris is a small step toward fulfilling a lifelong dream of living abroad, though I’m more into learning French these days than Spanish. In fact, I’ll be attending my twice-weekly French class online while I’m there. With the time difference, it won’t start until midnight! Another adjustment will be my work schedule. I plan to start at 2 p.m. so that I can still make scheduled meetings with my East Coast colleagues, which means I’ll be working into the night. But the upside is I’ll have my mornings free. Also, the sun doesn’t set until 10 p.m. in Paris in the summer, making the days feel longer.
Eventually, I plan to document here on Medium how it all went. Will I feel like a local after only 30 days? Will I get asked for directions while lugging home groceries or doing some other ordinary chore? Will I master the European washer and dryer and other foreign appliances without blowing any fuses? One thing is for certain: If I encounter a vintage bidet somewhere, I’ll know exactly what NOT to do.
Until then, follow my stories on Instagram (@pammypez) or Facebook (@pfassett).

A Data-Backed Travel Guide
After binge-watching Emily in Paris (no judgment, please), I’ve been dying to stroll along the Seine, bite into a flaky croissant, and soak in the city’s magic — art, love, history, the works. But I’m also a data nerd who loves a good deal, so I wasn’t about to splurge on flights.
I gathered flight prices from Singapore (SIN), London (LHR), and New York (JFK) to Paris (CDG) to study travel patterns from different corners of the world — Asia, Europe, and North America — and find the cheapest month to visit Paris in 2025. What I found surprised me: a secret sweet spot where prices drop, crowds thin, and Paris still sparkles — plus a month so overpriced and packed it made me rethink my plans.
Paris reinvents itself with each season, and timing can make or break your trip — especially if you’re budget-conscious. Here’s the quick rundown:
Timing matters because each season shows a different side of Paris — and impacts your wallet.
November is your golden ticket.
Flights from LHR averaged $125, SIN $350, and JFK $300 — the lowest I found all year. Why? It’s late fall in Paris (6–11°C), meaning fewer tourists clogging up the Louvre or the Marais. My price trend plot confirmed it: November was the cheapest across the board. Sure, it’s chilly — pack a scarf and a jacket — but imagine this: you’re sipping hot chocolate by the Seine, golden leaves falling, and you didn’t break the bank to get there. That’s November in Paris.
If November’s too cold for you, consider September to October. My daily price trend plot showed prices stabilizing during this period — before spiking again in late October. Wonder why the stability? Summer’s rush (think families on school break) fades, and demand drops as kids head back to school. September’s still mild (13–21°C), with fewer crowds and scenic fall vibes — perfect for a bike ride along the Canal Saint-Martin. October cools down (9–16°C) but keeps the charm, with autumn colors popping in the Tuileries Garden. Just watch out for late October — prices start creeping up as holiday travel looms.
Here’s the month I’d dodge like a tourist trap: August. My price trend plot showed a steady climb through the month, peaking near the end. Why the spike? It’s peak summer (16–25°C), and Paris is swarming with tourists soaking up the sun. Plus, many Europeans (including Parisians) take their annual holidays, so the city’s packed with visitors while locals escape to the coast. If you hate crowds (and overpaying), August is a hard pass.
My price trend plot revealed a wild ups and downs from June to July. What gives? June is the tail end of shoulder season — still warm (14–23°C), but demand hasn’t peaked. Come July, summer hits full swing: school holidays kick in, Bastille Day (July 14) draws crowds with its parades and fireworks, and Paris becomes the place to be. More demand, higher prices — it’s simple economics, but it stings.
Here’s the deal: book your 2025 Paris trip for November. You’ll save big, enjoy a quieter city, and still get that Parisian magic (pro tip: pack a scarf — it’s chilly).
Have you visited Paris during an off-season month? Did you find hidden deals, or do you think the summer hype is worth it?

Outline of a talk at the Critical University 15 May 2021
If we go back to March 18th, and look at the famous imagery of the National Guard on their barricades, we’re only seeing one half of the story. This is the French labour movement as it saw itself: orderly, respectable and quite obviously gendered — the men have the guns, flags and uniforms, the women and children stand to the side.
The battalions were rooted in local communities but, as Martin Phillip Johnson shows, there was a lot of crossover — so that a man in one area might actually travel to be with friends in another area’s battalion. Which suggests they were based both on community and workplace.
But March 18th itself, and the subsequent trajectory of the Commune as a revolutionary government, involved a completely different demographic: la canaille, the mob: the shanty-dwelling ultra poor, including migrants from outside Paris, overlapped with the classic bohemia of artists, impoverished law students, registered sex workers, slum children… and nobody took their photos, although they drew them.

On 20th May 2024, our most awaited day was here. It was the first day of our fortnight-long planned package tour of Europe. We covered the following countries- Netherlands, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Italy, Slovenia, Vatican, and Germany for a span of two weeks.
This trip was a result of three months of extensive planning and preparation. There were massive discussions and contradictions within our family on which travel agency should we choose, which itinerary, the budget, VISA appointment, purchasing and much more.
We consulted many relatives, friends, family friends, those who have been on a European trip, and much more. At last, we booked our travel with Soman’s Leisure Tours, Kochi. On 30th April, we had our VISA appointment.
On the 10th we had an online meeting with the tour company explaining the guidelines for the trip. They instructed us about currency, international SIM and much more.
18th, Saturday was the day when we started to put together things. Despite that, we could not have successful progress on that. On the 19th we had to go to our ancestral place hence, it was indeed a tight…

Yayyyy!! Its summer, its vacation time.
This Year we are planning to Visit Paris. ( I’ve already been to Paris though )
This would be the 1st time my wife / kid and my in-laws would visit Paris. I quickly wanted to share with you our 3 day Itenerary.
Paris is a city that is full of history, art, culture, and great food (especially if you are into French cuisine). There is no one perfect itinerary for visiting Paris, but here is a suggested 3-day itinerary that will help you get a taste of the best that the capital of France has to offer:
Day 1:
Day 2:
Day 3:
This itinerary will give you a taste of the best (or the most famous) that Paris has to offer, but there is so much more to see and do in this incredible city.
If you have more time, be sure to explore the lesser-known neighborhoods and attractions. Personally, I like the Catacombs, the Père Lachaise Cemetery (graves of Jim Morrison or Chopin, but also a nice walking area) or just visiting Sunday morning local markets…
Plenty to see and do.
If you had something to take away, add a clap / respond / highlight / follow me and subscribe to get emails as soon as I publish. We all go further when we help each other!”
Cheers — KS !!

I think the way French people say, “Bonjour!” is sensuous. Just two syllables. Or two musical notes, rather.
Shopkeepers, waitstaff, and bartenders all seem to sing when they greet me with “Bonjour!” or “Bonjour, monsieur!”
Nothing about me asks to be serenaded. I’m an older American male of Chinese ethnicity, not immediately charismatic, nor sharply dressed, nor classically good-looking, nor anything. On my better days, I could perhaps pass for an expatriate, but more often, I probably come off as a seasoned tourist, which, at least, is accurate.
Everyone gets this greeting, not just me. But alas, not everyone responds in a way that matches the greeter’s sensuality. They should. We could all use a bit more sensuality in our lives, no matter how small.
I wish to blend in, to “live like a local” as many travelers like to say. So, whenever I’m greeted, I feel the need to respond in kind. Thus, I reply, “Bonjour!” in the best French I can muster, which causes me to mimic that same songlike quality. “Bonjour!” I feel better just saying, er, singing it.
For example, I found myself singing at 9:15 am as I entered La Crémaillère 1900 in Montmartre on a chilly, misty April morning. Still sleepy, and before my morning coffee.
Singing “Bonjour!” in response to the server uplifts me. Sure, it’s only two notes, but it’s two more notes than I sing when I enter a café near my home in New York City.
By the way, I wrote my first draft of this story in this café, and all the photos in this article are of this establishment.
If you must ask, I had the “Pain perdu au caramel beurre salé” or “Salted butter caramel French toast.” Yes, it was as sensuously decadent as that reads.
Some say that “Paris est un village,” and I can see why. Few other large cities I’ve experienced greet me like I’m in a small town, but people here do this naturally.
I found out later that all of French society conspires to do this, not just Parisians. French children are consistently taught to say “bonjour” and “au revoir” to their peers and adults. Some say it’s a way to acknowledge another’s humanity.¹
I live in New York City, where we value efficiency. We can’t be bothered with fussy things like greetings, especially with strangers. Often just a direct, “Do you have the time?” or “I’d like a matcha oat latte, please!”
But is it really that fussy? It’s not like I’m being asked to say, “Good day to you, madame. You look quite well today.” Saying “hello” is only two syllables, just like in French!
I’m resolved to acknowledge my fellow New Yorkers’ humanity when I get home. I will sing “Hello!” to all of them, even if things get awkward. Maybe I’ll get a side job at a café or a Lululemon shop. Just for the practice.
Back in Paris, at bustling, understaffed restaurants, harried servers move quickly and efficiently. They don’t smile. They acknowledge me just long enough to indicate, yes, take any available seat. Maybe I’ll get a menu soon, maybe not.
But I always get a tonally cheerful “Bonjour!” paired with firm, if fleeting, eye contact.
The Middle Eastern immigrants working the kebab stalls greet me with a lilting “Bonjour!” The Chinese housekeeping staff at my hotel: “Bonjour!” Service workers who don’t even seem happy with their jobs, at least at that moment: “Bonjour!”
It’s as if those weary service workers are saying, “I’m unhappy right now, but I’m not taking it out on strangers. And so, I will sing because singing is good for my soul. Even if it’s just two notes.”
And if singing one’s troubles is good for one’s soul, does that mean complaining in French is more therapeutic than complaining in English? I’ve heard people complain in French many times, and it’s the cutest thing ever. I feel cathartic just listening to them, and I don’t even know what they’re saying most of the time!
French certainly sounds better than the flatter tones of my American English. In my home country, I hear the French language’s relative musicality exert its influence.
Does it sound more meaningful to say you’re a “hustler” or an “entrepreneur”? (Bonus: Say “entrepreneur” in proper French, with a crooked half-smile and a gleam in your eye for a self-effacing, satirical effect.)
What feels better to say after you emotionally process a major setback? “That’s life!” versus “C’est la vie!”
If you and your partner want to invite a prospective new lover to your bedroom, would you coquettishly propose a “threesome” or a “ménage à trois”?
I’m not an enraptured newbie à la Emily in Paris. This is my seventh time in Paris. I’ve been to other parts of France. I’m actually a sometimes-jaded traveler. I’ve studied French on and off for years.
While I’ve always loved French culture and people, after all these visits, I’m finally noticing and loving the soulful quality I hear in the French language.
That’s all I have about French greetings. Though, we haven’t discussed French farewells, which I find similarly lyrical. I guess you’ll just have to use your imagination when I say (sing):
Au revoir! Bonne journée!
As mentioned, all photos in this article were shot inside this café:
La Crémaillère 1900 (Yelp, Google Maps)

There’s an eclectic, egalitarian art gallery hiding in plain sight in Le Marais district in Paris. Its art pieces coexist with the chic boutiques and charming restaurants this area is known for.
Throughout these winding, intimate medieval streets, perched on walls above eye level (or below, sometimes) are street art pieces.
I love finding them amongst the teeming throngs of tourists. So many tourists. But who am I to hate on them? I’m a tourist myself, and I love Le Marais, just like them.
Several years ago, I did a street art tour of this neighborhood. The tour guide told me that residents here tended to be more tolerant of graffiti and street art. Artists, Bohemians, gays/lesbians, and other groups have at times occupied this area since the late 20th century.
I went back this year.
Just like years ago, it did not disappoint.
All photos in this article were taken by me in Le Marais during my April 2025 trip — except for this one below from December 2017, where I actually caught a street artist in the act!!
I’ve done my best to attribute the artworks that I know.
Back to this year.
I discovered this cute piece below.
I wondered if the raccoon stencil was part of the original piece or if another artist added it later. Did the original artist get annoyed or grudgingly accept it?
You had to walk down a nondescript residential street to find this one:
I don’t know why these artists are into vintage video game characters, but I find them cute.
On the left below is Super Mario by Invader (Official website, Instagram). That famous artist of those Space Invaders video game characters rendered as tile art throughout Paris and beyond.
Did you know there’s a FlashInvaders app that lets you “collect” sightings of Invader’s works? It’s totally a thing.
Below is more street art. I love the various forms and mediums this art can take.
Some pieces were stunningly intricate, as shown below. For pieces that clearly require so much effort, I sometimes wonder if artists seek permission from the building owners first or hope that the virtuosity of the piece earns enough respect to spare its destruction.
Le Marais is already delightful with its shopping, food, and vibes. You would not be faulted for enjoying only these things.
But there’s a playful, subversive layer if you slow down and look closely enough.
Next time you’re here, let your gaze wander more.
Or take a detour down that nondescript alley.
You may be rewarded with some artistic surprises!

Artful storytelling helping inspire women to learn and grow

I love the “City of Stars” music from the recent Oscar-nominated movie, La La Land. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling tenderly whisper their dreams and hopes to the stars, praying for a city of lights filled with love and happiness.
When I hear this song my heart escapes to a magical place where my dreams are admittedly sentimental and gooey. For me, my city of lights shines brightly in Paris.
Every time I’m in Paris I succumb to its winding streets and famous arrondissements. While I have yet to go beyond the city, venturing into Versailles and Fontainebleau, who can blame me? Paris if filled with an endless selection of bottomless bread baskets, silky cheeses and overflowing red wine on almost every Parisian corner. These culinary delights stimulate my blissful escape into the fascinating world of Parisian stories, stretching my imagination across time and well beyond the city’s center at Notre Dame.
Historical French women call out to me like Joan of Arc, from her gable perch on the Sacré Cœur Basilica, and Josephine Bonaparte, as I walk the cobblestone streets in front of Notre Dame. Paris is alive thousands of monuments to women, whose contributions have changed history and opportunities for other women.
In Montmartre, fifteenth century Joan of Arc is one of my favorite musings. She sits to the left of a triumphant King Louis IX. Joan is best remembered for her role in preserving France’s religious faith and national unity. During the Hundred Years War when the English occupied parts of France and threatened its sovereignty, Joan claimed to hear God’s voice telling her to lead the embattled crown prince Charles VII to victory at Orléans.
Joan of Arc’s victorious charge and horrific death as a heretic burned at the stake sealed her fate as one of France’s most cherished saints. But what if Joan had ignored her dreams or had been too afraid to take up the sword, especially since women leading in war front was unheard of at this time?
Joan’s mystic legacy as a great leader and savior of the church is honored in thousands of statues throughout Paris, and to this day she continues to be a subject of great scholarly fascination.
More personally, the golden image of Joan riding on a horse into battle inspires me to feel like anything is possible in life, if you stay true to your beliefs and convictions amidst doubt and controversy.
Of all the fascinating French women of Paris, I could not write their stories without including the most famous one living in the Louvre museum.
Before you say the Mona Lisa shouldn’t be included because she isn’t technically French born, and is only an Italian subject of painter Leonardo Da Vinci’s, hear me out.
I include the Mona Lisa among the most inspiring and transformative French women for two reasons: her portrait was commissioned by the King of France in 1530 and, most importantly, she is the most visited, studied, and best known work of art in the world whose place in Paris is solidified. Essentially, there are no plans for the Mona Lisa to emigrate anytime soon.
Her resting place in the Louvre is an interesting one, after her picture first hung in the gallery of King Francois I at Fontainebleau. Napoleon Bonaparte moved her to his bedroom wall in his Tuileries apartment in 1800 before she took official residence in the Louvre four years later. The Mona Lisa has continued to live in Paris well over 200 years now, and my fixation with her place there is shared with the world.
No doubt her mysterious smile or what the Italians call, sfumato (meaning blurry, ambitious and up to the imagination) is a perfect reflection of the mysterious allure that French women exude. It is an allure that can’t be defined, any more than Nat King Cole tried in his hit song about Mona Lisa’s smile or Columbia Pictures’ attempt to classify her in the 2003 movie, Mona Lisa Smile.
The potential for women to reach new heights and to dream beyond traditional roles is enough to hold me captive. Mona Lisa reminds us of the power of the imagination, even for any doubters who know that Da Vinci predicted many future inventions from flying machines to water inventions.
Mona Lisa is more than a 16th century painting of Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo. Her stature goes far beyond the millions of people who have flocked to see her. She embodies that powerful combination of strength, mystery, creativity and individualism in French women that inspires me to be even more than I already am.
French history is filled with further examples of complex female figures, the last which must be included to understand revolutionary France. During the French Reign of Terror in 1793, Josephine Tascher de La Pagerie was married to a prominent Viscount named Alexandre de Beauharnais. Alexandre was executed by guillotine for being an aristocratic sympathizer but his wife Josephine was saved from the same fate thanks to her quick intellect.
Parisian women still recount Josephine’s ingenious escape. Josephine walked up the steps of the platform to meet her death but fainted in front of a huge crowd gathered at Notre Dame. Claiming she was with child, she knew the Catholic laws protected the execution of an innocent child so her life would be spared. Able to wait out the political unrest in jail Josephine was released when the final coup d’état ended.
Josephine would reappear on these same steps of Notre Dame to be crowned Empress years later when she married Napoleon Bonaparte. After her prison release she became a popular leader in Paris society and caught the fancy of Napoleon, a young rising officer in the army. She used her position to advance his political fortune, and when they married in a civil ceremony Josephine insisted on a second ceremony at Notre Dame after his coronation as Emperor on December 1, 1804.
During their reign, Josephine fought for social and political reforms and joined a movement of women called the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, whose demands included equal rights for women and economic reforms in Paris. Participating in a march that included over seven thousand armed women, Josephine took to the streets and protested at the Hotel de Ville and later Versailles.
Josephine secured her title as Empress with Napoleon even after he divorced her because she could not produce an heir. Despite her new status, she remained politically astute and helped assuage the marriage of her daughter, Hortense, to Napoleon’s brother Louis, and her son Eugene’s marriage to the daughter of the King of Bavaria.
When you consider Josephine’s historical legacy, her ancestry of five dynasties still reigns in Northern Europe, in the ruling families of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, and in Luxembourg. In fact, she is even connected to Princess Diana and her son William, who will become the next King of England. How’s that for a city of lights and an Empress of all Empires?
Parisian women have changed the course of history in France and throughout the world. The new reign of terror attacks are not enough to dampen my appetite for Paris, as I stand in solidarity with them. The French commitment to helping America in its struggle for independence lives on in our Lady Liberty statue, a gift from the French designed by Auguste Bartholdi.
As she clutches the Declaration of Independence and steps out of the British chains that lay at her feet, I know France will always have a special place in my heart. This power is underscored by its women and captured in a diary entry by Napoleon to his future wife, Josephine. In it, he writes to her saying,
“I awake filled with you. Your portrait and yesterday’s intoxicating evening left no repose for my senses. Gentle, incomparable Josephine, what a strange effect you have on my heart!”

“When you make a decision as a mayor, you immediately see positive and negative effects.” says Ms Anne Hidalgo, Mayor Paris
Since becoming the first female Mayor of Paris in 2014, Anne Hidalgo has championed an ambitious vision to make the French capital a global leader in sustainability and urban environmental innovation. Her policies, rooted in combating climate change and enhancing the quality of life for Parisians, have reshaped the city’s landscape, reduced its ecological footprint, and set a benchmark for cities worldwide. Hidalgo’s work reflects a commitment to nature, social equity, and a forward-thinking approach to urban living, earning her international acclaim, including a spot on TIME’s 2024 TIME100 Climate list. This article explores her transformative efforts to foster a greener Paris and secure a better future for its residents.
A Vision for a Greener Paris
Hidalgo’s tenure has been defined by bold environmental policies aimed at reducing pollution, prioritizing sustainable mobility, and reintegrating nature into urban spaces. Her overarching goal is to make Paris a “15-minute city,” where essential services—shops, schools, workplaces, and green spaces—are accessible within a short walk or bike ride. This concept, championed by Hidalgo and urban planner Carlos Moreno, seeks to reduce car dependency, enhance community living, and mitigate climate impacts.
Her initiatives reflect a holistic approach to urban planning, balancing ecological resilience with social inclusion.
Revolutionizing Urban Mobility
One of Hidalgo’s most transformative achievements has been her push to reduce car dominance in Paris, a city historically shaped by automotive culture. Since 2014, her administration has added over 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) of bike lanes, making cycling a viable and safe option for commuters. The “Plan Vélo” initiative has expanded cycling infrastructure, with dedicated lanes and bike-sharing schemes like Vélib’ becoming integral to Parisian life. Posts on X highlight the scale of this transformation, noting that Paris has built “+800km new bike paths” and reduced car traffic by 40% under Hidalgo’s leadership.
Hidalgo has also pedestrianized key areas, transforming the Seine riverbanks into car-free zones reserved for walkers and cyclists. The “Paris Respire” (Paris Breathes) initiative bans traffic in certain areas on Sundays and holidays, encouraging residents to reclaim public spaces. Major roads, including stretches along the Seine and iconic plazas like Bastille and Nation, have been redesigned to prioritize pedestrians and public transport. These efforts have led to a 40% drop in air pollution since 2014, significantly improving environmental health.
To further deter car use, Hidalgo introduced policies targeting high-polluting vehicles. Diesel vehicles have been banned from Paris by 2024, with all fossil fuel vehicles phased out by 2030. A parking tax on gas-guzzling SUVs and mandatory emissions stickers for cars entering the city reinforces these measures. These policies not only reduce emissions but also incentivize cleaner transport alternatives, aligning with Paris’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.
Greening the Urban Landscape
Hidalgo’s commitment to nature is evident in her ambitious tree-planting and urban greening programs. Since taking office, Paris has planted over 200,000 trees, with a pledge to add 170,000 more by 2026. Urban forests are being created near landmarks like the Hôtel de Ville, Gare de Lyon, and Opéra Garnier, with plans to cover 50% of the city with planted areas by 2030. A notable project is the transformation of the area from the Trocadéro to the Eiffel Tower into a 56-hectares wooded park, set to become a “green lung” for the city.
In 2022, Hidalgo announced plans for a 3.5-hectare urban forest in the 20th arrondissement, planting over 2,000 trees to combat heatwaves and enhance biodiversity. Her administration has also relaxed building codes to encourage residents to plant trees in their neighborhoods, fostering community-driven greening. These efforts address urban heat island effects, with Paris preparing for projected heatwaves exceeding 50°C (120°F) in coming decades.
Hidalgo’s vision extends to iconic landmarks. The Champs-Élysées, one of the world’s most famous avenues, is being reimagined as a “fantastic garden” by 2030, with wider sidewalks, more trees, and reduced car lanes. These projects not only enhance Paris’s aesthetic appeal but also improve air quality and urban resilience.
Making the Seine Swimmable
A hallmark of Hidalgo’s environmental legacy is her commitment to cleaning the Seine River, a symbolic and practical endeavor. Decades of pollution rendered the Seine unsafe for swimming, but Hidalgo promised to make it swimmable by the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Her administration invested heavily in wastewater treatment and stormwater management, resulting in a cleaner river. In July 2024, Hidalgo herself swam in the Seine to demonstrate its safety, a highly publicized moment that underscores her commitment to environmental progress.
The Olympics provided a platform to showcase sustainable urban practices. Temporary venues minimized new construction, single-use plastics were restricted, and equipment was redistributed for reuse. These efforts halved emissions compared to the 2012 London Olympics, aligning with Paris’s carbon-neutral ambitions.
Global Leadership in Climate Action
Hidalgo’s influence extends beyond Paris through her roles in global climate networks. As chair of C40 Cities from 2016 to 2019, she advocated for urban climate leadership, emphasizing the role of cities in meeting Paris Agreement goals. In 2023, she was appointed a Global Ambassador for the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy, where she pushes for city-level climate financing and ambitious emissions targets. Her work with figures like Michael Bloomberg and other mayors has fostered international collaboration on green policies.
Hidalgo’s leadership during the 2015 COP21 summit, where the Paris Agreement was adopted, cemented her reputation as a climate advocate. She co-hosted the Climate Summit for Local Leaders, empowering cities to set bold emissions targets. Her global advocacy underscores her belief that local actions drive systemic change, a principle reflected in Paris’s recognition with a UN Climate Action Award at COP26.
Visionary Leader
Ms Hidalgo argues that her policies, though polarizing, are necessary to address the climate crisis, a stance echoed by supporters like the former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who called her a “visionary leader.”
A Legacy for the Future
Her decade-long tenure has left an indelible mark on Paris, transforming it into a model of sustainable urban living. From reducing emissions by 25% between 2004 and 2018 to creating 45 kilometers of new parks and 180 car-free “school streets,” Hidalgo’s policies have prioritised nature and human-centric urban design.
Her work has inspired cities globally, proving that bold local action can address planetary challenges. As Paris prepares for a future of climate resilience, Hidalgo’s legacy—bike-filled streets, verdant parks, and a swimmable Seine—stands as a testament to her unwavering commitment to nature and a better future. In her words, “We have to dare, because tomorrow it will be too late.
Regards and a respectful salute to this great Climate Leader and Citizen Of Mother Earth, Ms Anne Hidalgo. It is because of the climate action by world citizens and leaders like you, life on Earth is safe for all living beings.

Since learning that the Louvre is undoubtedly the biggest art museum in the world, I have always been keen to visit this famous sight. My partner and I are both artists, and he wanted to see the Louvre, too. The only problem was that neither of us had any desire to visit Paris, and in fact, we were both a bit intimidated by it.
I can’t say exactly why this was. Maybe it was purely the fact that Paris is the most visited city in the world, and we tend to try to stay away from tourist traps as much as possible. Maybe it was because we heard that Parisians hate foreigners who don’t speak French.
It also might be because we heard that Paris is one of the pickpocket capitals of the world. And, oh yeah, we had heard that people were rude and unwelcoming.
Whatever the reasons were, they are long lost in my memory now because I can firmly say that Paris was not one of the stereotypes we had heard, and both of us were pleasantly surprised by the city and its residents.
I’ve said it before, and I will say it again: traveling to a place and experiencing it yourself is the only way to truly understand it. Trying to decide if…

Prior to parenthood, I lived in Paris, married a Frenchman, and enjoyed la bonne vie in our 12th arrondissement neighborhood between the Bastille and the Gare De Lyon. I buffed up my French, eked out a living writing and leading walking tours, and frittered away many a glorious day in open-air markets, museums, and cafes. Then came a move to America after several years in France, and before I knew it, ten years had passed without a trip back to my favorite city. I decided that the time had come to rediscover Paris — and that my young daughter would make a perfect traveling companion. Not that Camille would be inclined to spend hours admiring Picassos or sampling French cuisine. Like many kids, she pooh-poohs art museums and “weird” food. Rather, her raison d’etre in Paris was to rocket to the top of the Eiffel Tower. So, with that in mind, we kissed Dad goodbye, reiterated cat-care instructions, and set out to spend two weeks in France.
My mission when traveling long distances with my daughter is to plan activities that she will look forward to, then have a backup in case Plan A unravels. During our first days in Paris, we stuck close to our flat in the 2nd arrondissement and saved exuberant excursions for the mornings, when we had more stamina. We began with a 10-minute walk to the Centre Georges Pompidou, also known as Beaubourg.
“Pompidou! Is there really someone named Pompidou?” giggled Camille, gaping at one of the three most widely visited cultural site in the France.
“Of course,” I replied. “Pompidou was a French president who liked modern art.”
“Is that modern art?” she gasped, staring at the tangle of pipes and tubes looming above our heads.
People flock to Beaubourg for various reasons–the mishmash of modern architecture, the dance and theatrical spaces, the cavernous modern art museum on the fourth floor–but foremost, it is a fine family venue. Admission is free for kids, and there is plenty of room to move around, with a stew of mimes, musicians, jugglers, and portrait artists to entertain everyone standing in line. Our favorite part of the visit, though, was the panoramic view from Pompidou’s glass escalator.
“There it is, Mom,” shouted Camille, spotting the Eiffel Tower.
“And over there is Notre Dame and Quasimodo’s bell tower,” I pointed out as I thought about lunch. Because of the time change, Camille and I always seemed to be hungry. Outside, we grabbed two seats at one of the creperies surrounding the Fontaine Stravinsky, which boasts an array of whimsical figures that spiral and spit water in the air.
Feeling very French, I ordered a salmon crepe for me and a sugar one for Camille.
“What’s that?” cried my daughter, glaring at the thin, speckled brown pancake being placed in front of her. “It’s not like the crepes we eat at home!”
“It’s a French buckwheat crepe from Brittany,” I explained.
“I don’t like it, Mom. It looks strange.”
In a city where food is art, eating would become our biggest challenge. A litany of complaints accompanied each meal: The cheese smelled like bad breath, the mustard was the wrong shade of yellow, and the crème fraÎche wasn’t real whipped cream.
“Eat,” I implored, sounding like my mother. “There is no better food on the planet than here.”
After the crepe meltdown, we agreed on a culinary compromise, starting with croissants and cocoa for breakfast. Two blocks from our flat, we hit the croissant jackpot on rue Montorgueil. This cobblestone lane is a quintessential slice of French life. Vendors proudly hawk pretty produce from wooden carts as Frenchmen, heads buried behind Le Monde, sip thimble-size cups of coffee at sidewalk cafes. The bonus on the block, though, is La Pâtissier Stohrer, the oldest family bakery in Paris, boasting crusty croissants that are considered by many the best in the city.
Lines! If the Guinness Book of Long Lines existed, the Eiffel Tour would top the chart. Rain or shine, there’s always a huge crowd winding around the tower.
“Achh,” I groaned the afternoon we visited, calculating the four-hour wait.
“Forget the elevator, Mom,” said Camille. “Let’s climb to the top. It’s a shorter line.”
It certainly was: Forty-five minutes later, we were on our way up the mighty monument. “Ooh la la, look at Paris!” I exclaimed as we arrived at the tower’s second tier, mercifully the maximum for climbers. Feeling giddy, we took turns taking pictures in every direction.
The next day, we set out to find what my hometown newspaper calls “the best crepes in Paris.” On rue Cler in the 7th arrondissement, we joined a gaggle of crepe aficionados and watched a monsieur drop dollops of ivory batter onto a grill. Thirty seconds later, he flipped the bubbling batter and slathered it with chocolate. “Now these are real crepes,” said Camille, licking her fingers.
To get around, we purchased a Paris Visite card for unlimited bus and metro travel. The metro sprints across Paris as quickly as one can take a shower, but with a drawback: It’s underground, passing below all the sights we came to Paris to see. So, we reserved the metro for night outings or when we were in a hurry and otherwise crisscrossed Paris on city buses.
In the five years I lived in the city, I managed to avoid the Bateaux Mouches, a one-hour boat excursion that glides through the Seine with an invisible guide who booms out information about historical sights over a loudspeaker. Camille couldn’t wait to board the boat with the rest of the romantics and tourists. Afterward, we agreed it’s the fastest and coolest way to see Paris.
Eight is a grand age for kids to discover the world. They’re not tied to a parent’s hip, and they make friends easily. They’re curious and energetic, and anything new is still cool. But that doesn’t mean every day is hunky dory, even in Paris. One big challenge I faced in traveling solo with my daughter was finding moments when we could each relax in our own way. After a week on the go, tempers frayed. I reigned in the sightseeing and changed tactics, letting Camille sleep late while I savored coffee on the balcony. We discovered small playgrounds filled with children. Ultimately, I indulged my daughter in some of my favorite French frivolities.
Our feet were first on the list. Finding the perfect pair of red tennis shoes on the rue de Rivoli swallowed a chunk of one day, so afterward we skipped lunch and ordered two banana splits in the first cafe we spied along the Seine. Our most exciting moments were similarly unexpected and often free: puppeteers and musicians performing on stone bridges, skateboard competitions near monuments, and watching the Eiffel Tower light up the night like a trillion twinkling stars. One afternoon, we peeked into the pyramid at the Louvre, made a wish, picnicked in the Jardin des Tuileries, rode the Ferris wheel there three times, and conked out by 9 p.m.
We reserved one day for a country outing and chose Monet’s gardens in Giverny, arriving before the crowds on an early train. We loved the lemon-colored lilies cloaking the ponds, the family photos inside Monet’s house, and the tiny tearoom in town.
Suddenly, our days in Paris were dwindling. Sitting along the Seine savoring mango ice cream cones, we mapped out our last adventure: the five-story museum of science and technology at La Villette, which houses a planetarium, greenhouse, submarine, Géode, and more hands-on treasures than we could possibly experience in a day. The fluorescent anatomy section, lighting up the circulatory system, was my favorite. Camille preferred broadcasting a weather report from the museum’s television studio. I found the old-fashioned waterwheel illustrating the relationship between energy and water clever, and Camille gave the greenhouse rave reviews.
On our last night in France, we donned snazzy duds and our new shoes, took the metro to the Left Bank, and devoured a pizza in an outdoor restaurant on Boulevard Saint Germain. We topped off the evening with dessert at Deux Magots, the famous cafe where Simone de Beauvoir and Sartre often sat. It was here that Camille made her confession: “I love Paris, Mom, and I’d love to come with you again. There’s just one problem said my bilingual daughter : I don’t think anyone here understands you, because you speak really bad French!”
“You’re kidding!” I said in my best French. C’est pas vrai!

A few years ago, sometime in late 2022, I moved to France. Paris, to be exact.
I had just been accepted into the American University of Paris. The pandemic was winding down finally, the world was opening up and I decided that I wanted to take a leap of faith and move abroad for a few years.
Like a lot of young Americans, I was deeply convinced that life in Europe — France, to be exact — was going to be a better experience for me than back home. Looking back now I can see my naïvety from a mile away but, to be fair, I had been raised on years of positive, effusive press which often overlooks the dark side of living in Europe, the less-than-ideal reality of France, and my own family members’ longing(s) to escape the United States.
My first year or so in Paris were great, and fun. It was admittedly nice to be outside my comfort zone, in a place I wasn’t really all that familiar with, in a city I had only ever vacationed in. But as I began to “settle” into the city, I felt this lingering sense of discomfort start crawling over me. My first Parisian apartment, in the 7th, so close to the Eiffel Tower I could practically see it from my window, started to feel like an isolating prison. I felt frustrated, depressed, and mind-numbingly bored, but I wasn’t entirely sure if it was just stress from my studies or something else coming up to the surface. I think in many ways I was afraid to acknowledge the truth.
Then my mother died unexpectedly from cancer in the spring of 2024 and my life changed overnight. Home in the States for a few months dealing with her affairs, I had a lot of time to think about my life so far and whether or not I was truly following the right path.
The answer to that was a very resounding NO.
So, I made the painful but necessary decision to move back home, back to the United States, back where I really belong.
France was an okay experience, but it was not really all that people crack it up to be. There was only so much of France and Europe I think one can take before you eventually want to melt into a puddle, cease existing. I tried so hard to “fit into” a culture that would never accept me, never see me for who I really was, that inevitably I was beginning to crack and fall apart. And I tried, very hard, even after my mom died to make it work, but one day I woke up and realized I couldn’t do it anymore. I had to leave, go home, and put my life back together correctly.
Paris is beautiful, yes, but its beauty is, I came to realize, a kind of stifling and suffocating, pretentious, superficiality. When you first move here, it’s glorious to see old Haussmanian apartments towering above you, all in various shades of black and gray, especially when coming from American suburbia. But eventually, you start to notice the decay and depressive energy emanating from these blocks of grubby cement and stone — you see greenish mildew oozing from cracks in buildings, French doors moldering in the corners, rust chewing away at the fancy black banisters. Walking along the wide boulevards is both a dream and a nightmare, because the moment you turn down a corner you inevitably spend the majority of your time hopscotching over poopy pies (most canine but not all), puddles of fresh stinking ochre urine, and other nasty icky things like discarded underwear and who knows what else.
The food here eventually began to drive me crazy. Repetitive, bland, and boring, I began to crave, desperately, a plate of sizzling hot Thai stir fry with basil and chilis and onions and garlic. Or a delicious juicy burger with beef that tastes sweetly of grass and sunshine and not sweat and ammonia, melting in your mouth as opposed to becoming a chewy, grainy mess between your teeth. I missed the variety of produce and snacks at my local Albertsons grocery store, apples like jewels and luscious greens just beckoning to be chopped into stew, being able to make pretty much any dish I could possible think of without having to run around half of Paris to find a tiny bit of garam masala. And don’t even get me started on things like pickles. What do the French have against salty, crunchy, vinegary pickles? I hate those little petite cornichons with their mushy texture and sickly sweet aroma. Of course I could make them, as my grandmother showed me how well enough, but in my middling Parisian kitchen, it was hard to find space to fit a jar of cucumbers, mellowing away in their salted brine, amongst all the other shit I inevitably accumulated. It’s not a crime to want for convenience or simplicity; sometimes, all I wanted was to come home after a long day of classes, papers, and exams to a simple and delicious meal without feeling like I was trapped between McDonald’s and pasta in my choices.
And every time I left Paris for more than a month, I would come back feeling as though the city somehow became a little worse off than before. A little poorer, darker, more negative, less appealing. I think Parisians would like to imagine themselves a living in a bustling metropolis, à la New York, which I find laughable having recently been in NYC myself. Paris is nothing like New York, or London, or even Tokyo or Shanghai or Los Angeles. Even fucking Toronto is more interesting than Paris.
Paris is, at best, a glorified village — it has all the feelings of one, too. Twee and pretentious and conservative in all the wrong ways, clinging to traditions that no one cares about, turning its nose up at innovation and change as though its a crime to experiment and be creative. I found it ironic that in New York, I felt as though I could breathe. Not necessarily because the air was better, but simply because I felt like I could just be myself. No stares as I went about my day alone as apparently, being a single woman without a man or a friend in tow is somehow scandalous (who knew). No funny looks when wearing something other than the usual scarf + nappy old coat combo (the horror). Not having to glower at people over my shoulder as they clip my heels walking at super-sonic speeds down narrow and uneven streets, all to inevitably turn into a smoke shop or some coffeehouse to stand around and do nothing. Not feeling as though I need to explain, or justify my existence to anyone, or anything.
Plus, I’ve had some pretty hair-raising experiences in regards to crime and general grubby, scummy behavior that have made simple things like getting a taxi or even walking down the street more anxiety inducing than I think they need be. Of course we should always practice vigilance wherever we go, but I think when it gets to point you always feel a kind of simmering nervousness about innocent people walking behind you or second-guessing whether or not your taxi driver might pull a fast one on you, something is obviously wrong. Tourists and locals laugh off the crime (and its increase) as though it was funny and quirky but deep down, again, everyone knows it’s not a good sign. Not just now but of the state of things to come.
I haven’t even touched on the racism, the prejudices you inevitably run into, the rampant xenophobia, particularly towards Americans, which begins to weigh on your psyche. As expats/immigrants, we’re given a litany of things (literally! my university would often send lists out) we can’t do in Paris, or else. You try your very best to “fit in” and assimilate, but eventually it gets to the point where you’re just dimming your light to satisfy someone else’s mediocrity, and it actually made me angry a little. Why does everyone need to conform, go along with the crowd, not stand out, not be an individual? Have an opinion that isn’t like Jacques or Emilie’s, which also happens to be the same opinion of nearly every other person you meet? Why is it a crime to smile widely, laugh heartily, or feel passionately? I am not interested in living life in muted sepia tones all day every day, sorry! And trying to make connections with other expats was a nightmare in and of itself: I could never accept the habitual mistreatment, backhanded comments, two faced behavior, cattiness, and other bull that many American expats often put up with just to be accepted by Parisians and, in general, the French and many other Europeans. After about the second time of some random nobody making incredibly offensive and often racist personal digs at me, my intelligence, or my appearance, I had to call it quits.
I could go on, but the gist of things is…I eventually came to appreciate America more than I did when I first left. I missed all the wonderful things about this country we take for granted — our humor, our food, our culture, our nature, everything. I missed the deep, deep blue skies of California, the diversity of cities like New York and Los Angeles, the beauty of states such as Wyoming or Montana. I missed the smell of the desert and the sea mingling in the air in downtown LA, the sweet humid perfume of the bayou in deep country Louisiana where my relatives live. I even missed our shitty politicians, our goofiness, our earnestness. I missed it all, so, so much, in a way that it was almost like a hunger. I longed for all those experiences, the history, and my connection it. I realized I was fine with being “American”, and all the good and bad connotations that come along with it. I don’t have time or the energy anymore after my mom’s death to care so much about putting on airs or trying to pretend to be something I am not. Take it or leave it, it’s who I am and will always be.
Of course it took me running away for a while to see it again.

First of all, before somebody complains, yes, France is not Paris. I am writing this as somebody who spends his time in Paris which is currently my equivalent to France.
After one week spent at the home of a friend in Chatou I moved out to have more chances discovering Paris and specifically Paris in the evening and taking care for myself. Frankly spoken, the second week (or first week after leaving my friend’s home), I spent at a hotel (Hipotel Paris Gambetta République, 20. Arr., 236 Rue des Pyrénées, 75020 Paris), so there’s not much about caring for yourself with cooking, cleaning and co.
The hotel I booked wasn’t luxurious nor exclusive. But it was charming and so was the neighborhood. And it gave me a first glimpse of what life is like there. The Rue des Pyrénées in the 20th Arrondissement is a nice street. Crowded, vibrant, and welcoming. When I left the hotel, everything you need to live was available in a radius of a five-minute walk.
In the area I had four supermarkets (supermarché like Carrefour City, Franprix, U Express, Picard for frozen products and other, smaller ones), bars and restaurants, stores (magasins) for e.g. fruits and vegetables, bakeries (boulangeries), butchers (boucheries), laundries (laveries), post offices, police, hospital, an elementary school (ecole) and so on.
My hotel provided a water heater for tee (and probably soups). So, without a kitchen, I used to go out dining. This, you can imagine, is not always cheap. But it was a way to discover different cuisines if it was halal.
Among others I visited an Indian restaurant, Sohna Punjab. It has been the first time I ever visited an Indian restaurant and I don’t regret it. I like spicy food and Sohna Punjab had spicy food. It was tasty and filling. Other restaurants I visited were a Turkish pizzeria and a Turkish diner across the street. Many Turkish restaurants, right? Right. I enjoy Turkish food.
Of course I didn’t just eat. I used to walk around to discover Paris. And I wasn’t looking for main attractions, but for the city itself. During my first week in Chatou, I saw the suburbs of what I would say was the middle-class or upper middle-class. Now it was about Paris itself. I most of the time walked in the 20th, 19th, 10th and 12th arrondissement.
Of course, I did it partly with my bicycle, even though I didn’t ride as often as I planned. This, I hope, is about to change.
Did I go shopping? Did I spend money on souvenirs? No, I didn’t. Apart from the fact that for future travel I don’t need more weight in my luggage, I had no interest in getting more plastics or decoration to stuff my future home. What I’ve bought was a magnet for my cousin. She loves magnets and so I got her one when I — you guessed right — discovered Paris and — right again — went to a restaurant (right, Turkish).
You can walk miles and miles in Paris. You surely don’t have to. Paris offers a lot of busses, trains and subways (Metro). But I barely use them if there’s no need to. I prefer walking, with my rucksack (sac a dos) on my back. Or, of course, with my bicycle. As I have already said, I didn’t spend as much time on riding, so I only rode the bike from Chatou to the 20th Arrondissement and then, later, I cruised a bit more than 11 kilometers in the 20ths.
And this is not all. Before moving to the new apartment, I used to visit Montmartre. Montmartre is a neighborhood in the 18th arrondissement, in the shadow of the church Sacre Coeur. I went there by using my feet. This is why I walked through areas surrounding the Garre de Nord. In some guides people say these areas were the most dangerous ones in Paris. When I’ve been walking in these areas, I didn’t feel threatened, but I realized that it was dirtier, poorer. It was the Paris you don’t see often in travel reports.
The contrast between the tourist hotspot Sacre Coeur and Montmartre (which lost the charm of an artist neighborhood to an overpriced tourism hotspot) couldn’t be wider. Souvenir shops, all selling the same stuff, and diners and restaurants selling over-sugared food, are welcoming tourists looking for a nice snapshot of Paris. I don’t blame the tourists, but the attractiveness of the city, I assume, is changing the identity of a city to please them with food (yes, I ate Turkish often, you’re right) which makes you feel that the city turns into a funfair. Despite that, I like Paris. And this is the reason, why I extended my stay in the city.
If you want to read more about my stay in Paris, visit my profile again. More posts are being published in the future. In the next article I will talk about living in the 17th Arrondissement, the Champs-Elysees, the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower at night.

After planning the trip for over a year, we were finally here. Our bags having been dropped off at the hotel, my wife, Sarah, and I were on a walk through Les Marais in Paris. Yes, that’s Paris, France. I had to remind myself a couple of times on this first walk just to be sure.
Then we turned a corner and the Seine itself coursed away in front of us. Notre Dame stretched to the sky and its glory was somehow undimmed by the scaffolding that has adorned it since the fateful fire in 2019. Then finally, after walking a few miles, grabbing dinner, and taking an Uber when our legs wouldn’t carry us one step further, we saw the Eiffel Tower. We were here.
That split second of traveler euphoria was quickly squelched as — no more than a minute after we had stepped out of the Uber — the rain started. It was slow at first. Sun was even breaking through and splashing over the famous curved iron. But then the rains really came.
We tried to hail an Uber, but none were available — probably because we were now part of a growing throng of people huddled underneath the measly branches of landscaped trees near the queue for the Tower. We looked at each other through rain-soaked eyelashes; our clothes were drenched.

I was 32 years old when I got the email that brought me to France. By then the course of my life looked pretty much circumscribed. Like many English people I spoke no foreign languages, and there was little to indicate that I would one day live abroad, apart from a taste for subtitled films, croissants and novels in translation.
Weekday mornings I took the Tube to my mildly enjoyable job at an advertising trade magazine, picking up a copy of The Times to read along the way. At weekends I ate pub lunches and ambled in the park and spent hours buried in the Sunday papers, just like everyone else. True, I travelled quite a bit — but nobody asked me to stay.
Then it came, out of the blue. A mail from somebody called François. I wish I’d kept it — but no. Still, the essence of it was: “We’re launching an English-language magazine in Paris and we’re looking for an editor. Your name has come up. Interested?”
Long story short, I moved to Paris.
I arrived on the day before my birthday, so the date is easy to remember. Today, the day I’m writing this post, marks my 20th year here. And I can tell you, it’s gone by in a flash. Yet so much has happened: love, marriage, a son, changes of address and changes of fortune.
But that’s not why you’re here. What you want to know is: how does living abroad for so long change you as a person?
In essence, I think, you keep the best of your homeland and jettison the rest. And you’re also free to adopt the most appealing aspects of your new home and pretty much ignore everything else.
Becoming Franglais
Let’s start with England. I kept the sense of humour — that was a given. I also retain an old-fashioned sense of courtesy. I’m chatty yet respectful with waiters, taxi drivers, store security guards, shop assistants…everyone, in fact. My (French) wife often remarks on how polite I am on public transport — not a very Parisian characteristic. My colleagues tell me I’m “a gentleman”. But this comes with a wariness of causing offence that can prevent me from speaking my mind — something my wife feels is tantamount to hypocrisy. “Is that your real answer?” she’ll say, after asking my opinion. “Or your English answer?”
I kept a whole roster of English-language films and books and poems that remain dear to me. And I still don’t mind the rain.
I lost my patriotism. I was never xenophobic, but learning another language has definitely made me more open. I recall stating quite often that London was the greatest city in the world, but I’ve revised that opinion. We all know where the “Britain is best” attitude led. Living in France has enabled me to understand the cultural jigsaw puzzle of Europe and see Britain’s place in it. When that piece went missing, I was appalled.
Yet at the same time, I wasn’t entirely surprised. There is a yobbish, jingoistic subculture in the UK that has always scared and disgusted me. Those groups of drunken young men stumbling around town on Saturday nights. I was delighted to leave them behind. Along with football. “Soccer”, if you prefer. The first conversational gambit of almost every British male. No, I don’t support a team. No, I didn’t see the match. And no, I’m really not interested in talking about it.
Food, now that’s interesting. It doesn’t take a French person long to get onto the subject — and I’ve become like them. I can hold my own on the wine front, too. In fact I’ve become addicted to bistros and brasseries, and a basket of bread with every meal.
But there’s also a particular sort of family meal here. It’s long and garrulous, with many courses and lots of debate, some of it heated. After my first dinner with my now-wife’s family, I asked her in amazement: “Do you always speak to your parents like that?”
Living in France has taught me a different way of being a family member. Be close. Be present. Show affection. We have dinner with Géraldine’s parents every Saturday — something I would never have imagined doing with my own parents, still less my partner’s.
Joie de vivre, actually
I’ve developed a different relationship to work and money. Back in London, people worked hard. They arrived at work early, they grafted, their lunch was often a sandwich at their desk. I respected them for that. Living in London is expensive, and you have to earn your keep. You can always de-stress in the pub at night.
In Paris it’s different. It irritated me at first. In my neighbourhood I’d try to go to the bank and the dry cleaner at lunchtime — and they were shut. The sandwiches on sale in supermarkets and even boulangeries were surprisingly bland: there’s only so much ham and cheese you can eat. The restaurants and the café terraces, on the other hand, were packed. What was it with these people? Didn’t they have work to do?
Yes, they did. But they also had lives to live. Friends to see. Small pleasures to enjoy. In general — and I’ve just checked this with my wife — French people are suspicious of the rich and bemused by workaholics. They are not lazy. But they don’t put work and money at the centre of their lives. One day, I got that. So instead of complaining, I decided to try their approach. The next day I was sitting on a café terrace at lunchtime, eating fillet of salmon with ratatouille and sipping a glass of rosé. I returned to work happy and motivated. I’m sorry, but the French have totally won lunchtime.
Emotionally, as well, I’ve become a little more French. I’m less afraid to show sadness, or anger — or even, indeed, fear. I’m no longer convinced that a stiff upper lip is the best expression to adopt.
I’ve also come to understand the concept of loyalty, which felt somewhat abstract back home. French people don’t have the easy familiarity of Americans, or the chirpy amiability of Brits, but once they decide that you’re a friend, they’re in it for life. Restaurants here work in a similar way, oddly enough. You know that waiter you considered aloof and cold? Go back the next night. Then the night after that. He’ll soon warm up. There are restaurants in Paris where I’m practically welcomed with open arms. Because I showed loyalty.
Paris, of course, is all about style. My wife thinks my personal style comes from England, as it leans heavily into tweed jackets or blazers, shirts with cufflinks and well-polished brogues. But the truth is that being an Englishman in Paris has accentuated that style. Paris gave me the urge to dress up — England gave me the building blocks. Plus in summer I love a stripy mariner’s T-shirt, which is totally français.
Talking of birthdays, there’s one thing I do that my wife tells me is very English. I send cards. Birthday, Christmas, Valentine’s…you name it. I take pride in selecting the prettiest ones. But they’re not so easy to find here, so I stock up when I’m in London.
Perhaps, in the end, that’s why I chose to settle in Paris. Culturally, it’s very different to the UK. But it’s also only a two and a half hours away by Eurostar. I really can have the best of both worlds.

(Originally written in January, 2021)
In Netflix’s new show Emily in Paris, a young woman moves to Paris from Chicago to work at a fashion PR firm and finds success leveraging experiential and influencer campaigns for her clients. As I binge watched the first season, I couldn’t help but notice how non-traditional marketing ideas were central to the storylines. While the show exaggerates reality a lot, it also makes a statement about marketing and advertising; experiential and influencer marketing tactics are the most effective ways for brands to authentically connect with audiences. Below are some of the most memorable examples of non-traditional marketing from the first season of Emily in Paris, along with some relevant real world examples for reference.
Interactive Installations (Episode 5)
In this episode, Emily’s boss Sylvie makes a pitch to Hästens, a Swedish luxury bed company, but the client is not impressed with her traditional marketing idea. Emily then pitches her idea for an interactive campaign showing the beds at well-known Paris locations. The client likes her idea and Emily to activates a “social media installation” at La Place Dalida, placing the bed on the street for audiences to engage with and share on their social channels. Emily’s idea is reminiscent of one of my favorite IKEA activations from back in 2013 when the brand turned billboards into real bathrooms, complete with actors brushing their teeth and styling their hair at Paris’ Saint Lazare train station. You can read about it in this article on The Drum.
Introducing Brand Rituals (Episode 8)
In this episode Emily’s friend Mindy has friends visiting from China. When they are out partying, they celebrate by spraying each other with expensive champagne. Emily is inspired and, when she has the opportunity to pitch a potential new vineyard client, suggests they create a new ritual with their surplus of champaign. Her idea is that the vineyard should create a sub brand of Champagne that is exclusively promoted for spraying and can become the “Spray of Paris.” Emily’s idea of a brand creating or endorsing a ritual around their products has proven to be effective popularized by the Ice Bucket Challenge to promote awareness for ALS. Similarly Getting Iced is a ritual created to encourage drinking Smirnoff Ice.
Guerrilla PR Stunts (Episodes 9 and 10)
In episode 9, two avante-garde fashion designers who go by the name Grey Space show up to the AFL auction to bid on a dress that Emily is modeling. They proceed to pull off a publicity stunt by shooting her with paint and shocking the audience in the middle of the show. This concept is reminiscent of Banksy’s self shredding artwork at Sotheby’s last year, and shows the strength of leveraging a live stunt to generate press and talk value.
In episode 10, Pierre returns the favor to Grey Space by creating a PR stunt of his own, hijacking the outside of his former venue and presenting his new collection directly on the street in the middle of a crowd. The audience loves it, and his disruptive stunt goes viral making him the toast of Fashion Week. Pierre’s approach in this episode is reminiscent of more immersive fashion shows that have become popular over the past few years and demonstrate how more experiential and non-traditional approaches to presenting fashion are generating buzz, creating more press and translating to sales.
As the examples above indicate, Emily works with brands to tell creative stories through stunts and real world experiences that invite participation, feel culturally authentic and generate social media shares. If Emily in Paris is any indication of how Gen Z wants to be marketed to, brands should take note and put a bigger emphasis on non traditional marketing campaigns and projects in the coming year.

If Paris is the City of Light, it’s also the city of dog poop.
Anywhere you go, on any street, in any quarter, you’ll be greeted by the familiar sight of a dog’s breakfast. Or at least what remains of it.
Make no mistake: Paris is a fecal minefield. And it always has been.
In a city known for its refinement, you could argue that the dog poop here is made to perfection — so much so that canine excrement from other cities is a distant no. 2.
Because here, every dog poop is the product of hours of French savoir-faire in the art of dégustation, digestion and excretion — a celebration of craft that brings the community together. After all, the best way to give a merde about society is by leaving one behind.
So to celebrate Parisian solidarity, I thought it would be interesting to document the sheer variety of dog poop in Paris, before these most humble of creations go the way of the dinosaurs.
It’s a truism that dogs are allowed to poop next to trees. At least then, people can avoid tarnishing their soles with a stranger’s gift. But what happens when this gift isn’t gifted in the streets’ litter…

In ways both small and large, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games is a series of firsts. It will be the first in the history of the Games to include breakdancing (or “breaking”) as a competitive event, and the first to achieve gender parity. Paris 2024 may also achieve the Games’ highest level of sustainability yet by becoming the first to halve its carbon emissions compared to the average of London 2012 and Rio 2016.
The goal has been years in the making, set in motion by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) — the Lausanne, Switzerland–based body that oversees all matters related to the Games and the Olympic Movement at large — and the IOC’s Olympic Agenda 2020, a roadmap that spells out its broader goals. Sustainability is a key pillar of that roadmap. The IOC has committed to reducing its direct and indirect emissions by 50 percent by 2030, when all Olympic Games must also commit to reducing carbon emissions and compensate for more than 100 percent of their residual emissions.
“Paris 2024 is the first edition to fully embrace this ambition of the strategic roadmap,” Marie Sallois, IOC’s director of corporate and sustainable development, told Convene. “From Day One, [Paris 2024] was conceived with sustainability in mind.” In fact, the Paris 2024 Organizing Committee — the body responsible for planning, organizing, financing, and delivering the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris in 2024 — pledged to halve carbon emissions during its bid, in step with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
That goal initiated a complete overhaul of the Games’ sustainability strategy, chiefly switching from a post-Games assessment to setting a pre-Games target and defining a carbon budget early on: less than 1.7 million tons of CO2. This carbon budget is treated much like a financial budget, where “every decision you make about an event, an activation,” Sallois said, “you must take into account how much it costs, how many people will work on it, and how much carbon it emits.”
“That’s a very different approach than the one we took in the past,” she said. Although many editions of the Games had “interesting, innovative solutions in terms of sustainability” — Sallois cited the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, which embraced circularity with recycled Olympic Medals and podiums — for Paris 2024, she said, “sustainability was first and foremost.”
Come July 26, 2024, when the opening ceremony kicks off, spectators and athletes will see this new iteration of the Games come to life, one where nearly every facet of the experience has been revised to lessen its environmental impact. “Some things are incremental, some things are drastic,” Sallois said. But overall, the strategy has been to “look at… the levers that contribute the most to the footprint.”
Of those levers, infrastructure ranks as one of the largest. Already, Paris 2024 has achieved a new benchmark in this category — 95 percent of the venues for the Games will utilize existing or temporary structures, the highest percentage of any previous Olympic Games. That includes historic sites that have been modernized — like Yves-du-Manoir Stadium, which served as the main venue for the eighth Olympiad in 1924 and will host the field hockey competitions for Paris 2024 — and temporary facilities, like an outdoor arena that will host the Olympic and Paralympic equestrian jumping and dressage competitions on the Etoile Royale esplanade at Château de Versailles.
The design of the new Aquatics Centre, the only permanent sports facility built for Paris 2024, meets stringent environmental standards. It has been built primarily with wood rather than concrete or steel, both of which create carbon dioxide in their manufacturing process, and will require less cooling and heating, aided by the rooftop solar array. The Olympic and Paralympic Village also demonstrates how infrastructure for the Games can be built using sustainable construction methods to lower emissions. Stretching into the neighborhoods of Seine-Saint-Denis, Ile Saint-Denis, and Saint-Ouen, the 126-acre site will accommodate 14,500 athletes and their staff during the Olympic Games followed by 9,000 athletes and their staff during the subsequent Paralympic Games. The Village’s carbon footprint is also 30 percent smaller than that of a modern construction project as a result of using wood and recycled materials. The latter, Sallois said, represents how the Village exemplifies “how we want to build for the future,” by not just focusing on lowering carbon emissions, but creating climate-resilient infrastructure.
Powering Paris 2024 infrastructure using renewable energy — like the geothermal-powered Olympic Village — will be a first for the Games, Sallois said, and what she thinks holds significant potential for the events industry at large. “Often in the past, the model for large events — and this is true for events other than sporting events — [is diesel] generators as a primary source of energy,” she said.
Instead, a newly created grid operated by French partner Enedis and EDF will supply Paris 2024 venues with energy produced via off-site wind and solar farms. According to the IOC, it will save 14,000 tons of carbon emissions. And it’s also permanent, helping to further the legacy of Paris 2024 by allowing future events to harness renewable energy, too — an idea that Sallois believes represents “a big shift for the industry of events.”
Solar energy generated on site also is helping to power the event. The Aquatics Centre’s photovoltaic panel-covered roof is intended to supply all of the facility’s energy needs and also will qualify as one of France’s largest urban solar farms. Similar installations will be added to the Olympic Village, the Transport Mall, and even the Seine, where a floating solar power plant with 7,750 square meters will supply energy to the Games and will be repurposed elsewhere later. Even the backup generators — essential in the event of interruptions in energy supply — will run on biofuels.
It helps that Paris is already one of the most walkable cities in the world, which is further bolstered by a robust public transportation system and the fact that many of Paris 2024’s major venues will be centrally located within the city.
“Paris, together with IOC, has completely revisited … transportation operations and the transportation plan to not only use the most efficient transportation means from a sustainability point of view, but also to reduce, in total, the [need for] transportation,” said Panos Tzivanidis, the IOC’s director of corporate events and services.
For Paris 2024, venues have been cherrypicked for their proximity to public transport — even beyond Paris. Lyon, Saint-Etienne, Nice, Bordeaux, Nantes, and Marseille will all serve as Olympic host sites in 2024, with France’s high-speed TGV rail network connecting spectators to those cities and other Olympic sites around France. Within Paris, those spectators will have the Paris metro to rely on, which has expanded routes for the Games, along with nearly 260 miles of bike lanes, including 54 miles of recently added lanes that will create new access points to competition venues. Thousands of extra bikes will be available for spectator use via Vélib, a public bike-sharing program. In addition, Toyota will provide a fleet of electric- and hydrogen-fueled transportation options on hand for athletes, staff, and spectators.
“Paris 2024 is really a turning point in our approach [to legacy] because now it’s really us adapting to the city, and no longer the [city] adapting to us,” Sallois said. That includes ensuring new infrastructure can be purposefully adapted and tailored to the needs of the host destination in the afterlife of the Games — a key goal laid out in the IOC’s Olympic Agenda 2020.
For example, the Aquatics Centre intends to benefit the residents of Seine-Saint-Denis, an area in Northeast Paris. During the Games, the Aquatics Centre will host the artistic swimming, water polo, and diving events but after it will provide a dedicated facility for the community — a huge asset considering that it’s an under-resourced area in terms of infrastructure and that six out of 10 teens in the area do not know how to swim. In addition, the Olympic Village site will provide the local community with more than 2,800 new housing units, two new schools, 14 acres of green space, and a new bridge crossing the Seine that links the Île-Saint-Denis and Saint-Denis neighborhoods, among other infrastructure.
For Paris 2024, legacy also goes beyond infrastructure. Paris 2024 “has a very clear legacy that has been already delivered prior to the Games,” Sallois said. “It means that the legacy is not something that you think about during the Games or after, you plan for it… to be delivered before the Games.” A prime example is Paris 2024’s commitment to motivating the country’s youth to exercise more. According to the National Observatory of Physical Activity (ONAPS), 37 percent of children between 6 and 10 years old and 73 percent of 11- to 17-year-olds do not get the recommended minimum of 60 minutes of daily physical activity. Paris 2024 has been successfully advocating for this cause through various initiatives, including convincing 36,250 French primary schools to add 30 minutes of movement to their daily schedule. “We are currently running a survey in one of the cities where these different measures have been introduced,” Sallois said, “and we know already that it has had an impact on the concentration, for instance, of kids at school.”
Sallois also pointed to how Paris 2024 has provided more economic opportunities to local businesses and organizations. According to the IOC, “early planning before the election of Paris 2024 as an Olympic host showed that the Games would generate activity for 181,000 jobs in a wide range of areas, including event organization, tourism, catering, and construction.” To streamline the process of applying for these opportunities, Paris 2024 created a new platform to ensure small businesses could compete with those with larger resources, Sallois said. This is part of a social charter solidified in 2018 between local trade unions and employer organizations, a first in Olympic history, to open up more opportunities and resources for job seekers and small businesses.
The result? “Ninety percent of the suppliers for Paris 2024 are French, and 75 percent of them are small- and medium-sized organizations,” Sallois said. “This is a big achievement — [especially] for the smaller businesses, because they have gained skills and a competitive advantage.”
Sallois emphasized that flexibility — the ability to adapt to the host territory — will continue to be key to future Olympic Games. Paris is “a very old city with a lot of existing infrastructure,” she said, and with L.A. 2028, “you’re again in a very large city with a lot of infrastructure and this is why they decided to go to a radical reuse approach — no new venues will be built.” The Olympic Village will use the UCLA campus, she said, “so it’s really a radical shift.”
One difference between L.A. and Paris is that travel by car is heavily favored in L.A, but Sallois is undeterred. “Still, we can innovate,” she said. For example, buses can be low-carbon buses. “We will find solutions, we just need to work with the constraints we have in a certain geography,” she said, but that often just means “we will innovate even more. I mean, because the Games take place every four years, by the time we reach Los Angeles, there will be new solutions on the market.”
Using Paris 2024 as a test pilot, the IOC and other entities worked with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to develop a new methodology for evaluating the social, economic, and environmental benefits of events. Guidelines based on this new methodology were released by the OECD in late 2023 for organizers to use for their own events, which can be downloaded in two parts: How to Measure Impact and Impact Indicators. Paris 2024 also has inspired another new set of guidelines — an updated ISO standard for managing the social, economic, and environmental impact of events, set to be released just prior to Paris 2024’s kickoff.
For London 2012, “we released for the first time ISO 20121, and now with Paris we are aiming at releasing the new version that will [reach] another level,” IOC’s Marie Sallois said, adding that the updated standard will put a greater emphasis on human rights, social justice, and legacy. The IOC’s Panos Tzivanidis said that the certification is “an important milestone” for not just Paris 2024, but for the IOC’s institutional events at large. “It ensures that every event we touch is aligned with our vision for a greener and more sustainable future.”
“An evaluation of the sustainability of the Olympic Games,” a study published in the April 2021 issue of online monthly journal Nature Sustainability, ranks Olympic Games — specifically those held between 1992 and 2020 — as only marginally sustainable. The study’s authors collectively rank the Games as “medium” — 48 out of 100 possible points on the scale devised for the study.
Broadly, the study states that it defines a “sustainable Olympic Games” as having three dimensions: “having a limited ecological and material footprint, enhancing social justice, and demonstrating economic efficiency.” According to the study, the Games could improve its marks by drastically reducing the size of the event, rotating the event between the same cities to reduce waste from building new infrastructure, and create an independent body to develop and enforce new sustainability standards. However, such actions come with obstacles, including a significant reduction in revenue from downsizing.
But the potential to make a positive impact — beyond the Games themselves — is huge. As the Nature Sustainability study points out, “together with their exceptional visibility, the Olympic Games provide a unique platform to reach a global audience and could serve as a model for cities, countries, and other events around the world to emulate.”

Paris, the City of Lights, is renowned worldwide for its rich culture and sophistication. It is famous for its world-class art museums like the Louvre and the Musée d’Orsay, iconic Hausmannian architecture, and manicured gardens like the Jardin des Tuileries and the Jardin du Luxembourg. Fashion, gastronomy, and fine wines are celebrated features of Parisian life.
Paris has also been a hub for major artistic and philosophical movements throughout history. Impressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism found fertile ground here, while the Age of Enlightenment and modern philosophy flourished amidst the city’s intellectual vibrancy. There is a lot to see and do in Paris, and it is one of the most visited cities in the world.
I was ecstatic when my family relocated to Paris in the summer of 2022. The City of Lights has long captivated my imagination, and moving there was a dream come true for me and my husband in many ways. We settled in our new neighborhood, with the Eiffel Tower, affectionately known as The Iron Lady — -standing nearby. We delighted in the perfectly cooked baguettes, delectable cheese, and flaky viennoiseries and tried the traiteurs and restaurants nearby. My daughter loved discovering all the whimsical carousels scattered throughout the city. We walked along the Seine at night, significantly cooling during the warm summer nights. I visited multiple exhibits and discovered artists I had never known. The city’s offering of Classical music concerts allowed me to deepen my appreciation for Bach and Vivaldi, among many others.
Living in Paris has refined my senses. I now have an eye for Western art, an ear for classical music, a refined palate, and a newfound appreciation for architectural grandeur. I have always loved nature and did not think a condensed city would be as magnificent as it would be. But I was wrong. Paris breathed beauty, and I inhaled its beauty.
Beyond its renowned culture and sophistication, Paris unexpectedly unveiled a mystical dimension. It was mystical in that when I visited certain places (other places I will discuss in later blogs), I felt a stronger connection to the Divine, the universe, or, as some would say, God. I was filled with the same awe that had gripped me while walking amongst the Redwoods in California, exploring Sedona’s red canyons, and watching the sunset on a Hawaiian beach.
This mystical energy became clearer as I uncovered the history of Paris. Around the 3rd century BC, the Parisii, a Celtic sub-tribe of the Senones, settled along the Seine River. The Parisii were one of the many Celtic tribes that made up the larger population of Gauls. The Gauls inhabited much of western Europe during the Iron Age and the Roman Age (5th century BC to 5th century AD), including modern-day France, Belgium, Switzerland, parts of Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic. They did not have a unified government or leadership but were composed of many tribes who could unite for large-scale military operations. They were known for their warrior culture and artistic achievements, such as metalwork, jewelry, and pottery. They built bridges and a fort, minted coins, and traded with other European riverine settlements.
The Gauls believed in many Gods and Goddesses. Their religion was deeply connected to nature, with spirits believed to inhabit forests, rivers, and other natural features. Druids, highly educated individuals with extensive knowledge of religion, law, medicine, astronomy, and other subjects, acted as religious leaders, teachers, and advisors in their community.
Based on etymological interpretations, Druids translates to the “oak-knower” or “knowing the oak tree.” Little is known about what the Druids were really like, and the recorded history written about them is from Roman accounts, which may not always be entirely accurate or objective. Some scholars believe women may have also played important roles within Druidic traditions, possibly as priestesses, healers, or teachers. Julius Caesar provides the most well-known Roman account of the Druids in his book “Commentarii de Bello Gallico (“Commentaries on the Gallic War”).
Here is what was included in his description:
However, the Roman conquest of Gaul, which included the area of Paris, and the arrival of Christianity led to the suppression of Druidic practices. In 52 BC, the Romans conquered the Parisii and established the Gallo-Roman town of Lutetia on the central island of Paris, where the Parisii settled. Christianity took root in Lutetia during the 3rd century AD.
After the fall of the Roman Empire, Clovis I, the King of the Franks, seized control of the city and designated it as the capital of his kingdom. This began Paris’ importance as a European political and cultural center.
Fast forward to the modern day, I was surprised to see Paris’ Celtic history represented at the Opening Ceremony for the 2024 Summer Olympics. As part of the program, a mechanical metallic horse carrying the Olympic flag galloped through the Seine with a rider wearing a metal suit. It was captivating and left a lasting impression on me. I wanted to learn about the symbolism, and I discovered that the horse and the rider symbolized not only the Olympic spirit of resilience, peace, solidarity, and unity but also the goddess Sequana, a revered deity in Gallic mythology.
Information about the Goddess Sequana is derived from excavations performed at her sanctuary located at the principal source of the Seine River called the Fontes Sequanae, near Châtillon-sur-Seine in the Burgundy region of France. In the mid-18th century, archaeologists discovered the foundations of a massive rectangular building (57 meters by 18 meters) within a valley near the source of the Seine River, with an inscription that read “DEA SEQUANA,” identifying the site as a sanctuary dedicated to the goddess Sequana. In 1933, renowned artist Henri Corot made a significant discovery: the bronze statue of the goddess Seine was found near a faun statue.
Archaeological excavations in 1863–1967 confirmed that this was once a pilgrimage site for devotees. Excavations yielded an impressive collection of roughly 1,500 votive offerings crafted from stone, bronze, and wood. The offerings contained specific body parts — eyes, limbs, sexual organs, and even internal organs — suggesting that the pilgrims must have sought the goddess’s divine intervention to heal ailments represented by the body parts. Sculptures often depicted pilgrims presenting gifts to the goddess, such as money, fruit, or their cherished pets — dogs and birds. Despite her Celtic origins, Sequana was eventually adopted into the broader framework of Gallo-Roman religious worship.
The Seine, a 485-mile (780-kilometer) river, flows northwest through the heart of Paris and empties into the English Channel at the Normandy coast. Lined with charming cafes and iconic landmarks, it is one of Paris’ major tourist attractions.
I love going for walks along the Seine. Sometimes, I find a bench or place along the quai and sit there awhile. I stare at its beauty as the sun dances on its surface, and in the evenings, I bask in its glory as the illuminated lights of the city shimmer and sparkle like stars in its waters. Then the world slows down, and the city’s frenetic pace fades into a distant hum as I go within to a place of stillness. I feel a sense of awe, a divine feminine energy surrounding me. Sequana, with her effortless grace, invites me to pause and simply be. She reminds me that amidst the chaos of city life, there is always a place for peace and serenity where my soul can find solace.
Living in Paris, I am slowly recreating the myth that connecting to the Divine in a big, condensed city is difficult. By uncovering Paris’ history and connecting to the beautiful myths of the people who once lived here, I, too, sense the magic they felt by the Seine River, the splendor of the Goddess Sequana.
Where do you live? Do you know your city’s history and myths? Do you have a place where you could be with yourself and simply BE?

Helping You Adapt to Life in France

In case you missed Part 1, I’m sharing my unique journey from I’ll-never-live-abroad to nearly-10-years-in-France-and-counting.
I’m often asked how I did it — and while several of my articles on TAIP touch on how I’ve been able to stay, I wanted to write it all out in a way that could be copied by anyone reading. Okay, maybe not anyone. It took a lot of hard work to build my life here in France, and it isn’t over yet. I’ll be starting my journey to citizenship next, which promises to be full of paperwork and even more determination.
But, I’m getting ahead of myself. Below I’m picking up where I left off on Part 2: I was an au pair, didn’t want to continue on as an au pair, but didn’t want to go back to the US just yet. Here’s how I figured out a way to stay.
I was always one of those people who said, “Never again!” after finishing my undergrad. It wasn’t that I didn’t like school — on the contrary, I’ve always enjoyed learning — but I was sick of papers and tests and all of the other coursework that went along with it.
Famous last words. As I finished up my second year as an au pair, I didn’t have many options other than the easy-to-obtain student visa. I decided I wanted to get my master’s degree. Public education is cheap here and I knew I’d regret it if I didn’t. This time, however, I was going to study something I was actually interested in, not something that would lead to a job one day.
I settled on French Literature. I’ve always loved reading and writing and I figured I might as well study the greats while I was in the city where many of them worked and lived. The only wrench in my plan? I still, after 2.5 years, could not speak or read French. In my defense, I came over here only knowing the basics, and as an American au pair, I was required to speak English with the children I took care of. At this point, I knew could understand about 75% of what was said to me, but I couldn’t speak back. It was a combination of a lack of vocabulary and confidence.
What’s more, I knew I wanted to go to a public school (again, cheap), and to do so as a foreigner I had to have a certain level of French, with a certificate to prove it. So, I looked around for some programs that would meet the student visa requirement of 20 hours per week. I found two: one at the famous La Sorbonne and one at the also famous Université Nanterre. I missed the deadline for La Sorbonne so that left me with Nanterre.
I applied, got in, looked for housing (and found the deal of a lifetime: I traded 10 hours of English lessons per week for a 9m2 sardine box in the sky), went back to America for a few weeks, got my student visa, and returned to home to Paris. Back to school, I went.
And so began my year-long journey to learning French. I loved my program — and recommend it to anyone who wants to live here long-term — I was the only Anglophone and so the only common language my classmates and I had was (broken) French. Our teachers also insisted that we speak in French instead of our native language. It was difficult, but it also felt like the best place to do it. Everyone had an accent, and everyone was trying to learn.
I met some very kind people, finally learned French, and also discovered more about French culture. We went on field trips in Paris and the Île-de-France region and ultimately all became quite close. Spending 20+ hours per week together will do that.
With my B2 certificate in hand, I was finally ready to apply for my master’s. I still wanted to study French Literature, and so started to look at those kinds of programs. I had a couple of informational interviews at various universities in town, before sitting down with one guidance counselor in particular.
She looked over my resume and experiences and asked why I didn’t want to study English Literature instead of French. At this point, I had started dabbling in freelance writing and had indicated that on my CV, and well…the whole “native English speaker” thing. I told her it felt silly to come all the way to France only to study English. Mais non! she assured me, and encouraged me to look into English Literature programs instead.
The meeting piqued my interest, and soon the curse of the missed deadline struck again — but it was for the best. Nanterre University, where I completed my French course, had a bilingual English Literature master’s program. Because I was already in their system, it was very easy to apply. I was accepted almost immediately (again, native English speaker), paid my tuition (400 € for the year), and began.
I loved my teachers, loved my program, and bonded with my peers. No, I never wanted to go back to school, but completing my master’s at a French public university was one of the best experiences I’ve ever had. I’ll never regret it.
After my two-year program, spoiler alert, I still wasn’t ready to go home. I met my now-husband about halfway through year one and things had gotten very serious very quickly, in true French dating fashion. We were making serious plans for the future. But…what about my visa?
I obtained the APS visa, which gives you a year to look for work after you graduate from a French institution. I did look for a job but I knew I wanted to work in English (even to this day I can’t write in French beyond simply texting), and finding a job that aligned with that was difficult. I had no issue finding Anglophone clients, but there wasn’t a need for full-time English writers in Paris — or at least, the jobs that I found didn’t pay very well.
The APS visa was quickly running out, so what’s a girl in a relationship with a French person to do? The marriage conversation happens. I’m lucky that I was with someone who I knew I wanted to spend my life with, visa issue or not. So, we made plans to quickly marry at the town hall so that I could obtain the vie privée et familiale visa.
Long story short, I did get that visa and so my future in France was secured for life. I’m not saying that everyone needs to meet a French person and marry them in order to stay here (indeed, there’s an entire shady trade in this which we may write about in the future) — there are a lot of other options out there including the profession libérale visa, or even a long-stay visitor visa if citizenship isn’t important — but in my unique situation, my husband is the reason I was allowed to stay.
That’s the gist of it — a couple thousand words on my journey to France. I hope it will serve as inspiration for anyone else who may find themselves thinking, but wait, I don’t want to leave too.

Fans of the film Casablanca know that when Rick comforts Lisa he means people will always have memories of people and places and moments in time.
The thing is, Paris — partly thanks to such films as Casablanca, Midnight in Paris, and Forget Paris (and many others) — revels in its reputation as the City of Light, the City of Love, a city rich in history and literature.
Much of that reputation lies in layers of myth, as many visitors soon learn the minute they step into the Arrivals section at Charles De Gaulle (CDG) airport.
Paris is a big, noisy, and bustling city. No two ways about it.
Rose-colored glasses soon fall to the pavement. And tourists fall victim to “Paris Syndrome,” seeming similar to Stendahl Syndrome, a condition that visitors to Florence suffer from too much beauty. Yet there’s a difference, yes?
Regardless, I love Paris, with all its warts and issues.
Believe me, warts exist. Note that I have visited Paris at least twelve times, for varying lengths of time.
But it’s understandable how so many of the millions of yearly travelers fail to find the Paris of their dreams.
Take my most recent trip, in March/April 2023.
During the first week, I wound up dodging garbage piled HIGH, almost to American first-floor height.
Tourists crowded every nook and cranny near the city center, so much so I didn’t get inside my favorite bookstore at all: Shakespeare & Co.
Fortunately, I stayed in the relatively tourist-free 15th arrondissement, about four blocks from the Seine, south of the Eiffel Tower and Champs de Mars.
I also got a good taste of what the city is truly like near the Buttes Chaumont.
And, of course, driving from CDG to the center, you can’t miss the concrete block apartment buildings and the banlieues on the way into the city, including Drancy, of ill fame during WWII.
Speaking of the Champs de Mars brought back a memory, one that should have shredded any desire of mine to visit Paris ever again.
It’s one of my most memorable Parisian memories.
Early on a June morning, I left my closet-sized hotel room on the Avenue Emile Deschanel and started toward the Champs de Mars on my way to a two-week cooking class at the Cordon Bleu at its former Rue Léon Delhomme location, “Fish and Their Sauces.” Since it was June, and warm, it only felt right to wear sandals. I’d change into sturdier shoes once I opened my locker at the school. The chefs didn’t allow sandals in the kitchens. And with good reason, given the heavy pots and boiling liquids so easily dropped or spilled.
As usual, I focused my eyes on the architecture looming above me. Rounding a corner near the far end of the park, my right foot forward, I stepped into a steaming pile of fresh dog poop. Creamy, warm, and stinky.
As the feces — likely from one of the pampered poodles of ladies living in the Faubourg Saint Germain area — seeped between each of my five toes, I frantically searched through my purse for some Kleenex. I leaned up against a wall and scraped as much of the goop off as I could.
As I flew through the door at the Cordon Bleu, I barked a terse, de rigueur “Bon jour” to the receptionist and hurried downstairs to the locker room. I ripped off the sandal and thrust my filthy foot into one of the sinks, pumping the soap dispenser like a farmer milking a cow.
With a half dozen paper towels, I managed to dry my foot enough to pull on a sock and the required leather shoe suitable for the kitchen. The left foot, no problem.
As for my sandals, I would never be able to get the subtle stink of dog poop out of the leather straps. I wrapped both sandals in a plastic bag and shoved them into the trash bin. Then I finished dressing in the required uniform, necessary even for short-term students.
I bought another pair of shoes from a street vendor in Montmartre a few days later. However, I never wore sandals again in Paris during any of my many future visits to the city.
Despite efforts to eliminate the French dog poop problem, it persists.
What to do?
Don’t look up before you look down first!

In these times, when supply far exceeds demand, and everyone is creating for the sake of sharing and appreciation, it’s crucial to take a step back, close your eyes, and find new perspectives. Otherwise, you might just end up bored and disinterested, since what you’re doing has probably been done before.
The unpredictable nature of street photography can be liberating, but it can also present a fog of opportunities without clear direction. You wake up in the morning, not knowing what you’ll bring home, which is fine and wonderful. However, there are occasions when having clear guidelines helps, especially when you are in a not-so-familiar place but want to make the most of it.
Living in the Netherlands, reaching the “City of Light” takes about a five-hour drive in an electric car. I’ve visited Paris several times, but this year I combined a weekend of tourism with my passion for street photography. With limited time for both, I needed to be objective.
The solution? To participate in a photography competition with a triptych mindset.

Last year, I was in the mood to read the classics, so I picked up “A Moveable Feast” by Ernest Hemingway:
“A Moveable Feast” is a memoir and a sketchbook of the time when a young and poor Hemingway lived in Paris during the 1920s.
He was a foreign correspondent at the time, and his literary career was just beginning. I hadn’t read anything by Hemingway in many years, and picking up this book reminded me how much I like his writing style.
“A Moveable Feast” is a bit random, as you might expect from a diary-style narration.
Hemingway writes about his relationship with his first wife and the woman he cheated on her with, who later became his second wife (spoiler alert — he had four wives in total).
He also writes about his friendships within the American expat community in the 1920s Paris, including his relationship with Scott Fitzgerald and other writers and artists of that time (spoiler alert — Fitzgerald was an alcoholic).
The book has many interesting moments. For example, Hemingway writes about being poor and constantly hungry in Paris, which was especially hard with all the bakeries and restaurants on the Parisian streets. Apparently, this is why his novels and literary works have a bigger focus on food and drinks.
“A Moveable Feast” is, if I’m not mistaken, the author’s last published work. It’s definitely a good read, full of stories about Paris and getting drunk with famous artists.
Beer of the day is an easy choice — my favorite Blue Moon!
I do repeat this beer quite a lot here, but it always features different surroundings.
This picture is special as it was taken at one of the stalls during the 2024 Edinburgh Fringe festival.
It was our first time experiencing Fringe, and oh me oh my, what an experience! It was truly amazing, and felt like a month-long carnival. I definitely had a post-Fringe blues afterwards.

People will argue with me on this. For many, the race last weekend: Ronde van vlaanderen aka Tour of Flanders is the best race of the season. And indeed, in terms of spectator experience and in terms of cobbled climbs, which separate the gladiators from the men, climbs like the Paterberg, the bone shaking and long Kwaremont and the Koppenberg, it is indeed a great race to watch. Last weekend, it was the legendary Tadej Pogacar dropping his equally legendary rival, Matthieu Van Der Poel on the Kwaremont on their 3rd turn up the hill, to take his 2nd Tour of Flanders win.
But for me, the race that has always fascinated me, has had this weird combination of mystique and fear, has always left me romanticising about cycling is none other than the race I am watching while writing this blog: Paris-Roubaix, often known as the hell of the north.
A bit of cycling context, the most famous race on the cycling calendar is the Tour de France, which is a 3 week long stage race capturing the imagination of everyone who has ever ridden a bike. The stages spanning through beautiful French countrysides, ending in sprints, the battles on the slopes of the Pyrenees and the Alps, it is hard not be romantic about cycling. It evokes the primitive of emotions. It is poetry in motion. There are two other grand tours: Giro D’Italia and Vuelta d’Espana, both of whom hold less prestige than the Tour De France. These are the 3, 3 week stage races. There multiple 2 and 1 week stage races as well and then there are some famous one day races. Out of them, one of the key races has always been the Road World Championships which often happens at the end of the Vuelta, toward September. And then you have the 5 Classics:
If you were wondering if there are any other cyclists other than Pogacar and Van Der Poel, you can be excused. Out of the last 19 Classics, 14 have been won by these two. I am writing this part with 52.5 kilometers to go in today’s race and Pogacar, Van Der Poel and Jasper Philipsen (Winner of 2024 Milan San-Remo and Van Der Poel’s teammate) lead the race by 1'18"".
Simple reason: The drama. Take a look at this picture:
And this:
The start point of Paris-Roubaix is variable, for example, in 2025 it began in Compiègne (Which is a bit outside Paris). But it always end up in the Velodrome of Roubaix, where the riders do 750 meters and often end up in a sprint finish. In 2025, the distance of the race was 259.2 kilometers and it is often in that range and during these kilometers, the riders go through several cobbled sections.
These sections are hundreds of years old and are maintained by “Les amis des Paris-Roubaix”. This group of volunteers, founded by Jean-Claude Vallaeys in 1983 maintain the cobbled sections in their pristine state so that the racers have the same conditions of the cobbles every year. The cobbles, as I mentioned before are the main point of attraction of this race. The sections are graded with stars, with the 1 star sections being the “easiest” and the 5 star sections being the most challenging. There are 3, 5-star cobble sections and the race has 27 cobbled sections in total. The grading is based on the quality of the cobbles and the distance on them.
The most iconic section of the cobbles, pictured above is the Trouée d’Arenberg aka Arenberg Forest. It is 2400 meter section of cobbles, laid down at the time of Napoleon 1. The intensity of these cobbles is mind boggling especially coupled with the fact that the entry to the cobbles was on a downhill section, causing the riders to enter the section at a speed of 60 kmph. (A highly criticised chicane was added in 2024 to reduce the speed of entry). Even so, the Arenberg forest, about 100 kilometers from the finish is the place where the first selection is made from the group of favourites. There are 2 more sectors of the 5 star variety: the 3 km long Mons-en-Pévèle which has 2 right hand turns while climbing steadily and the decisive Carrefour de l’Arbre, which arrives 15 kilometers before the finish line. The 2.1 kilometer section is brutal, winding and with its proximity to the finish is often where the riders make the final attack.
As you can imagine, the race gets intense as the riders jostle with each other to get the best line over the cobbles, the bike shakes and you see bottles and parts fall out. These sections are narrow and if you get a flat, it is in your benefit that you’re in the front and can get a wheel change. If not, you get stuck behind and can lose a lot of time. In the words of a former 2nd place finisher and one of the icons of Paris-Roubaix, George Hincapie: “This is a war, you give them an inch, they will take a mile.” This race gets even more brutal when it rains. In the dry, the riders just inhale the dust of the cobbled sections. In the rain, they get covered in it.
If the selection hasn’t been made in the cobbles and there are still more than 1 riders in contention, the decisive move comes inside the iconic Roubaix Velodrome.
For all the twists and the Machiavellian turns, Paris Roubaix remains the best race in the spring classics for me.
In the words of the most winningest rider of the Paris-Roubaix, Tom Boonen:
The 2025 race was the surprising debut of Tadej Pogacar, who at 65 kilograms is much lighter than most of his rivals, including the pre-race favourite and 2-time defending champion, Matthieu Van Der Poel. Van Der Poel also was aiming to become the 1st man since Francesco Moser (1978, 1979, 1980) to win Paris Roubaix back-to-back, 3 times in a row.
The first selection in the race was made, as expected in the Arenberg forest with a bunch of the pre-race favourites including Wout Van Aert, Mads Pedersen, Pogacar’s teammate’s Nils Politt and Florian Vermeersch, and Van De Poel’s teammate, former 2nd place finisher Jasper Philipsen. Pogacar and Van Der Poel kept launching attacks from 100 kilometers out and it became a real war of attrition. Pogacar, who had already crashed earlier in the day, was almost got taken out by his team car.
With 55 kilometers to go, Pogacar launched an attack which left only Van Der Poel and Philipsen in his wake. As the race proceeded, another attack by Pogacar dropped Philipsen. With 30 kilometers to go, Pogacar took a strong right hand turn but didn’t slow down enough which caused him to crash into the barriers. Van Der Poel maintained a 20"" gap from Pogacar until Pogacar dropped off his bike and took a new bike with 20k to go. The gap grew to over a minute, but in the Carrefour de l’Arbre, it was Van Der Poel’s turn to change bikes. The change came quickly and though he nearly crashed into a barrier, Van Der Poel was never in doubt as he rounded up the Velodrome to take his 3rd Paris Roubaix win. Pogacar finished smiling, content with his 2nd place on his 1st showing here. Behind him, in a sprint Pedersen took the last podium spot, followed by Van Aert and then Vermeersch.
Thank you for reading!

Henry Miller is one dirty cunt. I’ve never read Marquis de Sade but I imagined that Miller to be a modern day Sade, blending all the taboos he can think about (and I can think about) into one novel. Miller is no stranger to being a banned author. Tropic of Cancer was banned in the author’s country of birth until 1961, almost thirty years after it made headways in Paris via the famous publisher Obelisk Press in 1934, where modern day Shakespeare and Co. Bookshop is now.
This is the reason I bought the book in the first place, on an obligatory purchase and visit to the well-renowned bookshop. It took me at least a couple of hours to decide which book to buy from the place. In all honesty, much of the book available on the shelves of Shakespeare and Co. are available in other bookshops and for cheaper. But I’m a bit pretentious at the best of times, so I needed to pick out a book. Henry Miller, who created a career in Paris and owed the city his success was a logical choice. I have not read Miller’s erotica, so why not eh.
When Miller wrote Under the Roofs of Paris (formerly known as Opus Pistorum), he was broke, hungry and would write a dollar a page for this kind of smut. Paris was known for its erotica back in the early twentieth century, its explicit postcards (which also feature prominently in the book) and smut writing was of no place to the conservative American mind at the time. But this sexual liberation was perhaps representative of Paris at the epoch, and it took an American to crystalise that epitome of recklessness.
In the introduction to Delta of Venus, Anaïs Nin spoke about Miller’s venture in writing erotica, that the collector wanted more, that the writers started to exhaust their personal stories and had to look elsewheres. I wonder if Milton Luboviski who commissioned Henry Miller for this was the same collector which demanded Miller to write with less poetry in his smut.
Perhaps not. Because I don’t find much poetry in the book. What we read is explicit sex, sometimes performed by individuals who shouldn’t be having sex. Some of the age is explicit, and the protagonist, Alf, had also indulged in engaging with these minors. I do feel sick at the thought of it and it makes me wonder whether Henry Miller had the same experiences. It would certainly adjust my respect for him as a person.
In the book, our protagonist Alf took part in bukkake-like orgies, a threesome with a midget (which also involves a German shepherd with a generous phallus which I guess makes it a foursome), threesomes with Lesbians, shooting porn, and let’s not talk about his involvement with underaged girls. All these leisurely activities are implemented in an extensive possible combinations of holes, body parts and bodily fluids. This list obviously, is far from exhaustive. Miller writes from experience, and whether some of these had happened to him or his acquaintances, I don’t really know nor do I really want to care.
Yes, I can find traces of Tropic of Cancer here with its crude and detailed description of sex, which makes me doubt if I am adventurous myself in that way. Alf’s organ, John Thursday, is akin to another character that literally always rear its ugly head at the worst (or best) of times. It’s like Alf has a constant walking erection. Alf and John Jeudi seem like different characters, but forever interlinked to one another and dependent on each other’s existence. Come to think of it, all men and their wangs are like that.
After the first hundred pages, the book loses its novelty, which also made me wonder if I had grown up too much to read Henry Miller. In Malay terms, we can say it’s “jelak” which means feeling eugh after having too much of something, usually after you’re halfway through that bowl of Peter’s pork noodles and you regretted getting a large portion instead of small. But comparing Miller’s writing to a bowl of hawker pork noodles is probably not the best idea.
In fact, if I can compare the reading experience with another book, it’d be Bret Easton Ellis’ American Psycho, where the violence felt too much after a while, too caricaturish, far an adaptation of what we know violence to be. The sex in Under the Roofs of Paris is of a similar nature. Never once do I feel the reality of it, however visceral or extreme the nature of it might be.
Now for the million dollar question: as an erotica, did it turn me on? Based on what I mentioned above, no. But there are bits of it that made me raise my eyebrows, and more often than not, bits of it where I’m just shaking my head and saying yeah nah in my head, impatient for the next scene to unravel. I’ve read the book in my commute home in trains and over coffee, but thankful and hopeful that nobody is peering over my shoulder and basking over the gratuitous language.
On a side note, there was also the matter of Billie and Jean, the former more of a lesbian than the latter. Did Michael Jackson steal his most famous song from the characters of Miller’s work? No matter, if it was coincidental, then more power to Henry Miller. Another vignette: the book’s original title, Opus Pistorum literally translates to the work of the miller. Clever cunt, that Henry guy.

On another P.S.S. read this stupendous essay on Henry Miller by Victoria Best, if you really want to dig deep into Henry Miller’s life and his past traumas.

I shouldn’t be getting into the habit of enjoying Easter holidays (or any holidays, Christian ones especially) and annual leave just in case I didn’t make it to extend my work visa, but truth be told? I do enjoy holidays as a normal person does and should.
For Easter this year, I went to Paris. When I received the job offer last September, I thought it would be proper that I started visiting some other great museums of ethnology or anthropology, so I could learn for my work. A great example is indeed, the Quai-Branly Museum in Paris, which I had heard several times when I was at school. This museum was definitely on my list of must-visit.
It wouldn’t be my first time to Paris as I went there almost a decade (2015) ago, during which I embarked on a less-than-72-hour marathon of “ticking the tourist’s boxes”: I was in Paris waiting for a flight back to Brno. As a poor student in one of the most expensive cities in the world, I tried to minimse my stay while trying to see EVERYTHING: Louvre? Tick. Château de Versailles? Tick. Champ Élysées? Tick. Eiffel Tower plus climbing it? Double tick.
I was not sure if this time would be better than a marathon, but I was aiming for a rather different route, i.e. another busman’s holiday of museums and histories. Yet, as the title suggest, unfortunately I was sick the whole time. To be specific, the moment I stepped off the Eurostar at Gare du Nord, I immediately realised my Easter holiday was going to be a bit of tumbling along the way.
There are two categories for my visits in Paris: the traditional way and the interactive way. Although the numbers of places in each category seem uneven, I want to bring out the distinction between this post and the next.
I definitely had to put this museum as №1 on my list, as I’m trying to be more prepared for my job at the MAA. I was also guranteed by many colleagues that I “wouldn’t regret”, “a must-see”, and they all left highly possitive comments for this particular museum. I therefore had really high hopes.
I arrived at the museum (with a low fever that was ready to rage in the following four hours) after I visited the Sainte-Chapelle in the morning. The entrance was rather empty, with a ramp that led to the main gallery. There was a large cylindircal space built with glass in the middle of the foyer, which ran through the floors and reached the basement, and through the dark frosty glass, it seemed to be a display gallery as well. (I will come back to this cool space)
Marching along the ramp, there was light and image of water ripples cast by an over-head projector, in hindsight reminding me the ramp of ocean tides that I once walked on in National Museum of Natural Science, Taiwan.
1.1 Oceania
I found myself standing in a tall and wide space, facing towards two galleries: On my right side was Pacific and Oceania; on my left was America. Immediately I was distracted by the large objects near me, which were displayed in a way familiar to me. Many photos of MAA taken by the visitors, no matter how randomly, often feature the large totem pole (1922.265), the slit gong, or the grizzly bear. It doesn’t mean that other collections are unimportant to them, neither does it mean that they learn a lot from these three display, but that they are large enough to be representative of a nice day-out on their photo albums. I am clearly biased for that I see MAA from a behind-the-scene, research-based perspective, and also I know a lot more collections that can be iconic. If I have to choose collections that represent MAA, I probably wouldn’t choose the above three. To me, the first impression of Quai-Branly, also the most impressive collections, could be these large wooden sculptured objects (masks, boards, ceremonial tools), but it may be completely different from what the staff members’ point of view.
Almost as a premonition, I stumbled across these two “boards” in a glass case. I didn’t know that later in April, after I came back from Paris, I would be seeing a large number of Gope boards with a researcher from West Australia. However, looking back the photos I took, I could see that both Quai-Branly and MAA shared a lot of common interest in terms of collecting policy, or put in another way, both museums were formed by early anthropologists who had a close network, who naturally formed the trendy studies of exploring the “unknown pacific islands” then.
I can recognise the very similar motifs of the face mask on the left side: heart-shape nostril, mushroom-shape dome above the head, and two dots, possibly pierced rings for decoration. All are present on the Gope boards I handled in mid-April. However, there are also a lot of features that I didn’t see on this face mask: The chevrons on relief, and the vibrant red, white, and black pigment commonly used. This object is also featured on Google Arts and Culture.
artsandculture.google.com
!! NOTICE !!
Readers discretion: Please notice that there will be images of HUMAN REMAINS (skulls) below.
Many objects on display reminded me similar collections that I once saw and handled in MAA. Strangely, through this exploration I started appreciating more my work and the reason why anthropology matters: The physical material being preserved acts not only a reminder of the culture that exists (or existed), but also as an evidence that shows that culture constantly evolves, and that artistic choices change all the time. Take the chest ornament above for example. The feathers being a crucial part in Asmat art were incorporated in a contemporary artistic creation. The handbag in MAA inherits the traditional material and presents a new usage, becoming a new tradition for the anthropologists in the next century.
It was at this point when the fever kicked in. I started feeling a cold chill spreading from my lower back, but my face felt so warm and my throat was coarse. I thought, however, that I was simply dehydrated, which was why I persevered.
Remember the huge cylindrical space mentioned before? I reached the end of the Oceania zone and met it again. Seeing through the glass, I saw shelves and storage units stacked neatly, with musical instruments arranged among them. Originally I thought it was a behind-the-scene display, allowing the public to see what a music storage house would look like. The tags on objects made sense. However, I was wrong, at least not entirely wrong. It was an exhibition “Storage of the unspoken” (La reserve de non-dits) by Youmna Saba, who explored the “sonic behaviour” of the ethnographic musical instruments. In the English booklet, I shared the same frustration as the artist explained,
[…] a great enthusiasm, then a lack of breath, before frustration set in. What can an instrument express in a dark glass tower the public only passes by?
The irony of preserving anthropological objects is that the method to extend the life span is exact the same to stifle the purpose of its life. There comes the philosophical question that many face: What use of x, if it can not perform the function when it was created? Does it still count an x? If not, are we simply doing the formality?
www.quaibranly.fr
The paradox is especially apparent on musical instruments, as they should be appreciated with hearing instead of looking. At the MAA, whenever there’s a community person visiting to see their own heritage collections, our policy is that they could choose to handle them with bare hands (without gloves), and it is amazing to see how, for example, musical instruments, sound when they are played. It is very tricky when it comes to wind instruments such as flutes, pipes, and horns, as we are not never sure if they were in contact with historical pesticide, which can make visitors sick. Nevertheless, the spirit is that the museum should be a place where people make the material legacies alive. I would love to know if this large display allowed people to physically handle the collections (it seemed close when I visited). If yes, how would the experience proceed?
At this point, you should find out that I had reached another section, Asia. Seeing the Paiwan ancestor board was really a nice heads-up. Another thing was that my fever was getting worse and I felt even more dehydrated.
!! Notice!!
There might be human remains (ashes) in the collections in the next photo. Readers discretion.
I was thrilled to learn more about shadow puppets from the audio guide. Apparently the fantastic performanceship originated in India, rather than China, which I was told as a kid. The story and the characters indeed changed and evolved as the style migrated and spread among different Asian regions. My first experience with shadow puppets was sorting them from the Skeat collection, which were less elaborate but all the same, impressive (See Z 33667 and Z 33587). I also admire how the Quai-Branly used light box to display the puppets, bringing the colours and crafting details to the eyes.
One can tell that I sped up my visiting pace as I didn’t take that many photos in Asia section.
The monologue I had upon seeing the Benin Bronzes was probably the same when visitors came to the MAA and saw exactly the same display. I have tried to explain to friends that museums simply couldn’t “pack them and ship them back to Nigeria”. If only it were that easy! Shame it’s not wrapping and mailing Christmas gift for Auntie Gladys. The most difficult part is never the practicality of packing and courriering, but the politics and funding that are involved in the repatriation process. Nevertheless, museums are not at liberty to share the details, which are the gap between them and the public.
I was really speeding up my visit without skipping too many collections on display, because my fever was getting a bit out of control. At one point I just felt I couldn’t get up and all I wanted was gulping water. There were at least two school groups at the same time so I used that as an excuse to proceed faster. The royal statue was the last before I moved on to the last section — America.
If I were to commit to a specific area of expertise, the First Nationas people in North America would probably be my second choice, other than East Asia. I know very little about them, but from what I was told and saw, I can relate the history of driving the indigenous people to extinction and how their land and language were taken away.
With a curator like Anita, a lot of research visits at MAA focused on American culture. I am not a stranger to many above. I was especially surprised to see the cape as I was 100% sure there was an identical copy of it in our own gallery, and I also saw the same design on a flyer for the MA Anthropology at Sainsbury’s Centre, UEA. I asked Rachel about it, and she told me that it was a popular design, and that was why it was widely used in woven textiles as gifts.
I spent around four to five hourse in the whole museum, and was absolutely drained when I left the place. I didn’t realise how sick I was until I realised I didn’t even want to shop in the souvenir stores, which I regret because I would love to get a tote bag. I got some flu medicine on my way home.
I had wonderful impression of Quai-Branly. The level and scale are what I envision how a museum of “world anthropology” should be. I still don’t think any museum in the world would be fit for the title “wold anthropology” for a simple reason: All collectors have preferences that are derived from their generations of academic focus, and those preferences are the reason why many museums don’t have the same level of attention on all cultures. Take the zeal for Oceania and Pacific Islands for example, both Quai-Branly and MAA have extensive resources and materials from the region. However, when it comes to Asia, they are usually relatively ignorant. I have to say that I do feel jealous — if that is a fair term to use here — because of my heritage, but I also don’t want to take away people’s attention on any minority groups.
2. Le Louvre, 29 March 2024
As I scrolled through my photo album, I realised that I did not actually like Le Louvre as a museum. If you quickly scroll through this section and compare the amount I wrote about it with Museum d’Orsay (next), you will know which museum I prefer.
My first visit to Le Louvre nine years ago was mainly to tick the box of “see the Mona Lisa (La Joconde)”, which I should say was a half-tick, because I never really saw it in an appropriate distance. My impression for the rest of the galleries was a bit blurred, and this was what I planned to revisit and take a good look.
I couldn’t describe how weird I felt when I stood at the grand foyer, looking at at least three moving escalators extending and ascending to mezzanines. I couldn’t, however, describe why I felt the deju-vu unsettling until I wrote these words down: It was a memory of rushing and running through the corridors, feeling pressed and shame because I couldn’t see the paintings. I have a strange habit: If I don’t get to enjoy a good thing properly the first time, I somehow would avoid coming back and re-enjoy it again. Possibly out of guilt and embarrassment.
I studied the map a little bit and tried to figure out which galleries I possibly had visited before just to avoid them. I didn’t, so I just randomly hopped on one of the escalators and was taken to a broad court full of Roman sculptures. It was a strange space for a brief moment, but in a good sense: The court was quite far away from the early morning crowd who were sprinting towards the Mona Lisa, so I could only hear the low and muffled talking and shouting through the walls. The majority interior design, including the sculptures, was white, reflecting the light and the cloudy sky from a high glassed ceiling. There were only a few visitors and they were sitting on foldable chairs, focusing on their sketches. I guess they were art students. I felt like wondering in a giant bubble in a sci/art-fi movie. In retrospection I am glad that my visit began in a quiet corner instead of another immediate overwhelm.
My strategy for visiting route is wondering and meadering, and avoiding the Mona Lisa at all cost (which is wise for a reason). Overall, I wasn’t impressed by what I saw that day; however, I found something new and it was a nice surprise.
I hope that one day someone could explain to me how or why there is a room full of historical scientific instruments in the Sulley Gallery. For a brief moment I thought I was at the Whipple Museum French Branch, as I could point to every object and name them: Butterfield type sundial, possibly of Augsberg and French made; equinotical ring dial; diptych dial; compendium; astrolabe; compound microscope, etc.. I tried to find more information about provenance and acquisition details but there wasn’t too much about them on the Louvre website. I’m also really intrigued to find out the curatorial reason behind the public display as I don’t think they relate to any other “artistic” collections nearby.
It was wonderful to see the gallery of Egyptian mummies and I vaguely remembered seeing them during the first visit. No surprise, it was fully packed with visitors. I felt a bit uneasy because I thought of the issues of displaying human remains, and all the discussion as a museum professional. Seeing so many visitors still not caring at all about what I thought was strangely unsettling and relaxing: I don’t think museums would ever be able to tell everyone how to behave around human remains, especially something with such high profile. A proportion of visitors will forever remain ignorant and have no regard towards any cultural sensitivity. I’m not saying that museums should stop trying to raise the awareness of respect and privacy, but to forbid a certain approach based on reasons hard to judge, i.e. whether the photos were taken out of despise/entertaiment/respect, is also a restriction of speech and could potentially create another type of dominance.
I don’t think I would want to come back to the Louvre the third time. Aesthetically it is an amazing museum, but I don’t resonate with the collections inside.
3. Musée d’Orsay, 31 March 2024
Before this trip, whenever I mentioned that I had been to Paris (ten years ago, almost), I had to say that I regretted not going to Museum d’Orsay. Yes, I knew it was famous and a must-go, but the decade-ago me was more keen on ticking the bucket list and less a museum person.
One of my colleagues was a passionate advocat of the museum. “Absolutely gorgeous” she said. And I found myself standing under an enormous arc where the train used to stop, now stood stunning marble sculptures.
It was stunning to see all three sculptures (above) displayed ensemble. The clever use of bronze for the sitters’ complexion and the amazing texture of onyx for their outfits really brought out them to life. What’s more interested is the labels: All three sculptures were under different titles once, given by the artist. They were renamed to avoid outdated historical racism.
www.musee-orsay.fr
I am always a fan of watching how the westerners portrait what the world looks like to them. I started paying more attention to this type of creation when I visited the Frederiksborg Castle in Copenhagen, seeing the four corners painted on the ceiling of the Audience Room that depicted the four continents of the globe. I realised how distant it was for the artist to even grasp the concept of what Asia was: The corner painting featured a Turkish man with a turban and a glorious moustache; a camel kneeling beside him.
Contrary to putting a Turk as a representation for Asia, the bronze sculpture in Museum d’Orsay, created in the 19th century, featured a more East-Asian-looking person, possibly because of wars and trade in East Asia. I would say this is how geopolitics are involved in art. On a closer look, as I wrote down this late journal, I noticed that the Asian representation was actually a female (the bossom) with a male braid. How bizzare and intriguing! Was this an intentional decision by the artist? Or was this simply a mixed-up?
A great deal of my visit time was spent in the exhibition Paris 1874: Inventer l’impressionnisme, which in the beginning I didn’t plan to go. However, I couldn’t resist a free exhibition and the fabulous paintings by Monet, plus the queue was not crazy long. In the end, I made the little detour and joined the little crowd (which turned into a massive herd when I left).
I thought it was going to be a “nice and little” exhibition featuring Monet and others (who, unfortunately, I didn’t know. That’s why I only named Monet). Have I been more wrong than this? Probably not. It was an exhibition about impressionism, but it provided a profound historical context on the social change and artistic evolution that led towards the familiar style we know today. There were lots of sketches, photos, and archives that scafolded the beginning of impressionism before I finally saw the Sunrise painting. During the visit I sometimes felt quite embarrassed because I clearly was not up for such in-depth cultural education, especially I was planning on visiting a niche museum later that day.
Every time I see a chinoiserie style in a painting or as an interior design, I always feel surreal. As a child I felt that Eastern elements were strictly limited in Asia, and to see them in a western setting was like seeing an ostrich among chickens — odd and distinctive. Questions like “Did they already know where China and Japan were?”, “have they seen our stuffs already?” and “did they know any Asian person?” will always be in my head. I wonder if it’s the same surreal feeling for a westerner to see late Qing court paintings, which were profoundly influenced by Jesuit missionaries.
That was the last painting I took picture of in the exhibition. It was extremely crowded and noisy so it was a good time to get out of the place.
I became a fan of Cézanne during my teenage time. I appreciate the saturation of colour as well as the clear boundary lines he used.
“Les Âges de l’ouvrier” was a gem among all the artworks that I took picture of. Fédéric was a symbolist painter, which means that his artworks usually contained hints and audience needed to read between the lines. The painting is presented in a triptych, which resembles a traditional religious arrangement. Among the children playing cards (symbolising vice and greed) is a boy, behind who a basket at his head position resembles a saint’s halo.
I finally acscended to the second floor where I was surprised to find a large crowd at the restaurant, and an even larger crowd straining their necks in front of, not just anyone’s, but VAN GOGH’s famous painting of the yellow room. I am never a fan of Van Gogh, so I used this as an excuse and skirted through the gallery.
I was glad to finish my first visit to the Orsay with Monet’s most acclaimed artworks. It was definitely a brief visit, but I made sure I had time to go through all the galleries. If there was any regret, I would say it was that I didn’t get a tote bag (but I bought a T-shirt with Monet’s artwork!).
Overall, I like Museum d’Orsay. It’s incredibly large with amazing artworks; everyone is going to find a piece of art that they like. I appreciate the map and directions that point to the highlight for a quick visit. The audio guide was insightful, though I was hoping for a more flexible touch, such as the one I had in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. The gift shop was nice (I only realised the importance of a good gift shop after this visit and I may come up with a short post about why they are important) but the location was quite awkward.
4. Musée Fragonard, 31 March 2024
I left Museum d’Orsay about two o’clock. Rather early for me; I usually reserve a whole day for just one museum visit. However, I was on a mission to a special museum before I left Paris — Musée Fragonard.
Make no mistake, this is not the Perfume Museum and it has nothing to do with Fragonard the perfumist. I believe that the name Fragonard is a coincident, that this oldest veterinarian school in France happens to have the same name with the perfume brand.
The museum isn’t in the city centre and I had to spend almost an hour from Panthéon (a small detour after Museum d’Orsay) on bus. It was pouring and I felt like the bus was waddling through a sudden flood in Paris, but gladly the tempest died when I finally arrived. I spent some time asking around because I found myself in the middle of a college on a Sunday, when no one stayed in the classroom. Two ladies pointed me the way.
People who know me can always be certain that I’m a big fan of medicla museums. I was definintely gutted to learn later that Musée de l’Histoire de la Médecine was not open due to Easter holiday, but I still had the chance to visit something related — animal anatomy, or vet science.
The Fragonard Museum was definitely a quirky place that can be easily recognised as a university museum: It is tucked away in a humble teaching block; except a few signs and a sleepy security guard 500 meters away, there was no sign to direct the visitors.
I was, nevertheless, amazed by the enlarged teaching models neatly arranged in the display cases. I had never been to a historical vet science museum, so it was a little bit overwhelming at first (especially I only had two hours before the museum closed, and I intended to listen to every.audio.episode.)
Not to sound like a Y2K emo teen but I love anything that associates with death. The rituals that human plan and do in order to mark, remember, relieve, and avoid death are remarkable… They are the last chance for the dead to look back the living world, and the living to forsee what it will be like when we step into the unknown. Object that we study in order to understand death are similar to that. Is this the reason why museums now talk more about resepcting human remains? I wonder; but if bones of human beings are to be treated differently, how come we don’t apply the same attitude towards other animals’ bones? I also think about the lines between collections treated in a scientific and anthropological manner: If a human skull was collected for scientific racism study, it would migrate to repatriation based on anthropological reason. However, animals that sacrifice or were intentinally made ill for scientific purposes were less likely to be treated with anthropological sensitivity.
I wish that there were more textual labels along the display, as the audio guide did not help memorise (it was great content, though, very informative). Or perhaps I just need to find another way to record what I heard on the audio guide.
However, I managed to remember one thing from the audio guide. The pictures above showed the signature on one of the anatomical models, E. Petitcolin, dated 1901. It stands for Eugène Petitcolin, the preparator and model maker of the vet school.
My experience at the Whipple Museum left a valuable lesson in my mind, that all of the great scientific achievement would not have been possible were it not for the tool makers, publishers, etc.. Our education focuses a lot on the theories proposed by the great theoretician and philosophers, but not much time is spent on what compliment their success. Take Auzoux’s papier-mâché human model for example: Hundreds of thousands (an underestimation) of medical students would not have become doctors if there hadn’t been a chance to test their knowledge before practicing on patients. Some of the model makers even took their craftmanship to the next level: Not only were they accurate and precise, but the colour and material made these models, though mass produced, artistic, offering inspiration and perspective on life and the wonder of it.
Petitcolin worked his whole life for the vet school and was a pioneer in model making and preservation. I appreciate how the museum preserved these historical teaching tools, and it was wonderful that he gets to be featured in the tour. I think all museums should, if given chances, reflect upon the assistants and technicians that did the bidding. One example that I feel right is the rooms at the Centre of Material Culture (of MAA), which are named after Clare Isobel Fell (archaeologist, 1912–2002), Samuel Cowles (museum assistant), and Maureen M. O’Reilly (assistant curator), who were women and assistant dedicating their lives to the work, but not necessarily remembered in the history.
However, this is not the highlight of the Fragonard Museum.
! Attention!
The photo below contain human remains. Readers’ discretion advised.
These are écorchées, or the flayed collections. Made by Honoré Fragonard (1732–1799), who used to teach anatomy in the vet school, these are considered the treasures of the museum. The technique that Fragonard employed is still not fully understood. I could see that this was dry specimen, and I assumed that the material involved a lot of wax, hence the shiny gloss on the surface. My impression was proved right when I read later, that these creations were made not based on anatomical studies, but more for a theatrical performance. I definitely felt the intense glare from the first standing man, Goliath. I feel very fortunate that I am not bothered by such beautiful creation because I can imagine many people shying away, and I understand that.
This is probably the longest post I’ve written in English so far. I’ve waited a long time before I even started writing it, and procrastinated several times because life since April has been like being strapped on a rocket while skating on icy road, totally chaotic.
I have a mixture of positive and negative views on Paris as a city and the two visits I’ve made so far. I think it is a wonderful metropolitan: sleek, chic, vibrant, and everyone can have a place; and yet I don’t feel like I can find a place there, just as I feel about London. However, this is not a travel blog.
As for museums, I absolutely give them a five star overall. During this trip, I have ticked more boxes on my bucket list, without loosing the quality and depth that I was looking for. The regret that I didn’t get to visit Museum of the History of Medicine is a strong reason to bring me back to this city.

Paris: where Love, Creativity, and Perfection Converge.
This day one year ago,
we were admiring the perfectly planned lanes of Paris while standing on the famous,
brilliantly marketed,
iconic Eiffel Tower
We watched Paris basking in the golden glow of the setting sun,
and then it all started to twinkle and looked even more beautiful and serene as evening descended.
Damn!
I admired the vision through which the city was planned.
I also read about its history, even though we walked over 15,000 steps a day. Human creativity and vision know no bounds.
At that time, I wasn’t sure if it was pressure, punishment, or reward, but they designed a freakishly beautiful city that endures even after you leave it.
So, as you stroll through the lanes of Paris, it dawns on you that something this grand can be created with stunning detail.
Perfectionism isn’t just a term;
It’s something that can and should be pursued.
If you do so,
you can create something that stands out
and remains eternal
for ages to come.
And even though it’s a big crazy city, with constant traffic and crowded metro rides,
there is love in the air!
There’s something so (geographically!) blessed about the air that it heals you.
You immediately miss someone in Paris and want to return with them. (This could be true for any city in Europe though!)
I met my husband after a month in Paris;
he stayed for two weeks longer than I did.
The first thing I said when he picked me up at the airport was, ‘This air is so healing.’ As the quote says —
“Breathe in Paris, It nourishes the soul” — Victor Hugo
So the air and city itself is enough to fill your heart, and yeah, it leaves a strong impression that you’d wish to witness this grandness again.
“A walk in Paris will provide lessons history, beauty, and in the point of life.
We did talk about history and astonishing beauty,
What is the point of life that you see by looking out from the Eiffel Tower?
One takeaway for me is that boundless creativity and perfection exist.
There is nothing wrong with obsessing over perfection.
You might as well build something resembling Paris!

I returned to Paris last week, still feeling bruised by the US election. I had volunteered for the Harris campaign in Pennsylvania in the month leading up to Nov 5., and I was so relieved that Teresa my beloved spouse and I were at last able to resume our carefree life as flâneurs in Paris. Flâneur is a most delightful French word that means to wander about without specific purpose, just observing the world.
Relieved, yes. But I still felt a lump of dread in the pit of my stomach like an undigested rotten sausage.
The weather was grey and rainy — not surprising for mid-November in Paris, but not really conducive to long walks or for lifting one’s mood. Teresa, however, needed some replacement light bulbs. So one afternoon last week, a trip to the hardware store was mandatory. The rain was not stopping, so finally, I just said fuck it, and headed out into the drizzle.
The route to the hardware store lay along one of my favorite walks, the Coulée Vert, or “Greenway.” It’s a disused tram line that has been repurposed and replanted as an urban garden path — if you…

Revoir Paris | Essay Three
I spent a month in Paris, this time, and could simply be there, live there, and revisit places and experiences that I have loved.
Mostly it didn’t rain.
As the days passed under skies of blue or mother-of-pearl, and I relearned the layout of favorite boulevards and quarters and how to take buses everywhere, and eventually mastered how to make it back to the hotel tucked into a sidestreet without first overshooting the mark, Paris began to feel more familiar than ever it had before.
Perhaps I could finally live there because in previous visits I had ticked the tourist sites off the list, and made the big-ticket historical, artistic, and literary pilgrimages, and thus had no further itch to scratch.
Or perhaps it was because while there I turned seventy (which was the idea) and brought to the adventure a mellowing soul.
I think it was the latter reason, mostly, but also because I had flown to peacetime Paris from a war zone and could remind myself viscerally and experientially of what I know intellectually: that a whole, beckoning world exists that is not at war, and that in the absence of war, life can be brilliant, creative, and happy.
Paris has not always been at peace, of course.
Some people know about the Hundred Years’ War between England and France (1337–1453).
Everyone in the world has heard about the French Revolution (1789–1799) — and some know of the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) and the Paris Commune (1871). [1]
Many people know about the high price in blood paid by the French in WWI; some would argue that this led a still shell-shocked populace to follow WWI hero Philippe Pétain into WWII collaboration with Hitler.
If you notice shrapnel-pockmarked building facades from the Nazi era, or memorial signage on buildings, you will learn of Vichy (French) police roundups of Jews and Gestapo executions of Resistants in the very heart of Paris. [2] & [3]
But on this day especially, the world — my whole world — became a jewel box (the Théâtre du Palais-Royal [4]) nested within a coffer (the Domaine national du Palais-Royal) nested within a treasure chest (the Palais-Royal quarter of the 1st arrondissement).
I paused at the southern entrance to the Jardin du Palais-Royal to admire Paravent Girls [5], an Art Basel Paris bronze installation by Egyptian multimedia artist Ghada Amer [6], and then flânered the lovely garden’s length.
I was on my way to the Théâtre du Palais-Royal to meet my cousin and her husband at a performance of L’extraordinaire Destinée de Sarah Bernhardt:
The stage goddess (b. 1844 — d. 1923) lived a hard-working, celebrated life, [7] and like today’s rock stars and pop divas, toured the world “collecting men and animals, having a baby with a prince. . . and doing it all with extravagance, humor, and unfailing commitment.” [8]
The producers were wise to stage the show in so sumptuous a playhouse! Seated on red velvet — or velour? — inside so gilded and plush a venue, one can’t pretend for a second that one has not come to lose oneself entirely in theatrical magic.
Now it is Saturday night at dusk in sharp weather. Night is rapidly falling as my cousin’s husband, Alain, shepherds us across Place Colette, where a crowd couples-dances en plein air to a live jazz and blues orchestra.
We wait on a curb at a red light in a drizzle. From afar, shimmering ice-blue diamonds jet and spill up and down the height of the Eiffel Tower [9]; the Tuileries’ Roue de Paris (ferris wheel) glitters like a diamond-studded hoop suspended in air.
Alain hails us a cab on Avenue de l’Opéra; the grand thoroughfare pulses with neon signage and street lamps and head and tail lights that shimmer off the wet pavement as if they are sequins and gemstones: rubies, diamonds, emeralds!
A switch flips in my neurocircuitry already buzzing from having been to the theater. But now outside in the dark amid festive crowds, the myriad lights have jolted me even more widely awake and strongly alive.
Sparklers go fizzing and blazing through my arteries. My whole bloodstream effervesces! If I weren’t bundled in a fleece jumper and down vest, my skin would be emitting visible sparks.

When I was in college, I was part of a student organization whose goal is to facilitate the onboarding of international students by organizing meetups, dinners, and events.
I met and spent a lot of time with students from all walks of life. Among them, I found a special connection with French.
This bond wasn’t just about shared interests or hobbies; it went deeper, touching on I believe shared values, philosophies, and outlooks on life.
Something about their simplicity, authenticity, and rawness fascinated me.
I met more than twenty French students in college. Not all at the same time. But I’ve always found myself spending time with them. Hanging out. Going out. Drinking at a local bar. Eating at a Chinese restaurant.
As a matter of fact, my go-to friend group in college consisted of 60% French. I’ve always felt home with them. Always felt happy with them.
It’s funny because a lot of Americans dislike French people as they can come off as rude or uptight. Some even complain about how they reek of cigarettes. I even have friends of mine who had terrible experience when they visited Paris because of these and some say it’s overrated.

And I’m (finally) okay with that.
I’ve done my fair share of traveling — much more than I ever would have thought I would when I was much younger. I’ve been to many more than half of the states in the United States. I have been to Europe a handful of times and have enjoyed the sights and sounds of at least ten countries over there. I’ve been to Canada and Mexico. I’ve been to a significant number of islands in the Caribbean.
Sounds pretty good, if I do say so myself.
It’s just that there has been this one location — this one place — this one dream vacation spot of a lifetime, that has eluded me for lo these many years.
That locale — the stuff of fantasy and romance — is, of course, Paris.
These weren’t postcards from places I had actually seen. Nope, as a child my family’s annual vacation destination was our local zoo.
These were postcards I begged for from friends, family, friends of the family and the family of friends.
Anyone, going anywhere, all I asked was a cool shot of something tourist worthy. For the most part, I was indulged in my requests.

(France) Paris: Where Art Meets Life — My Journey Through the City of Lights,https://medium.com/@cosmoviolet/france-paris-where-art-meets-life-my-journey-through-the-city-of-lights-9adfc2e653fe,"Sign up

Hey there, travel buddies! It’s your girl back with another adventure that literally broke my blog last month (100K visitors in one day? I’m still in shock!). So grab your favorite drink, get comfy, and let me take you through the cobblestone streets of Paris — a city that feels both exactly like and nothing like what you’d expect.
I’ve been to 47 countries, but there’s something about Paris that keeps pulling me back. Maybe it’s the way the light hits the Seine at sunset, or how the smell of fresh baguettes seems to follow you everywhere. Or maybe it’s just because I’m a total art nerd who can spend hours staring at one painting (spoiler alert: I did exactly that at the Orsay).
Let’s start with the Musée d’Orsay, which honestly deserves its own fan club. First things first — this place used to be a train station! I mean, talk about a glow-up, right? The moment you walk in, you’re hit with this incredible ceiling that makes you wonder why we ever stopped building beautiful things.
I arrived at opening time (pro tip: always, ALWAYS arrive at opening time) and made a beeline for the Impressionist galleries on the top floor. The thing about the Orsay that nobody tells you is how the natural light changes everything. Van Gogh’s self-portrait at 9:30 am hits completely different than at noon.
I spent a ridiculous three hours just on the fifth floor. No regrets. Standing in front of Monet’s water lilies, I literally forgot I had a flight to catch the next day. Some American couple next to me was arguing about where to have lunch, and I wanted to shake them and say, “DO YOU NOT SEE THIS MASTERPIECE RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU?!” But I kept it cool. Mostly.
After the Orsay, I desperately needed caffeine, so I ducked into this tiny café called Le Petit Cler that wasn’t in any guidebook. The barista took one look at my camera and said in perfect English, “Another tourist who thinks they’ll find the real Paris?” I laughed and asked him in my terrible French where the real Paris was. He smiled, wrote down an address on my receipt, and said, “Go there after the Louvre. Trust me.”
(Spoiler: I did go, and it was this incredible little jazz bar where I ended up dancing with an 80-year-old Parisian gentleman who told me stories about meeting Picasso when he was a child. Some experiences you just can’t plan!)
After my mystery café recommendation, I headed to the Louvre. Listen, this place is MASSIVE. Like, you-could-spend-a-week-here-and-not-see-everything massive. I’ve been three times now and I’m pretty sure there are entire wings I haven’t discovered yet.
Here’s my controversial Louvre take: skip the Mona Lisa on your first visit. I KNOW, I KNOW. But hear me out. The crowd around her is insane, you’ll barely see her, and there are literally thousands of other incredible pieces that you can actually get close to and enjoy without someone’s selfie stick in your face.
Instead, I wandered through the Egyptian antiquities section and found myself completely alone with artifacts that are over 4,000 years old. ALONE. With HISTORY. In what universe does that make sense while hundreds of people are fighting for a glimpse of La Joconde?
But the real magic of the Louvre happens when you get lost. Seriously, put away the map for 30 minutes and just wander. I turned a random corner and stumbled upon The Winged Victory of Samothrace with no one else around. Just me and this 2,200-year-old masterpiece having a moment together. I may have teared up a little.
The thing about Paris that my Instagram can never fully capture is what happens between the museums. Walking from the Orsay to the Louvre along the Seine, I watched an elderly couple dancing to an accordion player near Pont Neuf. They must have been in their 80s, moving slowly but with such grace that several tourists (myself included) just stopped to watch.
Later that afternoon, I got completely lost near Le Marais and found myself in a tiny square where local children were playing soccer while their parents chatted on benches. One little boy kicked the ball my way, and before I knew it, I was in an impromptu soccer game with a bunch of French kids who thought my terrible footwork was hilarious.
These moments — the ones between the famous sites — are what make Paris magical. The way light falls through tree branches onto century-old buildings. The sound of church bells mixing with scooter horns. The smell of rain on warm pavement outside a bakery. You can’t plan for these things, but they’re what you’ll remember most.
Alright, time for some real talk about cash. Paris has a reputation for being expensive, and yes, it absolutely can be if you’re not careful. But it doesn’t have to break the bank!
Between the Orsay and the Louvre, I spent an entire afternoon at Café de Flore, just watching Paris go by. Three hours, two coffees, one glass of wine, and approximately 5,000 interesting characters later, I realized I’d just had one of the best experiences of my trip without doing anything at all.
A fashionable elderly woman at the table next to mine noticed me watching everyone and said in accented English, “The best art in Paris is the people, yes?” We ended up chatting for an hour about how she modeled for Dior in the 1960s. Marie, if you’re somehow reading this, you were the highlight of my trip!
Here’s what surprised me most: Paris isn’t perfect. And that’s what makes it perfect.
The metro sometimes smells questionable. Some waiters really are rude (though most aren’t if you attempt even terrible French). There are tourist traps and pickpockets and overpriced cafés.
But there’s also the bookseller along the Seine who gave me a free vintage postcard when I bought a worn copy of Hemingway. The baker who threw in an extra pain au chocolat “because you look hungry.” The stranger who walked me to my hotel when I got lost after midnight.
Paris isn’t a postcard; it’s a living, breathing city with mood swings and secrets and stories. It’s not always beautiful, but it’s always authentic. And that’s why I keep coming back.
So friends, has this convinced you to book that flight yet? Drop me a comment about your Paris dreams or questions, and I promise to answer every single one. Next week, I’ll be sharing my fool-proof packing list for a week in Paris with just a carry-on (yes, it’s possible, even for a chronic over-packer like me).
Until next time, remember what the French say: “La vie est belle, mais Paris la rend extraordinaire.” Life is beautiful, but Paris makes it extraordinary.
À bientôt! ✨

Deliberately choosing to visit France in September — right after the 2024 Olympics turned out to be a great decision for me. The places I visited were less crowded, allowing me to take my time and even meet up with dear friends whom I hadn’t seen in a very long time because we lived on different continents.
I spent the last two days of my delightful trip to France in Paris, savoring delicious French cuisine, visiting iconic landmarks, and immersing myself in the diverse Parisian culture. During my time there, I had the pleasure of meeting up with another dear friend who traveled from Brussels to join me.
One time, we were trying to go to the Arc de Triomphe and we made a wrong turn and ended up taking the metro in the opposite direction of where we were supposed to go. We found ourselves at the final stop of a metro line in a neighborhood on the outskirts of Paris. Despite the unexpected detour, I didn’t worry. My friend and I laughed so hard and took it as part of the adventure…

toThe term ‘Paris Syndrome’ was created in 1986 by professor Professor Hiroaki Ota. He explained it as ‘a severe shock that can require hospitalisation’.
Wait, there’s more.
According to this article from Huffington Post,
“The Japanese Embassy in Paris now has a 24-hour hotline for Japanese tourists suffering from the syndrome, whose symptoms can range from depression and anxiety to acute delusional states, dizziness, sweating, hallucinations and “feelings of persecution.”
The reason?
According to professor Mathieu Deflem from the University of South Carolina, it’s because of drastically different cultures and ‘unmet romantic expectations’.
I even have friends who’ve told me that they were disappointed in Paris, but here’s why I still love the city.
My first experience in Paris was when I was 21. My uncle and I were travelling to Paris and Milan, but I arrived a day early and was alone in Paris for the day.
What happened next was an incident that changed my life forever.
Going to cut the long story short.
I met a Syrian man via Couchsurfing. We met at the banks of the river La Seine where the locals were chilling. We just looked at the river and spoke. Between us was his airbag with local cheese, wine, homemade beetroot and classic hummus and pita bread.
He was a journalist and told me how he’s lost his home and a lot of his family.
In the middle of talking about the refugee incidents he has experienced and covered at work, what struck me was this particular sentence,
“You think your life is hard? Think about sitting in a boat and not knowing if you’ll ever see land again. Do this for days, and that life is hard.”
It changed my perspective on everything.
Here’s a detailed article about it if you want to read it later.
Even back then, there were certain challenges.
The menu was entirely in French. People wouldn’t respond in English. But you know what? I don’t see an issue with it.
I’m from India. And it’s painful to see how talking in English is a way of social stratification today. You’re automatically ‘cool’ and ‘well educated’ if you can talk fluently in English.
I mean… this is like Stockholm Syndrome.
When I visited Edinburgh Castle in Scotland, I saw how most jewels there belonged to the kings and queens of India. We were looted and ripped off so bad that we’re relatively poor even today. Yet, we cannot get out of our colonisation by pitting against each other.
The world doesn’t need to be fluent in English.
And here’s a trick that works if you really want the French to be nice to you.
Something that amused me was — each time I spoke in broken French, I got answers in fluent English.
But when I spoke in English, I just got cold nods.
It’s funny, but it underlines how showing a little bit of respect that you’re at least trying to talk in their language warms their heart. Warms mine too, when I see a foreigner speaking in Hindi.
Just saying ‘Bonjour’ can help.
Like everything else, it’s always the little things, isn’t it?
Another thing that helps regardless of the city is to be a traveler instead of a tourist.
Ditch tours, hop-in-hop-off, and the big shiny spots.
Walk into lanes of Montmartre, eat local breakfast, and let go of expensive tickets for the Eiffel view because the view is best enjoyed for free… by the river.
My mum and I visited Paris this August and sat here with some rosé and snacks and had a beautiful time watching the Eiffel light up at night. We also witnessed two proposals!
You don’t see this stuff paying 300 euros for an ‘Eiffel view’ table.
Talking about food, ditch your Instagram famous cafes.
I promise you, the bread you eat at a local boulangerie would be to die for. It’ll be fresh, soulful, and unlike any bread you’ve ever had.
I went to the famous cafe, Ladurée, and ordered eggs benedict. I paid 3.5 euros extra for spinach. Do you know what I got? Two brioches with a diameter of 2 cm and one small leaf of spinach on each.
It was such a tiny meal!
Meanwhile, here’s a local breakfast at a cafe:
France has made me fall in love with breads so much that I tried to find local bread in the 5 other countries I visited during my trip in August.
It’s worth the hype.
Paris is notorious for thefts and being unsafe. But each place has a reputation and as somebody who has solo travelled, I recommend you to follow the basics that you would anywhere else:
I’d follow this in Amsterdam, Berlin, and Melbourne too.
Doesn’t matter where you go, but being responsible for your own safety is better than being sorry later and blaming others.
Lastly, I’d like to end by — give everything a chance instead of dwelling on preconceived notions.
My biggest lesson while solo travelling at 21 was to view the world as a blank slate and let experiences fill in the colour.
I met a woman at a bus stop in Stockholm, Sweden. She was American-Chinese and first asked me if I’ll be ‘allowed’ to wear the dress I was wearing right now in India. I affirmed that obviously, I am. Why would I not be?
She told me that she’s always wanted to visit India, but it’s portrayed as being unsafe.
I swear, if you follow some protocols, it’s not unsafe at all. But if you do things which as a local even I won’t do, then it’s inviting trouble.
Paris is still romantic for couples and lovely for a family holiday. The people are warm, and the bread is even warmer.
Yes, some streets are dirty. But I’ve heard the same goes for New York and San Francisco.
Hop on to the other side, Champs-Élysées is so gorgeous.
Give places and people a chance. Don’t let media or a few bitter experiences fill your head.
Finally, try to explore like a local. That’s what differentiates tourists from travellers, in my opinion.

“It has bothered me all my life that I do not paint like everybody else.”
On the first Monday of summer, June 5, 1905, the Gare de Lyon train station teemed with fashionable Parisians preparing for their annual journey to the south of France. Only they preferred Côte d’Azur — like it was a club with an admissions committee, an invited guest list, a velvet rope, and a charming hostess waiting to welcome them. To them, paradise was a familiar word, wrapped in the routine and privilege of their opulent lives. They imagined strolling arm-in-arm down sunlit promenades, exchanging knowing glances with others who happened to look, dress, and speakl just like them. It was so comforting to be seated at seaside cafés, secure in one’s place — and equally certain that, beyond their tiny polished circle, little else really mattered. They were happy people, perhaps ridiculously so.
A different story awaited in the third-class compartment: thirty-six-year-old Henri Matisse wasn’t chasing the sun; he was escaping ruin. Although he too was once welcomed in Parisian society, he now wore a corduroy suit like a prison uniform, faded to a reddish-brown, and blending into the threadbare seat beneath him. He looked more vineyard worker than artist — save for the paintbox and collapsible easel at his feet. His face was etched with lines from sleepless nights and empty pockets, carrying the weight of three years of failure and rejection. This was the new Henri Matisse, one who had aged and fallen. Had you whispered to his fellow passengers that one day he would shake the art world to its core the laughter would have been raucous and infectious.
Even his wife, Amélie, who sat next to him, would give you a skeptical glance. Even her expression was tense with quiet concern, and this was no leisurely getaway to the Riviera. The couple wasn’t bound for seaside promenades serenaded by Mediterranean breezes. They had no home to go to, and no friends when they arrived. In fact were escaping a life that had unraveled, fleeing to a place that might offer at least a reprieve from despair if not the justice system.
Matisse’s fall from grace had been sharp. The Parisian art world once welcomed him with cautious optimism, but now turned its delicate pale back. Friends disappeared, patrons closed their wallets, and a once-promising career had sputtered. It was his fault, too. Rumors of a financial scandal hovered around him like a thick fog, deepening his isolation. Once a successful lawyer, Matisse abandoned that career to follow his passion for painting, but now even that seemed as enticing as a wet pavement.
As the train pulled out of the station, leaving behind the familiar smells of crusty baguettes, pungent cheeses, and steaming bowls of oxtail soup, Matisse cast a final glance at his former home. He was leaving behind more than Paris; he was abandoning a world that seemed so full of promise, now reduced to broken dreams. Yet, as the train chugged along the tracks, his mood astonishingly began to lift. Amid the despair, a quiet resolve began to take root. The storm within him receded as Matisse made a vow — he would find his voice again, silence the doubts, and reclaim his life on his own terms.
No matter how long it took.
Which is what is so ironic about the story of Henri Matisse in Collioure. Little did he or anyone else realize that in just 100 days, this trek south would not only transform his career but reshape the entire art world, leading to one of the most revolutionary periods in the history of painting.
In fact, Paris would never look at a canvas the same way again.
But what was about to happen wasn’t a miracle nor an act of faith. It was something deeper and perhaps more fundamental to the human condition. Henri Matisse was about to discover a Thrive Zone — a place where the spirit is liberated, creativity reignited, and the soul is fully restored. These are places where we become ourselves in spite of the rest of the world telling us not to be.
This is the story of how one summer in a small fishing village in the south of France set the stage for a transformation that would forever alter Matisse — and leave an indelible mark on the world of art.
“There are flowers everywhere for those who want to see them.”
A cynic would say every form of refuge has its a price. For Henri Matisse, his career suffered from entrapment in the bleak industrial landscape of Normandy. As a young boy growing up there, life was marked by the unrelenting grayness, suffocated by coal dust. He believed the world was colored in sodden skies, and monotony was the color of choice. Matisse would later recall, “Women wore black, and everyone wore a hat. It is a place where people don’t expect too many strangers.”
Even Art historian Hilary Spurling noted this was true, his early works were “restrained and traditional,” lacking the spark that would later come to define his painting. Only the public wasn’t interested in somber landscapes — it craved beauty, spectacle, and illusion.
Desperate for cash, Matisse even offered one of his canvases to his brother Auguste for 100 francs. The reply was as frigid as the Norman winter: “I’d rather have a new bicycle.” But the struggle was about more than selling paintings. Matisse was caught in a larger battle, a fight to find his place in a world that seemed hopelessly duplicitous and divided. He valued integrity in expression more than wealth, but now he was bereft of both.
Born in 1869 during the twilight of the Victorian era, Matisse’s formative years spanned the Belle Époque — a time of shimmering contradictions. Paris, the “City of Light,” was both a beacon of modernity and a place of deep inequality as well as rigid social structure. The elite lived in the glow of freshly minted francs, while the working classes toiled in the shadows. The surface gleamed, but underneath, resentment simmered.
It was into this paradoxical cauldron, where new industrial fortunes clashed with the remnants of old-world aristocracy, that Matisse and his wife Amélie found themselves thrust — while the working classes — barely literate, and so barely counted — were left to their laughter, tobacco pipes, and homemade plum wine. The glittering surface of society masked deep divisions — while the elite flaunted their wealth, resentment simmered among the lower classes.
It was how the Matisse’s became collateral damage in one of the most infamous financial scandals of their time — the Humbert Affair. A master manipulator named Thérèse Humbert had defrauded thousands through an audacious Ponzi scheme, borrowing nearly 100 million francs based on the collateral of a fictitious inheritance. By sheer misfortune, the Matisse family became entangled.
Matisse’s father in law was arrested, and the artist, a former lawyer, came to his defense. He wasn’t a conspirator, but the scandal stained his reputation and he became swept up in the deluge. And as the Humbert empire crumbled, so too did the Matisse’s stature. He found himself facing public outrage and financial ruin.
Stripped of dignity and resources, the couple with their inlaws had to fleeParis, no longer sure of their place in the world. Yet, what they sought in the south wasn’t luxury — it was something else, renewal it would turn out. Matisse was no longer simply searching for a place to escape; he was searching for a space to thrive.
“We ought to view ourselves with the same curiosity and openness with which we study a tree, the sky or a thought.”
Thérèse Humbert was the architect of one of the most notorious frauds in French history. Her rise to the top of Parisian society had been built on audacious lies, and equally fake noble lineage. To bolster her imagined wealth, she concocted an elaborate story about saving the life of a fictional American millionaire, Robert Crawford, who, according to her story, had gratefully left her a vast fortune. For over two decades, Humbert borrowed millions against this supposed inheritance, living a life of luxury while her lenders, many of them ordinary citizens, were left in the dark.
Through a web of deceit that had gone undetected for years — protected by her father-in-law, a Minister of Justice — Humbert finally acquired a newspaper owned by Armand Parayre, Henri Matisse’s father-in-law. This tangled connection dragged the Matisse family into the scandal’s orbit, even though they were unwitting victims themselves. But when the supposed inheritance was revealed to be nothing but a single red brick, the scandal erupted and scapegoats were needed.
France was outraged. The Humberts fled, leaving ruin in their wake. And while Matisse and his family although not accomplices, were tainted by their association. It took very little time before they found themselves swept up in the aftermath of one of the country’s largest Ponzi schemes.
The financial ruin, public scandal, and professional rejection that surrounded Matisse pushed him further toward collapse. No longer able to support his family or continue his art with any hope of stability, Matisse felt crushed by the weight of his failures. The Parisian society that had once nurtured his ambition now seemed intent on devouring him.
Yet, in the face of this disaster, the fall became the prelude to something greater.
The seeds of transformation were planted.
“I would like to recapture that freshness of vision which is characteristic of extreme youth when all the world is new to it.”
Sometimes, utter rejection is the precursor of renewal. For Matisse, this state of affairs forced him to seek refuge not just from scandal and poverty, but from the creative limitations he had unknowingly imposed on himself. Desperate and exhausted, Matisse and his wife Amélie left Paris for a small fishing village near the Spanish border.
Collioure wasn’t St. Tropez as they couldn’t afford the luxuries of the French Riviera that Paris’s elite were accustomed to. Instead, they found themselves in a fishing village hit hard by economic ruin and the collapse of its anchovy trade and vineyards, ravaged by the Phylloxera plague. The town, at first glance, appeared worn, scarred by decline and poverty.
Yet to Matisse, it held something far more precious than wealth.
“The light here is different,” Matisse would later say.
It wasn’t just an illusion either. Collioure had unfiltered Mediterranean light that revealed colors that Matisse had never seen before — due to the only East facing coastline in France where the Pyranees majestically seem to dive into the water. The reflections of the sea, the interplay of light and shadow, the vivid hues that soaked into the village streets — became his metaphor. A light which casts no shadows and eradicates contrasts. It was a new artistic language, one that spoke to him in a way that Paris never could.
Where others saw a town in decline, Matisse saw a world bursting with possibility. The decay of the fishing industry and the blighted vineyards faded into the background. For the first time in years, Matisse felt a spark of creative energy return. His focus shifted away from survival and toward the rediscovery of beauty.
The transition was profound. In Paris, Matisse had been trapped in a world of muted tones, of compromise and caution. But in Collioure, he began to embrace boldness, color, and exuberance. The sun-drenched hues of the Mediterranean landscape — lavenders, blues, deep reds, and oranges — burst into his work, freeing him from the restraint that had shackled his earlier paintings.
This was no accident. Collioure had become more than just a change of scenery; it had become Matisse’s personal Thrive Zone.
A Thrive Zone isn’t just a place to live or work; it’s a place where one’s potential is not only nurtured but liberated. It’s an environment where time takes on a different momentum, allowing creativity, growth, and transformation to flourish.
In Collioure, Matisse found exactly that — a space where the constraints of his old life could no longer bind him, where his art could breathe and expand beyond anything he had imagined in Paris.
“What I dream of is an art of balance, of purity and serenity, devoid of troubling or depressing subject matter, something like a good armchair.”
The pinnacle of this transformation came in the form of one of Matisse’s first works of the summer of 1905 appropriately titled, Open Window, Collioure. It wasn’t just a painting — it was a declaration of freedom that overcame him as he gazed from his hotel window.
In this work, Matisse blurred the boundaries between interior and exterior, between the familiar and the unknown. The colors — vivid and alive — reflected his internal transformation. Where traditional art sought to mimic life, Matisse’s work was life, vibrating with the energy of the Mediterranean.
Gone were the muted tones and tight brushstrokes that had once defined his work. In Collioure, Matisse embraced a radical new approach to color and form. His brushstrokes were loose, unrestrained, and alive. This work wasn’t just a product of technique, he was the same artist he had been in Paris just a week earlier — it was the product of an environment.
The vibrant colors of Collioure found their way into the depth of Matisse’s discouragement, and for the first time in his life, he felt free to paint in a way that was entirely his own. The shift was so dramatic that it left the Parisian art world stunned. Open Window and the thirty other paintings Matisse completed that summer heralded the birth of Fauvism, a revolutionary movement that would redefine modern art.
In one summer in 1905 he would paint over 50 pieces, and three of the ten greatest works of his life. Of course, the critics in Paris, accustomed to the soft realism of the old masters, were appalled. Matisse’s use of color was too wild, his forms too chaotic. His work was dubbed “Fauvism,” meaning “wild beasts,” a derogatory term meant to criticize the audacity of the movement.
But Matisse, like the light of Collioure, was undeterred. He had found his Thrive Zone, and he would never again return to the constraints of his old life.
“You can’t help getting old, but you can help becoming old.”
Henri Matisse once said, “There are flowers for those who want to see them.” But perhaps the deeper question isn’t why we see flowers — but who plants them in the first place. In Collioure, Matisse found not just refuge but renewal. Freed from the biting skepticism of Parisian critics who had dismissed his work as “scribblings of a wild beast,” he discovered a simpatico community — comrades who shared his love of nature and painted alongside him, as well as villagers who embraced his curious habit of standing before a canvas all day. Among them, he painted with abandon, as if creating art were play, not work.
For him, the humble fishing village was more than a refuge from Parisian humidity or a place of cheap lodgings. It was where the “flowers” of creativity were planted — a nurturing environment that welcomed his restless, rebellious spirit and spoke to his innermost feelings and beliefs.
Mornings spent painting in a modest studio overlooking the beach flowed effortlessly into afternoons of fish stew and Picpoul de Pinet. The Mediterranean light transformed the village’s modest facades into shimmering mosaics of lavender, red, and blue. Even the coarse shouts of fishermen, carried on salt-laden breezes in ancient Occitan, held an unexpected poetry.
What Matisse found in Collioure wasn’t merely an inspirational technique — it was a shift in his approach to life and art. He was no longer bound by the expectations of Parisian society or trapped by the weight of public opinion. The unpretentious simplicity of the village loosened the grip of doubt, reigniting his confidence and freeing him to create on his own terms. In this overlooked corner of the Mediterranean, Matisse found his muse, his sanctuary, and, ultimately, his transformation.
Not long after, he settled permanently in nearby Nice, drawn by the same energy that had unlocked his potential in Collioure — a place where he would spend the rest of his days until age 84.
Matisse’s story exemplifies a universal truth: the right environment can unlock potential in ways that talent or ambition alone cannot. It is the fusion of place, purpose, and opportunity that creates the conditions for extraordinary success. Yet finding such a place is only part of the journey. Liberating oneself from the constraints of our current environment — from the doubts, the criticisms, the expectations, and the customs that bind us — is often the greater challenge. To do so requires stunning independence and personal leadership.
Matisse left Paris at age 36 a struggling artist. He returned three months later transformed — his confidence renewed, his technique revolutionized, and his reputation on the rise.
Within a season, he had become a rival to Picasso. Collioure was more than a village; it was the point where talent and opportunity converged, where greatness and place became inseparable. Collioure, then, was not just a haven — it was Matisse’s Thrive Zone.

There are places so legendary that we all make a story about them without even experiencing them in reality. We see them in photos, make movies about them, and we can name their main sights just by catching a glimpse of them. And all of these, without putting a foot on their ground.
One of these places is, naturally, Paris. When I think of Paris, I hear Edith Piaf singing about “La Vie en Rose.” I sense the scent of freshly baked croissants and Chanel 5, and I see myself wearing a scarf near the Eiffel Tower on a rainy spring afternoon. This is my screenplay after watching too many French movies as a child.
If I had been born years after, Emily and her perception of Paris would probably have influenced my imagined memories, and I’m not sure this is real.
The French say Paris isn’t that authentic France; it’s dirty, crowded, and expensive — not that the rest of France isn’t, I might add.
Still, I discovered my Paris on a different note. First of all, it wasn’t love at first sight. Oh, not at all. It was that feeling when finally meeting after years and years an old clandestine lover. Even if he lost some of his rich hair and wasn’t that young anymore, that spark that brought the lovers together didn’t fade despite the odd circumstances.

In my opinion, most restaurants in the world would qualify as good not great, and very few are truly excellent. When I travel, I put in hours of research to try to find the great and excellent restaurants. Luckily, there are plenty of amazing options in Paris. I always wish I had more days and more stomach space to continue exploring. While I was happy with most of my picks from my recent trips in 2024 and 2023, some were clear misses. Of course you never know when a restaurant is having an off day or if you ordered the wrong things or if you were just too full or too tired to really appreciate it. Since I’ve only been to most of these places one time, I would not completely write off any of them if you hear good things from someone else. However, I will personally not be returning to the ones I say to skip!

We came to France to visit Nantes, where my son lives. But I would love to travel to Paris too, so we will stay here for two days and then go to Nantes. We must stop in Paris and taste it again. But we end up in a food coma. We are going to cram Paris in just two days. But this time around, I found something unexpected.
The skies were clear as we landed at Charles de Gaulle airport. Our United flight 990 was unexpectedly impressive. They fed us terrible food the entire time, but the staff was friendly. Get a cab to town next; don’t take the Metro with all your heavy bags after the long trip. We did that once and deeply regretted it. Make sure you find the official ones, which are found at sortie 24. Don’t fall for the gypsies.
We rented an Air B&B in Le Marais at Rue Vielles de Temple. Usually, the pictures look better, but this one was the exact opposite. If you rent an Air B&B when you travel to Paris, remember to arrange for the owner to meet at the door because, unlike in the United States, you can’t just get there, get a code, and get in. In most cases.
After settling in the apartment, we walked through Le Marais. It was quite an experience because you find yourself in a different world, and the contrast back home gives you a buzz…

Yesterday I went across Paris with a driver called Abderrazak. I had to go from Paris Orly airport all the way to Charles de Gaulle on the other side of the city, where the international airport is located and stay overnight before taking our Cathay Pacific flight back to Hong Kong.
My daughters fell asleep after a long day travelling from the Canary Islands, so I started to chat with the stranger in command. I am usually guilty of pulling out my iPhone every time I have a break but this time, I decided to live in the real world, and leave my digital life in my pocket.
I found out Abde was born in Paris to Algerian parents who emigrated from Oran to France for a better life, like many others in the 60’s, once the French occupation of Algeria ended.
Although he feels French and has only been to Algeria on holidays, he said people are not satisfied when he says he is French.
Even though his passport says his place of birth is Roissy (in Paris), his darker look and Arab name raise suspicious eyebrows.

I’m sitting at the Air France Lounge at Charles De Gaulle, pulling down episode two of Studio 60 over the wi-fi so I can watch it on the flight back, and figured I’d do a little blogging while I’m at it. I’ve been in Paris the past two days to do a speech for Disney, which means, of course, that I fly all the way from New York to Paris and then I’m immediately taken to Paris Disneyland, where they’ve put me up in the “New York” hotel. Of all the Baudrillardian ironies…
I’ve done a lot of these two day trips to foreign cities in recent years: Lisbon, Hong Kong, Paris, Hamburg, Amsterdam, London many times. They can be a little exhausting, but I’ve grown fond of the routine. There’s no time to actually try to see anything systematically, no time even to really acclimate to the place. So I basically just try to take a half day and evening, and just walk around with no real destination, letting the natural flow of the city direct me. In cities that I know quite well, like London or Paris, the fun of it is in figuring out the limits of my knowledge, in others it’s more of a process of discovery. And I always try to have some new music that I’ve just downloaded, to listen to on the iPod as a soundtrack. It embeds this lovely — and enduring — connection between the music and the memory of a place…
But enough about all that — SARAH JESSICA PARKER is sitting right next to me in the Lounge!! Does Gawker have a Paris edition?

Book news, reviews and more from an award-winning critic

Over two decades, I’ve reviewed more books about France than any non-English speaking country. So, I suspect, have most critics.
Writers were heading for the cafés and boulevards of Paris more than a century before Snoop Dogg carried the Olympic torch through the streets of the City of Light, and literature is the richer for it.
James Baldwin went there to escape American racism. Ernest Hemingway arrived as a correspondent for the Toronto Daily Star. Edith Wharton first visited the city as child and eventually felt so at home that she spent the last three decades of her life there. She explained the allure of Paris with a line that translates to, “I have it in my blood.”
So many writers have had the same blood disease that the city has inspired good books in a vast number of genres of fiction and nonfiction for adults or children. The abundance could make you say: Mon Dieu!
Where do you start looking for one?
Other critics might urge you to begin with a masterwork. But I never finished Proust’s In Search of Lost Time after…

The Petit Palais in Paris is only a hundred and twenty years old — give or take half a decade. It was built, along with the Grand Palais across the street, for the Exposition Universelle of 1900. Two years later the Petit Palais was designated a museum, and today it is part of the glorious collection of free museums of the City of Paris.
So nobody has ever lived in the palace. But one can dream.
The Petit Palais is on the right bank of the Seine, a pleasant twenty minute walk from my home, and often along the path to or from another destination. It is easy to wander in and out again, particularly if you use the ground floor entrance where there is almost never a line as you pass through security.
Gustave Courbet’s Le Sommeil (The Sleepers, 1866), my favorite erotic painting of all time, is housed in one of the large galleries, along with a number of Courbet’s other nineteenth-century masterpieces. I’ve copped to my fondness for this extraordinary painting in another story.

When I moved to Paris in 2013 one of the first things I did was obtain a Navigo card and after a couple months of buying monthly passes manually via machines I switched to an annual pass and have not had to think about topping up again. The metro was the way I moved about Paris.
But after getting to know the Metro fairly well you realize that it’s often just as easy to walk to a certain location and you start making choices about what form of transportation makes the most sense given the weather, your mood, what you’re carrying, and what else you still need to accomplish. Velib was already around when I arrived in 2013 and the shared bike boom followed by the rise in trottinette usage meant that options for transport have only multiplied since then. The one form of transport that has received an explosive infusion of support from local government is bicycles.
Now that bike lanes are so well-established in Paris, I wonder how so many of us were brave enough to ride with vehicle traffic for many years prior. Cars and their drivers, convinced that everyone but them were simply “intruding” on their entitled space, didn’t make life easy for those of us on bicycles, but we figured that was simply the way it would be. I mean, this wasn’t Amsterdam after all. But little did most of us know that the Dutch model was…

I stepped out on a cold, damp January morning to walk to the nearby supermarket for groceries. When I reached, I realized I had forgotten my phone.
My language handicap gnawing at me as I needed the French-English translation app I was using.
I didn’t speak a word of French, which wasn’t ‘Bonjour’, ‘Merci’ or ‘Au revoir’ back then. I was looking for salt at the supermarket.
It was the start of 2016. I had just moved to Paris. For a couple of months, my husband’s MBA hostel became our abode. He was pursuing his MBA at HEC Paris back then.
And I was tagging along while continuing to do my old job from Paris.
“There is but one Paris and however hard living may be here…the French air clears up the brain and does one good.”- Vincent van Gogh
The HEC campus was brilliant. I got a first-hand insight into the top MBA college experience.
There were parties, partner engagement group activities, gym, and lectures. With time, we found an elite group of friends to hang out with. This brought in the feeling of ‘a home away from home’.

‘You have any idea if I can use this coupon or do I have to put a coin in?’
‘Ma’am I’ve got no idea. I’m just trying to get to the toilet.’
Apple pay worked on the second try, and the turnstile swung open to the sordid men’s room of the Gare du Nord station. I paid and I pissed. I rejoined mum in the queue for the self-operated ticket machine, which we eventually summitted, only to find all 3 out of order. Stranded in the underground of one of Paris’ busiest stations, fearing for our lives, we sought concord by the help desk.
I’d had far from a glowing first impression — I figured I was already starting to buy into the Paris syndrome — the heightened expectations. The inevitable letdown.
I had hardly been won over on the way here. The views from the Eurostar had been, actually, short of spectacular.
‘I’m pretty sure we just popped out the tunnel in France. Looks like England but worse.’
What I didn’t realise, as I complained to my girlfriend about the Merville countryside, was that France doesn’t just look like England. Just like home, France is a parasite. Slums feeding off the prestige of the capital. Like London, Paris is a very rich city attached to an otherwise lacklustre country.
I’d seen and dismissed the outskirts, the prefabs enlivened by graffiti and the…

Paris is one of the most visited cities in the world, but you will enjoy your stay more if you understand the complicated toilet culture. Parisien toilets are almost as diverse as the French cheeses, and the etiquette for using them can be confusing for a first-time visitor. I have taken 20 student groups to Paris, and I always tell my students to use a bathroom when they see one so there are fewer emergency situations.
Let me help you with what you need to know.
In the Louvre. In the main lobby under the stairs there are free bathrooms. The bathroom at the food court costs 50 centimes, and there is a bathroom that claims to be the cleanest in Paris. This bathroom is the most expensive. Obviously, you should use the free bathroom, but it helps you to know what to expect from the other two.
In the Luxembourg gardens. There are free bathrooms in the front to the left, at the back, and in the middle near the tennis court. It is expected for you to leave a small tip at the counter. I usually leave 20–50 centimes.
Public street bathrooms. There are public bathrooms on the street that look like spaceships. You will need change. They self-clean in between use, so wait for the green light.
In Cafés. If you need to use the bathroom in a café, you should buy something. You usually don’t need to pay in a café. Sometimes the owner will give you a jeton to use as a coin.
Although they are a rarity now, you might find a type of bathroom called Napoleon. It is two feet separated by a hole. When you flush make sure to step away from the feet because the water will wash over the feet.
I hope these suggestions help you to understand the bathroom culture.

Paris may be known as the city of love, but it’s also a city known for its fashion, if Emily in Paris has anything to say about it. As one of the “Big Four” fashion weeks (alongside New York, Milan, and London), Paris has cemented its legacy as the epicenter of haute couture and ready-to-wear collections.
Paris Fashion Week is an event that kickstarts trends off the runways and into retail stores and wardrobes globally. Here’s what you should know about it:
Paris Fashion Week wasn’t always as famous as it is now. Back in 1973, the French Fashion Federation established it as an official event to showcase the country’s unparalleled sartorial talent. But you’d be surprised to know that Paris’s love affair with high fashion goes back a long way.
In the 17th century, Louis XIV, also known as the Sun King, played an influential role in elevating France’s reputation for luxury fashion. The monarchy’s patronage of the textile industries and ateliers established Paris as a global destination for style and sophistication.
By the 19th century, the arrival of Charles Frederick Worth (considered to be the father of haute couture) solidified France’s dominance when it came to fashion. His maison became a pilgrimage site for royalty and aristocracy. It also ended up laying the groundwork for Parisian fashion houses that are revered today — including Chanel and Dior. French fashion dresses became the trend, stemming from the fact that France became known for its quality, style, and elegance.
Paris Fashion Week might be synonymous with sophistication, but its real value lies in its diversity. It’s where avant-garde designers share the stage with heritage brands, creating a rich tapestry of styles and narratives. The event has two objectives: to present haute couture and ready-to-wear styles that speak to elites and everyday fashion enthusiasts, but also to set the tone for trends in the coming year.
Haute couture, which Paris exclusively champions, is an art form in itself. Each piece is generally handcrafted, taking hundreds of hours in craftsmanship alone. Designers like Christian Dior redefine feminine forms and designs, while other designers challenge history and society’s rules for what fashion should be. In the ready-to-wear segment, Paris outshines many other fashionable cities, due to designers pushing boundaries while maintaining elegance and structure in their clothing.
Paris Fashion Week’s influence on global trends is unparalleled. Each season, designers debut collections that reflect cultural shifts, technological advancements, and environmental consciousness. From the rising popularity of gender-neutral fashion and artisanal clothing to the integration of sustainable practices, Paris runways are a microcosm of broader societal ideals.
Think about the past Paris Fashion Weeks — there was a time when fashion was all about the classic silhouette. But during Fashion Weeks in the 2010s, this notion was dispelled. Designers like Maria Grazia Chiuri and Virginie Viard breathed new life into traditional forms, blending history with modernity while retaining sophistication. Paris Fashion Week is also an event where it is consistently proved that fashion isn’t just about wearable clothing — it’s also about conceptual art.
Many people believe that Paris Fashion Week is only about showcasing French designers, but that’s not the case at all. It’s a global platform that celebrates talent from around the world. Many designers see it as an award of sorts because it is the ultimate stage to attain recognition. This is also a stage for established brands to reaffirm their status and gain brand retention among their customer base.
The event also acts as a launchpad for emerging designers. Initiatives like the ANDAM Fashion Award spotlight fresh talent. It gives budding designers the opportunity to present their work to an audience of industry leaders, buyers, and journalists. These platforms are monumental in shaping the next generation of fashion, making sure that Paris will forever remain at the forefront of innovation.
In the past few years, especially after COVID-19, technology has transformed the way many experience Paris Fashion Week. Live-streamed shows, virtual reality experiences, and social media have democratized access, allowing millions to view this event while it’s occurring. Social media platforms have become integral to the event, with influencers and brands using them to amplify their audience reach.
But despite its long legacy and renown, Paris Fashion Week is not a stranger to challenges. From rising calls for sustainability to accessibility, there are many areas where progress is being made. The rise of digital fashion — virtual garments and NFTs — poses both a challenge and an opportunity. Paris Fashion Week has begun to explore these frontiers, as well as others, in an effort to remain relevant even during changing times.
Considering Paris Fashion Week’s history, it’s clear how important it has become in the fashion world. It’s not just that it’s a legacy event; it’s an event that sets standards for fashion everywhere in the world. It’s a cultural phenomenon that dictates how we perceive and engage with fashion, even on a daily basis. The colors, styles, and fits that are all the rage today were on the runways at some point in time, showing just how influential this event is.

Helping You Adapt to Life in France

I’ve lived in France on and off since 2014. I’m often asked, “How did you do it?” The short answer is a lot of determination and a refusal to take non as an answer. But, I know a lot of our TAIP readers hope to live in France permanently one day (or are already here and want to know how to stay), so I want to share, step-by-step, my own journey to France and how I made it all work.
Let’s get right into it.
I never imagined I’d ever study abroad, never mind live abroad. One day, when I was still in Rhode Island completing my undergrad, a friend of mine had to pick up some paperwork from the study abroad office. We had plans after so I decided to tag along. While I waited for her, an advisor approached me and asked if I was interested in learning more about my options. I shrugged and said, “Why not?” (if you’ve been in France a while, you’ll also find that this is a very frequently used idiom that indicates French willingness to try something new…another topic for another article) and joined him in his office.
I was studying fashion merchandising at the time, so after taking a look at my transcript he told me that my best options would be Milan or Paris. Was I interested in leaving for an entire semester? (no). Okay, how about the J-term in between the fall and spring semesters? (maybe…). He started pulling out pamphlets and I absentmindedly leafed through them.
At the time, I had a steady job at a local boutique and a long-term boyfriend. I thought all of that was way too important to leave, even for just a few months. But, as the advisor continued to sell me on my options (do these people get a commission on sign-ups or something?) I slowly started to warm up to the idea. He asked me again, “Milan or Paris?” Without really thinking about it I said Paris — I’d seen movies, read books, heard about the French capital. I knew what it looked like at least, as compared to knowing nothing about Milan — a few taps on his keyboard as he took a closer look at my transcript and he told me that if I wanted to graduate on time, a full semester was my best bet. “What do you think?”
Again, without really thinking about it I said, “Okay. How do I sign up?”
I didn’t even have a passport at the time and thoughts of my job and boyfriend fluttered through my mind; to be honest, even to this day I don’t know what made me say yes. Unlike some expats, I never had a lifelong dream of living in Paris, and yet, something urged me to do that semester abroad back in 2012.
I ended up having the best six months of my life, completely fell in love with the city, French culture, the food… I’m sure half of my readership knows exactly what I mean. A group of four of us even ended up staying for an extra month down in Cannes because none of us were ready to leave. Alas, I did have to go back to the US to finish my undergrad, and that I did. Dreams of living in France full-time slowly but surely disappeared as I slipped right back into my former life. I graduated, got promoted at the boutique, and moved into a new apartment with my best friend. Life was “good,” though I couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right.
In the winter of 2013 I was still working at the boutique and was, to be frank, miserable. So what do miserable people do when they’re bored at work? They scroll through Facebook, naturally. A message popped up — it was from a girl whom I studied abroad with who had never left after our semester. She decided to stay to be an au pair with a Franco-American family because she wasn’t ready to go back to the US.
We were just chatting, catching up, when my curiosity got the best of me. “How were you able to stay?” I asked. Was it difficult? I can’t stop thinking about Paris myself…
She filled me a bit and then told me that in fact, she planned on leaving her au pair position in May of next year. She loved the family (and had been with them since June 2012. It was November 2013 at this point) and was helping them find her replacement. She ultimately wanted it to go to someone she knew — she really cared about the kids — was I interested? I hesitated. Maybe. I told her I’d think about it.
Life got busy with the upcoming holiday season and I soon forgot about the conversation. Fast-forward to March 2014 and my friend messaged me again. Did I have time to think about coming back to France as an au pair? The family still hadn’t found a replacement. Like most young women my age, I had plenty of babysitting experience and I even nannied for a few summers when I was a student.
Just like that fateful moment in the study abroad office a year and a half earlier, without really thinking about it, I said, “Okay. What’s next?”
While I’m the first to admit that I stayed in my English-speaking-au-pair bubble for longer than I maybe should have, living and working in France was much different than studying abroad. I had to navigate French culture much more often (I was living with a French person and French children, after all), and learning how to adapt was difficult at times.
I was often homesick after the first six months and the initial excitement wore off — I also struggled to find a core group of friends. But, I did adapt, grow, learn, and eventually, thrive. My years as an au pair were some of my favorite that I spent in Paris and when I did find my people I felt like I truly belonged.
The caveat(s)? I still couldn’t speak French, my au pair contract was running out, I knew I didn’t want to work in fashion anymore, and I also knew I wasn’t ready to go back to my life in Rhode Island.
I had to figure out a way to stay.
Well, I did figure it out, but that story will have to wait until Part 2.

Okay, let me start by saying that the title of this post is sort of a joke. I am going to talk about a commemorative souvenir token that people who lived through the 1870–1871 Siege of Paris could buy, but the “all I got” part isn’t at all how most of them would have thought of it.
As France continued to lose the Franco-Prussian War and the month of September, 1870, progressed, Parisians (and visitors to Paris) realized that the Prussian army would soon surround the city. In a short time, Paris would be cut off from the rest of the world and besieged. And so, many residents and visitors left the city as quickly as they could. An understandable decision, of course, and one that many of them were probably grateful for, since those who stayed in Paris experienced hunger, extreme cold, disgusting bread and other food choices, and even a month of heavy bombardment by the Prussians for those who lived on the Left (South) bank of the Seine.
That said, it wasn’t always easy for those who fled the city, either. In addition to sometimes being separated from family members and friends, they also often hadn’t packed what was really necessary. For instance, a letter in Paris’s Musée de la Poste (Postal Museum) that was delivered by pigeon post includes a complaint about not having brought warm enough clothes. This was probably because most Parisians thought the Siege, which started on September 19, 1870, would only last a month or two, if that. And then there was the fact that no one could have predicted that the winter of 1870–1871 would be one of the coldest in recorded history.
Still, the Parisians and foreigners who stayed behind in the city had a great deal of pride that they saw the Siege through, especially when they compared themselves to those Parisians in the upper class or government who had evacuated.
The Siege of Paris had its humorous side. Satirical cartoons were a huge thing during that time, not to mention funny songs. But there was also an overwhelming, often excessive sense of patriotism. Read even a few accounts of the Siege and you’ll easily find a number of examples. One of the most interesting ones I’ve come across recently was recorded by Francisque de Biotière in his memoir Paris dans les caves, épisode du siège 1870–71 (Paris in the Basements, an Episode of the 1870–1871 Siege). He writes about how mothers would teach their babies to blow a kiss when someone said “Pour les Français ! ” (“For the French!”) and to make a fist when someone said Pour les Prussiens ! (“For the Prussians!”).
This was actually one of the more light-hearted manifestations of patriotism during the Siege. You can see the other extreme in things like the arrest of General Ambert, whose “crime” was yelling “Vive la France!” during a battle, instead of “Vive la République!” What was probably just a slip in the midst of a life-threatening situation was perceived by many Parisians as a sign of dissension towards the the newly created Third Republic, which had been proclaimed on September 4.
Even those Parisians who didn’t become fervently patriotic often felt a sense of pride for having endured the Siege. While I don’t understand the hysterical patriotism, I do understand that latter feeling. And after all, we still make and buy souvenirs today that commemorate things like surviving a hurricane and its aftermath or, on a lighter note, getting through a particularly difficult sport-related challenge or hike…or pub crawl.
The 1871 answer to this was a commemorative coin, called a jeton de présence (token of presence). I was surprised and delighted to discover that there are at least two contemporary descriptions of the tokens in newspapers — one in Le Monde Illustré, and another from the Moniteur du Puy de Dôme, a newspaper from a region very far from Paris.
The French Ministère des Armées’ Chemins de Mémoire blog includes a direct quote from the Moniteur du Puy de Dôme (my English translation follows):
On a frappé à Paris une médaille commémorative du siège, uniquement destinée aux personnes qui n’ont pas quitté la capitale au moment du danger. Elle est en bronze, sur l’une des faces se trouve un groupe symbolique représentant Paris repoussant l’étranger, sur l’autre on lit : République française, jeton de présence. Un espace libre permet à chaque citoyen d’y faire inscrire son nom.”
Frappé par la Monnaie de Paris en argent et en cuivre, ce jeton pouvait être acquis par les civils ou militaires qui avaient été présents lors du siège.
(In Paris, a commemorative medal of the Siege has been struck, solely intended for those people who didn’t leave the capital during this dangerous time. The medal is made of bronze, on one of is faces is a symbolic group of figures representing Paris fending off the foreign threat, on the other [face] one can read: French Republic, token of presence. There is a blank space [below this] where each citizen [who’s purchased a token] can have his or her name engraved.
Struck by the Paris [National] Mint in silver and in copper, this token can be acquired by civilians or military personnel who were present during the Siege.)
Le Monde Illustré’s mention of the token is sort of like a companion piece to this. It’s an advertisement, and shows, among other things, that the token was available in other materials as well: white metal (I’m assuming this would be a cheap alloy that looked like silver) and imitation gold, in addition to silver and bronze. There’s no mention here of a copper option, so maybe the two reddish-gold metals were used interchangeably by the writer of the Moniteur du Puy de Dôme article.
Interestingly, the ad for the jeton was published on January 21, 1871 — a week before the Siege ended. Although most Parisians knew the end of the Siege was inevitable at that point, it’s interesting that some were already producing commemorative souvenirs. There is a sense of opportunism, but maybe it was also a sort of consolation — “At least we got through it,” or “France may have lost, but we Parisians were tough and held out as long as we could.”
In all of my research on the Siege of Paris and its aftermath, I don’t think I’ve ever heard about jetons de présence — or if I have, I guess it didn’t stick with me. They are legit, though; even the Musée Carnavalet, Paris’s delightful history museum, has one in its permanent collection.
And then, one day, I came upon some present-day ads for jetons de présence, on Le Bon Coin. A very popular site in France today, Le Bon Coin is sort of like Facebook Marketplace, where you can find anything — including some really interesting antiques. In fact, it’s where I found my beloved Siege of Paris bread souvenir.
From time to time, I’ll head over there and do a search for “Siège de Paris 1870” and see what comes up. In late February, a few jetons de présence were among the results.
Although they aren’t the most iconic Siege souvenir (at least, not for me — that honor definitely goes to bread souvenirs), the significance of them, that sense of pride that they’re so closely associated with, and that universal idea of wanting to commemorate something we’ve been through, really stuck with me. The more I thought about it, the more I wanted to buy one.* One day, a new jeton de présence ad appeared. Unlike most jetons I’ve seen, this one actually had a name engraved on the back, and, rarer still, it was a woman’s name: Blanche La Jousse.
I loved this connection to a real person, and something about the fact that she was a woman made it even more moving to me. I thought of Claire, one of the main characters of my novel Hearts at Dawn.
But whether or not the name had been that of a man or a woman, the fact that someone had purchased this token and then taken on the additional trouble and expense of having it engraved is a powerful sign to me of how much their experience mattered to them and how much they didn’t want it to be forgotten.
…Although a part of me wonders if it was a misguided gift that had been given to them by someone else. Maybe Blanche La Jousse just wanted to move on from the Siege, and didn’t care about having an engraved coin to commemorate the experience. It’s one of those things we’ll never know.
Jetons de présence are often bought and sold by coin collectors, and in fact, when I reached out to the person who was selling this one**, he told me that he dabbled in coin collecting and had bought it at the Marché aux Puces de Saint-Ouen (a huge antiques and flea market just outside Paris) a decade or so ago. He didn’t know much about the Siege of Paris but had been attracted to the coin for the image on the front.
It’s a compelling one: (Likely) on the wall that then surrounded Paris, an allegorical personification of Paris is defending the city with a spear she’s holding out in one hand. In the other, she holds a flag. She’s surrounded by soldiers. There’s impressive detail in their uniforms; we can see the typical uniform of a member of the Garde National, but also the sailor-like uniform some artilleryman/gunners wore. Many of these men were recruited from the navy. We can also see barrels and other materials that reinforced the National Guards’ posts along the city wall. You can spot many of these in photos like this one. Despite all of these details, though, the face of the Paris figure isn’t sharply defined.
Beneath the group, we have the words “SIÈGE DE PARIS” and the year 1870 in Roman numerals.
The back of the token is far less elaborate, with RÉPUBLIQUE FRANÇAISE written around the top rim, in a curved box with a five-pointed star at the outside of each end. The bottom of the token has the same sort of curved box along the rim, but nothing is written in it. At the top center of the token’s back are the words “JETON DE PRÉSENCE”, followed by a small decorative symbol. The rest of the jeton’s back would have been left intentionally blank, and many jetons de présence you find today remain so, but here we see that as was intended, Blanche La Jousse had her name engraved in the blank space.
I like the back of the jeton best, since it has this unique, human touch.
I didn’t expect to learn more about Blanche La Jousse, but when I received the coin, my husband, who’s an experienced genealogy researcher in his spare time, suddenly had an idea. He called me over to his computer. To my astonishment, he’d found a record of her burial in Paris’s Cimetière du Montparnasse. You can see the two full pages of the ledger here. Blanche La Jousse’s name is the seventh on the list. Here’s a closeup of the line with information about Blanche:
The cemetery’s records gave us some insights into Blanche’s life. She died in 1917 at the age of 75, meaning she was 28 at the time of the Siege. I was amazed that this made her only a few years older than Claire in Hearts at Dawn. Not that this is the most important thing, of course. Still, it was a moving coincidence.
According to the records, Blanche lived in Paris’s 7th arrondissement (7th Ward). We don’t know where she was born, or if she ever lived in other places or even other arrondissements, but this means that at the very least, she was living in Paris during the Siege and was back in the city (which was once again undergoing a war and bombing), at the end of her life in 1917. Maybe she was a lifelong Parisian. If she wasn’t, I hope she was happy about returning here.
It’s doubtful that she’s still in the burial plot listed for her, since Parisian cemeteries tend to remove people’s remains to a charnel house after a certain number of years. But there are exceptions — for instance, family mausoleums or people whose descendants continue to pay for the plot. Whatever the case, we plan to go to the cemetery one of these days and see if we can find her gravesite.
I wish I knew more about Blanche La Jousse than this. I hope she likes being mentioned here, and thought about. I know that, like everyone who stayed in Paris during the Siege, she had a difficult four months. I hope she didn’t suffer too much. I hope she liked her jeton de présence and carried it with pride or kept it in a place of pride. The fact that it wasn’t found at the Marché aux Puces till recently makes me wonder if it was kept by her descendants for a few generations. That’s something I’ll never know, either.
But I hope she thinks it’s funny that her jeton left Paris with a collector and now is back in the city, with a family who wonders about her from time to time and admires her for getting through one of the hardest times in Paris’s history.
~~~
*If you’d like to get a jeton de présence of your own, you can find them for sale on various coin collector websites, as well as on eBay. Most jetons de présence, engraved with a name or not, tend to be sold for around 25–35 euros (about 27 to 28 US dollars).
**Special thanks to the man who sold the jeton to me and answered my questions about where he got it. The photos he took of the jeton de présence are the ones I’ve used in this post, since my phone’s camera just could not get that level of definition. I would have asked if he wanted to be credited by name, but once I told him that my husband and I were going to look for Blanche’s grave, he stopped responding to my messages — I think he thought that was creepy.

The view of Paris from Montmartre is one of the most breathtaking sights in the city — a sea of slate rooftops and white buildings, scattered with recognizable landmarks, green spaces and other details like islands among its waves.
But how long has it looked like this?
Last weekend, a friend from the US was standing with me at the top of Montmartre. “What was the view like when Van Gogh was here?” he asked. “Was it mostly fields?”
I told him that it wasn’t — Paris has been a fairly large city for centuries and by the 1880’s, when Vincent Van Gogh was living in Montmartre, it was a huge sprawl of buildings, factories, avenues, the Seine, and several large parks. The view of Paris from Montmartre’s heights would at that time have been roughly the same as it is today.
As someone who loves Paris deeply, and has for most of her life, the appearance of the city during my favorite era of its history seems like a given. But I started to wonder what visual proof might exist to show someone that the view from Montmartre has remained roughly the same — not only from the time Vincent Van Gogh was living there, but also from the time of the 1870–1871 Siege of Paris, sixteen years earlier.
My search for answers has taken me on quite the journey these past few days, revisiting beloved images and discovering or re-examining others. Although I’m left with a few lingering questions, I hope that I’ve been able to put together a good collection of visuals that show what the view from various sides of the Butte (hill) Montmartre was like in the 1880’s and in 1870 and 1871.
The view of central Paris from Montmartre in the 1880’s
Let’s start with the 1880’s, since that was the era my friend asked about.
Vincent Van Gogh lived in Montmartre from 1886 to 1887 or 1888, fifteen years after the end of Hearts at Dawn (otherwise, I would have given my favorite artist a cameo in my book!). From what I’ve read in biographies on him, as well as in his published letters, Vincent — as he preferred to be called — found Paris inspiring, but also overstimulating and overwhelming. And it wasn’t always easy sharing the life of his brother and sister-in-law, whose apartment he was staying in.
Still, Vincent painted a number of canvases during his time here, including a few views of Paris. My favorite of these is Vue des toits de Paris (View of Paris Rooftops), painted in March or April, 1887 (a sketch version also exists).
I love that we know exactly where this canvas was painted: from the window of Vincent’s room at his brother’s apartment, on the 3rd floor of 54 rue Lepic. This building still stands today, and whenever I’m in Montmartre, I stop by to look at it and marvel that Vincent once walked here on his way home.
The apartment is privately owned, so unfortunately you can’t go inside, but apparently some scholars have been allowed to. One of them shared in a blog post that the view from Vincent’s old window has, sadly, changed, with new buildings blocking the glimpse of Paris that he immortalized (you can see the current view from the window here).
Another of Vincent’s paintings from this time is usually given the similar title The Roofs of Paris. This time, we get an unobstructed view of central Paris, looking south from the summit of Montmartre.
Even today, this view from the southern side of Montmartre is the most famous one, since it offers an immense vista of the city below. As you can see in this cropped version of the photo at the beginning of this blog post, which I took from the summit of Montmartre last weekend, barring some additions like the occasional skyscraper, the Paris cityscape has remained more or less the same.
Vincent’s painting is of course an artistic interpretation — like many who’ve painted and sketched this breathtaking sight, he seems to emphasize recognizable monuments like Notre-Dame and the Panthéon, when in reality they probably looked at least a little smaller because they were far away. But I think it shows something about that excitement of being able to spot them and recognize them — like seeing friends in a crowd.
I also think the way he seems to have brought the city closer than it would have actually appeared could be a sign of that connection with others that he always sought. Or maybe it’s just his artist’s eye, knowing the precise way to frame the image and emphasize what’s needed.
Here’s another photo I took from the summit of Montmartre, looking slightly westward, cropped as closely as I can get it to Vincent’s painting:
Here’s the same image, with Notre-Dame and the Panthéon, the two most recognizable landmarks in Vincent’s painting circled:
As we can see, in the 1880’s, Paris was already a large, dense city. But this blog focuses on Paris during the Siege, in 1870–1871, so you might be wondering what was the view from Montmartre was like then.
The view of central Paris from Montmartre in 1870–1871
Between the 1870’s and 1880’s, some parts of the world experienced immense growth. For instance, my friend is from Colorado and I could imagine a frontier town changing a lot in those ten years. But in 1870, Paris looked pretty much the same as it did in the mid- to late 1880’s.
Of the things that had changed about the landscape, most would have been hard to spot from this towering vantage point, where so much is lost in that sea of slate roofs and white facades.
But one sure constant is that Paris was already a built-up city, especially in its central areas, and had been for decades.
For instance, in this 1862 caricature by Daumier of the famous pioneering photographer Gaspard Félix Tournachon, who went by Nadar (and who had recently invented aerial photography), we can see that the Parisian landscape below his balloon is packed with buildings, nearly to the horizon.
This is a caricature, of course, not necessarily a realistic depiction, but Paris had to be recognizable for it to work, so we can imagine that this is a fairly accurate impression of how the city looked from a high vantage point.
And in fact, here’s something that always amazes me: Some of Nadar’s aerial photographs, among the earliest in existence, still survive today. Here’s a view he captured of a part of western Paris. As you can see, certain sites are helpfully labeled…including a portion of the Butte Montmartre itself!
The photo is from 1858, four years before Daumier’s caricature. Yet even then, we can see a city that certainly has its green spaces (including the Parc Monceau, which plays an important role in Hearts at Dawn), but it’s very much already an urban landscape. And this isn’t even the heart of the city.
Another way to understand what Paris looked like in the 1870’s and ‘80’s is to look at maps.
Wikimedia Commons has a really cool collection of public domain maps of Paris throughout its history.
One of these maps, entitled “Le Paris de Napoleon III”, gives us an excellent overview of Paris in 1870.
At a glance, we can see one major difference compared to the Paris of today: the wall around the city. Known as the Thiers Wall (l’enceinte de Thiers), it was demolished in the 1920’s and ‘30’s. That said, as far as I can tell, there was no portion of the wall that would have been visible from Montmartre’s southern slope’s view onto the rest of the city, so it wouldn’t have influenced the famous view from the south side of the Butte.
Another difference that may be a bit more difficult to spot at first, especially if your computer is having trouble zooming in on the map, like mine was, is that the city is a bit less built up in certain areas, especially around most of its perimeter. That would probably give an overall impression of more greenery or space at the edges of the landscape than you’d see today.
Unfortunately, while we have drawings, paintings, and aerial views of Paris at this time, I don’t know of any photographs taken specifically from the summit of Montmartre with the intention of showing the view from its southern slope in the 1880’s or during the Siege of Paris. A big reason for this might be that photographic processes at that time couldn’t show distant landscapes in great detail.
But we’re lucky to have at least a few photos that were taken of people and a certain specific object on Montmartre in 1870 and 1871 that happen to give us at least a notion of the view from its slopes and summit.
This is due to the fact that Montmartre played an important role in the Siege and the Paris Commune (March 18-May 28, 1871), in two particularly notable ways:
1. It was the site of several balloon launches. Balloons are an iconic feature of the Siege of Paris, since they were the only (relatively) reliable means for Parisians to send messages to people outside the city walls — in fact, airmail was invented during and because of the Siege of Paris. Two of the balloon launches from Montmartre are especially notable: that of the Neptune, the first balloon launched during the Siege, and that of the Armand Barbès, which took Léon Gambetta out of Paris so that he could conduct government business and rally French troops on the other side of enemy lines.
Here’s a photograph by Nadar himself, showing the Neptune being prepared for flight, in the Place Saint-Pierre, the square at the base of the Butte’s south side.
2. It was the location of a large canon depot (parc d’artillerie). Many of these canons had been funded by donations from Parisians to fight the Prussians. On March 18, 1871 (about a month and a half after the end of the Siege), the French government’s attempt to seize the cannons to hand them over to the Prussians as part of the terms of the treaty that ended the Franco-Prussian War was the event that ignited the Paris Commune, a period of civil war between the French government and the rebel Communards (most of them armed thanks to that same government, which had encouraged them to volunteer for the Garde Nationale during the Siege).
When I was researching Hearts at Dawn, I came across several photos and images of the canons on Montmartre. But I have to admit, while I know that they were stored on the southern side and possibly summit of the Butte, I haven’t been able to find out exactly where the depot was or its extent. Some sources make it seem as though it was on the summit of Montmartre — for instance, this very detailed sketch shows Saint-Pierre de Montmartre, the church that’s been on the butte’s summit for centuries before the construction of the Sacré-Cœur, just beside the cannon.
But others, like this photograph, suggest it also extended down along the slopes.
While researching this blog post, I also learned that the parc d’artillerie was where the cannons were stored, but they were then rolled to areas called batteries — outcroppings with good vantage points — where they were aimed and readied for firing.
I came upon this sketch by Gustave Doré, entitled Batteries sur les buttes Montmartre and dated March 6, 1871. In the sketch, we can see several spots where cannons were placed along the southern side of the hill.
As a point of reference, here’s roughly the same view today:
Back to the first two of these three historical images — what’s most important, for the purpose of this blog post, is what we can see in the background of each. In the background of photo of the parc d’artillerie, a dense mass of buildings makes up even this relatively small portion of the view towards Paris.
The sketch of the parc d’artillerie also suggests that immensity. Today, the dome of Les Invalides and the (then-new) Palais Garnier opera house are still easy to spot and loom fairly large among the rest of the cityscape. But I can’t vouch for the Arc de Triomphe being so noticeable, as I’ve never seen it from Montmartre’s heights. Like nearby monument The Eiffel Tower (which was constructed in 1889 and thus wouldn’t have been visible in the 1870’s or to Vincent when he was in Montmartre), it’s located in the western part of the city, a view that’s largely blocked by trees and buildings on and around Montmartre today.
You can see the Eiffel Tower, though, if you move a bit past the funiculaire. And according to this blog page, you can make out the Arc from the top of the dome of the Sacré-Cœur.
If you follow the link, you’ll see that the Arc de Triomphe is still pretty hard to spot, which makes me wonder if the artist of our sketch was just trying to emphasize it to give a reference point, or whether it might have been more noticeable because that area, while still pretty built up, as we could see in Nadar’s 1858 aerial photo, didn’t have quite as many tall buildings around it as it does today?
Where could you see the view from Montmartre in the 1870’s and 1880’s?
Speaking of vantage points, it would have been impossible to climb to the top of the Sacré-Cœur in 1870 or 1871, since its construction (started in 1875) wasn’t complete until the early 20th century. But the photographer and the draughtsman of our parc d’artillerie images are looking down on the summit, likely from the Tour Solférino, an observation tower that used to sit on the summit of the Butte. The tower’s two upper floors were demolished so as to be less of a potential target for Prussians during the Siege, and in 1874 it was demolished entirely.
You can see the lower portions of the Tour Solférino, as well get a general idea of what Montmartre’s summit looked like where the Sacré-Cœur now sits, in this painting from 1870. In it, Parisians are looking out over the city from what appears to be a makeshift observation platform. Note that while this artist wasn’t as focused on the details of the cityscape below, his use of grays and whites still suggests its size and density.
You can also get a very good overall impression of what the summit of Montmartre looked like in 1871 from Gustave Doré’s sketch of the batteries: The middle of the summit is a vacant space, with the church of Saint-Pierre on the left, and the Tour Solférino and some other structures on the right. In the center, we can see the tops of distant buildings set a bit further back on the heights of the Butte.
(Possibly) A view of western Paris from Montmartre in 1871
On the other hand, I have to confess that this photo of canons on Montmartre
is less easy to understand. The cityscape in the background doesn’t seem to be central Paris, since there are no noticeable landmarks and it looks more spacious and green. In the right corner is what seems to be a tree-lined avenue. There are no factory smokestacks, probably ruling out eastern Paris, as well as the landscape to the north of the city (a little more on those further on). I believe the batterie in this photograph may have been facing western Paris, but I can’t be absolutely sure.
Even though there are some very precise sources, like this webpage giving detailed information like where canons were kept in Paris and how many were at each site, nothing that I can find specifies how many batteries were on the slopes of Montmartre, or just how far around the hill they went.
(Probably) Views of eastern Paris from Montmartre in 1871
Fortunately, we have more precise information for these next images.
These photos date to the Commune (March 18 -May 28, 1871), and seem to show the same barricade on the Butte Montmartre (barricades were common in many streets of Paris during this time), taken at what appear to be slightly different times and angles.
The first is labeled as being on the rue de la Bonne:
while the second is labeled as being located at the intersection of the rue de la Bonne and the rue du Chevalier-de-la-Barre (then known as the rue des Rosiers, not to be confused with the rue des Rosiers in the Marais).
From what I can guess, the barricade could have been located near the intersection, in the present-day square Marcel-Bleustein-Blanchet, which overlooks northeastern Paris. But it’s also possible that it was at the actual intersection of these streets that we see on a map today; since the Sacré-Cœur wasn’t built yet, it might have been possible to get a relatively uninterrupted view of the city beyond, which would be impossible now. But since the Communards seem to be standing near the edge of the hill, my first guess seems more likely.
In both photos, the view of Paris is unfortunately a bit hard to make out in terms of details, but we can see a cityscape stretching out far to the horizon.
On the other hand, the location of the barricade and the fact that we can make out factory smokestacks and numerous green spaces make me even more convinced that this is a view from the eastern, not southern, slope of the Butte, which means this is a view of northeastern, not central, Paris.
This area was less developed and dense than the center, and many factories as well as parks like the fairly recently created Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, were located here. Even today, while eastern Paris is certainly more built up than it was in 1870–1871, many areas are still a bit more open than the center of the city.
The Butte Montmartre in the 1870’s and 1880’s
Montmartre is an iconic Parisian neighborhood today but for Parisians in 1870, it had only recently been incorporated into the City of Light, when the city officially added all or parts of surrounding villages to its borders in 1860. Before that, Montmartre was a village known for its windmills, taverns and guinguettes (beer gardens). After it became a part of Paris, this reputation was still upheld. It also was a pretty inexpensive place to live. With its cheap rents and unconventional attitude, artists began to flock to Montmartre’s slopes. Over the following decades, these included Vincent Van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, Picasso, Modigliani, and many others.
In the 1870’s and ‘80’s, some parts of Montmartre were somewhat built up. For instance, the building Theo Van Gogh (and, for that short time, Vincent) lived in looks like a perfectly normal 19th-century Parisian apartment building. (That said, Montmartre has never totally followed the rules — as its streets were being paved, many often caved in, due to the Butte itself being full of hollow spaces where plaster of Paris had been mined in previous centuries.) But just around the corner, dirt roads, shacks, and wooden dwellings cobbled together by amateur (albeit talented) builders were the norm.
This area roughly between the rue Lepic and the rue Caulaincourt was known as le maquis. The picaresque slum’s origins date to around the 1870’s or ‘80’s. Despite health and sanitation issues, including no running water or building safety standards, le maquis existed to some degree until as late as the 1940’s. You can see some fascinating photos of the maquis through the years here. Keep in mind that most, if not all, of these photos date to later than the Siege and Commune of Paris.
So, if you were looking at Montmartre itself in the 1870’s, you would see a hill dotted with structures like buildings and windmills, but also plenty of undeveloped areas, including a good portion of its summit. By the time Vincent Van Gogh was there, in the mid- to late 1880’s, the maquis would have been more noticeable, and the Sacré-Cœur would be under construction at the summit.
The view north of Montmartre in the 1870’s and ‘80’s
The northern side of Montmartre looks out over a little bit of the city but mostly beyond it, into the northern suburbs. In the 1870’s and ‘80’s, that view would look more like what my friend was expecting. Villages and towns to the north of the city had fields between them, as opposed to the relentless urban sprawl that you see today.
When researching this blog post, I was excited to come upon this 1874 sketch by Eugène Delâtre, which shows the view from the rue du Mont Cenis, a long road that runs down the Butte’s northern slope. In the distance, we can see factories and villages, but also some green spaces.
This is the most radically different view from the Butte Montmartre. Here’s how it looks today — a vast urban sprawl:
A view out of time
Back to our most famous vista: central Paris, seen from the south side of the Butte Montmartre.
Because some areas of Paris were less developed than they are today, the overall landscape in the 1870’s and 1880’s might look slightly less dense, something that most of the visual sources here seem to confirm.
But overall, as we can see from the images I’ve shared here, as well as what we can tell from sources like maps, guidebooks, contemporary novels, correspondance, and travelers’ accounts, Paris in the 1870’s an d’80’s looked, on a whole, very similar to Paris today, especially in the central parts of the city. The same can’t be said for the view from Montmartre’s northern side; today, the scattered albeit big towns have given way to a vast urban sprawl.
Of course, in the 1870’s and ‘80’s, there weren’t skyscrapers, the Centre Pompidou, or the Eiffel Tower (well, not until 1889) — all of which you can see from Montmartre today.
Another thing to consider is that what I’ve described here are the typical views you’d see on a typical day from the top of Montmartre. But I imagine there must have been times when observers in 1870 and 1871 could see some sign of the forts that surrounded the city firing, or some trace of battles in the northern suburbs. During the semaine sanglante (Bloody Week), in late May 1871, when the Communards were burning down landmarks and government buildings around the city, people could surely see clouds of smoke if they were looking down from the Butte. And I imagine its summit would have been an amazing place to observe the aurora borealis that appeared in the sky on October 24, 1870.
But despite all of this, while it certainly wasn’t exactly the same, the general view from Montmartre in 1870–1871 and in the 1880’s wasn’t dramatically different from what we see today. The city was still dense, especially its center, and you can still spot recognizable monuments like the Palais Garnier, Notre-Dame, and the dome of Les Invalides.
This similarity is one of the things that, to me, makes the spectacular view of Paris from Montmartre even more moving. When I look out at Paris from Montmartre, I am seeing the scope of a city of countless stories. I am seeing nearly the entirety of this enormous place that I love. And I am sharing that view with people from the past. Someone in 1870, a year I wrote about and studied and have grown to love, would see almost the same thing as I do now. For a moment, it’s like we’re standing together, suspended in time.

Paris. It is the heart of France. With fashion, gastronomy, arts, and architecture; here lies some of the most unique shopping, sculptures, and structures in the world.
When I first arrived in this beautiful city, I had no idea what to do with myself. There was so much to see, and only having two days booked here, I couldn’t imagine where to begin. Getting some advice, I realized I had to adapt to the local way of life alongside my sightseeing. Here, stopping for un Verre de Vin (glass of wine) is acceptable whenever you need a break. People-watching is a common sport as you relax on one of the many beautiful café terraces, and the people here give off such a relaxed vibe that you have to learn to just go with the flow.
So, I began my discovery of Paris in one of the most famous locations of the city Le Tour d’Eiffel. The Eiffel Tower. I decided I wanted to make the most of this part of my trip, so I went in the afternoon and stayed for the sunset. After entering the plaza, and getting my ticket, I chose to take my time and use the staircase to the top. There is an elevator option, but I thought back to some advice I had been given. Relax, take your time, and go with the flow. So, I took plenty of breaks on my ascent and enjoyed the views over the river Seine. When I finally reached the top, the sun was setting and I had the most majestic view. Standing there, watching the city slowly light up the night, was such a magical experience, I was left speechless. I truly thought there was nothing in the city to top this moment.
Well, was I wrong. After coming back down the tower, I saw a tour boat bobbing along the river Seine, and decided to jump aboard. Now, the view from the top of the Eiffel Tower was impressive and a unique way to see the city. But seeing the Tower herself, up close, and bright as a shining star at the end of the river, there are no words to describe this perfect scene.
I awoke the next morning eager to continue exploring. I walked from the Notre Dame, all the way up to the arc de Triomphe, visiting sights along the way. The metro runs all along this path, but again, meandering through the city seemed to be the best way to experience all Paris had to offer. On the way, I saw the Sainte Chapelle, Palais Royal, the Louvre, Orangerie, and the Place de la Concorde. My second day was filled with so much scenery, sightseeing, and shopping, I was exhausted. Finishing the evening watching a show at the Moulin Rouge before heading home to pack was such an entertainingly perfect way to finish my day, I knew I would jump at the chance to come back to this beautiful city.

How can Paris be the worst at anything? It is so beautiful. It is so historic. It has everything! All of that is true, but it is the worst to drive around. I drove over 6,700 miles across Europe, so I feel I have some experience in the matter.
Driving on the “other side” in the UK took some getting used to, but after a few days, it wasn’t so bad. Prague was a challenge because of all the trams that use the same roads as cars and all the cobblestone streets. Florence was tough because of the narrow one-way alleys. But Paris is on another level.
Sometimes there are dividing lines in the road, sometimes not. Sometimes other drivers abide by those lines, sometimes not. There are all sorts of twists and turns and one-way streets. There are underground tunnels with limited signage. There are cyclists and mopeds and motorcycles (and pedestrians!) weaving through traffic. Then, of course, there are crazy, multi-lane roundabouts like around the Arc de Triumphe.
I don’t think I would have been prepared to drive in Paris if it was our first stop. It was only because I had practice in other European cities (Rome, Madrid, Berlin, etc.) that I was able to make it through unscathed.

When I travel my main mission is to visit places in Paris that are not tourist traps. I want to experience a city like a local vs going to places frequented by and designed for tourists — one, because the quality may not be the same and two, you are most likely going to pay more for subpar quality. I, of course, will see any of the major attractions that are on my list to see, but as far as my dining and exploring go, would rather go to gastronomic musts and places off the beaten path, or at least the touristic beaten path. Also, coming from NYC I’m used to a certain level of service, as well as a certain type of charm. Living here for almost three years, I’ve discovered many gems. If you want to discover those gems, this guide is for you.

If you are visiting Paris, I suggest you stay central, or in the center circle of the arrondissement map above (basically arrondissements 1–9). Most likely you will want to hit some of the tourist attractions, and, if so, you want to be centrally located. I may be biased here, but I think the best place to stay is Saint Germain on the left bank. It’s just more picturesque and not as congested as the right bank, which is definitely more touristy. If you want to feel like a true Parisian and can secure a hotel or airbnb in the 6th or the 7th arrondissement, that is your best bet. If you prefer the hustle and bustle of Paris, I would do the 1st or the 8th for a more upscale feel or the 3rd or 4th for a more artsy vibe.
Pro-Tip: Renting an apartment in Paris is the best way to get the whole vibe of the city and is pretty cost effective compared to NYC. Also, the space will be bigger. Most Parisian hotel rooms are tiny, so if you don’t require all the creature comforts of a hotel, an apartment is truly the way to go!
Super Pro-Tip: For more affordable lodging and a less congested atmosphere, you can also stay along the borders of the hot neighborhoods, i.e. the 15th in the part bordering the 7th, or the 17th in the part bordering the 8th or the 11th in the part bordering the 3rd and the 4th.
So, you are in Paris, one of the culinary capitals of the world. One cardinal rule to remember, you seriously cannot get any bad food here. It is nearly impossible unless you go to somewhere on my avoiding list . And the lovely thing about Paris is you can eat anywhere based on your budget type and get a pretty solid meal. Here are my top three by category.
Traditional Paris Brasserie popular with the media types located in Saint Germain
What to get: Duck Confit, Baba au Rhum, Bottle of Chateauneuf du Pape
The brasserie where Keanu Reeves and Diane Keaton eat in one of my movie faves, “Something’s Gotta Give”
What to get: The hot foie gras, beef bernaise, bottle of the Gevry Chambertin
Where all the old artists like Hemingway, Cézanne and Wilde used to frequent. There are many seating options including an outside or indoor garden, main brasserie and piano bar
What to get: A gin or vodka martini to start, the foie gras, the lamb, crepes suzette flambé, any bottle of red
One of the best tasting menus I’ve had in my life and the priciest, but totally worth it. You can either do a land/sea tasting menu or a veggie tasting menu. Both are equally delectable. Alain Passard is a genius and usually visits each table during the dinner seatings. You can eat downstairs in the cave, which is more intimate (I did find out that this is where they usually seat the tourists, but it’s better IMHO). You can also request to sit upstairs if you want to be seated with the locals.
Amazing Japanese French Fusion Tasting Menu and one of the better tasting menus I have had in Paris. Space is small and minimalist, but food is amazing. There are 3 tiers-discovery standard and luxe. We did the luxe bc I really wanted the truffles but it was honestly too much food, for me at least!
One of the trendier tasting menus here in Paris so make sure to make your resis months out in advance. If you can’t snag a ressie for your stay, Frenchie Bar à vin is across the street from the main restaurant. They don’t take reservations, so make sure to show up a few minutes or half an hour before they open to snag a table. They serve AMAZING wine and tapas style dishes for dinner. If you happen to be just wandering in that neighborhood, Frenchie to go (another part of their family) is great for lunch and sandwiches to go.
Pro-Tip: Have the sommelier choose your wine when you do a tasting menu as they do know best. And, always do the wine pairing if that option is available.
Located down a side street where the 6th meets the 7th, this brasserie is charming and serves up some of the best southwestern French food you will eat in your life. All ingredients are locally sourced and the cheese and wine come from local shops from a few blocks away.
What to get: Foie gras (toast the bread with your private toaster), the duck confit or cassoulet and the cheese plate. Wash it down with some pinot noir or another red of your choosing.
Way down the beaten path in the heart of the 15th, this little restaurant is not one to miss. With a prix fixe menu that changes almost daily, you really are in for a treat. You get to choose a starter, main course and dessert for the small price of 39€ that is a steal since the food is Michelin Grade!
What to get: Menu changes daily, but get the foie gras for your starter if they have it as it is homemade. They also have bottles of the moment, which are usually treasures.
This restaurant is where French people go to dine and treat themselves. Comprised of a slew of great young talented chefs it is hard to go wrong. You can opt for their normal prix fixe set at 39€, or go all out with their 5 course tasting menu for 59€, both a steal for gastronomical dining!
What to get: Menu changes so if you do the normal prix fixe menu where you have a choice just ask for their reccommendations.
If you are hankering for a flavor of the Mediterranean, head over to Balagan. Vibe is trendy and fun and the cuisine is light yet filling.
What to get: Anything with zatar and the snickers dessert. Their international wine selection is a top on my list!
Craving Italian? For a nice cozy feel, head over to Cherche Midi on the street of the same name. Spot is a cute little neighborhood spot where mostly locals go. The food is pretty amazing and you won’t be sorry.
What to get: The lobster ravioli if they have it or any of their pasta/seafood dishes.
Japanese Fusion hot spot in the heart of Saint Germain. They don’t take reservations, so make sure to go either at the beginning of dinner service or towards the end of primetime dinner. If you are here in August, you will have no issue as most of the Parisians are on holiday.
What to get: The cocktails and a few small dishes to share.
So in Paris, you have two options — you drink wine like the french do (and seriously it’s a crime not to) or you drink cocktails. I like doing both. You can find and drink good wine anywhere, seriously, ANYWHERE — a cafe, a brasserie, even McDonalds, so I hear. But if you want to go to a true wine bar or have a real cocktail, read on.
For those of you who are truly french beginners — this is basically a bar for natural wines. Even though I am not a big bio wine fan, I don’t discriminate as they have pretty good wines here, as well as good vintages. They also have a location in NYC
This is a great lively joint in the 9th arrondissement. Love this place because you can either sit in a main bar, but if you prefer a more intimate setting you can book one of the underground caves and enjoy your wine and nibbles in there.
This is more of a brasserie, than a wine bar, BUT they make my list because they have a cellar of 250+ wines. The best is you can even buy a few bottles to take home.
Pro-Tip: If you are not looking for a full out wine experience you are best served going to a brasserie for apero hour, where the french enjoy a few nibbles (charcuterie and cheese plates, or as they call it “planche mixte”) with their apertif of choice.
Love, love , love the Ritz because it has as many bar options a girl can dream of! If you are going for a speakeasy vibe, you must try Hemingway Bar. Regardless of what you are looking for, you must try Hemingway Bar — their bartender is a legend in his field and the cocktails made there cannot be found anywhere else, including the other bars at the Ritz Paris. They also have two outdoor bars, which are lovely on a nice day or evening or a tea room where you can enjoy a proper tea and champagne.
If you are looking for somewhere off the beaten path and a night of surprises, head over to the Marais to this gem. Cocktails are curated in a special artist’s book that would make a nice addition to your coffee table collection. The vibe is fun and lively.
Wanting to hang in the left bank? Then head here for fantastic cocktails, a great vibe and amazing beats. They also make one of best sazeracs I have ever had.
Pro-Tip: If you really cannot live without a true cocktail, make sure NEVER, EVER, under any circumstances order a cocktail at a brasserie unless you want to be majorly disappointed. Always order your cocktail at a hotel bar, a cocktail club or one of the brasseries on this approved list.
If you are coming during the first of the month and the Louvre is on your list, entry is free the evening of the first Saturday of the month. Saying that, you can still purchase tickets for the VIP section so you don’t have to wait on the super long line. I personally find the Louvre overwhelming and find a guided tour better able to manage my visit — you can still wander around on your own after the guided tour if you wish. This two hour one is my favorite, and as an extra bonus you get to skip the line!
If you really have no interest in going to the top of the tower, and you just want to see it, head over to the steps of Trocadero, which is the best spot to see her majesty. If you do go in, enjoy a glass of champagne at the top or just book reservations at one of the restaurants to avoid the line completely.
Best time to go here is when it is a sunny day with no bad weather or the balcony/tower areas will be closed off. It’s also better and safer to wander the winding and steep streets of montmarte when it’s not raining or snowing.
You can actually climb to the top of the Arc if you just don’t want to be just another one of those tourists trying to get the perfect shot from the Champs de Elysée. I will warn you that this climb is not for the weak of heart — there are no elevators, the staircases are beyond narrow and the air quality leaves much to be desired.
Pro-Tip: If you happen to be touring Paris with a young one in a stroller, you are in luck. You can get to the front of any museum or tourist attraction line. I have often thought about buying a stroller and putting a baby doll in it just for this perk.
Totally innovative for Paris, this is definitely a must see. Imagine seeing works of art projected in a loft like space with music playing in the background. Book tickets way in advance especially if you are looking for Saturday/Sunday tickets, as this is when the French go with their families.
Pro-Tip: Book Friday evening tickets as they have a bar open during these hours
If you happen to be in Paris during Opera and ballet season, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing tickets to a performance.
Pro-Tip: For a more elegant feel and a true Opera experience, make sure to book at Palais Garnier. If you want more of a casual vibe, head over to Opera Bastille.
Taking a daytrip out of Paris is an easy thing to do whether you decide to go by train, car or uber. If you want to go north, take a train and check out the beaches of Normandy. If you want palaces and to see how the royals lived, head over to Versailles. Want to explore your artistic side? Head over to Giverny and get a little taste of Monet. Looking to get your drink on? The Champagne region is your best bet. The possibilities are endless.
Pro-Tip: If you are going somewhere not too far, totally worth it to check uber pricing. Sometimes it makes more sense than taking the train and is less stressful.
Versailles Pro-Tips: If you do Versailles, highly recommend doing a horseback excursion through the gardens before actually touring the Trianon and the Palace. It truly is an unforgettable experience. If you choose only to do the Palace, I would do the guided tour route like the Louvre, as it is massive!
Being one of the fashion capitols of the world, Paris is definitely somewhere to spend those dollars especially since you get your VAT back, which depending on the purchase, can add up to a lot. You can read more about shopping here.
One of my favorite things about Paris is shopping the Farmer’s Markets. The produce and quality of food here in France is superior to the US mostly anywhere, but there is something special about the farmer’s markets. It is more fresh because they make that morning drive with the produce for one and it feels great to support the local markets and smaller businesses.
Marche de Avenue Saxe (Thurs & Sat)
Bio Market Avenue Raspail (Sunday)
A trip to Paris is not complete without visiting a fromagerie. Even if you are staying at a hotel, you must visit a local fromagerie and do a sampling of cheeses. Love the cheese here vs. US because it is unpasteurized and the variety and the special types they make here are simply second to none.
Quatrehomme
Marie-Anne Cantin
Pro-Tip: You can also ask them to vacuum pack your faves for transport to the US. FYI-this is illegal and I’ve never done it, but if you want to try your luck with customs as many do, by all means, go for it!
To feel like a true Parisian just sit at a café in the afternoon or morning and just take in the beauty around you. If you are here for creative purposes, it is sometimes a nice treat.
Chai de l’Abbaye
La Varenne
Pro-Tip: At cafes, you can sit anywhere that is available. You do not need to be wait to be seated. If you do, it will tell them right away that you are a tourist! And if you don’t know French, no problem! Here’s a little cheatsheet that will help you get around.
Another great thing to do is just chill in the park. The lovely thing about Paris is that you can pretty much set up shop in any of the green spaces. The other great thing is there are no close rivals to the type of picnic assortments you can create here — foie gras, saucisson, fromage, wine, champagne…Create your own adventure and curate your basket to the nines!
Invalides
Saint Germain de Laye (outside of paris but def worth the uber ride)
Pro-Tip: Bring the wine. If you didn’t know, drinking outside is legal here, bien sûr!
Paris is truly one of the most beautiful cities in the world and true Parisians walk aimlessly everywhere. Sometimes it is nice to get just get lost wandering the side streets in Saint Germain and the Marais. My best discoveries in Paris have been made by accident! Best time to walk is in the morning before the sun gets too strong and in the evening after dinner to burn off all the calories you just consumed!
So, there you have it — your Parisian visit at your fingertips. Obviously, I have a long, long list of favorites, but we’d be here for hours if I published that! For the full list, click here and put “Paris list” in the additional info field. Until next time, happy exploring!

Thoughts, tips and tricks from an American living in Paris for a year.
When we first moved to Paris, I did a few posts about all the stuff we went through to move here. I thought it would be interesting or helpful to people thinking about doing something similar.
Before writing about our experiences again, I wanted to give it some time to sink in and really be able to reflect back on what we’ve been through and what I think about it. Well, as we’re sadly just about to leave, it’s probably about time. Here are some final thoughts on being a French family for the last 11 months or so.
I want to start this off by saying that this has been a truly amazing year.
I’m going to go into some negative stuff (as well as some positive stuff) because those things are interesting to me, but overall I’ve loved our stay in Paris. The neighbors and friends we’ve made have been just amazing. The French people we’ve met have been some of the nicest and most welcoming I’ve ever known. The tech community here has been nothing but kind to me and excited that I’m here. My daughter sings little songs in French to herself when she thinks we’re not listening and it’s adorable. My French has gone from absolutely zero to being able to understand and say a fair amount. I know Paris, one of the most amazing and beautiful cities in the world, pretty well now. It’s been one of the greatest years of my life, for so many reasons. I couldn’t possibly recommend trying it more.
Now, on to the fun stuff.
By far the hardest thing about moving to France has been being an immigrant. You are in a new place and you don’t know anybody nor do you know the language, customs or habits of life. Not only is that difficult on you, since new things can be stressful — you’re rarely comfortable outside your house since nothing is familiar — but the real hard thing is that it can feel like almost nobody really wants you here.
From the perspective of the average person you have to interact with, you’re hard to communicate with, you’re probably a little stressed out and you’re frustrated at stuff. If you’re a cab driver or bank teller or waiter, I’m sure you would prefer to have a customer who speaks your language instead of someone you have to gesture to. As an immigrant, you’re highly aware of this and it’s embarrassing. Don’t get me wrong, most of the people we’ve interacted with in Paris have been exceedingly kind and helpful, but as the person constantly putting people a little more out of their way than normal, you’re aware of it.
The people who are not kind nor helpful, however, is the government of the place you just moved to. I assume this is true everywhere — I can’t imagine that the immigration offices of the United States are shining beacons of comfort and inclusion — but it’s certainly true of France.
Within 3 months of landing in the country, you are required to get a residency stamp to validate your long stay visa. This requires you to send in paperwork, get an appointment and go in for a health check. The main issue is that in Paris it takes about 3 months to get your appointment after sending the paperwork in, which means if you don’t do it immediately upon landing there is likely to be some period of immigration awkwardness if you try to leave the country. The rules and procedures are incredibly confusing and only exist on their website in French. If you call them up, they will only speak to you in French. When you get there, all of the instructions and literature are only available in French. Only one of the 8 people I had to interact with on my appointment day could (or would) speak any English to me. Calling the customer service line to try to make sure I was doing things correctly ended in abject failure. (“Vous parlez anglais?” “No” “Umm, OK... [click]”). Remember that this is the immigration office.
The problem for us was that they messed up the appointments and accidentally sent me two appointments for Scott and none for my wife Jessica. So since I couldn’t clarify the issue due to language barriers, we showed up with just the one paper assuming the appointment was for us both. Although her appointment was in fact scheduled for that day, since we didn’t have the appointment paper for her (because they never sent it), she was sent away. This means she had a period of months where she had no valid visa because we had to reschedule the appointment from scratch using only horribly Google-translated emails to their department. This means she couldn’t leave the country during that time because it was likely she would not be allowed to re-enter.
The appointment itself was also humbling and embarrassing. You have to sit in a series of rooms with nobody explaining anything in English and people get visibly frustrated with you when you don’t do what they’re apparently asking you to in rapid French. There is a chest x-ray you have to do where you are shuffled into a private room, asked to undress from the waist up, sit there without your clothes on for a while, then walk half naked into another room with two people in it to take your x-ray, then back again to re-dress. My wife was not super happy about that part.
Now, very interestingly to me, this is not what happens when you are sponsored on a work visa. I’m on a long stay visitor visa since GitHub didn’t at the time have an office in France. Some American friends we met through my kid’s school had none of this experience because his company handled everything for them. No x-ray, no immigration office shenanigans, no OFII humiliation that you don’t speak the local language perfectly yet. Even though technically I’m probably the perfect immigrant — someone who is paid from a US company and just spends all his money here — I felt like a dirty shitty immigrant who was being barely tolerated, probably only allowed to stay here due to a technicality.
My experience in the grand scheme of things was not that bad. Compared to almost every other immigration experience, we probably had it near the easiest. It was really just uncomfortable and embarrassing. It just subtly made me feel that I was not wanted here during a confusing process. However, I happen to personally have the means to leave at any time — I can’t even imagine what it must be like to have to go through all of this when you have few other options. To be immigrating because you have to immigrate. I’ve always had sympathy for immigrants to the US, but from now on I’ll have a bit more empathy as well. It is not easy, even when it’s relatively easy.
Speaking of the importance of learning French if you want to move to France for a bit, it might be of interest how I’ve gotten along in learning another language at the ripe old age of 35.
I have tried just about every possible language learning method there is over the last year, most of them for months at a time. I had a 100 day streak on DuoLingo at one point, doing about 30–60 minutes a day. I listened to nearly 4 full seasons of Coffee Break French, which is probably hundreds of hours of audio content. I took about a month of in-person courses (3 hours a day, 3 days a week) at Alliance Française, a globally renowned French language learning school. I had about 30 hours of (expensive) in-person private tutoring with a local French tutor. I took about 20 hours of private Skype lessons through tutors found on iTalki. Plus, I lived in Paris — going to restaurants, buying groceries, getting haircuts, reading the Metro newspaper, etc.
Here is what I have learned. If you want to learn a new language, there is exactly one method to do so quickly and efficiently — private Skype tutoring.
In my opinion, DuoLingo (or any of it’s automated brethren such as Rosetta Stone, Babbel, LiveMocha, etc) is almost totally useless in a practical sense, at least by itself. It may help you to read a bit, you may get some vocabulary to sink in, but it’s not a natural way to learn language and most of it goes in one eye and out the other (or something like that). Months of it will not help you to actually hear the words when spoken by a native speaker, and you will certainly have no practical ability to produce the language.
The Coffee Break French podcast is excellent for understanding real-life spoken French, but obviously not helpful for producing understandable spoken French. It also unnecessarily gets a bit into the weeds on grammar points. If you want the biggest bang out of it, just listen to the dialogue episodes over and over again.
In-person classes, even at prestigious (and expensive) schools like Alliance Française, are helpful but slow. You rarely actually speak to the teacher in a way where you’re corrected. Most of your dialog is with fellow students who are probably worse at the target language than you are. Plus it’s incredibly expensive in time and money.
The absolute best and fastest way to learn a language in a way where you can land in a country and both understand and speak it effectively is one on one tutoring with a native speaker. The cheapest and most efficient way to do that is with Skype. With Skype (or online video chat in general), you have no commute time, no awkward in-person formalities, you can continue classes even when you travel, you are constantly speaking and are being personally and helpfully corrected, and there is a chat window so the tutor can type out stuff they’re saying or you can type answers (which is really helpful in French where stuff doesn’t always sound the same as it’s written). You can get professional language teachers for as little as $10/hour in some languages. That means that for $200, you can take an hour lesson 5 times a week, every day of a month. That plus an hour of homework a day will get you really, really far in even one month. Probably farther than 3 months of an expensive group class. Certainly farther than a year of DuoLingo or Rosetta Stone.
I found great teachers on iTalki, but there is also Lingoda and LiveLingua which look promising. They all have free trial classes, which is a great way to get over the weirdness you might feel in doing an online private class like this. Benny, the guy who runs the great Fluent in 3 Months blog, who has learned a number of languages to fluency, came to essentially the same conclusion. He reviews the iTalki website here, which is a great read.
I’m testing out my theory over the next few months. While I’m still doing French lessons and want to continue to improve, I’m cutting way back on them and am going to start over from scratch with Japanese. GitHub has started really expanding into Japan and I would love to be able to speak some Japanese the next time I go there.
So, I’ve signed up for classes on LiveLingua and am planning on taking them for 1 hour a day, 5 days a week for the next 3 months to see how far I get, starting at the end of July. My hypothesis is that I’ll be better at spoken Japanese by November than I am in spoken French now, even after a year of fairly regular study and living in France. It will cost me about $1500 total for those 3 months of study, but if I’m right it will be way cheaper and way less of my time than getting to the same language proficiency through any other method.
Look for my follow-up post in November.
Finally, I thought it would be nice to share some of the random things we’ve learned about living in Paris. About every month or so someone lets me know they’re visiting Paris and asks for advice on where to eat or what to do and I write a slightly different email every time. I figured it would be good to summarize the stuff I liked doing and the places I liked eating at the most so the next time you’re visiting you can take advantage if you want.
We’ve eaten at dozens of restaurants in Paris since we’ve moved here. Everything from a 3-star Michelin place (L’Epicure at Le Bristol) to the great family run restaurant down the street. I’ll give you my 3 favorite places in a bit, but first I’ll give you the resource I used to find all 3 of them. Teach a man to fish and whatnot.
The Paris by Mouth blog has been the most amazing resource for dining and drinking in Paris by far. It lists great places by arrondisment and I don’t think there is a single place I’ve been to off that list that wasn’t really great. It also has great lists of wine bars and haute cuisine places. If in doubt, just check this list to find amazing places close to you.
Sometimes it’s hard to find a place off that list — many are closed on Sundays, most of them require reservations at least a day in advance, which means calling them and trying to speak in French occasionally, some of them can’t take large parties, etc. My fallback on these occasions is the Yelp of Paris, La Fourchette. You can search by group size and times they are open and make reservations online. You can also rank by rating and pretty much everything I’ve booked via this site has been really good as well.
There you have it. Now, just for fun, I’ll share some of my personal favorite places to eat in Paris.
The first is Les Papilles. It’s a wine store and small restaurant near the Luxembourg gardens that is my favorite place to take visiting guests. They have no menu, they just bring you a few courses of great French food and you choose a bottle of wine off the wall.
It’s charming and delicious and fun, I adore this place.
The next is Verjus, in the 1st arrondissement, near the Louvre. It’s more upscale and expensive, but not ridiculous. The food is amazing and it has an adorable wine bar downstairs.
The last is a place called Aux Anysetiers du Roy on the Ile St. Louis (a few blocks from the Notre Dame on the smaller island). The clientele is almost exclusively touristy, but we love it. The cassoulet is my favorite and the bathroom upstairs is amazing. I’m not kidding, you have to go to the bathroom when you go here.
I’ll also throw in Dans les Landes, a tapas place in the 5th. I had a frustrating experience with one really rude waitress there once where she didn’t want to seat me because I didn’t speak French, but everyone else there has been great and the food is great (and pretty different).
Of course, food in France is great, but when you visit Paris you really want to have some great wine, right? Well, fortunately there are some great wine bars here, but unfortunately French wine can be really confusing, especially to Americans.
In America, wines are generally labeled by varietal, the name of the grape. So you would generally know that you like a Chardonnay or a Pinot Noir or a Cabernet Sauvignon. In France you will almost never see the name of a grape on a bottle of wine. Instead everything is labeled by “appellation” or region. Each of these regions has rules about what they can grow and how, so if you know you like a Pinot Noir, you have to know that that grape is normally (and almost exclusively) grown in Burgandy, so you have to look for a Burgundy red wine. Of course, it doesn’t generally say “Burgundy” on the label either, so you have to know that “Mercurey” is a region in Burgundy and look for that.
I knew absolutely nothing about wine when I moved to Paris and in my time here I’ve become somewhat obsessed with it. I’ve taken a series of increasingly serious wine classes resulting in just having completed the WSET Level III advanced certification in Wines and Spirits and contemplating enrolling in the Level IV Diploma classes (more on this adventure in another post).
However, you don’t need to do that to appreciate and enjoy French wine. What I would suggest is to take a basic tasting class though. You’ll learn a ton, you’ll drink good wine and you’ll have fun. If you think Bordeaux is a grape, take a wine class here.
I highly recommend the Tour de France wine tasting at the O Chateau wine bar in the 1st. It’s fun, it’s in English, the wines are great, you learn a lot about French wine and they assume you’re an absolute beginner. It’s also a beautiful spot.
I’ve taken a couple of groups of friends and family here and it’s always been super fun.
As you get better at wine, they also have a huge by the glass selection and serve down to 3cl portions so you can taste a bunch of different wines relatively cheaply.
If you’re into tasting different wines, my other recommendation is Wine Touch. It’s a little place by the Pompidou centre in the 4th that gives you a smart card and a glass and you walk around and self-serve from a bunch of machines filled with French wines, grouped by region. At the end you pay for whatever you poured. It’s a fun way to taste several different wines without being intimidated by a server, if that’s not your thing.
Finally, my favorite place to buy wine is a small place on Ile St. Louis run by a slightly crazy Frenchman who deals only in organic and bio wines at L’Etiquette on 10 Rue Jean du Bellay. Everything I’ve bought there has been really good, but that may just be because I really like bio wines.
I shared a number of tips and tricks useful for living in Paris as an American family in a previous post. These were things we learned a few months in, like getting a French bank account or SIM cards for our phones. Well, in the next 8 months we learned a few more things that might be helpful.
The first is getting health care. If you get sick in Paris it can be difficult and intimidating to go to a doctor. They’re not easy to find, they don’t work long hours and they often don’t speak English well (or at least the other people in their office don’t, making appointments quite difficult). Our expat health care had a directory, but we only ever went once. It wasn’t real bad, but it wasn’t a great experience either, plus it would take a while to get an appointment and it was way across town.
What we ended up using for the majority of our health issues while in Paris was the SOS Doctor service. It’s a 24/7 house call doctor service operating throughout Paris. If you feel sick or need something you can call them at 01 47 07 77 77, the service speaks English and all the doctors speak English, they’ll arrive in an hour or so and it’s something like €40–60 per visit.
Now, for French health care, that’s insanely expensive. France operates off of sort of a universal Medicare system, so all doctors visits are regulated at like €22, I think. For French citizens, most of that is automatically covered by the state as well. However, for most Americans, being totally used to the developed world’s worst possible health care system, paying $50 to see a doctor even with insurance isn’t considered ridiculous — I think typical copays are around $30; if you went to the doctor without insurance it would probably be around $200. So for us, paying €50 for a doctor to come to our home in an hour, any time of the day or night and speak English has been a dream. You could go to the French doctor a 30 minute Metro ride away for free (because expat insurance covers 100% of everything because everything is reasonable here), but when you get the winter gastroenteritis from holding on to the Metro pole like everyone eventually does, you’ll be throwing your €50 at these guys.
Finally, God help you if you need a pharmacy at 1am on any day, there is like 1 of them open in all of Paris. On holidays it’s even worse. My advice is to go through this list the day you arrive, find the 24 hour one closest to you and write down the number and address and make a dry run. If you ever need something in the middle of the night (for your kid or some emergency), call them first to make sure they’re actually open. We had a pretty horrible night of me being really sick and Jess making useless Uber rides to closed pharmacies that said they would be open online. I’m not kidding — the night in question was a holiday Sunday and there were literally probably 3 pharmacies open in the entire city of Paris.
Although the food in Paris is amazing, it is in fact very French. If you’re American you will probably eventually want something else. Living in San Francisco for a long time, this was particularly difficult on us. Mexican food here is very rare and generally pretty bad. Sushi is ubiquitous and almost without exception totally horrible. Imagine mediocre sushi you would get from the local grocery store in nearly every single sushi place in Paris.
For Mexican food, you’ll pretty much only be able to find tacos that are any good. There is Candelaria, which is great not only because they have really good carnitas tacos, but there is a sort of speakeasy in the back that is a hip little bar.
There is also El Nopal, up in the 10th, which has great tacos but no seating, so you have to go there on a nice day. We went there on a cold, rainy day not understanding the situation and it was really sad.
If you want to get some American groceries, you have a couple of options. A lot of stuff will be in the local grocery stores, but some things are pretty hard to find. Salsa, pancake mix, maple syrup, cheddar cheese, popcorn, oatmeal — there are a couple of things that you might want that can be difficult to find.
For these things, Jess and I generally go to a ridiculous store called the Grand Epicerie in the 7th. The Epicerie is insane — it’s like a crazy upscale, even more expensive version of Whole Foods. It has a whole fois gras counter, tons of fresh produce and fish, a huge wine cave downstairs, a really good bakery, an enormous cheese selection and a great little cafe to get a glass of champagne in. It also has an aisle of American foods if you’re looking to get any of that hard to find stuff. The Posted in Paris blog has a few other American groceries in town, though I haven’t been to either.
Speaking of missing American things, after some time you might also be looking to watch American movies or television. A few quick tips for you that took us a bit of time to figure out.
If you want to watch a movie, you’re in luck, because basically every movie that everyone on the planet watches is an American movie. We pretty much have a massive stranglehold over the entire cinema industry. Even though there actually is a French cinema ecosystem, of course made most famous by the blockbuster movie “Taken” (just kidding, though that is a French production company), at least half of the movies playing in France (and almost everywhere else in Europe) are Hollywood movies. The trick to going to the movies in France is to look for the letters “VO” for version originale, or VOstF for Version Originale sous-titrée en Français, meaning that it’s in English and subtitled in French. If you look for that when buying tickets, the movie will be in English. The opposite is VF, meaning it’s dubbed into French.
On the other hand, if you want to watch American television shows, even on services that you paid for in the states and may continue to pay for, such as Netflix or even Apple iTunes, you have a slightly larger issue. This is because everyone is fucking stupid. Everything you try to watch legally has regions and borders and ridiculous rules that somehow apply when you’re living in the US but not when you’re visiting France and vice versa. So, in order to keep watching my Netflix shows I use a program called TunnelBear which routes my internet traffic through a US server. If you’re smart, you’ll just pirate everything so you don’t have to put up with all of this bullshit, but I like buying my content, even though the companies I pay for it make it as difficult as possible to use their shit.
Finally, a few tips on having a kid in Paris. There are actually a ton of really fun things for kids to do in Paris, from great parks and zoos to some really amazing museums. Here are some of my daughter’s favorite things.
In the summer, there is a fun little hidden park/playground right by the Grand Epicerie called Compagnie des Filles de la Charité Saint Vincent de Paul. There are a lot of expats and also French families that go hang out there when it’s sunny. Lots of pickup soccer games and champagne picnics in the sun. It’s a great way to meet other families with kids and for your little one to run around with other kids.
There is also a great playground in the Jardin de Luxumbourg. It costs like €2 to get in, but it’s huge and has a ton of awesome stuff to do.
Right outside of it is a little merry-go round where they give the kids these little sticks and each go-round they can try to skewer a metal ring. I’ve never been so jealous of being too big for a ride.
There is also a cool big pond in the middle of the Jardin de Luxumbourg, right in front of the Senate building, where you can rent little sail boats and push them around with sticks. Some good old fashioned 18th century style children's entertainment.
There is also a pretty great and fairly new zoo at the southeast edge of the city. It has a big park right outside of it that is really great and has a great big playground as well.
As far as museums go, there are a few good kids ones, but they’re mostly in French. If you can’t speak French they’re not quite as fun. Jo likes pretty much everything in the Jardin des Plantes, which includes a small zoo, the Grande Galerie de l’Évolution and the rather ridiculous Galeries d’Anatomie comparée et de Paléontologie, which is basically a museum designed 100 years ago and frozen in time.
If you go there, make sure to head on over to the Cafe De La Grande Mosquée and have a tea. You can just sit down in the courtyard and a guy walks around with sweet tea for like €2 each. If you want, you can take a walk around the inside of the Grande Mosquée as well, it’s really beautiful.
Finally, if you want to go to the Louvre and you have a kid, my advice would be to get a copy of “Discover the Louvre” at the gift shop for them. There’s a bunch of cool little games and things for them to look for, it gives them stuff to do as you walk around.
One of the most difficult things to figure out for us was babysitters. There are a few babysitting sites (in French) if you want to go through a bunch of profiles and hire someone randomly, but Jessica and I weren’t super happy with that. In the end we went the more expensive option of using a referral site called Complete Paris. It was a one time €50 fee and they sent us resumes and we picked someone who ended up being really great. I really wish we had done this earlier, because the €50 wasn’t very much compared to the number of times we’ve used her to watch Jo. Since then, Jess and I have actually been able to go out on dates and whatnot.
If you’re still with me after this entire post, then you’re a champ and you deserve something special. I have two snippets of fun insider Parisian information for you.
First of all, I’ll tell you about the best free view in Paris. There are no lines, it’s free, it’s a beautiful view and you can have a glass of wine while you’re there.
It’s the roof deck of the Galeries Lafayette Haussmann, right behind the Opera building. It’s one of the oldest department stores in the world and has an amazing dome inside. Go check out the dome and then go up all the escalators until you get to the very top of the building. There is a big deck with some cafe vendors and a great view. You can see just about everything in Paris from here.
While you’re there, you should probably also pop over to the Opera building, because it’s beautiful and also rarely has a line.
The second special Parisian nugget of information is the secret entrance to the Lourve. It’s not secret so much as just nobody knows about it. On the street in between the Seine river and the south (Denon) wing of the Lourve there is an entrance that is rarely used called the Porte des Lions.
It’s pretty easy to spot because there are two huge green lion statues flanking both sides of the gate. Just walk halfway through the tunnel there and there is a glass door. It always looks like an employee entrance or something, but you can just walk in and buy a ticket. I’ve been through this entrance probably 5 times now and I’ve never seen anyone in line there, even when there are literally hundreds of people in line at the Pyramid entrance.
It’s also pretty easy to beeline it from there to the Mona Lisa and the Venus di Milo, which are both also in the Denon wing.
That’s it for now. I hope this has been helpful if you’re planning on visiting or living in Paris.
We’re actually moving back to the US here in a few days, so this is my last week being a Parisian. Overall, I think this has been a hell of a fun adventure. I didn’t learn as much French as I thought I would, nor did my daughter, but it doesn’t really matter. We had a grand adventure, we got to travel all over Europe, I learned a lot about remote work and I have a vastly different viewpoint on so many things having lived somewhere very different — all of these things helped us grow and made our lives more interesting.
If you’re interested in moving abroad, especially to Paris, let me know. I think it was worth it and I think the world would be a better place if more people were able to do this sort of thing — live in someone else’s world for a short time.

For me Paris is the most beautiful city in the world — the City of Lights, of History, Arts, the city of Culture. No other place offers so much to see and to do as the French capital. Just to start, there are 206 museums, 2,185 historic monuments, many opera houses, theaters everywhere, the best restaurants in the world, charming bars and cafes and luxury shopping like nowhere else. Paris deserves time, and many visits. You can’t do it just once, or in few days.
Which is exactly why so many tourists visit the city — all the time, in great numbers, non-stop. My father, who also loved Paris, once said that Parisians are accused of being rude, but that, in fact, “they are just tired of being visited for centuries”. Indeed.
And right now tourists are coming in greater numbers, despite the terrorist attack of November 2015 and Donald Trump’s declaration that “Paris is out of control, so dangerous’, during his presidential campaign. In 2016 alone, 36,5 million tourists came to Greater Paris, and in the first half of 2017 hotels there received no less than 16 million guests, according to the Paris Visitors Bureau. That is a lot of people! What it means is, if you want to go to any of the major attractions — the Eiffel Tower, the Champs Elysees Avenue, the Louvre Museum or the Marais neighborhood, to name a few — you better be prepared to face crowds of people from every corner of the world: all looks, languages and ages are represented in the streets of Paris. To actually enjoy some of those attractions, you may have to fight your way in.
This is all fresh in my mind. I just came back from Paris after 10 days in the Marais, the charming old part of town that is all the rage now. October is not a particularly high time for tourism — not summer vacation (good luck then!), not a holiday, not the (in)famous Fashion Week, no Christmas or religious holiday, either. Yet, all over the city nervous tour guides holding signs up high, to keep their groups together, disputed with the residents the narrow sidewalks. Crowded? You bet!
And there are newcomers to this scene: the Chinese. Until recently not allowed by their communist government to travel abroad, they are sure making up for it — in 2016 alone, 881.000 Chinese visited the city, and the number keeps growing, again according the Paris Visitors Bureau. Stores are full of them, museums, restaurants, cafes, sidewalks. Never alone, but in groups of 12 or 15 people, they love luxury shopping and buy everything they can, taking many pictures, curious and excited, and clearly enjoying themselves a great deal.
Paris is not only great things, of course. On a sad note, this time I also saw refugees from Syria and other Middle East countries, a problem all of Europe is facing these days, one with no clear solution in sight. Some sleep on the streets, some build shelters wherever they can, a clear challenge to the government of newly inaugurated president Emmanuel Macron. Another concern is the pickpockets in the subway, usually young gypsies who also sing and play instruments in the cars. Once on a ride, I heard a Frenchman near me yell at a kid begging for money: “you should be in school at this hour”. Everyone around seemed to agree.
But even with problems Paris is still amazing — and fun and beautiful, and worth every penny I spend to visit it whenever I can. No other place I know — and I’ve been to many — takes my breath away the way this city does, with its beauty and grace, glamour and class. No matter how many times I see it, it always surprises me.
But this last visit convinced me to be careful with my dates, next time. I will for sure avoid school vacation — July and August — when Parisians travel with their kids but parents from the rest of the world bring theirs. I will stay away from Fashion Week, which in 2018 will happen on Feb 27th — March 6th, when designers from all over come to look for “inspiration”, booking all hotels in the city and causing price surges everywhere.
Come to think of it, I may choose to travel in cold January, when the streets are not crowded and the lines smaller at the museums, something I did once and enjoyed immensely. It’s easy to check the city’s calendar in advance: there is a site in English for that: https://en.parisinfo.com/. I don’t work for them, by the way, but find it very useful and easy to navigate.
No matter what time of year I choose to go, my love affair with Paris will never die, though. In one of my favorite movie scenes ever, the iconic last scene of the movie Casablanca, Rick said to Ilsa: “we’ll always have Paris”.
I thank God for it, and I will keep going back, bien sur.

“…Is to know a great deal.” ~ Henry Miller (controversial author)
Paris is a place of lore. After years of listening to people I love and respect talk endlessly about Paris, we had arrived. Albeit, only for a long weekend. It wasn’t enough time.
It’s not only clients or friends. Paris has been revered throughout history as an artist’s haven.
“An artist has no home in Europe except in Paris.” ~ Friedrich Nietzsche
A divine place of historical significance, beauty and culture.
“A walk about Paris will provide lessons in history, beauty, and in the point of Life.” ~ Thomas Jefferson
And of course, surrealism and the années folles or the golden twenties. The birth of pop culture. The modern development of fashion and style. A melting pot of American influence, tremendous economic growth, film, theatre, and athletics.
Many of my favourite writers and artists have lived in Paris at some point in their career.
“Paris was always worth it and you received return for whatever you brought to it.” ~ Ernest Hemingway
For the novice traveller, Paris comes with quite the résumé.
Dare I say it is the the most over-hyped city I’ve ever travelled to. My feelings are more mixed than history’s. Possibly due to over-saturation and cost of living. Which is saying a lot coming from Vancouver (another high cost of living city). Then again, it could be because I don’t have any Parisian friends to show me around.
It’s the 3rd most visited city in the world, but the average dollar amount spent by tourists is double the top two cities (Bangkok/London). $301/day USD compared to $153–173.
It’s extremely expensive, and shockingly packed with tourist destinations.
You can’t walk more than a few hundred meters without tripping over the next museum or historical landmark. Seriously I can throw a rock from the Louvre to Saint Chapelle.
We saw the outside of pretty much everything on day one. Then we were left wishing we had planned some skip the line excursions. Getting ready to leave and Oktoberfest were so busy we forgot to plan things that weren’t accommodation. Even in October, it was crowded with tourists!
Yes, I understand the irony of that statement, being that I’m a tourist. No matter how I may like to pretend I’m not, or try to experience places as locals do. I remain an ignorant tourist.
I can only wonder how @#%@ing crazy Paris is in the summertime.
Paris, has a population of ~2.3 million. The majority of the city is composed of five story walk-ups. Making it the most densely populated metropolis in a developed country and it’s geographically tiny!
Vancouver is tiny, at only 115 km². We build towers exceeding thirty stories and have a population of only 600k. San Francisco, another tiny city, is 121 km² and 800k people. I’m amazed by the density of Paris without the need for many tall buildings.
Paris is a mere 105 km² with triple or quadruple the people. That means it’s chaotic. Very walkable, with an somewhat outdated and packed metro system. At least it covers a great deal of the city and they post hilarious signs in it.
And my personal Fav…
Are misunderstood. I had full on expectations of being forced to stumble through my poor French. While the person I’m attempting to communicate with snickers behind my back about it.
You hear stories. Few of them true.
The service doesn’t suck, it’s just not Americanized. It’s supposed to be felt and not seen. They are not coming to check on you every 5 minutes. They are not coming by to crack jokes and entertain you for tips. They want you to enjoy your meal or coffee or whatever. When you’re done, ask for the cheque s’il vous plaît and you’re off.
I kind of like it. I’m not fond of being waited on.
People are not rude. But you should keep an eye on your stuff and your wallet when travelling on packed transit. As you should in any major city.
People are fashionable. I should have brought a scarf. A concern Jenny and I both have about travelling to Europe, is only obvious in Paris so far. Not that I’m fashionable to begin with. I have for the better part of twelve years worked in shorts, a sweat-wicking shirt and maybe a track suit of sorts.
There is a pervasive feeling in any country about the largest city. Canadians outside of Toronto like to hate on it. The French outside of Paris also seem to hate on Paris. I get the feeling Parisians are in love with their city.
There is an air of smugness. I feel the same way about Vancouver. The French tend to think that Parisians never shut up about Paris when they leave it. Everything is better in Paris! I don’t feel this way about Toronto but I know some who do.
I’m choked I missed the Catacombs. Things were so crazy before we left and at Oktoberfest we forgot to book any tours.
The only non-negotiable thing for me was the Louvre. I’ve had a fascination with Leonardo Da Vinci since I was a kid and seeing the Mona Lisa was a top priority.
It’s true that no matter where you stand in the room, it feels like she’s staring just at you. A special technique Da Vinci used. Of course the world’s most famous painting is so famous due to the mystery surrounding it.
There are many other famous works in the Louvre like Venus De Milo, Winged Victory, The Coronation of Napoleon, Dying Slave and Liberty Leading Leading the People. Michelangelo. Delacroix. Who cares? I’m all about Da Vinci right now. 😜
We crushed a few kilometers of walking every day. I thoroughly enjoyed taking it all in. You could have a great weekend without going into a single tourist venue.
We stayed near the Eiffel tower. Had a bottle of wine on the grass during one of the hourly light shows. Roamed through a beautiful market. Rolled down Champs-Élysées past the Arc de Triomphe and the Louvre.
I know French food is amazing but we cooked in our tiny AirBnB more often than not. Who can resist French cheese and charcuterie?
After a costly Oktoberfest, we’re attempting to be a little more budget conscious here. It seems more likely we’ll be back to Paris than Munich anyway.
I’m just going to say it. If you like red wine, it’s the best in France. End of story. I’m convinced they don’t ship any of the good stuff to Canada.
Oh and don’t forget about the street art and a surprising coincidence. An Alphonse Mucha exhibit was on when we were there! One of the few pieces of art we own is a print of Zodiac. I’m a much bigger Mucha fan leaving Paris.
That’s our world-wind tour of Paris. It isn’t my favourite city yet but I can see the charm and appeal. We’ll be back for the catacombs.
It was the weekend so neither of us worked which was nice, Bordeaux will be different. Back to work...🤘

Some cities you simply visit, while others visit you. Paris is one of the latter. It doesn’t just stay in your memory; it returns through people, through unexpected messages years later. As if it still cares.
— Grandma, Paris is so beautiful!
I’ve been there several times, and each time it felt as if the city was waking up from a dream just for me. The Seine’s embankment was bathed in bright sunlight, boats gliding across the water, and the streets filled with women showcasing that elusive French chic — something indescribable that makes their outfits unforgettable.
I sang La Marseillaise in a taxi, much to the bewilderment of the driver, and my cheerful mood helped me meet new people.
One day, not knowing French, I walked into a café and decided to greet the waitress with a phrase from Moulin Rouge:
— Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?
She first looked surprised, then narrowed her eyes and smirked, as if evaluating whether I was naive or just bold. Only later did I learn that this meant, “Would you like to sleep with me tonight?” What a way to start a conversation!
By the way, my coffee arrived unusually fast.
I met a girl on the plane. She was kind, talkative, and suggested we meet up in the city. We sat on the terrace of a café near our hotel, drinking beer at a leisurely pace. She told me about her divorce, her family, and I just listened, smoked, and enjoyed the moment.
There are moments when the right place, the right person, and the right drink come together to create pure bliss. That’s Paris.
The next day, we both got food poisoning from oysters at a restaurant. After that, she distanced herself a bit, but we still keep in touch.
Sometimes I wonder — if not for those oysters, would we have met again? Or did Paris give us exactly what we needed and nothing more?
The Louvre was packed with people. Leonardo da Vinci’s works were breathtaking in their original form, but my heart was captivated by Murillo’s paintings. His beggar boy picking lice from his hair — wasn’t just a painting, it was a whole life captured on canvas.
In Versailles, I befriended an IT guy. He was shy, stuttered a bit, but I introduced him to two beauty-industry girls who radiated pure fun. During our tour of Versailles, we drank champagne at the back of the bus. The IT guy loosened up, and later, we all posed among the gardens, mimicking classical statues.
Turns out, life is beautiful when you’re surrounded by warm, tactile, and kind people.
Parisian skies are a work of art on their own. Impressionist painters knew how to capture their shifting tones, and their works fill the former train station — now the Musée d’Orsay.
Though I still find Gauguin’s escapades in Tahiti unsettling, I can’t deny the raw brilliance of his paintings from that period. They hold a special place in my heart. There’s something about them, wouldn’t you agree?
I met two sisters — one of them was a model, tall, slender, playful. We laughed a lot, I invited them to the museum, and later, we took pictures in front of the elephant statue.
I was small, she was like a fairy from a storybook, and her sister stood in between us. Paris creates strange yet unforgettable moments.
We drank beer right in front of the Arc de Triomphe, and then the younger sister let me take hundreds of photos of her in a gray coat with her blonde hair cascading down. When she lay on her back on the Pont Alexandre III, I realized that happiness is just a feeling of the moment.
The Loire Valley is a world of its own. Medieval halls, enormous vases overflowing with flowers, and the stories of marquises who lived extravagantly. That’s where I met a little girl traveling with her grandmother. She dashed through castle corridors, demanding that I take pictures of her in the most unexpected places — on rooftops, beside water lilies, even standing on her head.
On the bus, she insisted on sitting next to me, looked at me with her dreamy eyes, and said:
— Let’s sleep!
She was seven. It was both funny and surreal.
I wonder — if I met her ten years later, would I recognize her?
Paris allows you more freedom than other cities. You can sit in a café late into the night, talking.
— And sit as long as you want, thank God! — says a Notre Dame gargoyle.
At one café, an old man joined our table. He had worked with Tarkovsky, but now he was a hotel porter. His stories about cinema were mesmerizing, though we suspected he had once played for “the other team.”
At some point, he invited us to a nightclub. We went.
The music was strange — acid techno! One French guy from our group drank too much and was supposed to stay at our hotel because he missed his train. At first, we were happy for him, then we were worried — he disappeared.
I hope he just got on another train and now tells his friends about the eccentric group of travelers he met that night.
Paris is always fun, unpredictable, and exciting. It’s best not to plan anything ahead, because new people and places will always find you.
Some cities leave a mark on you.
Ten years later, the little girl from the bus found me.
— I’ve been looking for you, and I found you! How have you been?
I smiled. I guess she wants me to remind her of the phrase she said to me on the bus. No doubt about it.
Paris never says goodbye.
Paris always gives you a sequel.
Every moment spent with Ni unveils new dimensions of grace and mystery. Dive deeper into her world in:

Trying to get at those travel stories about the verve and the swerve. Not your typical source for travel advice. These are stories about how travel changes you and unfolds you, not how best to be pampered and coddled.

Our interest in travel has something to do with our need to find the swerve. The led-by-the-nose tours suit some but not us. We set out to build adversity and surprise into our personal all-inclusive package. We want to be able to remind ourselves that things like sitting between train cars as a result of thinking it was a good idea to save nine Euros on unassigned seats is nothing more than a gift from heaven to enhance our lives.
The hitches and unforeseen hesitations are the swerves that create the pulse of travel.
This was our plan as we set off to grab a slice of Northern Europe. I have never been to this part of the world and neither has my wife. It was a gap in our travels that we needed to fill. And it was the draw of meeting friends in Paris and Switzerland and the Netherlands that set the outlines for our itinerary.
Our overnight flight left me wide awake with excitement while Stefanie was able to snooze a bit. The route to Paris ran first to Frankfort with its awkward funnel through customs that a weary business traveler commiserated with us on, “The worst!” he said. No ranks of Uzi toting police at the airport as I was led to believe. Then on a jump flight to Charles De Gualle arriving in Paris in the early morning.
We got help with our transit connection from a group of young travelers who like us were trying to find the best and cheapest mode to city center. The bus into town seemed promising but more expensive then the Metro so we found our way to the train station and rode into Paris.
The outskirts were unimpressive. But when we popped out of the subway tunnel into city center we emerged onto that glorious limestone and Mansard roofed landscape of Paris I’ve known from pictures and film. Cafes seemingly every three storefronts, busy Parisians hustling off to work, we spilled onto these streets with our luggage in tow and tried to get our bearings.
Promises of easy access to free wi-fi went unfulfilled (as they would continue to be) so we asked the kind shop steward for directions to Petite de Champs, the address of our lodgings. He pointed us off on a tramp of about ten blocks which we accomplished and proceeded to turn down the street that had Petite de Champs in the name. We found the address over a door that was supposed to be green but wasn’t. Door locked. Asked at the cafe if we could borrow his phone to call the lady and she described her place in variance to what we were seeing. We should have known something was up.
She said the key was upstairs under the mat. Since we couldn’t get in the street door the cafe guy somehow produced a key and let us in. We lugged our travel belongings up four flights and upon winded arrival found no key under the mat as promised. We collapsed in the hall and a dog bark inside one of the flats brought a young lady to the door. Yes, address and apartment number were correct, no she didn’t know our host’s name. This is truly weird. We were clearly missing a piece to this puzzle.
Back we go down to the cafe to discover through a second call and the cafe man’s astute observation that there were TWO Rue Petite de Champs. This one was Rue Croix Petite de Champs (“the road that crosses” our Petite de Champs). So off we march to find the correct Rue and the aforementioned green door and all the details familiar to our host’s descriptions. Our first swerve.
To get to our real Paris abode we climbed another four flights of well worn stair treads to the sound of our screaming calf muscles and behold, find the key under the mat! Our room was tidy and totally sufficient to our needs. We managed to contact our friends who had been if France now touring alredy for a week and made a plan to meet that afternoon. After a long travel day with swerves large and small we settled in for a snooze.
That didn’t last long because we were in Paris and the city was waiting just out there! Off we went to find our friend’s lodgings which were in the same area of Paris, the First Arrondissement north of the Seine. We mapped out the walk to get there but to no avail, missing a turn and requiring further instructions from yet another in our chain of kind shop owners who served us so faithfully. Turning down Rue de Hyacinth we were greeted by our friend’s “Bonjoir” from his second floor balcony. We reunited with our good friends Wolf and Charlotte from San Miguel de Allende and Charlotte’s son Ethan. Sat in their salon (this is Paris after all) to catch up and make our plans for the next few days.
We launched off for an afternoon walk through the gorgeous and immense Louvre courtyards where a cellist was busking under an arch that led towards the pyramid.
Great acoustics there that did his talents proud. We lingered a while to listen and became acquainted with the magic that is The City of Lights. Then down to the Seine to see Notre Dame in one direction and Musee d’Orsay in the other. Our original lodging was to be on a barge in the Seine in front of the Musee but our host there had to cancel due to some hitch with periodic maintenance. Sadly, it was not to be for us but we had moved on. Walking back through the Louvre courtyard back into our neighborhood we found our dinner restaurant. I had duck confit which was fittingly outstanding. The waiter helped me learn to say “I don’t speak French” so I could beg off as needed. I was using “no parlez vous” which accused the person opposite me of not speaking the language. I was also working hard on my “Ravi de vous rencontrer” (“nice to meet you”) which served as my only accomplishment of a multi-word French phrase during our stay in France.
The next day Stefanie and I went back to the Louvre, this time actually going inside. We entered through the pyramid and sat down to map out our visit since this most enormous of art museums requires a strategy to trim the seemingly infinite possibilities. We headed first to the French and Italian painting of the 16th and 17th centuries. We were both stopped dead in our tracks in front of the Holbein portraits. Soft and pulsating flesh that has actual blood flowing through it as best I can tell. Firm and telling hands. Eyes that beg conversation. These people emerge from the years as fully alive and unburdened by any mists of obscurity history presents.
We found an amazing veiled bust of a woman in the Egyptian wing that stood our neck hairs on end. She had all the mystery of the ages wrapped in her half hidden face and could easily have been mistaken for the work of a modern master.
Rooms and rooms of paintings. On through early Renaissance Italian works where Stefanie called me back to pause because I had rushed by a bit. She was right as usual. These were delicate and everyday human renditions that broke from the religious/aristocratic subject matter.
Then rooms and rooms of furniture for the era of the the King Louis’. Seemingly endless collections of amazing craftsmanship but largely vacant of people who, including me, find the style overbearing and fusty. All that effort by expert furniture makers who I’m sure thought their efforts were proffered in a style that represented the pinnacle of everlasting beauty.
Finally, and more by chance than design we crossed by the famous “Winged Victory” to the more populated wing where the icon of all things art resides. “The Cult of the Mona” was in full throng and the packed room focused their cameras on the tiny, charming, sedate portrait that causes people with only a nodding familiarity with art to change their life’s course in order to view. The painting looks just like the reproductions and is just about poster sized as well. Nice but I wasn’t exactly moved to tears by the encounter.
“The Cult of the Mona” throng who were taking pictures, on the other hand, were more interesting to me. The cultural anthropologist in me was interested in expanding on the theory of large groups as they relate to cultural icons. I also wondered how time will operate on this painting. Will we ever actually get over it? Is there life outside the cult? In my picture of the swooning multitudes I counted three who where actually looking with their own eyes at that particular moment.
The next room is where I found my true joy. Against a side wall in a room full of absolute masterpieces was the monumental “Raft of the Medusa” by Theodore Gericault. Depicting the crisis moment after an apparent shipwreck in tossed seas (based on an actual shipwreck with tragic loss of life), the painting presents the survivors huddling and comforting each other while the more intact denizens of this piece of flotsam raise a red cloth to signal a far distant ship. An image of human struggle to maintain hope in the face of nature’s imposition of mortality.
We headed to our rendezvous (Paris thing again…) with our friends in front of Notre Dame Cathedral. We were late but they were later. Our plan was to walk into Sain Germaine across the Seine and time was getting way from us. That and the long line into Notre Dame led us away to cross the river leaving the famous Cathedral for our next visit to Paris.
The West Bank of the Seine is where we came upon the well known green boothed book sellers called “bouguinistes”. We strolled the Seine’s bank and examined the wonderful contents of each booth. Some had the uninteresting plastic tourists mementos but most had great old posters, postcards and photographs tracing the history of Paris. Several vendors were selling truly beautiful etchings and lithographs, many with cityscape and landscape subjects from the past centuries.
We turned back to review the stands once more because our target was the famous Shakespeare Booksellers shop. This landmark of Paris was owned by the person who first published James Joyce’s “Ulysses” and did it while others were still scratching their heads over it. Tight little aisles and racks of books new and old. And full of my favorite variety of human beings; those who read actual books!
Upstairs were small nooks and rooms like comfortable pockets with chairs stuffed right for a relaxed afternoon read. Quiet people with heads pointed towards some tome of literate fantasy or other account of the human project.
Outside we sat on a bench for a little refreshment and it turns out our choice was a famous place of repose. A group of tourists wanted to sit and have their pictures taken there. I obliged, by getting up and saying “What, did Hemingway sit here?” which seemed to amuse them. I’ll have to dig into the bench’s provenance.
We then walked into the neighborhood of Paris that took the prize from us both: Sain Germaine. Here is the true pulse of Paris; in the voices from the cafes and in the silence from old churches, in the beat of the people strolling at ease in the slanting rays of the sun, in the rhythm of five and six story grey limestone edifices capped with the Mansard roofs rising up to shout “Paris!”. I did not want this episode of our travel to end. The pulse had become my own.

Paris is commonly used in music lyrics. Why is such a popular subject? What does Paris mean in these lyrics? How do people perceive Paris?
The Chainsmokers define it as
“1: A sentimental yearning for a reality that isn’t genuine.
2: An irrecoverable condition for fantasy that evokes nostalgia or day dreams.”
Paris gives a sense of fantasy that people don’t have in their mundane life.
“We were staying in ParisTo get away from your parents”
— The Chainsmokers
It’s a place to runaway. It’s a place where you don’t have worry about all the problems.
“But how I’d love to go to Paris again” — The 1975
It’s a romantic and satisfying place that people want to go but never got to go.”
“You and me in ParisFree to be who we arePrisoners of desire”
— Karen Souza
It’s a place of freedom.
“We don’t need a fancy townOr bottles that we can’t pronounce’Cause anywhere babeIs like Paris in the rainWhen I’m with you”
— Lauv
Anywhere can be Paris if you are with the right person. This indicates that Paris is a romantic place filled with love. I have to agree that Paris in the rain is memorable. There aren’t many people with umbrelllas.
“I got Paris Blue hung over my shoulder” — Frequent Flyer
It’s a place that can bring sad and happiness at the sametime.
“April in ParisThis is the feelingNo one can ever reprise”
— Ella Fizgerald
Lyrics just say so much but it seems like it’s necessary to go now. It’s a place that cannot be reprised.
“We’re so Paris when we kissed, when we kissed” — One Direction
It’s more than a place now. It’s a description of how romantic people can be.
“Why oh why do I love Paris Because my love is here
She’s there, she’s everywhereBut she’s really here”
— Frank Sinatra
It’s back to the definitions of all of the above. It’s a fantasy place. This is my favorite song among all songs about Paris.
What’s so great about Paris? I had the same question until I saw the Tour Eiffel blinking at me at 11PM. (It felt like it was winking at me.) Walking around the streets at night with the wind blowing through your hair makes you forget about everything. Seeing Giuseppe Acrimboldo’s Four Seasons at the Lourve, you find out how paitings can communicate to you. Drinking a cup of espresso on the sidewalk makes you love coffee more than ever. Looking at all those famous people buried in Cimetière du Père-Lachaise makes you realize how at the end we are all at the same destination. As people said in thousands descriptions, “You need to see it to know what I mean.”
It’s a place that seems unreal and ideal.
Paris is the best representation of fantasies.
I’d like to live in the Paris for awhile.

What you have to do to prepare to move from San Francisco to Paris in three months.
So, you’ve decided to move from the United States to Paris, France.
Perhaps like myself you made this decision more or less on a whim with no real planning going into it before the decision was made, or perhaps you took a longer, more reasonable approach to the problem. Either way, you now have a series of things to do before you board that airplane.
Now, I should preface this by saying that I’m not a lawyer and I’m not a travel agency. I did find it useful, however, when I was planning my move to read through the notes of other people who had done roughly the same thing. There are only a handful of them on the internet (here are some) and if you’re seriously considering doing this, read them all in addition to this. Your mileage is certain to vary.
What is amazing about this process is that most of it is dictated by government agencies, and yet nearly every step of the process is insanely vague. Therefore, I feel that sharing what we experienced could be hugely helpful to someone else trying to accomplish the same thing. Reading through the consulate docs are one thing, hearing the story of what real people went through is a bit different. Again, this is not a how-to, this is a how-we-did-done.
Well, first things first, getting a French visa. In order to live in France for longer than the normal 3 months a tourist visa gets you, one has to get a long stay visa of some kind. There are several different types of long stay visas you can get, though most are super specific — being a student or an au pair, or marrying a French person. The one that seemed to fit us best was the “D” visa or long stay “visitor” visa. This is actually a little confusing to everyone involved, because I’m going to be working from home essentially, but not for a French company and not doing business in France.
The “D” visa essentially asks you to prove that you can live in France without ever being in danger of getting a job at a French company. I believe it’s normally for people who sort of want to long-vacation in France or semi-retire there, but working for a strange company that lets you work from anywhere fortunately and also occasionally frustratingly blurs the lines. Countries don’t really know what to do with people like me. However, this is the best option I could find that fit me.
Now then, there are 14 steps to the visa application process.
Most of these were actually fairly simple. Some pictures at the Kinkos, fill out the visa form, get your passports, birth certificates and marriage certificate together, etc.
There were, however, some difficulties. Many of which may have been easier had this blog post existed for me.
The first was the “Letter promising not to engage in any employment”. I have no idea what this means. What’s even more confusing about it is that the next thing you need is a “Letter of employment”. This is one of those many instances where language is really quite vague. What I ended up taking this to mean, and which I basically had to specifically verify with the Visa Officer at the French Consulate, is that they mean “We need a letter saying you won’t get a job at a French company, depriving a Frenchman of a job, so prove to us that you have your financial shit together”.
Figuring out what that letter was supposed to say in order to get it signed and notarized was also a little frustrating. There are no templates or anything. We ended up just writing:
“I, <your name here>, promise not to engage in any employment in France.”
And then signing it. And then notarizing it. And then getting weird looks from the Notary Public because why the hell would you notarize that? We got it notarized at the Post and Parcel in Potrero on 18th St. They were super nice and patient with us, I highly recommend them.
The letter of employment was sort of weird, since I’m a cofounder and board member at my company so I was unsure who I was supposed to get to sign it. “Dear France, I work for me. Love, Scott”.
I assume, however, that most people don’t have that issue. They ended up not accepting it anyhow because it didn’t state that the company planned to continue to employ me once I was in France, which is what the consulate was looking for. If you do this, be sure to get that in the letter, in addition to your salary and title. In my case, the proof of means of income was enough that they didn’t much care about the employment letter — basically as long as they don’t think you’ll try to get a job for a French company or that a Frenchman could get, it doesn’t seem to concern them that much.
Proof of medical insurance was a pain for me, but mostly because it’s fairly rare for a US worker to move overseas and need to transition to expat insurance. Most of this was handled by our insurance broker eventually, but coming up with our medical history and whatnot took up most of a day. I ended up going into the consulate with emails saying I was going to get expat insurance and that I had travel insurance currently and they ended up being fine with that. I should do another blog post at some point about how ridiculous the American health care system is and how insane it is that we don’t really own our own medical records, but that’s for another time.
Proof of accommodation and the e-ticket were interesting requirements because they both require you to expend a rather grand amount of money to apply for a visa that in theory you may not be granted. I’ve heard on other blogs that you can get hotel accommodations and a refundable ticket to hedge your bets, but we actually rented a furnished apartment through Lodgis and bought our one way tickets before applying for the visa. Needless to say, I’m pretty glad we ended up actually getting it.
While we’re on that subject, here’s a quick tip. If you move to Europe for a year, buy round-trip tickets. Technically you can’t get a return ticket a year out, so I’m not saying figure out when to come back. I’m saying burn the return ticket.
I didn’t even think about it and one-way tickets were about $2200 each on United so I ended up getting us tickets on Canada Air with a stop in Toronto for about $800 per ticket through some super-shady seeming Kayak referral company. I was fairly certain we were going to get to the airport and the flight wasn’t going to exist.
However, if I had selected a round-trip flight with pretty much any return date, I could have gotten non-stop flights to Paris through United for like $1100 per ticket. Basically adding the extra 15 hour flight home saves you half of your ticket price, contrary to all rational possible logic.
For the love of God, buy round-trip tickets.
We also had to get Josie a new passport since we got her one when she was only a few months old and they only last five years. The passport you have when you apply has to be valid a few months past the end of your stay. Since Jo was almost five when we applied, the passport would have expired during our stay in France.
Getting a new one for her was pretty interesting. We had to do it in person since she’s a minor and appointments were all months away so we had to use the first-come line at the Post Office on Sutter.
There is basically a single place you can get same day passport appointments in San Francisco and it’s pretty much a total shit show. The office opens at 8:30a and by 8:32a there are 15 people in line for a single person working the Passport counter and each applicant takes at least 10 minutes. If you’re there the second the office opens you still have a 45 minute wait. The first time we showed up, I forgot a document too, so we had to do it a second time. Make sure you have everything before you go. Or plan this far enough ahead of time that you don’t need to go into a no-appointment passport office.
So we made the visa appointment about a month and a half in advance and set to work doing all of that, which was pretty easily do-able within that time. Other than the health insurance issue, which ended up being fine, we had no other real problems with any of the requirements.
The visa appointment itself almost could not have been easier. For one, we lived in San Francisco, so we could easily go there in person without having to travel or anything. I had also heard that it could be difficult or confrontative, but everyone we met was really patient and nice to us. Some consulates ask for a “statement of purpose” I’ve heard, but the San Francisco one did not and honestly I think the French are generally like “Of course you want to live in France, France is awesome!”
The only problem that we had was that we physically had our documents in the wrong order. They want them all in exactly the order listed, per person. We had something like “one for me, one for her, next for me, next for her”, etc. They wanted everything for me in order, then everything for her in order. We had to stand there and reorder everything and I don’t think the consulate officer was super happy with us about that. So, make a note if you’re doing this with your family.
Also, minors don’t need visas. Obviously we would have had to get her a new passport anyhow, but we didn’t need to pay the application fee or get her photos or anything. They ended up processing it for her and surprisingly actually issued her a visa (which the officer said they normally don’t do for minors), but it wasn’t necessary. It turns out if the parents get visas, they let their children come with them.
The next step was to find a school for Josephine. This was actually one of the first things we started looking for, but it took us a while to choose, apply for and finalize. It was also pretty stressful looking for a school when you can’t really visit any of them, communicate or search very well in French.
I first started emailing schools in early May, before we had really decided to move. Getting Jo into a school that we felt comfortable with was a prerequisite to moving at all.
It was actually a pretty interesting juggling act, because we wanted to find an apartment, a school for Josie and a language school for Jessica and have them all be relatively close or commute-able. We decided to start with Jo’s school and we narrowed it down to six schools that have at least some English instruction (we had heard that it can be very stressful for English-speaking children in fully French schools as they’re basically special needs children and we’re not citizens — it gets confusing).
A lot of the choices came from an article on EasyExpat.com and a few other searches. We basically ended up deciding based on the fact that only two of the six schools got back to my email at all and one of them was very responsive and easy to communicate with. Perhaps not the greatest way to choose a school, but possibly not the worst way either and it seems to be working out well for her. They do French about half the time and English the other half.
If you are considering moving to Paris and have a child, the following school was personally recommended to us by a local as a great bilingual school for kids who speak English: L’École active bilingue Jeannine-Manuel in the 15th arrondissement. They also recommended École Alsacienne in the 6th, which is on the EasyExpat.com list, while Jeannine-Manuel is not.
We ended up finding an apartment that took cats (whom we decided to try to take with us, more on that later), had an extra room for me to work in and was furnished. It is also nicely close to a Metro line that goes almost directly to Jo’s school. Finally, it was only a short walk to a great language school that Jess decided to enroll in. Everything’s comin’ up Millhouse!
So now that we have a place and schools and plane tickets and visas, we’re really moving! Now the problem is what to take with us. Since the apartment is furnished and it’s going to have to be difficult to ship stuff to France, we decided to basically try to store almost everything. Like, everything we’ve accumulated through 12 years of marriage and 5 years of having a child. However, there were some children's books, technology and clothes and things that would certainly be more than we could check and didn’t really want to re-buy, so we decided to try to ship a couple of boxes.
So now the question is, how do you get a few boxes of stuff shipped to France? Turns out that it’s not actually very easy.
I found out that there is an International Flat Rate 25kg (about 50 lbs) box that you can, in theory, ship to France relatively easily. So we picked up four of them and packed them full and just stored everything else in our lives. This is sort of an interesting philosophical game within your family — what can you live without? At about $300 per box, it’s a really compelling question.
Well, I thought we could just show up to the FedEx with these boxes and pay the flat rate and boom. Nope. Turns out that the boxes are going through customs so you have to declare everything in the box on a form. Literally everything. If you have 5 pairs of shoes you have to list them one item at a time and put how much they’re worth and where they were made and where you got them. For each pair of shoes. I had fucking USB cables and shit in there.
This was incredibly frustrating because we had tons of stuff in these boxes. How much is a jacket you got 3 years ago at Marshall’s worth? I got super frustrated and came damn close to just walking out of the FedEx in a huff when Jessica stepped in and just went through all their hoops. Because she’s a better person than me. So anyhow, if you want to ship something this way, figure out what’s in each box exactly and be prepared for literally hours worth of paperwork at the FedEx office.
We are not smart people. We’ve adopted three FIV-positive rescue cats during our marriage, two of whom are still with us. Technically they’re feral rescues, but only one of them acts like it.
So one of the earliest conversations was what to do with the cats. Do we give them up? Do we see if we can get a family member to watch them? Do we take them with us?
This was actually a pretty difficult conversation because there is no way anyone would ever want these cats. They’re both super sweet, but they’re also FIV-positive which means they have occasional (or in the case of the one, constant) health problems. Problems which can sometimes be expensive. We are literally the only humans on the planet that would continue to keep these cats alive.
What made things a little easier is that it turns out, contrary to what we had both believed, domestic cats don’t have to go through a quarantine process. It’s actually somewhat simple to move to another country with them, process-wise.
You have to get sky kennels that meet the USDA and IATA requirements for shipping live animals. We initially got ones that were way too small for international travel and had to buy new ones. You have to get a vet that is licensed by the USDA to check the animals and they have to be chipped with an international chip and get a rabies vaccine booster. Then within a week of leaving you have to make an appointment to go to the USDA/APHIS office and present all of the forms that your vet gave you.
We went to the APHIS office at 389 Oyster Point Blvd, Suite 2 in San Francisco (really far south, by the airport). The USDA person there was super nice and everything went pretty smoothly. Our vet at the Mission Pet Hospital in San Francisco was able to put all the documentation together for us, including the French forms.
You can find most of this online, but in several different places and it can be a little confusing. We thought that we had to take the cats to a special USDA vet or something, but that wasn’t the case — our long time vet was able to do it and we just had to take the forms to the USDA/APHIS office.
Finally you have to call your airline and make sure they have an animal hold on the flight you want to book. Actually, technically, you want to do this first, since the rest of this is done in the last weeks before you take off. Then on the day of, you have to go to the cargo area of the airport and drop them off, present the forms the USDA gave you and off you go. When you land, you pick them up from the cargo area there. Not the easiest, certainly, but not impossible.
You can also bring smaller animals on the plane with you sometimes, but I thought our scaredy-cats would be less stressed if there weren’t a thousand people around.
Then it was just the moving process. We hired horrible movers who took forever, like multiple days, and still didn’t finish everything. Which means we ran out of time and I had to hire DeliverSF to come to our house after we had flown away to finish up everything.
We got an AirBNB in the last few days to stay in while we coordinated all the moving out and cleaning up.
Strangely, the morning we were to leave there was a 6.0 magnitude earthquake that woke me up a little early. I guess San Francisco didn’t really want me to leave. Finally, we got up and took a cab from the AirBNB in the early morning to the airport.
It’s actually pretty jarring to leave. All three of us have lived in California for our entire lives. Jess and I both grew up in Ventura and both went to college here. We moved to the Bay Area basically exactly the time we got married. Our entire 12 years of marriage, all of our real adult lives in truth, have been spent here. It is a world we know and a world we love. Stepping outside this zone of incredible comfort and support for us is harder than I thought it might be, the lure of adventure aside. However, I think it’s the right choice. Stepping into the uncomfortable is the only way to ever do anything truly amazing.
So, au revoir, San Francisco and hello, Paris! I hope you treat us well.

It’s been a good long while since I popped on here to share anything about books and/or life, but when life gets busy I tend to get quiet. As any of your in corporate life know, the first quarter comes in like a lion with everyone ready to do All The Things as quickly as possible.
But stepping back in time to last fall, I wanted to share two special trips that Sergio and I took in 2023. Coming into 2020 we had talked about our desires to take our parents on bigger trips — rather than looking back with regret when they were at an age when traveling was more challenging, we wanted to prioritize these trips.
One global pandemic and more than three years later, we finally made good on these plans at the end of 2023 — a trip to Paris and Rome with Sergio’s parents and sister, and a separate trip to to Prague, Dresden, and Berlin with my parents and my brother.
Anyone who knows me at all knows I’m itchy and somewhat twitchy if I don’t have a trip planned, but a multi-generational trip was something a bit different for me. Today I’ll share some highlights and what I learned from our first trip with the Ricos to Paris and Rome, but if you don’t make it any further than this, remember that planning — along with realistic expectations — are your best friend.
Alors…
I have nothing but love for Paris — and I’m talking about pre-influencer Paris, but the Paris of 2023 is far different than my first trip to the City of Light in 2008. Back then we carefully held onto our museum passes as they were stamped one by one, made sure we had enough euros for everything, and bought packs of tiny paper tickets to use the Metro.
NO MORE MY FRIENDS, NO MORE. If you expect to show up and walk into anything, you shall spend your vacation in lines. It’s not that Paris hasn’t always been this beautiful or popular, but that international travel is more accessible to more people than ever! This is amazing, but is particularly tricky if you’re going to tour Paris with people who aren’t ready to run to and fro, this is where your planning has to start.
After spending some time re-familiarizing myself through the prolific works of St. Rick Steves, we implemented one of my favorite travel strategies when traveling in a group, What’s Your One Thing? It’s exactly what it sounds like — what is the one thing in this particular city that you must do, that thing you’d regret skipping? Prioritization is critical on any big city trip, but when you’re considering different physical abilities or budgets, this is the best way to include the most-desired spot for each traveler (no-vetos!).
[Mine tends to be some sort of museum or cultural site because I AM ME and I could spend an entire vacation doing three museums a day and then reading alone in a hotel room at night but again, that’s just me!]
The great news? Paris has so many lovely sites and many of them don’t suffer from a repeat visit. We also tend to have similar travel preferences — none of us were there for the nightlife or the boutique shopping or Michelin restaurants. That made it rather simple to make sure that Sergio made it to Versailles and I got (another) visit to the Rodin Museum, which really and truly is my favorite in Paris while my sister-in-law got her show at Moulin Rouge.
With your initial list of sites, I recommend putting together a shared Google Map with all of the possibilities. This is important for any trip, but we found it especially necessary for traveling with our parents (all in their 70s) to minimize the amount of walking or number of Metro transfers. This allows you to make a call on what sorts of transport make sense for a particular city.
If it is accessible to you — and let’s be honest, a lot of it isn’t — the Metro is the best way to get around Paris (get a Navigo pass with a photo — it took us 45 minutes to figure it out but I was proud that we did it!). However, it’s full of steps with many stations lacking elevators or escalators. We lucked out in that we were able to make it work — barely. The traffic in Paris can be really horrific but we did use Uber when needed instead of walking (my personal preference) to make sure that we were pacing ourselves as a group.
Thank you, Internet, for making it easy to add restaurants to our shared map as well. If you spend more time than expected in a museum, it’s tempting to stop into the nearest cafe to eat. However, a little bit of research gave us multiple options to make sure we could find different types of cuisine to try (and was helpful for me given my dietary restrictions). We also split up at times to try different spots, especially when we had differing levels of hunger (Sergio and I tend to eat 3 American Square Meals and the rest of the family follows the Latin country cadence of breakfast, late large lunch, and small or no dinner).
Another set of activities that is great for senior travelers would be bus, boat, or (in Rome) golf cart tours! These maximize the sites you can see while seated, and, if done early in your time in a city, provide a good overview. I did a lot of research to pick a good boat tour in Paris and a golf cart tour in Rome because some of these companies really cater to the unprepared, which could mean more time in lines and possibly a sub-par experience.
Random isn’t a good plan for big European cities these days — you’ll need a reservation for major sites like the Louvre or the Eiffel Tower (which we missed — oops!) or you’ll stand in a long, long, long, long line, or just be completely out-of-luck. The Paris Museum Pass helps get you into many sites, but separate entry reservations are often required. In Paris, big sites also mean security lines and possibly restrictions on bags that you can bring with you. This is where a Rick Steves guide comes in handy — you can learn which entrance is fastest at the Louvre or how to see St Chapelle before the security line is too long.
What we ended up with was a great blend of structure and flexibility. We planned one key event each day (eg; a museum, a tour, a day-trip) and a meal together. This was usually in the morning, as getting to an attraction first thing can mean a shorter security line (sometimes). Because our hotel had a great breakfast buffet, it was easy to get up, grab something to eat, and get out off the door by 8:30 or 9:00. This generally resulted in a lunch around 1pm, which created a natural breaking point. Folks could rest or nap at the hotel, or we could go to other interesting sites or shop in the neighborhood. This left time to find souvenirs, try desserts, or find another Engligh language bookstore (hi, it’s me) or even just walk through a church or a park. It also means you’ll stop by secondary sites and get to know them well — whether it’s the very under-rated church of St. Sulpice, the Paris Zoo, the Conciergie, or Napoleon’s Tomb (aka three miles of walking that looks like three blocks — whoops!).
Paris is much easier if you can speak some French — and as the only sort-of French speaker on the trip, I was the one who stepped in if no-one spoke English. I find the French to be generally kind and helpful if you are polite (not a loud American) and are respectful. This means saying bonjour when you enter, asking before you handle produce at a market, etc. These are actually very simple things to do — any good guidebook can help you! — that show respect and create goodwill for an interaction. Most people in France can speak some English (or are completely fluent) and are generally willing to switch to English if you graciously ask, Parlez-vous Anglais, s’il vous plait? That being said, I knew enough that when we did encounter people who didn’t speak English that we were able to get by in French (think of immigrants who are newly-learning French to make their way in the country). I think with joy about a lovely woman who cooked us the best meal in France in a tiny kitchen in a market who spoke French and Arabic — so my sad French got us through it! It’s one of my favorite memories of the trip because you don’t need that many words to share a connection with someone else. Don’t always believe the hype — start by asking yourself how you can adapt to get the best experience and go from there.
But before too long, it was time to travel to Rome. After researching options the most cost effective — balanced with the amount of time — was to fly. All I will say is this — coach seats on ITA are punishingly small and you always need an extra hour in CDG, no matter how fast you think it will be.
So, let’s keep this honest. Italy is my least favorite country in Europe.
It’s closely followed by Spain (super surprising given that I visited it with a Spanish speaker, but it was the wrong type of Spanish, the Latin-American variety…), but I wanted to give Rome another good try. I know so many folks who love it and it’s full of incredibly history and museums, which is perfect for me. Our previous visit was in December, which was a little bit less engaging — and we also struck out the food. I also had travel companions that were incredibly excited for Rome, so I wanted them to enjoy it too.
Those fantastic planning skills I mentioned above? These were even more critical for Rome because holy crap was the city overrun with tourists in the second week of October and why is everyone doing a TikTok dance in front of the Colosseum? Given all of this, it’s much more important to prioritize your sightseeing and get creative with your entrance times and to make sure that you have enough shade, water, and rest for everyone, not just the elderly. There’s nothing like sweating through your entire outfit, right?
For some reason, some of the sites like the Colosseum or the Vatican Museums make it nearly impossible to get in without either buying a combo-ticket (which might include a site that you don’t want or an included meal you don’t want to eat) or joining a “follow-the-flag” tour. This was completely different than our visit six years ago, and it’s the absolutely worst. Most tickets are sold to resellars who maximize profit with these upsells, and even if you tried you’re not able to get these other tickets.
As a planner and an independent thinker I found this incredibly irritating and it felt to me like we had less flexibility! We had to check in more than 30 minutes early for a tour-guide who did a really poor job with the Colosseum, and without a combo ticket for a lunch we didn’t eat, we wouldn’t have been able to see the Vatican Museums or the Sistine Chapel (so you’re welcome, Pope Francis, for the extra donation to your country). Even with my months-ahead planning, we couldn’t get tickets for the Roman Forum — but in fairness, I was probably the most disappointed about that.
My favorite site this visit was the Capitoline Museum that overlooks the Forum and the Colosseum. Sergio and I hadn’t visited it on our first trip so this was my choice for my One Thing. We did it on the hottest day as some (but not all) of the rooms were air conditioned. With incredible art, architecture, sculpture, and views, it was almost tourist-free and quite enjoyable. The tablet guides were essential as none of us spoke Italian — and it was pure luck if you encountered someone who was fluent-ish in English. We also benefitted from an incredible cab driver who drove us around the back way so our older travel companions didn’t have to climb one thousand stairs to the top of the hill. I did appreciate the care and respect for elders that I noticed throughout the trip.
Central Rome is a rather compact, flat and walkable — minus temperates in the 80s and 90s and no real breeze to speak of. Another challenge to keep in mind if you are traveling with older people is that there is almost nowhere to sit down in public in Rome, and if you sit on the steps someone will come and angrily ask you to stand up. I’ve never been to museums where the only place you can really sit down is on a toilet when you need to use the restroom. Perhaps this is a reason so many people sit down in the church pews to rest aching legs and pray for a break!
The Metro is very limited so we used cabs to get around most days. Though they are in theory quite reasonable, we were overcharged more than once — even official cabs “forget” to run the meter. Because we usually had to take two cabs as we were five people, it was extremely obvious that a six to ten euro price difference in cabs that departed from and arrived at the same place one minute apart from each other were not on the up-and-up. Travel means getting ripped off sometimes, and thankfully this was the extent of it (or perhaps a slight mark-up on a dinner). We were very careful with our money and passports, especially in crowded areas, and we stayed in safe areas of the city. This is important for everyone, no matter your age, to be aware of your surroundings and know how to ask for help if you need it.
That’s not to say we didn’t have great cab experiences either — like this man who took all of us at once, or the gentle man who drove us from our hotel to the Vatican Museums, chit-chatting nonstop in Italian, but then, at a stoplight, holding out his hand to me and saying in perfect American English, “Hi, I’m Bob” and then right back to the Italian for the rest of the ride. Bob was good people.
These delightful local encounters are the ones I’ll remember the most, whether the accommodating and helpful staff at Hotel Lancelot, the wonderful woman who led our market tasting tour, or the staff at one of the cat sanctuaries who knew cat people when they saw them and let us get our feline fix, if only for thirty minutes. We were lucky to travel with two extroverts, and my beautiful and kind sister-in-law was made for the Italian joviality and spirit! Sometimes you envy those characteristics that are so natural for some people, but not for you.
Here’s the other part of a family trip that you can’t overlook — making space for alone time or couples time. As the most introverted person on the trip, I knew I’d do better if I built in some time for rest and relaxation. I chose not to go on a day-trip that Sergio planned for Orvieto — which was a wild success! — and instead visited a nearby church, had a long lunch, and napped and rested in our hotel. A part of planning is also understanding what each person needs from an energy standpoint. Do people need a midday rest or an extra hour to wind-down at night? Or do you do best with a morning coffee along before everyone else tromps into the breakfast room? Take that into account too — speak up for what you need to manage your energy and refrain from judging the energy or rest needs of your fellow travelers. We are all at our best when we can tap into the ways that we relax and recharge, whatever they are.
I do love trying local cuisine, so I made a point of getting deeper into restaurant research and we did find some real gems, from a wine bar across the street from stores that sold habits and candlesticks to a tiny neighborhood trattoria with the best truffle pasta I’ve ever had in my life. We splurged for one of Rome’s nicest old-school restaurant, complete with an incredibly kind waiter who teased and joked but provided best-in-class service and a whole plate of butter on request.
It was joyful to see these places through the eyes of Sergio and his family and to see them again in a different light for myself. I’m not naturally meant for Italy, I don’t think, but with a more positive frame of mind there were lovely things that I missed the first time around. And when you try different experiences and talk to locals, you can see a place through their experiences too.
The massive drawback to Rome was the hoards of tourists more interested in a dance or a pose in front of a fountain than learning about the two thousand years of history, culture, and all that happened in this place. It’s ROME! I wanted to yell at these folks who occupied whole sidewalks such that one had to step into traffic in the street to walk around them. This stupid sort of tourism that’s taking over places like Dubrovnik, Amsterdam, Venice, or Barcelona, not to mention the crush in smaller towns like Hallstatt, Bruges, or Porto. Of course everyone can want a photo to say, “Hey, I went to [insert cool place]!” You’ve been looking at our photos of amazing places that we visited throughout this entire blog.
But is that the attraction — just going there? Isn’t it more interesting to see the Chains of St. Peter or The School of Athens or Trajan’s Column? I’ll get down off of my cranky old person soapbox in a moment, but c’mon folks! You can sample great gelato and check out some art; you can get a cute photo at the Forum and see the temples. We are lucky enough to live at a time when we know more than ever about those who came before us and we’re lucky enough to have technology to help these sites come alive. There is a world behind a screen — so if you just want to hang out with your phone, give everyone else a break and perhaps stay home.
Where did I land with Italy? This second trip was certainly more enjoyable than the first because of my travel companions… and I think I’m good for now. We’ve visited about half of Europe’s countries, so I’m ready to see some of those first before another loop back to Italy.
But… all-in-all, this was a fantastic trip with all sorts of experiences where we lucked out with hotels and made do with the unseasonably warm weather. The planning truly made it easier to adapt to different travel preferences and needs, and I’d say the trip was a smashing success.
And now the plot twist. Because travel doesn’t always go as expected, does it?
We had all packed and were ready for our flights back home to the United States and Mexico, respectively. We had to be out of the hotel by 5:30am to catch our flight to London to transfer for our flight home and the rest of the Ricos had an 11:30pm flight back to Mexico. I woke up in a cold sweat at one in the morning and proceeded to be violently ill for hours and hours. I am so, so, so sorry to all of the poor people on our floor who had to listen to all of… that, but I was that special kind of sick where my only thought was don’t die don’t die don’t die. Sergio went down to the front desk in the wee morning hours and managed to keep our room for an extra day and change our flights with British Airways to the following day. I don’t remember much of it, but my body was shaking so hard with chills that my intercostal muscles ached for days afterwards.
This is probably a story for another blog, but I’m unfortunately much more of an expert on getting food poisoning despite how careful I tend to be with what I eat and drink. That is an unfortunate part of having an inflammatory bowel disease, but I’ve learned a lot through these experiences, and in the future I’ll find a non-gross, non-graphic way to share my recovery protocol.
I was very lucky to be traveling with a doctor (my father-in-law) and a nurse (my mother-in-law) and they have the world’s most tricked-out travel medicine kit that they opened to us. They were differently unlucky with their own flight delays (a late-night flight pushed eight or nine hours later into the morning)! Thankfully our second attempts at departure worked — we flew home without incident (and, in my case, with basically no food) and though it was a wee-hours-of-the-morning connection in Mexico City, the rest of the Ricos made it home too.
What would I leave you with from this trip? Do it. Take the trip and don’t wait. Make the best of what you have now because none of us are guaranteed good health into the future. In our case, all of the planning ahead of time made the trip much easier and removed a lot of mental load while we were there and gave us time to really connect and experience these places together. Whether it’s Rome or Paris, resting on a beach, climbing a mountain, or taking a cruise, you and your family are worth that time together. I hope you take it with those you love.
Au revoir, S
P.S. See you soon with a Jan/February book review and then (hopefully) another blog about our travels to Prague, Dresden, and Berlin with my family— our first European Christmas!

I kicked off the New Year alone in Paris with nothing to do.
It was my first ever New Year’s Eve spent out of the country, not to mention alone, and I had only a few short days to make a game plan. Right off the bat, I decided that, given the choice between an all-out nightclub with strobe lights and disco balls vs. staying home by myself with a bottle of red wine, I’d opt for the latter. But ideally I wanted to find some middle ground between the two — maybe a quaint bistro party with sparkling conversation en français, or possibly a sophisticated and slightly fancy family fête, complete with warm pork roasts, multiple rooms to roam, and a guest list of 40 people.
As soon as I started asking around, I quickly learned that local bistros either morph into club scenes or are shut down completely on New Year’s Eve. It would be hard, as a temporary city resident, to stumble upon the ideal setting and scenario on my own. I also discovered that most Parisians stay in for the ceremonious ball drop, surrounded by close friends and family, either gathering locally in the city or stead departing for their country homes. That left me with one option — somehow get invited to a Parisian house party.
There were two fairly significant problems with this plan:
Then of course there was the question of trust. You can’t just ask anybody off the street to join them for New Year’s Eve — there has to be some vetting factor to give yourself a little bit of security and peace of mind. So, over the next three days, I decided I needed to spend as much time as possible in local restaurants, cafés, and other local hangs in search of new friends to ring in the New Year.
As you know, I like traveling alone and do this with some regularity. It’s particularly fun for me to look for opportunities in social settings around me to interject myself and learn something new, and I have a few general rules that I follow when looking for the perfect hang:
With all this in mind, I set out to maximize the number of opportunities spent in these types of places over the next three days. Not going to lie — this is not always the most comfortable social experience. Here’s why. Even after I find a location — say, a café — that meets these criteria, the next thing to do is position myself in a location that invites conversation. If I’m at a bar or bistro bar, I will sit only one seat away from the next closest person at the bar, or sometimes even squeeze myself in as the open seat in between two smaller parties. This surprising social move, while slightly awkward for a moment, has been a pretty effective technique for me to at least trigger a small-talk conversation.
If there is nobody sitting in that area yet, the next best thing I can do is position myself in a highly trafficked location, make eye contact with everybody that walks by, and smile. In that one gesture I look for people who also happen to be showing up with a similar mission as myself: Making new fast friends. Sometimes, someone may walk in who’s meeting a friend running late, sometimes that smile may encourage somebody to sit down next to you, or sometimes I’ll get roped into a small group conversation nearby. Yes, I’ll be honest: This likely involves unbreaking eye contact with strangers for a few seconds longer than normal. The good news is that you can practice it and that there’s really no downside, as the chances of seeing anybody again are relatively remote.
If all else fails, I just use the resources around me and make small talk with the wait staff in French. In my case, this would inevitably throw off triggers and red flags to everyone around me that I’m not a native French speaker. Sometimes this would work to my advantage and another patron else would jump in and ask where I’m from. (People typically assume from my accent that I’m from the UK. On my proudest day ever in France, I was asked if I was from Belgium.)
But even if none of this happens and nobody strikes up a conversation with me, even if nobody sits close enough to me in order to start chatting, I have one strict rule for myself: Stay off my phone. Pulling out a smartphone at a restaurant or café is the kiss of death to meeting new people. It sends an instant sign to everyone around you that you’re more absorbed with whatever it is you’re doing, reading, or responding to than the environment around you. I’ve found that no matter how distractedly I fiddle with my phone, it’s still a real blocker toward meeting new friends in the real world. I try to keep it off the table and in my purse.
Instead, I carry a book. Oddly, reading a real, print book in public does not seem to have the same effect on people with regard to them keeping their distance. People seem to feel less threatened by it, and I get interrupted while reading all…the….time. The other benefit of having a book with you is that, even if you don’t achieve the holy grail of sparkling new conversation with strangers, at the very least you can fall back on a (hopefully) good read.
So, with this in mind and book in hand, I set out to make friends and conquer Paris. Some places where I made friends included:
But as of midday on December 31, while I had managed to meet about a dozen new people with these tactics, my New Year’s options consisted of the following:
Needless to say, this was not exactly what I was looking for.
When traveling alone, it’s always important to have a backup plan in any situation. In this case, my Plan B for New Year’s Eve was as follows: Wander around the neighborhood and try to find a happening (yet sophisticated) bistro party. (Note: This plan also also included stockpiling a bottle of champagne and some food at home, just in case I was unable to find anything interesting to do and needed to toast the New Year’s alone.)
I decided to take on a stretch of bistros in the 6th arrondissement along Boulevard Raspail, within walking distance of where I was staying. My loose game plan was this: Wander slowly past bistros, peer inside to scope out the scene and the people, and see if there is a venue or group that looks inviting enough for me to join. A few blocks away, I noticed a corner with 2–3 restaurants back-to-back. I decided to check it out. One of them was just a sit-down dinner spot, with families in mid-meal. The second was a bit more lightly populated without any buzz or energy whatsoever. The third, while also mostly comprised of families dining out, had one thing the other two didn’t — a large gathering area by the bar, which happened to be decked out with champagne flutes. Bingo.
Bypassing the crowds who were waiting for tables, I walked in, ordered myself a champagne, and waited. It was 9:30 p.m. Presently, there were two older couples at the bar and another family milling about. I guessed that more people would fill into this area as we approached midnight. I drank my champagne very….slowly…. But nothing happened. I passed the time by vigilantly watching the jazz combo that was floating through the restaurant and performing for different tables.
Unfortunately, by 10:15 p.m. not much had changed. Multiple other folks and families had wandered in and out of the bar, but merely as a holding area prior to their seated dinner. None of them seemed interested in talking to me. I was the only person there alone. Not great.
From the bartenders, I found out that there would be dancing downstairs leading up to midnight. “You’re in the right place,” he assured me. We’ll see about that, I thought. I looked outside. There were now easily 75 people waiting in a line to enter the building. So I decided to give it one more drink before trying my luck elsewhere. This time, I asked for a recommendation and was recommended a “mix-your-own” champagne cocktail with infused gin, raspberry syrup, and fresh berries.
About five minutes later, another couple approached the bar, decidedly younger than most of the other patrons I had met up that evening. They spoke in French with each other quietly as they poked through the cocktail menu, but then I heard the unmistakable query directed my way: “Excuse me, but what is it that you’re drinking?” I turned to see the woman pointing at my mix-your-own-drink creation and explained to her in French which beverage I had tried. She thanked me and turned back to her friend. She ordered the same drink. And, had I detected a faint accent in her French?
Going on a limb, I decided to try my luck, and I asked her in English: “Are you traveling in Paris as well for the New Year’s?” She looked at my silently for a full 10 seconds, and I panicked thinking how rude it was for me to assume her nationality. But then she replied. “Actually, yes. I’m working here teaching English to French children but I’m from Chicago. I’m Alina*. This is my friend, Georges*, a true Parisian, born and raised.”
This tiny intro was enough to catalyze a full-on conversation between the three of us, mostly in English, a little in French. I learned they were here because one of their good friends was the guitar player in the traveling jazz combo who had been performing around the restaurant.
“Oh bummer, you just missed them,” I remarked. “They were playing all over the restaurant but stopped about 20 minutes ago.”
“Actually, they are playing downstairs now,” Alina said. “We came to see them, and were supposed to be able to get in to see our friend but they told us that it’s for paying dinner guests only. We’re just waiting for them to come by the bar and let us down there.”
“Ah, so the dance party downstairs has already begun?” I asked. “Good to know. I’d love to check it out before I leave so let me know what you learn.”
We spent the next 10–15 minutes chit-chatting about my trip and their lives in Paris. He works in IT; she’s a new teacher who just moved to Paris a few months ago. They were both around my age. Georges grew up with Martin, the guitar player downstairs, and their friendship has continued to grow strong over the past decade or two. To show support for their friend, Alina and Georges left the house party to come and see their him perform. They really wanted to see the show.
At one point, Alina decides we should all make a break for it. Realizing that the entrance to the fete requires only acquiring a gold wristband at the door, we carried our cocktails and headed downstairs. Moments later, we found ourselves squarely secured inside of the jazz combo dance party, a spacious room lined on the perimeter with cocktail tables where families and couples sprinkled about. The room was bathed in a fuschia light, with the combo playing upfront. It’s decidedly classy. The lead singer fed the room’s vibe by offering us an American jazz classic; her nonchalance and easy vocalizations bounced off all of the walls.
The bar downstairs was lined with champagne flutes ready to be poured, and I headed over to investigate. But as soon as I did so, a man in a suit approached my new friends, sternly telling them in French something that appeared to make them both instantly dejected. At that, they started to head toward the door.
“Hey guys, wait — what’s up?” I called at them.
“We have to leave,” said Alina. “Apparently this party is for dinner guests only.”
“But don’t they know that you have a friend in the band?” I asked.
“Yes, we told them, but they are being super strict about it.”
“Hang on, that’s not fair. I didn’t have dinner here either.”
“Well you should stay for sure!” piped in Georges. “In fact, we need you to stay. Please go tell Martin how sorry we are that we weren’t able to see him.”
“What? So that’s it? You’re leaving?” I’m annoyed on their behalf. These folks came all the way from the 11th arrondissement to see their friend play on New Year’s Eve.
“Tell him we’ll be upstairs waiting. We’ll see you up there afterward I guess too,” said Alina, eying the door. “We have to go.”
And then they left, leaving me alone again. Glass of champagne in hand, I turned to face the music. But it wasn’t the same.
One of the best parts about traveling alone is that it’s pretty easy to slip through the cracks. If you walk into a packed restaurant with a line out the door, you can often cut it all on the spot by agreeing to sit in that one awkward seat at the bar. If you run into a café right as they are about to close, as just one person, they might make a late dish just for you. If you’re shopping at a boutique and trying to haggle for a certain promotional offer on your purchases, it’s more likely the shopkeeper will let an exception slide by for one person, as opposed to a small group. And if you’re hanging around a bar at a fancy bistro on New Year’s Eve for long enough, the bistro owners will decide it’s not a problem for you to bypass the “dinner guests only” rule and hang around until the clock strikes twelve.
But this time, it didn’t seem right for me to enjoy this party and the jazz combo while the friends who traveled across the whole city to see him couldn’t enjoy it too.
I considered my options:
Of the three of these, which do you think I chose?
A few more minutes passed as I assessed the scene around me. Waitstaff and bartenders were frantically darting in and out of the bar, preparing for the shift of the masses from upstairs to downstairs. But I needed a manager or head waiter of some sort. Finally, I saw a man in a custom-fit blazer race by me, monitoring the setting downstairs on his way.
“Excusez-moi de vous déranger, Monsieur, mais j’ai une petite question,” I announced. Translation: Sorry to bug you but I have a small question.
“Oui?” he turned his full attention to me. I began, to the best of my ability, a French persuasive argument.
“Well sir, as it turns out, I have two friends upstairs who at the bar who I would like to be able to join me downstairs. They are actually here because their friend is performing in the band, and they would really like to see him, but they were told that they can’t come downstairs as they did not eat dinner here. I understand this rule, but is there any way that they could come back downstairs with me to see him perform?”
He assessed me a bit more closely. I tried not to cringe at any grammar mistakes I had made in that plea. I thought about adding in one last caveat: “And since nobody here is dancing yet, I’m sure they would be up for it and liven up the room,” but decided against it, not knowing their tendencies in that area. At last, he nodded, took my champagne glass, and stowed it on the bar to be safe upon my return.
“Come with me,” he said. “Point out your friends to me.”
He hustled up the stairs, with me two quick steps behind. At the top, I stood next to him and pointed out the couple, and he rushed over to them, acknowledged what we had discussed, and began to lead them back in my direction. He had the hostess take care of their coats, and walked all three of us back downstairs together, calling out what he had done to the doorman on the way in.
And with that, we were reunited downstairs. Alina and Georges were elated, albeit a little confused. To be fair, so was I. But we didn’t overthink it. And within a matter of minutes, Alina (who apparently had taken years of swing dance classes back in the U.S.) was stepping her way around the dance floor. Georges, meanwhile, whose style seems more akin to that of Danny Kaye, literally stole the show on the last number with an improv piece of pantomime and hilarity as he cheered on his friend in the front of the room. It may have been one of the funniest things I have ever seen — it takes a truly brave soul to have no fear and to just dance with abandon like that. At the end of the set, the band got a hearty round of applause, and my new friends had their fair share of patrons run up to them and compliment their impressive dancing skills.
After the conclusion of the performance, I met the rest of the band, including Martin, the guitar player, and we spent the next 20–30 minutes chatting and dancing. But at 11:30 p.m., Alina and Georges realized that it was getting late, and they needed to head back to their other party. The three of them turned to me as they prepared to bundle up and leave: “Would you like to join us? We’re heading up to the 18th arrondissement with friends.”
I paused to consider my options. That was all the way across town, so if I were to attend, I would no longer be within walking distance of my return at the end of the evening. I looked back around the room again. While certainly a classy and fun party, being at this bistro alone was the epitome of finding loneliness in a crowd. Aside from Alina and Georges, nobody else had given me the time of day to chat. I decided I’d rather ring in midnight in the company of my new friends than around a group of anonymous strangers. It would be worth the trip. So the four of us hopped on the Metro.
As we approached the Concorde stop on the M8 line, my phone revealed that we’d crossed the threshold. “It’s midnight everyone!” I shouted to no one in particular. Our Metro car cheered. Outside we heard the roar of a collective crowd shouting and screaming somewhere above ground at Place de la Concorde. The doors closed and silenced the ceremony. Our driver gave the horn a few long “toots.” Alina started to sing “Auld Lang Syne.” By 12:01 we were already at the Madeleine Metro stop, and the moment had passed. It would be close to 12:30 a.m. before we would walk into the house party with more of their friends to be greeted by a warm group of Parisians in an apartment that smelled like a mix of champagne and cigarettes. And I wouldn’t have had it any other way.
*Not their real names.

In Woody Allen’s classic movie “Annie Hall,” he’s waiting in line outside a movie theatre and a pompous guy behind him is pontificating to his wife — pompsplaining — about Marshall McLuhan, the prophetic philosopher and educator on culture and technology. Allen gets into a heated argument with the guy, basically saying it’s ok to be totally wrong about McLuhan but just not so loud about it.
The guy self-importantly announces something like, “well I happen to be a professor at Columbia University and I teach a course on culture and media and I know my McLuhan.” To which Woody says, “oh really, well I happen to have Marshall McLuhan right here,” and he pulls the actual living Marshall McLuhan from behind a screen who proceeds to tell the professor, “I heard what you were saying, and you know nothing of my work. How you ever got to teach a course in anything is totally amazing to me.”
Is there any better way to win an argument? “Well, I’ve got Socrates right here and…”
As Woody Allen said, though, “wouldn’t it be great if real life were like this?” Which, of course, it isn’t. In real life, deliverance in an argument is many degrees of separation away.
Except in real life I had this experience (kinda) with a Pulitzer Prize winning poet. It turns out that only two degrees of separation is enough to get a real, live, acclaimed poet to personally settle a question about a poem.
But this was not a movie. In real life, nothing was delivered. I lost the debate.
I organize several poetry reading groups for people who are poetry-curious or poetry-reluctant. I’m no professor, no academic, I’m just an enthusiast who has discovered that it’s not hard to get even poetry-averse people enthused by and often in love with a poem, if the poem is any good.
For one group, I recently gathered a selection of poems about Paris, and one was by a poet whose name and work I was unfamiliar with. I had been hunting specifically for Paris poems so I’m sure I found this one by its title: “In Paris.” I was unfamiliar with the poet but instantly captured by the poem.
The poet is Carl Dennis. I figured I’d look him up to have something to say to the group. To my private (and now public) embarrassment and chagrin, Dennis was unknown to me but was hardly unknown outside my own little orbit. In 2002, he won a Pulitzer Prize in poetry, eclipsing the other two nominees, both of whom were future Pulitzer winners. His poetry has been published in many important magazines and poetry journals, including some I have occasion to read.
I also learned that Dennis taught for years in the English Department at the State University of New York at Buffalo, where the faculty included renowned poets whose names I did know and have even read, like Robert Creeley, Charles Olson, Susan Howe, Anselm Hollo, and Charles Bernstein. (Disclosure: I’m no fan of the “schools” of poetry these poets were part of and I don’t read much of their stuff.)
To make matters even worse for me, I went to SUNY/Buffalo. And I was an English major. And I was learning there (allegedly) while Carl Dennis was teaching there. We were one degree of separation away as I walked past his classroom.
Maybe he only taught graduate students. Or may it was the early 1970’s and I was a long-haired kid from Brooklyn whose main influence was Groucho Marx and Jefferson Airplane. And Dennis really was an unknown poet back then. So our one-degree gap was all it took to keep me in the dark.
But for present purposes, I now had my intro about Dennis for the poetry group. Everyone had a good laugh when I gave this background about my unknown poet, after which I read his poem aloud.
And for a long while no one spoke. You could hear the silent re-reading, the thinking, the unsaid questioning. We were all engaged, provoked by a poem, and, since the poem was about Paris, maybe a little in love. Here’s the poem.
Today as we walk in Paris I promise to focusMore on the sights before us than on the womanWe noticed yesterday in the photograph at the print shop,The slender brunette who looked like youAs she posed with a violin case by a horse-drawn omnibusNear the Luxembourg Gardens. Today I won’t linger longOn the obvious point that her name is as lost to historyAs the name of the graveyard where her bonesHave been crumbling to dust for over a century.The streets we’re to wander will shine more brightlyNow that it’s clear the day of her deathIs of little importance compared to the momentCaught in the photograph as she makes her wayThrough afternoon light like this toward the Seine.The cold rain that fell this morning has given way to sunshine.The gleaming puddles reflect our moodJust as they reflected hers as she stepped around themSmiling to herself, happy that her auditionAn hour before went well. After practicing scalesFor years in a village whose name isn’t recorded,She can study in Paris with one of the masters.No way of telling now how close her lifeCame to the life she hoped for as she rambled,On the day of the photograph, along the quay.But why do I need to know when she herself,If offered a chance to peruse the book of the future,Might shake her head no and turn away?She wants to focus on her afternoon, now almost gone,As we want to focus on ours as we standHere on the bridge she stood on to watchThe steamers push up against the current or ease down.This flickering light on the water as boats pass byIs the flow that many painters have tried to captureWithout holding too still. By the time these boats arriveFar off in the provinces and give up their cargoes,Who knows where the flow may have carried us?But to think now of our leaving is to wrong the moment.We have to be wholly here as she wasIf we want the city that welcomed herTo welcome us as students trained in her schoolTo enjoy the music as much as she didWhen she didn’t grieve that she couldn’t stay
Time steals us all away and leaves photos as proof of existence.
This narrative poem — a dramatic monologue — is teeming with imagery, feeling, and thought. Time, the ephemerality of the moment, Paris, romance, obsession, the flowing Seine, sepia-toned photographs, photography’s power and powerlessness: the group discussed all these things, and more I’m sure.
The speaker is in Paris with his — wife? paramour? friend? — and he knows she is frustrated with him. He’s obsessed with a 19th century photograph they saw in a print shop of a Parisian street scene with a woman carrying a violin case. He can’t stop thinking of the woman, long gone from Paris, faraway from now, and lost to history.
We all could relate to both sides of the poem’s modern-day scenario. On one side of the couple’s dilemma is the seductive power that a photograph has over the narrator (and, by proxy, over us readers). The other side of the dilemma is the “here and now” that the narrator’s companion wants to enjoy while strolling with her man.
Reflecting the narrator’s obsession, the present-day “she” in the poem is barely there. We know much more about the long-gone woman in the photograph. “Enough already,” we imagine the living woman wants to say, but she doesn’t have a voice in the poem. The narrator simply tells us, “She wants to focus on her afternoon, now almost gone.”
But wait! The woman who “wants to focus on her afternoon” is the woman in the old photograph, not the woman in the present. This man cannot stop thinking of that ghost in the image. “Paris is laid out in splendor before you now!” I want to shout at him. “Pay attention to the angel in front of you!” But I cannot reach the inattentive narrator who is just a disembodied “voice” in a poem, just as he cannot reach the woman in a faded image from the 19th century.
Look how he can’t stop himself! He promised — promised! — in the poem’s first line to “focus on the sights before us” rather than on the beguiling antique photograph. “Focus” is what he says — just like a camera does. Perhaps “focus” is not the reassuring word the narrator should have chosen, but it’s honest because his focus keeps returning to the camera’s subject a century earlier. He says he won’t “linger long” on her death, as he clearly already has and proceeds to do some more.
About halfway through the poem, the sun comes out and it seems like our haunted hero is going to come back to the present. He sees how “the gleaming puddles reflect our mood,” and he all but says “honey! I’m home!” But, no, he falls instead through the camera’s time portal back to the muddy puddles that his 19th century inamorata is stepping around as she smiles to herself. At this point in his preoccupation, the narrator exceeds the four corners of the photograph and simply creates unknowable facts about her successful audition and her musical studies.
Just as things are getting a little out of hand, the narrator — and the poem — asks an important question: why does he care what became of his enchantress if she herself, living wholly, didn’t care to “peruse the book of the future”?
Why does he care? What ensnares him? Photography gives us the illusion that we can stop time right — snap! — now. Old photographs let us imagine more fully this vanished place in that vanished time, like the prototypical 1838 photograph of a Paris street, above. They let us meet and look into the eyes of the dead. Haven’t you looked at a photo from, say, Coney Island in the 1920’s and thought “every one of these people is gone”? Or from the 1960’s and wondered “what became of them”?
Time steals us all away and leaves photos as proof of existence.
As if answering the question “why do I care,” the poem now plunges into the river of time with its boats and flickering lights and its Heraclitean flow, never captured in art, that leads who knows where. The narrator is having, perhaps, a mini-Whitmanesque moment, crossing the Seine rather than Crossing Brooklyn Ferry, seeing the same boats the slim brunette saw (“steamers”) and the same flickering lights she saw, and knowing now he must not “wrong the moment.”
When the narrator resurfaces, he knows it is important to be “wholly here.” (“Wholly” is such a perfect word!) Across a century, the woman in old Paris has reminded him that we are here but briefly, like the blink of a camera’s shutter. He comes to see that the city of Paris will “welcome us as students trained in her school/ To enjoy the music as much as she did.” Her school? The Music School of the Holy Here.
So wake up, take your present-day companion’s hand, and watch for puddles.
But there’s a little more to my story about Carl Dennis and Buffalo, New York. Though we might easily have knocked our coffees onto each other’s plaid shirts in the makeshift English Department hallways in, say, 1972, I assumed that 50+ years on, Carl and I had drifted apart to the expected six degrees of separation, or more.
But no, we were a mere two degrees of separation away. Go know! One of the people in the poetry group, Eva, lives in Buffalo. When we read “In Paris” in our group, she said, “Hey, Carl is a neighbor of mine! He lives a couple of houses away.” Wow! So do you know him? “Yeah, of course, but as a neighbor, not as a famous poet.” So cool!
We discussed the poem as a group for a good long time. It felt like we were on that Paris bridge, like we could see the woman in the photograph, like we knew how to be mad at our partners for “wronging the moment” and not being “wholly here” when presence mattered.
But then I pointed out: “look, this poem doesn’t have a period at the end of the last sentence.” It seemed odd to me, and I checked my source for the poem, the Academy of American Poets online. Nope, no period. See for yourself.
What does it mean to leave a poem open-ended like that? Poets don’t do this for no reason, after all. I’m sure I mentioned Emily Dickinson’s defiance of punctuation conventions.
What does the grammatical caesura do in this particular poem?
Does it hint at the continuing, endless nature of Time?
Does it signify something about indeterminacy? but of what? the moment? our relationships?
Are we intended to go back to the start of the poem, like James Joyce made us do in Finnegans Wake (mostly written in Paris!) where the final sentence (“A way a lone a last a loved a long the”) has no period and flows like the River Liffey into the opening sentence (“riverrun, past Eve and Adam’s, from swerve of shore to bend of bay,”)?
I even checked “In Paris” to see if that worked. It does, if you want it to.
Eva said, “I have an idea! I’ll text Carl and ask!” Fantastic! And she did. “Hey, Carl, we’re reading your poem ‘In Paris!’” And he replied something like I can’t believe anybody’s reading that old poem. And she then asked, “what does it mean that there’s no period at the end?”
And much like Marshall McLuhan, he replied, “That’s a mistake. It’s supposed to be there.”
So much for the River Liffey.
Ok, the sepia-toned woman, so busy with living, “didn’t grieve that she couldn’t stay PERIOD.” Got it. Message to the poem’s speaker from two women, one on the bridge now, one there a hundred years ago: when in Paris, be in love or at least be here now. PERIOD.
“In Paris” was published in Dennis’s 1993 poetry collection The Near World. Unlike the poem’s distracted narrator who was focused on the deep past, the poetry group was reading a modern poem written in our lifetimes. But we were like the narrator in one respect: we were enthralled. We were in Paris, and I think we were falling in love with this poem.
And now, weeks after the poetry group discussion, I find myself re-reading Dennis’s poem umpteen times, poring over it like a man staring at a very old photograph while I’m working on this piece. It’s taken all day, and soon my wife and I have somewhere to be. I hear her call from the other room, “It’s time to go. Enough with that poem already!” I am here and it is now and we do have to go.
Because the poem above is exactly what I shared with the group, you’ll note there’s no period at the end. Since I have it on good authority that a period belongs there, I’m duty-bound to offer the correct last line: “When she didn’t grieve that she couldn’t stay.” Ah, so much better!
“In Paris” lead me to Dennis’s books of poetry which are now 14 in total plus one book of essays. I’ve bought several now, including his last, Earthborn. Many colleagues and commenters describe his poetry as thoughtful, sensitive, focused on the everyday, accessible, meditative, humane. All true. But I haven’t found any mention of how funny, how deeply wryly funny, Dennis can be.
In “Primitive,” he refrains from killing a spider in his house in order to avoid the slippery ethical slope toward killing a few people he knows. In “Progressive Health,” he advises healthy organ donors for perfectly ethical reasons not to wait another day before donating their organs. In poems like “Eurydice” and “The God Who Loves You,” you’ll laugh but only to keep from crying. Find them, read them.
The God who loves me whispers that he bets that Carl Dennis likes Groucho Marx and thinks Groucho was a good a preceptor for me in college as any of Carl’s smart colleagues.

Paris is home to the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, the Notre Dame and many more iconic landmarks. It is the city of fashion, haute cuisine and lights. As one of the most popular tourist destinations, it exerts an enormous attraction to people all over the globe: in 2023 it received more international visitors than New York, Bangkok or Mecca.
When we think of Paris, we picture a city with grand boulevards, lined with stately buildings, between which little alleyways meander. Here locals chatter on the outdoor terraces of countless bistros and brasseries while enjoying the culinary delights.
This romantic image of the French capital is true only to some extent. It’s not something the majority of the 11 million inhabitants of the Paris metropolitan area experience in their daily lives. Paris has long outgrown its historic core: most of the people who consider themselves Parisains today live in the city’s suburbs: the banlieues.
The Paris within the Périphérique (the ring road which encircles Paris proper) is world-famous. The suburbs which lay outside it remain mysterious places.
In today’s article, I want to shine a light on Paris’s banlieues: their history, their development and their…

How long do you have to be visiting a city before you start to feel like a local? Or, maybe it has more to do with how you spend your days rather than a length of time. When I spent a week in Paris last year with my best friend, her Apple watch clocked us at about 24,000 steps a day. We did all the usual touristy things: Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Sacre Coeur, the Louvre, etc. But I’ve always longed to visit a foreign city and live like a local instead. Getting to know a city on a deeper level is hard to do when you’re in hardcore tourist mode. So, I decided to pack up my laptop to spend a month working remotely in Paris this summer — with the intention to live like une vrai Parisienne, at least for a little while.
One of my biggest pet peeves is looking like a typical American tourist. It can’t be helped most of the time, but there have been trips where I’ve gone out of my way to avoid it. For example, when I traveled to Turkey for 10 days, I arrived with freshly dyed dark-brown hair and a carefully culled suitcase devoid of sneakers or anything made of denim. Apparently, it worked. A few times, locals spoke to me in Turkish, and a few tourists even stopped me to ask for directions.
This time around, I’m not focused on blending in, especially not clothes-wise. That’s impossible in such a fashion-conscious city filled with genetically chic inhabitants. Besides, I need my comfy shoes. Instead, I want to do more ordinary things to fill my days. Yes, there will be sightseeing on my days off, and of course I will be taking beaucoup photos. But when I walk out the front door of my flat in the 5th arrondissement, I want to “have the air of” a local, as the French would put it.
To me, that means heading to a farmers market to buy the week’s fruits and vegetables, going for a morning run along the Seine, reading Le Monde over my morning coffee, watching French TV, going to a movie theater, listening to French pop music on the radio, reading a book in a park, and cooking myself dinner. I thought about bringing my laptop to a cafe and working there for a few hours, but I’m afraid that it would make me look too American. I’m pretty sure Parisians don’t mix work with pleasure.
I’m hoping that mundane tasks like doing laundry will make me feel more like a local and less like a tourist. I’ll have my own washer and dryer in the flat I’m renting. People don’t usually wash their clothes when they’re staying in hotels, at least not the proper way. My husband admits he once washed his clothes in the dishwasher on a business trip! I’m no better. When I was a teenager, I went on a trip to Europe with my high school, and our first stop was Paris. The bathroom in the hotel room I shared with my friends had a toilet and sink (of course). But it also had this weird “bonus sink” that was lower to the ground and had faucets to turn on hot and cold water. My best guess, being only sixteen, was that it was for washing clothes, so that’s what I did. Not long after, I learned what a bidet was and realized in horror that I had washed my underwear and socks where previous hotel guests had washed their, um, dirty derrières.
Another embarrassing laundry faux pas came only about a decade later while on my honeymoon in Germany and Austria. We were in the alpine city of Salzburg, staying in this lovely hotel recommended by Rick Steves, my favorite travel writer and host of a TV travel show on PBS. We even sported Rick Steves’ official backpacks that I had borrowed from a friend so that we could carry our luggage on our backs like seasoned pros. Well, it didn’t take long for me to get blisters from walking with all that extra weight. When we got to the hotel, I was definitely in the mood to treat myself to a luxury. So, when I saw a white plastic bag hanging in our hotel room closet, I decided to use the hotel’s laundry service instead of washing my socks and underwear in the sink. It wasn’t until I got everything back that I realized it was a dry-cleaning service, not laundry. I was both horrified and oddly impressed at how each pair of socks and underwear was carefully pinned to cardboard and artfully wrapped in tissue paper like little Christmas presents.
Ever since that first trip to Europe as a teenager, I yearned to live abroad someday. I had hopes of being a travel writer like Rick Steves or Bill Bryson and wanted to move to Europe. I also wanted to become fluent in Spanish, a language I had studied in school for eight years but never could master. Alas, none of that was meant to be. But as Edith Piaf would croon: Je ne regrette rien. I regret nothing. I’ve had a fulfilling career as a technical writer for almost 20 years now, and I’ve taken some pretty cool trips, though mostly as a tourist.
Very early in my career, I did have some luck getting a travel article published in my hometown newspaper, the Bristol Pilot. I had decided to do a work abroad program right after college and lived in London for six months on a special visa. After two weeks of pounding the pavements, I landed a job as a receptionist for World Imports, an importer of Mexican beers like Corona and Modelo Negra to the U.K. I had always known that my hometown of Bristol, Pa., was named after Bristol, England, so I decided to take a trip there one Saturday and document my experience. The article was titled “Tales of Another Bristol,” or something like that. It was the only travel article I’ve ever had published.
There was no question about feeling like a local during my London days, that’s for sure. I did mundane things every day. For one, my job as a receptionist was pretty boring. Most of the time I just sat there waiting for the phone to ring. Sometimes I would deliver faxes or make coffee for visitors. A lot of my coworkers spoke Spanish, so to kill time I would practice translating letters and have them check it. Commuting to work was another drag. There were times when I would be running late for work (yet again) all sweaty and out of breath from running for the train, with a big knot in my stomach anticipating getting in trouble by the owner, Alphonso, and I would want to just break down and cry. But I would remind myself that at least I was in London, and that seemed to make it all better.
So, this idea for a 30-day mini adventure in Paris is a small step toward fulfilling a lifelong dream of living abroad, though I’m more into learning French these days than Spanish. In fact, I’ll be attending my twice-weekly French class online while I’m there. With the time difference, it won’t start until midnight! Another adjustment will be my work schedule. I plan to start at 2 p.m. so that I can still make scheduled meetings with my East Coast colleagues, which means I’ll be working into the night. But the upside is I’ll have my mornings free. Also, the sun doesn’t set until 10 p.m. in Paris in the summer, making the days feel longer.
Eventually, I plan to document here on Medium how it all went. Will I feel like a local after only 30 days? Will I get asked for directions while lugging home groceries or doing some other ordinary chore? Will I master the European washer and dryer and other foreign appliances without blowing any fuses? One thing is for certain: If I encounter a vintage bidet somewhere, I’ll know exactly what NOT to do.

Victor Hugo, Marcel Proust, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and many others have captured the essence of Paris in their writing, and numerous poets have used this city as their muse. For artists and creators, Paris is a city of sensations, of layers, of contrasts and defies easy categorisation.
Walking the streets of this city, I felt all the hopes, aspirations and fantasies that are often excluded from my conscious personality in everyday life come alive—the determination never to be disappointed by life, to see only what is beautiful, good and kind.
I had strangers smiling at me and that lively “Bonjourrrr”. I admired Parisians going about their daily lives, running up and down the path beside the Seine. I watched a group of French women having their passionate intellectual debates in a restaurant before going to their yoga class. I watched people wandering through the Sunday flea market in search of the perfect vintage garment. I have admired femininity and the art of true seduction, the very definition of naked couture at a cabaret show, reminiscent of a simpler time when natural beauty was cherished.
For artists who have often felt left out or like they don’t belong because their upbringing or culture doesn’t support the arts or embrace creativity, Paris is a breath of fresh air. Going to a country where the government itself has a history of supporting the arts and culture makes you feel seen and understood.
Sous le ciel de Paris, I was reminded that what I do matters, and for the first time I didn’t feel that my romanticism was being challenged or stifled. I didn’t feel at war with myself.
I felt at peace.

A Data-Backed Travel Guide
After binge-watching Emily in Paris (no judgment, please), I’ve been dying to stroll along the Seine, bite into a flaky croissant, and soak in the city’s magic — art, love, history, the works. But I’m also a data nerd who loves a good deal, so I wasn’t about to splurge on flights.
I gathered flight prices from Singapore (SIN), London (LHR), and New York (JFK) to Paris (CDG) to study travel patterns from different corners of the world — Asia, Europe, and North America — and find the cheapest month to visit Paris in 2025. What I found surprised me: a secret sweet spot where prices drop, crowds thin, and Paris still sparkles — plus a month so overpriced and packed it made me rethink my plans.
Paris reinvents itself with each season, and timing can make or break your trip — especially if you’re budget-conscious. Here’s the quick rundown:
Timing matters because each season shows a different side of Paris — and impacts your wallet.
November is your golden ticket.
Flights from LHR averaged $125, SIN $350, and JFK $300 — the lowest I found all year. Why? It’s late fall in Paris (6–11°C), meaning fewer tourists clogging up the Louvre or the Marais. My price trend plot confirmed it: November was the cheapest across the board. Sure, it’s chilly — pack a scarf and a jacket — but imagine this: you’re sipping hot chocolate by the Seine, golden leaves falling, and you didn’t break the bank to get there. That’s November in Paris.
If November’s too cold for you, consider September to October. My daily price trend plot showed prices stabilizing during this period — before spiking again in late October. Wonder why the stability? Summer’s rush (think families on school break) fades, and demand drops as kids head back to school. September’s still mild (13–21°C), with fewer crowds and scenic fall vibes — perfect for a bike ride along the Canal Saint-Martin. October cools down (9–16°C) but keeps the charm, with autumn colors popping in the Tuileries Garden. Just watch out for late October — prices start creeping up as holiday travel looms.
Here’s the month I’d dodge like a tourist trap: August. My price trend plot showed a steady climb through the month, peaking near the end. Why the spike? It’s peak summer (16–25°C), and Paris is swarming with tourists soaking up the sun. Plus, many Europeans (including Parisians) take their annual holidays, so the city’s packed with visitors while locals escape to the coast. If you hate crowds (and overpaying), August is a hard pass.
My price trend plot revealed a wild ups and downs from June to July. What gives? June is the tail end of shoulder season — still warm (14–23°C), but demand hasn’t peaked. Come July, summer hits full swing: school holidays kick in, Bastille Day (July 14) draws crowds with its parades and fireworks, and Paris becomes the place to be. More demand, higher prices — it’s simple economics, but it stings.
Here’s the deal: book your 2025 Paris trip for November. You’ll save big, enjoy a quieter city, and still get that Parisian magic (pro tip: pack a scarf — it’s chilly).
Have you visited Paris during an off-season month? Did you find hidden deals, or do you think the summer hype is worth it?

On 20th May 2024, our most awaited day was here. It was the first day of our fortnight-long planned package tour of Europe. We covered the following countries- Netherlands, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Italy, Slovenia, Vatican, and Germany for a span of two weeks.
This trip was a result of three months of extensive planning and preparation. There were massive discussions and contradictions within our family on which travel agency should we choose, which itinerary, the budget, VISA appointment, purchasing and much more.
We consulted many relatives, friends, family friends, those who have been on a European trip, and much more. At last, we booked our travel with Soman’s Leisure Tours, Kochi. On 30th April, we had our VISA appointment.
On the 10th we had an online meeting with the tour company explaining the guidelines for the trip. They instructed us about currency, international SIM and much more.
18th, Saturday was the day when we started to put together things. Despite that, we could not have successful progress on that. On the 19th we had to go to our ancestral place hence, it was indeed a tight…

Yayyyy!! Its summer, its vacation time.
This Year we are planning to Visit Paris. ( I’ve already been to Paris though )
This would be the 1st time my wife / kid and my in-laws would visit Paris. I quickly wanted to share with you our 3 day Itenerary.
Paris is a city that is full of history, art, culture, and great food (especially if you are into French cuisine). There is no one perfect itinerary for visiting Paris, but here is a suggested 3-day itinerary that will help you get a taste of the best that the capital of France has to offer:
Day 1:
Day 2:
Day 3:
This itinerary will give you a taste of the best (or the most famous) that Paris has to offer, but there is so much more to see and do in this incredible city.
If you have more time, be sure to explore the lesser-known neighborhoods and attractions. Personally, I like the Catacombs, the Père Lachaise Cemetery (graves of Jim Morrison or Chopin, but also a nice walking area) or just visiting Sunday morning local markets…
Plenty to see and do.
If you had something to take away, add a clap / respond / highlight / follow me and subscribe to get emails as soon as I publish. We all go further when we help each other!”
Cheers — KS !!

I think the way French people say, “Bonjour!” is sensuous. Just two syllables. Or two musical notes, rather.
Shopkeepers, waitstaff, and bartenders all seem to sing when they greet me with “Bonjour!” or “Bonjour, monsieur!”
Nothing about me asks to be serenaded. I’m an older American male of Chinese ethnicity, not immediately charismatic, nor sharply dressed, nor classically good-looking, nor anything. On my better days, I could perhaps pass for an expatriate, but more often, I probably come off as a seasoned tourist, which, at least, is accurate.
Everyone gets this greeting, not just me. But alas, not everyone responds in a way that matches the greeter’s sensuality. They should. We could all use a bit more sensuality in our lives, no matter how small.
I wish to blend in, to “live like a local” as many travelers like to say. So, whenever I’m greeted, I feel the need to respond in kind. Thus, I reply, “Bonjour!” in the best French I can muster, which causes me to mimic that same songlike quality. “Bonjour!” I feel better just saying, er, singing it.
For example, I found myself singing at 9:15 am as I entered La Crémaillère 1900 in Montmartre on a chilly, misty April morning. Still sleepy, and before my morning coffee.
Singing “Bonjour!” in response to the server uplifts me. Sure, it’s only two notes, but it’s two more notes than I sing when I enter a café near my home in New York City.
By the way, I wrote my first draft of this story in this café, and all the photos in this article are of this establishment.
If you must ask, I had the “Pain perdu au caramel beurre salé” or “Salted butter caramel French toast.” Yes, it was as sensuously decadent as that reads.
Some say that “Paris est un village,” and I can see why. Few other large cities I’ve experienced greet me like I’m in a small town, but people here do this naturally.
I found out later that all of French society conspires to do this, not just Parisians. French children are consistently taught to say “bonjour” and “au revoir” to their peers and adults. Some say it’s a way to acknowledge another’s humanity.¹
I live in New York City, where we value efficiency. We can’t be bothered with fussy things like greetings, especially with strangers. Often just a direct, “Do you have the time?” or “I’d like a matcha oat latte, please!”
But is it really that fussy? It’s not like I’m being asked to say, “Good day to you, madame. You look quite well today.” Saying “hello” is only two syllables, just like in French!
I’m resolved to acknowledge my fellow New Yorkers’ humanity when I get home. I will sing “Hello!” to all of them, even if things get awkward. Maybe I’ll get a side job at a café or a Lululemon shop. Just for the practice.
Back in Paris, at bustling, understaffed restaurants, harried servers move quickly and efficiently. They don’t smile. They acknowledge me just long enough to indicate, yes, take any available seat. Maybe I’ll get a menu soon, maybe not.
But I always get a tonally cheerful “Bonjour!” paired with firm, if fleeting, eye contact.
The Middle Eastern immigrants working the kebab stalls greet me with a lilting “Bonjour!” The Chinese housekeeping staff at my hotel: “Bonjour!” Service workers who don’t even seem happy with their jobs, at least at that moment: “Bonjour!”
It’s as if those weary service workers are saying, “I’m unhappy right now, but I’m not taking it out on strangers. And so, I will sing because singing is good for my soul. Even if it’s just two notes.”
And if singing one’s troubles is good for one’s soul, does that mean complaining in French is more therapeutic than complaining in English? I’ve heard people complain in French many times, and it’s the cutest thing ever. I feel cathartic just listening to them, and I don’t even know what they’re saying most of the time!
French certainly sounds better than the flatter tones of my American English. In my home country, I hear the French language’s relative musicality exert its influence.
Does it sound more meaningful to say you’re a “hustler” or an “entrepreneur”? (Bonus: Say “entrepreneur” in proper French, with a crooked half-smile and a gleam in your eye for a self-effacing, satirical effect.)
What feels better to say after you emotionally process a major setback? “That’s life!” versus “C’est la vie!”
If you and your partner want to invite a prospective new lover to your bedroom, would you coquettishly propose a “threesome” or a “ménage à trois”?
I’m not an enraptured newbie à la Emily in Paris. This is my seventh time in Paris. I’ve been to other parts of France. I’m actually a sometimes-jaded traveler. I’ve studied French on and off for years.
While I’ve always loved French culture and people, after all these visits, I’m finally noticing and loving the soulful quality I hear in the French language.
That’s all I have about French greetings. Though, we haven’t discussed French farewells, which I find similarly lyrical. I guess you’ll just have to use your imagination when I say (sing):
Au revoir! Bonne journée!
As mentioned, all photos in this article were shot inside this café:
La Crémaillère 1900 (Yelp, Google Maps)

On November 23rd we embarked on our final trip of 2024 — a long weekend to Paris, France.
It was 5.30 am when we arrived at the train station, wishing that our train would hurry up and whisk us away from the cold, dark, windy platform.
From home to London and from London onto the Eurostar which took us into the centre of Paris.
A short Metro journey later and we were in Montmartre, where we were staying for our 3-night trip.
I couldn’t quite believe that the Basilica was just around the corner from our hotel, but there it was large and splendid in the afternoon sunshine.
Taking the funicular up the steep hill we arrived to amazing views across the Paris skyline. I took the opening photo above from the steps of the Basilica, you can just see the Eiffel Tower in the distance.
Behind the Basilica are lots of ‘olde worlde’ little cobbled streets, so we took a wander. It was a lovely walk through the older parts of Montmartre, but…

There’s an eclectic, egalitarian art gallery hiding in plain sight in Le Marais district in Paris. Its art pieces coexist with the chic boutiques and charming restaurants this area is known for.
Throughout these winding, intimate medieval streets, perched on walls above eye level (or below, sometimes) are street art pieces.
I love finding them amongst the teeming throngs of tourists. So many tourists. But who am I to hate on them? I’m a tourist myself, and I love Le Marais, just like them.
Several years ago, I did a street art tour of this neighborhood. The tour guide told me that residents here tended to be more tolerant of graffiti and street art. Artists, Bohemians, gays/lesbians, and other groups have at times occupied this area since the late 20th century.
I went back this year.
Just like years ago, it did not disappoint.
All photos in this article were taken by me in Le Marais during my April 2025 trip — except for this one below from December 2017, where I actually caught a street artist in the act!!
I’ve done my best to attribute the artworks that I know.
Back to this year.
I discovered this cute piece below.
I wondered if the raccoon stencil was part of the original piece or if another artist added it later. Did the original artist get annoyed or grudgingly accept it?
You had to walk down a nondescript residential street to find this one:
I don’t know why these artists are into vintage video game characters, but I find them cute.
On the left below is Super Mario by Invader (Official website, Instagram). That famous artist of those Space Invaders video game characters rendered as tile art throughout Paris and beyond.
Did you know there’s a FlashInvaders app that lets you “collect” sightings of Invader’s works? It’s totally a thing.
Below is more street art. I love the various forms and mediums this art can take.
Some pieces were stunningly intricate, as shown below. For pieces that clearly require so much effort, I sometimes wonder if artists seek permission from the building owners first or hope that the virtuosity of the piece earns enough respect to spare its destruction.
Le Marais is already delightful with its shopping, food, and vibes. You would not be faulted for enjoying only these things.
But there’s a playful, subversive layer if you slow down and look closely enough.
Next time you’re here, let your gaze wander more.
Or take a detour down that nondescript alley.
You may be rewarded with some artistic surprises!

“When you make a decision as a mayor, you immediately see positive and negative effects.” says Ms Anne Hidalgo, Mayor Paris
Since becoming the first female Mayor of Paris in 2014, Anne Hidalgo has championed an ambitious vision to make the French capital a global leader in sustainability and urban environmental innovation. Her policies, rooted in combating climate change and enhancing the quality of life for Parisians, have reshaped the city’s landscape, reduced its ecological footprint, and set a benchmark for cities worldwide. Hidalgo’s work reflects a commitment to nature, social equity, and a forward-thinking approach to urban living, earning her international acclaim, including a spot on TIME’s 2024 TIME100 Climate list. This article explores her transformative efforts to foster a greener Paris and secure a better future for its residents.
A Vision for a Greener Paris
Hidalgo’s tenure has been defined by bold environmental policies aimed at reducing pollution, prioritizing sustainable mobility, and reintegrating nature into urban spaces. Her overarching goal is to make Paris a “15-minute city,” where essential services—shops, schools, workplaces, and green spaces—are accessible within a short walk or bike ride. This concept, championed by Hidalgo and urban planner Carlos Moreno, seeks to reduce car dependency, enhance community living, and mitigate climate impacts.
Her initiatives reflect a holistic approach to urban planning, balancing ecological resilience with social inclusion.
Revolutionizing Urban Mobility
One of Hidalgo’s most transformative achievements has been her push to reduce car dominance in Paris, a city historically shaped by automotive culture. Since 2014, her administration has added over 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) of bike lanes, making cycling a viable and safe option for commuters. The “Plan Vélo” initiative has expanded cycling infrastructure, with dedicated lanes and bike-sharing schemes like Vélib’ becoming integral to Parisian life. Posts on X highlight the scale of this transformation, noting that Paris has built “+800km new bike paths” and reduced car traffic by 40% under Hidalgo’s leadership.
Hidalgo has also pedestrianized key areas, transforming the Seine riverbanks into car-free zones reserved for walkers and cyclists. The “Paris Respire” (Paris Breathes) initiative bans traffic in certain areas on Sundays and holidays, encouraging residents to reclaim public spaces. Major roads, including stretches along the Seine and iconic plazas like Bastille and Nation, have been redesigned to prioritize pedestrians and public transport. These efforts have led to a 40% drop in air pollution since 2014, significantly improving environmental health.
To further deter car use, Hidalgo introduced policies targeting high-polluting vehicles. Diesel vehicles have been banned from Paris by 2024, with all fossil fuel vehicles phased out by 2030. A parking tax on gas-guzzling SUVs and mandatory emissions stickers for cars entering the city reinforces these measures. These policies not only reduce emissions but also incentivize cleaner transport alternatives, aligning with Paris’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.
Greening the Urban Landscape
Hidalgo’s commitment to nature is evident in her ambitious tree-planting and urban greening programs. Since taking office, Paris has planted over 200,000 trees, with a pledge to add 170,000 more by 2026. Urban forests are being created near landmarks like the Hôtel de Ville, Gare de Lyon, and Opéra Garnier, with plans to cover 50% of the city with planted areas by 2030. A notable project is the transformation of the area from the Trocadéro to the Eiffel Tower into a 56-hectares wooded park, set to become a “green lung” for the city.
In 2022, Hidalgo announced plans for a 3.5-hectare urban forest in the 20th arrondissement, planting over 2,000 trees to combat heatwaves and enhance biodiversity. Her administration has also relaxed building codes to encourage residents to plant trees in their neighborhoods, fostering community-driven greening. These efforts address urban heat island effects, with Paris preparing for projected heatwaves exceeding 50°C (120°F) in coming decades.
Hidalgo’s vision extends to iconic landmarks. The Champs-Élysées, one of the world’s most famous avenues, is being reimagined as a “fantastic garden” by 2030, with wider sidewalks, more trees, and reduced car lanes. These projects not only enhance Paris’s aesthetic appeal but also improve air quality and urban resilience.
Making the Seine Swimmable
A hallmark of Hidalgo’s environmental legacy is her commitment to cleaning the Seine River, a symbolic and practical endeavor. Decades of pollution rendered the Seine unsafe for swimming, but Hidalgo promised to make it swimmable by the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Her administration invested heavily in wastewater treatment and stormwater management, resulting in a cleaner river. In July 2024, Hidalgo herself swam in the Seine to demonstrate its safety, a highly publicized moment that underscores her commitment to environmental progress.
The Olympics provided a platform to showcase sustainable urban practices. Temporary venues minimized new construction, single-use plastics were restricted, and equipment was redistributed for reuse. These efforts halved emissions compared to the 2012 London Olympics, aligning with Paris’s carbon-neutral ambitions.
Global Leadership in Climate Action
Hidalgo’s influence extends beyond Paris through her roles in global climate networks. As chair of C40 Cities from 2016 to 2019, she advocated for urban climate leadership, emphasizing the role of cities in meeting Paris Agreement goals. In 2023, she was appointed a Global Ambassador for the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy, where she pushes for city-level climate financing and ambitious emissions targets. Her work with figures like Michael Bloomberg and other mayors has fostered international collaboration on green policies.
Hidalgo’s leadership during the 2015 COP21 summit, where the Paris Agreement was adopted, cemented her reputation as a climate advocate. She co-hosted the Climate Summit for Local Leaders, empowering cities to set bold emissions targets. Her global advocacy underscores her belief that local actions drive systemic change, a principle reflected in Paris’s recognition with a UN Climate Action Award at COP26.
Visionary Leader
Ms Hidalgo argues that her policies, though polarizing, are necessary to address the climate crisis, a stance echoed by supporters like the former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who called her a “visionary leader.”
A Legacy for the Future
Her decade-long tenure has left an indelible mark on Paris, transforming it into a model of sustainable urban living. From reducing emissions by 25% between 2004 and 2018 to creating 45 kilometers of new parks and 180 car-free “school streets,” Hidalgo’s policies have prioritised nature and human-centric urban design.
Her work has inspired cities globally, proving that bold local action can address planetary challenges. As Paris prepares for a future of climate resilience, Hidalgo’s legacy—bike-filled streets, verdant parks, and a swimmable Seine—stands as a testament to her unwavering commitment to nature and a better future. In her words, “We have to dare, because tomorrow it will be too late.
Regards and a respectful salute to this great Climate Leader and Citizen Of Mother Earth, Ms Anne Hidalgo. It is because of the climate action by world citizens and leaders like you, life on Earth is safe for all living beings.

Before I moved to France, I used to think that French people were arrogant about their food.
Now that I’ve lived here for almost four years, I ‘now’ think that French people are very arrogant about their food.
It’s not that people here aren’t open to other cuisines. Heck, they seem to rate Italian and Japanese food pretty highly.
And it’s not that people from other countries don’t hold supremacist views of their own — at least as far as food is concerned.
But when it comes to questions about culinary sophistication, French people, by and large, take it as self-evident that French food is in a league of its own.
In a country where everything is subject to debate, questions as to French food’s superiority remain, ironically, off the table.
I’m painting in broad strokes, of course; not everyone thinks this way. But given how many times I’ve been privy to French people talking merde about other cuisines, I feel pretty confident about making this claim.
Make no mistake — I love France and the French people. It’s just that French arrogance about food is a tad annoying.

Prior to parenthood, I lived in Paris, married a Frenchman, and enjoyed la bonne vie in our 12th arrondissement neighborhood between the Bastille and the Gare De Lyon. I buffed up my French, eked out a living writing and leading walking tours, and frittered away many a glorious day in open-air markets, museums, and cafes. Then came a move to America after several years in France, and before I knew it, ten years had passed without a trip back to my favorite city. I decided that the time had come to rediscover Paris — and that my young daughter would make a perfect traveling companion. Not that Camille would be inclined to spend hours admiring Picassos or sampling French cuisine. Like many kids, she pooh-poohs art museums and “weird” food. Rather, her raison d’etre in Paris was to rocket to the top of the Eiffel Tower. So, with that in mind, we kissed Dad goodbye, reiterated cat-care instructions, and set out to spend two weeks in France.
My mission when traveling long distances with my daughter is to plan activities that she will look forward to, then have a backup in case Plan A unravels. During our first days in Paris, we stuck close to our flat in the 2nd arrondissement and saved exuberant excursions for the mornings, when we had more stamina. We began with a 10-minute walk to the Centre Georges Pompidou, also known as Beaubourg.
“Pompidou! Is there really someone named Pompidou?” giggled Camille, gaping at one of the three most widely visited cultural site in the France.
“Of course,” I replied. “Pompidou was a French president who liked modern art.”
“Is that modern art?” she gasped, staring at the tangle of pipes and tubes looming above our heads.
People flock to Beaubourg for various reasons–the mishmash of modern architecture, the dance and theatrical spaces, the cavernous modern art museum on the fourth floor–but foremost, it is a fine family venue. Admission is free for kids, and there is plenty of room to move around, with a stew of mimes, musicians, jugglers, and portrait artists to entertain everyone standing in line. Our favorite part of the visit, though, was the panoramic view from Pompidou’s glass escalator.
“There it is, Mom,” shouted Camille, spotting the Eiffel Tower.
“And over there is Notre Dame and Quasimodo’s bell tower,” I pointed out as I thought about lunch. Because of the time change, Camille and I always seemed to be hungry. Outside, we grabbed two seats at one of the creperies surrounding the Fontaine Stravinsky, which boasts an array of whimsical figures that spiral and spit water in the air.
Feeling very French, I ordered a salmon crepe for me and a sugar one for Camille.
“What’s that?” cried my daughter, glaring at the thin, speckled brown pancake being placed in front of her. “It’s not like the crepes we eat at home!”
“It’s a French buckwheat crepe from Brittany,” I explained.
“I don’t like it, Mom. It looks strange.”
In a city where food is art, eating would become our biggest challenge. A litany of complaints accompanied each meal: The cheese smelled like bad breath, the mustard was the wrong shade of yellow, and the crème fraÎche wasn’t real whipped cream.
“Eat,” I implored, sounding like my mother. “There is no better food on the planet than here.”
After the crepe meltdown, we agreed on a culinary compromise, starting with croissants and cocoa for breakfast. Two blocks from our flat, we hit the croissant jackpot on rue Montorgueil. This cobblestone lane is a quintessential slice of French life. Vendors proudly hawk pretty produce from wooden carts as Frenchmen, heads buried behind Le Monde, sip thimble-size cups of coffee at sidewalk cafes. The bonus on the block, though, is La Pâtissier Stohrer, the oldest family bakery in Paris, boasting crusty croissants that are considered by many the best in the city.
Lines! If the Guinness Book of Long Lines existed, the Eiffel Tour would top the chart. Rain or shine, there’s always a huge crowd winding around the tower.
“Achh,” I groaned the afternoon we visited, calculating the four-hour wait.
“Forget the elevator, Mom,” said Camille. “Let’s climb to the top. It’s a shorter line.”
It certainly was: Forty-five minutes later, we were on our way up the mighty monument. “Ooh la la, look at Paris!” I exclaimed as we arrived at the tower’s second tier, mercifully the maximum for climbers. Feeling giddy, we took turns taking pictures in every direction.
The next day, we set out to find what my hometown newspaper calls “the best crepes in Paris.” On rue Cler in the 7th arrondissement, we joined a gaggle of crepe aficionados and watched a monsieur drop dollops of ivory batter onto a grill. Thirty seconds later, he flipped the bubbling batter and slathered it with chocolate. “Now these are real crepes,” said Camille, licking her fingers.
To get around, we purchased a Paris Visite card for unlimited bus and metro travel. The metro sprints across Paris as quickly as one can take a shower, but with a drawback: It’s underground, passing below all the sights we came to Paris to see. So, we reserved the metro for night outings or when we were in a hurry and otherwise crisscrossed Paris on city buses.
In the five years I lived in the city, I managed to avoid the Bateaux Mouches, a one-hour boat excursion that glides through the Seine with an invisible guide who booms out information about historical sights over a loudspeaker. Camille couldn’t wait to board the boat with the rest of the romantics and tourists. Afterward, we agreed it’s the fastest and coolest way to see Paris.
Eight is a grand age for kids to discover the world. They’re not tied to a parent’s hip, and they make friends easily. They’re curious and energetic, and anything new is still cool. But that doesn’t mean every day is hunky dory, even in Paris. One big challenge I faced in traveling solo with my daughter was finding moments when we could each relax in our own way. After a week on the go, tempers frayed. I reigned in the sightseeing and changed tactics, letting Camille sleep late while I savored coffee on the balcony. We discovered small playgrounds filled with children. Ultimately, I indulged my daughter in some of my favorite French frivolities.
Our feet were first on the list. Finding the perfect pair of red tennis shoes on the rue de Rivoli swallowed a chunk of one day, so afterward we skipped lunch and ordered two banana splits in the first cafe we spied along the Seine. Our most exciting moments were similarly unexpected and often free: puppeteers and musicians performing on stone bridges, skateboard competitions near monuments, and watching the Eiffel Tower light up the night like a trillion twinkling stars. One afternoon, we peeked into the pyramid at the Louvre, made a wish, picnicked in the Jardin des Tuileries, rode the Ferris wheel there three times, and conked out by 9 p.m.
We reserved one day for a country outing and chose Monet’s gardens in Giverny, arriving before the crowds on an early train. We loved the lemon-colored lilies cloaking the ponds, the family photos inside Monet’s house, and the tiny tearoom in town.
Suddenly, our days in Paris were dwindling. Sitting along the Seine savoring mango ice cream cones, we mapped out our last adventure: the five-story museum of science and technology at La Villette, which houses a planetarium, greenhouse, submarine, Géode, and more hands-on treasures than we could possibly experience in a day. The fluorescent anatomy section, lighting up the circulatory system, was my favorite. Camille preferred broadcasting a weather report from the museum’s television studio. I found the old-fashioned waterwheel illustrating the relationship between energy and water clever, and Camille gave the greenhouse rave reviews.
On our last night in France, we donned snazzy duds and our new shoes, took the metro to the Left Bank, and devoured a pizza in an outdoor restaurant on Boulevard Saint Germain. We topped off the evening with dessert at Deux Magots, the famous cafe where Simone de Beauvoir and Sartre often sat. It was here that Camille made her confession: “I love Paris, Mom, and I’d love to come with you again. There’s just one problem said my bilingual daughter : I don’t think anyone here understands you, because you speak really bad French!”
“You’re kidding!” I said in my best French. C’est pas vrai!

A few years ago, sometime in late 2022, I moved to France. Paris, to be exact.
I had just been accepted into the American University of Paris. The pandemic was winding down finally, the world was opening up and I decided that I wanted to take a leap of faith and move abroad for a few years.
Like a lot of young Americans, I was deeply convinced that life in Europe — France, to be exact — was going to be a better experience for me than back home. Looking back now I can see my naïvety from a mile away but, to be fair, I had been raised on years of positive, effusive press which often overlooks the dark side of living in Europe, the less-than-ideal reality of France, and my own family members’ longing(s) to escape the United States.
My first year or so in Paris were great, and fun. It was admittedly nice to be outside my comfort zone, in a place I wasn’t really all that familiar with, in a city I had only ever vacationed in. But as I began to “settle” into the city, I felt this lingering sense of discomfort start crawling over me. My first Parisian apartment, in the 7th, so close to the Eiffel Tower I could practically see it from my window, started to feel like an isolating prison. I felt frustrated, depressed, and mind-numbingly bored, but I wasn’t entirely sure if it was just stress from my studies or something else coming up to the surface. I think in many ways I was afraid to acknowledge the truth.
Then my mother died unexpectedly from cancer in the spring of 2024 and my life changed overnight. Home in the States for a few months dealing with her affairs, I had a lot of time to think about my life so far and whether or not I was truly following the right path.
The answer to that was a very resounding NO.
So, I made the painful but necessary decision to move back home, back to the United States, back where I really belong.
France was an okay experience, but it was not really all that people crack it up to be. There was only so much of France and Europe I think one can take before you eventually want to melt into a puddle, cease existing. I tried so hard to “fit into” a culture that would never accept me, never see me for who I really was, that inevitably I was beginning to crack and fall apart. And I tried, very hard, even after my mom died to make it work, but one day I woke up and realized I couldn’t do it anymore. I had to leave, go home, and put my life back together correctly.
Paris is beautiful, yes, but its beauty is, I came to realize, a kind of stifling and suffocating, pretentious, superficiality. When you first move here, it’s glorious to see old Haussmanian apartments towering above you, all in various shades of black and gray, especially when coming from American suburbia. But eventually, you start to notice the decay and depressive energy emanating from these blocks of grubby cement and stone — you see greenish mildew oozing from cracks in buildings, French doors moldering in the corners, rust chewing away at the fancy black banisters. Walking along the wide boulevards is both a dream and a nightmare, because the moment you turn down a corner you inevitably spend the majority of your time hopscotching over poopy pies (most canine but not all), puddles of fresh stinking ochre urine, and other nasty icky things like discarded underwear and who knows what else.
The food here eventually began to drive me crazy. Repetitive, bland, and boring, I began to crave, desperately, a plate of sizzling hot Thai stir fry with basil and chilis and onions and garlic. Or a delicious juicy burger with beef that tastes sweetly of grass and sunshine and not sweat and ammonia, melting in your mouth as opposed to becoming a chewy, grainy mess between your teeth. I missed the variety of produce and snacks at my local Albertsons grocery store, apples like jewels and luscious greens just beckoning to be chopped into stew, being able to make pretty much any dish I could possible think of without having to run around half of Paris to find a tiny bit of garam masala. And don’t even get me started on things like pickles. What do the French have against salty, crunchy, vinegary pickles? I hate those little petite cornichons with their mushy texture and sickly sweet aroma. Of course I could make them, as my grandmother showed me how well enough, but in my middling Parisian kitchen, it was hard to find space to fit a jar of cucumbers, mellowing away in their salted brine, amongst all the other shit I inevitably accumulated. It’s not a crime to want for convenience or simplicity; sometimes, all I wanted was to come home after a long day of classes, papers, and exams to a simple and delicious meal without feeling like I was trapped between McDonald’s and pasta in my choices.
And every time I left Paris for more than a month, I would come back feeling as though the city somehow became a little worse off than before. A little poorer, darker, more negative, less appealing. I think Parisians would like to imagine themselves a living in a bustling metropolis, à la New York, which I find laughable having recently been in NYC myself. Paris is nothing like New York, or London, or even Tokyo or Shanghai or Los Angeles. Even fucking Toronto is more interesting than Paris.
Paris is, at best, a glorified village — it has all the feelings of one, too. Twee and pretentious and conservative in all the wrong ways, clinging to traditions that no one cares about, turning its nose up at innovation and change as though its a crime to experiment and be creative. I found it ironic that in New York, I felt as though I could breathe. Not necessarily because the air was better, but simply because I felt like I could just be myself. No stares as I went about my day alone as apparently, being a single woman without a man or a friend in tow is somehow scandalous (who knew). No funny looks when wearing something other than the usual scarf + nappy old coat combo (the horror). Not having to glower at people over my shoulder as they clip my heels walking at super-sonic speeds down narrow and uneven streets, all to inevitably turn into a smoke shop or some coffeehouse to stand around and do nothing. Not feeling as though I need to explain, or justify my existence to anyone, or anything.
Plus, I’ve had some pretty hair-raising experiences in regards to crime and general grubby, scummy behavior that have made simple things like getting a taxi or even walking down the street more anxiety inducing than I think they need be. Of course we should always practice vigilance wherever we go, but I think when it gets to point you always feel a kind of simmering nervousness about innocent people walking behind you or second-guessing whether or not your taxi driver might pull a fast one on you, something is obviously wrong. Tourists and locals laugh off the crime (and its increase) as though it was funny and quirky but deep down, again, everyone knows it’s not a good sign. Not just now but of the state of things to come.
I haven’t even touched on the racism, the prejudices you inevitably run into, the rampant xenophobia, particularly towards Americans, which begins to weigh on your psyche. As expats/immigrants, we’re given a litany of things (literally! my university would often send lists out) we can’t do in Paris, or else. You try your very best to “fit in” and assimilate, but eventually it gets to the point where you’re just dimming your light to satisfy someone else’s mediocrity, and it actually made me angry a little. Why does everyone need to conform, go along with the crowd, not stand out, not be an individual? Have an opinion that isn’t like Jacques or Emilie’s, which also happens to be the same opinion of nearly every other person you meet? Why is it a crime to smile widely, laugh heartily, or feel passionately? I am not interested in living life in muted sepia tones all day every day, sorry! And trying to make connections with other expats was a nightmare in and of itself: I could never accept the habitual mistreatment, backhanded comments, two faced behavior, cattiness, and other bull that many American expats often put up with just to be accepted by Parisians and, in general, the French and many other Europeans. After about the second time of some random nobody making incredibly offensive and often racist personal digs at me, my intelligence, or my appearance, I had to call it quits.
I could go on, but the gist of things is…I eventually came to appreciate America more than I did when I first left. I missed all the wonderful things about this country we take for granted — our humor, our food, our culture, our nature, everything. I missed the deep, deep blue skies of California, the diversity of cities like New York and Los Angeles, the beauty of states such as Wyoming or Montana. I missed the smell of the desert and the sea mingling in the air in downtown LA, the sweet humid perfume of the bayou in deep country Louisiana where my relatives live. I even missed our shitty politicians, our goofiness, our earnestness. I missed it all, so, so much, in a way that it was almost like a hunger. I longed for all those experiences, the history, and my connection it. I realized I was fine with being “American”, and all the good and bad connotations that come along with it. I don’t have time or the energy anymore after my mom’s death to care so much about putting on airs or trying to pretend to be something I am not. Take it or leave it, it’s who I am and will always be.
Of course it took me running away for a while to see it again.

First of all, before somebody complains, yes, France is not Paris. I am writing this as somebody who spends his time in Paris which is currently my equivalent to France.
After one week spent at the home of a friend in Chatou I moved out to have more chances discovering Paris and specifically Paris in the evening and taking care for myself. Frankly spoken, the second week (or first week after leaving my friend’s home), I spent at a hotel (Hipotel Paris Gambetta République, 20. Arr., 236 Rue des Pyrénées, 75020 Paris), so there’s not much about caring for yourself with cooking, cleaning and co.
The hotel I booked wasn’t luxurious nor exclusive. But it was charming and so was the neighborhood. And it gave me a first glimpse of what life is like there. The Rue des Pyrénées in the 20th Arrondissement is a nice street. Crowded, vibrant, and welcoming. When I left the hotel, everything you need to live was available in a radius of a five-minute walk.
In the area I had four supermarkets (supermarché like Carrefour City, Franprix, U Express, Picard for frozen products and other, smaller ones), bars and restaurants, stores (magasins) for e.g. fruits and vegetables, bakeries (boulangeries), butchers (boucheries), laundries (laveries), post offices, police, hospital, an elementary school (ecole) and so on.
My hotel provided a water heater for tee (and probably soups). So, without a kitchen, I used to go out dining. This, you can imagine, is not always cheap. But it was a way to discover different cuisines if it was halal.
Among others I visited an Indian restaurant, Sohna Punjab. It has been the first time I ever visited an Indian restaurant and I don’t regret it. I like spicy food and Sohna Punjab had spicy food. It was tasty and filling. Other restaurants I visited were a Turkish pizzeria and a Turkish diner across the street. Many Turkish restaurants, right? Right. I enjoy Turkish food.
Of course I didn’t just eat. I used to walk around to discover Paris. And I wasn’t looking for main attractions, but for the city itself. During my first week in Chatou, I saw the suburbs of what I would say was the middle-class or upper middle-class. Now it was about Paris itself. I most of the time walked in the 20th, 19th, 10th and 12th arrondissement.
Of course, I did it partly with my bicycle, even though I didn’t ride as often as I planned. This, I hope, is about to change.
Did I go shopping? Did I spend money on souvenirs? No, I didn’t. Apart from the fact that for future travel I don’t need more weight in my luggage, I had no interest in getting more plastics or decoration to stuff my future home. What I’ve bought was a magnet for my cousin. She loves magnets and so I got her one when I — you guessed right — discovered Paris and — right again — went to a restaurant (right, Turkish).
You can walk miles and miles in Paris. You surely don’t have to. Paris offers a lot of busses, trains and subways (Metro). But I barely use them if there’s no need to. I prefer walking, with my rucksack (sac a dos) on my back. Or, of course, with my bicycle. As I have already said, I didn’t spend as much time on riding, so I only rode the bike from Chatou to the 20th Arrondissement and then, later, I cruised a bit more than 11 kilometers in the 20ths.
And this is not all. Before moving to the new apartment, I used to visit Montmartre. Montmartre is a neighborhood in the 18th arrondissement, in the shadow of the church Sacre Coeur. I went there by using my feet. This is why I walked through areas surrounding the Garre de Nord. In some guides people say these areas were the most dangerous ones in Paris. When I’ve been walking in these areas, I didn’t feel threatened, but I realized that it was dirtier, poorer. It was the Paris you don’t see often in travel reports.
The contrast between the tourist hotspot Sacre Coeur and Montmartre (which lost the charm of an artist neighborhood to an overpriced tourism hotspot) couldn’t be wider. Souvenir shops, all selling the same stuff, and diners and restaurants selling over-sugared food, are welcoming tourists looking for a nice snapshot of Paris. I don’t blame the tourists, but the attractiveness of the city, I assume, is changing the identity of a city to please them with food (yes, I ate Turkish often, you’re right) which makes you feel that the city turns into a funfair. Despite that, I like Paris. And this is the reason, why I extended my stay in the city.
If you want to read more about my stay in Paris, visit my profile again. More posts are being published in the future. In the next article I will talk about living in the 17th Arrondissement, the Champs-Elysees, the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower at night.

I was 32 years old when I got the email that brought me to France. By then the course of my life looked pretty much circumscribed. Like many English people I spoke no foreign languages, and there was little to indicate that I would one day live abroad, apart from a taste for subtitled films, croissants and novels in translation.
Weekday mornings I took the Tube to my mildly enjoyable job at an advertising trade magazine, picking up a copy of The Times to read along the way. At weekends I ate pub lunches and ambled in the park and spent hours buried in the Sunday papers, just like everyone else. True, I travelled quite a bit — but nobody asked me to stay.
Then it came, out of the blue. A mail from somebody called François. I wish I’d kept it — but no. Still, the essence of it was: “We’re launching an English-language magazine in Paris and we’re looking for an editor. Your name has come up. Interested?”
Long story short, I moved to Paris.
I arrived on the day before my birthday, so the date is easy to remember. Today, the day I’m writing this post, marks my 20th year here. And I can tell you, it’s gone by in a flash. Yet so much has happened: love, marriage, a son, changes of address and changes of fortune.
But that’s not why you’re here. What you want to know is: how does living abroad for so long change you as a person?
In essence, I think, you keep the best of your homeland and jettison the rest. And you’re also free to adopt the most appealing aspects of your new home and pretty much ignore everything else.
Becoming Franglais
Let’s start with England. I kept the sense of humour — that was a given. I also retain an old-fashioned sense of courtesy. I’m chatty yet respectful with waiters, taxi drivers, store security guards, shop assistants…everyone, in fact. My (French) wife often remarks on how polite I am on public transport — not a very Parisian characteristic. My colleagues tell me I’m “a gentleman”. But this comes with a wariness of causing offence that can prevent me from speaking my mind — something my wife feels is tantamount to hypocrisy. “Is that your real answer?” she’ll say, after asking my opinion. “Or your English answer?”
I kept a whole roster of English-language films and books and poems that remain dear to me. And I still don’t mind the rain.
I lost my patriotism. I was never xenophobic, but learning another language has definitely made me more open. I recall stating quite often that London was the greatest city in the world, but I’ve revised that opinion. We all know where the “Britain is best” attitude led. Living in France has enabled me to understand the cultural jigsaw puzzle of Europe and see Britain’s place in it. When that piece went missing, I was appalled.
Yet at the same time, I wasn’t entirely surprised. There is a yobbish, jingoistic subculture in the UK that has always scared and disgusted me. Those groups of drunken young men stumbling around town on Saturday nights. I was delighted to leave them behind. Along with football. “Soccer”, if you prefer. The first conversational gambit of almost every British male. No, I don’t support a team. No, I didn’t see the match. And no, I’m really not interested in talking about it.
Food, now that’s interesting. It doesn’t take a French person long to get onto the subject — and I’ve become like them. I can hold my own on the wine front, too. In fact I’ve become addicted to bistros and brasseries, and a basket of bread with every meal.
But there’s also a particular sort of family meal here. It’s long and garrulous, with many courses and lots of debate, some of it heated. After my first dinner with my now-wife’s family, I asked her in amazement: “Do you always speak to your parents like that?”
Living in France has taught me a different way of being a family member. Be close. Be present. Show affection. We have dinner with Géraldine’s parents every Saturday — something I would never have imagined doing with my own parents, still less my partner’s.
Joie de vivre, actually
I’ve developed a different relationship to work and money. Back in London, people worked hard. They arrived at work early, they grafted, their lunch was often a sandwich at their desk. I respected them for that. Living in London is expensive, and you have to earn your keep. You can always de-stress in the pub at night.
In Paris it’s different. It irritated me at first. In my neighbourhood I’d try to go to the bank and the dry cleaner at lunchtime — and they were shut. The sandwiches on sale in supermarkets and even boulangeries were surprisingly bland: there’s only so much ham and cheese you can eat. The restaurants and the café terraces, on the other hand, were packed. What was it with these people? Didn’t they have work to do?
Yes, they did. But they also had lives to live. Friends to see. Small pleasures to enjoy. In general — and I’ve just checked this with my wife — French people are suspicious of the rich and bemused by workaholics. They are not lazy. But they don’t put work and money at the centre of their lives. One day, I got that. So instead of complaining, I decided to try their approach. The next day I was sitting on a café terrace at lunchtime, eating fillet of salmon with ratatouille and sipping a glass of rosé. I returned to work happy and motivated. I’m sorry, but the French have totally won lunchtime.
Emotionally, as well, I’ve become a little more French. I’m less afraid to show sadness, or anger — or even, indeed, fear. I’m no longer convinced that a stiff upper lip is the best expression to adopt.
I’ve also come to understand the concept of loyalty, which felt somewhat abstract back home. French people don’t have the easy familiarity of Americans, or the chirpy amiability of Brits, but once they decide that you’re a friend, they’re in it for life. Restaurants here work in a similar way, oddly enough. You know that waiter you considered aloof and cold? Go back the next night. Then the night after that. He’ll soon warm up. There are restaurants in Paris where I’m practically welcomed with open arms. Because I showed loyalty.
Paris, of course, is all about style. My wife thinks my personal style comes from England, as it leans heavily into tweed jackets or blazers, shirts with cufflinks and well-polished brogues. But the truth is that being an Englishman in Paris has accentuated that style. Paris gave me the urge to dress up — England gave me the building blocks. Plus in summer I love a stripy mariner’s T-shirt, which is totally français.
Talking of birthdays, there’s one thing I do that my wife tells me is very English. I send cards. Birthday, Christmas, Valentine’s…you name it. I take pride in selecting the prettiest ones. But they’re not so easy to find here, so I stock up when I’m in London.
Perhaps, in the end, that’s why I chose to settle in Paris. Culturally, it’s very different to the UK. But it’s also only a two and a half hours away by Eurostar. I really can have the best of both worlds.

In 2009, I left North America for the first time, to visit a place I had longed to see my whole life: Paris. Unlike most people I know, I didn’t imagine walking the streets wearing a beret with a baguette tucked beneath my arm. I didn’t care about visiting the pâtisseries or buying expensive, designer clothing. I wasn’t particularly interested in the museums, either.
There was one thing there that I had to see, above all else: Notre-Dame.
I can’t really explain this. I could give you a million reasons, though none fully illuminate this deep connection I have to a building I had never seen before.
For instance, I love its architecture. The flying buttresses are so beautiful, just looking at them makes my chest hurt. Then there are the gargoyles, so fiery and pagan, a strange juxtaposition to such a dignified edifice of the Catholic tradition. Then there are the rib vaults of the nave, the elegant spire, the gallery of the kings on the west façade, and of course, the beatific rose window. Its grandeur is so overwhelming to me, this building that has been standing for 857 years.

(Originally written in January, 2021)
In Netflix’s new show Emily in Paris, a young woman moves to Paris from Chicago to work at a fashion PR firm and finds success leveraging experiential and influencer campaigns for her clients. As I binge watched the first season, I couldn’t help but notice how non-traditional marketing ideas were central to the storylines. While the show exaggerates reality a lot, it also makes a statement about marketing and advertising; experiential and influencer marketing tactics are the most effective ways for brands to authentically connect with audiences. Below are some of the most memorable examples of non-traditional marketing from the first season of Emily in Paris, along with some relevant real world examples for reference.
Interactive Installations (Episode 5)
In this episode, Emily’s boss Sylvie makes a pitch to Hästens, a Swedish luxury bed company, but the client is not impressed with her traditional marketing idea. Emily then pitches her idea for an interactive campaign showing the beds at well-known Paris locations. The client likes her idea and Emily to activates a “social media installation” at La Place Dalida, placing the bed on the street for audiences to engage with and share on their social channels. Emily’s idea is reminiscent of one of my favorite IKEA activations from back in 2013 when the brand turned billboards into real bathrooms, complete with actors brushing their teeth and styling their hair at Paris’ Saint Lazare train station. You can read about it in this article on The Drum.
Introducing Brand Rituals (Episode 8)
In this episode Emily’s friend Mindy has friends visiting from China. When they are out partying, they celebrate by spraying each other with expensive champagne. Emily is inspired and, when she has the opportunity to pitch a potential new vineyard client, suggests they create a new ritual with their surplus of champaign. Her idea is that the vineyard should create a sub brand of Champagne that is exclusively promoted for spraying and can become the “Spray of Paris.” Emily’s idea of a brand creating or endorsing a ritual around their products has proven to be effective popularized by the Ice Bucket Challenge to promote awareness for ALS. Similarly Getting Iced is a ritual created to encourage drinking Smirnoff Ice.
Guerrilla PR Stunts (Episodes 9 and 10)
In episode 9, two avante-garde fashion designers who go by the name Grey Space show up to the AFL auction to bid on a dress that Emily is modeling. They proceed to pull off a publicity stunt by shooting her with paint and shocking the audience in the middle of the show. This concept is reminiscent of Banksy’s self shredding artwork at Sotheby’s last year, and shows the strength of leveraging a live stunt to generate press and talk value.
In episode 10, Pierre returns the favor to Grey Space by creating a PR stunt of his own, hijacking the outside of his former venue and presenting his new collection directly on the street in the middle of a crowd. The audience loves it, and his disruptive stunt goes viral making him the toast of Fashion Week. Pierre’s approach in this episode is reminiscent of more immersive fashion shows that have become popular over the past few years and demonstrate how more experiential and non-traditional approaches to presenting fashion are generating buzz, creating more press and translating to sales.
As the examples above indicate, Emily works with brands to tell creative stories through stunts and real world experiences that invite participation, feel culturally authentic and generate social media shares. If Emily in Paris is any indication of how Gen Z wants to be marketed to, brands should take note and put a bigger emphasis on non traditional marketing campaigns and projects in the coming year.

If Paris is the City of Light, it’s also the city of dog poop.
Anywhere you go, on any street, in any quarter, you’ll be greeted by the familiar sight of a dog’s breakfast. Or at least what remains of it.
Make no mistake: Paris is a fecal minefield. And it always has been.
In a city known for its refinement, you could argue that the dog poop here is made to perfection — so much so that canine excrement from other cities is a distant no. 2.
Because here, every dog poop is the product of hours of French savoir-faire in the art of dégustation, digestion and excretion — a celebration of craft that brings the community together. After all, the best way to give a merde about society is by leaving one behind.
So to celebrate Parisian solidarity, I thought it would be interesting to document the sheer variety of dog poop in Paris, before these most humble of creations go the way of the dinosaurs.
It’s a truism that dogs are allowed to poop next to trees. At least then, people can avoid tarnishing their soles with a stranger’s gift. But what happens when this gift isn’t gifted in the streets’ litter…

In ways both small and large, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games is a series of firsts. It will be the first in the history of the Games to include breakdancing (or “breaking”) as a competitive event, and the first to achieve gender parity. Paris 2024 may also achieve the Games’ highest level of sustainability yet by becoming the first to halve its carbon emissions compared to the average of London 2012 and Rio 2016.
The goal has been years in the making, set in motion by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) — the Lausanne, Switzerland–based body that oversees all matters related to the Games and the Olympic Movement at large — and the IOC’s Olympic Agenda 2020, a roadmap that spells out its broader goals. Sustainability is a key pillar of that roadmap. The IOC has committed to reducing its direct and indirect emissions by 50 percent by 2030, when all Olympic Games must also commit to reducing carbon emissions and compensate for more than 100 percent of their residual emissions.
“Paris 2024 is the first edition to fully embrace this ambition of the strategic roadmap,” Marie Sallois, IOC’s director of corporate and sustainable development, told Convene. “From Day One, [Paris 2024] was conceived with sustainability in mind.” In fact, the Paris 2024 Organizing Committee — the body responsible for planning, organizing, financing, and delivering the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris in 2024 — pledged to halve carbon emissions during its bid, in step with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
That goal initiated a complete overhaul of the Games’ sustainability strategy, chiefly switching from a post-Games assessment to setting a pre-Games target and defining a carbon budget early on: less than 1.7 million tons of CO2. This carbon budget is treated much like a financial budget, where “every decision you make about an event, an activation,” Sallois said, “you must take into account how much it costs, how many people will work on it, and how much carbon it emits.”
“That’s a very different approach than the one we took in the past,” she said. Although many editions of the Games had “interesting, innovative solutions in terms of sustainability” — Sallois cited the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, which embraced circularity with recycled Olympic Medals and podiums — for Paris 2024, she said, “sustainability was first and foremost.”
Come July 26, 2024, when the opening ceremony kicks off, spectators and athletes will see this new iteration of the Games come to life, one where nearly every facet of the experience has been revised to lessen its environmental impact. “Some things are incremental, some things are drastic,” Sallois said. But overall, the strategy has been to “look at… the levers that contribute the most to the footprint.”
Of those levers, infrastructure ranks as one of the largest. Already, Paris 2024 has achieved a new benchmark in this category — 95 percent of the venues for the Games will utilize existing or temporary structures, the highest percentage of any previous Olympic Games. That includes historic sites that have been modernized — like Yves-du-Manoir Stadium, which served as the main venue for the eighth Olympiad in 1924 and will host the field hockey competitions for Paris 2024 — and temporary facilities, like an outdoor arena that will host the Olympic and Paralympic equestrian jumping and dressage competitions on the Etoile Royale esplanade at Château de Versailles.
The design of the new Aquatics Centre, the only permanent sports facility built for Paris 2024, meets stringent environmental standards. It has been built primarily with wood rather than concrete or steel, both of which create carbon dioxide in their manufacturing process, and will require less cooling and heating, aided by the rooftop solar array. The Olympic and Paralympic Village also demonstrates how infrastructure for the Games can be built using sustainable construction methods to lower emissions. Stretching into the neighborhoods of Seine-Saint-Denis, Ile Saint-Denis, and Saint-Ouen, the 126-acre site will accommodate 14,500 athletes and their staff during the Olympic Games followed by 9,000 athletes and their staff during the subsequent Paralympic Games. The Village’s carbon footprint is also 30 percent smaller than that of a modern construction project as a result of using wood and recycled materials. The latter, Sallois said, represents how the Village exemplifies “how we want to build for the future,” by not just focusing on lowering carbon emissions, but creating climate-resilient infrastructure.
Powering Paris 2024 infrastructure using renewable energy — like the geothermal-powered Olympic Village — will be a first for the Games, Sallois said, and what she thinks holds significant potential for the events industry at large. “Often in the past, the model for large events — and this is true for events other than sporting events — [is diesel] generators as a primary source of energy,” she said.
Instead, a newly created grid operated by French partner Enedis and EDF will supply Paris 2024 venues with energy produced via off-site wind and solar farms. According to the IOC, it will save 14,000 tons of carbon emissions. And it’s also permanent, helping to further the legacy of Paris 2024 by allowing future events to harness renewable energy, too — an idea that Sallois believes represents “a big shift for the industry of events.”
Solar energy generated on site also is helping to power the event. The Aquatics Centre’s photovoltaic panel-covered roof is intended to supply all of the facility’s energy needs and also will qualify as one of France’s largest urban solar farms. Similar installations will be added to the Olympic Village, the Transport Mall, and even the Seine, where a floating solar power plant with 7,750 square meters will supply energy to the Games and will be repurposed elsewhere later. Even the backup generators — essential in the event of interruptions in energy supply — will run on biofuels.
It helps that Paris is already one of the most walkable cities in the world, which is further bolstered by a robust public transportation system and the fact that many of Paris 2024’s major venues will be centrally located within the city.
“Paris, together with IOC, has completely revisited … transportation operations and the transportation plan to not only use the most efficient transportation means from a sustainability point of view, but also to reduce, in total, the [need for] transportation,” said Panos Tzivanidis, the IOC’s director of corporate events and services.
For Paris 2024, venues have been cherrypicked for their proximity to public transport — even beyond Paris. Lyon, Saint-Etienne, Nice, Bordeaux, Nantes, and Marseille will all serve as Olympic host sites in 2024, with France’s high-speed TGV rail network connecting spectators to those cities and other Olympic sites around France. Within Paris, those spectators will have the Paris metro to rely on, which has expanded routes for the Games, along with nearly 260 miles of bike lanes, including 54 miles of recently added lanes that will create new access points to competition venues. Thousands of extra bikes will be available for spectator use via Vélib, a public bike-sharing program. In addition, Toyota will provide a fleet of electric- and hydrogen-fueled transportation options on hand for athletes, staff, and spectators.
“Paris 2024 is really a turning point in our approach [to legacy] because now it’s really us adapting to the city, and no longer the [city] adapting to us,” Sallois said. That includes ensuring new infrastructure can be purposefully adapted and tailored to the needs of the host destination in the afterlife of the Games — a key goal laid out in the IOC’s Olympic Agenda 2020.
For example, the Aquatics Centre intends to benefit the residents of Seine-Saint-Denis, an area in Northeast Paris. During the Games, the Aquatics Centre will host the artistic swimming, water polo, and diving events but after it will provide a dedicated facility for the community — a huge asset considering that it’s an under-resourced area in terms of infrastructure and that six out of 10 teens in the area do not know how to swim. In addition, the Olympic Village site will provide the local community with more than 2,800 new housing units, two new schools, 14 acres of green space, and a new bridge crossing the Seine that links the Île-Saint-Denis and Saint-Denis neighborhoods, among other infrastructure.
For Paris 2024, legacy also goes beyond infrastructure. Paris 2024 “has a very clear legacy that has been already delivered prior to the Games,” Sallois said. “It means that the legacy is not something that you think about during the Games or after, you plan for it… to be delivered before the Games.” A prime example is Paris 2024’s commitment to motivating the country’s youth to exercise more. According to the National Observatory of Physical Activity (ONAPS), 37 percent of children between 6 and 10 years old and 73 percent of 11- to 17-year-olds do not get the recommended minimum of 60 minutes of daily physical activity. Paris 2024 has been successfully advocating for this cause through various initiatives, including convincing 36,250 French primary schools to add 30 minutes of movement to their daily schedule. “We are currently running a survey in one of the cities where these different measures have been introduced,” Sallois said, “and we know already that it has had an impact on the concentration, for instance, of kids at school.”
Sallois also pointed to how Paris 2024 has provided more economic opportunities to local businesses and organizations. According to the IOC, “early planning before the election of Paris 2024 as an Olympic host showed that the Games would generate activity for 181,000 jobs in a wide range of areas, including event organization, tourism, catering, and construction.” To streamline the process of applying for these opportunities, Paris 2024 created a new platform to ensure small businesses could compete with those with larger resources, Sallois said. This is part of a social charter solidified in 2018 between local trade unions and employer organizations, a first in Olympic history, to open up more opportunities and resources for job seekers and small businesses.
The result? “Ninety percent of the suppliers for Paris 2024 are French, and 75 percent of them are small- and medium-sized organizations,” Sallois said. “This is a big achievement — [especially] for the smaller businesses, because they have gained skills and a competitive advantage.”
Sallois emphasized that flexibility — the ability to adapt to the host territory — will continue to be key to future Olympic Games. Paris is “a very old city with a lot of existing infrastructure,” she said, and with L.A. 2028, “you’re again in a very large city with a lot of infrastructure and this is why they decided to go to a radical reuse approach — no new venues will be built.” The Olympic Village will use the UCLA campus, she said, “so it’s really a radical shift.”
One difference between L.A. and Paris is that travel by car is heavily favored in L.A, but Sallois is undeterred. “Still, we can innovate,” she said. For example, buses can be low-carbon buses. “We will find solutions, we just need to work with the constraints we have in a certain geography,” she said, but that often just means “we will innovate even more. I mean, because the Games take place every four years, by the time we reach Los Angeles, there will be new solutions on the market.”
Using Paris 2024 as a test pilot, the IOC and other entities worked with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to develop a new methodology for evaluating the social, economic, and environmental benefits of events. Guidelines based on this new methodology were released by the OECD in late 2023 for organizers to use for their own events, which can be downloaded in two parts: How to Measure Impact and Impact Indicators. Paris 2024 also has inspired another new set of guidelines — an updated ISO standard for managing the social, economic, and environmental impact of events, set to be released just prior to Paris 2024’s kickoff.
For London 2012, “we released for the first time ISO 20121, and now with Paris we are aiming at releasing the new version that will [reach] another level,” IOC’s Marie Sallois said, adding that the updated standard will put a greater emphasis on human rights, social justice, and legacy. The IOC’s Panos Tzivanidis said that the certification is “an important milestone” for not just Paris 2024, but for the IOC’s institutional events at large. “It ensures that every event we touch is aligned with our vision for a greener and more sustainable future.”
“An evaluation of the sustainability of the Olympic Games,” a study published in the April 2021 issue of online monthly journal Nature Sustainability, ranks Olympic Games — specifically those held between 1992 and 2020 — as only marginally sustainable. The study’s authors collectively rank the Games as “medium” — 48 out of 100 possible points on the scale devised for the study.
Broadly, the study states that it defines a “sustainable Olympic Games” as having three dimensions: “having a limited ecological and material footprint, enhancing social justice, and demonstrating economic efficiency.” According to the study, the Games could improve its marks by drastically reducing the size of the event, rotating the event between the same cities to reduce waste from building new infrastructure, and create an independent body to develop and enforce new sustainability standards. However, such actions come with obstacles, including a significant reduction in revenue from downsizing.
But the potential to make a positive impact — beyond the Games themselves — is huge. As the Nature Sustainability study points out, “together with their exceptional visibility, the Olympic Games provide a unique platform to reach a global audience and could serve as a model for cities, countries, and other events around the world to emulate.”

As a guide, the tourists and visitors, French or foreigners, that I guide ask me what to do in Paris, apart from the (too) famous Louvre and Montmartre district. They ask me what are my favourite places in Paris, what are the nice, cheap and tourist-free places where you can enjoy the city.
During my wanderings in the streets of Paris, I have collected little tips and cultural, artistic, and natural activities, totally free to do in the French capital. All you have to do is pick from this list and enjoy your moment without spending a penny. Ready to go?
If you have been reading me for some time, you must know my passion for modern art. I may be overdoing it BUT I have to admit that it is the best period in art history. Well, you know what, it is possible to enjoy modern art in Paris completely free of charge, with a view of the Eiffel Tower to boot. The Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, commonly known as MAM, is an artistic showcase in the heart of a pompous corner of the capital, a stone’s throw from the Eiffel Tower. What’s more, the entire display was redone a few months…

Paris is an amazing destination, but it can be even more fun if you know a few insider hints. I have been traveling to France since 1979 when I did my junior year abroad there. I became a French teacher and have been back to Paris around 25 times. Each time I go I learn something new, and many things can help someone enjoy the city more if you know them. Here are a few to help you.
The Louvre
Enter the Louvre through the metro and get off at station Palais Royale-Le Louvre(you will enter directly into the museum) and not the station that says Le Louvre( This will have you exit across the street to the Louvre) Something new though, you have to have your ticket to enter into the museum part of the Louvre, but it is easy to buy online through the Louvre at www.louvre.com or through the Paris tourist office at www.parisjetaime.com If you do not have a ticket you will have to enter through the pyramid by getting off at the Louvre metro or walking there.
There are bathrooms under both sides under the stairs. You do not have to pay to use them. If you use the bathroom in the food court you will have to pay a euro and 50 centimes.
Restaurants
The tip is included in your bill. Unfortunately, we have encountered a few waiters who have tried to take advantage of travelers by claiming the tip is not…

Fans of the film Casablanca know that when Rick comforts Lisa he means people will always have memories of people and places and moments in time.
The thing is, Paris — partly thanks to such films as Casablanca, Midnight in Paris, and Forget Paris (and many others) — revels in its reputation as the City of Light, the City of Love, a city rich in history and literature.
Much of that reputation lies in layers of myth, as many visitors soon learn the minute they step into the Arrivals section at Charles De Gaulle (CDG) airport.
Paris is a big, noisy, and bustling city. No two ways about it.
Rose-colored glasses soon fall to the pavement. And tourists fall victim to “Paris Syndrome,” seeming similar to Stendahl Syndrome, a condition that visitors to Florence suffer from too much beauty. Yet there’s a difference, yes?
Regardless, I love Paris, with all its warts and issues.
Believe me, warts exist. Note that I have visited Paris at least twelve times, for varying lengths of time.
But it’s understandable how so many of the millions of yearly travelers fail to find the Paris of their dreams.
Take my most recent trip, in March/April 2023.
During the first week, I wound up dodging garbage piled HIGH, almost to American first-floor height.
Tourists crowded every nook and cranny near the city center, so much so I didn’t get inside my favorite bookstore at all: Shakespeare & Co.
Fortunately, I stayed in the relatively tourist-free 15th arrondissement, about four blocks from the Seine, south of the Eiffel Tower and Champs de Mars.
I also got a good taste of what the city is truly like near the Buttes Chaumont.
And, of course, driving from CDG to the center, you can’t miss the concrete block apartment buildings and the banlieues on the way into the city, including Drancy, of ill fame during WWII.
Speaking of the Champs de Mars brought back a memory, one that should have shredded any desire of mine to visit Paris ever again.
It’s one of my most memorable Parisian memories.
Early on a June morning, I left my closet-sized hotel room on the Avenue Emile Deschanel and started toward the Champs de Mars on my way to a two-week cooking class at the Cordon Bleu at its former Rue Léon Delhomme location, “Fish and Their Sauces.” Since it was June, and warm, it only felt right to wear sandals. I’d change into sturdier shoes once I opened my locker at the school. The chefs didn’t allow sandals in the kitchens. And with good reason, given the heavy pots and boiling liquids so easily dropped or spilled.
As usual, I focused my eyes on the architecture looming above me. Rounding a corner near the far end of the park, my right foot forward, I stepped into a steaming pile of fresh dog poop. Creamy, warm, and stinky.
As the feces — likely from one of the pampered poodles of ladies living in the Faubourg Saint Germain area — seeped between each of my five toes, I frantically searched through my purse for some Kleenex. I leaned up against a wall and scraped as much of the goop off as I could.
As I flew through the door at the Cordon Bleu, I barked a terse, de rigueur “Bon jour” to the receptionist and hurried downstairs to the locker room. I ripped off the sandal and thrust my filthy foot into one of the sinks, pumping the soap dispenser like a farmer milking a cow.
With a half dozen paper towels, I managed to dry my foot enough to pull on a sock and the required leather shoe suitable for the kitchen. The left foot, no problem.
As for my sandals, I would never be able to get the subtle stink of dog poop out of the leather straps. I wrapped both sandals in a plastic bag and shoved them into the trash bin. Then I finished dressing in the required uniform, necessary even for short-term students.
I bought another pair of shoes from a street vendor in Montmartre a few days later. However, I never wore sandals again in Paris during any of my many future visits to the city.
Despite efforts to eliminate the French dog poop problem, it persists.
What to do?
Don’t look up before you look down first!

In these times, when supply far exceeds demand, and everyone is creating for the sake of sharing and appreciation, it’s crucial to take a step back, close your eyes, and find new perspectives. Otherwise, you might just end up bored and disinterested, since what you’re doing has probably been done before.
The unpredictable nature of street photography can be liberating, but it can also present a fog of opportunities without clear direction. You wake up in the morning, not knowing what you’ll bring home, which is fine and wonderful. However, there are occasions when having clear guidelines helps, especially when you are in a not-so-familiar place but want to make the most of it.
Living in the Netherlands, reaching the “City of Light” takes about a five-hour drive in an electric car. I’ve visited Paris several times, but this year I combined a weekend of tourism with my passion for street photography. With limited time for both, I needed to be objective.
The solution? To participate in a photography competition with a triptych mindset.

For weeks my friends and I had been complaining about the constant restrictions in Paris as the Olympics drew near. Popular metro stations were being closed. Our weekly walk in the Tuileries was compromised by barricades closing off our route. I even took photos of all the street closings and fences, planning to write an essay about why one would not want to visit Paris in May or June 2024. It was a horrible mess.
Though I am back in the US, I am aware that it got worse in the past couple weeks. I would hear from friends about bridge closings and increased metro and road closings. People needed QR codes in certain areas to get to their apartments. They had to cancel weekly walks because it was too hard to get to a meeting point.
I think that speaks less about Paris and more about the world we have created in which there is far too much violence and terror. Annoying as these closures were, they were needed to provide safety to Parisians and the thousands of visitors descending on Paris for the Games.
But I empathize with shop and restaurant owners who saw their businesses dwindle rather than rise with Olympic visitors. The New York Times reported on a restaurant that I frequent on Ile Saint Louis where I live six months/year. In warm weather, I can…

People will argue with me on this. For many, the race last weekend: Ronde van vlaanderen aka Tour of Flanders is the best race of the season. And indeed, in terms of spectator experience and in terms of cobbled climbs, which separate the gladiators from the men, climbs like the Paterberg, the bone shaking and long Kwaremont and the Koppenberg, it is indeed a great race to watch. Last weekend, it was the legendary Tadej Pogacar dropping his equally legendary rival, Matthieu Van Der Poel on the Kwaremont on their 3rd turn up the hill, to take his 2nd Tour of Flanders win.
But for me, the race that has always fascinated me, has had this weird combination of mystique and fear, has always left me romanticising about cycling is none other than the race I am watching while writing this blog: Paris-Roubaix, often known as the hell of the north.
A bit of cycling context, the most famous race on the cycling calendar is the Tour de France, which is a 3 week long stage race capturing the imagination of everyone who has ever ridden a bike. The stages spanning through beautiful French countrysides, ending in sprints, the battles on the slopes of the Pyrenees and the Alps, it is hard not be romantic about cycling. It evokes the primitive of emotions. It is poetry in motion. There are two other grand tours: Giro D’Italia and Vuelta d’Espana, both of whom hold less prestige than the Tour De France. These are the 3, 3 week stage races. There multiple 2 and 1 week stage races as well and then there are some famous one day races. Out of them, one of the key races has always been the Road World Championships which often happens at the end of the Vuelta, toward September. And then you have the 5 Classics:
If you were wondering if there are any other cyclists other than Pogacar and Van Der Poel, you can be excused. Out of the last 19 Classics, 14 have been won by these two. I am writing this part with 52.5 kilometers to go in today’s race and Pogacar, Van Der Poel and Jasper Philipsen (Winner of 2024 Milan San-Remo and Van Der Poel’s teammate) lead the race by 1'18"".
Simple reason: The drama. Take a look at this picture:
And this:
The start point of Paris-Roubaix is variable, for example, in 2025 it began in Compiègne (Which is a bit outside Paris). But it always end up in the Velodrome of Roubaix, where the riders do 750 meters and often end up in a sprint finish. In 2025, the distance of the race was 259.2 kilometers and it is often in that range and during these kilometers, the riders go through several cobbled sections.
These sections are hundreds of years old and are maintained by “Les amis des Paris-Roubaix”. This group of volunteers, founded by Jean-Claude Vallaeys in 1983 maintain the cobbled sections in their pristine state so that the racers have the same conditions of the cobbles every year. The cobbles, as I mentioned before are the main point of attraction of this race. The sections are graded with stars, with the 1 star sections being the “easiest” and the 5 star sections being the most challenging. There are 3, 5-star cobble sections and the race has 27 cobbled sections in total. The grading is based on the quality of the cobbles and the distance on them.
The most iconic section of the cobbles, pictured above is the Trouée d’Arenberg aka Arenberg Forest. It is 2400 meter section of cobbles, laid down at the time of Napoleon 1. The intensity of these cobbles is mind boggling especially coupled with the fact that the entry to the cobbles was on a downhill section, causing the riders to enter the section at a speed of 60 kmph. (A highly criticised chicane was added in 2024 to reduce the speed of entry). Even so, the Arenberg forest, about 100 kilometers from the finish is the place where the first selection is made from the group of favourites. There are 2 more sectors of the 5 star variety: the 3 km long Mons-en-Pévèle which has 2 right hand turns while climbing steadily and the decisive Carrefour de l’Arbre, which arrives 15 kilometers before the finish line. The 2.1 kilometer section is brutal, winding and with its proximity to the finish is often where the riders make the final attack.
As you can imagine, the race gets intense as the riders jostle with each other to get the best line over the cobbles, the bike shakes and you see bottles and parts fall out. These sections are narrow and if you get a flat, it is in your benefit that you’re in the front and can get a wheel change. If not, you get stuck behind and can lose a lot of time. In the words of a former 2nd place finisher and one of the icons of Paris-Roubaix, George Hincapie: “This is a war, you give them an inch, they will take a mile.” This race gets even more brutal when it rains. In the dry, the riders just inhale the dust of the cobbled sections. In the rain, they get covered in it.
If the selection hasn’t been made in the cobbles and there are still more than 1 riders in contention, the decisive move comes inside the iconic Roubaix Velodrome.
For all the twists and the Machiavellian turns, Paris Roubaix remains the best race in the spring classics for me.
In the words of the most winningest rider of the Paris-Roubaix, Tom Boonen:
The 2025 race was the surprising debut of Tadej Pogacar, who at 65 kilograms is much lighter than most of his rivals, including the pre-race favourite and 2-time defending champion, Matthieu Van Der Poel. Van Der Poel also was aiming to become the 1st man since Francesco Moser (1978, 1979, 1980) to win Paris Roubaix back-to-back, 3 times in a row.
The first selection in the race was made, as expected in the Arenberg forest with a bunch of the pre-race favourites including Wout Van Aert, Mads Pedersen, Pogacar’s teammate’s Nils Politt and Florian Vermeersch, and Van De Poel’s teammate, former 2nd place finisher Jasper Philipsen. Pogacar and Van Der Poel kept launching attacks from 100 kilometers out and it became a real war of attrition. Pogacar, who had already crashed earlier in the day, was almost got taken out by his team car.
With 55 kilometers to go, Pogacar launched an attack which left only Van Der Poel and Philipsen in his wake. As the race proceeded, another attack by Pogacar dropped Philipsen. With 30 kilometers to go, Pogacar took a strong right hand turn but didn’t slow down enough which caused him to crash into the barriers. Van Der Poel maintained a 20"" gap from Pogacar until Pogacar dropped off his bike and took a new bike with 20k to go. The gap grew to over a minute, but in the Carrefour de l’Arbre, it was Van Der Poel’s turn to change bikes. The change came quickly and though he nearly crashed into a barrier, Van Der Poel was never in doubt as he rounded up the Velodrome to take his 3rd Paris Roubaix win. Pogacar finished smiling, content with his 2nd place on his 1st showing here. Behind him, in a sprint Pedersen took the last podium spot, followed by Van Aert and then Vermeersch.
Thank you for reading!

Henry Miller is one dirty cunt. I’ve never read Marquis de Sade but I imagined that Miller to be a modern day Sade, blending all the taboos he can think about (and I can think about) into one novel. Miller is no stranger to being a banned author. Tropic of Cancer was banned in the author’s country of birth until 1961, almost thirty years after it made headways in Paris via the famous publisher Obelisk Press in 1934, where modern day Shakespeare and Co. Bookshop is now.
This is the reason I bought the book in the first place, on an obligatory purchase and visit to the well-renowned bookshop. It took me at least a couple of hours to decide which book to buy from the place. In all honesty, much of the book available on the shelves of Shakespeare and Co. are available in other bookshops and for cheaper. But I’m a bit pretentious at the best of times, so I needed to pick out a book. Henry Miller, who created a career in Paris and owed the city his success was a logical choice. I have not read Miller’s erotica, so why not eh.
When Miller wrote Under the Roofs of Paris (formerly known as Opus Pistorum), he was broke, hungry and would write a dollar a page for this kind of smut. Paris was known for its erotica back in the early twentieth century, its explicit postcards (which also feature prominently in the book) and smut writing was of no place to the conservative American mind at the time. But this sexual liberation was perhaps representative of Paris at the epoch, and it took an American to crystalise that epitome of recklessness.
In the introduction to Delta of Venus, Anaïs Nin spoke about Miller’s venture in writing erotica, that the collector wanted more, that the writers started to exhaust their personal stories and had to look elsewheres. I wonder if Milton Luboviski who commissioned Henry Miller for this was the same collector which demanded Miller to write with less poetry in his smut.
Perhaps not. Because I don’t find much poetry in the book. What we read is explicit sex, sometimes performed by individuals who shouldn’t be having sex. Some of the age is explicit, and the protagonist, Alf, had also indulged in engaging with these minors. I do feel sick at the thought of it and it makes me wonder whether Henry Miller had the same experiences. It would certainly adjust my respect for him as a person.
In the book, our protagonist Alf took part in bukkake-like orgies, a threesome with a midget (which also involves a German shepherd with a generous phallus which I guess makes it a foursome), threesomes with Lesbians, shooting porn, and let’s not talk about his involvement with underaged girls. All these leisurely activities are implemented in an extensive possible combinations of holes, body parts and bodily fluids. This list obviously, is far from exhaustive. Miller writes from experience, and whether some of these had happened to him or his acquaintances, I don’t really know nor do I really want to care.
Yes, I can find traces of Tropic of Cancer here with its crude and detailed description of sex, which makes me doubt if I am adventurous myself in that way. Alf’s organ, John Thursday, is akin to another character that literally always rear its ugly head at the worst (or best) of times. It’s like Alf has a constant walking erection. Alf and John Jeudi seem like different characters, but forever interlinked to one another and dependent on each other’s existence. Come to think of it, all men and their wangs are like that.
After the first hundred pages, the book loses its novelty, which also made me wonder if I had grown up too much to read Henry Miller. In Malay terms, we can say it’s “jelak” which means feeling eugh after having too much of something, usually after you’re halfway through that bowl of Peter’s pork noodles and you regretted getting a large portion instead of small. But comparing Miller’s writing to a bowl of hawker pork noodles is probably not the best idea.
In fact, if I can compare the reading experience with another book, it’d be Bret Easton Ellis’ American Psycho, where the violence felt too much after a while, too caricaturish, far an adaptation of what we know violence to be. The sex in Under the Roofs of Paris is of a similar nature. Never once do I feel the reality of it, however visceral or extreme the nature of it might be.
Now for the million dollar question: as an erotica, did it turn me on? Based on what I mentioned above, no. But there are bits of it that made me raise my eyebrows, and more often than not, bits of it where I’m just shaking my head and saying yeah nah in my head, impatient for the next scene to unravel. I’ve read the book in my commute home in trains and over coffee, but thankful and hopeful that nobody is peering over my shoulder and basking over the gratuitous language.
On a side note, there was also the matter of Billie and Jean, the former more of a lesbian than the latter. Did Michael Jackson steal his most famous song from the characters of Miller’s work? No matter, if it was coincidental, then more power to Henry Miller. Another vignette: the book’s original title, Opus Pistorum literally translates to the work of the miller. Clever cunt, that Henry guy.

On another P.S.S. read this stupendous essay on Henry Miller by Victoria Best, if you really want to dig deep into Henry Miller’s life and his past traumas.

I shouldn’t be getting into the habit of enjoying Easter holidays (or any holidays, Christian ones especially) and annual leave just in case I didn’t make it to extend my work visa, but truth be told? I do enjoy holidays as a normal person does and should.
For Easter this year, I went to Paris. When I received the job offer last September, I thought it would be proper that I started visiting some other great museums of ethnology or anthropology, so I could learn for my work. A great example is indeed, the Quai-Branly Museum in Paris, which I had heard several times when I was at school. This museum was definitely on my list of must-visit.
It wouldn’t be my first time to Paris as I went there almost a decade (2015) ago, during which I embarked on a less-than-72-hour marathon of “ticking the tourist’s boxes”: I was in Paris waiting for a flight back to Brno. As a poor student in one of the most expensive cities in the world, I tried to minimse my stay while trying to see EVERYTHING: Louvre? Tick. Château de Versailles? Tick. Champ Élysées? Tick. Eiffel Tower plus climbing it? Double tick.
I was not sure if this time would be better than a marathon, but I was aiming for a rather different route, i.e. another busman’s holiday of museums and histories. Yet, as the title suggest, unfortunately I was sick the whole time. To be specific, the moment I stepped off the Eurostar at Gare du Nord, I immediately realised my Easter holiday was going to be a bit of tumbling along the way.
There are two categories for my visits in Paris: the traditional way and the interactive way. Although the numbers of places in each category seem uneven, I want to bring out the distinction between this post and the next.
I definitely had to put this museum as №1 on my list, as I’m trying to be more prepared for my job at the MAA. I was also guranteed by many colleagues that I “wouldn’t regret”, “a must-see”, and they all left highly possitive comments for this particular museum. I therefore had really high hopes.
I arrived at the museum (with a low fever that was ready to rage in the following four hours) after I visited the Sainte-Chapelle in the morning. The entrance was rather empty, with a ramp that led to the main gallery. There was a large cylindircal space built with glass in the middle of the foyer, which ran through the floors and reached the basement, and through the dark frosty glass, it seemed to be a display gallery as well. (I will come back to this cool space)
Marching along the ramp, there was light and image of water ripples cast by an over-head projector, in hindsight reminding me the ramp of ocean tides that I once walked on in National Museum of Natural Science, Taiwan.
1.1 Oceania
I found myself standing in a tall and wide space, facing towards two galleries: On my right side was Pacific and Oceania; on my left was America. Immediately I was distracted by the large objects near me, which were displayed in a way familiar to me. Many photos of MAA taken by the visitors, no matter how randomly, often feature the large totem pole (1922.265), the slit gong, or the grizzly bear. It doesn’t mean that other collections are unimportant to them, neither does it mean that they learn a lot from these three display, but that they are large enough to be representative of a nice day-out on their photo albums. I am clearly biased for that I see MAA from a behind-the-scene, research-based perspective, and also I know a lot more collections that can be iconic. If I have to choose collections that represent MAA, I probably wouldn’t choose the above three. To me, the first impression of Quai-Branly, also the most impressive collections, could be these large wooden sculptured objects (masks, boards, ceremonial tools), but it may be completely different from what the staff members’ point of view.
Almost as a premonition, I stumbled across these two “boards” in a glass case. I didn’t know that later in April, after I came back from Paris, I would be seeing a large number of Gope boards with a researcher from West Australia. However, looking back the photos I took, I could see that both Quai-Branly and MAA shared a lot of common interest in terms of collecting policy, or put in another way, both museums were formed by early anthropologists who had a close network, who naturally formed the trendy studies of exploring the “unknown pacific islands” then.
I can recognise the very similar motifs of the face mask on the left side: heart-shape nostril, mushroom-shape dome above the head, and two dots, possibly pierced rings for decoration. All are present on the Gope boards I handled in mid-April. However, there are also a lot of features that I didn’t see on this face mask: The chevrons on relief, and the vibrant red, white, and black pigment commonly used. This object is also featured on Google Arts and Culture.
artsandculture.google.com
!! NOTICE !!
Readers discretion: Please notice that there will be images of HUMAN REMAINS (skulls) below.
Many objects on display reminded me similar collections that I once saw and handled in MAA. Strangely, through this exploration I started appreciating more my work and the reason why anthropology matters: The physical material being preserved acts not only a reminder of the culture that exists (or existed), but also as an evidence that shows that culture constantly evolves, and that artistic choices change all the time. Take the chest ornament above for example. The feathers being a crucial part in Asmat art were incorporated in a contemporary artistic creation. The handbag in MAA inherits the traditional material and presents a new usage, becoming a new tradition for the anthropologists in the next century.
It was at this point when the fever kicked in. I started feeling a cold chill spreading from my lower back, but my face felt so warm and my throat was coarse. I thought, however, that I was simply dehydrated, which was why I persevered.
Remember the huge cylindrical space mentioned before? I reached the end of the Oceania zone and met it again. Seeing through the glass, I saw shelves and storage units stacked neatly, with musical instruments arranged among them. Originally I thought it was a behind-the-scene display, allowing the public to see what a music storage house would look like. The tags on objects made sense. However, I was wrong, at least not entirely wrong. It was an exhibition “Storage of the unspoken” (La reserve de non-dits) by Youmna Saba, who explored the “sonic behaviour” of the ethnographic musical instruments. In the English booklet, I shared the same frustration as the artist explained,
[…] a great enthusiasm, then a lack of breath, before frustration set in. What can an instrument express in a dark glass tower the public only passes by?
The irony of preserving anthropological objects is that the method to extend the life span is exact the same to stifle the purpose of its life. There comes the philosophical question that many face: What use of x, if it can not perform the function when it was created? Does it still count an x? If not, are we simply doing the formality?
www.quaibranly.fr
The paradox is especially apparent on musical instruments, as they should be appreciated with hearing instead of looking. At the MAA, whenever there’s a community person visiting to see their own heritage collections, our policy is that they could choose to handle them with bare hands (without gloves), and it is amazing to see how, for example, musical instruments, sound when they are played. It is very tricky when it comes to wind instruments such as flutes, pipes, and horns, as we are not never sure if they were in contact with historical pesticide, which can make visitors sick. Nevertheless, the spirit is that the museum should be a place where people make the material legacies alive. I would love to know if this large display allowed people to physically handle the collections (it seemed close when I visited). If yes, how would the experience proceed?
At this point, you should find out that I had reached another section, Asia. Seeing the Paiwan ancestor board was really a nice heads-up. Another thing was that my fever was getting worse and I felt even more dehydrated.
!! Notice!!
There might be human remains (ashes) in the collections in the next photo. Readers discretion.
I was thrilled to learn more about shadow puppets from the audio guide. Apparently the fantastic performanceship originated in India, rather than China, which I was told as a kid. The story and the characters indeed changed and evolved as the style migrated and spread among different Asian regions. My first experience with shadow puppets was sorting them from the Skeat collection, which were less elaborate but all the same, impressive (See Z 33667 and Z 33587). I also admire how the Quai-Branly used light box to display the puppets, bringing the colours and crafting details to the eyes.
One can tell that I sped up my visiting pace as I didn’t take that many photos in Asia section.
The monologue I had upon seeing the Benin Bronzes was probably the same when visitors came to the MAA and saw exactly the same display. I have tried to explain to friends that museums simply couldn’t “pack them and ship them back to Nigeria”. If only it were that easy! Shame it’s not wrapping and mailing Christmas gift for Auntie Gladys. The most difficult part is never the practicality of packing and courriering, but the politics and funding that are involved in the repatriation process. Nevertheless, museums are not at liberty to share the details, which are the gap between them and the public.
I was really speeding up my visit without skipping too many collections on display, because my fever was getting a bit out of control. At one point I just felt I couldn’t get up and all I wanted was gulping water. There were at least two school groups at the same time so I used that as an excuse to proceed faster. The royal statue was the last before I moved on to the last section — America.
If I were to commit to a specific area of expertise, the First Nationas people in North America would probably be my second choice, other than East Asia. I know very little about them, but from what I was told and saw, I can relate the history of driving the indigenous people to extinction and how their land and language were taken away.
With a curator like Anita, a lot of research visits at MAA focused on American culture. I am not a stranger to many above. I was especially surprised to see the cape as I was 100% sure there was an identical copy of it in our own gallery, and I also saw the same design on a flyer for the MA Anthropology at Sainsbury’s Centre, UEA. I asked Rachel about it, and she told me that it was a popular design, and that was why it was widely used in woven textiles as gifts.
I spent around four to five hourse in the whole museum, and was absolutely drained when I left the place. I didn’t realise how sick I was until I realised I didn’t even want to shop in the souvenir stores, which I regret because I would love to get a tote bag. I got some flu medicine on my way home.
I had wonderful impression of Quai-Branly. The level and scale are what I envision how a museum of “world anthropology” should be. I still don’t think any museum in the world would be fit for the title “wold anthropology” for a simple reason: All collectors have preferences that are derived from their generations of academic focus, and those preferences are the reason why many museums don’t have the same level of attention on all cultures. Take the zeal for Oceania and Pacific Islands for example, both Quai-Branly and MAA have extensive resources and materials from the region. However, when it comes to Asia, they are usually relatively ignorant. I have to say that I do feel jealous — if that is a fair term to use here — because of my heritage, but I also don’t want to take away people’s attention on any minority groups.
2. Le Louvre, 29 March 2024
As I scrolled through my photo album, I realised that I did not actually like Le Louvre as a museum. If you quickly scroll through this section and compare the amount I wrote about it with Museum d’Orsay (next), you will know which museum I prefer.
My first visit to Le Louvre nine years ago was mainly to tick the box of “see the Mona Lisa (La Joconde)”, which I should say was a half-tick, because I never really saw it in an appropriate distance. My impression for the rest of the galleries was a bit blurred, and this was what I planned to revisit and take a good look.
I couldn’t describe how weird I felt when I stood at the grand foyer, looking at at least three moving escalators extending and ascending to mezzanines. I couldn’t, however, describe why I felt the deju-vu unsettling until I wrote these words down: It was a memory of rushing and running through the corridors, feeling pressed and shame because I couldn’t see the paintings. I have a strange habit: If I don’t get to enjoy a good thing properly the first time, I somehow would avoid coming back and re-enjoy it again. Possibly out of guilt and embarrassment.
I studied the map a little bit and tried to figure out which galleries I possibly had visited before just to avoid them. I didn’t, so I just randomly hopped on one of the escalators and was taken to a broad court full of Roman sculptures. It was a strange space for a brief moment, but in a good sense: The court was quite far away from the early morning crowd who were sprinting towards the Mona Lisa, so I could only hear the low and muffled talking and shouting through the walls. The majority interior design, including the sculptures, was white, reflecting the light and the cloudy sky from a high glassed ceiling. There were only a few visitors and they were sitting on foldable chairs, focusing on their sketches. I guess they were art students. I felt like wondering in a giant bubble in a sci/art-fi movie. In retrospection I am glad that my visit began in a quiet corner instead of another immediate overwhelm.
My strategy for visiting route is wondering and meadering, and avoiding the Mona Lisa at all cost (which is wise for a reason). Overall, I wasn’t impressed by what I saw that day; however, I found something new and it was a nice surprise.
I hope that one day someone could explain to me how or why there is a room full of historical scientific instruments in the Sulley Gallery. For a brief moment I thought I was at the Whipple Museum French Branch, as I could point to every object and name them: Butterfield type sundial, possibly of Augsberg and French made; equinotical ring dial; diptych dial; compendium; astrolabe; compound microscope, etc.. I tried to find more information about provenance and acquisition details but there wasn’t too much about them on the Louvre website. I’m also really intrigued to find out the curatorial reason behind the public display as I don’t think they relate to any other “artistic” collections nearby.
It was wonderful to see the gallery of Egyptian mummies and I vaguely remembered seeing them during the first visit. No surprise, it was fully packed with visitors. I felt a bit uneasy because I thought of the issues of displaying human remains, and all the discussion as a museum professional. Seeing so many visitors still not caring at all about what I thought was strangely unsettling and relaxing: I don’t think museums would ever be able to tell everyone how to behave around human remains, especially something with such high profile. A proportion of visitors will forever remain ignorant and have no regard towards any cultural sensitivity. I’m not saying that museums should stop trying to raise the awareness of respect and privacy, but to forbid a certain approach based on reasons hard to judge, i.e. whether the photos were taken out of despise/entertaiment/respect, is also a restriction of speech and could potentially create another type of dominance.
I don’t think I would want to come back to the Louvre the third time. Aesthetically it is an amazing museum, but I don’t resonate with the collections inside.
3. Musée d’Orsay, 31 March 2024
Before this trip, whenever I mentioned that I had been to Paris (ten years ago, almost), I had to say that I regretted not going to Museum d’Orsay. Yes, I knew it was famous and a must-go, but the decade-ago me was more keen on ticking the bucket list and less a museum person.
One of my colleagues was a passionate advocat of the museum. “Absolutely gorgeous” she said. And I found myself standing under an enormous arc where the train used to stop, now stood stunning marble sculptures.
It was stunning to see all three sculptures (above) displayed ensemble. The clever use of bronze for the sitters’ complexion and the amazing texture of onyx for their outfits really brought out them to life. What’s more interested is the labels: All three sculptures were under different titles once, given by the artist. They were renamed to avoid outdated historical racism.
www.musee-orsay.fr
I am always a fan of watching how the westerners portrait what the world looks like to them. I started paying more attention to this type of creation when I visited the Frederiksborg Castle in Copenhagen, seeing the four corners painted on the ceiling of the Audience Room that depicted the four continents of the globe. I realised how distant it was for the artist to even grasp the concept of what Asia was: The corner painting featured a Turkish man with a turban and a glorious moustache; a camel kneeling beside him.
Contrary to putting a Turk as a representation for Asia, the bronze sculpture in Museum d’Orsay, created in the 19th century, featured a more East-Asian-looking person, possibly because of wars and trade in East Asia. I would say this is how geopolitics are involved in art. On a closer look, as I wrote down this late journal, I noticed that the Asian representation was actually a female (the bossom) with a male braid. How bizzare and intriguing! Was this an intentional decision by the artist? Or was this simply a mixed-up?
A great deal of my visit time was spent in the exhibition Paris 1874: Inventer l’impressionnisme, which in the beginning I didn’t plan to go. However, I couldn’t resist a free exhibition and the fabulous paintings by Monet, plus the queue was not crazy long. In the end, I made the little detour and joined the little crowd (which turned into a massive herd when I left).
I thought it was going to be a “nice and little” exhibition featuring Monet and others (who, unfortunately, I didn’t know. That’s why I only named Monet). Have I been more wrong than this? Probably not. It was an exhibition about impressionism, but it provided a profound historical context on the social change and artistic evolution that led towards the familiar style we know today. There were lots of sketches, photos, and archives that scafolded the beginning of impressionism before I finally saw the Sunrise painting. During the visit I sometimes felt quite embarrassed because I clearly was not up for such in-depth cultural education, especially I was planning on visiting a niche museum later that day.
Every time I see a chinoiserie style in a painting or as an interior design, I always feel surreal. As a child I felt that Eastern elements were strictly limited in Asia, and to see them in a western setting was like seeing an ostrich among chickens — odd and distinctive. Questions like “Did they already know where China and Japan were?”, “have they seen our stuffs already?” and “did they know any Asian person?” will always be in my head. I wonder if it’s the same surreal feeling for a westerner to see late Qing court paintings, which were profoundly influenced by Jesuit missionaries.
That was the last painting I took picture of in the exhibition. It was extremely crowded and noisy so it was a good time to get out of the place.
I became a fan of Cézanne during my teenage time. I appreciate the saturation of colour as well as the clear boundary lines he used.
“Les Âges de l’ouvrier” was a gem among all the artworks that I took picture of. Fédéric was a symbolist painter, which means that his artworks usually contained hints and audience needed to read between the lines. The painting is presented in a triptych, which resembles a traditional religious arrangement. Among the children playing cards (symbolising vice and greed) is a boy, behind who a basket at his head position resembles a saint’s halo.
I finally acscended to the second floor where I was surprised to find a large crowd at the restaurant, and an even larger crowd straining their necks in front of, not just anyone’s, but VAN GOGH’s famous painting of the yellow room. I am never a fan of Van Gogh, so I used this as an excuse and skirted through the gallery.
I was glad to finish my first visit to the Orsay with Monet’s most acclaimed artworks. It was definitely a brief visit, but I made sure I had time to go through all the galleries. If there was any regret, I would say it was that I didn’t get a tote bag (but I bought a T-shirt with Monet’s artwork!).
Overall, I like Museum d’Orsay. It’s incredibly large with amazing artworks; everyone is going to find a piece of art that they like. I appreciate the map and directions that point to the highlight for a quick visit. The audio guide was insightful, though I was hoping for a more flexible touch, such as the one I had in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. The gift shop was nice (I only realised the importance of a good gift shop after this visit and I may come up with a short post about why they are important) but the location was quite awkward.
4. Musée Fragonard, 31 March 2024
I left Museum d’Orsay about two o’clock. Rather early for me; I usually reserve a whole day for just one museum visit. However, I was on a mission to a special museum before I left Paris — Musée Fragonard.
Make no mistake, this is not the Perfume Museum and it has nothing to do with Fragonard the perfumist. I believe that the name Fragonard is a coincident, that this oldest veterinarian school in France happens to have the same name with the perfume brand.
The museum isn’t in the city centre and I had to spend almost an hour from Panthéon (a small detour after Museum d’Orsay) on bus. It was pouring and I felt like the bus was waddling through a sudden flood in Paris, but gladly the tempest died when I finally arrived. I spent some time asking around because I found myself in the middle of a college on a Sunday, when no one stayed in the classroom. Two ladies pointed me the way.
People who know me can always be certain that I’m a big fan of medicla museums. I was definintely gutted to learn later that Musée de l’Histoire de la Médecine was not open due to Easter holiday, but I still had the chance to visit something related — animal anatomy, or vet science.
The Fragonard Museum was definitely a quirky place that can be easily recognised as a university museum: It is tucked away in a humble teaching block; except a few signs and a sleepy security guard 500 meters away, there was no sign to direct the visitors.
I was, nevertheless, amazed by the enlarged teaching models neatly arranged in the display cases. I had never been to a historical vet science museum, so it was a little bit overwhelming at first (especially I only had two hours before the museum closed, and I intended to listen to every.audio.episode.)
Not to sound like a Y2K emo teen but I love anything that associates with death. The rituals that human plan and do in order to mark, remember, relieve, and avoid death are remarkable… They are the last chance for the dead to look back the living world, and the living to forsee what it will be like when we step into the unknown. Object that we study in order to understand death are similar to that. Is this the reason why museums now talk more about resepcting human remains? I wonder; but if bones of human beings are to be treated differently, how come we don’t apply the same attitude towards other animals’ bones? I also think about the lines between collections treated in a scientific and anthropological manner: If a human skull was collected for scientific racism study, it would migrate to repatriation based on anthropological reason. However, animals that sacrifice or were intentinally made ill for scientific purposes were less likely to be treated with anthropological sensitivity.
I wish that there were more textual labels along the display, as the audio guide did not help memorise (it was great content, though, very informative). Or perhaps I just need to find another way to record what I heard on the audio guide.
However, I managed to remember one thing from the audio guide. The pictures above showed the signature on one of the anatomical models, E. Petitcolin, dated 1901. It stands for Eugène Petitcolin, the preparator and model maker of the vet school.
My experience at the Whipple Museum left a valuable lesson in my mind, that all of the great scientific achievement would not have been possible were it not for the tool makers, publishers, etc.. Our education focuses a lot on the theories proposed by the great theoretician and philosophers, but not much time is spent on what compliment their success. Take Auzoux’s papier-mâché human model for example: Hundreds of thousands (an underestimation) of medical students would not have become doctors if there hadn’t been a chance to test their knowledge before practicing on patients. Some of the model makers even took their craftmanship to the next level: Not only were they accurate and precise, but the colour and material made these models, though mass produced, artistic, offering inspiration and perspective on life and the wonder of it.
Petitcolin worked his whole life for the vet school and was a pioneer in model making and preservation. I appreciate how the museum preserved these historical teaching tools, and it was wonderful that he gets to be featured in the tour. I think all museums should, if given chances, reflect upon the assistants and technicians that did the bidding. One example that I feel right is the rooms at the Centre of Material Culture (of MAA), which are named after Clare Isobel Fell (archaeologist, 1912–2002), Samuel Cowles (museum assistant), and Maureen M. O’Reilly (assistant curator), who were women and assistant dedicating their lives to the work, but not necessarily remembered in the history.
However, this is not the highlight of the Fragonard Museum.
! Attention!
The photo below contain human remains. Readers’ discretion advised.
These are écorchées, or the flayed collections. Made by Honoré Fragonard (1732–1799), who used to teach anatomy in the vet school, these are considered the treasures of the museum. The technique that Fragonard employed is still not fully understood. I could see that this was dry specimen, and I assumed that the material involved a lot of wax, hence the shiny gloss on the surface. My impression was proved right when I read later, that these creations were made not based on anatomical studies, but more for a theatrical performance. I definitely felt the intense glare from the first standing man, Goliath. I feel very fortunate that I am not bothered by such beautiful creation because I can imagine many people shying away, and I understand that.
This is probably the longest post I’ve written in English so far. I’ve waited a long time before I even started writing it, and procrastinated several times because life since April has been like being strapped on a rocket while skating on icy road, totally chaotic.
I have a mixture of positive and negative views on Paris as a city and the two visits I’ve made so far. I think it is a wonderful metropolitan: sleek, chic, vibrant, and everyone can have a place; and yet I don’t feel like I can find a place there, just as I feel about London. However, this is not a travel blog.
As for museums, I absolutely give them a five star overall. During this trip, I have ticked more boxes on my bucket list, without loosing the quality and depth that I was looking for. The regret that I didn’t get to visit Museum of the History of Medicine is a strong reason to bring me back to this city.

Paris: where Love, Creativity, and Perfection Converge.
This day one year ago,
we were admiring the perfectly planned lanes of Paris while standing on the famous,
brilliantly marketed,
iconic Eiffel Tower
We watched Paris basking in the golden glow of the setting sun,
and then it all started to twinkle and looked even more beautiful and serene as evening descended.
Damn!
I admired the vision through which the city was planned.
I also read about its history, even though we walked over 15,000 steps a day. Human creativity and vision know no bounds.
At that time, I wasn’t sure if it was pressure, punishment, or reward, but they designed a freakishly beautiful city that endures even after you leave it.
So, as you stroll through the lanes of Paris, it dawns on you that something this grand can be created with stunning detail.
Perfectionism isn’t just a term;
It’s something that can and should be pursued.
If you do so,
you can create something that stands out
and remains eternal
for ages to come.
And even though it’s a big crazy city, with constant traffic and crowded metro rides,
there is love in the air!
There’s something so (geographically!) blessed about the air that it heals you.
You immediately miss someone in Paris and want to return with them. (This could be true for any city in Europe though!)
I met my husband after a month in Paris;
he stayed for two weeks longer than I did.
The first thing I said when he picked me up at the airport was, ‘This air is so healing.’ As the quote says —
“Breathe in Paris, It nourishes the soul” — Victor Hugo
So the air and city itself is enough to fill your heart, and yeah, it leaves a strong impression that you’d wish to witness this grandness again.
“A walk in Paris will provide lessons history, beauty, and in the point of life.
We did talk about history and astonishing beauty,
What is the point of life that you see by looking out from the Eiffel Tower?
One takeaway for me is that boundless creativity and perfection exist.
There is nothing wrong with obsessing over perfection.
You might as well build something resembling Paris!

Revoir Paris | Essay Three
I spent a month in Paris, this time, and could simply be there, live there, and revisit places and experiences that I have loved.
Mostly it didn’t rain.
As the days passed under skies of blue or mother-of-pearl, and I relearned the layout of favorite boulevards and quarters and how to take buses everywhere, and eventually mastered how to make it back to the hotel tucked into a sidestreet without first overshooting the mark, Paris began to feel more familiar than ever it had before.
Perhaps I could finally live there because in previous visits I had ticked the tourist sites off the list, and made the big-ticket historical, artistic, and literary pilgrimages, and thus had no further itch to scratch.
Or perhaps it was because while there I turned seventy (which was the idea) and brought to the adventure a mellowing soul.
I think it was the latter reason, mostly, but also because I had flown to peacetime Paris from a war zone and could remind myself viscerally and experientially of what I know intellectually: that a whole, beckoning world exists that is not at war, and that in the absence of war, life can be brilliant, creative, and happy.
Paris has not always been at peace, of course.
Some people know about the Hundred Years’ War between England and France (1337–1453).
Everyone in the world has heard about the French Revolution (1789–1799) — and some know of the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) and the Paris Commune (1871). [1]
Many people know about the high price in blood paid by the French in WWI; some would argue that this led a still shell-shocked populace to follow WWI hero Philippe Pétain into WWII collaboration with Hitler.
If you notice shrapnel-pockmarked building facades from the Nazi era, or memorial signage on buildings, you will learn of Vichy (French) police roundups of Jews and Gestapo executions of Resistants in the very heart of Paris. [2] & [3]
But on this day especially, the world — my whole world — became a jewel box (the Théâtre du Palais-Royal [4]) nested within a coffer (the Domaine national du Palais-Royal) nested within a treasure chest (the Palais-Royal quarter of the 1st arrondissement).
I paused at the southern entrance to the Jardin du Palais-Royal to admire Paravent Girls [5], an Art Basel Paris bronze installation by Egyptian multimedia artist Ghada Amer [6], and then flânered the lovely garden’s length.
I was on my way to the Théâtre du Palais-Royal to meet my cousin and her husband at a performance of L’extraordinaire Destinée de Sarah Bernhardt:
The stage goddess (b. 1844 — d. 1923) lived a hard-working, celebrated life, [7] and like today’s rock stars and pop divas, toured the world “collecting men and animals, having a baby with a prince. . . and doing it all with extravagance, humor, and unfailing commitment.” [8]
The producers were wise to stage the show in so sumptuous a playhouse! Seated on red velvet — or velour? — inside so gilded and plush a venue, one can’t pretend for a second that one has not come to lose oneself entirely in theatrical magic.
Now it is Saturday night at dusk in sharp weather. Night is rapidly falling as my cousin’s husband, Alain, shepherds us across Place Colette, where a crowd couples-dances en plein air to a live jazz and blues orchestra.
We wait on a curb at a red light in a drizzle. From afar, shimmering ice-blue diamonds jet and spill up and down the height of the Eiffel Tower [9]; the Tuileries’ Roue de Paris (ferris wheel) glitters like a diamond-studded hoop suspended in air.
Alain hails us a cab on Avenue de l’Opéra; the grand thoroughfare pulses with neon signage and street lamps and head and tail lights that shimmer off the wet pavement as if they are sequins and gemstones: rubies, diamonds, emeralds!
A switch flips in my neurocircuitry already buzzing from having been to the theater. But now outside in the dark amid festive crowds, the myriad lights have jolted me even more widely awake and strongly alive.
Sparklers go fizzing and blazing through my arteries. My whole bloodstream effervesces! If I weren’t bundled in a fleece jumper and down vest, my skin would be emitting visible sparks.

I met my friend and mentor Yves three years after arriving in France. I was a waiter in a neighborhood restaurant on the Left Bank in Paris. It was, with a stint at McDonald’s, one of my many student jobs. Yves arrived as we were getting ready to close. The kitchen was already closed. He said that he was very hungry and wondered if we had any leftovers in the kitchen. Unfortunately, we had nothing. I recommended a kebab place that was not far. It was at this moment that he asked me how long I had been working there, because he had never seen me, even though he was a regular customer. I also learned that Yves and his family lived a five-minute walk away. He seemed interested in my background.
 “I would like to continue this conversation on my next visit,” Yves said.
A few weeks later, Yves was back at the restaurant with two young ladies, whom he introduced as his daughters. Later, I learned that one of Yves’ friends was my teacher. This was the beginning of a great friendship between Yves and me. He became the mentor to whom I turned for advice regarding my student, professional and private life. His whole family welcomed me. I found a second family. Yves was Jewish. His parents had been in concentration camps. He didn’t talk about it much. One almost had to really press him to get him to talk about it. I later realized that it was more out of modesty and the fear of opening serious and deep wounds. I was often frustrated, because I felt that he should talk about his story which is part of a dark chapter in the history of France. Yves, who is now over 70, told me each time that I had the enthusiasm of youth and that I would understand later. This response frustrated me even more. I was often also struck by the fact that my friend did not observe the Jewish holidays. I brought it up to him.
 “Why don’t you celebrate Hanukkah or Rosh Hashanah?” I asked him one day. “It’s like you’re ashamed of being a Jew.”
Yves remained calm, but from his expression I understood that it was not the first time someone had made the same observation.
 “I am not religious. I don’t believe in any God whatsoever. I am a scientist,” he replied.
Yves was indeed an eminence in the energy and IT sector. He was very respected but that did not justify him turning his back on something that I considered fundamental.
 “But, mon ami,” I retorted, “you can’t pretend it doesn’t exist. You can’t act like being Jewish isn’t part of your identity. Your family, like other Jews, were hunted down and exterminated in camps just because they were Jewish. Not practicing your religion means letting the Nazis and the antisemites win,” I told him. “I hear you and you know that I fight against all racism of any kind and I will never stop. I will fight to the end for humanist values, but I am simply not religious,” he said.
We had a thousand and one discussions on this very important subject. Often, my friend agreed to answer questions about his family during Nazism and their deportation to Nazi camps. But it was painful. One of our points of contention was Yves’ political affiliation. He voted for the progressive left in the French political spectrum. I have always been a centrist. I did not understand his political affiliation, because I felt that certain leaders of the French progressive left were antisemitic, but my friend said that he recognized himself in the humanism of the left. He worked on projects to light up the world. I learned to respect his modesty. For years, I took advantage of current events to talk about antisemitism, Nazism and the Holocaust. He has learned to deal with my intrusions into his sacred and painful past.
Since the beginning of our friendship, which now dates back more than 20 years, Yves has never been the one to initiate a conversation about antisemitism. Yet, God only knows how many times we had talked about racism, intolerance, moral and material poverty, history, the future. It was always I who brought up antisemitism. Even after Hamas’ October 7 terrorist attack, it was I who opened the discussion.
As a result, huge was my surprise when my friend brought up antisemitism a few days ago, while we were discussing French President Emmanuel Macron’s decision to dissolve the parliament and organize snap elections, after the crushing defeat of his party in the European parliamentary elections on June 9. I thought we were going to analyze Macron’s political poker move and what it says about the young president’s place in French history.
 “I’m afraid for my daughters,” my friend took me by surprise. “Tara, I’m really scared. I’m very scared. Macron made a big mistake. I’m afraid my daughters will pay the price.”
I was speechless. On the other end of the phone, I had the impression that it was a total stranger speaking. I had never heard this trembling voice, filled with contradictory emotions. There was fear, even fright. There was worry, resignation but at the same time a touch of hope coming through but dressed in anger.
Yves and I called each other “Tara,” which means wise or elder in one of my father’s dialects. He asked me to come up with a name from home at the start of our friendship. I chose “Tara” because Yves was my wise man, my mentor, the father I had lost when I was very young. He was my friend, my brother. I was Catholic. He was Jewish. I was black. He was white. But we never looked at each other in these aspects. His family welcomed me as one of their own. I knew almost all of them, down to his cousins, nieces, nephews, uncles and aunts. When my mother came to France for the first time, a niece of Yves, who is a doctor, personally examined her to make sure everything was okay. She had given her the medical attention that my mother had never had. My mother swears by Dr. Marion Adler. It’s one of her best French memories. “She saved my life,” my mother told her sisters and relatives in Africa about Dr. Adler.
This June 12, Yves’ fears were due to the fact that the polls significantly favor the National Rally, which is the new face of the National Front, an extreme right-wing party whose founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, had declared that the Shoah, a Hebrew word for the Holocaust, was a “detail” of history. It is the daughter, Marine Le Pen, of this notorious antisemite, who is the leader of the National Rally. Over the years, she has embarked on a “normalization” campaign of the far right by giving a light face from the outside to a political party whose ideology has not changed one iota. The ideology is just dressed up in flashier clothes. It is like dressing vulgarity with Chanel. It will remain vulgarity despite its appearance.
Le Pen was paradoxically helped in her de-demonization enterprise by Jean-Luc Melenchon, her big enemy and rival from the far left, whose recurring antisemitic statements make her appear as a moderate, close to the Jews or even their defender and protector. Le Pen did not hesitate to support Israel after October 7.
Unsurprisingly, the transformation of the National Rally and the assumed antisemitism of the leader of the far left have plunged many in the French Jewish community into an impossible situation, particularly when an anti-Jewish act is committed on average every day in the country. While certain Jews, including the famous Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld, have said that they would vote without hesitation for the National Rally’s candidates in the event of a standoff between the far right and the Popular Front, a last-minute political party created a few days ago by the various left-wing parties to oppose the far right, my friend does not have a dilemma.
 “I will never vote for the National Front,” Yves told me, using the original name of the National Rally.
His comment revealed his deep thoughts: Yves does not believe in the supposed normalization of the far right. Watching it so close to power had brought to the surface what he had buried deep inside for decades. I actually understood that my friend had been reluctant to talk about the deportation of his parents to the concentration camps — who did not know each other at the time — because he was afraid that history would repeat itself. He was convinced of the duality (good and evil) which coexist within us humans. History is full of periods when hatred took over from tolerance. Yves fears a new Holocaust during his lifetime. He believes his fears are about to become reality. He fears that a victory of the National Rally on July 7 will bring back the Collaboration period, the period between July 1940 and August 1944 when France, led by Vichy France whose leader was Marshal Philippe Petain, was an accomplice to German crimes. Yves fears that a new far right government will unleash its xenophobic ideology like it did 84 years ago.
 “In your opinion, who will be the first targets?” he asked me rhetorically. “Of course, it will be us Jews, then Muslims or Arabs.”  “I think that Arabs or Muslims are first on the list, then non-Muslim blacks, because immigration is the cause of all of France’s ills they say,” I replied. “Then it will be the Jews’ turn.”
Yves and I did not completely agree on the order of target list for a far right government. On the other hand, we agreed that he and I were going to pay a high price. He, because he is Jewish, and I, because I am black.
 “They will send you back to Africa. As for me, I don’t know where they will throw me,” said mon ami.
There was a sort of silence. We both imagined where Yves would end up and the prospect was frightening. Yves seems determined to prevent what his parents and others had experienced from happening again. He considers various scenarios to protect his people from possible barbarity but, at the same time, he recognizes that living a persecuted life is not ideal.
If the National Rally wins on July 7 in France, a new era would begin in France and in Paris. It would be a new France, a new Paris, whose central characteristic would be the French first, and more specifically, the native French, the fundamental question being what it means to be French or what French identity is.
For the far right, being French means being white, speaking French and being Christian. French identity is thus linked to religion. Anything that is contrary to Christian values thus threatens the French identity. By deduction, immigration, particularly of North Africans because they are Muslims, is a big threat to the French identity. It doesn’t matter that the grandparents of these North Africans, or Arabs as they’re referred to locally, fought for France during the two world wars. Nor does it matter that a 1905 law separated the Church from the State by proclaiming secularism as a fundamental principle of the republic, that is to say, a free exercise of religion. In 2022, Marine Le Pen declared that if she were elected president “Algerians who already live in France and behave in accordance with French law, respect our habits and customs and love France, have no reason not to stay. The others, certainly in the minority, will have to leave.”
Algeria, a North African country located on the other side of the Mediterranean sea facing Marseille, was once a French colony. In 1962, it gained its independence, causing the departure of nearly a million white French people who had settled there. They had settled mainly in the south of France. They are known as “Pieds Noirs”, Black Feet, a reference to the fact that they lived in Africa before the Evian Accords which sealed Algeria’s independence. These “Pieds Noirs” have nourished a lot of resentment towards Algeria, Arabs and Muslims. They want their revenge. It is this resentment that has fueled the French far right for decades.
The new Paris will be an anti-immigrant Paris. Le Pen and her cronies do not differentiate between legal and illegal immigrants. The foreigners threaten the national existence. They are an external threat. It is the confrontation between the inside and the outside. This fight against external threats is necessary because it is a defense of the French identity, says the National Rally.
A white American Christian would tell me that they don’t see why they would be targeted if they decided to move or visit the new France. The response is simple: for the National Rally, America is the face of liberalism, neoliberalism and globalization, all of which are seen as changes which have undermined and continue to threaten the French identity. They must be fought to preserve the core. In France, immigrants are those who embrace American power with open arms, while the far right sees America as the devil, a hated outsider. It considers that the current French elites are under the thumb of the globalists of America which is the dominant in the narrative of the dominant vs. the dominated, as is told by the National Rally. Le Pen wants to “protect” the dominated or native French and restore French national, social and cultural identity against the dominant or the foreigners, whoever they may be.
If you are white, Catholic and speak French you will be welcome. For the rest, you will be an enemy from within. The National Rally has endorsed candidates who are nostalgic for the Vichy government and openly antisemitic. One of them, Françoise Billaud, paid tribute on her Facebook page to Marshal Pétain and the collaborationist priest Jean-Marie Perrot. Frédéric Boccaletti, another possible future lawmaker of the National Rally, founded a bookstore in 1997 which features books which deny the Holocaust.
 “Tara, I’m scared,” Yves repeated at the end of our conversation. “I have never been so scared in my life. I don’t see any escape.” “Don’t lose hope, mon ami,” I said to him. But deep down, I was just as afraid as Yves.
In a few days, a new day will dawn in France. Will it be a day of fear?

And I’m (finally) okay with that.
I’ve done my fair share of traveling — much more than I ever would have thought I would when I was much younger. I’ve been to many more than half of the states in the United States. I have been to Europe a handful of times and have enjoyed the sights and sounds of at least ten countries over there. I’ve been to Canada and Mexico. I’ve been to a significant number of islands in the Caribbean.
Sounds pretty good, if I do say so myself.
It’s just that there has been this one location — this one place — this one dream vacation spot of a lifetime, that has eluded me for lo these many years.
That locale — the stuff of fantasy and romance — is, of course, Paris.
These weren’t postcards from places I had actually seen. Nope, as a child my family’s annual vacation destination was our local zoo.
These were postcards I begged for from friends, family, friends of the family and the family of friends.
Anyone, going anywhere, all I asked was a cool shot of something tourist worthy. For the most part, I was indulged in my requests.

Hey there, travel buddies! It’s your girl back with another adventure that literally broke my blog last month (100K visitors in one day? I’m still in shock!). So grab your favorite drink, get comfy, and let me take you through the cobblestone streets of Paris — a city that feels both exactly like and nothing like what you’d expect.
I’ve been to 47 countries, but there’s something about Paris that keeps pulling me back. Maybe it’s the way the light hits the Seine at sunset, or how the smell of fresh baguettes seems to follow you everywhere. Or maybe it’s just because I’m a total art nerd who can spend hours staring at one painting (spoiler alert: I did exactly that at the Orsay).
Let’s start with the Musée d’Orsay, which honestly deserves its own fan club. First things first — this place used to be a train station! I mean, talk about a glow-up, right? The moment you walk in, you’re hit with this incredible ceiling that makes you wonder why we ever stopped building beautiful things.
I arrived at opening time (pro tip: always, ALWAYS arrive at opening time) and made a beeline for the Impressionist galleries on the top floor. The thing about the Orsay that nobody tells you is how the natural light changes everything. Van Gogh’s self-portrait at 9:30 am hits completely different than at noon.
I spent a ridiculous three hours just on the fifth floor. No regrets. Standing in front of Monet’s water lilies, I literally forgot I had a flight to catch the next day. Some American couple next to me was arguing about where to have lunch, and I wanted to shake them and say, “DO YOU NOT SEE THIS MASTERPIECE RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU?!” But I kept it cool. Mostly.
After the Orsay, I desperately needed caffeine, so I ducked into this tiny café called Le Petit Cler that wasn’t in any guidebook. The barista took one look at my camera and said in perfect English, “Another tourist who thinks they’ll find the real Paris?” I laughed and asked him in my terrible French where the real Paris was. He smiled, wrote down an address on my receipt, and said, “Go there after the Louvre. Trust me.”
(Spoiler: I did go, and it was this incredible little jazz bar where I ended up dancing with an 80-year-old Parisian gentleman who told me stories about meeting Picasso when he was a child. Some experiences you just can’t plan!)
After my mystery café recommendation, I headed to the Louvre. Listen, this place is MASSIVE. Like, you-could-spend-a-week-here-and-not-see-everything massive. I’ve been three times now and I’m pretty sure there are entire wings I haven’t discovered yet.
Here’s my controversial Louvre take: skip the Mona Lisa on your first visit. I KNOW, I KNOW. But hear me out. The crowd around her is insane, you’ll barely see her, and there are literally thousands of other incredible pieces that you can actually get close to and enjoy without someone’s selfie stick in your face.
Instead, I wandered through the Egyptian antiquities section and found myself completely alone with artifacts that are over 4,000 years old. ALONE. With HISTORY. In what universe does that make sense while hundreds of people are fighting for a glimpse of La Joconde?
But the real magic of the Louvre happens when you get lost. Seriously, put away the map for 30 minutes and just wander. I turned a random corner and stumbled upon The Winged Victory of Samothrace with no one else around. Just me and this 2,200-year-old masterpiece having a moment together. I may have teared up a little.
The thing about Paris that my Instagram can never fully capture is what happens between the museums. Walking from the Orsay to the Louvre along the Seine, I watched an elderly couple dancing to an accordion player near Pont Neuf. They must have been in their 80s, moving slowly but with such grace that several tourists (myself included) just stopped to watch.
Later that afternoon, I got completely lost near Le Marais and found myself in a tiny square where local children were playing soccer while their parents chatted on benches. One little boy kicked the ball my way, and before I knew it, I was in an impromptu soccer game with a bunch of French kids who thought my terrible footwork was hilarious.
These moments — the ones between the famous sites — are what make Paris magical. The way light falls through tree branches onto century-old buildings. The sound of church bells mixing with scooter horns. The smell of rain on warm pavement outside a bakery. You can’t plan for these things, but they’re what you’ll remember most.
Alright, time for some real talk about cash. Paris has a reputation for being expensive, and yes, it absolutely can be if you’re not careful. But it doesn’t have to break the bank!
Between the Orsay and the Louvre, I spent an entire afternoon at Café de Flore, just watching Paris go by. Three hours, two coffees, one glass of wine, and approximately 5,000 interesting characters later, I realized I’d just had one of the best experiences of my trip without doing anything at all.
A fashionable elderly woman at the table next to mine noticed me watching everyone and said in accented English, “The best art in Paris is the people, yes?” We ended up chatting for an hour about how she modeled for Dior in the 1960s. Marie, if you’re somehow reading this, you were the highlight of my trip!
Here’s what surprised me most: Paris isn’t perfect. And that’s what makes it perfect.
The metro sometimes smells questionable. Some waiters really are rude (though most aren’t if you attempt even terrible French). There are tourist traps and pickpockets and overpriced cafés.
But there’s also the bookseller along the Seine who gave me a free vintage postcard when I bought a worn copy of Hemingway. The baker who threw in an extra pain au chocolat “because you look hungry.” The stranger who walked me to my hotel when I got lost after midnight.
Paris isn’t a postcard; it’s a living, breathing city with mood swings and secrets and stories. It’s not always beautiful, but it’s always authentic. And that’s why I keep coming back.
So friends, has this convinced you to book that flight yet? Drop me a comment about your Paris dreams or questions, and I promise to answer every single one. Next week, I’ll be sharing my fool-proof packing list for a week in Paris with just a carry-on (yes, it’s possible, even for a chronic over-packer like me).
Until next time, remember what the French say: “La vie est belle, mais Paris la rend extraordinaire.” Life is beautiful, but Paris makes it extraordinary.
À bientôt! ✨

Paris, the most visited city in the world. There are many popular conceptions of Paris, some positive, others negative. There are those that say Paris is the most beautiful and romantic city on the planet, while others talk about how dirty the streets of Paris are and claim that Parisians are rude and the whole city is overrated. I fall more in the middle, leaning to the positive side. I think Paris is an amazing place, though it’s not my favorite in the world.
When I left the Paris-Nord train station, after taking a train from London that went through the English Channel, I immediately noticed major differences in mannerisms and behavior of the French compared to the English.
Although England is technically a foreign country, as an American it didn’t feel too different from the United States. Sure, the English speak in a different accent and use different phrases, but the common language and the cultural similarities made me feel like I wasn’t in a foreign land, even though I was.
When I was in France, however, I truly did feel that I was in foreign territory. One of the first things I noticed when I got out of the train station was that almost everyone was smoking cigarettes. The French also talked faster, and, from my experiences, had a different idea of personal space (not that it’s always a bad thing).

toThe term ‘Paris Syndrome’ was created in 1986 by professor Professor Hiroaki Ota. He explained it as ‘a severe shock that can require hospitalisation’.
Wait, there’s more.
According to this article from Huffington Post,
“The Japanese Embassy in Paris now has a 24-hour hotline for Japanese tourists suffering from the syndrome, whose symptoms can range from depression and anxiety to acute delusional states, dizziness, sweating, hallucinations and “feelings of persecution.”
The reason?
According to professor Mathieu Deflem from the University of South Carolina, it’s because of drastically different cultures and ‘unmet romantic expectations’.
I even have friends who’ve told me that they were disappointed in Paris, but here’s why I still love the city.
My first experience in Paris was when I was 21. My uncle and I were travelling to Paris and Milan, but I arrived a day early and was alone in Paris for the day.
What happened next was an incident that changed my life forever.
Going to cut the long story short.
I met a Syrian man via Couchsurfing. We met at the banks of the river La Seine where the locals were chilling. We just looked at the river and spoke. Between us was his airbag with local cheese, wine, homemade beetroot and classic hummus and pita bread.
He was a journalist and told me how he’s lost his home and a lot of his family.
In the middle of talking about the refugee incidents he has experienced and covered at work, what struck me was this particular sentence,
“You think your life is hard? Think about sitting in a boat and not knowing if you’ll ever see land again. Do this for days, and that life is hard.”
It changed my perspective on everything.
Here’s a detailed article about it if you want to read it later.
Even back then, there were certain challenges.
The menu was entirely in French. People wouldn’t respond in English. But you know what? I don’t see an issue with it.
I’m from India. And it’s painful to see how talking in English is a way of social stratification today. You’re automatically ‘cool’ and ‘well educated’ if you can talk fluently in English.
I mean… this is like Stockholm Syndrome.
When I visited Edinburgh Castle in Scotland, I saw how most jewels there belonged to the kings and queens of India. We were looted and ripped off so bad that we’re relatively poor even today. Yet, we cannot get out of our colonisation by pitting against each other.
The world doesn’t need to be fluent in English.
And here’s a trick that works if you really want the French to be nice to you.
Something that amused me was — each time I spoke in broken French, I got answers in fluent English.
But when I spoke in English, I just got cold nods.
It’s funny, but it underlines how showing a little bit of respect that you’re at least trying to talk in their language warms their heart. Warms mine too, when I see a foreigner speaking in Hindi.
Just saying ‘Bonjour’ can help.
Like everything else, it’s always the little things, isn’t it?
Another thing that helps regardless of the city is to be a traveler instead of a tourist.
Ditch tours, hop-in-hop-off, and the big shiny spots.
Walk into lanes of Montmartre, eat local breakfast, and let go of expensive tickets for the Eiffel view because the view is best enjoyed for free… by the river.
My mum and I visited Paris this August and sat here with some rosé and snacks and had a beautiful time watching the Eiffel light up at night. We also witnessed two proposals!
You don’t see this stuff paying 300 euros for an ‘Eiffel view’ table.
Talking about food, ditch your Instagram famous cafes.
I promise you, the bread you eat at a local boulangerie would be to die for. It’ll be fresh, soulful, and unlike any bread you’ve ever had.
I went to the famous cafe, Ladurée, and ordered eggs benedict. I paid 3.5 euros extra for spinach. Do you know what I got? Two brioches with a diameter of 2 cm and one small leaf of spinach on each.
It was such a tiny meal!
Meanwhile, here’s a local breakfast at a cafe:
France has made me fall in love with breads so much that I tried to find local bread in the 5 other countries I visited during my trip in August.
It’s worth the hype.
Paris is notorious for thefts and being unsafe. But each place has a reputation and as somebody who has solo travelled, I recommend you to follow the basics that you would anywhere else:
I’d follow this in Amsterdam, Berlin, and Melbourne too.
Doesn’t matter where you go, but being responsible for your own safety is better than being sorry later and blaming others.
Lastly, I’d like to end by — give everything a chance instead of dwelling on preconceived notions.
My biggest lesson while solo travelling at 21 was to view the world as a blank slate and let experiences fill in the colour.
I met a woman at a bus stop in Stockholm, Sweden. She was American-Chinese and first asked me if I’ll be ‘allowed’ to wear the dress I was wearing right now in India. I affirmed that obviously, I am. Why would I not be?
She told me that she’s always wanted to visit India, but it’s portrayed as being unsafe.
I swear, if you follow some protocols, it’s not unsafe at all. But if you do things which as a local even I won’t do, then it’s inviting trouble.
Paris is still romantic for couples and lovely for a family holiday. The people are warm, and the bread is even warmer.
Yes, some streets are dirty. But I’ve heard the same goes for New York and San Francisco.
Hop on to the other side, Champs-Élysées is so gorgeous.
Give places and people a chance. Don’t let media or a few bitter experiences fill your head.
Finally, try to explore like a local. That’s what differentiates tourists from travellers, in my opinion.

“It has bothered me all my life that I do not paint like everybody else.”
On the first Monday of summer, June 5, 1905, the Gare de Lyon train station teemed with fashionable Parisians preparing for their annual journey to the south of France. Only they preferred Côte d’Azur — like it was a club with an admissions committee, an invited guest list, a velvet rope, and a charming hostess waiting to welcome them. To them, paradise was a familiar word, wrapped in the routine and privilege of their opulent lives. They imagined strolling arm-in-arm down sunlit promenades, exchanging knowing glances with others who happened to look, dress, and speakl just like them. It was so comforting to be seated at seaside cafés, secure in one’s place — and equally certain that, beyond their tiny polished circle, little else really mattered. They were happy people, perhaps ridiculously so.
A different story awaited in the third-class compartment: thirty-six-year-old Henri Matisse wasn’t chasing the sun; he was escaping ruin. Although he too was once welcomed in Parisian society, he now wore a corduroy suit like a prison uniform, faded to a reddish-brown, and blending into the threadbare seat beneath him. He looked more vineyard worker than artist — save for the paintbox and collapsible easel at his feet. His face was etched with lines from sleepless nights and empty pockets, carrying the weight of three years of failure and rejection. This was the new Henri Matisse, one who had aged and fallen. Had you whispered to his fellow passengers that one day he would shake the art world to its core the laughter would have been raucous and infectious.
Even his wife, Amélie, who sat next to him, would give you a skeptical glance. Even her expression was tense with quiet concern, and this was no leisurely getaway to the Riviera. The couple wasn’t bound for seaside promenades serenaded by Mediterranean breezes. They had no home to go to, and no friends when they arrived. In fact were escaping a life that had unraveled, fleeing to a place that might offer at least a reprieve from despair if not the justice system.
Matisse’s fall from grace had been sharp. The Parisian art world once welcomed him with cautious optimism, but now turned its delicate pale back. Friends disappeared, patrons closed their wallets, and a once-promising career had sputtered. It was his fault, too. Rumors of a financial scandal hovered around him like a thick fog, deepening his isolation. Once a successful lawyer, Matisse abandoned that career to follow his passion for painting, but now even that seemed as enticing as a wet pavement.
As the train pulled out of the station, leaving behind the familiar smells of crusty baguettes, pungent cheeses, and steaming bowls of oxtail soup, Matisse cast a final glance at his former home. He was leaving behind more than Paris; he was abandoning a world that seemed so full of promise, now reduced to broken dreams. Yet, as the train chugged along the tracks, his mood astonishingly began to lift. Amid the despair, a quiet resolve began to take root. The storm within him receded as Matisse made a vow — he would find his voice again, silence the doubts, and reclaim his life on his own terms.
No matter how long it took.
Which is what is so ironic about the story of Henri Matisse in Collioure. Little did he or anyone else realize that in just 100 days, this trek south would not only transform his career but reshape the entire art world, leading to one of the most revolutionary periods in the history of painting.
In fact, Paris would never look at a canvas the same way again.
But what was about to happen wasn’t a miracle nor an act of faith. It was something deeper and perhaps more fundamental to the human condition. Henri Matisse was about to discover a Thrive Zone — a place where the spirit is liberated, creativity reignited, and the soul is fully restored. These are places where we become ourselves in spite of the rest of the world telling us not to be.
This is the story of how one summer in a small fishing village in the south of France set the stage for a transformation that would forever alter Matisse — and leave an indelible mark on the world of art.
“There are flowers everywhere for those who want to see them.”
A cynic would say every form of refuge has its a price. For Henri Matisse, his career suffered from entrapment in the bleak industrial landscape of Normandy. As a young boy growing up there, life was marked by the unrelenting grayness, suffocated by coal dust. He believed the world was colored in sodden skies, and monotony was the color of choice. Matisse would later recall, “Women wore black, and everyone wore a hat. It is a place where people don’t expect too many strangers.”
Even Art historian Hilary Spurling noted this was true, his early works were “restrained and traditional,” lacking the spark that would later come to define his painting. Only the public wasn’t interested in somber landscapes — it craved beauty, spectacle, and illusion.
Desperate for cash, Matisse even offered one of his canvases to his brother Auguste for 100 francs. The reply was as frigid as the Norman winter: “I’d rather have a new bicycle.” But the struggle was about more than selling paintings. Matisse was caught in a larger battle, a fight to find his place in a world that seemed hopelessly duplicitous and divided. He valued integrity in expression more than wealth, but now he was bereft of both.
Born in 1869 during the twilight of the Victorian era, Matisse’s formative years spanned the Belle Époque — a time of shimmering contradictions. Paris, the “City of Light,” was both a beacon of modernity and a place of deep inequality as well as rigid social structure. The elite lived in the glow of freshly minted francs, while the working classes toiled in the shadows. The surface gleamed, but underneath, resentment simmered.
It was into this paradoxical cauldron, where new industrial fortunes clashed with the remnants of old-world aristocracy, that Matisse and his wife Amélie found themselves thrust — while the working classes — barely literate, and so barely counted — were left to their laughter, tobacco pipes, and homemade plum wine. The glittering surface of society masked deep divisions — while the elite flaunted their wealth, resentment simmered among the lower classes.
It was how the Matisse’s became collateral damage in one of the most infamous financial scandals of their time — the Humbert Affair. A master manipulator named Thérèse Humbert had defrauded thousands through an audacious Ponzi scheme, borrowing nearly 100 million francs based on the collateral of a fictitious inheritance. By sheer misfortune, the Matisse family became entangled.
Matisse’s father in law was arrested, and the artist, a former lawyer, came to his defense. He wasn’t a conspirator, but the scandal stained his reputation and he became swept up in the deluge. And as the Humbert empire crumbled, so too did the Matisse’s stature. He found himself facing public outrage and financial ruin.
Stripped of dignity and resources, the couple with their inlaws had to fleeParis, no longer sure of their place in the world. Yet, what they sought in the south wasn’t luxury — it was something else, renewal it would turn out. Matisse was no longer simply searching for a place to escape; he was searching for a space to thrive.
“We ought to view ourselves with the same curiosity and openness with which we study a tree, the sky or a thought.”
Thérèse Humbert was the architect of one of the most notorious frauds in French history. Her rise to the top of Parisian society had been built on audacious lies, and equally fake noble lineage. To bolster her imagined wealth, she concocted an elaborate story about saving the life of a fictional American millionaire, Robert Crawford, who, according to her story, had gratefully left her a vast fortune. For over two decades, Humbert borrowed millions against this supposed inheritance, living a life of luxury while her lenders, many of them ordinary citizens, were left in the dark.
Through a web of deceit that had gone undetected for years — protected by her father-in-law, a Minister of Justice — Humbert finally acquired a newspaper owned by Armand Parayre, Henri Matisse’s father-in-law. This tangled connection dragged the Matisse family into the scandal’s orbit, even though they were unwitting victims themselves. But when the supposed inheritance was revealed to be nothing but a single red brick, the scandal erupted and scapegoats were needed.
France was outraged. The Humberts fled, leaving ruin in their wake. And while Matisse and his family although not accomplices, were tainted by their association. It took very little time before they found themselves swept up in the aftermath of one of the country’s largest Ponzi schemes.
The financial ruin, public scandal, and professional rejection that surrounded Matisse pushed him further toward collapse. No longer able to support his family or continue his art with any hope of stability, Matisse felt crushed by the weight of his failures. The Parisian society that had once nurtured his ambition now seemed intent on devouring him.
Yet, in the face of this disaster, the fall became the prelude to something greater.
The seeds of transformation were planted.
“I would like to recapture that freshness of vision which is characteristic of extreme youth when all the world is new to it.”
Sometimes, utter rejection is the precursor of renewal. For Matisse, this state of affairs forced him to seek refuge not just from scandal and poverty, but from the creative limitations he had unknowingly imposed on himself. Desperate and exhausted, Matisse and his wife Amélie left Paris for a small fishing village near the Spanish border.
Collioure wasn’t St. Tropez as they couldn’t afford the luxuries of the French Riviera that Paris’s elite were accustomed to. Instead, they found themselves in a fishing village hit hard by economic ruin and the collapse of its anchovy trade and vineyards, ravaged by the Phylloxera plague. The town, at first glance, appeared worn, scarred by decline and poverty.
Yet to Matisse, it held something far more precious than wealth.
“The light here is different,” Matisse would later say.
It wasn’t just an illusion either. Collioure had unfiltered Mediterranean light that revealed colors that Matisse had never seen before — due to the only East facing coastline in France where the Pyranees majestically seem to dive into the water. The reflections of the sea, the interplay of light and shadow, the vivid hues that soaked into the village streets — became his metaphor. A light which casts no shadows and eradicates contrasts. It was a new artistic language, one that spoke to him in a way that Paris never could.
Where others saw a town in decline, Matisse saw a world bursting with possibility. The decay of the fishing industry and the blighted vineyards faded into the background. For the first time in years, Matisse felt a spark of creative energy return. His focus shifted away from survival and toward the rediscovery of beauty.
The transition was profound. In Paris, Matisse had been trapped in a world of muted tones, of compromise and caution. But in Collioure, he began to embrace boldness, color, and exuberance. The sun-drenched hues of the Mediterranean landscape — lavenders, blues, deep reds, and oranges — burst into his work, freeing him from the restraint that had shackled his earlier paintings.
This was no accident. Collioure had become more than just a change of scenery; it had become Matisse’s personal Thrive Zone.
A Thrive Zone isn’t just a place to live or work; it’s a place where one’s potential is not only nurtured but liberated. It’s an environment where time takes on a different momentum, allowing creativity, growth, and transformation to flourish.
In Collioure, Matisse found exactly that — a space where the constraints of his old life could no longer bind him, where his art could breathe and expand beyond anything he had imagined in Paris.
“What I dream of is an art of balance, of purity and serenity, devoid of troubling or depressing subject matter, something like a good armchair.”
The pinnacle of this transformation came in the form of one of Matisse’s first works of the summer of 1905 appropriately titled, Open Window, Collioure. It wasn’t just a painting — it was a declaration of freedom that overcame him as he gazed from his hotel window.
In this work, Matisse blurred the boundaries between interior and exterior, between the familiar and the unknown. The colors — vivid and alive — reflected his internal transformation. Where traditional art sought to mimic life, Matisse’s work was life, vibrating with the energy of the Mediterranean.
Gone were the muted tones and tight brushstrokes that had once defined his work. In Collioure, Matisse embraced a radical new approach to color and form. His brushstrokes were loose, unrestrained, and alive. This work wasn’t just a product of technique, he was the same artist he had been in Paris just a week earlier — it was the product of an environment.
The vibrant colors of Collioure found their way into the depth of Matisse’s discouragement, and for the first time in his life, he felt free to paint in a way that was entirely his own. The shift was so dramatic that it left the Parisian art world stunned. Open Window and the thirty other paintings Matisse completed that summer heralded the birth of Fauvism, a revolutionary movement that would redefine modern art.
In one summer in 1905 he would paint over 50 pieces, and three of the ten greatest works of his life. Of course, the critics in Paris, accustomed to the soft realism of the old masters, were appalled. Matisse’s use of color was too wild, his forms too chaotic. His work was dubbed “Fauvism,” meaning “wild beasts,” a derogatory term meant to criticize the audacity of the movement.
But Matisse, like the light of Collioure, was undeterred. He had found his Thrive Zone, and he would never again return to the constraints of his old life.
“You can’t help getting old, but you can help becoming old.”
Henri Matisse once said, “There are flowers for those who want to see them.” But perhaps the deeper question isn’t why we see flowers — but who plants them in the first place. In Collioure, Matisse found not just refuge but renewal. Freed from the biting skepticism of Parisian critics who had dismissed his work as “scribblings of a wild beast,” he discovered a simpatico community — comrades who shared his love of nature and painted alongside him, as well as villagers who embraced his curious habit of standing before a canvas all day. Among them, he painted with abandon, as if creating art were play, not work.
For him, the humble fishing village was more than a refuge from Parisian humidity or a place of cheap lodgings. It was where the “flowers” of creativity were planted — a nurturing environment that welcomed his restless, rebellious spirit and spoke to his innermost feelings and beliefs.
Mornings spent painting in a modest studio overlooking the beach flowed effortlessly into afternoons of fish stew and Picpoul de Pinet. The Mediterranean light transformed the village’s modest facades into shimmering mosaics of lavender, red, and blue. Even the coarse shouts of fishermen, carried on salt-laden breezes in ancient Occitan, held an unexpected poetry.
What Matisse found in Collioure wasn’t merely an inspirational technique — it was a shift in his approach to life and art. He was no longer bound by the expectations of Parisian society or trapped by the weight of public opinion. The unpretentious simplicity of the village loosened the grip of doubt, reigniting his confidence and freeing him to create on his own terms. In this overlooked corner of the Mediterranean, Matisse found his muse, his sanctuary, and, ultimately, his transformation.
Not long after, he settled permanently in nearby Nice, drawn by the same energy that had unlocked his potential in Collioure — a place where he would spend the rest of his days until age 84.
Matisse’s story exemplifies a universal truth: the right environment can unlock potential in ways that talent or ambition alone cannot. It is the fusion of place, purpose, and opportunity that creates the conditions for extraordinary success. Yet finding such a place is only part of the journey. Liberating oneself from the constraints of our current environment — from the doubts, the criticisms, the expectations, and the customs that bind us — is often the greater challenge. To do so requires stunning independence and personal leadership.
Matisse left Paris at age 36 a struggling artist. He returned three months later transformed — his confidence renewed, his technique revolutionized, and his reputation on the rise.
Within a season, he had become a rival to Picasso. Collioure was more than a village; it was the point where talent and opportunity converged, where greatness and place became inseparable. Collioure, then, was not just a haven — it was Matisse’s Thrive Zone.

Paris — the city that has inspired poets, artists, and dreamers for centuries. During my recent 3-day trip to this enchanting metropolis, I found myself swept away not only by its breathtaking landmarks and rich history but also by the subtle yet fascinating retail trends that reflect the Parisian way of life. From cobblestone streets lined with boutiques to bustling markets showcasing local craftsmanship, Paris offers a perfect blend of tradition and modernity.
In this article, I’ll take you through my 3-day itinerary while highlighting the travel insights and retail observations I made along the way. Whether you’re planning a trip to Paris or simply curious about the city’s evolving trends, this guide will give you a taste of what makes Paris so timeless — and yet so contemporary.
My journey began in Montmartre, the bohemian heart of Paris. This historic district, perched on a hill overlooking the city, is a haven for artists and romantics alike. Walking through its winding streets felt like stepping into a painting.
Montmartre is home to an eclectic mix of vintage shops and contemporary boutiques. What stood out to me was how these stores seamlessly blend old-world charm with modern sensibilities. From retro-inspired dresses to handmade jewelries, Montmartre’s retail scene celebrates individuality — a hallmark of French fashion.
If Day 1 was about soaking in Montmartre’s artistic vibe, Day 2 was all about exploring Paris’s iconic landmarks and indulging in its culinary delights.
The Latin Quarter offers a treasure trove of independent bookstores (like Shakespeare & Company) and artisan shops selling everything from handmade soaps to custom stationery. What struck me most was how these small businesses prioritise authenticity and quality over mass production — a trend that seems to resonate deeply with both locals and tourists.
For my final day in Paris, I ventured beyond the city centre to explore some royal grandeur and hidden gems that added new dimensions to my understanding of Parisian culture.
The Marais district stood out for its diversity — it’s where high-end fashion boutiques coexist with vintage stores and quirky concept shops. This juxtaposition reflects a broader trend in Parisian retail culture: catering to diverse tastes while maintaining an emphasis on quality and craftsmanship.
As someone who loves observing cultural nuances through shopping experiences, I couldn’t help but notice some key retail trends during my trip:

In my opinion, most restaurants in the world would qualify as good not great, and very few are truly excellent. When I travel, I put in hours of research to try to find the great and excellent restaurants. Luckily, there are plenty of amazing options in Paris. I always wish I had more days and more stomach space to continue exploring. While I was happy with most of my picks from my recent trips in 2024 and 2023, some were clear misses. Of course you never know when a restaurant is having an off day or if you ordered the wrong things or if you were just too full or too tired to really appreciate it. Since I’ve only been to most of these places one time, I would not completely write off any of them if you hear good things from someone else. However, I will personally not be returning to the ones I say to skip!

We came to France to visit Nantes, where my son lives. But I would love to travel to Paris too, so we will stay here for two days and then go to Nantes. We must stop in Paris and taste it again. But we end up in a food coma. We are going to cram Paris in just two days. But this time around, I found something unexpected.
The skies were clear as we landed at Charles de Gaulle airport. Our United flight 990 was unexpectedly impressive. They fed us terrible food the entire time, but the staff was friendly. Get a cab to town next; don’t take the Metro with all your heavy bags after the long trip. We did that once and deeply regretted it. Make sure you find the official ones, which are found at sortie 24. Don’t fall for the gypsies.
We rented an Air B&B in Le Marais at Rue Vielles de Temple. Usually, the pictures look better, but this one was the exact opposite. If you rent an Air B&B when you travel to Paris, remember to arrange for the owner to meet at the door because, unlike in the United States, you can’t just get there, get a code, and get in. In most cases.
After settling in the apartment, we walked through Le Marais. It was quite an experience because you find yourself in a different world, and the contrast back home gives you a buzz…

Yesterday I went across Paris with a driver called Abderrazak. I had to go from Paris Orly airport all the way to Charles de Gaulle on the other side of the city, where the international airport is located and stay overnight before taking our Cathay Pacific flight back to Hong Kong.
My daughters fell asleep after a long day travelling from the Canary Islands, so I started to chat with the stranger in command. I am usually guilty of pulling out my iPhone every time I have a break but this time, I decided to live in the real world, and leave my digital life in my pocket.
I found out Abde was born in Paris to Algerian parents who emigrated from Oran to France for a better life, like many others in the 60’s, once the French occupation of Algeria ended.
Although he feels French and has only been to Algeria on holidays, he said people are not satisfied when he says he is French.
Even though his passport says his place of birth is Roissy (in Paris), his darker look and Arab name raise suspicious eyebrows.

I’m sitting at the Air France Lounge at Charles De Gaulle, pulling down episode two of Studio 60 over the wi-fi so I can watch it on the flight back, and figured I’d do a little blogging while I’m at it. I’ve been in Paris the past two days to do a speech for Disney, which means, of course, that I fly all the way from New York to Paris and then I’m immediately taken to Paris Disneyland, where they’ve put me up in the “New York” hotel. Of all the Baudrillardian ironies…
I’ve done a lot of these two day trips to foreign cities in recent years: Lisbon, Hong Kong, Paris, Hamburg, Amsterdam, London many times. They can be a little exhausting, but I’ve grown fond of the routine. There’s no time to actually try to see anything systematically, no time even to really acclimate to the place. So I basically just try to take a half day and evening, and just walk around with no real destination, letting the natural flow of the city direct me. In cities that I know quite well, like London or Paris, the fun of it is in figuring out the limits of my knowledge, in others it’s more of a process of discovery. And I always try to have some new music that I’ve just downloaded, to listen to on the iPod as a soundtrack. It embeds this lovely — and enduring — connection between the music and the memory of a place…
But enough about all that — SARAH JESSICA PARKER is sitting right next to me in the Lounge!! Does Gawker have a Paris edition?

Over two decades, I’ve reviewed more books about France than any non-English speaking country. So, I suspect, have most critics.
Writers were heading for the cafés and boulevards of Paris more than a century before Snoop Dogg carried the Olympic torch through the streets of the City of Light, and literature is the richer for it.
James Baldwin went there to escape American racism. Ernest Hemingway arrived as a correspondent for the Toronto Daily Star. Edith Wharton first visited the city as child and eventually felt so at home that she spent the last three decades of her life there. She explained the allure of Paris with a line that translates to, “I have it in my blood.”
So many writers have had the same blood disease that the city has inspired good books in a vast number of genres of fiction and nonfiction for adults or children. The abundance could make you say: Mon Dieu!
Where do you start looking for one?
Other critics might urge you to begin with a masterwork. But I never finished Proust’s In Search of Lost Time after…

PORTLAND IS MY PARIS
This weekend the city isn’t an option. My head needs to be cleared by things green and blue and misty, so the men on East 80th rent me a cherry-juice Kia Forte and I merge onto Manhattan’s rush hour traffic. It’s been three days since I picked the spot, arranged for a car and room and a brief search on things to do. Half-because a music producer told me it’s a nice place, half-because it’s a 6-hour drive if I go toll-free, which I like.
I pull off in Worcester for relief and caffeine. Sky-high dark and stormies have been chasing me since my tires hit the Massachusetts state line, and I am counting on the break for them to sort themselves. I corner off on Madison Street. Memories of grey-blue Renegades, rolling bike paths, Mormon propaganda on flat screens, the spindly tree on State St, 50+ missed calls go by - I am on the wrong side of the station for the rental’s pump, despite looking directly at the dash.
Ghosts living and dead have been following me lately; my life has turned into a marathon of goodbyes. I passed a man identical to Owen by Union Square after work yesterday — my brain remembered he’s been dead since January only after it recognized the face. (I’m editing this now in Boston, a stone’s throw from where we went on drives, where I clasped a golden chain twice looped around his wrist).
Returning the comically-large restroom key, jostling against the counter with its grotesque embody, I trade the phosphorescent lovingly-scratched lotto ticket I won back in February, cashed in for two cokes and a fistful of change, and don’t think about how much has changed since then, either. There are narratives you choose, to save most of your mind from obsession. There are words I take care not to write as doing so risks more of me than I could take. I post that I like to keep my cash options in winning tickets and send my dad the new ETA, pushed back 10 minutes.
(The coffee machine in my hotel room is haunted. It’s gurgling foaming with hot water but none goes to where my grounds are. Half-done, trying, hot, not enough. I put the mug with a tea bag in and dump the hot water from the mouth of the machine in, scalding some fingers and toes. Get it done, be creative, keep it moving).
Pulled from a drunken slumber, bedsheets indented into my cheeks, I gather hot coffee from the lobby to save myself further scorching, and wander cobblestone-padded streets, my shoes fitting not-to-neatly between the stones. Not much is open so early but enough are awake, townies and regulars who are glad for the company and small talk chatter. My list of places to visit grows, although I know readily I won’t see so much as half of them, it’s a bit addicting to play the part of traveler. I appreciate feeling temporary.
After reassurance from the daughter of a shop-owner that the rain, if anything, enhances the landscape more than derails - I swing into the cherry-red and take myself out to lighthouses and state parks, $7 for outsiders. My dad chats with me on the way, he’s seemed worried about me as of late and I can’t quite stop his fears from spilling over. It’s raining and I am pleased and calm and miserable altogether.
There isn’t an easy way to explain how I’m doing, and most people don’t ask beyond politeness. I tell confidants what I believe to be my best wording. I say I wish I could control the pain, let the psychedelic-drunk swinging punches into transit air land one, let the bruise prove. They say to stop, that I’m no longer being funny.
I can’t find the right order of words to explain how untrue it is that I’m doing well, because I have not adopted the socially acceptable behaviors of someone not doing well. I work, I shower, but I am not there. I am tethered by a thread - the kind one absentmindedly pulls at on their knit sweaters or worn skirts, slowly raveling around a finger until the pressure snaps. The base is rooted in the platelets spanning my hips, right where my spine becomes body.
My mind plans for when my body no longer does what it should. For when it morphs into the shapeless entity folks imply I am not when they say, “You seem to be handling all of this well.” I don’t need compliments, I need someone to want to sit with me in the madness under pale moons. I fear I rip the good things in my life to prove I can, and in flashes I see it happening. All I’ve been feeling lately is silent.
A, another, before and after has formed. My life as thin as Bible pages, divided into histories, plays, songs, poems, scrawled pages of repetitive obsessive YOU ARE ALIVE as a mantra to remember I don’t have a choice but continue. Divisions occur and I am spectator and recipient, captivated by my continual disbelief in how I’ve gotten it wrong, I have lost a little bit more once again, nothing was mine to begin with.
My fingers freeze around a half-fist, curled around my umbrella (the one I’ll forget in a coffee chain by Union Square a week later), before I decide to call it quits and head back to the hobbled groupings of urban life within Portland. I have been (perhaps, in-error) working to keep the love I have, is what I’m gathering, that in American fashion I believe the luxuries of complacency can only bring calamity. Rosy-cheeked angels in rustic basement bars will warp into stonewalls, I should let them thin out the strings of this thread if that’s what they’d like to do.
I drink, and some more at Papi Portland. I shake off two dirt smeared men who follow me across Fore and Congress streets. I get two steps into a speakeasy before giving up at the third, unable to bring myself to swinging open unmarked doors. A psychic calls me back, meets me twenty minutes later to tell me what I already know, but she’s kind and doesn’t push too hard her enrollment program to unearth my generational curse. Now knowingly burdened with ancestors' fuckups, I trod along.
I bring the girl with me back to Brooklyn, who had such pleasures in bringing ghosts’ particulars by frame in conversations with strangers. I have built up an instinct that must now go ignored, muscles I’ve worked for years. I’m not promised anything, comforts or friends or family, do I close myself off for reprieve? How do I take this in, swallow and be someone I like?
I succumb to a sense of shyness once I feel known; how bold I am as a stranger, how timid I am the more I open. How do I feel destined for apathy but have hope for more?
There is a strip club, Mickey’s, directly on the border of the Rhode Island state line. Beer buckets advertised on-sale, void parking lots. Middle of a suburban neighborhood, some moments feel significant for nothing. Escape is temporary, my loves and losses circle back as haunting, as companions. But I have time and myself, constant motion brings perspective across the multitudes of lives as deep and complex, horrible and lonely as I fear mine to be.
I follow ghosts back, I live where my mother was born. I look at shelves Owen, inky bare skin and the kindest smile crinkled-eyes, installed in my room less than a year before, I don’t think about moving. The mind isn’t forever, either - I’ll forget eventually, the street names and phrasings and fights. I hope I won’t forget what I’ve loved, immortalized in menial tombs.
Life is patient back in Brooklyn for me to see the bigger picture, to see the schism of light. I daydream about when I crack, as foretold, as if that will bring understanding through manmade anxieties. I envision it’ll unlock something, unlodge so I feel lighter, free fall with ribbons of my grief momentarily wings. The day will come, I promise, I’m hoping for Revelations.

Helping You Adapt to Life in France

When I moved to Paris in 2013 one of the first things I did was obtain a Navigo card and after a couple months of buying monthly passes manually via machines I switched to an annual pass and have not had to think about topping up again. The metro was the way I moved about Paris.
But after getting to know the Metro fairly well you realize that it’s often just as easy to walk to a certain location and you start making choices about what form of transportation makes the most sense given the weather, your mood, what you’re carrying, and what else you still need to accomplish. Velib was already around when I arrived in 2013 and the shared bike boom followed by the rise in trottinette usage meant that options for transport have only multiplied since then. The one form of transport that has received an explosive infusion of support from local government is bicycles.
Now that bike lanes are so well-established in Paris, I wonder how so many of us were brave enough to ride with vehicle traffic for many years prior. Cars and their drivers, convinced that everyone but them were simply “intruding” on their entitled space, didn’t make life easy for those of us on bicycles, but we figured that was simply the way it would be. I mean, this wasn’t Amsterdam after all. But little did most of us know that the Dutch model was…

I stepped out on a cold, damp January morning to walk to the nearby supermarket for groceries. When I reached, I realized I had forgotten my phone.
My language handicap gnawing at me as I needed the French-English translation app I was using.
I didn’t speak a word of French, which wasn’t ‘Bonjour’, ‘Merci’ or ‘Au revoir’ back then. I was looking for salt at the supermarket.
It was the start of 2016. I had just moved to Paris. For a couple of months, my husband’s MBA hostel became our abode. He was pursuing his MBA at HEC Paris back then.
And I was tagging along while continuing to do my old job from Paris.
“There is but one Paris and however hard living may be here…the French air clears up the brain and does one good.”- Vincent van Gogh
The HEC campus was brilliant. I got a first-hand insight into the top MBA college experience.
There were parties, partner engagement group activities, gym, and lectures. With time, we found an elite group of friends to hang out with. This brought in the feeling of ‘a home away from home’.

‘You have any idea if I can use this coupon or do I have to put a coin in?’
‘Ma’am I’ve got no idea. I’m just trying to get to the toilet.’
Apple pay worked on the second try, and the turnstile swung open to the sordid men’s room of the Gare du Nord station. I paid and I pissed. I rejoined mum in the queue for the self-operated ticket machine, which we eventually summitted, only to find all 3 out of order. Stranded in the underground of one of Paris’ busiest stations, fearing for our lives, we sought concord by the help desk.
I’d had far from a glowing first impression — I figured I was already starting to buy into the Paris syndrome — the heightened expectations. The inevitable letdown.
I had hardly been won over on the way here. The views from the Eurostar had been, actually, short of spectacular.
‘I’m pretty sure we just popped out the tunnel in France. Looks like England but worse.’
What I didn’t realise, as I complained to my girlfriend about the Merville countryside, was that France doesn’t just look like England. Just like home, France is a parasite. Slums feeding off the prestige of the capital. Like London, Paris is a very rich city attached to an otherwise lacklustre country.
I’d seen and dismissed the outskirts, the prefabs enlivened by graffiti and the…

Paris is easily one of the most recognizable cities in the world; known universally for its iconic Eiffel Tower. The tower indeed has its towering presence (no pun intended), but the city has a lot more to offer. It is full of monuments signifying its rich history of ambitious emperors to tyrannical monarchs — each one left their indelible mark on the city.
When we were deciding on a place to visit in December, we didn’t have high expectations from it, assuming it would be damp and cold in winter. But thankfully, the weather stayed sunny on most days even though it was cold.
Eiffel Tower was built as an entrance to the 1889 World’s Fair in Paris. It was the tallest structure ever built at that time. But when built, it was criticized for its design for it is very different than typical Parisian architecture and really stands out.
To be honest, at first, it didn’t seem particularly impressive when I saw it. But like a good french wine, the tower eventually grows on you. After a few days, having climbed up by its stairs in the evening, walk past it during the sunrise and sunset, see it glimmer in the light, it’s hard not to be captivated by its presence around you in the area.
I am guessing that’s what happened to Parisians as well. The tower was intended to be dismantled in 1909, but it was never brought down and it is still standing tall now as an icon of this beautiful city.
For an admirer of arts, Paris is definitely one of the top destinations. But like me, even if you’re also clueless why some paintings get so much attention — you will still find plenty to admire in its museums. It has something for everyone.
Situated in the heart of the city the Lourve palace, once one of the world’s largest palace was a royal residence of the French kings for 300 years, before it was stormed by the revolutionists during the French revolution. Today it is one of the world’s largest art museum boasting collection of arts from ancient Greeks to Leonardo da Vinci.
About a mile away from Lourve is one of my favorite buildings in the city, Palais Garnier or the Opera House of Paris. Built as a central venue for the bustling arts scene of the city, the interior murals, staircase and foyers are extra-ordinarily opulent and similar to the Palace of Versailles.
For centuries, Paris attracted several artists from all kinds of backgrounds to the city. Like the Medicis of Florence during the Renaissance, the Bourbon kings also commissioned several monuments and paintings inspired from Greek and Roman influence. Even before them, the famous Leonardo spent his final years in France working for the then French monarch.
The murals and paintings at the grand staircase and the foyer are so rich that it is hard not to confuse it with some royal palace. But it is truly a palace celebrating the achievements of arts of the city.
Similar to London, one can spend days visiting the museums in Paris. We only had a chance to visit the Lourve and Musée d’Orsay, which is famous for its relatively modern and impressionist paintings from Van Gogh and Monet.
With such a vast repository of world’s most iconic art collection and architectural buildings, it is not surprising it also called the City of Art and even today attracts many artists and art enthusiasts alike.
With some of the best works of arts and architecture in the city, it is not hard to imagine that some of the most beautiful chapels and cathedrals are also in Paris.
We didn’t get to visit Notre Dame because of the renovations from the fire, but Sainte-Chapelle and Sacré-Cœur were equally awe-inspiring.
At Sainte-Chapelle, one can stand marveling at the details of the massive stained glass windows for hours and wonder how such an amazing feat was achieved by people in the12th and14th centuries.
Sacré-Cœur is equally beautiful in its own regard. Slightly away from the main city in the neighborhood of Montmartre, it can still make its presence felt elsewhere as it is built on the highest hill of Paris.
France has had a tumultuous history of shifting powers. The kings of the medieval era were extremely lavish. Eventually, the people revolted against them and publicly executed them during the French Revolution. Then the new king Napoleon Bonaparte expanded French borders but was eventually ousted by an alliance of old kings with foreign powers. They were removed again and the power shifted a few times before a stable constitutional government was instituted.
As with most places, a lot of famous monuments were built in Paris during the reign of its monarchs and most notably in this case during the reign of House of Bourbon and House of Bonaparte. Today, they are popular tourist places but back then they were symbols of absolute power they held over their subjects and sung about their victories over foreign nations comparing them to the Greek or Roman Gods.
Of all the Bourbon kings, Louis XIV centralized the most power and ruled over the unprecedented glory of France of medieval Europe. He truly believed he was one of the gods and assumed the title of the Sun King and was depicted as Apollo — Greek God of the Sun in his paintings and murals.
During his reign, he converted a small hunting chateau into one of the grandest palaces on Earth — the Palace of Versailles. Today the palace is a museum, but back then it was a symbol of absolute power the kings held with its gilded interiors, exteriors, and fountains and paintings often comparing them to the Greek and Roman Gods in their conquests.
One of the most striking features of the palace is the Hall of Mirrors containing gilded walls and statues with glass chandeliers in it. When built in the 17th century, glass was considered as one of the most expensive commodity and its manufacturing was almost monopolized by Venice. The architect brought several workers from Italy to manufacture them in France.
Following the fall of Bourbons in the French Revolution, the Napoleons became rulers of France (with Bourbons taking over again for sometime) and expanded its empire and repository of palaces and monuments.
Walking on the streets of Paris it is easy to get lost in the history of the city beginning from the first settlement by the Romans around 2000 years ago into a world-icon that it is today.
After spending 5 days here, we got a chance to experience some of its rich history of art and architecture through its museums and monuments. Even after that, it feels like we only scratched the surface of what the city has to offer. But it was time for us to move on to our next destination Barcelona and Andalusia — a region which is equally unique and diverse in its art, architecture, culture, and history.

Paris is one of the most visited cities in the world, but you will enjoy your stay more if you understand the complicated toilet culture. Parisien toilets are almost as diverse as the French cheeses, and the etiquette for using them can be confusing for a first-time visitor. I have taken 20 student groups to Paris, and I always tell my students to use a bathroom when they see one so there are fewer emergency situations.
Let me help you with what you need to know.
In the Louvre. In the main lobby under the stairs there are free bathrooms. The bathroom at the food court costs 50 centimes, and there is a bathroom that claims to be the cleanest in Paris. This bathroom is the most expensive. Obviously, you should use the free bathroom, but it helps you to know what to expect from the other two.
In the Luxembourg gardens. There are free bathrooms in the front to the left, at the back, and in the middle near the tennis court. It is expected for you to leave a small tip at the counter. I usually leave 20–50 centimes.
Public street bathrooms. There are public bathrooms on the street that look like spaceships. You will need change. They self-clean in between use, so wait for the green light.
In Cafés. If you need to use the bathroom in a café, you should buy something. You usually don’t need to pay in a café. Sometimes the owner will give you a jeton to use as a coin.
Although they are a rarity now, you might find a type of bathroom called Napoleon. It is two feet separated by a hole. When you flush make sure to step away from the feet because the water will wash over the feet.
I hope these suggestions help you to understand the bathroom culture.

Paris may be known as the city of love, but it’s also a city known for its fashion, if Emily in Paris has anything to say about it. As one of the “Big Four” fashion weeks (alongside New York, Milan, and London), Paris has cemented its legacy as the epicenter of haute couture and ready-to-wear collections.
Paris Fashion Week is an event that kickstarts trends off the runways and into retail stores and wardrobes globally. Here’s what you should know about it:
Paris Fashion Week wasn’t always as famous as it is now. Back in 1973, the French Fashion Federation established it as an official event to showcase the country’s unparalleled sartorial talent. But you’d be surprised to know that Paris’s love affair with high fashion goes back a long way.
In the 17th century, Louis XIV, also known as the Sun King, played an influential role in elevating France’s reputation for luxury fashion. The monarchy’s patronage of the textile industries and ateliers established Paris as a global destination for style and sophistication.
By the 19th century, the arrival of Charles Frederick Worth (considered to be the father of haute couture) solidified France’s dominance when it came to fashion. His maison became a pilgrimage site for royalty and aristocracy. It also ended up laying the groundwork for Parisian fashion houses that are revered today — including Chanel and Dior. French fashion dresses became the trend, stemming from the fact that France became known for its quality, style, and elegance.
Paris Fashion Week might be synonymous with sophistication, but its real value lies in its diversity. It’s where avant-garde designers share the stage with heritage brands, creating a rich tapestry of styles and narratives. The event has two objectives: to present haute couture and ready-to-wear styles that speak to elites and everyday fashion enthusiasts, but also to set the tone for trends in the coming year.
Haute couture, which Paris exclusively champions, is an art form in itself. Each piece is generally handcrafted, taking hundreds of hours in craftsmanship alone. Designers like Christian Dior redefine feminine forms and designs, while other designers challenge history and society’s rules for what fashion should be. In the ready-to-wear segment, Paris outshines many other fashionable cities, due to designers pushing boundaries while maintaining elegance and structure in their clothing.
Paris Fashion Week’s influence on global trends is unparalleled. Each season, designers debut collections that reflect cultural shifts, technological advancements, and environmental consciousness. From the rising popularity of gender-neutral fashion and artisanal clothing to the integration of sustainable practices, Paris runways are a microcosm of broader societal ideals.
Think about the past Paris Fashion Weeks — there was a time when fashion was all about the classic silhouette. But during Fashion Weeks in the 2010s, this notion was dispelled. Designers like Maria Grazia Chiuri and Virginie Viard breathed new life into traditional forms, blending history with modernity while retaining sophistication. Paris Fashion Week is also an event where it is consistently proved that fashion isn’t just about wearable clothing — it’s also about conceptual art.
Many people believe that Paris Fashion Week is only about showcasing French designers, but that’s not the case at all. It’s a global platform that celebrates talent from around the world. Many designers see it as an award of sorts because it is the ultimate stage to attain recognition. This is also a stage for established brands to reaffirm their status and gain brand retention among their customer base.
The event also acts as a launchpad for emerging designers. Initiatives like the ANDAM Fashion Award spotlight fresh talent. It gives budding designers the opportunity to present their work to an audience of industry leaders, buyers, and journalists. These platforms are monumental in shaping the next generation of fashion, making sure that Paris will forever remain at the forefront of innovation.
In the past few years, especially after COVID-19, technology has transformed the way many experience Paris Fashion Week. Live-streamed shows, virtual reality experiences, and social media have democratized access, allowing millions to view this event while it’s occurring. Social media platforms have become integral to the event, with influencers and brands using them to amplify their audience reach.
But despite its long legacy and renown, Paris Fashion Week is not a stranger to challenges. From rising calls for sustainability to accessibility, there are many areas where progress is being made. The rise of digital fashion — virtual garments and NFTs — poses both a challenge and an opportunity. Paris Fashion Week has begun to explore these frontiers, as well as others, in an effort to remain relevant even during changing times.
Considering Paris Fashion Week’s history, it’s clear how important it has become in the fashion world. It’s not just that it’s a legacy event; it’s an event that sets standards for fashion everywhere in the world. It’s a cultural phenomenon that dictates how we perceive and engage with fashion, even on a daily basis. The colors, styles, and fits that are all the rage today were on the runways at some point in time, showing just how influential this event is.

Fifty kilometers northwest of Paris the green fields roll gently in the early morning dew.
I glance at the sun rising over the horizon through the lozenge window of my tiny, black Renault Twingo, and feel around the passenger seat for my sunglasses, eyes on the road.
The windshield clouds and I have to keep raising the defrost and turn on the wipers — it’s that early in the morning in July. Mist drifts in the hollows.
I’m all alone on the road, but for a singular vehicle in a highway lane on the opposite direction speeding across my line of vision, and the always present trucks that appear as if born from the topography.
In open green fields, stucco and tile farmhouses interrupt the eye, draw it in and I wonder about the length of time these places have been here, memories buried deep in the stone. You feel the age of the land, its harmony — but you know great disharmony got them here, to this moment.
I feel as if I’ve been here before. I haven’t — but it feels that way, a kind of in-between reality, a memory I didn’t know I had and the newness of the place pressing up against one another.
What is the place of memory in a story, any story? What is the place of memory in a life? What constitutes memory?

It was an evening like any other. My uncle Simplice gathered my brother, my two cousins and me around the fire that he often had us light after dark in the courtyard of his house. It was in August, during the school vacation period. I was about 8 or 9 years old, my cousin Vieux was the same age, while my little brother and my other cousin Papi were 5 or 6 years old. We had finished dinner and, as was often the case in many villages in Cameroon, the boys were invited to join the men to listen to tales full of wisdom and stories about the history of our ancestors, while the girls often stayed with the women. This separation, which was in no way reflective of the social hierarchy, dated back centuries. It was through these evenings that the wise men passed on their knowledge. Africa, for centuries, was a continent giving priority to oral culture, hence the importance of a griot, a word used for an older African tribal storyteller.
That evening, my uncle Simplice had shed his relaxed side that made him our favorite uncle. We all loved his dilettante side which made him one of the fiercest hunters in the village. He knew how to put you at ease when you had your baptism of fire in the initiation to hunting in the forest at night. That evening, we all looked at each other, as his serious and almost solemn appearance was so disconcerting. We weren’t used to seeing him like this. He opened the session as he often did with his singular cry.
 “Audience,” he urged. “Silence,” we responded in unison.
The custom was for this ritual to be performed three times. It concluded with “Do tell.” Only after that could the wise man start the story. That evening would not be like any other, my uncle warned us.
 “We are going to talk about the history of all Cameroonians, regardless of their tribe. It’s a common history that binds us,” said my uncle, who spoke in a Bantu dialect.
He had married my mother’s older sister and his village, Ekali II, was located about thirty kilometers from Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
My uncle, who was a teacher at the local high school, then spoke to us about colonization. The story was devoid of moral teachings, which often flooded the stories he had told us in the past. He used the word “white” to refer to the colonists. He explained to us that, for a long time, our ancestors had lived with the idea that white people were immortal. This was what the settlers had propagated, he said.
 “They said that their God had made them immortal. They had guns to kill us, while we had nothing. We ended up believing them. Guns were believed to be divine weapons to punish anyone who dared to rebel against them.”
 “And how did you discover that they were mortal?” I dared to ask.
 “At the end of the First World War,” he replied. “What happened was that some of our brave men were taken to Europe to fight in the war alongside white men. They saw them die. They then said to themselves that the white man could also die. The survivors came to tell what they had seen. Little by little, the way we looked at white people changed, but we had to wait until the end of the Second World War for the myth of the white immortal colonist man to finally evaporate.”
This awakening, which dates to the end of the 1940s, coincides with the exacerbated aspirations for independence in the colonies. One of the very first colonies to become an independent country was Ghana in 1957, followed by Guinea in 1958. The rest had to wait until the 1960s. Until today, we even speak of neocolonialism in certain countries, because the former colonial powers continue to pull the strings behind the scenes to put in power the president of their choice and to exploit the continent’s resources with the help of corrupt local elites.
For more than 30 years, I buried deep inside me the words from my uncle about the immortal colonist, as this image had horrible consequences for millions of Africans and for Africa in general, because it was a weapon to subjugate and enslave us. I preferred to look forward. But the past and its images caught up with me a few days ago during the exhibition “The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism,” currently on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
The Harlem Renaissance is undoubtedly the artistic expression of the chronicling of the modern daily life of black Americans by black Americans in the midst of the Great Migration, which corresponds to the period from the 1920s to the 1940s. During this period, many black Americans were leaving the rural, racist and segregated South for the North. The exhibition, which is a dive into the New Negro artistic movement, introduces us to painters, artists and intellectuals both known and unknown. Among these artists is the painter Archibald Motley, who lived, for a short period of time in Paris and in the south of France. In the text which accompanies Motley’s paintings, created during his French period, it is recounted that many Harlem Renaissance artists often stayed in Europe and more particularly in France, which was one of the European artistic centers of the time. This European passage was seen as “an essential part of their artistic training.”
The text also raises one of the biggest dichotomies between black Americans and black Africans. This sticking point is at the center of the discord that has fueled our disagreement for decades: “The artists associated with the New Negro movement also described feeling a sense of greater personal freedom in countries that, despite oppressive rule in overseas colonies, did not have legalized racial segregation within their own borders,” one of the texts reads.
This sentence suggests that the United States was, at the time, more racist than Europe, and particularly France. This is still repeated today by black Americans who visit Europe or live in France, let alone Paris. For them, France, like certain European countries, is less racist. This is entirely contrary to the daily experience of black Africans and other minorities, particularly Arabs, living in Europe.
I understand well that this sentence aims to summarize the experience of black Americans in France and beyond in Europe, where they were better received and, above all, seen as full human beings, whereas in their own country, they were perceived as subhuman.
Racial segregation was legalized and took the form of the Jim Crow laws which separated blacks from whites in transportation, housing, employment, education, bathrooms, hospitals, churches, prisons, funeral homes, cemeteries, etc. This “inferiorization” of black Americans was legitimized and made official by a decision of the Supreme Court in 1896. The famous decision of May 18, 1896 on Plessy v. Ferguson ruled that the State of Louisiana was entitled to classify Mr. Plessy among the “people of color” because of his one-eighth black blood and that Judge Ferguson could consequently prohibit him from accessing the wagons reserved for whites!
There was certainly no law rendering blacks and other minorities inferior in Europe, but in fact (and this is the European particularity) the racial hierarchy was omnipresent and still is today in a very subtle way. In the 1920s to 1940s, to which the Harlem Renaissance exhibition is focused, almost no country in sub-Saharan Africa was independent. Very few blacks lived in Europe and in France. France did and continues to do everything to hide the horrors of colonization. Just a small example that took place during the Harlem Renaissance period was the Thiaroye massacre, which took place in Senegal in December 1944.
In November 1944, France was being gradually liberated from the Nazi occupiers. After four years of war, 1,300 West African riflemen (Tirailleurs as they are often referred to) were repatriated by the French army to Thiaroye, in a military camp in the suburbs of Dakar. They were demanding payment of their captivity balances, as well as various bonuses which had not been paid to them. At dawn on December 1, gunfire broke out in the camp. The French army said it was a mutiny that it had to repress bloodily. However, many gray areas remain.
For several years, the official French position was that the “Thiaroye affair” was a “heavily armed rebellion and a hostage-taking” requiring a “response” with disastrous results. But in November 2014, the French President François Hollande on a visit to this Dakar suburb, said that France must “repair an injustice and salute the memory of men who wore the French uniform and on whom the French had returned their rifle.”
The Thiaroye massacre, according to historians, was the consequence of France’s decision to “whitewash” its troops by replacing riflemen from Senegal, Dahomey (present-day Benin), French Sudan (present-day Mali), Côte d’Ivoire, Oubangui-Chari (present-day Central Africa), Niger, Chad, Gabon and Togo, by ethnic French soldiers.
The Harlem Renaissance exhibition also celebrates artists like Joséphine Baker who became a superstar in France. The success of one black individual in no way erases the treatment received by many others. At the same time as Paris celebrated Baker, the remains of Saatje Baartman, a South African slave whose body had been dissected and cast, her brain, her genitals and her posterior preserved in formalin, were exhibited at the Musee de l’Homme in the same city of light.
Born in South Africa in 1789, Baartman was exhibited as a human monster in Europe, notably in London and Paris. She was the first modern freak. She had been nicknamed the “Hottentot Venus” for her atypical physique. The name already constitutes a testimony to the way Europeans viewed black Africans. Venus refers to the Greek goddess of beauty, but was used here to mock her body which Europeans found disproportionate due to its exuberant forms which visitors fiddled with like an animal. “Hottentot” refers to her origin (she was from the Khoikhoi or Hottentot tribe).
The famous French zoologist Georges Cuvier, who was responsible for dissecting her body after her death in Paris in 1815, had concluded that she belonged to the same species as the white race, but that did not prevent him from classifying her at the very bottom of the human scale, barely above the chimpanzee and the orangutan. A place that the Hottentots shared with the Bushmen, the Pygmies, the “Caribbeans” and the Australian Aborigines.
What is striking in Motley’s paintings in Paris, is that the bars and cafés are full of white people, an indication of the place of black people in French society. That hasn’t changed much today. We are considered second-class French citizens. Racial discrimination is subtle but pervasive. Renting an apartment in a large French city is a challenge when you are black African or Arab; finding work that matches your level of education and abilities is also a challenge. No minority is running a large French company. Young minority graduates are forced to go into exile to find work that matches their level of education and skills.
How many blacks and Arabs live in Paris? The presence of black Africans and Arabs in tourist places and neighborhoods is an illusion. They don’t live there. For a long time, part of the 18th arrondissement of Paris, towards Barbès-Château Rouge, was the landmark and meeting point for black Africans. Black Africans could buy products imported from Africa there. While the market remains and black Africans are still present, almost none live there because of gentrification.
Before declaring Paris and France as less racist, black Americans would benefit from taking a quick trip to the suburbs around Paris, where minorities are segregated. Seine Saint Denis, which is one train stop from Paris, would give you an example of the true living conditions of blacks and Arabs in France. Basically, ten minutes by train, getting off at Stade de France, will allow you to really see France in its true light. When you are a black African or Arab, police checks are part of your daily life, as are racist clichés.
The latest controversy in France: French pop star Aya Nakamura, who is of Malian origin but grew up in the Paris suburbs, doesn’t really speak French to sing at the opening ceremony of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, say the right and the far-right. A rumor spread that the singer, currently the best known outside French borders, would sing in the ceremony. She immediately received numerous racist insults, simply because she mixes dialects, from foreign languages, with French in her music.
 “You can be racist but not deaf,” Nakamura responded on Twitter on March 10. “What do I really owe you?”
73% of French people think that Nakamura does not represent “French” music, according to a poll, while 63% oppose the idea of her headlining at the opening ceremony. This says a lot about the state of racism in France.
For black Africans, north Africans (Algerians, Tunisians, Moroccans) and other minorities, racism is our reality in France and Paris. Black Americans are seen as American visitors. White France’s relationship with them is different from what it is with us. It goes back to General Charles de Gaulle, the French hero of the Second World War, who always wanted to distinguish France from the United States, by offering an alternative to the American model in the world stage. Seen from this angle, welcoming black Americans who are ostracized in their country is a form of affront to the American rival. Except that, in reality, France does not treat its blacks and minorities very differently.
I asked some of my black American friends why they had this impression that France was less racist.
 “The only thing that comes to mind is that many [African Americans] are just unfamiliar with French history,” my black American friend Bruce replied.

There were a few places I went during my holiday in Paris. Practically they were not museums, but the visiting experience was worth being noted.
The free entry was included in my Go Paris card, and I was intrigued by the description mentioning the final days of Marie-Antoinette, so I stepped into the old prison. I didn’t have really high hopes as I saw some photos online, and I wasn’t impressed. However, one small thing was a real game changer.
The Histopad!
I am not too keen on incorporating technology in museums as part of the tour. It doesn’t sound sensible and I know how I sound: Not everyone can “appreciate” or “learn” with traditional method, which is purely visual observation. Technology like AR (augmented reality) VR (virtual reality) to me are distractions, and I feel like they sometimes lack the profoundness, i.e. content, and therefore they are more like tokens or trophies.
However, if I hadn’t toured the Concierge with the Histopad, I would have left with great disappointment. There were pods around the place where people scanned them with the pads, which initiate the augmented reality of what could the place look like in the 15th century. The animation was made fine and it really provided a lot more information on the historical context, such as the people who dined, walked, how they dressed, etc.. What I liked the most was the hidden treasure that visitor could collect if they really aimed to click every possible button in the AR. I managed to find 5 out of 6, failing to find the last one. I was a bit bummed because I was very curious to learn what prize I could have!
2. Musée Parfum — Fragonard
I visited this place because as part of my Go Paris card deal, there was a mini workshop provided by the Fragonard Perfume Museum where tourists could make their own perfume. A few months prior to the visit, I finished reading the book, : Elixir: A Story of Perfume, Science and the Search for the Secret of Life, by Theresa Levitt. The name Fragonard was mentioned multiple times, as he was an important figure not only in the perfumery business, but also in the history of chemistry.
www.amazon.co.uk
Unfortunately I didn’t take any picture during the quick guided tour after the workshop. It was basically a brief look at the history of the Fragonard brand, including the classic best-seller smell and the design of the bottles.
I had a great impression on the visiting experience: It was hands-on, multi-sensory (the whole museum and shop smelled amazing), and the environment was beautifully designed. What I want to highlight is that this is another type of museum — Corporate/Brand museum.
dotdotdot-it.medium.com
I once joked with friends that there should be a law or policy that regulates what places could call themselves “museums”, which is a term frequently used by private collectors, hoarders, and people with niche interests. I’m not putting the term museum on a high altar; instead, I want museums to follow standards so audience could have an appropriate expectation when they step into a place that is labelled “museum”. Standards should include: If the collections on display are sourced ethically; if the display is from one single private collector; and if the place is funded by a publicly-known corporate and brand.
If a museum is about the history and archival perspective of a corporate, it is highly possible used as a white-washing front, distracting or misguiding the public from truth and creating a parallel narrative. A museum should be a place where voices of different backgrounds are curated to reflect the public and the community, and if any exhibition or institution fails to do so, they should not be called a museum but a display.
3. Paris Catacombs
I wasn’t aware of the catacombs until an advertisement popped up on my social media feeds. A walk among the deads’ bones? Yes! Within a heartbeat I booked myself a visit to it.
It was a well oriented and executed place with many signs of direction. The audio guide provided painted a great picture of the history and how the catacomb was conserved in modern times. For some, the environment definitely was spooky, but I was really happy to learn how the dead was treated in history.
!! Attention!!
Pictures of human remains. Readers’ discretion is advised.
A minor thing worth noting is that there would be staff checking visitors’ bags to prevent people smuggling the bones and skulls.

My time in Paris during the Olympics was filled with the odd, the ironic, and the sublime.
I had my first bad meal in Paris, and it briefly crushed my spirit. Like many people, I have long romanticized this city whose history and magic are etched in literature and film. “There are only two places in the world where we can live happy: at home and in Paris,” Ernest Hemingway said.
Dozens of famous quotes profess such homage, none more succinct than Maurice Chevalier’s character in the 1958 film Gigi asking incredulously, “Leave Paris?” Audrey Hepburn got to the point: “Paris is always a good idea.” Victor Hugo put it more eloquently in his 19th-century novel Les Misérables: “To breathe Paris preserves the soul.”
This is the beguiling image travelers bring when they visit Paris, and the city generally delivers. Fashion windows are more inviting than in New York or London. The storefronts dare you not to linger. Stunning centuries-old architecture fills the frame in every direction. Surely that is part of what Hugo breathed in.
Even the city’s graveyards boast elegance with a literary flair. Père Lachaise Cemetery is the final resting place of poets and artists from Chopin to the famously troubled Doors frontman Jim Morrison, whose tomb bears Greek words that approximate “the one who fights his demons.”

Perhaps the most potent problem of our modern era is its obsession with nostalgia. In its least malignant form, nostalgia becomes an excessive love of art and fashion playfully removed from the socio-political conditions of its creation. In its most malignant form, nostalgia turns people into cult-like fascists who desire a return to a time that never really existed. Most nostalgia travelers rest somewhere between: fantasizing about going back to something that felt more familiar, even at the expense of the present. And then there’s Midnight in Paris (2011), which seems to relish in misery, imagination, and nostalgia at varying points and for varying purposes. What ultimately does the film say about nostalgia, then?
Midnight in Paris follows Gil (Owen Wilson), a Hollywood script doctor disgruntled by the artlessness of his work, who visits Paris with his fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents, all wealthy socialites. Utterly in love with the city and its Modernist past, Gil fantasizes about moving there to make an honest go at becoming a novelist, much to the chagrin of Inez, who cannot fathom a life outside of the United States. They eventually run into the horrifically pedantic Paul (Michael Sheen) and his wife Carol (Nina Arianda) and are coaxed on several sightseeing trips. In frustration, Gil wanders Paris…

The Seine’s Starring Role in the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,https://medium.com/@convenemagazine/the-seines-starring-role-in-the-paris-2024-olympic-games-e488bc6d21b3?responsesOpen=true&sortBy=REVERSE_CHRON,"Sign up

Author: Barbara Palmer
One of the ways that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) plans to meet its goal of hosting the most sustainable Olympics in history is through a policy of using what is already there — 95 percent of Olympic venues will be existing or temporary structures, said IOC’s Marie Sallois.
One of the most spectacular venues is one that has been there since the birth of the city — the Seine, which flows through the French capital and is considered by many to be the most romantic river in the world. And next year — following a massive $1.5-billion clean-up — for the first time in more than a century, swimmers will race in the river in the Olympic Summer Games.
Swimming races were held in the Seine in 1900 when Paris first hosted the Olympic Summer Games. But by the time the city hosted the Olympic Summer Games for the second time in 1924, swimming in the Seine had been officially banned because of high levels of water pollution. The current clean-up is one of many undertaken in the last 30 years, but is the biggest and most ambitious, accelerated by the river’s starring role in Paris 2024, which includes the Opening Ceremony. For the first time in the history of the Olympic Summer Games, the Opening Ceremony will not take place in a stadium — spectators can watch from the banks of the Seine as a flotilla of boats carrying athletes from around the world passes landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame in a nearly 4-mile-long procession.
Making the Seine swimmable in time for Paris 2024 has the city of Paris racing the clock, connecting thousands of households and houseboats to the city’s sewer system and constructing mammoth catchment basins for stormwater, among other improvements. Three open-water swimming events scheduled to take place in the river were relocated last summer, after heavy rain overwhelmed the sewage system. But other test events “were very successful,” Sallois said.
Ridding the historic river of dangerous levels of pollution will leave an ecological legacy that goes far beyond Paris 2024, according to Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, who proposed swimming in the Seine as part of the city’s Olympic bid. Due to clean-up efforts, the number of fish species in the Seine already has increased from two to 30, Hidalgo told CNN. And in 2025, the city plans to open the river to public swimming, which will not only restore a beloved tradition for Parisians — “my mother swam in the Seine,” Sallois told Convene — but give residents a way to cool off during increasingly sweltering summers. Paris recorded the highest temperature in its history — 108 degrees Fahrenheit — in 2019.
Swimming in the Seine “happened in the past,” Sallois said, “and it will happen again.”

Sweet and sour stories about expat and immigrant life.

Yesterday I phoned one of my dear friends. She is French, but she moved to Madrid 3 years ago.
We talked about our lives, about how she does not have the time to fully learn Spanish, and how difficult it is to make local friends without speaking the language.
It made me think about my « débuts » in France.
I came to Paris when I was 19 years old to study law. I thought I would stay a year or two to change from Austria, but here I am, 17 years later.
Today, I would like to share my story about being an adult expat, the difficulties I faced and how to overcome them.
I grew up with the idealized image of Paris, which we see in the movies and cartoons — the city of lights and love, with happy people full of wonders and artists.
I am half embarrassed to say that even at the age of 19, I almost thought things in Paris were the way they were shown in the cartoon Anastasia: happy people dancing around the city on the pavements and going up the Eiffel Tower to scream their joy of being French.
Let me burst your bubble right now, and I am sorry for that: Paris might be the city of arts, lights, and love, but it is definitely not full of joyful people. Quite the opposite, to be honest.
It is a wonderful place to visit, and it is one of the most beautiful cities I have seen so far. Starting to live here, though, was a challenge, and still is sometimes.
French people are known for loving good food, good wine, and… complaining. It is not a legend, a true French will always find something to be unhappy about: politics, weather, wages, the food, the wine, the prices, the subway, the trains, the airplanes… You name it. If you watch the international news, you might know France is also the country of strikes.
Let me summarize the French art of striking: for the last 77 years (even more, but we lack archives), the national railway company called SNCF has been striking, mostly every summer and Christmas holiday every year. Yes, you read it the right way. Every year. For the last 77 years.
I must admit I find this art of being constantly unhappy quite charming, at least sometimes. Unless it impacts my daily life, which will then become the moment when I hate living in France. I suppose after 17 years, I became a bit French myself and adopted the unhappy philosophy!
Now, let us imagine you are an expat in France; you try to adapt. Is it hard? Yes and no. At least in Paris, the capital, people are used to foreigners, so they will not be shocked. But that does not mean they will accept you with open arms right away.
The first difficulty you would encounter is the language. French is not the easiest language to learn, and to grasp the French accent is quite difficult. Of course, you could just learn to speak it without trying to imitate the French accent. You could even become bilingual in French over the years, like I did; but do you think that would be enough?
After 17 years, I still get jokes and comments on my accent, although I am bilingual. I studied law at the Sorbonne, and I practiced as a lawyer for several years, so you can imagine I even know very technical terms an average French would not know. Without the perfect accent, all that does not count.
To my despair, it is the only country I know of where you make an effort to speak the language, and people will criticize your efforts instead of being happy.
While many appreciate your efforts, others will comment on your accent or correct your grammar — perhaps because they love their language so much they can’t resist pushing you toward perfection.
Finding true friends is challenging, too, as in every country. It was easier when I was a student, of course, but I learned that there is no age to find new friends. It is always possible. The secret?
Do something you love — join a class, an association, or a group related to your passion. You’ll find that French people are much more welcoming when you share common interests, even if you’re not fluent in French.
It seems contradictory, I know, but the thing is, a French will not make too much effort for a complete stranger, but if you want to join a group, things change. Just pick your passion and go for it!
Now that we have mentioned the less-than-happy parts of living here let’s get to the interesting part: Why come to France?
First of all, food and wine. It might sound cliché, but living here, or even visiting for a couple of days, opens new perspectives and changes your way of visualizing eating. For French people, food is sacred, so even the lunch breaks are quite long compared to other countries. Eating a sandwich in front of your computer is not the norm here.
People love enjoying the food, and it’s contagious. Before you know it, you will eat with your eyes before eating with your mouth. You will start enjoying every bite. You will start looking for new ideas for your cooking. You will start enjoying eating and tasting different foods. And thus, you will start enjoying life itself.
As for the wine, you will not find a better country to learn about it, taste it, and want to become an expert.
Living in Paris will also open your cultural chakras. Many artists and writers have found inspiration in this city. I could walk for hours around Paris without even noticing it; every street is worth the while. So many different cultural and fashion events take place in Paris, we never get bored.
My favorite neighborhood is the 5th arrondissement*. Hemingway used to live there, on the Rue Mouffetard, which is also my favorite street in Paris (and one of the oldest, too). You can find Gallo-Roman ruins, beautiful old churches, the Pantheon, and many other things in this arrondissement. It is also a student hideout because of its proximity to the Sorbonne.
If you ever visit the city, do not miss it!
It is always beneficial to try to understand the local culture. If you can get help doing so, it would be even better. I never thought I would change my career path the way I am planning to, but here I am today, hesitating to propose coaching services to expats who come to France.
It took me years to really start grasping the complexity of French culture and… bureaucracy. It also took a Master’s in law to better understand how to navigate the administrative system. From opening the first bank account to finding a school or nanny for the kids, it is quite the journey for an expat. It is also difficult to find people speaking enough English to really help you.
I will always preach the benefits of having help when moving to a new country because I suffered a lot of isolation and lack of proper communication during my different expat experiences.
To finish, here is a list of important things to know, even as a tourist. The « dos » and « don’ts » are quite a few, so I will write another article about the topic.
In the meantime, keep in mind:
Adapting to life in Paris was challenging at first, but the city has a magic that always draws you in — even when times are tough. Over the years, Paris has taught me to slow down, savor the moment, and enjoy life. And I’m still learning every day.
Please let me know in the comments if you have visited Paris or planning to do so. I would love to hear about your experience!
* arrondissement is the translation of « districts »

I spent two years in Paris after I graduated from college. Those years were some of the most important, eye-opening, formative years of my life. I fell in love with a city. I fell in love with a people. I fell in love with a way of life that I wish everyone could experience.
So you can imagine my surprise when I occasionally run into Americans who tell me that they have visited Paris and, “It just didn’t do it for them.”
Poppycock!
If Paris “didn’t do it for you,” then you’re either too stuck in your own way to enjoy a culture that runs so contrary to your own, or… you simply didn’t do it right.
That city is a treasure. It lives up to all the hype of how it is portrayed in pop culture, and I promise it will steal your heart if only you’d let it.
If you haven’t been to Paris and you’re thinking about taking a trip, the best thing you can do is not listen to the people who found it underwhelming because, as I’ve already mentioned, they don’t know what they’re talking about.
The other thing you can not do is look on Yelp or similar sites for the most popular things to do in Paris, because, again, I can promise you that the most popular activities by tourists’ standards are not the best activities by the city’s standards.
Instead, listen to me, an ex coffee-drinking, bonjour-saying, cigarette-smoking, jazz-listening Parisian (yeah, I’m the real deal) who can show you the way to get the absolute most out of your trip.
For the first year that I spent in Paris, I took the metro everywhere, which certainly has its benefits, especially if you’re interested in the Parisian quotidian (daily life).
The second year, I bought myself an old road bike and used that as my daily commuter. And that, my friends, was the single most important lifestyle change I could have made.
Paris is a city full of hidden gems that you will not see from an underground metro or through the window of a speeding cab. Its architecture and bustling life that stretches from cafe to cafe should not be missed.
Riding a bike around the city is a great way to stumble upon little neighborhoods and scenes that you ordinarily never would have come across. Instead of wasting the time in between destinations watching a drunk homeless man curse on the metro, you are getting a more complete view of the city.
Paris also has a bike culture unlike anything we have in The United States except for maybe in New York. Many of the citizens commute to work in full professional attire by bike, and because of that, the city is quite cyclist-friendly with things like protected bike lanes lining every road.
So, if you’re comfortable on a bike, go rent one and see the city as it should be seen. It’s cheaper than the metro or an Uber and it’s a fantastic way to help digest those extra croissants that you will undoubtedly be eating.
Of all the must-see tourist sites in Paris, the Montmartre neighborhood is by far the most efficient, romantic, and Parisian.
If you feel the need to go see the Eiffel Tower up close or walk along the Champs-Elysee, then, by all means, go right ahead. But I promise that those places are populated exclusively by other tourists and hucksters whose profession is ripping off those very tourists.
Montmartre is also full of tourists, but it’s got a latent “Frenchness” about it that you won't find standing under the Eiffel Tower. It’s the neighborhood where the famous painters of old spent their days mastering their crafts. Romantic sentiments of that time still linger in those streets. One half expects to find Manet with a pipe, easel, and glass of absinthe musing over a dusk glow that is perhaps too complicated to capture in oil.
The narrow, cobblestone streets and fantastic little restaurants are nostalgia-fueled, giving you the feeling that you are walking around sometime in the early 20th century. It’s magical.
The bonus is that if you can make it up to the top of the hill to see Sacre Coeur Basilica, you’ll be privy to the best view in the city (granted it’s a clear day).
I’ve always said that when you go to Paris you shouldn’t try and see the sites, but instead you should try and see the neighborhoods. Sacre-Coeur is great but the Montmartre neighborhood is what will really steal your heart.
Place de Bastille is great, but Le Marais is what will really, really steal your heart. This neighborhood is probably my favorite in the city. It is huge, full of unbelievable restaurants and cafes, art galleries, and probably the best shopping in France.
Parisians tend to stay away from areas that are saturated with tourists, but Le Marais is an exception. Yes, there are hordes of foreigners walking around asking for directions, but there are also plenty of citizens who go there for lunch, to drink, or just to buy clothes and hang out in a park.
If you can find a way to get lodging in Le Marais, your trip will already have a huge leg-up. If I were visiting Paris today, I would probably spend the better part of a day (or maybe two) exploring Le Marias.
Go find the renowned falafel restaurants, stumble upon a trio playing gypsy jazz music, or just sit in a cafe and watch the characters walk by.
I think everyone visiting Paris should walk by the Louvre because, from the outside, it is as magnificent as anything else you will see. The Tuileries Gardens that lie just outside are also an exceptional use of your time.
On the inside, it’s a different story. It is one of the biggest museums in the world and virtually impossible to see in one day. Many of its hundreds of rooms are full of historical artifacts among which you will almost certainly get lost.
Hot take: the Mona Lisa is wildly underwhelming. Yeah, I said it.
So if you’re planning on doing a massive museum excursion in Paris I think your time would be much better spent at Musee D’Orsay. Situated just down the bank from Notre Dame, Musee D’Orsay is home to a much more palatable collection of paintings.
Being a fan of impressionism and its closely related movements, I found D’Orsay to be far more impressive than The Louvre. It’s also quite a bit smaller which allows you to actually consume the whole thing at once and without getting lost (the layout is logical and easy).
Also, to be honest, I like D’Orsay because it doesn’t have miles of historical artifacts that are undoubtedly exciting but serve to just get in the way when I really just want to look at art.
Other museums I prefer over The Louvre are the Centre Pompidou and the Musée Picasso.
You’d waste your trip if you didn’t stop at one of Paris’s many gorgeous parks, the best of which is Buttes-Chaumont.
When you walk into Buttes Chaumont you will quickly forget that you are in the middle of a large, urban city. Trees, swans, a pond, and a jutting cliff with a gazebo are all features of the park that make it unique and beautiful and that is why it is my pick for the best park in Paris.
No city loves a good picnic more than Paris. It is common to find young and old alike sprawled about on blankets drinking wine and eating baguettes with cheese against the backdrop of this sloping, tree-covered park. I encourage you to do the same.
Another neighborhood in which you will want to spend a considerable amount of time is the Latin Quarter/St. Germain. This wonderfully French neighborhood sits just on the south side of the Seine river and is chock-full of things to do.
The Latin Quarter was to writers what Montmartre was to painters. It’s got an implicit feeling that great art was (and maybe still is) created here.
This is another area that doesn’t necessarily have one thing to see (aside from Notre Dame, of course), but instead is something that you will just want to take in. Park your bikes and just stroll along the maze of narrow roads that lead to scenes of street jazz waiting to be discovered.
Also found in this area is The Jardin de Luxembourg, Shakespeare and Co. bookstore, and a handful of fantastic arthouse movie theatres for all the cinephiles.
There is not a doubt in my mind that you will eat good food while you are in Paris; it’s impossible not to do so.
Yet I would encourage you to save at least one meal for a style of restaurant known as a Bouillon.
These restaurants are traditionally French in every aspect: they serve classic French cuisine, the staff is outfitted in the typically French white shirt and black tie, and the tables are all close together so you get that real up-close and personal feeling that the French love.
My favorite bouillon is Bouillon de Pigalle (in the same neighborhood as Moulin Rouge), but you can find them scattered all over the city.
This is where you will find a menu dedicated to escargot, traditional style entrecote (steak), and a wine list that reaches the floor. Nothing will make you feel more French than spending an afternoon in a bouillon.
If there’s one thing that Paris takes seriously, it’s the consumption of alcohol. So it’s no surprise that amongst the variety of fun bars to choose from, Paris is also home to an array of speakeasies scattered about the city.
For those of you who don’t know, a speakeasy is a drinking parlor that was used during prohibition to covertly consume alcohol free from the scrutiny of the law. Nowadays, these parlors of old have become popular, trendy watering holes for cocktail aficionados and nostalgic drinkers (like myself).
My favorite of the Parisian speakeasies is a place called Lavomatic which masquerades as a laundromat. Customers are allowed entry by a security guard who doesn’t immediately give the location of the entrance, leading first-timers to explore the laundromat for hidden buttons and doors.
Once inside, you are surrounded by a small, dimly lit lounge with swings for seats and low ceilings. The atmosphere is romantic and the cocktails are innovative and delicious. Oh, and they get you drunk.
Other speakeasies to try out are The Little Red Door and The Moonshiner, which is hidden somewhere in the back of a popular pizza restaurant.
My final piece of advice for seeing Paris is to try and be French.
Americans are always complaining about how rude the French are and how they hate tourists from the United States invading their capital city.
The truth is, and I can tell you this for sure, most Parisians don’t hate Americans but they certainly do not appreciate when Americans come to France and bulldoze their culture.
So trying to be French doesn't mean mocking their culture but instead accepting it. Here’s a shortlist of some of the ways you can start becoming French.
Not only are little things like this much appreciated by the citizens, but they should also be the cornerstone of a good vacation. In order for one to gain the most from exploring another culture, one should be ready and willing to leave their own culture at the door and really soak everything in properly. I think if more Americans traveled with these considerations in mind, we might be well on our way to shaking the negative stigmatization of “The American Tourist.”
Paris is one of the most magnificent cities on the planet and it breaks my heart every time someone tells me they visited and didn’t really enjoy themselves. It has so much to offer if you’re looking in the right place, and it is my sincere hope that the suggestions given above can help as many people as possible enjoy the full Parisian experience, and thus expand their worldview.

“…Is to know a great deal.” ~ Henry Miller (controversial author)
Paris is a place of lore. After years of listening to people I love and respect talk endlessly about Paris, we had arrived. Albeit, only for a long weekend. It wasn’t enough time.
It’s not only clients or friends. Paris has been revered throughout history as an artist’s haven.
“An artist has no home in Europe except in Paris.” ~ Friedrich Nietzsche
A divine place of historical significance, beauty and culture.
“A walk about Paris will provide lessons in history, beauty, and in the point of Life.” ~ Thomas Jefferson
And of course, surrealism and the années folles or the golden twenties. The birth of pop culture. The modern development of fashion and style. A melting pot of American influence, tremendous economic growth, film, theatre, and athletics.
Many of my favourite writers and artists have lived in Paris at some point in their career.
“Paris was always worth it and you received return for whatever you brought to it.” ~ Ernest Hemingway
For the novice traveller, Paris comes with quite the résumé.
Dare I say it is the the most over-hyped city I’ve ever travelled to. My feelings are more mixed than history’s. Possibly due to over-saturation and cost of living. Which is saying a lot coming from Vancouver (another high cost of living city). Then again, it could be because I don’t have any Parisian friends to show me around.
It’s the 3rd most visited city in the world, but the average dollar amount spent by tourists is double the top two cities (Bangkok/London). $301/day USD compared to $153–173.
It’s extremely expensive, and shockingly packed with tourist destinations.
You can’t walk more than a few hundred meters without tripping over the next museum or historical landmark. Seriously I can throw a rock from the Louvre to Saint Chapelle.
We saw the outside of pretty much everything on day one. Then we were left wishing we had planned some skip the line excursions. Getting ready to leave and Oktoberfest were so busy we forgot to plan things that weren’t accommodation. Even in October, it was crowded with tourists!
Yes, I understand the irony of that statement, being that I’m a tourist. No matter how I may like to pretend I’m not, or try to experience places as locals do. I remain an ignorant tourist.
I can only wonder how @#%@ing crazy Paris is in the summertime.
Paris, has a population of ~2.3 million. The majority of the city is composed of five story walk-ups. Making it the most densely populated metropolis in a developed country and it’s geographically tiny!
Vancouver is tiny, at only 115 km². We build towers exceeding thirty stories and have a population of only 600k. San Francisco, another tiny city, is 121 km² and 800k people. I’m amazed by the density of Paris without the need for many tall buildings.
Paris is a mere 105 km² with triple or quadruple the people. That means it’s chaotic. Very walkable, with an somewhat outdated and packed metro system. At least it covers a great deal of the city and they post hilarious signs in it.
And my personal Fav…
Are misunderstood. I had full on expectations of being forced to stumble through my poor French. While the person I’m attempting to communicate with snickers behind my back about it.
You hear stories. Few of them true.
The service doesn’t suck, it’s just not Americanized. It’s supposed to be felt and not seen. They are not coming to check on you every 5 minutes. They are not coming by to crack jokes and entertain you for tips. They want you to enjoy your meal or coffee or whatever. When you’re done, ask for the cheque s’il vous plaît and you’re off.
I kind of like it. I’m not fond of being waited on.
People are not rude. But you should keep an eye on your stuff and your wallet when travelling on packed transit. As you should in any major city.
People are fashionable. I should have brought a scarf. A concern Jenny and I both have about travelling to Europe, is only obvious in Paris so far. Not that I’m fashionable to begin with. I have for the better part of twelve years worked in shorts, a sweat-wicking shirt and maybe a track suit of sorts.
There is a pervasive feeling in any country about the largest city. Canadians outside of Toronto like to hate on it. The French outside of Paris also seem to hate on Paris. I get the feeling Parisians are in love with their city.
There is an air of smugness. I feel the same way about Vancouver. The French tend to think that Parisians never shut up about Paris when they leave it. Everything is better in Paris! I don’t feel this way about Toronto but I know some who do.
I’m choked I missed the Catacombs. Things were so crazy before we left and at Oktoberfest we forgot to book any tours.
The only non-negotiable thing for me was the Louvre. I’ve had a fascination with Leonardo Da Vinci since I was a kid and seeing the Mona Lisa was a top priority.
It’s true that no matter where you stand in the room, it feels like she’s staring just at you. A special technique Da Vinci used. Of course the world’s most famous painting is so famous due to the mystery surrounding it.
There are many other famous works in the Louvre like Venus De Milo, Winged Victory, The Coronation of Napoleon, Dying Slave and Liberty Leading Leading the People. Michelangelo. Delacroix. Who cares? I’m all about Da Vinci right now. 😜
We crushed a few kilometers of walking every day. I thoroughly enjoyed taking it all in. You could have a great weekend without going into a single tourist venue.
We stayed near the Eiffel tower. Had a bottle of wine on the grass during one of the hourly light shows. Roamed through a beautiful market. Rolled down Champs-Élysées past the Arc de Triomphe and the Louvre.
I know French food is amazing but we cooked in our tiny AirBnB more often than not. Who can resist French cheese and charcuterie?
After a costly Oktoberfest, we’re attempting to be a little more budget conscious here. It seems more likely we’ll be back to Paris than Munich anyway.
I’m just going to say it. If you like red wine, it’s the best in France. End of story. I’m convinced they don’t ship any of the good stuff to Canada.
Oh and don’t forget about the street art and a surprising coincidence. An Alphonse Mucha exhibit was on when we were there! One of the few pieces of art we own is a print of Zodiac. I’m a much bigger Mucha fan leaving Paris.
That’s our world-wind tour of Paris. It isn’t my favourite city yet but I can see the charm and appeal. We’ll be back for the catacombs.
It was the weekend so neither of us worked which was nice, Bordeaux will be different. Back to work...🤘

So you’ve landed in Paris with your family and your cats. What now?
It turns out that when you land in another country halfway around the world where you’ve never lived and don’t speak the language, things can be a little confusing. We were especially ill-prepared, not having been to Paris before for more than a few days at a time and neither of us speaking more than a couple of words of French. When we landed, we had the address of our rental apartment and a few bags and that was about it. We’ve learned a few things since then that may be useful to anyone following in our footsteps.
Here is a survivor’s guide to the first 30 days on the ground in Paris.
If you’re from the United States, it’s likely this is going to be the most confusing thing for you when you land and try to get a life together here. There are two major differences between bank accounts in Europe and in America — the “chip and pin” card and the RIB.
Let’s start with the “chip and pin” card. You know that credit or debit card that you have in your wallet? Well, it’s useless in about 20% of the places you’re going to try to spend money here. In another 30%, while it will technically work, it’s extremely confusing to the people trying to take it. You see, in Europe, they have “smart card” credit and debit cards. They have a little smart chip in them (a little goldish squarish technical looking chip on the left side of the card) and a pin code.
Everywhere you go, instead of swiping your card, you stick the card into a reader and type in your pin. Restaurants never physically take your card away, they bring a reader to your table and you insert your card, type in the pin and take the card back out. I don’t think I’ve had a single French person touch any of my credit cards once since landing here. The way Americans handle credit cards is comically insecure to the entire European continent.
I had a fun issue with this almost immediately after getting here. We landed in Paris on Monday morning. On Thursday evening, just a few days after touching down, I attended a meetup that GitHub was sponsoring by buying pizza, soda and beer. A few hours before starting, the organizer let me know that I would have to personally pay for the food on site. Normally this isn’t how it works, normally they would pay for it and GitHub would reimburse them, but these details weren’t worked out beforehand.
I knew this was potentially going to be a problem, because I’ve been to Europe before and I know about the chip cards and besides that I only had an Amex corporate card which not everyone takes. I figured I would probably have to put this on a personal card at best. Well, it turned out that they delivered €993.14 worth of food and low and behold, they only take chip cards. So I had to embarrassingly find someone there who could float $1300 personally and PayPal them the money. This was also done almost entirely in French. Good times.
This is just the worst situation I’ve encountered. Tons of places simply won’t take non-chip cards. The most frustrating is the Metro system — if you don’t have a chip card or cash, no trains or public transportation for you.
The next major difference between the US and French banking systems is the RIB. “RIB” stands for Relevé d’Identité Bancaire and is one of a few bank account numbers that are needed for bank transfers (basically a wire). For ongoing monthly payments, credit cards seem to be almost never used here. Instead, you give people your RIB sheet (like a weird little bank form that you print from your bank website) and they do bank transfers every month with these numbers.
It’s actually sort of an awesome system because you can look up individual people you’re paying this way and shut them down individually if you want to stop paying. With a credit card you would have to cancel the card in a scorched-earth sort of move to stop someone from charging who didn’t want to.
It’s important because there are a lot of important things that you cannot pay for without this form, which you cannot get without a French bank account. Some things we ran into fairly quickly were rent for the apartment, real SIM cards, co-working space rent, and gym memberships. Our utility costs happen to be either included or passed onto us by the landlord, otherwise I assume those would require a RIB too.
So, for the love of God, start getting a bank account the second you hit dry land. I tried getting an account before we got here, but essentially got nowhere with it. Everyone told me to just come in when I arrived in France.
About a week after landing, I finally got it together to email a bank. I contacted Crédit Agricole d’Ile-de-France through an English version online form on their website. I can highly recommend them. They contacted me back almost immediately after filling out the form (June 18th, while I was still in the US) and I got back to them 2.5 months later (Sep 1st, after we moved in) and they immediately helped me through everything.
You will have to bring:
Passport
A utility bill from your home address less than 3 months old (electricity, water)
Proof of income (payslip or Tax statement)
Your last 2 months bank statements from your main account
Now, since we just moved in and didn’t have a utility bill in our name, we instead had to bring in a utility bill in our landlord’s name, plus a copy of their passport and a letter saying we live at their address. Luckily our landlord had done this before and got us all the documents we needed within a few days. The other documents we already had copies of from our visa application process months earlier.
The guy that helped us, Kristopher, was a super English gentleman and could not have been kinder or more helpful. We had to go in person to their office which was over in the 12th district, but it wasn’t too bad. The process took about 45 minutes in a private office with Kristopher and we had the RIB that day and I went to pick up the chip cards from the same office a few days later. Then we went to a local branch, took out about $400 from our Chase account and deposited it into our new CA account to get it going.
My only real advice here would be to do this something like the day after you land rather than a week or two later. Actually, it’s best to do whenever you can get the residency documents from your landlord — maybe even let them know you’ll need these before you arrive so you could get this done on the first day.
Finally, I should cover how to get money into your account. You can certainly wire funds, which costs about $20 per wire I believe. Unfortunately for us, we hit a bit of a race condition here. We had already switched our phones to French pre-paid SIM cards (more on that in a bit), but we couldn’t add a wire recipient without SMS confirmation. I suppose we could have called them, but I really hate talking on the phone to banks so I sort of avoided it. It’s on my list of things to do.
What I’ve been doing in the meantime is using PayPal. I set up a new PayPal account linked to my French account and I send money from the American account to the French account and then deposit it. It doesn’t seem like a horrible exchange rate and if you fund it via the linked bank accounts the fees aren’t bad at all. It takes a few days, but it works. Also, be warned that if you try to send more than €2,500 you will get flagged and need to upload pictures of your passport and whatnot to PayPal so they know you’re not laundering money. I’ve actually hit a lot of really annoying things lately due to people wanting to make sure I’m not laundering money.
If you’re smarter than I am and still have your old SIM and can add your new French account as a wire recipient on your US bank account, I’ve been directed by my European friends to a site called TransferWise. They apparently have great rates for international bank transfers like this. One of my next goals is to get this working for me so I don’t have to keep doing this PayPal hack.
We’re going to be here for a while, so we definitely needed local phone plans. Not having data on your phone while trying to navigate around and find places gets frustrating really quickly. Using your American phone account to do so get expensive really quickly.
One of the very first things we did the day after we landed was walk over to an Orange shop and buy prepaid SIM cards. For those of you who are American and have no idea what a SIM card is, it’s a tiny little card that goes into the side of your phone that changes it’s carrier and phone number. Most Americans never change these but it’s fairly common in Europe to have a few of them and swap them out when you visit other countries — like have a German SIM and a UK SIM, etc.
You can pay about €5 for the card and €30 to fill it with a plan that lasts a few weeks and gives you 1Gb of data during that time. It takes a few minutes of waiting in line (I think it’s illegal to not wait for at least 20 minutes after entering a mobile phone shop here), but then you leave with a working phone. Many Americans may also not know if their phone is unlocked, meaning the phone allows you to change the SIM out at all. Most iPhones sold in the last few years have come unlocked, but you can also call your carrier and ask them to do so for you.
That lasted us for a week or two, though you need to be careful what you do with it. If you accidentally make an international call you can exhaust the credit really quickly and then you lose your data too. After a really long time I finally figured out how to recharge it. You can go to recharge.fr, click on the Orange carrier, choose the €5 or €10 plan, pay with PayPal and then text the confirmation number they give you (a 14 digit number) to 21224.
Jessica’s phone kept draining super quickly for some reason that we couldn’t figure out. For a while I had to recharge it almost every day, it was super annoying. My HTC One M8 only had to be recharged every week or so.
Eventually we wanted to get real SIM cards with plans. For one, the prepaid cards don’t let you connect to 4G, so the data is slower than it could be. For another, you don’t have a card on file with them so you can’t recharge very easily. It’s also almost impossible to figure out why you’re running out of credit. There are packages for €40/mo that give you 7Gb of data per month and 4G access. The catch is you need a RIB and proof of residency. Once we had our bank account, we went back into the Orange store and signed up for a year contract to get the better SIMs. Remember to make copies of the residency documents you took to the bank, because you’ll need them again here.
When you get here, it’s going to be tempting to Amazon things that you need to yourself, but the issue is that there are very few apartments where they can drop stuff off for you. Unless you’re home all the time, they’ll show up to your place and then drop off the package at a point relais or “relay point”. This could be a grocery store or a pharmacy or a laundromat. If you’re lucky, this will be a point that’s close to home. We ordered a couple of household items that we couldn’t find around town our first week and had 4 packages delivered to 4 different places, some of them a mile away. Not only do you have to go get them, but then you have to haul them back to your place. If you order something heavy, it’s up to you to walk it back to your place.
Also nobody that handles these relay points speaks English because why would a non-Frenchman be sending packages to themselves via relay points? This is not a super-touristy thing to do. The first one I did was pretty painful, I had no idea how to say why I was there and I didn’t have a drop slip with me that they usually leave in your mailbox. The important word here is “colis”, which is what they call this type of package. Just mutter something like “j’ai un colis ici” and hand them the slip and your passport and they can generally figure it out. If you don’t hand them your passport the first thing they’ll ask you is a phrase containing the word “identification” (say that in your head in a French accent) — this is a good word to learn how to listen for because it comes up a lot and it’s easy to continue making them think you know what they’re saying by handing them your passport.
I found out later that Amazon.fr will let you specifically chose a relay point when you check out. This ends up being a way better idea because you can choose one much closer to your place and you can get to know the process there a little better. You can also log into Amazon.fr (which is a totally separate site) with your normal Amazon.com account and pay for things in USD instead of taking the currency conversion hit, which is also nice. This can be really helpful for getting things together in the first few weeks.
The metro in Paris is fantastic. If you’re living in San Francisco, it’s almost hilarious how much better public transportation in Paris is compared to the city with the world’s worst public transportation system outside of LA.
The trains go everywhere, it’s simple and cheap to get tickets and the trains come basically every 2 minutes. I think the longest I’ve waited for a train in the month I’ve been here is probably 6 minutes and I’ve taken them pretty much every day. There are at least 4 major metro stops within a few blocks of our house.
We donated our car to KQED when we left San Francisco, and it’s been pretty amazing to have not needed a car at all in over a month. If we do need a car, Uber is also operating in San Francisco, and the accounts we already used still work fine. You can launch the app and get a car within a few minutes. Not only that, but since you can now put a destination in it helps with the language barrier in trying to inform your driver of where you’re going if they only speak French.
If you are in Paris for any amount of time over a week, you should definitely get a Navigo card. This is another thing that took me a bit of time to figure out. Paris has a RFID card that you can load up with credit and use to get onto the metro without having to buy tickets. You can load it up with either a week or a month, I believe. It’s actually a little confusing when you first get here because they have these recharge stations that don’t dispense tickets but can only recharge these Navigo cards, but they don’t dispense the Navigo cards themselves. In Tokyo, for example, you can get a card like this from a machine in the subway station (good ol’ Pasmo), but here you cannot.
To get a real Navigo card, you have to be a resident. However, I think fairly recently, they added a Découverte card, which you can just buy as a visitor. I believe you can get these at the manned booths at the train station, but those guys always seem a little pissed, so instead I went to a tobacco shop. You can find these shops every few blocks around Paris. They usually have a “tabac” sign and an RATP sign that’s fairly easy to identify. If you see one, just duck in and say anything resembling the word “Navigo” and they’ll know what you mean. I think it costs €5 for the card and you can normally charge it there with either one week or one month of use. I got cards for all three of us and it’s way easier than buying a hundred of the little one-way tickets. If you’re in Paris for even a week and are going to be using the Metro a lot, pick up one of these cards.
They also have this weird thing in Paris where any membership cards you get they want you to put your picture on. They don’t do it themselves, they give you a card with a sticky area on it and expect you to go to a photo booth, print out a picture and affix it yourself. The Navigo cards are like this and a year membership to the science museums we got for Jo was like this too. They have these booths in a number of the Metro stations and they also have one at the FNAC, the sort of Best Buy of Paris.
It’s important to understand that there isn’t really a thing here like American breakfast. It’s called “petit déjeuner” but it’s really just like a coffee and a croissant.
Just learn to not expect eggs and bacon and pancakes first thing in the morning because it’s almost certainly not going to happen unless you go to a toursity place that has “American” breakfast.
Basically the most important thing to learn here is to say “café crème” (kuh-fay khremm) which is basically a small latte. They are delicious and sitting at a table on the street watching people go by slowly sipping a latte is something that simply doesn’t get old.
That’s all of the weird “getting set up” logistical stuff I can think of that we went through that might save you some grief if you ever do something like this too.
Having been here for a month now, it’s incredibly satisfying to feel a little more like a native by whipping out my chip card to pay for groceries or Navigo to walk through the subway turnsiles with Josie. Even just walking around with visitors and using my data plan or being able to give out a local number to people I meet here so they can text me is really nice.
We’re really starting to feel at home, even in daily life.

Some cities you simply visit, while others visit you. Paris is one of the latter. It doesn’t just stay in your memory; it returns through people, through unexpected messages years later. As if it still cares.
— Grandma, Paris is so beautiful!
I’ve been there several times, and each time it felt as if the city was waking up from a dream just for me. The Seine’s embankment was bathed in bright sunlight, boats gliding across the water, and the streets filled with women showcasing that elusive French chic — something indescribable that makes their outfits unforgettable.
I sang La Marseillaise in a taxi, much to the bewilderment of the driver, and my cheerful mood helped me meet new people.
One day, not knowing French, I walked into a café and decided to greet the waitress with a phrase from Moulin Rouge:
— Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?
She first looked surprised, then narrowed her eyes and smirked, as if evaluating whether I was naive or just bold. Only later did I learn that this meant, “Would you like to sleep with me tonight?” What a way to start a conversation!
By the way, my coffee arrived unusually fast.
I met a girl on the plane. She was kind, talkative, and suggested we meet up in the city. We sat on the terrace of a café near our hotel, drinking beer at a leisurely pace. She told me about her divorce, her family, and I just listened, smoked, and enjoyed the moment.
There are moments when the right place, the right person, and the right drink come together to create pure bliss. That’s Paris.
The next day, we both got food poisoning from oysters at a restaurant. After that, she distanced herself a bit, but we still keep in touch.
Sometimes I wonder — if not for those oysters, would we have met again? Or did Paris give us exactly what we needed and nothing more?
The Louvre was packed with people. Leonardo da Vinci’s works were breathtaking in their original form, but my heart was captivated by Murillo’s paintings. His beggar boy picking lice from his hair — wasn’t just a painting, it was a whole life captured on canvas.
In Versailles, I befriended an IT guy. He was shy, stuttered a bit, but I introduced him to two beauty-industry girls who radiated pure fun. During our tour of Versailles, we drank champagne at the back of the bus. The IT guy loosened up, and later, we all posed among the gardens, mimicking classical statues.
Turns out, life is beautiful when you’re surrounded by warm, tactile, and kind people.
Parisian skies are a work of art on their own. Impressionist painters knew how to capture their shifting tones, and their works fill the former train station — now the Musée d’Orsay.
Though I still find Gauguin’s escapades in Tahiti unsettling, I can’t deny the raw brilliance of his paintings from that period. They hold a special place in my heart. There’s something about them, wouldn’t you agree?
I met two sisters — one of them was a model, tall, slender, playful. We laughed a lot, I invited them to the museum, and later, we took pictures in front of the elephant statue.
I was small, she was like a fairy from a storybook, and her sister stood in between us. Paris creates strange yet unforgettable moments.
We drank beer right in front of the Arc de Triomphe, and then the younger sister let me take hundreds of photos of her in a gray coat with her blonde hair cascading down. When she lay on her back on the Pont Alexandre III, I realized that happiness is just a feeling of the moment.
The Loire Valley is a world of its own. Medieval halls, enormous vases overflowing with flowers, and the stories of marquises who lived extravagantly. That’s where I met a little girl traveling with her grandmother. She dashed through castle corridors, demanding that I take pictures of her in the most unexpected places — on rooftops, beside water lilies, even standing on her head.
On the bus, she insisted on sitting next to me, looked at me with her dreamy eyes, and said:
— Let’s sleep!
She was seven. It was both funny and surreal.
I wonder — if I met her ten years later, would I recognize her?
Paris allows you more freedom than other cities. You can sit in a café late into the night, talking.
— And sit as long as you want, thank God! — says a Notre Dame gargoyle.
At one café, an old man joined our table. He had worked with Tarkovsky, but now he was a hotel porter. His stories about cinema were mesmerizing, though we suspected he had once played for “the other team.”
At some point, he invited us to a nightclub. We went.
The music was strange — acid techno! One French guy from our group drank too much and was supposed to stay at our hotel because he missed his train. At first, we were happy for him, then we were worried — he disappeared.
I hope he just got on another train and now tells his friends about the eccentric group of travelers he met that night.
Paris is always fun, unpredictable, and exciting. It’s best not to plan anything ahead, because new people and places will always find you.
Some cities leave a mark on you.
Ten years later, the little girl from the bus found me.
— I’ve been looking for you, and I found you! How have you been?
I smiled. I guess she wants me to remind her of the phrase she said to me on the bus. No doubt about it.
Paris never says goodbye.
Paris always gives you a sequel.
Every moment spent with Ni unveils new dimensions of grace and mystery. Dive deeper into her world in:

Paris is commonly used in music lyrics. Why is such a popular subject? What does Paris mean in these lyrics? How do people perceive Paris?
The Chainsmokers define it as
“1: A sentimental yearning for a reality that isn’t genuine.
2: An irrecoverable condition for fantasy that evokes nostalgia or day dreams.”
Paris gives a sense of fantasy that people don’t have in their mundane life.
“We were staying in ParisTo get away from your parents”
— The Chainsmokers
It’s a place to runaway. It’s a place where you don’t have worry about all the problems.
“But how I’d love to go to Paris again” — The 1975
It’s a romantic and satisfying place that people want to go but never got to go.”
“You and me in ParisFree to be who we arePrisoners of desire”
— Karen Souza
It’s a place of freedom.
“We don’t need a fancy townOr bottles that we can’t pronounce’Cause anywhere babeIs like Paris in the rainWhen I’m with you”
— Lauv
Anywhere can be Paris if you are with the right person. This indicates that Paris is a romantic place filled with love. I have to agree that Paris in the rain is memorable. There aren’t many people with umbrelllas.
“I got Paris Blue hung over my shoulder” — Frequent Flyer
It’s a place that can bring sad and happiness at the sametime.
“April in ParisThis is the feelingNo one can ever reprise”
— Ella Fizgerald
Lyrics just say so much but it seems like it’s necessary to go now. It’s a place that cannot be reprised.
“We’re so Paris when we kissed, when we kissed” — One Direction
It’s more than a place now. It’s a description of how romantic people can be.
“Why oh why do I love Paris Because my love is here
She’s there, she’s everywhereBut she’s really here”
— Frank Sinatra
It’s back to the definitions of all of the above. It’s a fantasy place. This is my favorite song among all songs about Paris.
What’s so great about Paris? I had the same question until I saw the Tour Eiffel blinking at me at 11PM. (It felt like it was winking at me.) Walking around the streets at night with the wind blowing through your hair makes you forget about everything. Seeing Giuseppe Acrimboldo’s Four Seasons at the Lourve, you find out how paitings can communicate to you. Drinking a cup of espresso on the sidewalk makes you love coffee more than ever. Looking at all those famous people buried in Cimetière du Père-Lachaise makes you realize how at the end we are all at the same destination. As people said in thousands descriptions, “You need to see it to know what I mean.”
It’s a place that seems unreal and ideal.
Paris is the best representation of fantasies.
I’d like to live in the Paris for awhile.

It’s been a few days since I landed in Paris. I tried to write the first night, but I got about a paragraph and a half completed and had to stop because I was tired. Here’s what I wrote:
“It’s 7:28 pm in Paris and it’s been an interesting first day. The flight landed at around 1 pm and I partially slept on the flight. Enough that I didn’t feel that bad and that’s a pretty good way to start.”
Just a few minutes later, we went out on our first exploration of the area to walk along the canal St. Martin and happened to come across a restaurant we ate at last summer, Le Verre Volé. It was excellent and then we popped into a neighborhood wine shop and tried two glasses of wine that were excellent and with varietals I’ve never heard of before. It was a wonderful first day.
Our second day in Paris started out by sleeping in. I didn’t sleep well that first night and was up at 3 am not able to sleep. Then, we slept in and didn’t get out until 3 pm. The next day consisted of running some errands: eating at a now favorite boulangerie, Du Pain et des idées, (Considered one of the best in town), getting a new French phone number, going to the Alliance Française to check out the process of the placement test, then walking through the most beautiful garden on the planet, Le Jardin du Luxumbourg, and then deciding to head over to the Louvre, because it’s open until 10 pm on Wednesdays and we wanted to see if we could purchase our yearly pass, Les Amis Du Louvre. We were able to purchase our passes and decided to see just one thing…. Marcelo gave me the choice and because he mentioned Napolean III’s chambers, which I had never seen, we went there. I think the Louve is best experienced in small doses because it’s so so big and there’s so much to see. I was actually considering blogging about going to every room in the Louvre over the next year, since it’s something that I really want to see and experience.
After walking through Napolean’s palace chambers, we found a high rated wine bar with charcuterie in the Marais which was on the way back to our airbnb that looked good. We meandered there walking through areas we’d never seen and just as we came upon the Pompidou, we turned left and had an incredible platter of rillette, two types of fromage (cheese), and jamon iberico and another type of ham. SO good.
We literally walked outside after it was over, to see a bustlingly busy bar, or street, rather, since half the patrons were outside smoking, and thought, “Oh, this looks like a cool bar!” and started walking in only to find my one friend in Paris, there with a group of his other friends. This is a feeling I haven’t had in a long time. Walking around a place and randomly running into someone I knew. Capitol Hill in Seattle used to be like this for me.
Today, Day 3, we woke up and I had a coffee down the street at a Portuguese cafe with real Pastel de Nata (which were excellent), then we met our official translator of our Marriage Certificate to pick up our French translation to later include in my equivalent of a green card application. Then we get more pastries from aforementioned new favorite pastry shop and I went to the Alliance Francaise to register and take my placement test. We spent the evening at home, eating incredible organic cheese from the “Biologique” market a block away and drinking a ridiculously good cider for 3€.
Now that I’ve had some more time to think and process, I’ve come up with some things that have surprised me, awed me with their beauty, stunned me with their simplicity, and with their cost.
Easier than Expected
There were some potential hurdles that I was worried about that turned out not to be hurdles: checkin for the flight in Seattle, immigration and customs in France, and getting a phone. I was worried that a one-way ticket would sound off the alarms and that we would be detained by immigration. We even printed out the EU regulations in English and in French just in case a customs officer didn’t want to let me in the country. But, alas, they were not needed. I checked into my flight and went through immigration and customs very quickly.
Getting a phone number was also much easier than I anticipated. My husband is an Italian citizen, so he just showed his passport, and they started signing us up for our new phones. Oh, and it was also a lot less expensive than we expected. We got a phone number for 9€ each and then a monthly payment of 30€ which has unlimited calling in France and free roaming in Europe. We got prepaid phones for the first few months so that after we get our apartment, we can switch over to a package that includes internet.
I have been reading a book on Culture Shock in France and read that one shouldn’t smile too much and that Americans smile and French people find it unsettling. The woman who helped us with our phones was very kind and chatty and smiled a lot.
Misconceptions about the French
Everyone (aside from one, which I’ll talk about later), has been incredibly kind and helpful. We’ve had good service, helpful, smiling people in shops, and very patient people willing to help us out. Honestly, I’ve had an extremely positive experience here in France every time I’ve been here and running into one person having a bad day doesn’t mean that every French person is rude.
Ok, the one rude person was the checker at the nearby supermarket. I waited in line for my turn and when it was my turn, I put the shopping back on the counter so he could check my items. Apparently, I was supposed to take them out of the basket, because in a huff, he dumped the basket over, toppling out all the items and then glared at me. I didn’t laugh, but I thought about how it must be a stressful time of day since the line was long and he was the only person there. Eh. Whatever. I know now to take them out when I see him. I tested out this theory getting some groceries tonight and the woman at the other market was super nice and just stared checking the items out of the basket before I could take them out. Ok, it was just that guy.
The French don’t speak English. Wrong. We literally have to continue speaking in French to people once they realize we aren’t native speakers or we are a little slow. Marcelo is MUCH better than I am at French (speaking both Portuguese and Italian, the roots of the words are very similar) and he told me this would happen. Just keep speaking in French, even if they respond in English. I’ve been tripped up a few times, but most of the time, I can follow what’s going on, even if I can’t say exactly what I want to say. So yeah, everyone has been incredibly helpful and speaks English pretty well.
Some fun cultural differences
You bag your own groceries and you always pay extra if you need a bag. Everyone carries around reusable bags to use for groceries. I still need to get one of those (I know I have one at home, but sadly, didn’t bring any with me).
Get used to waiting longer than you think. Another fun cultural difference was having at the wine and charcuterie last night. When we got to the wine bar, the one guy who was working said we could sit wherever we wanted and that he’d be right there to check on us. He gave us menus, and off we went. There were two tables available (and we had a reservation, so it was nice that we had a choice). One was cramped in between other tables and the other had more room around it, but it had dirty plates from the previous guests. We sat at the nicer table with more room, but with the dirty dishes. Surely, he’ll be by soon to pick them up…
…
After about 10–15 min, we are questioning what was going on. We look over and realize he is the only person there and that he is preparing all the food for everyone. Ok, makes sense. It’s a small place, but he’s busy. We discuss whether it’s culturally appropriate to give him the dirty plates. We could smell some of the paté from the previous plate and well, we kinda wanted to not smell it. Marcelo thought that would be considered rude (I think generally American Type A-ness is considered rude in France), so we opted to move them to the other, sill vacant table. Marcelo took them over and then came back a mix of shocked and horrified and said that everyone in the restaurant turned to look at what he was doing. Apparently, you’re not supposed to bus a dirty table, or move them to another table.
Around 25 min after we arrived, we still hadn’t ordered. The waiter came by to say, “Just a minute,” and “We ran out of bread so I have to go get some next door.” And then ran out of the restaurant, had a smoke break while he was chatting up the cute girl up front, then came back several minutes later to cut the bread and brought it out to the other tables.
Then, he took our order. We didn’t know how the menu worked, so we had to ask a few questions and he then had to bring another menu and we waited again for him to come back… after we ordered, he put together the plate and well, the photo says it all. It was shockingly good. The rillette alone was amazing, the wine was perfect, we both had a different favorite cheese and there was a moment half way through the meal that I realized that the Jamon Iberico was most likely literally from Spain. It was excellent. And my Spanish friends out there will be proud to know that the Jamon truly represented Spain well. Love.
Nothing goes to waste. Oh yeah, I forgot the other thing about the bread. After the other table left, he picked up their bread basket and put it on our table, next to the fresh basket of bread that he brought us. Marcelo pointed out, “You’d never see that happen in the US!” True that. Nope, but I didn’t mind. I’m glad it wasn’t thrown out. It would have totally been a huge waste because the bread was so good. I think Marcelo said it best when he said, “This meal couldn’t be eaten without bread.”
Eggs are kept outside the fridge. Really? Yeah, really. We looked this up last week because I didn’t believe Marcelo when he said Europeans don’t refrigerate their eggs. We found this short video that explains why. But yes, it’s true:
Wine is crazy inexpensive… and excellent. It was hard to find bottles over 8€ in the store. Tonight, we had a crazy inexpensive cider for 3€. We splurged to get a Morgon, (A particularly amazing Beaujolais) for about a quarter of what it would be in Seattle.
I have so much more to write about and so much more to say, but I’ll leave it here for now. For those following my instagram, you’ve seen more, and I promise some of that will make it into this blog too. Some of it won’t. Like how we happened to come across a game store, only to find it’s solely a Warhammer store. They kindly invited us to do a quick demo of the game and miniture painting and also directed us to another nearby board game store that sells the games we’re used to. I didn’t take a photo, but I was impressed. Games were similarly priced, or less expensive, than in the US. I seriously thought everything would be expensive, but no, life is not only much better here, it’s also less expensive.

What you have to do to prepare to move from San Francisco to Paris in three months.
So, you’ve decided to move from the United States to Paris, France.
Perhaps like myself you made this decision more or less on a whim with no real planning going into it before the decision was made, or perhaps you took a longer, more reasonable approach to the problem. Either way, you now have a series of things to do before you board that airplane.
Now, I should preface this by saying that I’m not a lawyer and I’m not a travel agency. I did find it useful, however, when I was planning my move to read through the notes of other people who had done roughly the same thing. There are only a handful of them on the internet (here are some) and if you’re seriously considering doing this, read them all in addition to this. Your mileage is certain to vary.
What is amazing about this process is that most of it is dictated by government agencies, and yet nearly every step of the process is insanely vague. Therefore, I feel that sharing what we experienced could be hugely helpful to someone else trying to accomplish the same thing. Reading through the consulate docs are one thing, hearing the story of what real people went through is a bit different. Again, this is not a how-to, this is a how-we-did-done.
Well, first things first, getting a French visa. In order to live in France for longer than the normal 3 months a tourist visa gets you, one has to get a long stay visa of some kind. There are several different types of long stay visas you can get, though most are super specific — being a student or an au pair, or marrying a French person. The one that seemed to fit us best was the “D” visa or long stay “visitor” visa. This is actually a little confusing to everyone involved, because I’m going to be working from home essentially, but not for a French company and not doing business in France.
The “D” visa essentially asks you to prove that you can live in France without ever being in danger of getting a job at a French company. I believe it’s normally for people who sort of want to long-vacation in France or semi-retire there, but working for a strange company that lets you work from anywhere fortunately and also occasionally frustratingly blurs the lines. Countries don’t really know what to do with people like me. However, this is the best option I could find that fit me.
Now then, there are 14 steps to the visa application process.
Most of these were actually fairly simple. Some pictures at the Kinkos, fill out the visa form, get your passports, birth certificates and marriage certificate together, etc.
There were, however, some difficulties. Many of which may have been easier had this blog post existed for me.
The first was the “Letter promising not to engage in any employment”. I have no idea what this means. What’s even more confusing about it is that the next thing you need is a “Letter of employment”. This is one of those many instances where language is really quite vague. What I ended up taking this to mean, and which I basically had to specifically verify with the Visa Officer at the French Consulate, is that they mean “We need a letter saying you won’t get a job at a French company, depriving a Frenchman of a job, so prove to us that you have your financial shit together”.
Figuring out what that letter was supposed to say in order to get it signed and notarized was also a little frustrating. There are no templates or anything. We ended up just writing:
“I, <your name here>, promise not to engage in any employment in France.”
And then signing it. And then notarizing it. And then getting weird looks from the Notary Public because why the hell would you notarize that? We got it notarized at the Post and Parcel in Potrero on 18th St. They were super nice and patient with us, I highly recommend them.
The letter of employment was sort of weird, since I’m a cofounder and board member at my company so I was unsure who I was supposed to get to sign it. “Dear France, I work for me. Love, Scott”.
I assume, however, that most people don’t have that issue. They ended up not accepting it anyhow because it didn’t state that the company planned to continue to employ me once I was in France, which is what the consulate was looking for. If you do this, be sure to get that in the letter, in addition to your salary and title. In my case, the proof of means of income was enough that they didn’t much care about the employment letter — basically as long as they don’t think you’ll try to get a job for a French company or that a Frenchman could get, it doesn’t seem to concern them that much.
Proof of medical insurance was a pain for me, but mostly because it’s fairly rare for a US worker to move overseas and need to transition to expat insurance. Most of this was handled by our insurance broker eventually, but coming up with our medical history and whatnot took up most of a day. I ended up going into the consulate with emails saying I was going to get expat insurance and that I had travel insurance currently and they ended up being fine with that. I should do another blog post at some point about how ridiculous the American health care system is and how insane it is that we don’t really own our own medical records, but that’s for another time.
Proof of accommodation and the e-ticket were interesting requirements because they both require you to expend a rather grand amount of money to apply for a visa that in theory you may not be granted. I’ve heard on other blogs that you can get hotel accommodations and a refundable ticket to hedge your bets, but we actually rented a furnished apartment through Lodgis and bought our one way tickets before applying for the visa. Needless to say, I’m pretty glad we ended up actually getting it.
While we’re on that subject, here’s a quick tip. If you move to Europe for a year, buy round-trip tickets. Technically you can’t get a return ticket a year out, so I’m not saying figure out when to come back. I’m saying burn the return ticket.
I didn’t even think about it and one-way tickets were about $2200 each on United so I ended up getting us tickets on Canada Air with a stop in Toronto for about $800 per ticket through some super-shady seeming Kayak referral company. I was fairly certain we were going to get to the airport and the flight wasn’t going to exist.
However, if I had selected a round-trip flight with pretty much any return date, I could have gotten non-stop flights to Paris through United for like $1100 per ticket. Basically adding the extra 15 hour flight home saves you half of your ticket price, contrary to all rational possible logic.
For the love of God, buy round-trip tickets.
We also had to get Josie a new passport since we got her one when she was only a few months old and they only last five years. The passport you have when you apply has to be valid a few months past the end of your stay. Since Jo was almost five when we applied, the passport would have expired during our stay in France.
Getting a new one for her was pretty interesting. We had to do it in person since she’s a minor and appointments were all months away so we had to use the first-come line at the Post Office on Sutter.
There is basically a single place you can get same day passport appointments in San Francisco and it’s pretty much a total shit show. The office opens at 8:30a and by 8:32a there are 15 people in line for a single person working the Passport counter and each applicant takes at least 10 minutes. If you’re there the second the office opens you still have a 45 minute wait. The first time we showed up, I forgot a document too, so we had to do it a second time. Make sure you have everything before you go. Or plan this far enough ahead of time that you don’t need to go into a no-appointment passport office.
So we made the visa appointment about a month and a half in advance and set to work doing all of that, which was pretty easily do-able within that time. Other than the health insurance issue, which ended up being fine, we had no other real problems with any of the requirements.
The visa appointment itself almost could not have been easier. For one, we lived in San Francisco, so we could easily go there in person without having to travel or anything. I had also heard that it could be difficult or confrontative, but everyone we met was really patient and nice to us. Some consulates ask for a “statement of purpose” I’ve heard, but the San Francisco one did not and honestly I think the French are generally like “Of course you want to live in France, France is awesome!”
The only problem that we had was that we physically had our documents in the wrong order. They want them all in exactly the order listed, per person. We had something like “one for me, one for her, next for me, next for her”, etc. They wanted everything for me in order, then everything for her in order. We had to stand there and reorder everything and I don’t think the consulate officer was super happy with us about that. So, make a note if you’re doing this with your family.
Also, minors don’t need visas. Obviously we would have had to get her a new passport anyhow, but we didn’t need to pay the application fee or get her photos or anything. They ended up processing it for her and surprisingly actually issued her a visa (which the officer said they normally don’t do for minors), but it wasn’t necessary. It turns out if the parents get visas, they let their children come with them.
The next step was to find a school for Josephine. This was actually one of the first things we started looking for, but it took us a while to choose, apply for and finalize. It was also pretty stressful looking for a school when you can’t really visit any of them, communicate or search very well in French.
I first started emailing schools in early May, before we had really decided to move. Getting Jo into a school that we felt comfortable with was a prerequisite to moving at all.
It was actually a pretty interesting juggling act, because we wanted to find an apartment, a school for Josie and a language school for Jessica and have them all be relatively close or commute-able. We decided to start with Jo’s school and we narrowed it down to six schools that have at least some English instruction (we had heard that it can be very stressful for English-speaking children in fully French schools as they’re basically special needs children and we’re not citizens — it gets confusing).
A lot of the choices came from an article on EasyExpat.com and a few other searches. We basically ended up deciding based on the fact that only two of the six schools got back to my email at all and one of them was very responsive and easy to communicate with. Perhaps not the greatest way to choose a school, but possibly not the worst way either and it seems to be working out well for her. They do French about half the time and English the other half.
If you are considering moving to Paris and have a child, the following school was personally recommended to us by a local as a great bilingual school for kids who speak English: L’École active bilingue Jeannine-Manuel in the 15th arrondissement. They also recommended École Alsacienne in the 6th, which is on the EasyExpat.com list, while Jeannine-Manuel is not.
We ended up finding an apartment that took cats (whom we decided to try to take with us, more on that later), had an extra room for me to work in and was furnished. It is also nicely close to a Metro line that goes almost directly to Jo’s school. Finally, it was only a short walk to a great language school that Jess decided to enroll in. Everything’s comin’ up Millhouse!
So now that we have a place and schools and plane tickets and visas, we’re really moving! Now the problem is what to take with us. Since the apartment is furnished and it’s going to have to be difficult to ship stuff to France, we decided to basically try to store almost everything. Like, everything we’ve accumulated through 12 years of marriage and 5 years of having a child. However, there were some children's books, technology and clothes and things that would certainly be more than we could check and didn’t really want to re-buy, so we decided to try to ship a couple of boxes.
So now the question is, how do you get a few boxes of stuff shipped to France? Turns out that it’s not actually very easy.
I found out that there is an International Flat Rate 25kg (about 50 lbs) box that you can, in theory, ship to France relatively easily. So we picked up four of them and packed them full and just stored everything else in our lives. This is sort of an interesting philosophical game within your family — what can you live without? At about $300 per box, it’s a really compelling question.
Well, I thought we could just show up to the FedEx with these boxes and pay the flat rate and boom. Nope. Turns out that the boxes are going through customs so you have to declare everything in the box on a form. Literally everything. If you have 5 pairs of shoes you have to list them one item at a time and put how much they’re worth and where they were made and where you got them. For each pair of shoes. I had fucking USB cables and shit in there.
This was incredibly frustrating because we had tons of stuff in these boxes. How much is a jacket you got 3 years ago at Marshall’s worth? I got super frustrated and came damn close to just walking out of the FedEx in a huff when Jessica stepped in and just went through all their hoops. Because she’s a better person than me. So anyhow, if you want to ship something this way, figure out what’s in each box exactly and be prepared for literally hours worth of paperwork at the FedEx office.
We are not smart people. We’ve adopted three FIV-positive rescue cats during our marriage, two of whom are still with us. Technically they’re feral rescues, but only one of them acts like it.
So one of the earliest conversations was what to do with the cats. Do we give them up? Do we see if we can get a family member to watch them? Do we take them with us?
This was actually a pretty difficult conversation because there is no way anyone would ever want these cats. They’re both super sweet, but they’re also FIV-positive which means they have occasional (or in the case of the one, constant) health problems. Problems which can sometimes be expensive. We are literally the only humans on the planet that would continue to keep these cats alive.
What made things a little easier is that it turns out, contrary to what we had both believed, domestic cats don’t have to go through a quarantine process. It’s actually somewhat simple to move to another country with them, process-wise.
You have to get sky kennels that meet the USDA and IATA requirements for shipping live animals. We initially got ones that were way too small for international travel and had to buy new ones. You have to get a vet that is licensed by the USDA to check the animals and they have to be chipped with an international chip and get a rabies vaccine booster. Then within a week of leaving you have to make an appointment to go to the USDA/APHIS office and present all of the forms that your vet gave you.
We went to the APHIS office at 389 Oyster Point Blvd, Suite 2 in San Francisco (really far south, by the airport). The USDA person there was super nice and everything went pretty smoothly. Our vet at the Mission Pet Hospital in San Francisco was able to put all the documentation together for us, including the French forms.
You can find most of this online, but in several different places and it can be a little confusing. We thought that we had to take the cats to a special USDA vet or something, but that wasn’t the case — our long time vet was able to do it and we just had to take the forms to the USDA/APHIS office.
Finally you have to call your airline and make sure they have an animal hold on the flight you want to book. Actually, technically, you want to do this first, since the rest of this is done in the last weeks before you take off. Then on the day of, you have to go to the cargo area of the airport and drop them off, present the forms the USDA gave you and off you go. When you land, you pick them up from the cargo area there. Not the easiest, certainly, but not impossible.
You can also bring smaller animals on the plane with you sometimes, but I thought our scaredy-cats would be less stressed if there weren’t a thousand people around.
Then it was just the moving process. We hired horrible movers who took forever, like multiple days, and still didn’t finish everything. Which means we ran out of time and I had to hire DeliverSF to come to our house after we had flown away to finish up everything.
We got an AirBNB in the last few days to stay in while we coordinated all the moving out and cleaning up.
Strangely, the morning we were to leave there was a 6.0 magnitude earthquake that woke me up a little early. I guess San Francisco didn’t really want me to leave. Finally, we got up and took a cab from the AirBNB in the early morning to the airport.
It’s actually pretty jarring to leave. All three of us have lived in California for our entire lives. Jess and I both grew up in Ventura and both went to college here. We moved to the Bay Area basically exactly the time we got married. Our entire 12 years of marriage, all of our real adult lives in truth, have been spent here. It is a world we know and a world we love. Stepping outside this zone of incredible comfort and support for us is harder than I thought it might be, the lure of adventure aside. However, I think it’s the right choice. Stepping into the uncomfortable is the only way to ever do anything truly amazing.
So, au revoir, San Francisco and hello, Paris! I hope you treat us well.

I kicked off the New Year alone in Paris with nothing to do.
It was my first ever New Year’s Eve spent out of the country, not to mention alone, and I had only a few short days to make a game plan. Right off the bat, I decided that, given the choice between an all-out nightclub with strobe lights and disco balls vs. staying home by myself with a bottle of red wine, I’d opt for the latter. But ideally I wanted to find some middle ground between the two — maybe a quaint bistro party with sparkling conversation en français, or possibly a sophisticated and slightly fancy family fête, complete with warm pork roasts, multiple rooms to roam, and a guest list of 40 people.
As soon as I started asking around, I quickly learned that local bistros either morph into club scenes or are shut down completely on New Year’s Eve. It would be hard, as a temporary city resident, to stumble upon the ideal setting and scenario on my own. I also discovered that most Parisians stay in for the ceremonious ball drop, surrounded by close friends and family, either gathering locally in the city or stead departing for their country homes. That left me with one option — somehow get invited to a Parisian house party.
There were two fairly significant problems with this plan:
Then of course there was the question of trust. You can’t just ask anybody off the street to join them for New Year’s Eve — there has to be some vetting factor to give yourself a little bit of security and peace of mind. So, over the next three days, I decided I needed to spend as much time as possible in local restaurants, cafés, and other local hangs in search of new friends to ring in the New Year.
As you know, I like traveling alone and do this with some regularity. It’s particularly fun for me to look for opportunities in social settings around me to interject myself and learn something new, and I have a few general rules that I follow when looking for the perfect hang:
With all this in mind, I set out to maximize the number of opportunities spent in these types of places over the next three days. Not going to lie — this is not always the most comfortable social experience. Here’s why. Even after I find a location — say, a café — that meets these criteria, the next thing to do is position myself in a location that invites conversation. If I’m at a bar or bistro bar, I will sit only one seat away from the next closest person at the bar, or sometimes even squeeze myself in as the open seat in between two smaller parties. This surprising social move, while slightly awkward for a moment, has been a pretty effective technique for me to at least trigger a small-talk conversation.
If there is nobody sitting in that area yet, the next best thing I can do is position myself in a highly trafficked location, make eye contact with everybody that walks by, and smile. In that one gesture I look for people who also happen to be showing up with a similar mission as myself: Making new fast friends. Sometimes, someone may walk in who’s meeting a friend running late, sometimes that smile may encourage somebody to sit down next to you, or sometimes I’ll get roped into a small group conversation nearby. Yes, I’ll be honest: This likely involves unbreaking eye contact with strangers for a few seconds longer than normal. The good news is that you can practice it and that there’s really no downside, as the chances of seeing anybody again are relatively remote.
If all else fails, I just use the resources around me and make small talk with the wait staff in French. In my case, this would inevitably throw off triggers and red flags to everyone around me that I’m not a native French speaker. Sometimes this would work to my advantage and another patron else would jump in and ask where I’m from. (People typically assume from my accent that I’m from the UK. On my proudest day ever in France, I was asked if I was from Belgium.)
But even if none of this happens and nobody strikes up a conversation with me, even if nobody sits close enough to me in order to start chatting, I have one strict rule for myself: Stay off my phone. Pulling out a smartphone at a restaurant or café is the kiss of death to meeting new people. It sends an instant sign to everyone around you that you’re more absorbed with whatever it is you’re doing, reading, or responding to than the environment around you. I’ve found that no matter how distractedly I fiddle with my phone, it’s still a real blocker toward meeting new friends in the real world. I try to keep it off the table and in my purse.
Instead, I carry a book. Oddly, reading a real, print book in public does not seem to have the same effect on people with regard to them keeping their distance. People seem to feel less threatened by it, and I get interrupted while reading all…the….time. The other benefit of having a book with you is that, even if you don’t achieve the holy grail of sparkling new conversation with strangers, at the very least you can fall back on a (hopefully) good read.
So, with this in mind and book in hand, I set out to make friends and conquer Paris. Some places where I made friends included:
But as of midday on December 31, while I had managed to meet about a dozen new people with these tactics, my New Year’s options consisted of the following:
Needless to say, this was not exactly what I was looking for.
When traveling alone, it’s always important to have a backup plan in any situation. In this case, my Plan B for New Year’s Eve was as follows: Wander around the neighborhood and try to find a happening (yet sophisticated) bistro party. (Note: This plan also also included stockpiling a bottle of champagne and some food at home, just in case I was unable to find anything interesting to do and needed to toast the New Year’s alone.)
I decided to take on a stretch of bistros in the 6th arrondissement along Boulevard Raspail, within walking distance of where I was staying. My loose game plan was this: Wander slowly past bistros, peer inside to scope out the scene and the people, and see if there is a venue or group that looks inviting enough for me to join. A few blocks away, I noticed a corner with 2–3 restaurants back-to-back. I decided to check it out. One of them was just a sit-down dinner spot, with families in mid-meal. The second was a bit more lightly populated without any buzz or energy whatsoever. The third, while also mostly comprised of families dining out, had one thing the other two didn’t — a large gathering area by the bar, which happened to be decked out with champagne flutes. Bingo.
Bypassing the crowds who were waiting for tables, I walked in, ordered myself a champagne, and waited. It was 9:30 p.m. Presently, there were two older couples at the bar and another family milling about. I guessed that more people would fill into this area as we approached midnight. I drank my champagne very….slowly…. But nothing happened. I passed the time by vigilantly watching the jazz combo that was floating through the restaurant and performing for different tables.
Unfortunately, by 10:15 p.m. not much had changed. Multiple other folks and families had wandered in and out of the bar, but merely as a holding area prior to their seated dinner. None of them seemed interested in talking to me. I was the only person there alone. Not great.
From the bartenders, I found out that there would be dancing downstairs leading up to midnight. “You’re in the right place,” he assured me. We’ll see about that, I thought. I looked outside. There were now easily 75 people waiting in a line to enter the building. So I decided to give it one more drink before trying my luck elsewhere. This time, I asked for a recommendation and was recommended a “mix-your-own” champagne cocktail with infused gin, raspberry syrup, and fresh berries.
About five minutes later, another couple approached the bar, decidedly younger than most of the other patrons I had met up that evening. They spoke in French with each other quietly as they poked through the cocktail menu, but then I heard the unmistakable query directed my way: “Excuse me, but what is it that you’re drinking?” I turned to see the woman pointing at my mix-your-own-drink creation and explained to her in French which beverage I had tried. She thanked me and turned back to her friend. She ordered the same drink. And, had I detected a faint accent in her French?
Going on a limb, I decided to try my luck, and I asked her in English: “Are you traveling in Paris as well for the New Year’s?” She looked at my silently for a full 10 seconds, and I panicked thinking how rude it was for me to assume her nationality. But then she replied. “Actually, yes. I’m working here teaching English to French children but I’m from Chicago. I’m Alina*. This is my friend, Georges*, a true Parisian, born and raised.”
This tiny intro was enough to catalyze a full-on conversation between the three of us, mostly in English, a little in French. I learned they were here because one of their good friends was the guitar player in the traveling jazz combo who had been performing around the restaurant.
“Oh bummer, you just missed them,” I remarked. “They were playing all over the restaurant but stopped about 20 minutes ago.”
“Actually, they are playing downstairs now,” Alina said. “We came to see them, and were supposed to be able to get in to see our friend but they told us that it’s for paying dinner guests only. We’re just waiting for them to come by the bar and let us down there.”
“Ah, so the dance party downstairs has already begun?” I asked. “Good to know. I’d love to check it out before I leave so let me know what you learn.”
We spent the next 10–15 minutes chit-chatting about my trip and their lives in Paris. He works in IT; she’s a new teacher who just moved to Paris a few months ago. They were both around my age. Georges grew up with Martin, the guitar player downstairs, and their friendship has continued to grow strong over the past decade or two. To show support for their friend, Alina and Georges left the house party to come and see their him perform. They really wanted to see the show.
At one point, Alina decides we should all make a break for it. Realizing that the entrance to the fete requires only acquiring a gold wristband at the door, we carried our cocktails and headed downstairs. Moments later, we found ourselves squarely secured inside of the jazz combo dance party, a spacious room lined on the perimeter with cocktail tables where families and couples sprinkled about. The room was bathed in a fuschia light, with the combo playing upfront. It’s decidedly classy. The lead singer fed the room’s vibe by offering us an American jazz classic; her nonchalance and easy vocalizations bounced off all of the walls.
The bar downstairs was lined with champagne flutes ready to be poured, and I headed over to investigate. But as soon as I did so, a man in a suit approached my new friends, sternly telling them in French something that appeared to make them both instantly dejected. At that, they started to head toward the door.
“Hey guys, wait — what’s up?” I called at them.
“We have to leave,” said Alina. “Apparently this party is for dinner guests only.”
“But don’t they know that you have a friend in the band?” I asked.
“Yes, we told them, but they are being super strict about it.”
“Hang on, that’s not fair. I didn’t have dinner here either.”
“Well you should stay for sure!” piped in Georges. “In fact, we need you to stay. Please go tell Martin how sorry we are that we weren’t able to see him.”
“What? So that’s it? You’re leaving?” I’m annoyed on their behalf. These folks came all the way from the 11th arrondissement to see their friend play on New Year’s Eve.
“Tell him we’ll be upstairs waiting. We’ll see you up there afterward I guess too,” said Alina, eying the door. “We have to go.”
And then they left, leaving me alone again. Glass of champagne in hand, I turned to face the music. But it wasn’t the same.
One of the best parts about traveling alone is that it’s pretty easy to slip through the cracks. If you walk into a packed restaurant with a line out the door, you can often cut it all on the spot by agreeing to sit in that one awkward seat at the bar. If you run into a café right as they are about to close, as just one person, they might make a late dish just for you. If you’re shopping at a boutique and trying to haggle for a certain promotional offer on your purchases, it’s more likely the shopkeeper will let an exception slide by for one person, as opposed to a small group. And if you’re hanging around a bar at a fancy bistro on New Year’s Eve for long enough, the bistro owners will decide it’s not a problem for you to bypass the “dinner guests only” rule and hang around until the clock strikes twelve.
But this time, it didn’t seem right for me to enjoy this party and the jazz combo while the friends who traveled across the whole city to see him couldn’t enjoy it too.
I considered my options:
Of the three of these, which do you think I chose?
A few more minutes passed as I assessed the scene around me. Waitstaff and bartenders were frantically darting in and out of the bar, preparing for the shift of the masses from upstairs to downstairs. But I needed a manager or head waiter of some sort. Finally, I saw a man in a custom-fit blazer race by me, monitoring the setting downstairs on his way.
“Excusez-moi de vous déranger, Monsieur, mais j’ai une petite question,” I announced. Translation: Sorry to bug you but I have a small question.
“Oui?” he turned his full attention to me. I began, to the best of my ability, a French persuasive argument.
“Well sir, as it turns out, I have two friends upstairs who at the bar who I would like to be able to join me downstairs. They are actually here because their friend is performing in the band, and they would really like to see him, but they were told that they can’t come downstairs as they did not eat dinner here. I understand this rule, but is there any way that they could come back downstairs with me to see him perform?”
He assessed me a bit more closely. I tried not to cringe at any grammar mistakes I had made in that plea. I thought about adding in one last caveat: “And since nobody here is dancing yet, I’m sure they would be up for it and liven up the room,” but decided against it, not knowing their tendencies in that area. At last, he nodded, took my champagne glass, and stowed it on the bar to be safe upon my return.
“Come with me,” he said. “Point out your friends to me.”
He hustled up the stairs, with me two quick steps behind. At the top, I stood next to him and pointed out the couple, and he rushed over to them, acknowledged what we had discussed, and began to lead them back in my direction. He had the hostess take care of their coats, and walked all three of us back downstairs together, calling out what he had done to the doorman on the way in.
And with that, we were reunited downstairs. Alina and Georges were elated, albeit a little confused. To be fair, so was I. But we didn’t overthink it. And within a matter of minutes, Alina (who apparently had taken years of swing dance classes back in the U.S.) was stepping her way around the dance floor. Georges, meanwhile, whose style seems more akin to that of Danny Kaye, literally stole the show on the last number with an improv piece of pantomime and hilarity as he cheered on his friend in the front of the room. It may have been one of the funniest things I have ever seen — it takes a truly brave soul to have no fear and to just dance with abandon like that. At the end of the set, the band got a hearty round of applause, and my new friends had their fair share of patrons run up to them and compliment their impressive dancing skills.
After the conclusion of the performance, I met the rest of the band, including Martin, the guitar player, and we spent the next 20–30 minutes chatting and dancing. But at 11:30 p.m., Alina and Georges realized that it was getting late, and they needed to head back to their other party. The three of them turned to me as they prepared to bundle up and leave: “Would you like to join us? We’re heading up to the 18th arrondissement with friends.”
I paused to consider my options. That was all the way across town, so if I were to attend, I would no longer be within walking distance of my return at the end of the evening. I looked back around the room again. While certainly a classy and fun party, being at this bistro alone was the epitome of finding loneliness in a crowd. Aside from Alina and Georges, nobody else had given me the time of day to chat. I decided I’d rather ring in midnight in the company of my new friends than around a group of anonymous strangers. It would be worth the trip. So the four of us hopped on the Metro.
As we approached the Concorde stop on the M8 line, my phone revealed that we’d crossed the threshold. “It’s midnight everyone!” I shouted to no one in particular. Our Metro car cheered. Outside we heard the roar of a collective crowd shouting and screaming somewhere above ground at Place de la Concorde. The doors closed and silenced the ceremony. Our driver gave the horn a few long “toots.” Alina started to sing “Auld Lang Syne.” By 12:01 we were already at the Madeleine Metro stop, and the moment had passed. It would be close to 12:30 a.m. before we would walk into the house party with more of their friends to be greeted by a warm group of Parisians in an apartment that smelled like a mix of champagne and cigarettes. And I wouldn’t have had it any other way.
*Not their real names.

In Woody Allen’s classic movie “Annie Hall,” he’s waiting in line outside a movie theatre and a pompous guy behind him is pontificating to his wife — pompsplaining — about Marshall McLuhan, the prophetic philosopher and educator on culture and technology. Allen gets into a heated argument with the guy, basically saying it’s ok to be totally wrong about McLuhan but just not so loud about it.
The guy self-importantly announces something like, “well I happen to be a professor at Columbia University and I teach a course on culture and media and I know my McLuhan.” To which Woody says, “oh really, well I happen to have Marshall McLuhan right here,” and he pulls the actual living Marshall McLuhan from behind a screen who proceeds to tell the professor, “I heard what you were saying, and you know nothing of my work. How you ever got to teach a course in anything is totally amazing to me.”
Is there any better way to win an argument? “Well, I’ve got Socrates right here and…”
As Woody Allen said, though, “wouldn’t it be great if real life were like this?” Which, of course, it isn’t. In real life, deliverance in an argument is many degrees of separation away.
Except in real life I had this experience (kinda) with a Pulitzer Prize winning poet. It turns out that only two degrees of separation is enough to get a real, live, acclaimed poet to personally settle a question about a poem.
But this was not a movie. In real life, nothing was delivered. I lost the debate.
I organize several poetry reading groups for people who are poetry-curious or poetry-reluctant. I’m no professor, no academic, I’m just an enthusiast who has discovered that it’s not hard to get even poetry-averse people enthused by and often in love with a poem, if the poem is any good.
For one group, I recently gathered a selection of poems about Paris, and one was by a poet whose name and work I was unfamiliar with. I had been hunting specifically for Paris poems so I’m sure I found this one by its title: “In Paris.” I was unfamiliar with the poet but instantly captured by the poem.
The poet is Carl Dennis. I figured I’d look him up to have something to say to the group. To my private (and now public) embarrassment and chagrin, Dennis was unknown to me but was hardly unknown outside my own little orbit. In 2002, he won a Pulitzer Prize in poetry, eclipsing the other two nominees, both of whom were future Pulitzer winners. His poetry has been published in many important magazines and poetry journals, including some I have occasion to read.
I also learned that Dennis taught for years in the English Department at the State University of New York at Buffalo, where the faculty included renowned poets whose names I did know and have even read, like Robert Creeley, Charles Olson, Susan Howe, Anselm Hollo, and Charles Bernstein. (Disclosure: I’m no fan of the “schools” of poetry these poets were part of and I don’t read much of their stuff.)
To make matters even worse for me, I went to SUNY/Buffalo. And I was an English major. And I was learning there (allegedly) while Carl Dennis was teaching there. We were one degree of separation away as I walked past his classroom.
Maybe he only taught graduate students. Or may it was the early 1970’s and I was a long-haired kid from Brooklyn whose main influence was Groucho Marx and Jefferson Airplane. And Dennis really was an unknown poet back then. So our one-degree gap was all it took to keep me in the dark.
But for present purposes, I now had my intro about Dennis for the poetry group. Everyone had a good laugh when I gave this background about my unknown poet, after which I read his poem aloud.
And for a long while no one spoke. You could hear the silent re-reading, the thinking, the unsaid questioning. We were all engaged, provoked by a poem, and, since the poem was about Paris, maybe a little in love. Here’s the poem.
Today as we walk in Paris I promise to focusMore on the sights before us than on the womanWe noticed yesterday in the photograph at the print shop,The slender brunette who looked like youAs she posed with a violin case by a horse-drawn omnibusNear the Luxembourg Gardens. Today I won’t linger longOn the obvious point that her name is as lost to historyAs the name of the graveyard where her bonesHave been crumbling to dust for over a century.The streets we’re to wander will shine more brightlyNow that it’s clear the day of her deathIs of little importance compared to the momentCaught in the photograph as she makes her wayThrough afternoon light like this toward the Seine.The cold rain that fell this morning has given way to sunshine.The gleaming puddles reflect our moodJust as they reflected hers as she stepped around themSmiling to herself, happy that her auditionAn hour before went well. After practicing scalesFor years in a village whose name isn’t recorded,She can study in Paris with one of the masters.No way of telling now how close her lifeCame to the life she hoped for as she rambled,On the day of the photograph, along the quay.But why do I need to know when she herself,If offered a chance to peruse the book of the future,Might shake her head no and turn away?She wants to focus on her afternoon, now almost gone,As we want to focus on ours as we standHere on the bridge she stood on to watchThe steamers push up against the current or ease down.This flickering light on the water as boats pass byIs the flow that many painters have tried to captureWithout holding too still. By the time these boats arriveFar off in the provinces and give up their cargoes,Who knows where the flow may have carried us?But to think now of our leaving is to wrong the moment.We have to be wholly here as she wasIf we want the city that welcomed herTo welcome us as students trained in her schoolTo enjoy the music as much as she didWhen she didn’t grieve that she couldn’t stay
Time steals us all away and leaves photos as proof of existence.
This narrative poem — a dramatic monologue — is teeming with imagery, feeling, and thought. Time, the ephemerality of the moment, Paris, romance, obsession, the flowing Seine, sepia-toned photographs, photography’s power and powerlessness: the group discussed all these things, and more I’m sure.
The speaker is in Paris with his — wife? paramour? friend? — and he knows she is frustrated with him. He’s obsessed with a 19th century photograph they saw in a print shop of a Parisian street scene with a woman carrying a violin case. He can’t stop thinking of the woman, long gone from Paris, faraway from now, and lost to history.
We all could relate to both sides of the poem’s modern-day scenario. On one side of the couple’s dilemma is the seductive power that a photograph has over the narrator (and, by proxy, over us readers). The other side of the dilemma is the “here and now” that the narrator’s companion wants to enjoy while strolling with her man.
Reflecting the narrator’s obsession, the present-day “she” in the poem is barely there. We know much more about the long-gone woman in the photograph. “Enough already,” we imagine the living woman wants to say, but she doesn’t have a voice in the poem. The narrator simply tells us, “She wants to focus on her afternoon, now almost gone.”
But wait! The woman who “wants to focus on her afternoon” is the woman in the old photograph, not the woman in the present. This man cannot stop thinking of that ghost in the image. “Paris is laid out in splendor before you now!” I want to shout at him. “Pay attention to the angel in front of you!” But I cannot reach the inattentive narrator who is just a disembodied “voice” in a poem, just as he cannot reach the woman in a faded image from the 19th century.
Look how he can’t stop himself! He promised — promised! — in the poem’s first line to “focus on the sights before us” rather than on the beguiling antique photograph. “Focus” is what he says — just like a camera does. Perhaps “focus” is not the reassuring word the narrator should have chosen, but it’s honest because his focus keeps returning to the camera’s subject a century earlier. He says he won’t “linger long” on her death, as he clearly already has and proceeds to do some more.
About halfway through the poem, the sun comes out and it seems like our haunted hero is going to come back to the present. He sees how “the gleaming puddles reflect our mood,” and he all but says “honey! I’m home!” But, no, he falls instead through the camera’s time portal back to the muddy puddles that his 19th century inamorata is stepping around as she smiles to herself. At this point in his preoccupation, the narrator exceeds the four corners of the photograph and simply creates unknowable facts about her successful audition and her musical studies.
Just as things are getting a little out of hand, the narrator — and the poem — asks an important question: why does he care what became of his enchantress if she herself, living wholly, didn’t care to “peruse the book of the future”?
Why does he care? What ensnares him? Photography gives us the illusion that we can stop time right — snap! — now. Old photographs let us imagine more fully this vanished place in that vanished time, like the prototypical 1838 photograph of a Paris street, above. They let us meet and look into the eyes of the dead. Haven’t you looked at a photo from, say, Coney Island in the 1920’s and thought “every one of these people is gone”? Or from the 1960’s and wondered “what became of them”?
Time steals us all away and leaves photos as proof of existence.
As if answering the question “why do I care,” the poem now plunges into the river of time with its boats and flickering lights and its Heraclitean flow, never captured in art, that leads who knows where. The narrator is having, perhaps, a mini-Whitmanesque moment, crossing the Seine rather than Crossing Brooklyn Ferry, seeing the same boats the slim brunette saw (“steamers”) and the same flickering lights she saw, and knowing now he must not “wrong the moment.”
When the narrator resurfaces, he knows it is important to be “wholly here.” (“Wholly” is such a perfect word!) Across a century, the woman in old Paris has reminded him that we are here but briefly, like the blink of a camera’s shutter. He comes to see that the city of Paris will “welcome us as students trained in her school/ To enjoy the music as much as she did.” Her school? The Music School of the Holy Here.
So wake up, take your present-day companion’s hand, and watch for puddles.
But there’s a little more to my story about Carl Dennis and Buffalo, New York. Though we might easily have knocked our coffees onto each other’s plaid shirts in the makeshift English Department hallways in, say, 1972, I assumed that 50+ years on, Carl and I had drifted apart to the expected six degrees of separation, or more.
But no, we were a mere two degrees of separation away. Go know! One of the people in the poetry group, Eva, lives in Buffalo. When we read “In Paris” in our group, she said, “Hey, Carl is a neighbor of mine! He lives a couple of houses away.” Wow! So do you know him? “Yeah, of course, but as a neighbor, not as a famous poet.” So cool!
We discussed the poem as a group for a good long time. It felt like we were on that Paris bridge, like we could see the woman in the photograph, like we knew how to be mad at our partners for “wronging the moment” and not being “wholly here” when presence mattered.
But then I pointed out: “look, this poem doesn’t have a period at the end of the last sentence.” It seemed odd to me, and I checked my source for the poem, the Academy of American Poets online. Nope, no period. See for yourself.
What does it mean to leave a poem open-ended like that? Poets don’t do this for no reason, after all. I’m sure I mentioned Emily Dickinson’s defiance of punctuation conventions.
What does the grammatical caesura do in this particular poem?
Does it hint at the continuing, endless nature of Time?
Does it signify something about indeterminacy? but of what? the moment? our relationships?
Are we intended to go back to the start of the poem, like James Joyce made us do in Finnegans Wake (mostly written in Paris!) where the final sentence (“A way a lone a last a loved a long the”) has no period and flows like the River Liffey into the opening sentence (“riverrun, past Eve and Adam’s, from swerve of shore to bend of bay,”)?
I even checked “In Paris” to see if that worked. It does, if you want it to.
Eva said, “I have an idea! I’ll text Carl and ask!” Fantastic! And she did. “Hey, Carl, we’re reading your poem ‘In Paris!’” And he replied something like I can’t believe anybody’s reading that old poem. And she then asked, “what does it mean that there’s no period at the end?”
And much like Marshall McLuhan, he replied, “That’s a mistake. It’s supposed to be there.”
So much for the River Liffey.
Ok, the sepia-toned woman, so busy with living, “didn’t grieve that she couldn’t stay PERIOD.” Got it. Message to the poem’s speaker from two women, one on the bridge now, one there a hundred years ago: when in Paris, be in love or at least be here now. PERIOD.
“In Paris” was published in Dennis’s 1993 poetry collection The Near World. Unlike the poem’s distracted narrator who was focused on the deep past, the poetry group was reading a modern poem written in our lifetimes. But we were like the narrator in one respect: we were enthralled. We were in Paris, and I think we were falling in love with this poem.
And now, weeks after the poetry group discussion, I find myself re-reading Dennis’s poem umpteen times, poring over it like a man staring at a very old photograph while I’m working on this piece. It’s taken all day, and soon my wife and I have somewhere to be. I hear her call from the other room, “It’s time to go. Enough with that poem already!” I am here and it is now and we do have to go.
Because the poem above is exactly what I shared with the group, you’ll note there’s no period at the end. Since I have it on good authority that a period belongs there, I’m duty-bound to offer the correct last line: “When she didn’t grieve that she couldn’t stay.” Ah, so much better!
“In Paris” lead me to Dennis’s books of poetry which are now 14 in total plus one book of essays. I’ve bought several now, including his last, Earthborn. Many colleagues and commenters describe his poetry as thoughtful, sensitive, focused on the everyday, accessible, meditative, humane. All true. But I haven’t found any mention of how funny, how deeply wryly funny, Dennis can be.
In “Primitive,” he refrains from killing a spider in his house in order to avoid the slippery ethical slope toward killing a few people he knows. In “Progressive Health,” he advises healthy organ donors for perfectly ethical reasons not to wait another day before donating their organs. In poems like “Eurydice” and “The God Who Loves You,” you’ll laugh but only to keep from crying. Find them, read them.
The God who loves me whispers that he bets that Carl Dennis likes Groucho Marx and thinks Groucho was a good a preceptor for me in college as any of Carl’s smart colleagues.

Paris is one of the world’s great cities. History, architecture, museums, food, culture, beauty, and walkability make Paris one of the world’s most popular travel destinations, with more than 30 million annual tourists and millions more business travelers. Despite this, Paris has had the reputation of not being a great running city, with crowds, pollution, congestion, and relative lack of running culture being cited as the cause. But this has started to change in the past few years, and we’re pleased to report that there are some fantastic running options in Paris. If you are staying in the heart of the city, running along the Seine is a treat, especially since there are now seamless paths, separated from cars, that go on for miles. One can also put together a nearly 10-mile “highlights of Paris” tour, which includes The Louvre, Eiffel Tower, Champs Elysées, and the city’s famous parks and gardens all in one run. Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes are two large and wonderful city parks at either edge of the city. And running along the Canal St. Martin’s meandering paths out to Parc de Villette is a treat. Further afield, running at Versailles will make you feel like a king.
A great resource for running in Paris is Free Paris Running Tours. Luke and his team lead wonderful, free running tours of one of the world’s most beautiful cities.
Staying inside the main beltway surrounding Paris will provide access to decent running options (see our “stay” section for recommendations). Good anchor/departure points for our best runs are Notre Dame (“Cité), La Bastille, and La Defense. A few particular recommendations for running in Paris: if you want to see some of the ‘tourist’ highlights, try to go early to avoid the crowds; take advantage of the fabulous public transportation and bike sharing system, which puts you within a 10–20 minute subway ride from some of the best runs, or allows you to do a longer ‘one way’ run; and pay attention to closing times for some of the parks. Also when we say “12e” that means “12th arrondissement”.
Paris is generally quite flat. There are hills in some of the park runs. As for weather, in Paris it is fairly continental. Winters can be chilly and damp, with occasional but rarely significant snow. Summers are generally lovely, with long days, and rarely overly hot, but quite humid.
7.3 miles, RT. Start: Notre Dame, Ile de la Cite. MAPOptions for longer — head west on south side from Champs de Mars.
Running on the banks of the Seine is one of the great runs of the world. Over the past few years, several sections have been turned into pedestrian-only paths, below the road, making running along the Seine in the heart of Paris a running heaven. Along the river, there are also great views of Paris’ wonderful buildings and landmarks. Starting at Notre Dame (or any point), head east on Ile La Cite over to Ile St. Louis, crossing a bridge over to the north side, or right bank. Then head west along the river, passing numerous landmarks: Centre Pompidou, the Louvre, Jardin de Tuilleries, Place de La Concorde, and the Modern Art Museum. At just over 4 miles, opposite Jardins de Trocadero, cross the Pont d’Ilena, over to the left bank. Head back east. Some of the nicest sections of the river run are along a section called Les Berges, between the Pont de l’Alma and the Musée D’Orsay. This section was formerly a highway but was beautifully developed into a path two years ago. Shorten the run doing less of the path or add to/vary it with incredible detour opportunities: Tuilleries, Champs-Elysees, Jardins de Trocadero, Champs de Mars, and Invalides. Adding all those would make this a 10-miler or so.
7 miles, out and back. Start: Champs de Mars. MAP
This can be part of a longer run or a distinct run. We continue the above, running west of Pont d’Ilena, along the lovely thin path of Ile aux Cygnes, then doing a tour of the park on Ile St. Germain. It can be joined with any parts of Seine run above, or any of the wonderful detours.
7.5 miles. Start: Pont Neuf. MAP
This route has all the best of the heart of Paris, combining parts of the Seine paths with some of the city’s most famous landmarks and beautiful places. Start on Pont Neuf, and head to the north side (‘right bank’) of the river. Run by the Louvre into the Jardin des Tuileris, straight into the Place de la Concorde and then along the wide paths of the Champs Elysées, continuing along the famous shopping section, to Charles De Gaulle Etoile/Arc de Triomphe. Take Rue Kleber south, to the Trocadero, and the gardens, with a great view of the Eiffel Tower. Cross the Pont d’Ilena, do a quick little tour around the Tower, and then along the wonderful paths of the Champ de Mars and then the paths through Invalides. The last mile is along the left bank of the river, passing the Musee d’Orsay.
Some of these areas are major sites on their own, so of course it’s possible to do just some sections.
The heart of Paris is graced by wonderful and historic parks. All have dedicated pedestrian paths wide enough for running. There are many options for running one or more of these parks, incorporating other sites and parts of the Seine river paths. Rather than proscribe a particular ‘run’, here’s a bit of info on each of the main parks.
Long: 8.8 miles RT, starting at the Arc de Triomphe. MAP. Short: save two miles by starting at Port Dauphine10k in the Park: follow “Tour de Longeur” from the Port de la Muette entrance
This is the loveliest, shadiest place for running in the heart of Paris. You’ll find hundreds of fellow joggers on a nice evening. There are some 35 miles of trails in the park. It’s hard to proscribe a particular run, but your best bet is to run around Lac Inferieur and Lac Superieur (5k). Then there’s the option to head toward the northwestern part of the park, using any one of a number of paths. On the good maps at all trail intersections, look for the 10k “Tour de Longeur”, most easily accessible from the Port de La Muette entrance. Our route starts at the Arc de Triomphe just for kicks. Easily accessible by Metro. Combine with Parc St. Cloud for an even longer run.
4.76 mile loop. Start: Chateau Vincennes metroGood add-on option: Run there from City Hall (Hotel de Ville). 3.7 miles one-way. MAP
This is the largest park in Paris, about 4 miles east of Notre Dame in the 12th arrondissement. The park was created between 1855 and 1866 by the Emperor Napoleon III. There are beautiful paths for running in this park. Highlights include the medieval Chateau de Vincennes, an arboretum, floral gardens, and numerous other natural and recreational facilities. The best bet is to randomly enjoy the miles of paved and unpaved paths. A tour of the outer perimeter trails is ~4.5 miles. Other options: 1 mile around Chateau de Vincennes; 1.4m around Lac Daumsenil. Or look for the “Circuits Pedestres”, which include 11k and 8k loops. Many more trails can be added. The trails are well signed, with mile markers. 15 minutes by metro. A good option for a longer run is from City Hall, which takes you by Bastille and then on some greenways and good running roads into the park. Do it one way and take the Metro back! Or, take the Promenade Plantée path back to Bastille, from Port Dorée entrance.
2.4 miles O-W. Start: Bastille or Porte de Montempoivre (metro Bel Air). MAPAdd-on options: Bois de Vincennes, Parc des Buttes Chaumont
This is a favorite Paris off-road path. Created out of an abandoned metro line, PlantPé is an elevated, paved linear park that runs 2.4 miles from Bastille in the Eleventh arrondissement to Porte de Montempoivre. You’ll see lots of other runners, and inline skaters. Just beneath the path, along the viaduct, there are shops, markets, and artist studios. There are numerous entrance gates along the way, each with their own opening/closing times. For a longer run, continue from the end of the path into Bois de Vincennes, which is 0.5 miles using Rue Sacrot (look for the Porte Dorée entrance), or mid-way along the Plantée path, from Jaures, head 1/2 mile east to Parc des Buttes Chaumont. Good hills there. Notes: There are signs that say “This place is a space for walking. Jogging is tolerated only to the extent that it doesn’t disturb walkers.”
5km of trails and good hills. Easy access via metro. Also 1/2 mile east of Promenade Plantée, 1/2 mile south of Parc de Villette.
A great park to do some hills. Unveiled at the 1867 World’s Fair, this park is sometimes referred to as the ‘Central Park’ of Paris. About 5km of trails, with the hilliest in the interior. Great to combine with Parc de Villette, or Promenade Plantée.
Short option: 3.2/6.4 miles out & back/RT. Start: Bastille. MAPLong Option: 5.2/10.4 miles out & back/RT. Start: Bastille. MAP
This is another wonderful linear park option from the heart of Paris. It follows the Canal St. Martin, which meanders its way from near the Bastille to Parc de Villette. The towpath is very pretty, with lovely chestnut trees shading some sections. The first section on our map is hard to see because it is below the street. Runners have a few options here: run one-way, 3.2 miles, and then hop on the metro back — multiple stations along the way and at the Parc. Or, it’s 6.4 miles RT. A longer option is to to enjoy some of the paths in Parc de Villette. A more modern, landscaped park, with interesting sites such as the Géode, a 36-diameter sphere, garden of mirrors, the garden of trellises, and the garden of islands, connected by ~2 miles of paths. Then return, for a long 10.4 mile run, or hop the metro.
4.2 miles RT. Start: Esplanade de La Defense metro. MAPAdd-ons: it’s 3k to the Palais de Congrès, which also abuts Bois de Boulongne, and 4k to the Arc de Triomphe.
La Défense is Paris’ version of London’s Canary Wharf/Docklands. It’s a business-centric district of modern office buildings on the edge of town. It started in the 1970s but it is still growing. As with most things Paris, this area has been built on a grand, post-modernist scale. It’s pretty convenient — ~2 miles from the convention center. Running in this area is pretty good: long, wide plazas and pathways with trees, monuments, and places to shop and eat. Start at the Esplanade de Défense or anywhere in that vicinity, and continue along the Allée to the Grand Arch, which is a modern version of the Arc de Triomphe (note it is is a 5k straight shot from ‘Arc to Arche’). Note it’s a bit tricky connecting from the Arche into Nanterre, but a run into Parc André Malraux is worthwhile. There are ~2 miles of trails in here, including a couple of hills! On the return, pass by the “Cloud Towers”, and Rue Hoche leads to a bridge over the freeway and back into the La Defense area. There are good, business-y hotels in La Defense area.
Paris is a huge city. There are runs possible in every arrondissement or suburb. Here, we’ve highlighted some of the best ‘destination’ runs.
6.4 mile loop. Start: City Hall, Versailles. MAPEasily accessible by public transport from Paris. Open 8am-6pm
One of the most significant palaces in the world is also a great running destination. The Versailles Gardens are huge and open to the public, with many wonderful landmarks, including great views of the palace, a section of formal gardens and highly sculpted allées, and then, further westward, bucolic paths going by farms and fields. A great ~10k run is to start at City Hall right in Versailles, head into the Palace grounds, and along the formal gardens to the perimeter of the Grand Trianon, and then on the paths of the perimeter of the Canal and fountains. This is a total 6.4 mile loop. It’s easy to add another couple of miles using some of the more remote paths in the northern section of the park or running along the outer perimeter paths.
5 miles. Start: at park. Metro: St. Cloud, Boulogne. MAP
This beautiful park is a wonderful running option south of the 15th arrondissement, and not far from Bois de Boulogne. It has some of the most beautiful gardens in Europe. There are wonderful allées and paths for running. A good tour can easily add up to 5 miles.
Paris has a great variety of hotels. And even though the metropolitan area is large, anywhere inside the inner beltway (Blvd. Peripherique) will put you within a 1–2 miles of a good running option. It’s 7–8 miles east-west or north-south within the beltway. That said, easy access to the Seine and the major tourist sites, is in the 1st-7th Arrondissements. Arrs. 13–15, and 20 might have more budget friendly accommodation options but are a bit further from some of our best routes. But even if you end up some distance from an “ideal” running location, try to stay near a metro stop, as that will put you within 15–20 minutes of somewhere great for running. If traveling to Paris for business, it’s fine to stay in La Defense/Convention Center area. There’s good running there, and it’s not far from the Arc de Triomphe, and the Bois de Boulogne.
There is a growing number of running specialty stores in Paris:
Passion Running. Locations near La Bastille, Bois de Boulogne, and the outer 15th Arr. Group Runs: Saturday mornings.
Planet Jogging. Great location between convention center and Etoile.
Endurance Shop. Nearly 100 locations in France. In Paris, they have a store at Montparnasse, and at Versailles.
KM42. Near Parc Monceau. Having to do with the Paris Marathon.
Boutique Marathon. Near Parc Monceau and also Bercy.
There are also Nike, Adidas, and New Balance stores within the heart of Paris.
A great resource for running in Paris is Free Paris Running Tours. Luke and his team lead wonderful, free running tours of one of the world’s most beautiful cities.
Paris Running Tour also offers guided runs of Paris

Paris is home to the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, the Notre Dame and many more iconic landmarks. It is the city of fashion, haute cuisine and lights. As one of the most popular tourist destinations, it exerts an enormous attraction to people all over the globe: in 2023 it received more international visitors than New York, Bangkok or Mecca.
When we think of Paris, we picture a city with grand boulevards, lined with stately buildings, between which little alleyways meander. Here locals chatter on the outdoor terraces of countless bistros and brasseries while enjoying the culinary delights.
This romantic image of the French capital is true only to some extent. It’s not something the majority of the 11 million inhabitants of the Paris metropolitan area experience in their daily lives. Paris has long outgrown its historic core: most of the people who consider themselves Parisains today live in the city’s suburbs: the banlieues.
The Paris within the Périphérique (the ring road which encircles Paris proper) is world-famous. The suburbs which lay outside it remain mysterious places.
In today’s article, I want to shine a light on Paris’s banlieues: their history, their development and their…

How long do you have to be visiting a city before you start to feel like a local? Or, maybe it has more to do with how you spend your days rather than a length of time. When I spent a week in Paris last year with my best friend, her Apple watch clocked us at about 24,000 steps a day. We did all the usual touristy things: Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Sacre Coeur, the Louvre, etc. But I’ve always longed to visit a foreign city and live like a local instead. Getting to know a city on a deeper level is hard to do when you’re in hardcore tourist mode. So, I decided to pack up my laptop to spend a month working remotely in Paris this summer — with the intention to live like une vrai Parisienne, at least for a little while.
One of my biggest pet peeves is looking like a typical American tourist. It can’t be helped most of the time, but there have been trips where I’ve gone out of my way to avoid it. For example, when I traveled to Turkey for 10 days, I arrived with freshly dyed dark-brown hair and a carefully culled suitcase devoid of sneakers or anything made of denim. Apparently, it worked. A few times, locals spoke to me in Turkish, and a few tourists even stopped me to ask for directions.
This time around, I’m not focused on blending in, especially not clothes-wise. That’s impossible in such a fashion-conscious city filled with genetically chic inhabitants. Besides, I need my comfy shoes. Instead, I want to do more ordinary things to fill my days. Yes, there will be sightseeing on my days off, and of course I will be taking beaucoup photos. But when I walk out the front door of my flat in the 5th arrondissement, I want to “have the air of” a local, as the French would put it.
To me, that means heading to a farmers market to buy the week’s fruits and vegetables, going for a morning run along the Seine, reading Le Monde over my morning coffee, watching French TV, going to a movie theater, listening to French pop music on the radio, reading a book in a park, and cooking myself dinner. I thought about bringing my laptop to a cafe and working there for a few hours, but I’m afraid that it would make me look too American. I’m pretty sure Parisians don’t mix work with pleasure.
I’m hoping that mundane tasks like doing laundry will make me feel more like a local and less like a tourist. I’ll have my own washer and dryer in the flat I’m renting. People don’t usually wash their clothes when they’re staying in hotels, at least not the proper way. My husband admits he once washed his clothes in the dishwasher on a business trip! I’m no better. When I was a teenager, I went on a trip to Europe with my high school, and our first stop was Paris. The bathroom in the hotel room I shared with my friends had a toilet and sink (of course). But it also had this weird “bonus sink” that was lower to the ground and had faucets to turn on hot and cold water. My best guess, being only sixteen, was that it was for washing clothes, so that’s what I did. Not long after, I learned what a bidet was and realized in horror that I had washed my underwear and socks where previous hotel guests had washed their, um, dirty derrières.
Another embarrassing laundry faux pas came only about a decade later while on my honeymoon in Germany and Austria. We were in the alpine city of Salzburg, staying in this lovely hotel recommended by Rick Steves, my favorite travel writer and host of a TV travel show on PBS. We even sported Rick Steves’ official backpacks that I had borrowed from a friend so that we could carry our luggage on our backs like seasoned pros. Well, it didn’t take long for me to get blisters from walking with all that extra weight. When we got to the hotel, I was definitely in the mood to treat myself to a luxury. So, when I saw a white plastic bag hanging in our hotel room closet, I decided to use the hotel’s laundry service instead of washing my socks and underwear in the sink. It wasn’t until I got everything back that I realized it was a dry-cleaning service, not laundry. I was both horrified and oddly impressed at how each pair of socks and underwear was carefully pinned to cardboard and artfully wrapped in tissue paper like little Christmas presents.
Ever since that first trip to Europe as a teenager, I yearned to live abroad someday. I had hopes of being a travel writer like Rick Steves or Bill Bryson and wanted to move to Europe. I also wanted to become fluent in Spanish, a language I had studied in school for eight years but never could master. Alas, none of that was meant to be. But as Edith Piaf would croon: Je ne regrette rien. I regret nothing. I’ve had a fulfilling career as a technical writer for almost 20 years now, and I’ve taken some pretty cool trips, though mostly as a tourist.
Very early in my career, I did have some luck getting a travel article published in my hometown newspaper, the Bristol Pilot. I had decided to do a work abroad program right after college and lived in London for six months on a special visa. After two weeks of pounding the pavements, I landed a job as a receptionist for World Imports, an importer of Mexican beers like Corona and Modelo Negra to the U.K. I had always known that my hometown of Bristol, Pa., was named after Bristol, England, so I decided to take a trip there one Saturday and document my experience. The article was titled “Tales of Another Bristol,” or something like that. It was the only travel article I’ve ever had published.
There was no question about feeling like a local during my London days, that’s for sure. I did mundane things every day. For one, my job as a receptionist was pretty boring. Most of the time I just sat there waiting for the phone to ring. Sometimes I would deliver faxes or make coffee for visitors. A lot of my coworkers spoke Spanish, so to kill time I would practice translating letters and have them check it. Commuting to work was another drag. There were times when I would be running late for work (yet again) all sweaty and out of breath from running for the train, with a big knot in my stomach anticipating getting in trouble by the owner, Alphonso, and I would want to just break down and cry. But I would remind myself that at least I was in London, and that seemed to make it all better.
So, this idea for a 30-day mini adventure in Paris is a small step toward fulfilling a lifelong dream of living abroad, though I’m more into learning French these days than Spanish. In fact, I’ll be attending my twice-weekly French class online while I’m there. With the time difference, it won’t start until midnight! Another adjustment will be my work schedule. I plan to start at 2 p.m. so that I can still make scheduled meetings with my East Coast colleagues, which means I’ll be working into the night. But the upside is I’ll have my mornings free. Also, the sun doesn’t set until 10 p.m. in Paris in the summer, making the days feel longer.
Eventually, I plan to document here on Medium how it all went. Will I feel like a local after only 30 days? Will I get asked for directions while lugging home groceries or doing some other ordinary chore? Will I master the European washer and dryer and other foreign appliances without blowing any fuses? One thing is for certain: If I encounter a vintage bidet somewhere, I’ll know exactly what NOT to do.

Victor Hugo, Marcel Proust, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and many others have captured the essence of Paris in their writing, and numerous poets have used this city as their muse. For artists and creators, Paris is a city of sensations, of layers, of contrasts and defies easy categorisation.
Walking the streets of this city, I felt all the hopes, aspirations and fantasies that are often excluded from my conscious personality in everyday life come alive—the determination never to be disappointed by life, to see only what is beautiful, good and kind.
I had strangers smiling at me and that lively “Bonjourrrr”. I admired Parisians going about their daily lives, running up and down the path beside the Seine. I watched a group of French women having their passionate intellectual debates in a restaurant before going to their yoga class. I watched people wandering through the Sunday flea market in search of the perfect vintage garment. I have admired femininity and the art of true seduction, the very definition of naked couture at a cabaret show, reminiscent of a simpler time when natural beauty was cherished.
For artists who have often felt left out or like they don’t belong because their upbringing or culture doesn’t support the arts or embrace creativity, Paris is a breath of fresh air. Going to a country where the government itself has a history of supporting the arts and culture makes you feel seen and understood.
Sous le ciel de Paris, I was reminded that what I do matters, and for the first time I didn’t feel that my romanticism was being challenged or stifled. I didn’t feel at war with myself.
I felt at peace.

Outline of a talk at the Critical University 15 May 2021
If we go back to March 18th, and look at the famous imagery of the National Guard on their barricades, we’re only seeing one half of the story. This is the French labour movement as it saw itself: orderly, respectable and quite obviously gendered — the men have the guns, flags and uniforms, the women and children stand to the side.
The battalions were rooted in local communities but, as Martin Phillip Johnson shows, there was a lot of crossover — so that a man in one area might actually travel to be with friends in another area’s battalion. Which suggests they were based both on community and workplace.
But March 18th itself, and the subsequent trajectory of the Commune as a revolutionary government, involved a completely different demographic: la canaille, the mob: the shanty-dwelling ultra poor, including migrants from outside Paris, overlapped with the classic bohemia of artists, impoverished law students, registered sex workers, slum children… and nobody took their photos, although they drew them.

On 20th May 2024, our most awaited day was here. It was the first day of our fortnight-long planned package tour of Europe. We covered the following countries- Netherlands, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Italy, Slovenia, Vatican, and Germany for a span of two weeks.
This trip was a result of three months of extensive planning and preparation. There were massive discussions and contradictions within our family on which travel agency should we choose, which itinerary, the budget, VISA appointment, purchasing and much more.
We consulted many relatives, friends, family friends, those who have been on a European trip, and much more. At last, we booked our travel with Soman’s Leisure Tours, Kochi. On 30th April, we had our VISA appointment.
On the 10th we had an online meeting with the tour company explaining the guidelines for the trip. They instructed us about currency, international SIM and much more.
18th, Saturday was the day when we started to put together things. Despite that, we could not have successful progress on that. On the 19th we had to go to our ancestral place hence, it was indeed a tight…

Yayyyy!! Its summer, its vacation time.
This Year we are planning to Visit Paris. ( I’ve already been to Paris though )
This would be the 1st time my wife / kid and my in-laws would visit Paris. I quickly wanted to share with you our 3 day Itenerary.
Paris is a city that is full of history, art, culture, and great food (especially if you are into French cuisine). There is no one perfect itinerary for visiting Paris, but here is a suggested 3-day itinerary that will help you get a taste of the best that the capital of France has to offer:
Day 1:
Day 2:
Day 3:
This itinerary will give you a taste of the best (or the most famous) that Paris has to offer, but there is so much more to see and do in this incredible city.
If you have more time, be sure to explore the lesser-known neighborhoods and attractions. Personally, I like the Catacombs, the Père Lachaise Cemetery (graves of Jim Morrison or Chopin, but also a nice walking area) or just visiting Sunday morning local markets…
Plenty to see and do.
If you had something to take away, add a clap / respond / highlight / follow me and subscribe to get emails as soon as I publish. We all go further when we help each other!”
Cheers — KS !!

I think the way French people say, “Bonjour!” is sensuous. Just two syllables. Or two musical notes, rather.
Shopkeepers, waitstaff, and bartenders all seem to sing when they greet me with “Bonjour!” or “Bonjour, monsieur!”
Nothing about me asks to be serenaded. I’m an older American male of Chinese ethnicity, not immediately charismatic, nor sharply dressed, nor classically good-looking, nor anything. On my better days, I could perhaps pass for an expatriate, but more often, I probably come off as a seasoned tourist, which, at least, is accurate.
Everyone gets this greeting, not just me. But alas, not everyone responds in a way that matches the greeter’s sensuality. They should. We could all use a bit more sensuality in our lives, no matter how small.
I wish to blend in, to “live like a local” as many travelers like to say. So, whenever I’m greeted, I feel the need to respond in kind. Thus, I reply, “Bonjour!” in the best French I can muster, which causes me to mimic that same songlike quality. “Bonjour!” I feel better just saying, er, singing it.
For example, I found myself singing at 9:15 am as I entered La Crémaillère 1900 in Montmartre on a chilly, misty April morning. Still sleepy, and before my morning coffee.
Singing “Bonjour!” in response to the server uplifts me. Sure, it’s only two notes, but it’s two more notes than I sing when I enter a café near my home in New York City.
By the way, I wrote my first draft of this story in this café, and all the photos in this article are of this establishment.
If you must ask, I had the “Pain perdu au caramel beurre salé” or “Salted butter caramel French toast.” Yes, it was as sensuously decadent as that reads.
Some say that “Paris est un village,” and I can see why. Few other large cities I’ve experienced greet me like I’m in a small town, but people here do this naturally.
I found out later that all of French society conspires to do this, not just Parisians. French children are consistently taught to say “bonjour” and “au revoir” to their peers and adults. Some say it’s a way to acknowledge another’s humanity.¹
I live in New York City, where we value efficiency. We can’t be bothered with fussy things like greetings, especially with strangers. Often just a direct, “Do you have the time?” or “I’d like a matcha oat latte, please!”
But is it really that fussy? It’s not like I’m being asked to say, “Good day to you, madame. You look quite well today.” Saying “hello” is only two syllables, just like in French!
I’m resolved to acknowledge my fellow New Yorkers’ humanity when I get home. I will sing “Hello!” to all of them, even if things get awkward. Maybe I’ll get a side job at a café or a Lululemon shop. Just for the practice.
Back in Paris, at bustling, understaffed restaurants, harried servers move quickly and efficiently. They don’t smile. They acknowledge me just long enough to indicate, yes, take any available seat. Maybe I’ll get a menu soon, maybe not.
But I always get a tonally cheerful “Bonjour!” paired with firm, if fleeting, eye contact.
The Middle Eastern immigrants working the kebab stalls greet me with a lilting “Bonjour!” The Chinese housekeeping staff at my hotel: “Bonjour!” Service workers who don’t even seem happy with their jobs, at least at that moment: “Bonjour!”
It’s as if those weary service workers are saying, “I’m unhappy right now, but I’m not taking it out on strangers. And so, I will sing because singing is good for my soul. Even if it’s just two notes.”
And if singing one’s troubles is good for one’s soul, does that mean complaining in French is more therapeutic than complaining in English? I’ve heard people complain in French many times, and it’s the cutest thing ever. I feel cathartic just listening to them, and I don’t even know what they’re saying most of the time!
French certainly sounds better than the flatter tones of my American English. In my home country, I hear the French language’s relative musicality exert its influence.
Does it sound more meaningful to say you’re a “hustler” or an “entrepreneur”? (Bonus: Say “entrepreneur” in proper French, with a crooked half-smile and a gleam in your eye for a self-effacing, satirical effect.)
What feels better to say after you emotionally process a major setback? “That’s life!” versus “C’est la vie!”
If you and your partner want to invite a prospective new lover to your bedroom, would you coquettishly propose a “threesome” or a “ménage à trois”?
I’m not an enraptured newbie à la Emily in Paris. This is my seventh time in Paris. I’ve been to other parts of France. I’m actually a sometimes-jaded traveler. I’ve studied French on and off for years.
While I’ve always loved French culture and people, after all these visits, I’m finally noticing and loving the soulful quality I hear in the French language.
That’s all I have about French greetings. Though, we haven’t discussed French farewells, which I find similarly lyrical. I guess you’ll just have to use your imagination when I say (sing):
Au revoir! Bonne journée!
As mentioned, all photos in this article were shot inside this café:
La Crémaillère 1900 (Yelp, Google Maps)

Artful storytelling helping inspire women to learn and grow

I love the “City of Stars” music from the recent Oscar-nominated movie, La La Land. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling tenderly whisper their dreams and hopes to the stars, praying for a city of lights filled with love and happiness.
When I hear this song my heart escapes to a magical place where my dreams are admittedly sentimental and gooey. For me, my city of lights shines brightly in Paris.
Every time I’m in Paris I succumb to its winding streets and famous arrondissements. While I have yet to go beyond the city, venturing into Versailles and Fontainebleau, who can blame me? Paris if filled with an endless selection of bottomless bread baskets, silky cheeses and overflowing red wine on almost every Parisian corner. These culinary delights stimulate my blissful escape into the fascinating world of Parisian stories, stretching my imagination across time and well beyond the city’s center at Notre Dame.
Historical French women call out to me like Joan of Arc, from her gable perch on the Sacré Cœur Basilica, and Josephine Bonaparte, as I walk the cobblestone streets in front of Notre Dame. Paris is alive thousands of monuments to women, whose contributions have changed history and opportunities for other women.
In Montmartre, fifteenth century Joan of Arc is one of my favorite musings. She sits to the left of a triumphant King Louis IX. Joan is best remembered for her role in preserving France’s religious faith and national unity. During the Hundred Years War when the English occupied parts of France and threatened its sovereignty, Joan claimed to hear God’s voice telling her to lead the embattled crown prince Charles VII to victory at Orléans.
Joan of Arc’s victorious charge and horrific death as a heretic burned at the stake sealed her fate as one of France’s most cherished saints. But what if Joan had ignored her dreams or had been too afraid to take up the sword, especially since women leading in war front was unheard of at this time?
Joan’s mystic legacy as a great leader and savior of the church is honored in thousands of statues throughout Paris, and to this day she continues to be a subject of great scholarly fascination.
More personally, the golden image of Joan riding on a horse into battle inspires me to feel like anything is possible in life, if you stay true to your beliefs and convictions amidst doubt and controversy.
Of all the fascinating French women of Paris, I could not write their stories without including the most famous one living in the Louvre museum.
Before you say the Mona Lisa shouldn’t be included because she isn’t technically French born, and is only an Italian subject of painter Leonardo Da Vinci’s, hear me out.
I include the Mona Lisa among the most inspiring and transformative French women for two reasons: her portrait was commissioned by the King of France in 1530 and, most importantly, she is the most visited, studied, and best known work of art in the world whose place in Paris is solidified. Essentially, there are no plans for the Mona Lisa to emigrate anytime soon.
Her resting place in the Louvre is an interesting one, after her picture first hung in the gallery of King Francois I at Fontainebleau. Napoleon Bonaparte moved her to his bedroom wall in his Tuileries apartment in 1800 before she took official residence in the Louvre four years later. The Mona Lisa has continued to live in Paris well over 200 years now, and my fixation with her place there is shared with the world.
No doubt her mysterious smile or what the Italians call, sfumato (meaning blurry, ambitious and up to the imagination) is a perfect reflection of the mysterious allure that French women exude. It is an allure that can’t be defined, any more than Nat King Cole tried in his hit song about Mona Lisa’s smile or Columbia Pictures’ attempt to classify her in the 2003 movie, Mona Lisa Smile.
The potential for women to reach new heights and to dream beyond traditional roles is enough to hold me captive. Mona Lisa reminds us of the power of the imagination, even for any doubters who know that Da Vinci predicted many future inventions from flying machines to water inventions.
Mona Lisa is more than a 16th century painting of Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo. Her stature goes far beyond the millions of people who have flocked to see her. She embodies that powerful combination of strength, mystery, creativity and individualism in French women that inspires me to be even more than I already am.
French history is filled with further examples of complex female figures, the last which must be included to understand revolutionary France. During the French Reign of Terror in 1793, Josephine Tascher de La Pagerie was married to a prominent Viscount named Alexandre de Beauharnais. Alexandre was executed by guillotine for being an aristocratic sympathizer but his wife Josephine was saved from the same fate thanks to her quick intellect.
Parisian women still recount Josephine’s ingenious escape. Josephine walked up the steps of the platform to meet her death but fainted in front of a huge crowd gathered at Notre Dame. Claiming she was with child, she knew the Catholic laws protected the execution of an innocent child so her life would be spared. Able to wait out the political unrest in jail Josephine was released when the final coup d’état ended.
Josephine would reappear on these same steps of Notre Dame to be crowned Empress years later when she married Napoleon Bonaparte. After her prison release she became a popular leader in Paris society and caught the fancy of Napoleon, a young rising officer in the army. She used her position to advance his political fortune, and when they married in a civil ceremony Josephine insisted on a second ceremony at Notre Dame after his coronation as Emperor on December 1, 1804.
During their reign, Josephine fought for social and political reforms and joined a movement of women called the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, whose demands included equal rights for women and economic reforms in Paris. Participating in a march that included over seven thousand armed women, Josephine took to the streets and protested at the Hotel de Ville and later Versailles.
Josephine secured her title as Empress with Napoleon even after he divorced her because she could not produce an heir. Despite her new status, she remained politically astute and helped assuage the marriage of her daughter, Hortense, to Napoleon’s brother Louis, and her son Eugene’s marriage to the daughter of the King of Bavaria.
When you consider Josephine’s historical legacy, her ancestry of five dynasties still reigns in Northern Europe, in the ruling families of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, and in Luxembourg. In fact, she is even connected to Princess Diana and her son William, who will become the next King of England. How’s that for a city of lights and an Empress of all Empires?
Parisian women have changed the course of history in France and throughout the world. The new reign of terror attacks are not enough to dampen my appetite for Paris, as I stand in solidarity with them. The French commitment to helping America in its struggle for independence lives on in our Lady Liberty statue, a gift from the French designed by Auguste Bartholdi.
As she clutches the Declaration of Independence and steps out of the British chains that lay at her feet, I know France will always have a special place in my heart. This power is underscored by its women and captured in a diary entry by Napoleon to his future wife, Josephine. In it, he writes to her saying,
“I awake filled with you. Your portrait and yesterday’s intoxicating evening left no repose for my senses. Gentle, incomparable Josephine, what a strange effect you have on my heart!”

“When you make a decision as a mayor, you immediately see positive and negative effects.” says Ms Anne Hidalgo, Mayor Paris
Since becoming the first female Mayor of Paris in 2014, Anne Hidalgo has championed an ambitious vision to make the French capital a global leader in sustainability and urban environmental innovation. Her policies, rooted in combating climate change and enhancing the quality of life for Parisians, have reshaped the city’s landscape, reduced its ecological footprint, and set a benchmark for cities worldwide. Hidalgo’s work reflects a commitment to nature, social equity, and a forward-thinking approach to urban living, earning her international acclaim, including a spot on TIME’s 2024 TIME100 Climate list. This article explores her transformative efforts to foster a greener Paris and secure a better future for its residents.
A Vision for a Greener Paris
Hidalgo’s tenure has been defined by bold environmental policies aimed at reducing pollution, prioritizing sustainable mobility, and reintegrating nature into urban spaces. Her overarching goal is to make Paris a “15-minute city,” where essential services—shops, schools, workplaces, and green spaces—are accessible within a short walk or bike ride. This concept, championed by Hidalgo and urban planner Carlos Moreno, seeks to reduce car dependency, enhance community living, and mitigate climate impacts.
Her initiatives reflect a holistic approach to urban planning, balancing ecological resilience with social inclusion.
Revolutionizing Urban Mobility
One of Hidalgo’s most transformative achievements has been her push to reduce car dominance in Paris, a city historically shaped by automotive culture. Since 2014, her administration has added over 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) of bike lanes, making cycling a viable and safe option for commuters. The “Plan Vélo” initiative has expanded cycling infrastructure, with dedicated lanes and bike-sharing schemes like Vélib’ becoming integral to Parisian life. Posts on X highlight the scale of this transformation, noting that Paris has built “+800km new bike paths” and reduced car traffic by 40% under Hidalgo’s leadership.
Hidalgo has also pedestrianized key areas, transforming the Seine riverbanks into car-free zones reserved for walkers and cyclists. The “Paris Respire” (Paris Breathes) initiative bans traffic in certain areas on Sundays and holidays, encouraging residents to reclaim public spaces. Major roads, including stretches along the Seine and iconic plazas like Bastille and Nation, have been redesigned to prioritize pedestrians and public transport. These efforts have led to a 40% drop in air pollution since 2014, significantly improving environmental health.
To further deter car use, Hidalgo introduced policies targeting high-polluting vehicles. Diesel vehicles have been banned from Paris by 2024, with all fossil fuel vehicles phased out by 2030. A parking tax on gas-guzzling SUVs and mandatory emissions stickers for cars entering the city reinforces these measures. These policies not only reduce emissions but also incentivize cleaner transport alternatives, aligning with Paris’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.
Greening the Urban Landscape
Hidalgo’s commitment to nature is evident in her ambitious tree-planting and urban greening programs. Since taking office, Paris has planted over 200,000 trees, with a pledge to add 170,000 more by 2026. Urban forests are being created near landmarks like the Hôtel de Ville, Gare de Lyon, and Opéra Garnier, with plans to cover 50% of the city with planted areas by 2030. A notable project is the transformation of the area from the Trocadéro to the Eiffel Tower into a 56-hectares wooded park, set to become a “green lung” for the city.
In 2022, Hidalgo announced plans for a 3.5-hectare urban forest in the 20th arrondissement, planting over 2,000 trees to combat heatwaves and enhance biodiversity. Her administration has also relaxed building codes to encourage residents to plant trees in their neighborhoods, fostering community-driven greening. These efforts address urban heat island effects, with Paris preparing for projected heatwaves exceeding 50°C (120°F) in coming decades.
Hidalgo’s vision extends to iconic landmarks. The Champs-Élysées, one of the world’s most famous avenues, is being reimagined as a “fantastic garden” by 2030, with wider sidewalks, more trees, and reduced car lanes. These projects not only enhance Paris’s aesthetic appeal but also improve air quality and urban resilience.
Making the Seine Swimmable
A hallmark of Hidalgo’s environmental legacy is her commitment to cleaning the Seine River, a symbolic and practical endeavor. Decades of pollution rendered the Seine unsafe for swimming, but Hidalgo promised to make it swimmable by the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Her administration invested heavily in wastewater treatment and stormwater management, resulting in a cleaner river. In July 2024, Hidalgo herself swam in the Seine to demonstrate its safety, a highly publicized moment that underscores her commitment to environmental progress.
The Olympics provided a platform to showcase sustainable urban practices. Temporary venues minimized new construction, single-use plastics were restricted, and equipment was redistributed for reuse. These efforts halved emissions compared to the 2012 London Olympics, aligning with Paris’s carbon-neutral ambitions.
Global Leadership in Climate Action
Hidalgo’s influence extends beyond Paris through her roles in global climate networks. As chair of C40 Cities from 2016 to 2019, she advocated for urban climate leadership, emphasizing the role of cities in meeting Paris Agreement goals. In 2023, she was appointed a Global Ambassador for the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy, where she pushes for city-level climate financing and ambitious emissions targets. Her work with figures like Michael Bloomberg and other mayors has fostered international collaboration on green policies.
Hidalgo’s leadership during the 2015 COP21 summit, where the Paris Agreement was adopted, cemented her reputation as a climate advocate. She co-hosted the Climate Summit for Local Leaders, empowering cities to set bold emissions targets. Her global advocacy underscores her belief that local actions drive systemic change, a principle reflected in Paris’s recognition with a UN Climate Action Award at COP26.
Visionary Leader
Ms Hidalgo argues that her policies, though polarizing, are necessary to address the climate crisis, a stance echoed by supporters like the former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who called her a “visionary leader.”
A Legacy for the Future
Her decade-long tenure has left an indelible mark on Paris, transforming it into a model of sustainable urban living. From reducing emissions by 25% between 2004 and 2018 to creating 45 kilometers of new parks and 180 car-free “school streets,” Hidalgo’s policies have prioritised nature and human-centric urban design.
Her work has inspired cities globally, proving that bold local action can address planetary challenges. As Paris prepares for a future of climate resilience, Hidalgo’s legacy—bike-filled streets, verdant parks, and a swimmable Seine—stands as a testament to her unwavering commitment to nature and a better future. In her words, “We have to dare, because tomorrow it will be too late.
Regards and a respectful salute to this great Climate Leader and Citizen Of Mother Earth, Ms Anne Hidalgo. It is because of the climate action by world citizens and leaders like you, life on Earth is safe for all living beings.

Before I moved to France, I used to think that French people were arrogant about their food.
Now that I’ve lived here for almost four years, I ‘now’ think that French people are very arrogant about their food.
It’s not that people here aren’t open to other cuisines. Heck, they seem to rate Italian and Japanese food pretty highly.
And it’s not that people from other countries don’t hold supremacist views of their own — at least as far as food is concerned.
But when it comes to questions about culinary sophistication, French people, by and large, take it as self-evident that French food is in a league of its own.
In a country where everything is subject to debate, questions as to French food’s superiority remain, ironically, off the table.
I’m painting in broad strokes, of course; not everyone thinks this way. But given how many times I’ve been privy to French people talking merde about other cuisines, I feel pretty confident about making this claim.
Make no mistake — I love France and the French people. It’s just that French arrogance about food is a tad annoying.

Since learning that the Louvre is undoubtedly the biggest art museum in the world, I have always been keen to visit this famous sight. My partner and I are both artists, and he wanted to see the Louvre, too. The only problem was that neither of us had any desire to visit Paris, and in fact, we were both a bit intimidated by it.
I can’t say exactly why this was. Maybe it was purely the fact that Paris is the most visited city in the world, and we tend to try to stay away from tourist traps as much as possible. Maybe it was because we heard that Parisians hate foreigners who don’t speak French.
It also might be because we heard that Paris is one of the pickpocket capitals of the world. And, oh yeah, we had heard that people were rude and unwelcoming.
Whatever the reasons were, they are long lost in my memory now because I can firmly say that Paris was not one of the stereotypes we had heard, and both of us were pleasantly surprised by the city and its residents.
I’ve said it before, and I will say it again: traveling to a place and experiencing it yourself is the only way to truly understand it. Trying to decide if…

A few years ago, sometime in late 2022, I moved to France. Paris, to be exact.
I had just been accepted into the American University of Paris. The pandemic was winding down finally, the world was opening up and I decided that I wanted to take a leap of faith and move abroad for a few years.
Like a lot of young Americans, I was deeply convinced that life in Europe — France, to be exact — was going to be a better experience for me than back home. Looking back now I can see my naïvety from a mile away but, to be fair, I had been raised on years of positive, effusive press which often overlooks the dark side of living in Europe, the less-than-ideal reality of France, and my own family members’ longing(s) to escape the United States.
My first year or so in Paris were great, and fun. It was admittedly nice to be outside my comfort zone, in a place I wasn’t really all that familiar with, in a city I had only ever vacationed in. But as I began to “settle” into the city, I felt this lingering sense of discomfort start crawling over me. My first Parisian apartment, in the 7th, so close to the Eiffel Tower I could practically see it from my window, started to feel like an isolating prison. I felt frustrated, depressed, and mind-numbingly bored, but I wasn’t entirely sure if it was just stress from my studies or something else coming up to the surface. I think in many ways I was afraid to acknowledge the truth.
Then my mother died unexpectedly from cancer in the spring of 2024 and my life changed overnight. Home in the States for a few months dealing with her affairs, I had a lot of time to think about my life so far and whether or not I was truly following the right path.
The answer to that was a very resounding NO.
So, I made the painful but necessary decision to move back home, back to the United States, back where I really belong.
France was an okay experience, but it was not really all that people crack it up to be. There was only so much of France and Europe I think one can take before you eventually want to melt into a puddle, cease existing. I tried so hard to “fit into” a culture that would never accept me, never see me for who I really was, that inevitably I was beginning to crack and fall apart. And I tried, very hard, even after my mom died to make it work, but one day I woke up and realized I couldn’t do it anymore. I had to leave, go home, and put my life back together correctly.
Paris is beautiful, yes, but its beauty is, I came to realize, a kind of stifling and suffocating, pretentious, superficiality. When you first move here, it’s glorious to see old Haussmanian apartments towering above you, all in various shades of black and gray, especially when coming from American suburbia. But eventually, you start to notice the decay and depressive energy emanating from these blocks of grubby cement and stone — you see greenish mildew oozing from cracks in buildings, French doors moldering in the corners, rust chewing away at the fancy black banisters. Walking along the wide boulevards is both a dream and a nightmare, because the moment you turn down a corner you inevitably spend the majority of your time hopscotching over poopy pies (most canine but not all), puddles of fresh stinking ochre urine, and other nasty icky things like discarded underwear and who knows what else.
The food here eventually began to drive me crazy. Repetitive, bland, and boring, I began to crave, desperately, a plate of sizzling hot Thai stir fry with basil and chilis and onions and garlic. Or a delicious juicy burger with beef that tastes sweetly of grass and sunshine and not sweat and ammonia, melting in your mouth as opposed to becoming a chewy, grainy mess between your teeth. I missed the variety of produce and snacks at my local Albertsons grocery store, apples like jewels and luscious greens just beckoning to be chopped into stew, being able to make pretty much any dish I could possible think of without having to run around half of Paris to find a tiny bit of garam masala. And don’t even get me started on things like pickles. What do the French have against salty, crunchy, vinegary pickles? I hate those little petite cornichons with their mushy texture and sickly sweet aroma. Of course I could make them, as my grandmother showed me how well enough, but in my middling Parisian kitchen, it was hard to find space to fit a jar of cucumbers, mellowing away in their salted brine, amongst all the other shit I inevitably accumulated. It’s not a crime to want for convenience or simplicity; sometimes, all I wanted was to come home after a long day of classes, papers, and exams to a simple and delicious meal without feeling like I was trapped between McDonald’s and pasta in my choices.
And every time I left Paris for more than a month, I would come back feeling as though the city somehow became a little worse off than before. A little poorer, darker, more negative, less appealing. I think Parisians would like to imagine themselves a living in a bustling metropolis, à la New York, which I find laughable having recently been in NYC myself. Paris is nothing like New York, or London, or even Tokyo or Shanghai or Los Angeles. Even fucking Toronto is more interesting than Paris.
Paris is, at best, a glorified village — it has all the feelings of one, too. Twee and pretentious and conservative in all the wrong ways, clinging to traditions that no one cares about, turning its nose up at innovation and change as though its a crime to experiment and be creative. I found it ironic that in New York, I felt as though I could breathe. Not necessarily because the air was better, but simply because I felt like I could just be myself. No stares as I went about my day alone as apparently, being a single woman without a man or a friend in tow is somehow scandalous (who knew). No funny looks when wearing something other than the usual scarf + nappy old coat combo (the horror). Not having to glower at people over my shoulder as they clip my heels walking at super-sonic speeds down narrow and uneven streets, all to inevitably turn into a smoke shop or some coffeehouse to stand around and do nothing. Not feeling as though I need to explain, or justify my existence to anyone, or anything.
Plus, I’ve had some pretty hair-raising experiences in regards to crime and general grubby, scummy behavior that have made simple things like getting a taxi or even walking down the street more anxiety inducing than I think they need be. Of course we should always practice vigilance wherever we go, but I think when it gets to point you always feel a kind of simmering nervousness about innocent people walking behind you or second-guessing whether or not your taxi driver might pull a fast one on you, something is obviously wrong. Tourists and locals laugh off the crime (and its increase) as though it was funny and quirky but deep down, again, everyone knows it’s not a good sign. Not just now but of the state of things to come.
I haven’t even touched on the racism, the prejudices you inevitably run into, the rampant xenophobia, particularly towards Americans, which begins to weigh on your psyche. As expats/immigrants, we’re given a litany of things (literally! my university would often send lists out) we can’t do in Paris, or else. You try your very best to “fit in” and assimilate, but eventually it gets to the point where you’re just dimming your light to satisfy someone else’s mediocrity, and it actually made me angry a little. Why does everyone need to conform, go along with the crowd, not stand out, not be an individual? Have an opinion that isn’t like Jacques or Emilie’s, which also happens to be the same opinion of nearly every other person you meet? Why is it a crime to smile widely, laugh heartily, or feel passionately? I am not interested in living life in muted sepia tones all day every day, sorry! And trying to make connections with other expats was a nightmare in and of itself: I could never accept the habitual mistreatment, backhanded comments, two faced behavior, cattiness, and other bull that many American expats often put up with just to be accepted by Parisians and, in general, the French and many other Europeans. After about the second time of some random nobody making incredibly offensive and often racist personal digs at me, my intelligence, or my appearance, I had to call it quits.
I could go on, but the gist of things is…I eventually came to appreciate America more than I did when I first left. I missed all the wonderful things about this country we take for granted — our humor, our food, our culture, our nature, everything. I missed the deep, deep blue skies of California, the diversity of cities like New York and Los Angeles, the beauty of states such as Wyoming or Montana. I missed the smell of the desert and the sea mingling in the air in downtown LA, the sweet humid perfume of the bayou in deep country Louisiana where my relatives live. I even missed our shitty politicians, our goofiness, our earnestness. I missed it all, so, so much, in a way that it was almost like a hunger. I longed for all those experiences, the history, and my connection it. I realized I was fine with being “American”, and all the good and bad connotations that come along with it. I don’t have time or the energy anymore after my mom’s death to care so much about putting on airs or trying to pretend to be something I am not. Take it or leave it, it’s who I am and will always be.
Of course it took me running away for a while to see it again.

First of all, before somebody complains, yes, France is not Paris. I am writing this as somebody who spends his time in Paris which is currently my equivalent to France.
After one week spent at the home of a friend in Chatou I moved out to have more chances discovering Paris and specifically Paris in the evening and taking care for myself. Frankly spoken, the second week (or first week after leaving my friend’s home), I spent at a hotel (Hipotel Paris Gambetta République, 20. Arr., 236 Rue des Pyrénées, 75020 Paris), so there’s not much about caring for yourself with cooking, cleaning and co.
The hotel I booked wasn’t luxurious nor exclusive. But it was charming and so was the neighborhood. And it gave me a first glimpse of what life is like there. The Rue des Pyrénées in the 20th Arrondissement is a nice street. Crowded, vibrant, and welcoming. When I left the hotel, everything you need to live was available in a radius of a five-minute walk.
In the area I had four supermarkets (supermarché like Carrefour City, Franprix, U Express, Picard for frozen products and other, smaller ones), bars and restaurants, stores (magasins) for e.g. fruits and vegetables, bakeries (boulangeries), butchers (boucheries), laundries (laveries), post offices, police, hospital, an elementary school (ecole) and so on.
My hotel provided a water heater for tee (and probably soups). So, without a kitchen, I used to go out dining. This, you can imagine, is not always cheap. But it was a way to discover different cuisines if it was halal.
Among others I visited an Indian restaurant, Sohna Punjab. It has been the first time I ever visited an Indian restaurant and I don’t regret it. I like spicy food and Sohna Punjab had spicy food. It was tasty and filling. Other restaurants I visited were a Turkish pizzeria and a Turkish diner across the street. Many Turkish restaurants, right? Right. I enjoy Turkish food.
Of course I didn’t just eat. I used to walk around to discover Paris. And I wasn’t looking for main attractions, but for the city itself. During my first week in Chatou, I saw the suburbs of what I would say was the middle-class or upper middle-class. Now it was about Paris itself. I most of the time walked in the 20th, 19th, 10th and 12th arrondissement.
Of course, I did it partly with my bicycle, even though I didn’t ride as often as I planned. This, I hope, is about to change.
Did I go shopping? Did I spend money on souvenirs? No, I didn’t. Apart from the fact that for future travel I don’t need more weight in my luggage, I had no interest in getting more plastics or decoration to stuff my future home. What I’ve bought was a magnet for my cousin. She loves magnets and so I got her one when I — you guessed right — discovered Paris and — right again — went to a restaurant (right, Turkish).
You can walk miles and miles in Paris. You surely don’t have to. Paris offers a lot of busses, trains and subways (Metro). But I barely use them if there’s no need to. I prefer walking, with my rucksack (sac a dos) on my back. Or, of course, with my bicycle. As I have already said, I didn’t spend as much time on riding, so I only rode the bike from Chatou to the 20th Arrondissement and then, later, I cruised a bit more than 11 kilometers in the 20ths.
And this is not all. Before moving to the new apartment, I used to visit Montmartre. Montmartre is a neighborhood in the 18th arrondissement, in the shadow of the church Sacre Coeur. I went there by using my feet. This is why I walked through areas surrounding the Garre de Nord. In some guides people say these areas were the most dangerous ones in Paris. When I’ve been walking in these areas, I didn’t feel threatened, but I realized that it was dirtier, poorer. It was the Paris you don’t see often in travel reports.
The contrast between the tourist hotspot Sacre Coeur and Montmartre (which lost the charm of an artist neighborhood to an overpriced tourism hotspot) couldn’t be wider. Souvenir shops, all selling the same stuff, and diners and restaurants selling over-sugared food, are welcoming tourists looking for a nice snapshot of Paris. I don’t blame the tourists, but the attractiveness of the city, I assume, is changing the identity of a city to please them with food (yes, I ate Turkish often, you’re right) which makes you feel that the city turns into a funfair. Despite that, I like Paris. And this is the reason, why I extended my stay in the city.
If you want to read more about my stay in Paris, visit my profile again. More posts are being published in the future. In the next article I will talk about living in the 17th Arrondissement, the Champs-Elysees, the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower at night.

After planning the trip for over a year, we were finally here. Our bags having been dropped off at the hotel, my wife, Sarah, and I were on a walk through Les Marais in Paris. Yes, that’s Paris, France. I had to remind myself a couple of times on this first walk just to be sure.
Then we turned a corner and the Seine itself coursed away in front of us. Notre Dame stretched to the sky and its glory was somehow undimmed by the scaffolding that has adorned it since the fateful fire in 2019. Then finally, after walking a few miles, grabbing dinner, and taking an Uber when our legs wouldn’t carry us one step further, we saw the Eiffel Tower. We were here.
That split second of traveler euphoria was quickly squelched as — no more than a minute after we had stepped out of the Uber — the rain started. It was slow at first. Sun was even breaking through and splashing over the famous curved iron. But then the rains really came.
We tried to hail an Uber, but none were available — probably because we were now part of a growing throng of people huddled underneath the measly branches of landscaped trees near the queue for the Tower. We looked at each other through rain-soaked eyelashes; our clothes were drenched.

I was 32 years old when I got the email that brought me to France. By then the course of my life looked pretty much circumscribed. Like many English people I spoke no foreign languages, and there was little to indicate that I would one day live abroad, apart from a taste for subtitled films, croissants and novels in translation.
Weekday mornings I took the Tube to my mildly enjoyable job at an advertising trade magazine, picking up a copy of The Times to read along the way. At weekends I ate pub lunches and ambled in the park and spent hours buried in the Sunday papers, just like everyone else. True, I travelled quite a bit — but nobody asked me to stay.
Then it came, out of the blue. A mail from somebody called François. I wish I’d kept it — but no. Still, the essence of it was: “We’re launching an English-language magazine in Paris and we’re looking for an editor. Your name has come up. Interested?”
Long story short, I moved to Paris.
I arrived on the day before my birthday, so the date is easy to remember. Today, the day I’m writing this post, marks my 20th year here. And I can tell you, it’s gone by in a flash. Yet so much has happened: love, marriage, a son, changes of address and changes of fortune.
But that’s not why you’re here. What you want to know is: how does living abroad for so long change you as a person?
In essence, I think, you keep the best of your homeland and jettison the rest. And you’re also free to adopt the most appealing aspects of your new home and pretty much ignore everything else.
Becoming Franglais
Let’s start with England. I kept the sense of humour — that was a given. I also retain an old-fashioned sense of courtesy. I’m chatty yet respectful with waiters, taxi drivers, store security guards, shop assistants…everyone, in fact. My (French) wife often remarks on how polite I am on public transport — not a very Parisian characteristic. My colleagues tell me I’m “a gentleman”. But this comes with a wariness of causing offence that can prevent me from speaking my mind — something my wife feels is tantamount to hypocrisy. “Is that your real answer?” she’ll say, after asking my opinion. “Or your English answer?”
I kept a whole roster of English-language films and books and poems that remain dear to me. And I still don’t mind the rain.
I lost my patriotism. I was never xenophobic, but learning another language has definitely made me more open. I recall stating quite often that London was the greatest city in the world, but I’ve revised that opinion. We all know where the “Britain is best” attitude led. Living in France has enabled me to understand the cultural jigsaw puzzle of Europe and see Britain’s place in it. When that piece went missing, I was appalled.
Yet at the same time, I wasn’t entirely surprised. There is a yobbish, jingoistic subculture in the UK that has always scared and disgusted me. Those groups of drunken young men stumbling around town on Saturday nights. I was delighted to leave them behind. Along with football. “Soccer”, if you prefer. The first conversational gambit of almost every British male. No, I don’t support a team. No, I didn’t see the match. And no, I’m really not interested in talking about it.
Food, now that’s interesting. It doesn’t take a French person long to get onto the subject — and I’ve become like them. I can hold my own on the wine front, too. In fact I’ve become addicted to bistros and brasseries, and a basket of bread with every meal.
But there’s also a particular sort of family meal here. It’s long and garrulous, with many courses and lots of debate, some of it heated. After my first dinner with my now-wife’s family, I asked her in amazement: “Do you always speak to your parents like that?”
Living in France has taught me a different way of being a family member. Be close. Be present. Show affection. We have dinner with Géraldine’s parents every Saturday — something I would never have imagined doing with my own parents, still less my partner’s.
Joie de vivre, actually
I’ve developed a different relationship to work and money. Back in London, people worked hard. They arrived at work early, they grafted, their lunch was often a sandwich at their desk. I respected them for that. Living in London is expensive, and you have to earn your keep. You can always de-stress in the pub at night.
In Paris it’s different. It irritated me at first. In my neighbourhood I’d try to go to the bank and the dry cleaner at lunchtime — and they were shut. The sandwiches on sale in supermarkets and even boulangeries were surprisingly bland: there’s only so much ham and cheese you can eat. The restaurants and the café terraces, on the other hand, were packed. What was it with these people? Didn’t they have work to do?
Yes, they did. But they also had lives to live. Friends to see. Small pleasures to enjoy. In general — and I’ve just checked this with my wife — French people are suspicious of the rich and bemused by workaholics. They are not lazy. But they don’t put work and money at the centre of their lives. One day, I got that. So instead of complaining, I decided to try their approach. The next day I was sitting on a café terrace at lunchtime, eating fillet of salmon with ratatouille and sipping a glass of rosé. I returned to work happy and motivated. I’m sorry, but the French have totally won lunchtime.
Emotionally, as well, I’ve become a little more French. I’m less afraid to show sadness, or anger — or even, indeed, fear. I’m no longer convinced that a stiff upper lip is the best expression to adopt.
I’ve also come to understand the concept of loyalty, which felt somewhat abstract back home. French people don’t have the easy familiarity of Americans, or the chirpy amiability of Brits, but once they decide that you’re a friend, they’re in it for life. Restaurants here work in a similar way, oddly enough. You know that waiter you considered aloof and cold? Go back the next night. Then the night after that. He’ll soon warm up. There are restaurants in Paris where I’m practically welcomed with open arms. Because I showed loyalty.
Paris, of course, is all about style. My wife thinks my personal style comes from England, as it leans heavily into tweed jackets or blazers, shirts with cufflinks and well-polished brogues. But the truth is that being an Englishman in Paris has accentuated that style. Paris gave me the urge to dress up — England gave me the building blocks. Plus in summer I love a stripy mariner’s T-shirt, which is totally français.
Talking of birthdays, there’s one thing I do that my wife tells me is very English. I send cards. Birthday, Christmas, Valentine’s…you name it. I take pride in selecting the prettiest ones. But they’re not so easy to find here, so I stock up when I’m in London.
Perhaps, in the end, that’s why I chose to settle in Paris. Culturally, it’s very different to the UK. But it’s also only a two and a half hours away by Eurostar. I really can have the best of both worlds.

In 2009, I left North America for the first time, to visit a place I had longed to see my whole life: Paris. Unlike most people I know, I didn’t imagine walking the streets wearing a beret with a baguette tucked beneath my arm. I didn’t care about visiting the pâtisseries or buying expensive, designer clothing. I wasn’t particularly interested in the museums, either.
There was one thing there that I had to see, above all else: Notre-Dame.
I can’t really explain this. I could give you a million reasons, though none fully illuminate this deep connection I have to a building I had never seen before.
For instance, I love its architecture. The flying buttresses are so beautiful, just looking at them makes my chest hurt. Then there are the gargoyles, so fiery and pagan, a strange juxtaposition to such a dignified edifice of the Catholic tradition. Then there are the rib vaults of the nave, the elegant spire, the gallery of the kings on the west façade, and of course, the beatific rose window. Its grandeur is so overwhelming to me, this building that has been standing for 857 years.

If Paris is the City of Light, it’s also the city of dog poop.
Anywhere you go, on any street, in any quarter, you’ll be greeted by the familiar sight of a dog’s breakfast. Or at least what remains of it.
Make no mistake: Paris is a fecal minefield. And it always has been.
In a city known for its refinement, you could argue that the dog poop here is made to perfection — so much so that canine excrement from other cities is a distant no. 2.
Because here, every dog poop is the product of hours of French savoir-faire in the art of dégustation, digestion and excretion — a celebration of craft that brings the community together. After all, the best way to give a merde about society is by leaving one behind.
So to celebrate Parisian solidarity, I thought it would be interesting to document the sheer variety of dog poop in Paris, before these most humble of creations go the way of the dinosaurs.
It’s a truism that dogs are allowed to poop next to trees. At least then, people can avoid tarnishing their soles with a stranger’s gift. But what happens when this gift isn’t gifted in the streets’ litter…

What Parisians can teach us about shaking up our morning routine.
“If you think adventure is dangerous, try routine; it is lethal.” — Paulo Coelho
Once upon a time, I was sitting inside a bar in the East Village of Manhattan with some NYU friends for happy hour. It was a rare occasion that we exited Bobst Library in time for after-work specials. Our conversation was in full swing, high-antioxidant wine was flowing, and of course, some bites graced the table. I cannot pinpoint the exact topic of the conversation, but I will forever remember the statement my fellow peer and dear friend made to this day — “Sometimes I feel like I am stuck between wanting a structured life and wanting to be a Bohemian.”
It was like time slowed down, the music blurred, the camera did that thing where it spins around you catching every angle of your body and intensifying your emotions. That’s it! That’s exactly how I feel! I thought to myself. On second thought, maybe I said it out loud. I carried on with my pumpkin soup and glass of red, and my life was forever changed.
Very nutrition student of you…
Walking the walk, you know.
For the rest of my life, I would continue with some sort of routine, but when it got too strict, too structured, too “routiney,” I would let my Bohemian side come out to play.
I am not here to tell you how Elon, Richard, Serena, or Beyoncé spend their mornings and then proceed to tell you to follow suit. I have said this before, and I will say it again, “what works for one person does not mean it works for everyone,” and other short stories by yours truly.
OK, Kelly so what are you here for then? Hurry up because I only have 8 more minutes to meditate, take a cold shower, and make my bone marrow coffee before I go to work. FML.
I am here to tell you that maybe the best morning routine allows for some wiggle room to shake things up once in a while. I’m not talking about an adrenaline-seeking, risk-taking, edge-of-your-seat, “Vegas, baby!” shaking up. I’m talking about instead of driving to work or taking the train, walking or biking; instead of gulping down drip coffee sipping on a Chai, or instead of meditating followed by journaling, reading a chapter in that book you have had on your nightstand for the past month.
2 months, actually.
I appreciate the honesty.
You have your habits, your rituals, and your overall routine, and you like it, but you cannot handle it when it doesn’t go exactly to plan. Your heart thumps and your nerves move to the edge of your skin wanting an out, how dare someone get sick on the train and make me late for my panda-hugging class! Maybe that morning routine needs a vacation, or maybe it just needs a good cry.
You aren’t talking about my routine anymore, are you…?
You do not need to have a ridged morning routine 7 days a week to be successful. Each day may be different and some people love plans and routines while others do not. Sometimes a morning routine is a product of your personality and sometimes it is a product of your environment, life situation, or culture.
For years I have loved to have some sort of morning routine. It has shifted and changed a bit from time to time. When I moved from NYC to Paris the change in my morning routine was mainly because of the change in my environment, work, and life situation. While NYC and Paris have some similarities (the metro is packed like sardines in both cities), they also have a lot of differences, and one difference that stood out to me was the morning routine of the people of Paris.
Let’s go back to New York first.
“I gotta go schlepp uptown.”
“Can’t gotta work.”
“See you at the gym at 6 AM?”
“I’ll have a quadruple espresso, please.” (I’m not exaggerating; I heard it for myself, Wall Street, 2015).
“I’m getting on this train whether these people think I am or not.” (The train stalls after getting on).
“I think a rat just ran over my foot.”
“Walk faster.”
God, I love New York!
Is this nostalgic for some of you? Above are snippets of New Yorkers’ conversations, either with another person or with themselves. For some of you, moments like these are a distant memory. Now you wake up, roll out of bed, move your computer’s mouse around, and put on the Pivot Podcast while you shower.
My New York mornings were calculated as they involved taking the 6 train from the Upper East Side to Wall Street. I wakeup, caffeine in the form of black coffee or Matcha, brush my teeth, put cold water on my face, exercise, shower, skincare, mascara, under-eye concealer, lipstick, pinch cheeks, and delete those text messages from the night before because “out of sight out of mind,” grab my breakfast to have at work and do an Olympic power walk to the train. Once at work, I would check my emails while eating breakfast. Boom- chakalaka. I was high off “the hustle.”
Once back to work, I fell slightly back into calculating my mornings. It was like riding a bike, once learned and never forgotten. A couple of days a week I taught Pilates at 7 AM. I would wake up giving myself exactly 60 minutes to brush my teeth, wash my face, dab on some tinted face cream and under-eye concealer, chug cold brew, walk to work, and eat breakfast in the bathroom 5 minutes before teaching so I would not pass out from low blood sugar, and by that time the cold brew kicked in the city was the best place on earth. My 7 AM clients got the best of me.
On the other mornings, I worked from home. I still woke up fairly early to get in some morning movement before work. My weekends, both pre and post-pandemic, were quite different, but not drastically different, and I wanted them that way. My weekends were like my adventure not to make my routine lethal. But why did I have to leave all of that up to the weekend?
Let me guess. Society? Culture?
It is quite likely that they tested the workweek waters. I was just thinking out loud.
To summarize and generalize, mornings in New York are:
wake and Drake before 7 AMcover the dark circles under your eyesbrush and rushget coffee and something to eat on the gomiss your train by .7 secondsgrab the next one right behind itsit on the train because of train trafficget off the train|confirm dinner date plans while walking to the officepush the arrow up buttonface your childhood fear of elevatorsthrow all of your worries behind as you enter the office with a smile on your face.
Usually every night I take a walk to the steps of the church of Saint-Etienne-du-Mont. Then at the stroke of midnight, a car full of drunk characters that look like they came from a Great Gatsby party pulled up to whisk me away to a literary joint for champagne and storytelling.
Wow, there must be something in the champagne over there…
Good one. This is not a true event, but can’t we all just take a moment to appreciate Midnight in Paris? Merci Beaucoup.
Now for the real Paris life. No, I did not eat croissants every morning or have a cigarette on the balcony overlooking the Parisian architecture as the sun rose. Although, in honesty, I very easily could have. Paris is filled with the smell of freshly baked bread and pastries (and cigarette smoke), and you do not have to pay a fortune to have a balcony as part of the apartment package.
I still had structure even though my work was far less structured, and I still moved my body in the morning doing some sort of exercise even though Paris is not a culture of morning structured workouts. Take my neighbor Camille for example, she got in her morning movement by biking to work, and in heels (I know this because I could hear it through our old, charming Parisian walls).
My mornings in Paris were much, well slower. I would open the shutters, go out on the balcony (I know New Yorker, keep manifesting, and until then enjoy the fire escape), take a deep breath, use the bathroom, mist my face with Evian water (stop judging, I live in France, remember), prepare coffee (no longer cold brew), and breakfast, conduct a mini skincare routine, move my body and eat breakfast at a real-life table. But this post is not to tell you all about what I did and I do. I am still an American after all. What have I observed about real-life Parisians? Read on.
Let’s paint the picture. Typically the Parisian will wake up early unless they are an artist or such, then whatever, c’est la vie! Coffee is a must, and those who choose tea are not condemned for choosing the other liquid cocaine. Coffee is typically not hyper-caffeinated cold brew, although the hipsters have imported that to town so do not be surprised if you see it on the menu. Classic coffee choices range from café allongé (the French Americano, with less water), café au lait (coffee with milk), cappuccino, or a café latte. At breakfast, and only at breakfast, a traditional French thing to do is to have your morning brew in a mug that is more like a bowl (think big enough to comfortably dip a croissant or piece of baguette into your warm frothy milk coffee). If you have never dipped a croissant or piece of baguette into your cappuccino I highly recommend you give it a try. Dietitian approved.
Food Nerd alert.
Why, thank you.
Commonly at brasseries, they will offer a petit-déjeuner (breakfast) menu of a hot drink (coffee, tea, or hot chocolate), cold drink (typically orange juice), tartine (usually baguette) with butter and jam, or viennoiserie (a pastry such as a croissant or pain au chocolat- a chocolate croissant). At home, the classic petit-déjeuner meal is similar, or other more modern-day options are to have yogurt, some fruit, or cereal. But bread is always a good idea in Paris.
Paris also serves the global masses, and brunch or a wider variety of breakfast foods are offered at some cafes and restaurants for tourists or homesick expats.
One of the places that I loved visiting in Paris was the pharmacy. I know what you are thinking, weirdo, but hear me, or read me, out. The pharmacies here just hit differently. When I first moved to Paris I thought, Ooooh lala look at all of these French brands, SVR Laboratories, Bioderma, and Embryolisse, oh my! Then I remembered, oh yeah, I’m in France, this is just the norm. The morning skincare routine offers more variety for the skin to devour than the French breakfast, but it is just as simple and enjoyable. Customarily speaking, micellar water or cleansing milk is used to cleanse the skin followed by a toner such as rosewater, a dab of eye cream, a serum, and a moisturizer, likely with SPF. Exfoliation products are used, but less often, and are very gentle. Voila.
Parisians are generally not going to get up and hit the gym early in the morning. My schedule for teaching Pilates completely changed when I moved to Paris. No more chug and teach.
I cannot find a yoga class before 11 AM and the only dance class I can find before 10 am is on Saturdays. I’m not saying they don’t exist, but they are not in demand.
What are they doing if they are not hitting the gym? Well, not rushing through their morning coffee or breakfast for one. My husband gets up about 1.5 hours before he leaves for work to sit and drink his coffee, read sports news, eat something small, and take a long shower. I witnessed one gym during my time in Paris, but mostly I see people biking, jogging, or walking outside a lot.
Parisians love to be outside (some people say so they can smoke la cigarette), but they also are more likely to, say, jog outside than jog on a treadmill inside. The same goes for biking. The morning commute is a typical way for Parisians to get in movement and to get outside. Just beware of the bikes.
I am always amazed by the difference in the sun while in different parts of the world. In Dubai, it looks bigger, like it is staring at you in your face, demanding attention. In Paris, it shines later into the night during the Summer months, until about 10:30 PM, and the sunrise shifts as well. I remember waking up at our apartment in November thinking it was probably 5 AM because it was still so dark outside. It was 8 AM.
Paris offers you a view from a different angle of the morning routine. I hope this peek into Parisian life may inspire you to add a petite adventure to your morning routine. You do not have to jump on a plane and arrive here by morning to live a little Parisian. Remember, trains stall here too, so bring a good book with you and bof it off.
I think that often many of us (moi-self included) romanticize Paris. Now that I write this I think Americans romanticize all of Europe in general. You may have heard that saying before “Europeans go to America to work, Americans go to Europe to live.” Perhaps that came from the history of immigration to the US for the “American Dream,” back in the day when people from all over Europe entered the East Coast of America by boat to start a new life and a new business. When they went back home to Europe they could finally relax a little. Whatever the reason may be sometimes it feels good to fantasize about a place far, far away.
Which brings me back to that one night in New York. I had a vision of myself at the intersection between Orderly Avenue and rue de Nonconformist; one of those hallucinations that are so real that if it didn’t happen in real life you are going to make it happen in real life. I have revisited the saying “structured bohemian,” in my mind multiple times since that evening. I relate well to opposites — organized chaos, imperfect symmetry, the sun and the moon, not one or the other. I am the equivalent of both. The same went for a routine. Too much I felt stagnant. Too little I felt unsteady. I craved balance. But balance isn’t frigid. It is room temperature, flowing, swaying, and calm.
French icon Coco Chanel once said, “You were born an original, don’t become a copy !”
I think this is helpful when thinking about a morning routine. There is a difference between being inspired by someone and being influenced by someone. I provide examples of my personal morning routines and that of some Parisians, but the last thing I want is for one to feel pressured into copying another culture or particular person’s routine. The meaning behind this message is to help you notice when you are being too strict with yourself and also to be aware when something calls to you. If you would rather sleep a little more in the morning than wake up and journal, then let sleep be your meditation. If you have more energy in the morning then be inspired by some morning movement.
Finally, allow yourself to change. I can say with absolute assurance my morning routine now is not the same as it was when I was 25 years old. If you are overloading your morning with all the trends from all the cultures and all the people are you honoring your own needs? Your wants? Permit yourself to let your inner Bohemian come out to play.

In ways both small and large, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games is a series of firsts. It will be the first in the history of the Games to include breakdancing (or “breaking”) as a competitive event, and the first to achieve gender parity. Paris 2024 may also achieve the Games’ highest level of sustainability yet by becoming the first to halve its carbon emissions compared to the average of London 2012 and Rio 2016.
The goal has been years in the making, set in motion by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) — the Lausanne, Switzerland–based body that oversees all matters related to the Games and the Olympic Movement at large — and the IOC’s Olympic Agenda 2020, a roadmap that spells out its broader goals. Sustainability is a key pillar of that roadmap. The IOC has committed to reducing its direct and indirect emissions by 50 percent by 2030, when all Olympic Games must also commit to reducing carbon emissions and compensate for more than 100 percent of their residual emissions.
“Paris 2024 is the first edition to fully embrace this ambition of the strategic roadmap,” Marie Sallois, IOC’s director of corporate and sustainable development, told Convene. “From Day One, [Paris 2024] was conceived with sustainability in mind.” In fact, the Paris 2024 Organizing Committee — the body responsible for planning, organizing, financing, and delivering the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris in 2024 — pledged to halve carbon emissions during its bid, in step with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
That goal initiated a complete overhaul of the Games’ sustainability strategy, chiefly switching from a post-Games assessment to setting a pre-Games target and defining a carbon budget early on: less than 1.7 million tons of CO2. This carbon budget is treated much like a financial budget, where “every decision you make about an event, an activation,” Sallois said, “you must take into account how much it costs, how many people will work on it, and how much carbon it emits.”
“That’s a very different approach than the one we took in the past,” she said. Although many editions of the Games had “interesting, innovative solutions in terms of sustainability” — Sallois cited the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, which embraced circularity with recycled Olympic Medals and podiums — for Paris 2024, she said, “sustainability was first and foremost.”
Come July 26, 2024, when the opening ceremony kicks off, spectators and athletes will see this new iteration of the Games come to life, one where nearly every facet of the experience has been revised to lessen its environmental impact. “Some things are incremental, some things are drastic,” Sallois said. But overall, the strategy has been to “look at… the levers that contribute the most to the footprint.”
Of those levers, infrastructure ranks as one of the largest. Already, Paris 2024 has achieved a new benchmark in this category — 95 percent of the venues for the Games will utilize existing or temporary structures, the highest percentage of any previous Olympic Games. That includes historic sites that have been modernized — like Yves-du-Manoir Stadium, which served as the main venue for the eighth Olympiad in 1924 and will host the field hockey competitions for Paris 2024 — and temporary facilities, like an outdoor arena that will host the Olympic and Paralympic equestrian jumping and dressage competitions on the Etoile Royale esplanade at Château de Versailles.
The design of the new Aquatics Centre, the only permanent sports facility built for Paris 2024, meets stringent environmental standards. It has been built primarily with wood rather than concrete or steel, both of which create carbon dioxide in their manufacturing process, and will require less cooling and heating, aided by the rooftop solar array. The Olympic and Paralympic Village also demonstrates how infrastructure for the Games can be built using sustainable construction methods to lower emissions. Stretching into the neighborhoods of Seine-Saint-Denis, Ile Saint-Denis, and Saint-Ouen, the 126-acre site will accommodate 14,500 athletes and their staff during the Olympic Games followed by 9,000 athletes and their staff during the subsequent Paralympic Games. The Village’s carbon footprint is also 30 percent smaller than that of a modern construction project as a result of using wood and recycled materials. The latter, Sallois said, represents how the Village exemplifies “how we want to build for the future,” by not just focusing on lowering carbon emissions, but creating climate-resilient infrastructure.
Powering Paris 2024 infrastructure using renewable energy — like the geothermal-powered Olympic Village — will be a first for the Games, Sallois said, and what she thinks holds significant potential for the events industry at large. “Often in the past, the model for large events — and this is true for events other than sporting events — [is diesel] generators as a primary source of energy,” she said.
Instead, a newly created grid operated by French partner Enedis and EDF will supply Paris 2024 venues with energy produced via off-site wind and solar farms. According to the IOC, it will save 14,000 tons of carbon emissions. And it’s also permanent, helping to further the legacy of Paris 2024 by allowing future events to harness renewable energy, too — an idea that Sallois believes represents “a big shift for the industry of events.”
Solar energy generated on site also is helping to power the event. The Aquatics Centre’s photovoltaic panel-covered roof is intended to supply all of the facility’s energy needs and also will qualify as one of France’s largest urban solar farms. Similar installations will be added to the Olympic Village, the Transport Mall, and even the Seine, where a floating solar power plant with 7,750 square meters will supply energy to the Games and will be repurposed elsewhere later. Even the backup generators — essential in the event of interruptions in energy supply — will run on biofuels.
It helps that Paris is already one of the most walkable cities in the world, which is further bolstered by a robust public transportation system and the fact that many of Paris 2024’s major venues will be centrally located within the city.
“Paris, together with IOC, has completely revisited … transportation operations and the transportation plan to not only use the most efficient transportation means from a sustainability point of view, but also to reduce, in total, the [need for] transportation,” said Panos Tzivanidis, the IOC’s director of corporate events and services.
For Paris 2024, venues have been cherrypicked for their proximity to public transport — even beyond Paris. Lyon, Saint-Etienne, Nice, Bordeaux, Nantes, and Marseille will all serve as Olympic host sites in 2024, with France’s high-speed TGV rail network connecting spectators to those cities and other Olympic sites around France. Within Paris, those spectators will have the Paris metro to rely on, which has expanded routes for the Games, along with nearly 260 miles of bike lanes, including 54 miles of recently added lanes that will create new access points to competition venues. Thousands of extra bikes will be available for spectator use via Vélib, a public bike-sharing program. In addition, Toyota will provide a fleet of electric- and hydrogen-fueled transportation options on hand for athletes, staff, and spectators.
“Paris 2024 is really a turning point in our approach [to legacy] because now it’s really us adapting to the city, and no longer the [city] adapting to us,” Sallois said. That includes ensuring new infrastructure can be purposefully adapted and tailored to the needs of the host destination in the afterlife of the Games — a key goal laid out in the IOC’s Olympic Agenda 2020.
For example, the Aquatics Centre intends to benefit the residents of Seine-Saint-Denis, an area in Northeast Paris. During the Games, the Aquatics Centre will host the artistic swimming, water polo, and diving events but after it will provide a dedicated facility for the community — a huge asset considering that it’s an under-resourced area in terms of infrastructure and that six out of 10 teens in the area do not know how to swim. In addition, the Olympic Village site will provide the local community with more than 2,800 new housing units, two new schools, 14 acres of green space, and a new bridge crossing the Seine that links the Île-Saint-Denis and Saint-Denis neighborhoods, among other infrastructure.
For Paris 2024, legacy also goes beyond infrastructure. Paris 2024 “has a very clear legacy that has been already delivered prior to the Games,” Sallois said. “It means that the legacy is not something that you think about during the Games or after, you plan for it… to be delivered before the Games.” A prime example is Paris 2024’s commitment to motivating the country’s youth to exercise more. According to the National Observatory of Physical Activity (ONAPS), 37 percent of children between 6 and 10 years old and 73 percent of 11- to 17-year-olds do not get the recommended minimum of 60 minutes of daily physical activity. Paris 2024 has been successfully advocating for this cause through various initiatives, including convincing 36,250 French primary schools to add 30 minutes of movement to their daily schedule. “We are currently running a survey in one of the cities where these different measures have been introduced,” Sallois said, “and we know already that it has had an impact on the concentration, for instance, of kids at school.”
Sallois also pointed to how Paris 2024 has provided more economic opportunities to local businesses and organizations. According to the IOC, “early planning before the election of Paris 2024 as an Olympic host showed that the Games would generate activity for 181,000 jobs in a wide range of areas, including event organization, tourism, catering, and construction.” To streamline the process of applying for these opportunities, Paris 2024 created a new platform to ensure small businesses could compete with those with larger resources, Sallois said. This is part of a social charter solidified in 2018 between local trade unions and employer organizations, a first in Olympic history, to open up more opportunities and resources for job seekers and small businesses.
The result? “Ninety percent of the suppliers for Paris 2024 are French, and 75 percent of them are small- and medium-sized organizations,” Sallois said. “This is a big achievement — [especially] for the smaller businesses, because they have gained skills and a competitive advantage.”
Sallois emphasized that flexibility — the ability to adapt to the host territory — will continue to be key to future Olympic Games. Paris is “a very old city with a lot of existing infrastructure,” she said, and with L.A. 2028, “you’re again in a very large city with a lot of infrastructure and this is why they decided to go to a radical reuse approach — no new venues will be built.” The Olympic Village will use the UCLA campus, she said, “so it’s really a radical shift.”
One difference between L.A. and Paris is that travel by car is heavily favored in L.A, but Sallois is undeterred. “Still, we can innovate,” she said. For example, buses can be low-carbon buses. “We will find solutions, we just need to work with the constraints we have in a certain geography,” she said, but that often just means “we will innovate even more. I mean, because the Games take place every four years, by the time we reach Los Angeles, there will be new solutions on the market.”
Using Paris 2024 as a test pilot, the IOC and other entities worked with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to develop a new methodology for evaluating the social, economic, and environmental benefits of events. Guidelines based on this new methodology were released by the OECD in late 2023 for organizers to use for their own events, which can be downloaded in two parts: How to Measure Impact and Impact Indicators. Paris 2024 also has inspired another new set of guidelines — an updated ISO standard for managing the social, economic, and environmental impact of events, set to be released just prior to Paris 2024’s kickoff.
For London 2012, “we released for the first time ISO 20121, and now with Paris we are aiming at releasing the new version that will [reach] another level,” IOC’s Marie Sallois said, adding that the updated standard will put a greater emphasis on human rights, social justice, and legacy. The IOC’s Panos Tzivanidis said that the certification is “an important milestone” for not just Paris 2024, but for the IOC’s institutional events at large. “It ensures that every event we touch is aligned with our vision for a greener and more sustainable future.”
“An evaluation of the sustainability of the Olympic Games,” a study published in the April 2021 issue of online monthly journal Nature Sustainability, ranks Olympic Games — specifically those held between 1992 and 2020 — as only marginally sustainable. The study’s authors collectively rank the Games as “medium” — 48 out of 100 possible points on the scale devised for the study.
Broadly, the study states that it defines a “sustainable Olympic Games” as having three dimensions: “having a limited ecological and material footprint, enhancing social justice, and demonstrating economic efficiency.” According to the study, the Games could improve its marks by drastically reducing the size of the event, rotating the event between the same cities to reduce waste from building new infrastructure, and create an independent body to develop and enforce new sustainability standards. However, such actions come with obstacles, including a significant reduction in revenue from downsizing.
But the potential to make a positive impact — beyond the Games themselves — is huge. As the Nature Sustainability study points out, “together with their exceptional visibility, the Olympic Games provide a unique platform to reach a global audience and could serve as a model for cities, countries, and other events around the world to emulate.”

Helping You Adapt to Life in France

In case you missed Part 1, I’m sharing my unique journey from I’ll-never-live-abroad to nearly-10-years-in-France-and-counting.
I’m often asked how I did it — and while several of my articles on TAIP touch on how I’ve been able to stay, I wanted to write it all out in a way that could be copied by anyone reading. Okay, maybe not anyone. It took a lot of hard work to build my life here in France, and it isn’t over yet. I’ll be starting my journey to citizenship next, which promises to be full of paperwork and even more determination.
But, I’m getting ahead of myself. Below I’m picking up where I left off on Part 2: I was an au pair, didn’t want to continue on as an au pair, but didn’t want to go back to the US just yet. Here’s how I figured out a way to stay.
I was always one of those people who said, “Never again!” after finishing my undergrad. It wasn’t that I didn’t like school — on the contrary, I’ve always enjoyed learning — but I was sick of papers and tests and all of the other coursework that went along with it.
Famous last words. As I finished up my second year as an au pair, I didn’t have many options other than the easy-to-obtain student visa. I decided I wanted to get my master’s degree. Public education is cheap here and I knew I’d regret it if I didn’t. This time, however, I was going to study something I was actually interested in, not something that would lead to a job one day.
I settled on French Literature. I’ve always loved reading and writing and I figured I might as well study the greats while I was in the city where many of them worked and lived. The only wrench in my plan? I still, after 2.5 years, could not speak or read French. In my defense, I came over here only knowing the basics, and as an American au pair, I was required to speak English with the children I took care of. At this point, I knew could understand about 75% of what was said to me, but I couldn’t speak back. It was a combination of a lack of vocabulary and confidence.
What’s more, I knew I wanted to go to a public school (again, cheap), and to do so as a foreigner I had to have a certain level of French, with a certificate to prove it. So, I looked around for some programs that would meet the student visa requirement of 20 hours per week. I found two: one at the famous La Sorbonne and one at the also famous Université Nanterre. I missed the deadline for La Sorbonne so that left me with Nanterre.
I applied, got in, looked for housing (and found the deal of a lifetime: I traded 10 hours of English lessons per week for a 9m2 sardine box in the sky), went back to America for a few weeks, got my student visa, and returned to home to Paris. Back to school, I went.
And so began my year-long journey to learning French. I loved my program — and recommend it to anyone who wants to live here long-term — I was the only Anglophone and so the only common language my classmates and I had was (broken) French. Our teachers also insisted that we speak in French instead of our native language. It was difficult, but it also felt like the best place to do it. Everyone had an accent, and everyone was trying to learn.
I met some very kind people, finally learned French, and also discovered more about French culture. We went on field trips in Paris and the Île-de-France region and ultimately all became quite close. Spending 20+ hours per week together will do that.
With my B2 certificate in hand, I was finally ready to apply for my master’s. I still wanted to study French Literature, and so started to look at those kinds of programs. I had a couple of informational interviews at various universities in town, before sitting down with one guidance counselor in particular.
She looked over my resume and experiences and asked why I didn’t want to study English Literature instead of French. At this point, I had started dabbling in freelance writing and had indicated that on my CV, and well…the whole “native English speaker” thing. I told her it felt silly to come all the way to France only to study English. Mais non! she assured me, and encouraged me to look into English Literature programs instead.
The meeting piqued my interest, and soon the curse of the missed deadline struck again — but it was for the best. Nanterre University, where I completed my French course, had a bilingual English Literature master’s program. Because I was already in their system, it was very easy to apply. I was accepted almost immediately (again, native English speaker), paid my tuition (400 € for the year), and began.
I loved my teachers, loved my program, and bonded with my peers. No, I never wanted to go back to school, but completing my master’s at a French public university was one of the best experiences I’ve ever had. I’ll never regret it.
After my two-year program, spoiler alert, I still wasn’t ready to go home. I met my now-husband about halfway through year one and things had gotten very serious very quickly, in true French dating fashion. We were making serious plans for the future. But…what about my visa?
I obtained the APS visa, which gives you a year to look for work after you graduate from a French institution. I did look for a job but I knew I wanted to work in English (even to this day I can’t write in French beyond simply texting), and finding a job that aligned with that was difficult. I had no issue finding Anglophone clients, but there wasn’t a need for full-time English writers in Paris — or at least, the jobs that I found didn’t pay very well.
The APS visa was quickly running out, so what’s a girl in a relationship with a French person to do? The marriage conversation happens. I’m lucky that I was with someone who I knew I wanted to spend my life with, visa issue or not. So, we made plans to quickly marry at the town hall so that I could obtain the vie privée et familiale visa.
Long story short, I did get that visa and so my future in France was secured for life. I’m not saying that everyone needs to meet a French person and marry them in order to stay here (indeed, there’s an entire shady trade in this which we may write about in the future) — there are a lot of other options out there including the profession libérale visa, or even a long-stay visitor visa if citizenship isn’t important — but in my unique situation, my husband is the reason I was allowed to stay.
That’s the gist of it — a couple thousand words on my journey to France. I hope it will serve as inspiration for anyone else who may find themselves thinking, but wait, I don’t want to leave too.

Paris is an amazing destination, but it can be even more fun if you know a few insider hints. I have been traveling to France since 1979 when I did my junior year abroad there. I became a French teacher and have been back to Paris around 25 times. Each time I go I learn something new, and many things can help someone enjoy the city more if you know them. Here are a few to help you.
The Louvre
Enter the Louvre through the metro and get off at station Palais Royale-Le Louvre(you will enter directly into the museum) and not the station that says Le Louvre( This will have you exit across the street to the Louvre) Something new though, you have to have your ticket to enter into the museum part of the Louvre, but it is easy to buy online through the Louvre at www.louvre.com or through the Paris tourist office at www.parisjetaime.com If you do not have a ticket you will have to enter through the pyramid by getting off at the Louvre metro or walking there.
There are bathrooms under both sides under the stairs. You do not have to pay to use them. If you use the bathroom in the food court you will have to pay a euro and 50 centimes.
Restaurants
The tip is included in your bill. Unfortunately, we have encountered a few waiters who have tried to take advantage of travelers by claiming the tip is not…

In these times, when supply far exceeds demand, and everyone is creating for the sake of sharing and appreciation, it’s crucial to take a step back, close your eyes, and find new perspectives. Otherwise, you might just end up bored and disinterested, since what you’re doing has probably been done before.
The unpredictable nature of street photography can be liberating, but it can also present a fog of opportunities without clear direction. You wake up in the morning, not knowing what you’ll bring home, which is fine and wonderful. However, there are occasions when having clear guidelines helps, especially when you are in a not-so-familiar place but want to make the most of it.
Living in the Netherlands, reaching the “City of Light” takes about a five-hour drive in an electric car. I’ve visited Paris several times, but this year I combined a weekend of tourism with my passion for street photography. With limited time for both, I needed to be objective.
The solution? To participate in a photography competition with a triptych mindset.

Last year, I was in the mood to read the classics, so I picked up “A Moveable Feast” by Ernest Hemingway:
“A Moveable Feast” is a memoir and a sketchbook of the time when a young and poor Hemingway lived in Paris during the 1920s.
He was a foreign correspondent at the time, and his literary career was just beginning. I hadn’t read anything by Hemingway in many years, and picking up this book reminded me how much I like his writing style.
“A Moveable Feast” is a bit random, as you might expect from a diary-style narration.
Hemingway writes about his relationship with his first wife and the woman he cheated on her with, who later became his second wife (spoiler alert — he had four wives in total).
He also writes about his friendships within the American expat community in the 1920s Paris, including his relationship with Scott Fitzgerald and other writers and artists of that time (spoiler alert — Fitzgerald was an alcoholic).
The book has many interesting moments. For example, Hemingway writes about being poor and constantly hungry in Paris, which was especially hard with all the bakeries and restaurants on the Parisian streets. Apparently, this is why his novels and literary works have a bigger focus on food and drinks.
“A Moveable Feast” is, if I’m not mistaken, the author’s last published work. It’s definitely a good read, full of stories about Paris and getting drunk with famous artists.
Beer of the day is an easy choice — my favorite Blue Moon!
I do repeat this beer quite a lot here, but it always features different surroundings.
This picture is special as it was taken at one of the stalls during the 2024 Edinburgh Fringe festival.
It was our first time experiencing Fringe, and oh me oh my, what an experience! It was truly amazing, and felt like a month-long carnival. I definitely had a post-Fringe blues afterwards.

I write book reviews, pair them with my favorite beers, and reflect on what the future brings.

For weeks my friends and I had been complaining about the constant restrictions in Paris as the Olympics drew near. Popular metro stations were being closed. Our weekly walk in the Tuileries was compromised by barricades closing off our route. I even took photos of all the street closings and fences, planning to write an essay about why one would not want to visit Paris in May or June 2024. It was a horrible mess.
Though I am back in the US, I am aware that it got worse in the past couple weeks. I would hear from friends about bridge closings and increased metro and road closings. People needed QR codes in certain areas to get to their apartments. They had to cancel weekly walks because it was too hard to get to a meeting point.
I think that speaks less about Paris and more about the world we have created in which there is far too much violence and terror. Annoying as these closures were, they were needed to provide safety to Parisians and the thousands of visitors descending on Paris for the Games.
But I empathize with shop and restaurant owners who saw their businesses dwindle rather than rise with Olympic visitors. The New York Times reported on a restaurant that I frequent on Ile Saint Louis where I live six months/year. In warm weather, I can…

People will argue with me on this. For many, the race last weekend: Ronde van vlaanderen aka Tour of Flanders is the best race of the season. And indeed, in terms of spectator experience and in terms of cobbled climbs, which separate the gladiators from the men, climbs like the Paterberg, the bone shaking and long Kwaremont and the Koppenberg, it is indeed a great race to watch. Last weekend, it was the legendary Tadej Pogacar dropping his equally legendary rival, Matthieu Van Der Poel on the Kwaremont on their 3rd turn up the hill, to take his 2nd Tour of Flanders win.
But for me, the race that has always fascinated me, has had this weird combination of mystique and fear, has always left me romanticising about cycling is none other than the race I am watching while writing this blog: Paris-Roubaix, often known as the hell of the north.
A bit of cycling context, the most famous race on the cycling calendar is the Tour de France, which is a 3 week long stage race capturing the imagination of everyone who has ever ridden a bike. The stages spanning through beautiful French countrysides, ending in sprints, the battles on the slopes of the Pyrenees and the Alps, it is hard not be romantic about cycling. It evokes the primitive of emotions. It is poetry in motion. There are two other grand tours: Giro D’Italia and Vuelta d’Espana, both of whom hold less prestige than the Tour De France. These are the 3, 3 week stage races. There multiple 2 and 1 week stage races as well and then there are some famous one day races. Out of them, one of the key races has always been the Road World Championships which often happens at the end of the Vuelta, toward September. And then you have the 5 Classics:
If you were wondering if there are any other cyclists other than Pogacar and Van Der Poel, you can be excused. Out of the last 19 Classics, 14 have been won by these two. I am writing this part with 52.5 kilometers to go in today’s race and Pogacar, Van Der Poel and Jasper Philipsen (Winner of 2024 Milan San-Remo and Van Der Poel’s teammate) lead the race by 1'18"".
Simple reason: The drama. Take a look at this picture:
And this:
The start point of Paris-Roubaix is variable, for example, in 2025 it began in Compiègne (Which is a bit outside Paris). But it always end up in the Velodrome of Roubaix, where the riders do 750 meters and often end up in a sprint finish. In 2025, the distance of the race was 259.2 kilometers and it is often in that range and during these kilometers, the riders go through several cobbled sections.
These sections are hundreds of years old and are maintained by “Les amis des Paris-Roubaix”. This group of volunteers, founded by Jean-Claude Vallaeys in 1983 maintain the cobbled sections in their pristine state so that the racers have the same conditions of the cobbles every year. The cobbles, as I mentioned before are the main point of attraction of this race. The sections are graded with stars, with the 1 star sections being the “easiest” and the 5 star sections being the most challenging. There are 3, 5-star cobble sections and the race has 27 cobbled sections in total. The grading is based on the quality of the cobbles and the distance on them.
The most iconic section of the cobbles, pictured above is the Trouée d’Arenberg aka Arenberg Forest. It is 2400 meter section of cobbles, laid down at the time of Napoleon 1. The intensity of these cobbles is mind boggling especially coupled with the fact that the entry to the cobbles was on a downhill section, causing the riders to enter the section at a speed of 60 kmph. (A highly criticised chicane was added in 2024 to reduce the speed of entry). Even so, the Arenberg forest, about 100 kilometers from the finish is the place where the first selection is made from the group of favourites. There are 2 more sectors of the 5 star variety: the 3 km long Mons-en-Pévèle which has 2 right hand turns while climbing steadily and the decisive Carrefour de l’Arbre, which arrives 15 kilometers before the finish line. The 2.1 kilometer section is brutal, winding and with its proximity to the finish is often where the riders make the final attack.
As you can imagine, the race gets intense as the riders jostle with each other to get the best line over the cobbles, the bike shakes and you see bottles and parts fall out. These sections are narrow and if you get a flat, it is in your benefit that you’re in the front and can get a wheel change. If not, you get stuck behind and can lose a lot of time. In the words of a former 2nd place finisher and one of the icons of Paris-Roubaix, George Hincapie: “This is a war, you give them an inch, they will take a mile.” This race gets even more brutal when it rains. In the dry, the riders just inhale the dust of the cobbled sections. In the rain, they get covered in it.
If the selection hasn’t been made in the cobbles and there are still more than 1 riders in contention, the decisive move comes inside the iconic Roubaix Velodrome.
For all the twists and the Machiavellian turns, Paris Roubaix remains the best race in the spring classics for me.
In the words of the most winningest rider of the Paris-Roubaix, Tom Boonen:
The 2025 race was the surprising debut of Tadej Pogacar, who at 65 kilograms is much lighter than most of his rivals, including the pre-race favourite and 2-time defending champion, Matthieu Van Der Poel. Van Der Poel also was aiming to become the 1st man since Francesco Moser (1978, 1979, 1980) to win Paris Roubaix back-to-back, 3 times in a row.
The first selection in the race was made, as expected in the Arenberg forest with a bunch of the pre-race favourites including Wout Van Aert, Mads Pedersen, Pogacar’s teammate’s Nils Politt and Florian Vermeersch, and Van De Poel’s teammate, former 2nd place finisher Jasper Philipsen. Pogacar and Van Der Poel kept launching attacks from 100 kilometers out and it became a real war of attrition. Pogacar, who had already crashed earlier in the day, was almost got taken out by his team car.
With 55 kilometers to go, Pogacar launched an attack which left only Van Der Poel and Philipsen in his wake. As the race proceeded, another attack by Pogacar dropped Philipsen. With 30 kilometers to go, Pogacar took a strong right hand turn but didn’t slow down enough which caused him to crash into the barriers. Van Der Poel maintained a 20"" gap from Pogacar until Pogacar dropped off his bike and took a new bike with 20k to go. The gap grew to over a minute, but in the Carrefour de l’Arbre, it was Van Der Poel’s turn to change bikes. The change came quickly and though he nearly crashed into a barrier, Van Der Poel was never in doubt as he rounded up the Velodrome to take his 3rd Paris Roubaix win. Pogacar finished smiling, content with his 2nd place on his 1st showing here. Behind him, in a sprint Pedersen took the last podium spot, followed by Van Aert and then Vermeersch.
Thank you for reading!

Henry Miller is one dirty cunt. I’ve never read Marquis de Sade but I imagined that Miller to be a modern day Sade, blending all the taboos he can think about (and I can think about) into one novel. Miller is no stranger to being a banned author. Tropic of Cancer was banned in the author’s country of birth until 1961, almost thirty years after it made headways in Paris via the famous publisher Obelisk Press in 1934, where modern day Shakespeare and Co. Bookshop is now.
This is the reason I bought the book in the first place, on an obligatory purchase and visit to the well-renowned bookshop. It took me at least a couple of hours to decide which book to buy from the place. In all honesty, much of the book available on the shelves of Shakespeare and Co. are available in other bookshops and for cheaper. But I’m a bit pretentious at the best of times, so I needed to pick out a book. Henry Miller, who created a career in Paris and owed the city his success was a logical choice. I have not read Miller’s erotica, so why not eh.
When Miller wrote Under the Roofs of Paris (formerly known as Opus Pistorum), he was broke, hungry and would write a dollar a page for this kind of smut. Paris was known for its erotica back in the early twentieth century, its explicit postcards (which also feature prominently in the book) and smut writing was of no place to the conservative American mind at the time. But this sexual liberation was perhaps representative of Paris at the epoch, and it took an American to crystalise that epitome of recklessness.
In the introduction to Delta of Venus, Anaïs Nin spoke about Miller’s venture in writing erotica, that the collector wanted more, that the writers started to exhaust their personal stories and had to look elsewheres. I wonder if Milton Luboviski who commissioned Henry Miller for this was the same collector which demanded Miller to write with less poetry in his smut.
Perhaps not. Because I don’t find much poetry in the book. What we read is explicit sex, sometimes performed by individuals who shouldn’t be having sex. Some of the age is explicit, and the protagonist, Alf, had also indulged in engaging with these minors. I do feel sick at the thought of it and it makes me wonder whether Henry Miller had the same experiences. It would certainly adjust my respect for him as a person.
In the book, our protagonist Alf took part in bukkake-like orgies, a threesome with a midget (which also involves a German shepherd with a generous phallus which I guess makes it a foursome), threesomes with Lesbians, shooting porn, and let’s not talk about his involvement with underaged girls. All these leisurely activities are implemented in an extensive possible combinations of holes, body parts and bodily fluids. This list obviously, is far from exhaustive. Miller writes from experience, and whether some of these had happened to him or his acquaintances, I don’t really know nor do I really want to care.
Yes, I can find traces of Tropic of Cancer here with its crude and detailed description of sex, which makes me doubt if I am adventurous myself in that way. Alf’s organ, John Thursday, is akin to another character that literally always rear its ugly head at the worst (or best) of times. It’s like Alf has a constant walking erection. Alf and John Jeudi seem like different characters, but forever interlinked to one another and dependent on each other’s existence. Come to think of it, all men and their wangs are like that.
After the first hundred pages, the book loses its novelty, which also made me wonder if I had grown up too much to read Henry Miller. In Malay terms, we can say it’s “jelak” which means feeling eugh after having too much of something, usually after you’re halfway through that bowl of Peter’s pork noodles and you regretted getting a large portion instead of small. But comparing Miller’s writing to a bowl of hawker pork noodles is probably not the best idea.
In fact, if I can compare the reading experience with another book, it’d be Bret Easton Ellis’ American Psycho, where the violence felt too much after a while, too caricaturish, far an adaptation of what we know violence to be. The sex in Under the Roofs of Paris is of a similar nature. Never once do I feel the reality of it, however visceral or extreme the nature of it might be.
Now for the million dollar question: as an erotica, did it turn me on? Based on what I mentioned above, no. But there are bits of it that made me raise my eyebrows, and more often than not, bits of it where I’m just shaking my head and saying yeah nah in my head, impatient for the next scene to unravel. I’ve read the book in my commute home in trains and over coffee, but thankful and hopeful that nobody is peering over my shoulder and basking over the gratuitous language.
On a side note, there was also the matter of Billie and Jean, the former more of a lesbian than the latter. Did Michael Jackson steal his most famous song from the characters of Miller’s work? No matter, if it was coincidental, then more power to Henry Miller. Another vignette: the book’s original title, Opus Pistorum literally translates to the work of the miller. Clever cunt, that Henry guy.
— -
On another P.S.S. read this stupendous essay on Henry Miller by Victoria Best, if you really want to dig deep into Henry Miller’s life and his past traumas.

I shouldn’t be getting into the habit of enjoying Easter holidays (or any holidays, Christian ones especially) and annual leave just in case I didn’t make it to extend my work visa, but truth be told? I do enjoy holidays as a normal person does and should.
For Easter this year, I went to Paris. When I received the job offer last September, I thought it would be proper that I started visiting some other great museums of ethnology or anthropology, so I could learn for my work. A great example is indeed, the Quai-Branly Museum in Paris, which I had heard several times when I was at school. This museum was definitely on my list of must-visit.
It wouldn’t be my first time to Paris as I went there almost a decade (2015) ago, during which I embarked on a less-than-72-hour marathon of “ticking the tourist’s boxes”: I was in Paris waiting for a flight back to Brno. As a poor student in one of the most expensive cities in the world, I tried to minimse my stay while trying to see EVERYTHING: Louvre? Tick. Château de Versailles? Tick. Champ Élysées? Tick. Eiffel Tower plus climbing it? Double tick.
I was not sure if this time would be better than a marathon, but I was aiming for a rather different route, i.e. another busman’s holiday of museums and histories. Yet, as the title suggest, unfortunately I was sick the whole time. To be specific, the moment I stepped off the Eurostar at Gare du Nord, I immediately realised my Easter holiday was going to be a bit of tumbling along the way.
There are two categories for my visits in Paris: the traditional way and the interactive way. Although the numbers of places in each category seem uneven, I want to bring out the distinction between this post and the next.
I definitely had to put this museum as №1 on my list, as I’m trying to be more prepared for my job at the MAA. I was also guranteed by many colleagues that I “wouldn’t regret”, “a must-see”, and they all left highly possitive comments for this particular museum. I therefore had really high hopes.
I arrived at the museum (with a low fever that was ready to rage in the following four hours) after I visited the Sainte-Chapelle in the morning. The entrance was rather empty, with a ramp that led to the main gallery. There was a large cylindircal space built with glass in the middle of the foyer, which ran through the floors and reached the basement, and through the dark frosty glass, it seemed to be a display gallery as well. (I will come back to this cool space)
Marching along the ramp, there was light and image of water ripples cast by an over-head projector, in hindsight reminding me the ramp of ocean tides that I once walked on in National Museum of Natural Science, Taiwan.
1.1 Oceania
I found myself standing in a tall and wide space, facing towards two galleries: On my right side was Pacific and Oceania; on my left was America. Immediately I was distracted by the large objects near me, which were displayed in a way familiar to me. Many photos of MAA taken by the visitors, no matter how randomly, often feature the large totem pole (1922.265), the slit gong, or the grizzly bear. It doesn’t mean that other collections are unimportant to them, neither does it mean that they learn a lot from these three display, but that they are large enough to be representative of a nice day-out on their photo albums. I am clearly biased for that I see MAA from a behind-the-scene, research-based perspective, and also I know a lot more collections that can be iconic. If I have to choose collections that represent MAA, I probably wouldn’t choose the above three. To me, the first impression of Quai-Branly, also the most impressive collections, could be these large wooden sculptured objects (masks, boards, ceremonial tools), but it may be completely different from what the staff members’ point of view.
Almost as a premonition, I stumbled across these two “boards” in a glass case. I didn’t know that later in April, after I came back from Paris, I would be seeing a large number of Gope boards with a researcher from West Australia. However, looking back the photos I took, I could see that both Quai-Branly and MAA shared a lot of common interest in terms of collecting policy, or put in another way, both museums were formed by early anthropologists who had a close network, who naturally formed the trendy studies of exploring the “unknown pacific islands” then.
I can recognise the very similar motifs of the face mask on the left side: heart-shape nostril, mushroom-shape dome above the head, and two dots, possibly pierced rings for decoration. All are present on the Gope boards I handled in mid-April. However, there are also a lot of features that I didn’t see on this face mask: The chevrons on relief, and the vibrant red, white, and black pigment commonly used. This object is also featured on Google Arts and Culture.

Readers discretion: Please notice that there will be images of HUMAN REMAINS (skulls) below.
Many objects on display reminded me similar collections that I once saw and handled in MAA. Strangely, through this exploration I started appreciating more my work and the reason why anthropology matters: The physical material being preserved acts not only a reminder of the culture that exists (or existed), but also as an evidence that shows that culture constantly evolves, and that artistic choices change all the time. Take the chest ornament above for example. The feathers being a crucial part in Asmat art were incorporated in a contemporary artistic creation. The handbag in MAA inherits the traditional material and presents a new usage, becoming a new tradition for the anthropologists in the next century.
It was at this point when the fever kicked in. I started feeling a cold chill spreading from my lower back, but my face felt so warm and my throat was coarse. I thought, however, that I was simply dehydrated, which was why I persevered.
Remember the huge cylindrical space mentioned before? I reached the end of the Oceania zone and met it again. Seeing through the glass, I saw shelves and storage units stacked neatly, with musical instruments arranged among them. Originally I thought it was a behind-the-scene display, allowing the public to see what a music storage house would look like. The tags on objects made sense. However, I was wrong, at least not entirely wrong. It was an exhibition “Storage of the unspoken” (La reserve de non-dits) by Youmna Saba, who explored the “sonic behaviour” of the ethnographic musical instruments. In the English booklet, I shared the same frustration as the artist explained,
[…] a great enthusiasm, then a lack of breath, before frustration set in. What can an instrument express in a dark glass tower the public only passes by?
The irony of preserving anthropological objects is that the method to extend the life span is exact the same to stifle the purpose of its life. There comes the philosophical question that many face: What use of x, if it can not perform the function when it was created? Does it still count an x? If not, are we simply doing the formality?
www.quaibranly.fr
The paradox is especially apparent on musical instruments, as they should be appreciated with hearing instead of looking. At the MAA, whenever there’s a community person visiting to see their own heritage collections, our policy is that they could choose to handle them with bare hands (without gloves), and it is amazing to see how, for example, musical instruments, sound when they are played. It is very tricky when it comes to wind instruments such as flutes, pipes, and horns, as we are not never sure if they were in contact with historical pesticide, which can make visitors sick. Nevertheless, the spirit is that the museum should be a place where people make the material legacies alive. I would love to know if this large display allowed people to physically handle the collections (it seemed close when I visited). If yes, how would the experience proceed?
At this point, you should find out that I had reached another section, Asia. Seeing the Paiwan ancestor board was really a nice heads-up. Another thing was that my fever was getting worse and I felt even more dehydrated.
!! Notice!!
There might be human remains (ashes) in the collections in the next photo. Readers discretion.
I was thrilled to learn more about shadow puppets from the audio guide. Apparently the fantastic performanceship originated in India, rather than China, which I was told as a kid. The story and the characters indeed changed and evolved as the style migrated and spread among different Asian regions. My first experience with shadow puppets was sorting them from the Skeat collection, which were less elaborate but all the same, impressive (See Z 33667 and Z 33587). I also admire how the Quai-Branly used light box to display the puppets, bringing the colours and crafting details to the eyes.
One can tell that I sped up my visiting pace as I didn’t take that many photos in Asia section.
The monologue I had upon seeing the Benin Bronzes was probably the same when visitors came to the MAA and saw exactly the same display. I have tried to explain to friends that museums simply couldn’t “pack them and ship them back to Nigeria”. If only it were that easy! Shame it’s not wrapping and mailing Christmas gift for Auntie Gladys. The most difficult part is never the practicality of packing and courriering, but the politics and funding that are involved in the repatriation process. Nevertheless, museums are not at liberty to share the details, which are the gap between them and the public.
I was really speeding up my visit without skipping too many collections on display, because my fever was getting a bit out of control. At one point I just felt I couldn’t get up and all I wanted was gulping water. There were at least two school groups at the same time so I used that as an excuse to proceed faster. The royal statue was the last before I moved on to the last section — America.
If I were to commit to a specific area of expertise, the First Nationas people in North America would probably be my second choice, other than East Asia. I know very little about them, but from what I was told and saw, I can relate the history of driving the indigenous people to extinction and how their land and language were taken away.
With a curator like Anita, a lot of research visits at MAA focused on American culture. I am not a stranger to many above. I was especially surprised to see the cape as I was 100% sure there was an identical copy of it in our own gallery, and I also saw the same design on a flyer for the MA Anthropology at Sainsbury’s Centre, UEA. I asked Rachel about it, and she told me that it was a popular design, and that was why it was widely used in woven textiles as gifts.
I spent around four to five hourse in the whole museum, and was absolutely drained when I left the place. I didn’t realise how sick I was until I realised I didn’t even want to shop in the souvenir stores, which I regret because I would love to get a tote bag. I got some flu medicine on my way home.
I had wonderful impression of Quai-Branly. The level and scale are what I envision how a museum of “world anthropology” should be. I still don’t think any museum in the world would be fit for the title “wold anthropology” for a simple reason: All collectors have preferences that are derived from their generations of academic focus, and those preferences are the reason why many museums don’t have the same level of attention on all cultures. Take the zeal for Oceania and Pacific Islands for example, both Quai-Branly and MAA have extensive resources and materials from the region. However, when it comes to Asia, they are usually relatively ignorant. I have to say that I do feel jealous — if that is a fair term to use here — because of my heritage, but I also don’t want to take away people’s attention on any minority groups.
2. Le Louvre, 29 March 2024
As I scrolled through my photo album, I realised that I did not actually like Le Louvre as a museum. If you quickly scroll through this section and compare the amount I wrote about it with Museum d’Orsay (next), you will know which museum I prefer.
My first visit to Le Louvre nine years ago was mainly to tick the box of “see the Mona Lisa (La Joconde)”, which I should say was a half-tick, because I never really saw it in an appropriate distance. My impression for the rest of the galleries was a bit blurred, and this was what I planned to revisit and take a good look.
I couldn’t describe how weird I felt when I stood at the grand foyer, looking at at least three moving escalators extending and ascending to mezzanines. I couldn’t, however, describe why I felt the deju-vu unsettling until I wrote these words down: It was a memory of rushing and running through the corridors, feeling pressed and shame because I couldn’t see the paintings. I have a strange habit: If I don’t get to enjoy a good thing properly the first time, I somehow would avoid coming back and re-enjoy it again. Possibly out of guilt and embarrassment.
I studied the map a little bit and tried to figure out which galleries I possibly had visited before just to avoid them. I didn’t, so I just randomly hopped on one of the escalators and was taken to a broad court full of Roman sculptures. It was a strange space for a brief moment, but in a good sense: The court was quite far away from the early morning crowd who were sprinting towards the Mona Lisa, so I could only hear the low and muffled talking and shouting through the walls. The majority interior design, including the sculptures, was white, reflecting the light and the cloudy sky from a high glassed ceiling. There were only a few visitors and they were sitting on foldable chairs, focusing on their sketches. I guess they were art students. I felt like wondering in a giant bubble in a sci/art-fi movie. In retrospection I am glad that my visit began in a quiet corner instead of another immediate overwhelm.
My strategy for visiting route is wondering and meadering, and avoiding the Mona Lisa at all cost (which is wise for a reason). Overall, I wasn’t impressed by what I saw that day; however, I found something new and it was a nice surprise.
I hope that one day someone could explain to me how or why there is a room full of historical scientific instruments in the Sulley Gallery. For a brief moment I thought I was at the Whipple Museum French Branch, as I could point to every object and name them: Butterfield type sundial, possibly of Augsberg and French made; equinotical ring dial; diptych dial; compendium; astrolabe; compound microscope, etc.. I tried to find more information about provenance and acquisition details but there wasn’t too much about them on the Louvre website. I’m also really intrigued to find out the curatorial reason behind the public display as I don’t think they relate to any other “artistic” collections nearby.
It was wonderful to see the gallery of Egyptian mummies and I vaguely remembered seeing them during the first visit. No surprise, it was fully packed with visitors. I felt a bit uneasy because I thought of the issues of displaying human remains, and all the discussion as a museum professional. Seeing so many visitors still not caring at all about what I thought was strangely unsettling and relaxing: I don’t think museums would ever be able to tell everyone how to behave around human remains, especially something with such high profile. A proportion of visitors will forever remain ignorant and have no regard towards any cultural sensitivity. I’m not saying that museums should stop trying to raise the awareness of respect and privacy, but to forbid a certain approach based on reasons hard to judge, i.e. whether the photos were taken out of despise/entertaiment/respect, is also a restriction of speech and could potentially create another type of dominance.
I don’t think I would want to come back to the Louvre the third time. Aesthetically it is an amazing museum, but I don’t resonate with the collections inside.
3. Musée d’Orsay, 31 March 2024
Before this trip, whenever I mentioned that I had been to Paris (ten years ago, almost), I had to say that I regretted not going to Museum d’Orsay. Yes, I knew it was famous and a must-go, but the decade-ago me was more keen on ticking the bucket list and less a museum person.
One of my colleagues was a passionate advocat of the museum. “Absolutely gorgeous” she said. And I found myself standing under an enormous arc where the train used to stop, now stood stunning marble sculptures.
It was stunning to see all three sculptures (above) displayed ensemble. The clever use of bronze for the sitters’ complexion and the amazing texture of onyx for their outfits really brought out them to life. What’s more interested is the labels: All three sculptures were under different titles once, given by the artist. They were renamed to avoid outdated historical racism.
www.musee-orsay.fr
I am always a fan of watching how the westerners portrait what the world looks like to them. I started paying more attention to this type of creation when I visited the Frederiksborg Castle in Copenhagen, seeing the four corners painted on the ceiling of the Audience Room that depicted the four continents of the globe. I realised how distant it was for the artist to even grasp the concept of what Asia was: The corner painting featured a Turkish man with a turban and a glorious moustache; a camel kneeling beside him.
Contrary to putting a Turk as a representation for Asia, the bronze sculpture in Museum d’Orsay, created in the 19th century, featured a more East-Asian-looking person, possibly because of wars and trade in East Asia. I would say this is how geopolitics are involved in art. On a closer look, as I wrote down this late journal, I noticed that the Asian representation was actually a female (the bossom) with a male braid. How bizzare and intriguing! Was this an intentional decision by the artist? Or was this simply a mixed-up?
A great deal of my visit time was spent in the exhibition Paris 1874: Inventer l’impressionnisme, which in the beginning I didn’t plan to go. However, I couldn’t resist a free exhibition and the fabulous paintings by Monet, plus the queue was not crazy long. In the end, I made the little detour and joined the little crowd (which turned into a massive herd when I left).
I thought it was going to be a “nice and little” exhibition featuring Monet and others (who, unfortunately, I didn’t know. That’s why I only named Monet). Have I been more wrong than this? Probably not. It was an exhibition about impressionism, but it provided a profound historical context on the social change and artistic evolution that led towards the familiar style we know today. There were lots of sketches, photos, and archives that scafolded the beginning of impressionism before I finally saw the Sunrise painting. During the visit I sometimes felt quite embarrassed because I clearly was not up for such in-depth cultural education, especially I was planning on visiting a niche museum later that day.
Every time I see a chinoiserie style in a painting or as an interior design, I always feel surreal. As a child I felt that Eastern elements were strictly limited in Asia, and to see them in a western setting was like seeing an ostrich among chickens — odd and distinctive. Questions like “Did they already know where China and Japan were?”, “have they seen our stuffs already?” and “did they know any Asian person?” will always be in my head. I wonder if it’s the same surreal feeling for a westerner to see late Qing court paintings, which were profoundly influenced by Jesuit missionaries.
That was the last painting I took picture of in the exhibition. It was extremely crowded and noisy so it was a good time to get out of the place.
I became a fan of Cézanne during my teenage time. I appreciate the saturation of colour as well as the clear boundary lines he used.
“Les Âges de l’ouvrier” was a gem among all the artworks that I took picture of. Fédéric was a symbolist painter, which means that his artworks usually contained hints and audience needed to read between the lines. The painting is presented in a triptych, which resembles a traditional religious arrangement. Among the children playing cards (symbolising vice and greed) is a boy, behind who a basket at his head position resembles a saint’s halo.
I finally acscended to the second floor where I was surprised to find a large crowd at the restaurant, and an even larger crowd straining their necks in front of, not just anyone’s, but VAN GOGH’s famous painting of the yellow room. I am never a fan of Van Gogh, so I used this as an excuse and skirted through the gallery.
I was glad to finish my first visit to the Orsay with Monet’s most acclaimed artworks. It was definitely a brief visit, but I made sure I had time to go through all the galleries. If there was any regret, I would say it was that I didn’t get a tote bag (but I bought a T-shirt with Monet’s artwork!).
Overall, I like Museum d’Orsay. It’s incredibly large with amazing artworks; everyone is going to find a piece of art that they like. I appreciate the map and directions that point to the highlight for a quick visit. The audio guide was insightful, though I was hoping for a more flexible touch, such as the one I had in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. The gift shop was nice (I only realised the importance of a good gift shop after this visit and I may come up with a short post about why they are important) but the location was quite awkward.
4. Musée Fragonard, 31 March 2024
I left Museum d’Orsay about two o’clock. Rather early for me; I usually reserve a whole day for just one museum visit. However, I was on a mission to a special museum before I left Paris — Musée Fragonard.
Make no mistake, this is not the Perfume Museum and it has nothing to do with Fragonard the perfumist. I believe that the name Fragonard is a coincident, that this oldest veterinarian school in France happens to have the same name with the perfume brand.
The museum isn’t in the city centre and I had to spend almost an hour from Panthéon (a small detour after Museum d’Orsay) on bus. It was pouring and I felt like the bus was waddling through a sudden flood in Paris, but gladly the tempest died when I finally arrived. I spent some time asking around because I found myself in the middle of a college on a Sunday, when no one stayed in the classroom. Two ladies pointed me the way.
People who know me can always be certain that I’m a big fan of medicla museums. I was definintely gutted to learn later that Musée de l’Histoire de la Médecine was not open due to Easter holiday, but I still had the chance to visit something related — animal anatomy, or vet science.
The Fragonard Museum was definitely a quirky place that can be easily recognised as a university museum: It is tucked away in a humble teaching block; except a few signs and a sleepy security guard 500 meters away, there was no sign to direct the visitors.
I was, nevertheless, amazed by the enlarged teaching models neatly arranged in the display cases. I had never been to a historical vet science museum, so it was a little bit overwhelming at first (especially I only had two hours before the museum closed, and I intended to listen to every.audio.episode.)
Not to sound like a Y2K emo teen but I love anything that associates with death. The rituals that human plan and do in order to mark, remember, relieve, and avoid death are remarkable… They are the last chance for the dead to look back the living world, and the living to forsee what it will be like when we step into the unknown. Object that we study in order to understand death are similar to that. Is this the reason why museums now talk more about resepcting human remains? I wonder; but if bones of human beings are to be treated differently, how come we don’t apply the same attitude towards other animals’ bones? I also think about the lines between collections treated in a scientific and anthropological manner: If a human skull was collected for scientific racism study, it would migrate to repatriation based on anthropological reason. However, animals that sacrifice or were intentinally made ill for scientific purposes were less likely to be treated with anthropological sensitivity.
I wish that there were more textual labels along the display, as the audio guide did not help memorise (it was great content, though, very informative). Or perhaps I just need to find another way to record what I heard on the audio guide.
However, I managed to remember one thing from the audio guide. The pictures above showed the signature on one of the anatomical models, E. Petitcolin, dated 1901. It stands for Eugène Petitcolin, the preparator and model maker of the vet school.
My experience at the Whipple Museum left a valuable lesson in my mind, that all of the great scientific achievement would not have been possible were it not for the tool makers, publishers, etc.. Our education focuses a lot on the theories proposed by the great theoretician and philosophers, but not much time is spent on what compliment their success. Take Auzoux’s papier-mâché human model for example: Hundreds of thousands (an underestimation) of medical students would not have become doctors if there hadn’t been a chance to test their knowledge before practicing on patients. Some of the model makers even took their craftmanship to the next level: Not only were they accurate and precise, but the colour and material made these models, though mass produced, artistic, offering inspiration and perspective on life and the wonder of it.
Petitcolin worked his whole life for the vet school and was a pioneer in model making and preservation. I appreciate how the museum preserved these historical teaching tools, and it was wonderful that he gets to be featured in the tour. I think all museums should, if given chances, reflect upon the assistants and technicians that did the bidding. One example that I feel right is the rooms at the Centre of Material Culture (of MAA), which are named after Clare Isobel Fell (archaeologist, 1912–2002), Samuel Cowles (museum assistant), and Maureen M. O’Reilly (assistant curator), who were women and assistant dedicating their lives to the work, but not necessarily remembered in the history.
However, this is not the highlight of the Fragonard Museum.
! Attention!
The photo below contain human remains. Readers’ discretion advised.
These are écorchées, or the flayed collections. Made by Honoré Fragonard (1732–1799), who used to teach anatomy in the vet school, these are considered the treasures of the museum. The technique that Fragonard employed is still not fully understood. I could see that this was dry specimen, and I assumed that the material involved a lot of wax, hence the shiny gloss on the surface. My impression was proved right when I read later, that these creations were made not based on anatomical studies, but more for a theatrical performance. I definitely felt the intense glare from the first standing man, Goliath. I feel very fortunate that I am not bothered by such beautiful creation because I can imagine many people shying away, and I understand that.
This is probably the longest post I’ve written in English so far. I’ve waited a long time before I even started writing it, and procrastinated several times because life since April has been like being strapped on a rocket while skating on icy road, totally chaotic.
I have a mixture of positive and negative views on Paris as a city and the two visits I’ve made so far. I think it is a wonderful metropolitan: sleek, chic, vibrant, and everyone can have a place; and yet I don’t feel like I can find a place there, just as I feel about London. However, this is not a travel blog.
As for museums, I absolutely give them a five star overall. During this trip, I have ticked more boxes on my bucket list, without loosing the quality and depth that I was looking for. The regret that I didn’t get to visit Museum of the History of Medicine is a strong reason to bring me back to this city.

Paris: where Love, Creativity, and Perfection Converge.
This day one year ago,
we were admiring the perfectly planned lanes of Paris while standing on the famous,
brilliantly marketed,
iconic Eiffel Tower
We watched Paris basking in the golden glow of the setting sun,
and then it all started to twinkle and looked even more beautiful and serene as evening descended.
Damn!
I admired the vision through which the city was planned.
I also read about its history, even though we walked over 15,000 steps a day. Human creativity and vision know no bounds.
At that time, I wasn’t sure if it was pressure, punishment, or reward, but they designed a freakishly beautiful city that endures even after you leave it.
So, as you stroll through the lanes of Paris, it dawns on you that something this grand can be created with stunning detail.
Perfectionism isn’t just a term;
It’s something that can and should be pursued.
If you do so,
you can create something that stands out
and remains eternal
for ages to come.
And even though it’s a big crazy city, with constant traffic and crowded metro rides,
there is love in the air!
There’s something so (geographically!) blessed about the air that it heals you.
You immediately miss someone in Paris and want to return with them. (This could be true for any city in Europe though!)
I met my husband after a month in Paris;
he stayed for two weeks longer than I did.
The first thing I said when he picked me up at the airport was, ‘This air is so healing.’ As the quote says —
“Breathe in Paris, It nourishes the soul” — Victor Hugo
So the air and city itself is enough to fill your heart, and yeah, it leaves a strong impression that you’d wish to witness this grandness again.
“A walk in Paris will provide lessons history, beauty, and in the point of life.
We did talk about history and astonishing beauty,
What is the point of life that you see by looking out from the Eiffel Tower?
One takeaway for me is that boundless creativity and perfection exist.
There is nothing wrong with obsessing over perfection.
You might as well build something resembling Paris!

Revoir Paris | Essay Three
I spent a month in Paris, this time, and could simply be there, live there, and revisit places and experiences that I have loved.
Mostly it didn’t rain.
As the days passed under skies of blue or mother-of-pearl, and I relearned the layout of favorite boulevards and quarters and how to take buses everywhere, and eventually mastered how to make it back to the hotel tucked into a sidestreet without first overshooting the mark, Paris began to feel more familiar than ever it had before.
Perhaps I could finally live there because in previous visits I had ticked the tourist sites off the list, and made the big-ticket historical, artistic, and literary pilgrimages, and thus had no further itch to scratch.
Or perhaps it was because while there I turned seventy (which was the idea) and brought to the adventure a mellowing soul.
I think it was the latter reason, mostly, but also because I had flown to peacetime Paris from a war zone and could remind myself viscerally and experientially of what I know intellectually: that a whole, beckoning world exists that is not at war, and that in the absence of war, life can be brilliant, creative, and happy.
Paris has not always been at peace, of course.
Some people know about the Hundred Years’ War between England and France (1337–1453).
Everyone in the world has heard about the French Revolution (1789–1799) — and some know of the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) and the Paris Commune (1871). [1]
Many people know about the high price in blood paid by the French in WWI; some would argue that this led a still shell-shocked populace to follow WWI hero Philippe Pétain into WWII collaboration with Hitler.
If you notice shrapnel-pockmarked building facades from the Nazi era, or memorial signage on buildings, you will learn of Vichy (French) police roundups of Jews and Gestapo executions of Resistants in the very heart of Paris. [2] & [3]
But on this day especially, the world — my whole world — became a jewel box (the Théâtre du Palais-Royal [4]) nested within a coffer (the Domaine national du Palais-Royal) nested within a treasure chest (the Palais-Royal quarter of the 1st arrondissement).
I paused at the southern entrance to the Jardin du Palais-Royal to admire Paravent Girls [5], an Art Basel Paris bronze installation by Egyptian multimedia artist Ghada Amer [6], and then flânered the lovely garden’s length.
I was on my way to the Théâtre du Palais-Royal to meet my cousin and her husband at a performance of L’extraordinaire Destinée de Sarah Bernhardt:
The stage goddess (b. 1844 — d. 1923) lived a hard-working, celebrated life, [7] and like today’s rock stars and pop divas, toured the world “collecting men and animals, having a baby with a prince. . . and doing it all with extravagance, humor, and unfailing commitment.” [8]
The producers were wise to stage the show in so sumptuous a playhouse! Seated on red velvet — or velour? — inside so gilded and plush a venue, one can’t pretend for a second that one has not come to lose oneself entirely in theatrical magic.
Now it is Saturday night at dusk in sharp weather. Night is rapidly falling as my cousin’s husband, Alain, shepherds us across Place Colette, where a crowd couples-dances en plein air to a live jazz and blues orchestra.
We wait on a curb at a red light in a drizzle. From afar, shimmering ice-blue diamonds jet and spill up and down the height of the Eiffel Tower [9]; the Tuileries’ Roue de Paris (ferris wheel) glitters like a diamond-studded hoop suspended in air.
Alain hails us a cab on Avenue de l’Opéra; the grand thoroughfare pulses with neon signage and street lamps and head and tail lights that shimmer off the wet pavement as if they are sequins and gemstones: rubies, diamonds, emeralds!
A switch flips in my neurocircuitry already buzzing from having been to the theater. But now outside in the dark amid festive crowds, the myriad lights have jolted me even more widely awake and strongly alive.
Sparklers go fizzing and blazing through my arteries. My whole bloodstream effervesces! If I weren’t bundled in a fleece jumper and down vest, my skin would be emitting visible sparks.

I met my friend and mentor Yves three years after arriving in France. I was a waiter in a neighborhood restaurant on the Left Bank in Paris. It was, with a stint at McDonald’s, one of my many student jobs. Yves arrived as we were getting ready to close. The kitchen was already closed. He said that he was very hungry and wondered if we had any leftovers in the kitchen. Unfortunately, we had nothing. I recommended a kebab place that was not far. It was at this moment that he asked me how long I had been working there, because he had never seen me, even though he was a regular customer. I also learned that Yves and his family lived a five-minute walk away. He seemed interested in my background.
 “I would like to continue this conversation on my next visit,” Yves said.
A few weeks later, Yves was back at the restaurant with two young ladies, whom he introduced as his daughters. Later, I learned that one of Yves’ friends was my teacher. This was the beginning of a great friendship between Yves and me. He became the mentor to whom I turned for advice regarding my student, professional and private life. His whole family welcomed me. I found a second family. Yves was Jewish. His parents had been in concentration camps. He didn’t talk about it much. One almost had to really press him to get him to talk about it. I later realized that it was more out of modesty and the fear of opening serious and deep wounds. I was often frustrated, because I felt that he should talk about his story which is part of a dark chapter in the history of France. Yves, who is now over 70, told me each time that I had the enthusiasm of youth and that I would understand later. This response frustrated me even more. I was often also struck by the fact that my friend did not observe the Jewish holidays. I brought it up to him.
 “Why don’t you celebrate Hanukkah or Rosh Hashanah?” I asked him one day. “It’s like you’re ashamed of being a Jew.”
Yves remained calm, but from his expression I understood that it was not the first time someone had made the same observation.
 “I am not religious. I don’t believe in any God whatsoever. I am a scientist,” he replied.
Yves was indeed an eminence in the energy and IT sector. He was very respected but that did not justify him turning his back on something that I considered fundamental.
 “But, mon ami,” I retorted, “you can’t pretend it doesn’t exist. You can’t act like being Jewish isn’t part of your identity. Your family, like other Jews, were hunted down and exterminated in camps just because they were Jewish. Not practicing your religion means letting the Nazis and the antisemites win,” I told him. “I hear you and you know that I fight against all racism of any kind and I will never stop. I will fight to the end for humanist values, but I am simply not religious,” he said.
We had a thousand and one discussions on this very important subject. Often, my friend agreed to answer questions about his family during Nazism and their deportation to Nazi camps. But it was painful. One of our points of contention was Yves’ political affiliation. He voted for the progressive left in the French political spectrum. I have always been a centrist. I did not understand his political affiliation, because I felt that certain leaders of the French progressive left were antisemitic, but my friend said that he recognized himself in the humanism of the left. He worked on projects to light up the world. I learned to respect his modesty. For years, I took advantage of current events to talk about antisemitism, Nazism and the Holocaust. He has learned to deal with my intrusions into his sacred and painful past.
Since the beginning of our friendship, which now dates back more than 20 years, Yves has never been the one to initiate a conversation about antisemitism. Yet, God only knows how many times we had talked about racism, intolerance, moral and material poverty, history, the future. It was always I who brought up antisemitism. Even after Hamas’ October 7 terrorist attack, it was I who opened the discussion.
As a result, huge was my surprise when my friend brought up antisemitism a few days ago, while we were discussing French President Emmanuel Macron’s decision to dissolve the parliament and organize snap elections, after the crushing defeat of his party in the European parliamentary elections on June 9. I thought we were going to analyze Macron’s political poker move and what it says about the young president’s place in French history.
 “I’m afraid for my daughters,” my friend took me by surprise. “Tara, I’m really scared. I’m very scared. Macron made a big mistake. I’m afraid my daughters will pay the price.”
I was speechless. On the other end of the phone, I had the impression that it was a total stranger speaking. I had never heard this trembling voice, filled with contradictory emotions. There was fear, even fright. There was worry, resignation but at the same time a touch of hope coming through but dressed in anger.
Yves and I called each other “Tara,” which means wise or elder in one of my father’s dialects. He asked me to come up with a name from home at the start of our friendship. I chose “Tara” because Yves was my wise man, my mentor, the father I had lost when I was very young. He was my friend, my brother. I was Catholic. He was Jewish. I was black. He was white. But we never looked at each other in these aspects. His family welcomed me as one of their own. I knew almost all of them, down to his cousins, nieces, nephews, uncles and aunts. When my mother came to France for the first time, a niece of Yves, who is a doctor, personally examined her to make sure everything was okay. She had given her the medical attention that my mother had never had. My mother swears by Dr. Marion Adler. It’s one of her best French memories. “She saved my life,” my mother told her sisters and relatives in Africa about Dr. Adler.
This June 12, Yves’ fears were due to the fact that the polls significantly favor the National Rally, which is the new face of the National Front, an extreme right-wing party whose founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, had declared that the Shoah, a Hebrew word for the Holocaust, was a “detail” of history. It is the daughter, Marine Le Pen, of this notorious antisemite, who is the leader of the National Rally. Over the years, she has embarked on a “normalization” campaign of the far right by giving a light face from the outside to a political party whose ideology has not changed one iota. The ideology is just dressed up in flashier clothes. It is like dressing vulgarity with Chanel. It will remain vulgarity despite its appearance.
Le Pen was paradoxically helped in her de-demonization enterprise by Jean-Luc Melenchon, her big enemy and rival from the far left, whose recurring antisemitic statements make her appear as a moderate, close to the Jews or even their defender and protector. Le Pen did not hesitate to support Israel after October 7.
Unsurprisingly, the transformation of the National Rally and the assumed antisemitism of the leader of the far left have plunged many in the French Jewish community into an impossible situation, particularly when an anti-Jewish act is committed on average every day in the country. While certain Jews, including the famous Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld, have said that they would vote without hesitation for the National Rally’s candidates in the event of a standoff between the far right and the Popular Front, a last-minute political party created a few days ago by the various left-wing parties to oppose the far right, my friend does not have a dilemma.
 “I will never vote for the National Front,” Yves told me, using the original name of the National Rally.
His comment revealed his deep thoughts: Yves does not believe in the supposed normalization of the far right. Watching it so close to power had brought to the surface what he had buried deep inside for decades. I actually understood that my friend had been reluctant to talk about the deportation of his parents to the concentration camps — who did not know each other at the time — because he was afraid that history would repeat itself. He was convinced of the duality (good and evil) which coexist within us humans. History is full of periods when hatred took over from tolerance. Yves fears a new Holocaust during his lifetime. He believes his fears are about to become reality. He fears that a victory of the National Rally on July 7 will bring back the Collaboration period, the period between July 1940 and August 1944 when France, led by Vichy France whose leader was Marshal Philippe Petain, was an accomplice to German crimes. Yves fears that a new far right government will unleash its xenophobic ideology like it did 84 years ago.
 “In your opinion, who will be the first targets?” he asked me rhetorically. “Of course, it will be us Jews, then Muslims or Arabs.”  “I think that Arabs or Muslims are first on the list, then non-Muslim blacks, because immigration is the cause of all of France’s ills they say,” I replied. “Then it will be the Jews’ turn.”
Yves and I did not completely agree on the order of target list for a far right government. On the other hand, we agreed that he and I were going to pay a high price. He, because he is Jewish, and I, because I am black.
 “They will send you back to Africa. As for me, I don’t know where they will throw me,” said mon ami.
There was a sort of silence. We both imagined where Yves would end up and the prospect was frightening. Yves seems determined to prevent what his parents and others had experienced from happening again. He considers various scenarios to protect his people from possible barbarity but, at the same time, he recognizes that living a persecuted life is not ideal.
If the National Rally wins on July 7 in France, a new era would begin in France and in Paris. It would be a new France, a new Paris, whose central characteristic would be the French first, and more specifically, the native French, the fundamental question being what it means to be French or what French identity is.
For the far right, being French means being white, speaking French and being Christian. French identity is thus linked to religion. Anything that is contrary to Christian values thus threatens the French identity. By deduction, immigration, particularly of North Africans because they are Muslims, is a big threat to the French identity. It doesn’t matter that the grandparents of these North Africans, or Arabs as they’re referred to locally, fought for France during the two world wars. Nor does it matter that a 1905 law separated the Church from the State by proclaiming secularism as a fundamental principle of the republic, that is to say, a free exercise of religion. In 2022, Marine Le Pen declared that if she were elected president “Algerians who already live in France and behave in accordance with French law, respect our habits and customs and love France, have no reason not to stay. The others, certainly in the minority, will have to leave.”
Algeria, a North African country located on the other side of the Mediterranean sea facing Marseille, was once a French colony. In 1962, it gained its independence, causing the departure of nearly a million white French people who had settled there. They had settled mainly in the south of France. They are known as “Pieds Noirs”, Black Feet, a reference to the fact that they lived in Africa before the Evian Accords which sealed Algeria’s independence. These “Pieds Noirs” have nourished a lot of resentment towards Algeria, Arabs and Muslims. They want their revenge. It is this resentment that has fueled the French far right for decades.
The new Paris will be an anti-immigrant Paris. Le Pen and her cronies do not differentiate between legal and illegal immigrants. The foreigners threaten the national existence. They are an external threat. It is the confrontation between the inside and the outside. This fight against external threats is necessary because it is a defense of the French identity, says the National Rally.
A white American Christian would tell me that they don’t see why they would be targeted if they decided to move or visit the new France. The response is simple: for the National Rally, America is the face of liberalism, neoliberalism and globalization, all of which are seen as changes which have undermined and continue to threaten the French identity. They must be fought to preserve the core. In France, immigrants are those who embrace American power with open arms, while the far right sees America as the devil, a hated outsider. It considers that the current French elites are under the thumb of the globalists of America which is the dominant in the narrative of the dominant vs. the dominated, as is told by the National Rally. Le Pen wants to “protect” the dominated or native French and restore French national, social and cultural identity against the dominant or the foreigners, whoever they may be.
If you are white, Catholic and speak French you will be welcome. For the rest, you will be an enemy from within. The National Rally has endorsed candidates who are nostalgic for the Vichy government and openly antisemitic. One of them, Françoise Billaud, paid tribute on her Facebook page to Marshal Pétain and the collaborationist priest Jean-Marie Perrot. Frédéric Boccaletti, another possible future lawmaker of the National Rally, founded a bookstore in 1997 which features books which deny the Holocaust.
 “Tara, I’m scared,” Yves repeated at the end of our conversation. “I have never been so scared in my life. I don’t see any escape.” “Don’t lose hope, mon ami,” I said to him. But deep down, I was just as afraid as Yves.
In a few days, a new day will dawn in France. Will it be a day of fear?

And I’m (finally) okay with that.
I’ve done my fair share of traveling — much more than I ever would have thought I would when I was much younger. I’ve been to many more than half of the states in the United States. I have been to Europe a handful of times and have enjoyed the sights and sounds of at least ten countries over there. I’ve been to Canada and Mexico. I’ve been to a significant number of islands in the Caribbean.
Sounds pretty good, if I do say so myself.
It’s just that there has been this one location — this one place — this one dream vacation spot of a lifetime, that has eluded me for lo these many years.
That locale — the stuff of fantasy and romance — is, of course, Paris.
These weren’t postcards from places I had actually seen. Nope, as a child my family’s annual vacation destination was our local zoo.
These were postcards I begged for from friends, family, friends of the family and the family of friends.
Anyone, going anywhere, all I asked was a cool shot of something tourist worthy. For the most part, I was indulged in my requests.

(France) Paris: Where Art Meets Life — My Journey Through the City of Lights,https://medium.com/@cosmoviolet/france-paris-where-art-meets-life-my-journey-through-the-city-of-lights-9adfc2e653fe,"Sign up

Hey there, travel buddies! It’s your girl back with another adventure that literally broke my blog last month (100K visitors in one day? I’m still in shock!). So grab your favorite drink, get comfy, and let me take you through the cobblestone streets of Paris — a city that feels both exactly like and nothing like what you’d expect.
I’ve been to 47 countries, but there’s something about Paris that keeps pulling me back. Maybe it’s the way the light hits the Seine at sunset, or how the smell of fresh baguettes seems to follow you everywhere. Or maybe it’s just because I’m a total art nerd who can spend hours staring at one painting (spoiler alert: I did exactly that at the Orsay).
Let’s start with the Musée d’Orsay, which honestly deserves its own fan club. First things first — this place used to be a train station! I mean, talk about a glow-up, right? The moment you walk in, you’re hit with this incredible ceiling that makes you wonder why we ever stopped building beautiful things.
I arrived at opening time (pro tip: always, ALWAYS arrive at opening time) and made a beeline for the Impressionist galleries on the top floor. The thing about the Orsay that nobody tells you is how the natural light changes everything. Van Gogh’s self-portrait at 9:30 am hits completely different than at noon.
I spent a ridiculous three hours just on the fifth floor. No regrets. Standing in front of Monet’s water lilies, I literally forgot I had a flight to catch the next day. Some American couple next to me was arguing about where to have lunch, and I wanted to shake them and say, “DO YOU NOT SEE THIS MASTERPIECE RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU?!” But I kept it cool. Mostly.
After the Orsay, I desperately needed caffeine, so I ducked into this tiny café called Le Petit Cler that wasn’t in any guidebook. The barista took one look at my camera and said in perfect English, “Another tourist who thinks they’ll find the real Paris?” I laughed and asked him in my terrible French where the real Paris was. He smiled, wrote down an address on my receipt, and said, “Go there after the Louvre. Trust me.”
(Spoiler: I did go, and it was this incredible little jazz bar where I ended up dancing with an 80-year-old Parisian gentleman who told me stories about meeting Picasso when he was a child. Some experiences you just can’t plan!)
After my mystery café recommendation, I headed to the Louvre. Listen, this place is MASSIVE. Like, you-could-spend-a-week-here-and-not-see-everything massive. I’ve been three times now and I’m pretty sure there are entire wings I haven’t discovered yet.
Here’s my controversial Louvre take: skip the Mona Lisa on your first visit. I KNOW, I KNOW. But hear me out. The crowd around her is insane, you’ll barely see her, and there are literally thousands of other incredible pieces that you can actually get close to and enjoy without someone’s selfie stick in your face.
Instead, I wandered through the Egyptian antiquities section and found myself completely alone with artifacts that are over 4,000 years old. ALONE. With HISTORY. In what universe does that make sense while hundreds of people are fighting for a glimpse of La Joconde?
But the real magic of the Louvre happens when you get lost. Seriously, put away the map for 30 minutes and just wander. I turned a random corner and stumbled upon The Winged Victory of Samothrace with no one else around. Just me and this 2,200-year-old masterpiece having a moment together. I may have teared up a little.
The thing about Paris that my Instagram can never fully capture is what happens between the museums. Walking from the Orsay to the Louvre along the Seine, I watched an elderly couple dancing to an accordion player near Pont Neuf. They must have been in their 80s, moving slowly but with such grace that several tourists (myself included) just stopped to watch.
Later that afternoon, I got completely lost near Le Marais and found myself in a tiny square where local children were playing soccer while their parents chatted on benches. One little boy kicked the ball my way, and before I knew it, I was in an impromptu soccer game with a bunch of French kids who thought my terrible footwork was hilarious.
These moments — the ones between the famous sites — are what make Paris magical. The way light falls through tree branches onto century-old buildings. The sound of church bells mixing with scooter horns. The smell of rain on warm pavement outside a bakery. You can’t plan for these things, but they’re what you’ll remember most.
Alright, time for some real talk about cash. Paris has a reputation for being expensive, and yes, it absolutely can be if you’re not careful. But it doesn’t have to break the bank!
Between the Orsay and the Louvre, I spent an entire afternoon at Café de Flore, just watching Paris go by. Three hours, two coffees, one glass of wine, and approximately 5,000 interesting characters later, I realized I’d just had one of the best experiences of my trip without doing anything at all.
A fashionable elderly woman at the table next to mine noticed me watching everyone and said in accented English, “The best art in Paris is the people, yes?” We ended up chatting for an hour about how she modeled for Dior in the 1960s. Marie, if you’re somehow reading this, you were the highlight of my trip!
Here’s what surprised me most: Paris isn’t perfect. And that’s what makes it perfect.
The metro sometimes smells questionable. Some waiters really are rude (though most aren’t if you attempt even terrible French). There are tourist traps and pickpockets and overpriced cafés.
But there’s also the bookseller along the Seine who gave me a free vintage postcard when I bought a worn copy of Hemingway. The baker who threw in an extra pain au chocolat “because you look hungry.” The stranger who walked me to my hotel when I got lost after midnight.
Paris isn’t a postcard; it’s a living, breathing city with mood swings and secrets and stories. It’s not always beautiful, but it’s always authentic. And that’s why I keep coming back.
So friends, has this convinced you to book that flight yet? Drop me a comment about your Paris dreams or questions, and I promise to answer every single one. Next week, I’ll be sharing my fool-proof packing list for a week in Paris with just a carry-on (yes, it’s possible, even for a chronic over-packer like me).
Until next time, remember what the French say: “La vie est belle, mais Paris la rend extraordinaire.” Life is beautiful, but Paris makes it extraordinary.
À bientôt! ✨

toThe term ‘Paris Syndrome’ was created in 1986 by professor Professor Hiroaki Ota. He explained it as ‘a severe shock that can require hospitalisation’.
Wait, there’s more.
According to this article from Huffington Post,
“The Japanese Embassy in Paris now has a 24-hour hotline for Japanese tourists suffering from the syndrome, whose symptoms can range from depression and anxiety to acute delusional states, dizziness, sweating, hallucinations and “feelings of persecution.”
The reason?
According to professor Mathieu Deflem from the University of South Carolina, it’s because of drastically different cultures and ‘unmet romantic expectations’.
I even have friends who’ve told me that they were disappointed in Paris, but here’s why I still love the city.
My first experience in Paris was when I was 21. My uncle and I were travelling to Paris and Milan, but I arrived a day early and was alone in Paris for the day.
What happened next was an incident that changed my life forever.
Going to cut the long story short.
I met a Syrian man via Couchsurfing. We met at the banks of the river La Seine where the locals were chilling. We just looked at the river and spoke. Between us was his airbag with local cheese, wine, homemade beetroot and classic hummus and pita bread.
He was a journalist and told me how he’s lost his home and a lot of his family.
In the middle of talking about the refugee incidents he has experienced and covered at work, what struck me was this particular sentence,
“You think your life is hard? Think about sitting in a boat and not knowing if you’ll ever see land again. Do this for days, and that life is hard.”
It changed my perspective on everything.
Here’s a detailed article about it if you want to read it later.
Even back then, there were certain challenges.
The menu was entirely in French. People wouldn’t respond in English. But you know what? I don’t see an issue with it.
I’m from India. And it’s painful to see how talking in English is a way of social stratification today. You’re automatically ‘cool’ and ‘well educated’ if you can talk fluently in English.
I mean… this is like Stockholm Syndrome.
When I visited Edinburgh Castle in Scotland, I saw how most jewels there belonged to the kings and queens of India. We were looted and ripped off so bad that we’re relatively poor even today. Yet, we cannot get out of our colonisation by pitting against each other.
The world doesn’t need to be fluent in English.
And here’s a trick that works if you really want the French to be nice to you.
Something that amused me was — each time I spoke in broken French, I got answers in fluent English.
But when I spoke in English, I just got cold nods.
It’s funny, but it underlines how showing a little bit of respect that you’re at least trying to talk in their language warms their heart. Warms mine too, when I see a foreigner speaking in Hindi.
Just saying ‘Bonjour’ can help.
Like everything else, it’s always the little things, isn’t it?
Another thing that helps regardless of the city is to be a traveler instead of a tourist.
Ditch tours, hop-in-hop-off, and the big shiny spots.
Walk into lanes of Montmartre, eat local breakfast, and let go of expensive tickets for the Eiffel view because the view is best enjoyed for free… by the river.
My mum and I visited Paris this August and sat here with some rosé and snacks and had a beautiful time watching the Eiffel light up at night. We also witnessed two proposals!
You don’t see this stuff paying 300 euros for an ‘Eiffel view’ table.
Talking about food, ditch your Instagram famous cafes.
I promise you, the bread you eat at a local boulangerie would be to die for. It’ll be fresh, soulful, and unlike any bread you’ve ever had.
I went to the famous cafe, Ladurée, and ordered eggs benedict. I paid 3.5 euros extra for spinach. Do you know what I got? Two brioches with a diameter of 2 cm and one small leaf of spinach on each.
It was such a tiny meal!
Meanwhile, here’s a local breakfast at a cafe:
France has made me fall in love with breads so much that I tried to find local bread in the 5 other countries I visited during my trip in August.
It’s worth the hype.
Paris is notorious for thefts and being unsafe. But each place has a reputation and as somebody who has solo travelled, I recommend you to follow the basics that you would anywhere else:
I’d follow this in Amsterdam, Berlin, and Melbourne too.
Doesn’t matter where you go, but being responsible for your own safety is better than being sorry later and blaming others.
Lastly, I’d like to end by — give everything a chance instead of dwelling on preconceived notions.
My biggest lesson while solo travelling at 21 was to view the world as a blank slate and let experiences fill in the colour.
I met a woman at a bus stop in Stockholm, Sweden. She was American-Chinese and first asked me if I’ll be ‘allowed’ to wear the dress I was wearing right now in India. I affirmed that obviously, I am. Why would I not be?
She told me that she’s always wanted to visit India, but it’s portrayed as being unsafe.
I swear, if you follow some protocols, it’s not unsafe at all. But if you do things which as a local even I won’t do, then it’s inviting trouble.
Paris is still romantic for couples and lovely for a family holiday. The people are warm, and the bread is even warmer.
Yes, some streets are dirty. But I’ve heard the same goes for New York and San Francisco.
Hop on to the other side, Champs-Élysées is so gorgeous.
Give places and people a chance. Don’t let media or a few bitter experiences fill your head.
Finally, try to explore like a local. That’s what differentiates tourists from travellers, in my opinion.

“It has bothered me all my life that I do not paint like everybody else.”
On the first Monday of summer, June 5, 1905, the Gare de Lyon train station teemed with fashionable Parisians preparing for their annual journey to the south of France. Only they preferred Côte d’Azur — like it was a club with an admissions committee, an invited guest list, a velvet rope, and a charming hostess waiting to welcome them. To them, paradise was a familiar word, wrapped in the routine and privilege of their opulent lives. They imagined strolling arm-in-arm down sunlit promenades, exchanging knowing glances with others who happened to look, dress, and speakl just like them. It was so comforting to be seated at seaside cafés, secure in one’s place — and equally certain that, beyond their tiny polished circle, little else really mattered. They were happy people, perhaps ridiculously so.
A different story awaited in the third-class compartment: thirty-six-year-old Henri Matisse wasn’t chasing the sun; he was escaping ruin. Although he too was once welcomed in Parisian society, he now wore a corduroy suit like a prison uniform, faded to a reddish-brown, and blending into the threadbare seat beneath him. He looked more vineyard worker than artist — save for the paintbox and collapsible easel at his feet. His face was etched with lines from sleepless nights and empty pockets, carrying the weight of three years of failure and rejection. This was the new Henri Matisse, one who had aged and fallen. Had you whispered to his fellow passengers that one day he would shake the art world to its core the laughter would have been raucous and infectious.
Even his wife, Amélie, who sat next to him, would give you a skeptical glance. Even her expression was tense with quiet concern, and this was no leisurely getaway to the Riviera. The couple wasn’t bound for seaside promenades serenaded by Mediterranean breezes. They had no home to go to, and no friends when they arrived. In fact were escaping a life that had unraveled, fleeing to a place that might offer at least a reprieve from despair if not the justice system.
Matisse’s fall from grace had been sharp. The Parisian art world once welcomed him with cautious optimism, but now turned its delicate pale back. Friends disappeared, patrons closed their wallets, and a once-promising career had sputtered. It was his fault, too. Rumors of a financial scandal hovered around him like a thick fog, deepening his isolation. Once a successful lawyer, Matisse abandoned that career to follow his passion for painting, but now even that seemed as enticing as a wet pavement.
As the train pulled out of the station, leaving behind the familiar smells of crusty baguettes, pungent cheeses, and steaming bowls of oxtail soup, Matisse cast a final glance at his former home. He was leaving behind more than Paris; he was abandoning a world that seemed so full of promise, now reduced to broken dreams. Yet, as the train chugged along the tracks, his mood astonishingly began to lift. Amid the despair, a quiet resolve began to take root. The storm within him receded as Matisse made a vow — he would find his voice again, silence the doubts, and reclaim his life on his own terms.
No matter how long it took.
Which is what is so ironic about the story of Henri Matisse in Collioure. Little did he or anyone else realize that in just 100 days, this trek south would not only transform his career but reshape the entire art world, leading to one of the most revolutionary periods in the history of painting.
In fact, Paris would never look at a canvas the same way again.
But what was about to happen wasn’t a miracle nor an act of faith. It was something deeper and perhaps more fundamental to the human condition. Henri Matisse was about to discover a Thrive Zone — a place where the spirit is liberated, creativity reignited, and the soul is fully restored. These are places where we become ourselves in spite of the rest of the world telling us not to be.
This is the story of how one summer in a small fishing village in the south of France set the stage for a transformation that would forever alter Matisse — and leave an indelible mark on the world of art.
“There are flowers everywhere for those who want to see them.”
A cynic would say every form of refuge has its a price. For Henri Matisse, his career suffered from entrapment in the bleak industrial landscape of Normandy. As a young boy growing up there, life was marked by the unrelenting grayness, suffocated by coal dust. He believed the world was colored in sodden skies, and monotony was the color of choice. Matisse would later recall, “Women wore black, and everyone wore a hat. It is a place where people don’t expect too many strangers.”
Even Art historian Hilary Spurling noted this was true, his early works were “restrained and traditional,” lacking the spark that would later come to define his painting. Only the public wasn’t interested in somber landscapes — it craved beauty, spectacle, and illusion.
Desperate for cash, Matisse even offered one of his canvases to his brother Auguste for 100 francs. The reply was as frigid as the Norman winter: “I’d rather have a new bicycle.” But the struggle was about more than selling paintings. Matisse was caught in a larger battle, a fight to find his place in a world that seemed hopelessly duplicitous and divided. He valued integrity in expression more than wealth, but now he was bereft of both.
Born in 1869 during the twilight of the Victorian era, Matisse’s formative years spanned the Belle Époque — a time of shimmering contradictions. Paris, the “City of Light,” was both a beacon of modernity and a place of deep inequality as well as rigid social structure. The elite lived in the glow of freshly minted francs, while the working classes toiled in the shadows. The surface gleamed, but underneath, resentment simmered.
It was into this paradoxical cauldron, where new industrial fortunes clashed with the remnants of old-world aristocracy, that Matisse and his wife Amélie found themselves thrust — while the working classes — barely literate, and so barely counted — were left to their laughter, tobacco pipes, and homemade plum wine. The glittering surface of society masked deep divisions — while the elite flaunted their wealth, resentment simmered among the lower classes.
It was how the Matisse’s became collateral damage in one of the most infamous financial scandals of their time — the Humbert Affair. A master manipulator named Thérèse Humbert had defrauded thousands through an audacious Ponzi scheme, borrowing nearly 100 million francs based on the collateral of a fictitious inheritance. By sheer misfortune, the Matisse family became entangled.
Matisse’s father in law was arrested, and the artist, a former lawyer, came to his defense. He wasn’t a conspirator, but the scandal stained his reputation and he became swept up in the deluge. And as the Humbert empire crumbled, so too did the Matisse’s stature. He found himself facing public outrage and financial ruin.
Stripped of dignity and resources, the couple with their inlaws had to fleeParis, no longer sure of their place in the world. Yet, what they sought in the south wasn’t luxury — it was something else, renewal it would turn out. Matisse was no longer simply searching for a place to escape; he was searching for a space to thrive.
“We ought to view ourselves with the same curiosity and openness with which we study a tree, the sky or a thought.”
Thérèse Humbert was the architect of one of the most notorious frauds in French history. Her rise to the top of Parisian society had been built on audacious lies, and equally fake noble lineage. To bolster her imagined wealth, she concocted an elaborate story about saving the life of a fictional American millionaire, Robert Crawford, who, according to her story, had gratefully left her a vast fortune. For over two decades, Humbert borrowed millions against this supposed inheritance, living a life of luxury while her lenders, many of them ordinary citizens, were left in the dark.
Through a web of deceit that had gone undetected for years — protected by her father-in-law, a Minister of Justice — Humbert finally acquired a newspaper owned by Armand Parayre, Henri Matisse’s father-in-law. This tangled connection dragged the Matisse family into the scandal’s orbit, even though they were unwitting victims themselves. But when the supposed inheritance was revealed to be nothing but a single red brick, the scandal erupted and scapegoats were needed.
France was outraged. The Humberts fled, leaving ruin in their wake. And while Matisse and his family although not accomplices, were tainted by their association. It took very little time before they found themselves swept up in the aftermath of one of the country’s largest Ponzi schemes.
The financial ruin, public scandal, and professional rejection that surrounded Matisse pushed him further toward collapse. No longer able to support his family or continue his art with any hope of stability, Matisse felt crushed by the weight of his failures. The Parisian society that had once nurtured his ambition now seemed intent on devouring him.
Yet, in the face of this disaster, the fall became the prelude to something greater.
The seeds of transformation were planted.
“I would like to recapture that freshness of vision which is characteristic of extreme youth when all the world is new to it.”
Sometimes, utter rejection is the precursor of renewal. For Matisse, this state of affairs forced him to seek refuge not just from scandal and poverty, but from the creative limitations he had unknowingly imposed on himself. Desperate and exhausted, Matisse and his wife Amélie left Paris for a small fishing village near the Spanish border.
Collioure wasn’t St. Tropez as they couldn’t afford the luxuries of the French Riviera that Paris’s elite were accustomed to. Instead, they found themselves in a fishing village hit hard by economic ruin and the collapse of its anchovy trade and vineyards, ravaged by the Phylloxera plague. The town, at first glance, appeared worn, scarred by decline and poverty.
Yet to Matisse, it held something far more precious than wealth.
“The light here is different,” Matisse would later say.
It wasn’t just an illusion either. Collioure had unfiltered Mediterranean light that revealed colors that Matisse had never seen before — due to the only East facing coastline in France where the Pyranees majestically seem to dive into the water. The reflections of the sea, the interplay of light and shadow, the vivid hues that soaked into the village streets — became his metaphor. A light which casts no shadows and eradicates contrasts. It was a new artistic language, one that spoke to him in a way that Paris never could.
Where others saw a town in decline, Matisse saw a world bursting with possibility. The decay of the fishing industry and the blighted vineyards faded into the background. For the first time in years, Matisse felt a spark of creative energy return. His focus shifted away from survival and toward the rediscovery of beauty.
The transition was profound. In Paris, Matisse had been trapped in a world of muted tones, of compromise and caution. But in Collioure, he began to embrace boldness, color, and exuberance. The sun-drenched hues of the Mediterranean landscape — lavenders, blues, deep reds, and oranges — burst into his work, freeing him from the restraint that had shackled his earlier paintings.
This was no accident. Collioure had become more than just a change of scenery; it had become Matisse’s personal Thrive Zone.
A Thrive Zone isn’t just a place to live or work; it’s a place where one’s potential is not only nurtured but liberated. It’s an environment where time takes on a different momentum, allowing creativity, growth, and transformation to flourish.
In Collioure, Matisse found exactly that — a space where the constraints of his old life could no longer bind him, where his art could breathe and expand beyond anything he had imagined in Paris.
“What I dream of is an art of balance, of purity and serenity, devoid of troubling or depressing subject matter, something like a good armchair.”
The pinnacle of this transformation came in the form of one of Matisse’s first works of the summer of 1905 appropriately titled, Open Window, Collioure. It wasn’t just a painting — it was a declaration of freedom that overcame him as he gazed from his hotel window.
In this work, Matisse blurred the boundaries between interior and exterior, between the familiar and the unknown. The colors — vivid and alive — reflected his internal transformation. Where traditional art sought to mimic life, Matisse’s work was life, vibrating with the energy of the Mediterranean.
Gone were the muted tones and tight brushstrokes that had once defined his work. In Collioure, Matisse embraced a radical new approach to color and form. His brushstrokes were loose, unrestrained, and alive. This work wasn’t just a product of technique, he was the same artist he had been in Paris just a week earlier — it was the product of an environment.
The vibrant colors of Collioure found their way into the depth of Matisse’s discouragement, and for the first time in his life, he felt free to paint in a way that was entirely his own. The shift was so dramatic that it left the Parisian art world stunned. Open Window and the thirty other paintings Matisse completed that summer heralded the birth of Fauvism, a revolutionary movement that would redefine modern art.
In one summer in 1905 he would paint over 50 pieces, and three of the ten greatest works of his life. Of course, the critics in Paris, accustomed to the soft realism of the old masters, were appalled. Matisse’s use of color was too wild, his forms too chaotic. His work was dubbed “Fauvism,” meaning “wild beasts,” a derogatory term meant to criticize the audacity of the movement.
But Matisse, like the light of Collioure, was undeterred. He had found his Thrive Zone, and he would never again return to the constraints of his old life.
“You can’t help getting old, but you can help becoming old.”
Henri Matisse once said, “There are flowers for those who want to see them.” But perhaps the deeper question isn’t why we see flowers — but who plants them in the first place. In Collioure, Matisse found not just refuge but renewal. Freed from the biting skepticism of Parisian critics who had dismissed his work as “scribblings of a wild beast,” he discovered a simpatico community — comrades who shared his love of nature and painted alongside him, as well as villagers who embraced his curious habit of standing before a canvas all day. Among them, he painted with abandon, as if creating art were play, not work.
For him, the humble fishing village was more than a refuge from Parisian humidity or a place of cheap lodgings. It was where the “flowers” of creativity were planted — a nurturing environment that welcomed his restless, rebellious spirit and spoke to his innermost feelings and beliefs.
Mornings spent painting in a modest studio overlooking the beach flowed effortlessly into afternoons of fish stew and Picpoul de Pinet. The Mediterranean light transformed the village’s modest facades into shimmering mosaics of lavender, red, and blue. Even the coarse shouts of fishermen, carried on salt-laden breezes in ancient Occitan, held an unexpected poetry.
What Matisse found in Collioure wasn’t merely an inspirational technique — it was a shift in his approach to life and art. He was no longer bound by the expectations of Parisian society or trapped by the weight of public opinion. The unpretentious simplicity of the village loosened the grip of doubt, reigniting his confidence and freeing him to create on his own terms. In this overlooked corner of the Mediterranean, Matisse found his muse, his sanctuary, and, ultimately, his transformation.
Not long after, he settled permanently in nearby Nice, drawn by the same energy that had unlocked his potential in Collioure — a place where he would spend the rest of his days until age 84.
Matisse’s story exemplifies a universal truth: the right environment can unlock potential in ways that talent or ambition alone cannot. It is the fusion of place, purpose, and opportunity that creates the conditions for extraordinary success. Yet finding such a place is only part of the journey. Liberating oneself from the constraints of our current environment — from the doubts, the criticisms, the expectations, and the customs that bind us — is often the greater challenge. To do so requires stunning independence and personal leadership.
Matisse left Paris at age 36 a struggling artist. He returned three months later transformed — his confidence renewed, his technique revolutionized, and his reputation on the rise.
Within a season, he had become a rival to Picasso. Collioure was more than a village; it was the point where talent and opportunity converged, where greatness and place became inseparable. Collioure, then, was not just a haven — it was Matisse’s Thrive Zone.

Paris — the city that has inspired poets, artists, and dreamers for centuries. During my recent 3-day trip to this enchanting metropolis, I found myself swept away not only by its breathtaking landmarks and rich history but also by the subtle yet fascinating retail trends that reflect the Parisian way of life. From cobblestone streets lined with boutiques to bustling markets showcasing local craftsmanship, Paris offers a perfect blend of tradition and modernity.
In this article, I’ll take you through my 3-day itinerary while highlighting the travel insights and retail observations I made along the way. Whether you’re planning a trip to Paris or simply curious about the city’s evolving trends, this guide will give you a taste of what makes Paris so timeless — and yet so contemporary.
My journey began in Montmartre, the bohemian heart of Paris. This historic district, perched on a hill overlooking the city, is a haven for artists and romantics alike. Walking through its winding streets felt like stepping into a painting.
Montmartre is home to an eclectic mix of vintage shops and contemporary boutiques. What stood out to me was how these stores seamlessly blend old-world charm with modern sensibilities. From retro-inspired dresses to handmade jewelries, Montmartre’s retail scene celebrates individuality — a hallmark of French fashion.
If Day 1 was about soaking in Montmartre’s artistic vibe, Day 2 was all about exploring Paris’s iconic landmarks and indulging in its culinary delights.
The Latin Quarter offers a treasure trove of independent bookstores (like Shakespeare & Company) and artisan shops selling everything from handmade soaps to custom stationery. What struck me most was how these small businesses prioritise authenticity and quality over mass production — a trend that seems to resonate deeply with both locals and tourists.
For my final day in Paris, I ventured beyond the city centre to explore some royal grandeur and hidden gems that added new dimensions to my understanding of Parisian culture.
The Marais district stood out for its diversity — it’s where high-end fashion boutiques coexist with vintage stores and quirky concept shops. This juxtaposition reflects a broader trend in Parisian retail culture: catering to diverse tastes while maintaining an emphasis on quality and craftsmanship.
As someone who loves observing cultural nuances through shopping experiences, I couldn’t help but notice some key retail trends during my trip:

In my opinion, most restaurants in the world would qualify as good not great, and very few are truly excellent. When I travel, I put in hours of research to try to find the great and excellent restaurants. Luckily, there are plenty of amazing options in Paris. I always wish I had more days and more stomach space to continue exploring. While I was happy with most of my picks from my recent trips in 2024 and 2023, some were clear misses. Of course you never know when a restaurant is having an off day or if you ordered the wrong things or if you were just too full or too tired to really appreciate it. Since I’ve only been to most of these places one time, I would not completely write off any of them if you hear good things from someone else. However, I will personally not be returning to the ones I say to skip!

All winter,after Father left for Paris,he sipped rough nouveau Beaujolaisin a dim Left Bank apartment,reading and re-readingmy tear-stained letters:Please, Daddy, come home.
All winter,my mother wept at night.My aunt whispered:he will never come back for us.My Jesus-loving auntie preachedabout foreign womenwith sinful smilesand bodies unshaven.
All winter,I waited for my father’s arms,his scratchy beard against my cheek.All winter,my mother doted on my kid brother,the one who looked like Dad.
All winter,I studied hard — math and science,because my father saidI was smart,said I would be a scientist.

We came to France to visit Nantes, where my son lives. But I would love to travel to Paris too, so we will stay here for two days and then go to Nantes. We must stop in Paris and taste it again. But we end up in a food coma. We are going to cram Paris in just two days. But this time around, I found something unexpected.
The skies were clear as we landed at Charles de Gaulle airport. Our United flight 990 was unexpectedly impressive. They fed us terrible food the entire time, but the staff was friendly. Get a cab to town next; don’t take the Metro with all your heavy bags after the long trip. We did that once and deeply regretted it. Make sure you find the official ones, which are found at sortie 24. Don’t fall for the gypsies.
We rented an Air B&B in Le Marais at Rue Vielles de Temple. Usually, the pictures look better, but this one was the exact opposite. If you rent an Air B&B when you travel to Paris, remember to arrange for the owner to meet at the door because, unlike in the United States, you can’t just get there, get a code, and get in. In most cases.
After settling in the apartment, we walked through Le Marais. It was quite an experience because you find yourself in a different world, and the contrast back home gives you a buzz…

I’m sitting at the Air France Lounge at Charles De Gaulle, pulling down episode two of Studio 60 over the wi-fi so I can watch it on the flight back, and figured I’d do a little blogging while I’m at it. I’ve been in Paris the past two days to do a speech for Disney, which means, of course, that I fly all the way from New York to Paris and then I’m immediately taken to Paris Disneyland, where they’ve put me up in the “New York” hotel. Of all the Baudrillardian ironies…
I’ve done a lot of these two day trips to foreign cities in recent years: Lisbon, Hong Kong, Paris, Hamburg, Amsterdam, London many times. They can be a little exhausting, but I’ve grown fond of the routine. There’s no time to actually try to see anything systematically, no time even to really acclimate to the place. So I basically just try to take a half day and evening, and just walk around with no real destination, letting the natural flow of the city direct me. In cities that I know quite well, like London or Paris, the fun of it is in figuring out the limits of my knowledge, in others it’s more of a process of discovery. And I always try to have some new music that I’ve just downloaded, to listen to on the iPod as a soundtrack. It embeds this lovely — and enduring — connection between the music and the memory of a place…
But enough about all that — SARAH JESSICA PARKER is sitting right next to me in the Lounge!! Does Gawker have a Paris edition?

The Petit Palais in Paris is only a hundred and twenty years old — give or take half a decade. It was built, along with the Grand Palais across the street, for the Exposition Universelle of 1900. Two years later the Petit Palais was designated a museum, and today it is part of the glorious collection of free museums of the City of Paris.
So nobody has ever lived in the palace. But one can dream.
The Petit Palais is on the right bank of the Seine, a pleasant twenty minute walk from my home, and often along the path to or from another destination. It is easy to wander in and out again, particularly if you use the ground floor entrance where there is almost never a line as you pass through security.
Gustave Courbet’s Le Sommeil (The Sleepers, 1866), my favorite erotic painting of all time, is housed in one of the large galleries, along with a number of Courbet’s other nineteenth-century masterpieces. I’ve copped to my fondness for this extraordinary painting in another story.

PORTLAND IS MY PARIS
This weekend the city isn’t an option. My head needs to be cleared by things green and blue and misty, so the men on East 80th rent me a cherry-juice Kia Forte and I merge onto Manhattan’s rush hour traffic. It’s been three days since I picked the spot, arranged for a car and room and a brief search on things to do. Half-because a music producer told me it’s a nice place, half-because it’s a 6-hour drive if I go toll-free, which I like.
I pull off in Worcester for relief and caffeine. Sky-high dark and stormies have been chasing me since my tires hit the Massachusetts state line, and I am counting on the break for them to sort themselves. I corner off on Madison Street. Memories of grey-blue Renegades, rolling bike paths, Mormon propaganda on flat screens, the spindly tree on State St, 50+ missed calls go by - I am on the wrong side of the station for the rental’s pump, despite looking directly at the dash.
Ghosts living and dead have been following me lately; my life has turned into a marathon of goodbyes. I passed a man identical to Owen by Union Square after work yesterday — my brain remembered he’s been dead since January only after it recognized the face. (I’m editing this now in Boston, a stone’s throw from where we went on drives, where I clasped a golden chain twice looped around his wrist).
Returning the comically-large restroom key, jostling against the counter with its grotesque embody, I trade the phosphorescent lovingly-scratched lotto ticket I won back in February, cashed in for two cokes and a fistful of change, and don’t think about how much has changed since then, either. There are narratives you choose, to save most of your mind from obsession. There are words I take care not to write as doing so risks more of me than I could take. I post that I like to keep my cash options in winning tickets and send my dad the new ETA, pushed back 10 minutes.
(The coffee machine in my hotel room is haunted. It’s gurgling foaming with hot water but none goes to where my grounds are. Half-done, trying, hot, not enough. I put the mug with a tea bag in and dump the hot water from the mouth of the machine in, scalding some fingers and toes. Get it done, be creative, keep it moving).
Pulled from a drunken slumber, bedsheets indented into my cheeks, I gather hot coffee from the lobby to save myself further scorching, and wander cobblestone-padded streets, my shoes fitting not-to-neatly between the stones. Not much is open so early but enough are awake, townies and regulars who are glad for the company and small talk chatter. My list of places to visit grows, although I know readily I won’t see so much as half of them, it’s a bit addicting to play the part of traveler. I appreciate feeling temporary.
After reassurance from the daughter of a shop-owner that the rain, if anything, enhances the landscape more than derails - I swing into the cherry-red and take myself out to lighthouses and state parks, $7 for outsiders. My dad chats with me on the way, he’s seemed worried about me as of late and I can’t quite stop his fears from spilling over. It’s raining and I am pleased and calm and miserable altogether.
There isn’t an easy way to explain how I’m doing, and most people don’t ask beyond politeness. I tell confidants what I believe to be my best wording. I say I wish I could control the pain, let the psychedelic-drunk swinging punches into transit air land one, let the bruise prove. They say to stop, that I’m no longer being funny.
I can’t find the right order of words to explain how untrue it is that I’m doing well, because I have not adopted the socially acceptable behaviors of someone not doing well. I work, I shower, but I am not there. I am tethered by a thread - the kind one absentmindedly pulls at on their knit sweaters or worn skirts, slowly raveling around a finger until the pressure snaps. The base is rooted in the platelets spanning my hips, right where my spine becomes body.
My mind plans for when my body no longer does what it should. For when it morphs into the shapeless entity folks imply I am not when they say, “You seem to be handling all of this well.” I don’t need compliments, I need someone to want to sit with me in the madness under pale moons. I fear I rip the good things in my life to prove I can, and in flashes I see it happening. All I’ve been feeling lately is silent.
A, another, before and after has formed. My life as thin as Bible pages, divided into histories, plays, songs, poems, scrawled pages of repetitive obsessive YOU ARE ALIVE as a mantra to remember I don’t have a choice but continue. Divisions occur and I am spectator and recipient, captivated by my continual disbelief in how I’ve gotten it wrong, I have lost a little bit more once again, nothing was mine to begin with.
My fingers freeze around a half-fist, curled around my umbrella (the one I’ll forget in a coffee chain by Union Square a week later), before I decide to call it quits and head back to the hobbled groupings of urban life within Portland. I have been (perhaps, in-error) working to keep the love I have, is what I’m gathering, that in American fashion I believe the luxuries of complacency can only bring calamity. Rosy-cheeked angels in rustic basement bars will warp into stonewalls, I should let them thin out the strings of this thread if that’s what they’d like to do.
I drink, and some more at Papi Portland. I shake off two dirt smeared men who follow me across Fore and Congress streets. I get two steps into a speakeasy before giving up at the third, unable to bring myself to swinging open unmarked doors. A psychic calls me back, meets me twenty minutes later to tell me what I already know, but she’s kind and doesn’t push too hard her enrollment program to unearth my generational curse. Now knowingly burdened with ancestors' fuckups, I trod along.
I bring the girl with me back to Brooklyn, who had such pleasures in bringing ghosts’ particulars by frame in conversations with strangers. I have built up an instinct that must now go ignored, muscles I’ve worked for years. I’m not promised anything, comforts or friends or family, do I close myself off for reprieve? How do I take this in, swallow and be someone I like?
I succumb to a sense of shyness once I feel known; how bold I am as a stranger, how timid I am the more I open. How do I feel destined for apathy but have hope for more?
There is a strip club, Mickey’s, directly on the border of the Rhode Island state line. Beer buckets advertised on-sale, void parking lots. Middle of a suburban neighborhood, some moments feel significant for nothing. Escape is temporary, my loves and losses circle back as haunting, as companions. But I have time and myself, constant motion brings perspective across the multitudes of lives as deep and complex, horrible and lonely as I fear mine to be.
I follow ghosts back, I live where my mother was born. I look at shelves Owen, inky bare skin and the kindest smile crinkled-eyes, installed in my room less than a year before, I don’t think about moving. The mind isn’t forever, either - I’ll forget eventually, the street names and phrasings and fights. I hope I won’t forget what I’ve loved, immortalized in menial tombs.
Life is patient back in Brooklyn for me to see the bigger picture, to see the schism of light. I daydream about when I crack, as foretold, as if that will bring understanding through manmade anxieties. I envision it’ll unlock something, unlodge so I feel lighter, free fall with ribbons of my grief momentarily wings. The day will come, I promise, I’m hoping for Revelations.

I stepped out on a cold, damp January morning to walk to the nearby supermarket for groceries. When I reached, I realized I had forgotten my phone.
My language handicap gnawing at me as I needed the French-English translation app I was using.
I didn’t speak a word of French, which wasn’t ‘Bonjour’, ‘Merci’ or ‘Au revoir’ back then. I was looking for salt at the supermarket.
It was the start of 2016. I had just moved to Paris. For a couple of months, my husband’s MBA hostel became our abode. He was pursuing his MBA at HEC Paris back then.
And I was tagging along while continuing to do my old job from Paris.
“There is but one Paris and however hard living may be here…the French air clears up the brain and does one good.”- Vincent van Gogh
The HEC campus was brilliant. I got a first-hand insight into the top MBA college experience.
There were parties, partner engagement group activities, gym, and lectures. With time, we found an elite group of friends to hang out with. This brought in the feeling of ‘a home away from home’.

‘You have any idea if I can use this coupon or do I have to put a coin in?’
‘Ma’am I’ve got no idea. I’m just trying to get to the toilet.’
Apple pay worked on the second try, and the turnstile swung open to the sordid men’s room of the Gare du Nord station. I paid and I pissed. I rejoined mum in the queue for the self-operated ticket machine, which we eventually summitted, only to find all 3 out of order. Stranded in the underground of one of Paris’ busiest stations, fearing for our lives, we sought concord by the help desk.
I’d had far from a glowing first impression — I figured I was already starting to buy into the Paris syndrome — the heightened expectations. The inevitable letdown.
I had hardly been won over on the way here. The views from the Eurostar had been, actually, short of spectacular.
‘I’m pretty sure we just popped out the tunnel in France. Looks like England but worse.’
What I didn’t realise, as I complained to my girlfriend about the Merville countryside, was that France doesn’t just look like England. Just like home, France is a parasite. Slums feeding off the prestige of the capital. Like London, Paris is a very rich city attached to an otherwise lacklustre country.
I’d seen and dismissed the outskirts, the prefabs enlivened by graffiti and the…

Paris is one of the most visited cities in the world, but you will enjoy your stay more if you understand the complicated toilet culture. Parisien toilets are almost as diverse as the French cheeses, and the etiquette for using them can be confusing for a first-time visitor. I have taken 20 student groups to Paris, and I always tell my students to use a bathroom when they see one so there are fewer emergency situations.
Let me help you with what you need to know.
In the Louvre. In the main lobby under the stairs there are free bathrooms. The bathroom at the food court costs 50 centimes, and there is a bathroom that claims to be the cleanest in Paris. This bathroom is the most expensive. Obviously, you should use the free bathroom, but it helps you to know what to expect from the other two.
In the Luxembourg gardens. There are free bathrooms in the front to the left, at the back, and in the middle near the tennis court. It is expected for you to leave a small tip at the counter. I usually leave 20–50 centimes.
Public street bathrooms. There are public bathrooms on the street that look like spaceships. You will need change. They self-clean in between use, so wait for the green light.
In Cafés. If you need to use the bathroom in a café, you should buy something. You usually don’t need to pay in a café. Sometimes the owner will give you a jeton to use as a coin.
Although they are a rarity now, you might find a type of bathroom called Napoleon. It is two feet separated by a hole. When you flush make sure to step away from the feet because the water will wash over the feet.
I hope these suggestions help you to understand the bathroom culture.

Paris may be known as the city of love, but it’s also a city known for its fashion, if Emily in Paris has anything to say about it. As one of the “Big Four” fashion weeks (alongside New York, Milan, and London), Paris has cemented its legacy as the epicenter of haute couture and ready-to-wear collections.
Paris Fashion Week is an event that kickstarts trends off the runways and into retail stores and wardrobes globally. Here’s what you should know about it:
Paris Fashion Week wasn’t always as famous as it is now. Back in 1973, the French Fashion Federation established it as an official event to showcase the country’s unparalleled sartorial talent. But you’d be surprised to know that Paris’s love affair with high fashion goes back a long way.
In the 17th century, Louis XIV, also known as the Sun King, played an influential role in elevating France’s reputation for luxury fashion. The monarchy’s patronage of the textile industries and ateliers established Paris as a global destination for style and sophistication.
By the 19th century, the arrival of Charles Frederick Worth (considered to be the father of haute couture) solidified France’s dominance when it came to fashion. His maison became a pilgrimage site for royalty and aristocracy. It also ended up laying the groundwork for Parisian fashion houses that are revered today — including Chanel and Dior. French fashion dresses became the trend, stemming from the fact that France became known for its quality, style, and elegance.
Paris Fashion Week might be synonymous with sophistication, but its real value lies in its diversity. It’s where avant-garde designers share the stage with heritage brands, creating a rich tapestry of styles and narratives. The event has two objectives: to present haute couture and ready-to-wear styles that speak to elites and everyday fashion enthusiasts, but also to set the tone for trends in the coming year.
Haute couture, which Paris exclusively champions, is an art form in itself. Each piece is generally handcrafted, taking hundreds of hours in craftsmanship alone. Designers like Christian Dior redefine feminine forms and designs, while other designers challenge history and society’s rules for what fashion should be. In the ready-to-wear segment, Paris outshines many other fashionable cities, due to designers pushing boundaries while maintaining elegance and structure in their clothing.
Paris Fashion Week’s influence on global trends is unparalleled. Each season, designers debut collections that reflect cultural shifts, technological advancements, and environmental consciousness. From the rising popularity of gender-neutral fashion and artisanal clothing to the integration of sustainable practices, Paris runways are a microcosm of broader societal ideals.
Think about the past Paris Fashion Weeks — there was a time when fashion was all about the classic silhouette. But during Fashion Weeks in the 2010s, this notion was dispelled. Designers like Maria Grazia Chiuri and Virginie Viard breathed new life into traditional forms, blending history with modernity while retaining sophistication. Paris Fashion Week is also an event where it is consistently proved that fashion isn’t just about wearable clothing — it’s also about conceptual art.
Many people believe that Paris Fashion Week is only about showcasing French designers, but that’s not the case at all. It’s a global platform that celebrates talent from around the world. Many designers see it as an award of sorts because it is the ultimate stage to attain recognition. This is also a stage for established brands to reaffirm their status and gain brand retention among their customer base.
The event also acts as a launchpad for emerging designers. Initiatives like the ANDAM Fashion Award spotlight fresh talent. It gives budding designers the opportunity to present their work to an audience of industry leaders, buyers, and journalists. These platforms are monumental in shaping the next generation of fashion, making sure that Paris will forever remain at the forefront of innovation.
In the past few years, especially after COVID-19, technology has transformed the way many experience Paris Fashion Week. Live-streamed shows, virtual reality experiences, and social media have democratized access, allowing millions to view this event while it’s occurring. Social media platforms have become integral to the event, with influencers and brands using them to amplify their audience reach.
But despite its long legacy and renown, Paris Fashion Week is not a stranger to challenges. From rising calls for sustainability to accessibility, there are many areas where progress is being made. The rise of digital fashion — virtual garments and NFTs — poses both a challenge and an opportunity. Paris Fashion Week has begun to explore these frontiers, as well as others, in an effort to remain relevant even during changing times.
Considering Paris Fashion Week’s history, it’s clear how important it has become in the fashion world. It’s not just that it’s a legacy event; it’s an event that sets standards for fashion everywhere in the world. It’s a cultural phenomenon that dictates how we perceive and engage with fashion, even on a daily basis. The colors, styles, and fits that are all the rage today were on the runways at some point in time, showing just how influential this event is.

Fifty kilometers northwest of Paris the green fields roll gently in the early morning dew.
I glance at the sun rising over the horizon through the lozenge window of my tiny, black Renault Twingo, and feel around the passenger seat for my sunglasses, eyes on the road.
The windshield clouds and I have to keep raising the defrost and turn on the wipers — it’s that early in the morning in July. Mist drifts in the hollows.
I’m all alone on the road, but for a singular vehicle in a highway lane on the opposite direction speeding across my line of vision, and the always present trucks that appear as if born from the topography.
In open green fields, stucco and tile farmhouses interrupt the eye, draw it in and I wonder about the length of time these places have been here, memories buried deep in the stone. You feel the age of the land, its harmony — but you know great disharmony got them here, to this moment.
I feel as if I’ve been here before. I haven’t — but it feels that way, a kind of in-between reality, a memory I didn’t know I had and the newness of the place pressing up against one another.
What is the place of memory in a story, any story? What is the place of memory in a life? What constitutes memory?

I lived in Paris for a year as an exchange student, and have developed a huge affection for the city; not least the food on offer.
I’m confident that if you’re here for a short city break, you’ll find your own favourite bakery, creperie, and café, and there are countless lists of wonderful restaurants that will cost more than €50 a person, so look elsewhere for your treat meals!
Here is a list of places I’ve been to more than once, and can always count on.
For fondue, go to Pain, Vin, Fromages (3 Rue Geoffroy l’Angevin). You must reserve, as it’s only open for a limited dinner service. Get the Méridionale which is a standard fondue with mixed herbs, and if you eat meat go for the bourguignonne which is cubes of steak that you cook at your table with a delectable salad.
For a cheap French brasserie experience go to Bouillon Chartier (7 Rue du Faubourg Montmartre). The wait staff are comically rude, but you’ll pay something like €1 for a soup and less than €15 for a delicious fish dish. Get the salade frisée aux lardons I don’t know what they put in the dressing but I’d take shots of it if I could.
For an unusual lunch, try Jyujiya (46 Rue Sainte-Anne) in the Japanese district. They claim to be the first to bring Japanese bentō to Paris, and they’re stunningly authentic and really good value for money. Save room to get a treat at Aki (same street) which does incredible Franco-Japanese desserts. The matcha melonpan is just perfect.
For a slightly more upmarket and significantly smaller scale bistro experience than Chartier, then try Le temps des cerises (31 Rue de la Cerisaie). If you see Café Gourmand on a desert menu in France then it’s usually worth getting — it’s typically a selection of small portions of the place’s best desserts served with coffee. Here it is a must try. French onion soup (here they just call it onion soup!!!!!) is also to die for.
For a very French fast food, try King Marcel (various locations). Fries and sides are weak, and to be honest it’s not my favourite style of burger at all. But it’s very high quality, and not a style of big thick burger I’ve found elsewhere. The bun is arguably too delicious for its own good.

It was an evening like any other. My uncle Simplice gathered my brother, my two cousins and me around the fire that he often had us light after dark in the courtyard of his house. It was in August, during the school vacation period. I was about 8 or 9 years old, my cousin Vieux was the same age, while my little brother and my other cousin Papi were 5 or 6 years old. We had finished dinner and, as was often the case in many villages in Cameroon, the boys were invited to join the men to listen to tales full of wisdom and stories about the history of our ancestors, while the girls often stayed with the women. This separation, which was in no way reflective of the social hierarchy, dated back centuries. It was through these evenings that the wise men passed on their knowledge. Africa, for centuries, was a continent giving priority to oral culture, hence the importance of a griot, a word used for an older African tribal storyteller.
That evening, my uncle Simplice had shed his relaxed side that made him our favorite uncle. We all loved his dilettante side which made him one of the fiercest hunters in the village. He knew how to put you at ease when you had your baptism of fire in the initiation to hunting in the forest at night. That evening, we all looked at each other, as his serious and almost solemn appearance was so disconcerting. We weren’t used to seeing him like this. He opened the session as he often did with his singular cry.
 “Audience,” he urged. “Silence,” we responded in unison.
The custom was for this ritual to be performed three times. It concluded with “Do tell.” Only after that could the wise man start the story. That evening would not be like any other, my uncle warned us.
 “We are going to talk about the history of all Cameroonians, regardless of their tribe. It’s a common history that binds us,” said my uncle, who spoke in a Bantu dialect.
He had married my mother’s older sister and his village, Ekali II, was located about thirty kilometers from Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
My uncle, who was a teacher at the local high school, then spoke to us about colonization. The story was devoid of moral teachings, which often flooded the stories he had told us in the past. He used the word “white” to refer to the colonists. He explained to us that, for a long time, our ancestors had lived with the idea that white people were immortal. This was what the settlers had propagated, he said.
 “They said that their God had made them immortal. They had guns to kill us, while we had nothing. We ended up believing them. Guns were believed to be divine weapons to punish anyone who dared to rebel against them.”
 “And how did you discover that they were mortal?” I dared to ask.
 “At the end of the First World War,” he replied. “What happened was that some of our brave men were taken to Europe to fight in the war alongside white men. They saw them die. They then said to themselves that the white man could also die. The survivors came to tell what they had seen. Little by little, the way we looked at white people changed, but we had to wait until the end of the Second World War for the myth of the white immortal colonist man to finally evaporate.”
This awakening, which dates to the end of the 1940s, coincides with the exacerbated aspirations for independence in the colonies. One of the very first colonies to become an independent country was Ghana in 1957, followed by Guinea in 1958. The rest had to wait until the 1960s. Until today, we even speak of neocolonialism in certain countries, because the former colonial powers continue to pull the strings behind the scenes to put in power the president of their choice and to exploit the continent’s resources with the help of corrupt local elites.
For more than 30 years, I buried deep inside me the words from my uncle about the immortal colonist, as this image had horrible consequences for millions of Africans and for Africa in general, because it was a weapon to subjugate and enslave us. I preferred to look forward. But the past and its images caught up with me a few days ago during the exhibition “The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism,” currently on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
The Harlem Renaissance is undoubtedly the artistic expression of the chronicling of the modern daily life of black Americans by black Americans in the midst of the Great Migration, which corresponds to the period from the 1920s to the 1940s. During this period, many black Americans were leaving the rural, racist and segregated South for the North. The exhibition, which is a dive into the New Negro artistic movement, introduces us to painters, artists and intellectuals both known and unknown. Among these artists is the painter Archibald Motley, who lived, for a short period of time in Paris and in the south of France. In the text which accompanies Motley’s paintings, created during his French period, it is recounted that many Harlem Renaissance artists often stayed in Europe and more particularly in France, which was one of the European artistic centers of the time. This European passage was seen as “an essential part of their artistic training.”
The text also raises one of the biggest dichotomies between black Americans and black Africans. This sticking point is at the center of the discord that has fueled our disagreement for decades: “The artists associated with the New Negro movement also described feeling a sense of greater personal freedom in countries that, despite oppressive rule in overseas colonies, did not have legalized racial segregation within their own borders,” one of the texts reads.
This sentence suggests that the United States was, at the time, more racist than Europe, and particularly France. This is still repeated today by black Americans who visit Europe or live in France, let alone Paris. For them, France, like certain European countries, is less racist. This is entirely contrary to the daily experience of black Africans and other minorities, particularly Arabs, living in Europe.
I understand well that this sentence aims to summarize the experience of black Americans in France and beyond in Europe, where they were better received and, above all, seen as full human beings, whereas in their own country, they were perceived as subhuman.
Racial segregation was legalized and took the form of the Jim Crow laws which separated blacks from whites in transportation, housing, employment, education, bathrooms, hospitals, churches, prisons, funeral homes, cemeteries, etc. This “inferiorization” of black Americans was legitimized and made official by a decision of the Supreme Court in 1896. The famous decision of May 18, 1896 on Plessy v. Ferguson ruled that the State of Louisiana was entitled to classify Mr. Plessy among the “people of color” because of his one-eighth black blood and that Judge Ferguson could consequently prohibit him from accessing the wagons reserved for whites!
There was certainly no law rendering blacks and other minorities inferior in Europe, but in fact (and this is the European particularity) the racial hierarchy was omnipresent and still is today in a very subtle way. In the 1920s to 1940s, to which the Harlem Renaissance exhibition is focused, almost no country in sub-Saharan Africa was independent. Very few blacks lived in Europe and in France. France did and continues to do everything to hide the horrors of colonization. Just a small example that took place during the Harlem Renaissance period was the Thiaroye massacre, which took place in Senegal in December 1944.
In November 1944, France was being gradually liberated from the Nazi occupiers. After four years of war, 1,300 West African riflemen (Tirailleurs as they are often referred to) were repatriated by the French army to Thiaroye, in a military camp in the suburbs of Dakar. They were demanding payment of their captivity balances, as well as various bonuses which had not been paid to them. At dawn on December 1, gunfire broke out in the camp. The French army said it was a mutiny that it had to repress bloodily. However, many gray areas remain.
For several years, the official French position was that the “Thiaroye affair” was a “heavily armed rebellion and a hostage-taking” requiring a “response” with disastrous results. But in November 2014, the French President François Hollande on a visit to this Dakar suburb, said that France must “repair an injustice and salute the memory of men who wore the French uniform and on whom the French had returned their rifle.”
The Thiaroye massacre, according to historians, was the consequence of France’s decision to “whitewash” its troops by replacing riflemen from Senegal, Dahomey (present-day Benin), French Sudan (present-day Mali), Côte d’Ivoire, Oubangui-Chari (present-day Central Africa), Niger, Chad, Gabon and Togo, by ethnic French soldiers.
The Harlem Renaissance exhibition also celebrates artists like Joséphine Baker who became a superstar in France. The success of one black individual in no way erases the treatment received by many others. At the same time as Paris celebrated Baker, the remains of Saatje Baartman, a South African slave whose body had been dissected and cast, her brain, her genitals and her posterior preserved in formalin, were exhibited at the Musee de l’Homme in the same city of light.
Born in South Africa in 1789, Baartman was exhibited as a human monster in Europe, notably in London and Paris. She was the first modern freak. She had been nicknamed the “Hottentot Venus” for her atypical physique. The name already constitutes a testimony to the way Europeans viewed black Africans. Venus refers to the Greek goddess of beauty, but was used here to mock her body which Europeans found disproportionate due to its exuberant forms which visitors fiddled with like an animal. “Hottentot” refers to her origin (she was from the Khoikhoi or Hottentot tribe).
The famous French zoologist Georges Cuvier, who was responsible for dissecting her body after her death in Paris in 1815, had concluded that she belonged to the same species as the white race, but that did not prevent him from classifying her at the very bottom of the human scale, barely above the chimpanzee and the orangutan. A place that the Hottentots shared with the Bushmen, the Pygmies, the “Caribbeans” and the Australian Aborigines.
What is striking in Motley’s paintings in Paris, is that the bars and cafés are full of white people, an indication of the place of black people in French society. That hasn’t changed much today. We are considered second-class French citizens. Racial discrimination is subtle but pervasive. Renting an apartment in a large French city is a challenge when you are black African or Arab; finding work that matches your level of education and abilities is also a challenge. No minority is running a large French company. Young minority graduates are forced to go into exile to find work that matches their level of education and skills.
How many blacks and Arabs live in Paris? The presence of black Africans and Arabs in tourist places and neighborhoods is an illusion. They don’t live there. For a long time, part of the 18th arrondissement of Paris, towards Barbès-Château Rouge, was the landmark and meeting point for black Africans. Black Africans could buy products imported from Africa there. While the market remains and black Africans are still present, almost none live there because of gentrification.
Before declaring Paris and France as less racist, black Americans would benefit from taking a quick trip to the suburbs around Paris, where minorities are segregated. Seine Saint Denis, which is one train stop from Paris, would give you an example of the true living conditions of blacks and Arabs in France. Basically, ten minutes by train, getting off at Stade de France, will allow you to really see France in its true light. When you are a black African or Arab, police checks are part of your daily life, as are racist clichés.
The latest controversy in France: French pop star Aya Nakamura, who is of Malian origin but grew up in the Paris suburbs, doesn’t really speak French to sing at the opening ceremony of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, say the right and the far-right. A rumor spread that the singer, currently the best known outside French borders, would sing in the ceremony. She immediately received numerous racist insults, simply because she mixes dialects, from foreign languages, with French in her music.
 “You can be racist but not deaf,” Nakamura responded on Twitter on March 10. “What do I really owe you?”
73% of French people think that Nakamura does not represent “French” music, according to a poll, while 63% oppose the idea of her headlining at the opening ceremony. This says a lot about the state of racism in France.
For black Africans, north Africans (Algerians, Tunisians, Moroccans) and other minorities, racism is our reality in France and Paris. Black Americans are seen as American visitors. White France’s relationship with them is different from what it is with us. It goes back to General Charles de Gaulle, the French hero of the Second World War, who always wanted to distinguish France from the United States, by offering an alternative to the American model in the world stage. Seen from this angle, welcoming black Americans who are ostracized in their country is a form of affront to the American rival. Except that, in reality, France does not treat its blacks and minorities very differently.
I asked some of my black American friends why they had this impression that France was less racist.
 “The only thing that comes to mind is that many [African Americans] are just unfamiliar with French history,” my black American friend Bruce replied.

The problem with Paris is not that it’s a living cliché, but that it isn’t one. That’s not to say that many ideas about the city don’t have an element of truth. But the city is so big and contains so many multitudes that it can be tiring to challenge them all the time.
When I think about my life in Paris, I would say that many of the ideas about the French capital that get perpetuated online feel so distant from my reality. It’s almost like they belong to another city entirely — one that doesn’t exist anywhere on Earth.
But just writing about the problem with stereotypes isn’t always that helpful. So today I thought I would take you on a photo walk just to give you another side of Paris — one that tourists seldom see.
We’re in the 19th arrondissement in the north-east of the city, which is about as far removed from Postcard Paris as you can get. It’s the kind of neighbourhood that you’d never see in Emily in Paris, for the simple reason that it’s not particularly glamorous. When a show is about projecting a fantasy, a place like this would only counter the narrative.
There’s no denying that the 19th arrondissement is one of the poorer areas of the capital. But that doesn’t mean that it doesn’t…

There were a few places I went during my holiday in Paris. Practically they were not museums, but the visiting experience was worth being noted.
The free entry was included in my Go Paris card, and I was intrigued by the description mentioning the final days of Marie-Antoinette, so I stepped into the old prison. I didn’t have really high hopes as I saw some photos online, and I wasn’t impressed. However, one small thing was a real game changer.
The Histopad!
I am not too keen on incorporating technology in museums as part of the tour. It doesn’t sound sensible and I know how I sound: Not everyone can “appreciate” or “learn” with traditional method, which is purely visual observation. Technology like AR (augmented reality) VR (virtual reality) to me are distractions, and I feel like they sometimes lack the profoundness, i.e. content, and therefore they are more like tokens or trophies.
However, if I hadn’t toured the Concierge with the Histopad, I would have left with great disappointment. There were pods around the place where people scanned them with the pads, which initiate the augmented reality of what could the place look like in the 15th century. The animation was made fine and it really provided a lot more information on the historical context, such as the people who dined, walked, how they dressed, etc.. What I liked the most was the hidden treasure that visitor could collect if they really aimed to click every possible button in the AR. I managed to find 5 out of 6, failing to find the last one. I was a bit bummed because I was very curious to learn what prize I could have!
2. Musée Parfum — Fragonard
I visited this place because as part of my Go Paris card deal, there was a mini workshop provided by the Fragonard Perfume Museum where tourists could make their own perfume. A few months prior to the visit, I finished reading the book, : Elixir: A Story of Perfume, Science and the Search for the Secret of Life, by Theresa Levitt. The name Fragonard was mentioned multiple times, as he was an important figure not only in the perfumery business, but also in the history of chemistry.
www.amazon.co.uk
Unfortunately I didn’t take any picture during the quick guided tour after the workshop. It was basically a brief look at the history of the Fragonard brand, including the classic best-seller smell and the design of the bottles.
I had a great impression on the visiting experience: It was hands-on, multi-sensory (the whole museum and shop smelled amazing), and the environment was beautifully designed. What I want to highlight is that this is another type of museum — Corporate/Brand museum.
dotdotdot-it.medium.com
I once joked with friends that there should be a law or policy that regulates what places could call themselves “museums”, which is a term frequently used by private collectors, hoarders, and people with niche interests. I’m not putting the term museum on a high altar; instead, I want museums to follow standards so audience could have an appropriate expectation when they step into a place that is labelled “museum”. Standards should include: If the collections on display are sourced ethically; if the display is from one single private collector; and if the place is funded by a publicly-known corporate and brand.
If a museum is about the history and archival perspective of a corporate, it is highly possible used as a white-washing front, distracting or misguiding the public from truth and creating a parallel narrative. A museum should be a place where voices of different backgrounds are curated to reflect the public and the community, and if any exhibition or institution fails to do so, they should not be called a museum but a display.
3. Paris Catacombs
I wasn’t aware of the catacombs until an advertisement popped up on my social media feeds. A walk among the deads’ bones? Yes! Within a heartbeat I booked myself a visit to it.
It was a well oriented and executed place with many signs of direction. The audio guide provided painted a great picture of the history and how the catacomb was conserved in modern times. For some, the environment definitely was spooky, but I was really happy to learn how the dead was treated in history.
!! Attention!!
Pictures of human remains. Readers’ discretion is advised.
A minor thing worth noting is that there would be staff checking visitors’ bags to prevent people smuggling the bones and skulls.

My time in Paris during the Olympics was filled with the odd, the ironic, and the sublime.
I had my first bad meal in Paris, and it briefly crushed my spirit. Like many people, I have long romanticized this city whose history and magic are etched in literature and film. “There are only two places in the world where we can live happy: at home and in Paris,” Ernest Hemingway said.
Dozens of famous quotes profess such homage, none more succinct than Maurice Chevalier’s character in the 1958 film Gigi asking incredulously, “Leave Paris?” Audrey Hepburn got to the point: “Paris is always a good idea.” Victor Hugo put it more eloquently in his 19th-century novel Les Misérables: “To breathe Paris preserves the soul.”
This is the beguiling image travelers bring when they visit Paris, and the city generally delivers. Fashion windows are more inviting than in New York or London. The storefronts dare you not to linger. Stunning centuries-old architecture fills the frame in every direction. Surely that is part of what Hugo breathed in.
Even the city’s graveyards boast elegance with a literary flair. Père Lachaise Cemetery is the final resting place of poets and artists from Chopin to the famously troubled Doors frontman Jim Morrison, whose tomb bears Greek words that approximate “the one who fights his demons.”

Perhaps the most potent problem of our modern era is its obsession with nostalgia. In its least malignant form, nostalgia becomes an excessive love of art and fashion playfully removed from the socio-political conditions of its creation. In its most malignant form, nostalgia turns people into cult-like fascists who desire a return to a time that never really existed. Most nostalgia travelers rest somewhere between: fantasizing about going back to something that felt more familiar, even at the expense of the present. And then there’s Midnight in Paris (2011), which seems to relish in misery, imagination, and nostalgia at varying points and for varying purposes. What ultimately does the film say about nostalgia, then?
Midnight in Paris follows Gil (Owen Wilson), a Hollywood script doctor disgruntled by the artlessness of his work, who visits Paris with his fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents, all wealthy socialites. Utterly in love with the city and its Modernist past, Gil fantasizes about moving there to make an honest go at becoming a novelist, much to the chagrin of Inez, who cannot fathom a life outside of the United States. They eventually run into the horrifically pedantic Paul (Michael Sheen) and his wife Carol (Nina Arianda) and are coaxed on several sightseeing trips. In frustration, Gil wanders Paris…

Sweet and sour stories about expat and immigrant life.

Yesterday I phoned one of my dear friends. She is French, but she moved to Madrid 3 years ago.
We talked about our lives, about how she does not have the time to fully learn Spanish, and how difficult it is to make local friends without speaking the language.
It made me think about my « débuts » in France.
I came to Paris when I was 19 years old to study law. I thought I would stay a year or two to change from Austria, but here I am, 17 years later.
Today, I would like to share my story about being an adult expat, the difficulties I faced and how to overcome them.
I grew up with the idealized image of Paris, which we see in the movies and cartoons — the city of lights and love, with happy people full of wonders and artists.
I am half embarrassed to say that even at the age of 19, I almost thought things in Paris were the way they were shown in the cartoon Anastasia: happy people dancing around the city on the pavements and going up the Eiffel Tower to scream their joy of being French.
Let me burst your bubble right now, and I am sorry for that: Paris might be the city of arts, lights, and love, but it is definitely not full of joyful people. Quite the opposite, to be honest.
It is a wonderful place to visit, and it is one of the most beautiful cities I have seen so far. Starting to live here, though, was a challenge, and still is sometimes.
French people are known for loving good food, good wine, and… complaining. It is not a legend, a true French will always find something to be unhappy about: politics, weather, wages, the food, the wine, the prices, the subway, the trains, the airplanes… You name it. If you watch the international news, you might know France is also the country of strikes.
Let me summarize the French art of striking: for the last 77 years (even more, but we lack archives), the national railway company called SNCF has been striking, mostly every summer and Christmas holiday every year. Yes, you read it the right way. Every year. For the last 77 years.
I must admit I find this art of being constantly unhappy quite charming, at least sometimes. Unless it impacts my daily life, which will then become the moment when I hate living in France. I suppose after 17 years, I became a bit French myself and adopted the unhappy philosophy!
Now, let us imagine you are an expat in France; you try to adapt. Is it hard? Yes and no. At least in Paris, the capital, people are used to foreigners, so they will not be shocked. But that does not mean they will accept you with open arms right away.
The first difficulty you would encounter is the language. French is not the easiest language to learn, and to grasp the French accent is quite difficult. Of course, you could just learn to speak it without trying to imitate the French accent. You could even become bilingual in French over the years, like I did; but do you think that would be enough?
After 17 years, I still get jokes and comments on my accent, although I am bilingual. I studied law at the Sorbonne, and I practiced as a lawyer for several years, so you can imagine I even know very technical terms an average French would not know. Without the perfect accent, all that does not count.
To my despair, it is the only country I know of where you make an effort to speak the language, and people will criticize your efforts instead of being happy.
While many appreciate your efforts, others will comment on your accent or correct your grammar — perhaps because they love their language so much they can’t resist pushing you toward perfection.
Finding true friends is challenging, too, as in every country. It was easier when I was a student, of course, but I learned that there is no age to find new friends. It is always possible. The secret?
Do something you love — join a class, an association, or a group related to your passion. You’ll find that French people are much more welcoming when you share common interests, even if you’re not fluent in French.
It seems contradictory, I know, but the thing is, a French will not make too much effort for a complete stranger, but if you want to join a group, things change. Just pick your passion and go for it!
Now that we have mentioned the less-than-happy parts of living here let’s get to the interesting part: Why come to France?
First of all, food and wine. It might sound cliché, but living here, or even visiting for a couple of days, opens new perspectives and changes your way of visualizing eating. For French people, food is sacred, so even the lunch breaks are quite long compared to other countries. Eating a sandwich in front of your computer is not the norm here.
People love enjoying the food, and it’s contagious. Before you know it, you will eat with your eyes before eating with your mouth. You will start enjoying every bite. You will start looking for new ideas for your cooking. You will start enjoying eating and tasting different foods. And thus, you will start enjoying life itself.
As for the wine, you will not find a better country to learn about it, taste it, and want to become an expert.
Living in Paris will also open your cultural chakras. Many artists and writers have found inspiration in this city. I could walk for hours around Paris without even noticing it; every street is worth the while. So many different cultural and fashion events take place in Paris, we never get bored.
My favorite neighborhood is the 5th arrondissement*. Hemingway used to live there, on the Rue Mouffetard, which is also my favorite street in Paris (and one of the oldest, too). You can find Gallo-Roman ruins, beautiful old churches, the Pantheon, and many other things in this arrondissement. It is also a student hideout because of its proximity to the Sorbonne.
If you ever visit the city, do not miss it!
It is always beneficial to try to understand the local culture. If you can get help doing so, it would be even better. I never thought I would change my career path the way I am planning to, but here I am today, hesitating to propose coaching services to expats who come to France.
It took me years to really start grasping the complexity of French culture and… bureaucracy. It also took a Master’s in law to better understand how to navigate the administrative system. From opening the first bank account to finding a school or nanny for the kids, it is quite the journey for an expat. It is also difficult to find people speaking enough English to really help you.
I will always preach the benefits of having help when moving to a new country because I suffered a lot of isolation and lack of proper communication during my different expat experiences.
To finish, here is a list of important things to know, even as a tourist. The « dos » and « don’ts » are quite a few, so I will write another article about the topic.
In the meantime, keep in mind:
Adapting to life in Paris was challenging at first, but the city has a magic that always draws you in — even when times are tough. Over the years, Paris has taught me to slow down, savor the moment, and enjoy life. And I’m still learning every day.
Please let me know in the comments if you have visited Paris or planning to do so. I would love to hear about your experience!
* arrondissement is the translation of « districts »

Every now and then, I’ll see an image of the Eiffel Tower or Notre Dame, and I will think about going to Paris again. Or I’ll think about some great work of art at the Louvre that I missed my first time around that I want to see in person.
But, if I’m being honest with myself, I don’t think I could bring myself to go back. It happens to many travelers, where one bad experience in a city or country ruins their impression of it. This is also not a case of Paris Syndrome because I did not go in thinking I would be dazzled by the city.
I visited Paris on the last leg of my student trip in 2019. We had spent a week in Ireland, Scotland, and England. We had the option of a two-day extension in Paris, so I figured I would not be another country off my list. In hindsight, we should have just flown home after London.
The trouble started after we left the train after crossing the Chunnel (I’ll admit that was cool). After meeting the van to take our luggage to our hotel, we took the metro to the Louvre.
The cars were packed, so we were squeezed in. A group of young men got on while we were boarding. However, they hopped off right when the doors were about to shut. The doors closed, and one of the…

I spent two years in Paris after I graduated from college. Those years were some of the most important, eye-opening, formative years of my life. I fell in love with a city. I fell in love with a people. I fell in love with a way of life that I wish everyone could experience.
So you can imagine my surprise when I occasionally run into Americans who tell me that they have visited Paris and, “It just didn’t do it for them.”
Poppycock!
If Paris “didn’t do it for you,” then you’re either too stuck in your own way to enjoy a culture that runs so contrary to your own, or… you simply didn’t do it right.
That city is a treasure. It lives up to all the hype of how it is portrayed in pop culture, and I promise it will steal your heart if only you’d let it.
If you haven’t been to Paris and you’re thinking about taking a trip, the best thing you can do is not listen to the people who found it underwhelming because, as I’ve already mentioned, they don’t know what they’re talking about.
The other thing you can not do is look on Yelp or similar sites for the most popular things to do in Paris, because, again, I can promise you that the most popular activities by tourists’ standards are not the best activities by the city’s standards.
Instead, listen to me, an ex coffee-drinking, bonjour-saying, cigarette-smoking, jazz-listening Parisian (yeah, I’m the real deal) who can show you the way to get the absolute most out of your trip.
For the first year that I spent in Paris, I took the metro everywhere, which certainly has its benefits, especially if you’re interested in the Parisian quotidian (daily life).
The second year, I bought myself an old road bike and used that as my daily commuter. And that, my friends, was the single most important lifestyle change I could have made.
Paris is a city full of hidden gems that you will not see from an underground metro or through the window of a speeding cab. Its architecture and bustling life that stretches from cafe to cafe should not be missed.
Riding a bike around the city is a great way to stumble upon little neighborhoods and scenes that you ordinarily never would have come across. Instead of wasting the time in between destinations watching a drunk homeless man curse on the metro, you are getting a more complete view of the city.
Paris also has a bike culture unlike anything we have in The United States except for maybe in New York. Many of the citizens commute to work in full professional attire by bike, and because of that, the city is quite cyclist-friendly with things like protected bike lanes lining every road.
So, if you’re comfortable on a bike, go rent one and see the city as it should be seen. It’s cheaper than the metro or an Uber and it’s a fantastic way to help digest those extra croissants that you will undoubtedly be eating.
Of all the must-see tourist sites in Paris, the Montmartre neighborhood is by far the most efficient, romantic, and Parisian.
If you feel the need to go see the Eiffel Tower up close or walk along the Champs-Elysee, then, by all means, go right ahead. But I promise that those places are populated exclusively by other tourists and hucksters whose profession is ripping off those very tourists.
Montmartre is also full of tourists, but it’s got a latent “Frenchness” about it that you won't find standing under the Eiffel Tower. It’s the neighborhood where the famous painters of old spent their days mastering their crafts. Romantic sentiments of that time still linger in those streets. One half expects to find Manet with a pipe, easel, and glass of absinthe musing over a dusk glow that is perhaps too complicated to capture in oil.
The narrow, cobblestone streets and fantastic little restaurants are nostalgia-fueled, giving you the feeling that you are walking around sometime in the early 20th century. It’s magical.
The bonus is that if you can make it up to the top of the hill to see Sacre Coeur Basilica, you’ll be privy to the best view in the city (granted it’s a clear day).
I’ve always said that when you go to Paris you shouldn’t try and see the sites, but instead you should try and see the neighborhoods. Sacre-Coeur is great but the Montmartre neighborhood is what will really steal your heart.
Place de Bastille is great, but Le Marais is what will really, really steal your heart. This neighborhood is probably my favorite in the city. It is huge, full of unbelievable restaurants and cafes, art galleries, and probably the best shopping in France.
Parisians tend to stay away from areas that are saturated with tourists, but Le Marais is an exception. Yes, there are hordes of foreigners walking around asking for directions, but there are also plenty of citizens who go there for lunch, to drink, or just to buy clothes and hang out in a park.
If you can find a way to get lodging in Le Marais, your trip will already have a huge leg-up. If I were visiting Paris today, I would probably spend the better part of a day (or maybe two) exploring Le Marias.
Go find the renowned falafel restaurants, stumble upon a trio playing gypsy jazz music, or just sit in a cafe and watch the characters walk by.
I think everyone visiting Paris should walk by the Louvre because, from the outside, it is as magnificent as anything else you will see. The Tuileries Gardens that lie just outside are also an exceptional use of your time.
On the inside, it’s a different story. It is one of the biggest museums in the world and virtually impossible to see in one day. Many of its hundreds of rooms are full of historical artifacts among which you will almost certainly get lost.
Hot take: the Mona Lisa is wildly underwhelming. Yeah, I said it.
So if you’re planning on doing a massive museum excursion in Paris I think your time would be much better spent at Musee D’Orsay. Situated just down the bank from Notre Dame, Musee D’Orsay is home to a much more palatable collection of paintings.
Being a fan of impressionism and its closely related movements, I found D’Orsay to be far more impressive than The Louvre. It’s also quite a bit smaller which allows you to actually consume the whole thing at once and without getting lost (the layout is logical and easy).
Also, to be honest, I like D’Orsay because it doesn’t have miles of historical artifacts that are undoubtedly exciting but serve to just get in the way when I really just want to look at art.
Other museums I prefer over The Louvre are the Centre Pompidou and the Musée Picasso.
You’d waste your trip if you didn’t stop at one of Paris’s many gorgeous parks, the best of which is Buttes-Chaumont.
When you walk into Buttes Chaumont you will quickly forget that you are in the middle of a large, urban city. Trees, swans, a pond, and a jutting cliff with a gazebo are all features of the park that make it unique and beautiful and that is why it is my pick for the best park in Paris.
No city loves a good picnic more than Paris. It is common to find young and old alike sprawled about on blankets drinking wine and eating baguettes with cheese against the backdrop of this sloping, tree-covered park. I encourage you to do the same.
Another neighborhood in which you will want to spend a considerable amount of time is the Latin Quarter/St. Germain. This wonderfully French neighborhood sits just on the south side of the Seine river and is chock-full of things to do.
The Latin Quarter was to writers what Montmartre was to painters. It’s got an implicit feeling that great art was (and maybe still is) created here.
This is another area that doesn’t necessarily have one thing to see (aside from Notre Dame, of course), but instead is something that you will just want to take in. Park your bikes and just stroll along the maze of narrow roads that lead to scenes of street jazz waiting to be discovered.
Also found in this area is The Jardin de Luxembourg, Shakespeare and Co. bookstore, and a handful of fantastic arthouse movie theatres for all the cinephiles.
There is not a doubt in my mind that you will eat good food while you are in Paris; it’s impossible not to do so.
Yet I would encourage you to save at least one meal for a style of restaurant known as a Bouillon.
These restaurants are traditionally French in every aspect: they serve classic French cuisine, the staff is outfitted in the typically French white shirt and black tie, and the tables are all close together so you get that real up-close and personal feeling that the French love.
My favorite bouillon is Bouillon de Pigalle (in the same neighborhood as Moulin Rouge), but you can find them scattered all over the city.
This is where you will find a menu dedicated to escargot, traditional style entrecote (steak), and a wine list that reaches the floor. Nothing will make you feel more French than spending an afternoon in a bouillon.
If there’s one thing that Paris takes seriously, it’s the consumption of alcohol. So it’s no surprise that amongst the variety of fun bars to choose from, Paris is also home to an array of speakeasies scattered about the city.
For those of you who don’t know, a speakeasy is a drinking parlor that was used during prohibition to covertly consume alcohol free from the scrutiny of the law. Nowadays, these parlors of old have become popular, trendy watering holes for cocktail aficionados and nostalgic drinkers (like myself).
My favorite of the Parisian speakeasies is a place called Lavomatic which masquerades as a laundromat. Customers are allowed entry by a security guard who doesn’t immediately give the location of the entrance, leading first-timers to explore the laundromat for hidden buttons and doors.
Once inside, you are surrounded by a small, dimly lit lounge with swings for seats and low ceilings. The atmosphere is romantic and the cocktails are innovative and delicious. Oh, and they get you drunk.
Other speakeasies to try out are The Little Red Door and The Moonshiner, which is hidden somewhere in the back of a popular pizza restaurant.
My final piece of advice for seeing Paris is to try and be French.
Americans are always complaining about how rude the French are and how they hate tourists from the United States invading their capital city.
The truth is, and I can tell you this for sure, most Parisians don’t hate Americans but they certainly do not appreciate when Americans come to France and bulldoze their culture.
So trying to be French doesn't mean mocking their culture but instead accepting it. Here’s a shortlist of some of the ways you can start becoming French.
Not only are little things like this much appreciated by the citizens, but they should also be the cornerstone of a good vacation. In order for one to gain the most from exploring another culture, one should be ready and willing to leave their own culture at the door and really soak everything in properly. I think if more Americans traveled with these considerations in mind, we might be well on our way to shaking the negative stigmatization of “The American Tourist.”
Paris is one of the most magnificent cities on the planet and it breaks my heart every time someone tells me they visited and didn’t really enjoy themselves. It has so much to offer if you’re looking in the right place, and it is my sincere hope that the suggestions given above can help as many people as possible enjoy the full Parisian experience, and thus expand their worldview.

One of the things that fascinates me the most about the 1870–1871 Siege of Paris is what still remains of it. Not really anything large-scale, despite the fact that so many historical events happened during or (at least partially) because of it.
Rather, physical remnants of the Siege are memoirs, photos, works of art, and some unexpected small relics, including a stuffed pigeon, secret letter holders, and old bread.
This past weekend, on Saturday, April 9th, I was invited by Bill & Rosa’s Book Room, one of my favorite used English bookstores, to do a presentation on the Siege of Paris and then a reading from Hearts at Dawn.
I was excited to share things about a moment in history that fascinates me and that’s little-known, even in the city and suburbs where it happened. But I have to admit, I was also a little nervous!
In the end, the presentation seems to have gone well. The crowd was warm and welcoming and had a lot to share and ask…
…unfortunately, the recording I tried to make was the only thing that didn’t go well. Between what seemed to be issues with lighting, as well as cutting off after a certain number of minutes to transition to another video, and then cutting off entirely after a while (to be fair, the presentation was longer than I’d expected), I came away with only some of that moment on my phone.
Those who are fans of the ephemeral would probably say that this is how it should be, but as the theme of my presentation shows, I kind of like holding onto things, for better or for worse.
My husband, a tech wizard in my eyes, was able to convert the bad video to audio, and then we worked to put images to it, when they were referenced or used in the presentation.
We created a podcast, of sorts, although the audio isn’t quite podcast-level.
We were able to save more or less the entire presentation, but unfortunately lost the introduction by the Book Room’s lovely, kind Iasmina, as well as the Q&A and reading portions.
Here’s the video, if you’re interested in hearing more or less all of the presentation. It’s full of interesting facts about the Siege of Paris, and hopefully is a fun listen.
If you DO listen, please be sure to take a moment to watch the 21:29 minute marker — the text there covers an important phrase that was cut off, which explains why modern scholars consider September 19, 1870, to be the official start of the Siege of Paris. (It’s the day the last telegraph line was cut, cutting Paris off from the world in terms of transportation and communication with the outside world.)
Also, if you watch, you’ll see the images that I showed and referenced during the presentation. I will put all of their links and attributions after the video, and you can also find them in the description. To my knowledge, all images are either public domain, my property/copyright, or correctly attributed.
And now, without further ado, here’s the presentation embedded below, or you can follow this link to YouTube.
I hope you enjoyed if you watched! Special thanks to Bill & Rosa’s Book Room for hosting and providing cookies and crackers (not rats or cats!) after.

So many events, so little time.
Having gone through each event for an upcoming piece in The Guardian, I’ve compiled a viewing guide. Then I whittled it down from 10,000 words, focusing specifically on the following:
If you prefer things in spreadsheet form and would like to see more names and a few more details, knock yourself out.
I’ll be live-Threading a lot of the Olympics on Threads (duresport2) and will be doing some live commentary at The Guardian.
Let’s hit it …
All times Eastern and 24-hour time. Sorry.
Do you like men’s soccer and men’s rugby? Good, because two days before the Olympics officially start, that’s all we’ve got.
0900: Soccer, Argentina-Morocco (men). Two games start simultaneously to kick off the Olympics. Argentina’s roster is loaded.
1030: Rugby sevens, US men vs. France. Tough assignment right to start with.
***** EVENT OF THE DAY *****1500: Soccer, US men vs. France. The men’s soccer tournament at the Olympics is such a strange beast, with rosters compiled of players under age 23 aside from three “overage” players, all of whom have to be released by clubs that are often unwilling to release them. The USA roster isn’t bad, and the French roster could be better, so odds of a good result here are better than they would be if the full national teams were playing. (DMV interest: Kevin Paredes, Griffin Yow)
Take a peek at the underrated sport of team handball before the main fare begins.
At the end of the viewing day, you’ll get a look at one of the most intriguing teams at the Games, the revamped and reloaded US women’s soccer team.
0900: Rugby sevens, US men vs. Uruguay. Will the rugby team be the first US athletes eliminated from medal contention? The top two in each group plus the two best third-place teams advance to the quarterfinals; otherwise, they’ll be playing for ninth place.
1100: Soccer, Spain-Japan (women). Two teams with a reputation for technical and tactical sophistication face off.
1100: Soccer, Canada women vs. New Zealand. (Duke interest: Quinn, Canada)
1300: Soccer, Nigeria women vs. Brazil. (Duke interest: Toni Payne, Nigeria)
***** EVENT OF THE DAY *****1500: Soccer, US women vs. Zambia. An easy win? Don’t be too sure. Barbra Banda is tied for the NWSL lead in scoring with 12 goals in 12 games. The USA should win, but it won’t be easy, and it should be entertaining. (DMV interest: Emily Fox)
1400, Opening Ceremony: This should be interesting.
One thing to watch: The tennis schedule is massively malleable. We could get interesting pairings at any time.
If you’re up early, there’s a smorgasbord of early rounds in many events, starting with badminton at 2:30. The day begins in earnest at 4:30 with the first medal event of the Games.
0430: Shooting, mixed team air rifle. Shooting typically has the first medal awarded in the Summer Olympics, giving us a chance to turn the spotlight on a Matt Emmons (someone I’ve written about multiple times — he’s someone with a gift for looking on the bright side) or a Ginny Thrasher. US chances: 2% gold, 10% medal
0500, Gymnastics, men’s qualification. This is the first of three subdivisions on the day, and this is the one that includes the US team.
0500: Diving, women’s synchronized springboard. The US duo’s last names combine to read “Cook/Bacon,” which is a complete sentence. US: 8% gold, 27% medal
0830, Cycling, women’s road time trial. Both US entries are also competing in another discipline (Chloé Dygert, track cycling) or another sport entirely (Taylor Knibb, triathlon — according to my research, the first person to do two sports in one Olympics in this century). Dygert is the world champion. US: 26% gold, 55% medal
0935, Water polo, US women vs. Greece. One of the most dominant teams in international team sports hits the water. (That would be the USA. This team doesn’t get anywhere near the publicity that it should.)
***** EVENT OF THE DAY *****1100, Skateboarding, men’s street. Nyjah Huston, one of the highest-profile skateboarders ever, had a disappointing run in Tokyo. Jagger Eaton took bronze. They’re both back, along with Chris Joslin. US: 17% gold, 49% medal, 9% second medal
1300: Soccer, US men vs. New Zealand. (DMV interest: Kevin Paredes, Griffin Yow)
1300: Fencing, women’s epee semis/final (start 0400). US: 3% gold, 15% medal (DMV interest: Hadley Husisian)
1345: Field hockey, US women vs. Argentina (Duke interest: Leah Crouse)
1350: Fencing, men’s sabre semis/final (start 0400). Eli Dershwitz is the world champion. US: 17% gold, 53% medal, 6% second medal (Duke interest: Pascual di Tella, Argentina)
1442: Swimming, men’s 400 freestyle. US: 9% gold, 32% medal
***** STAR WATCH *****1452: Swimming, women’s 400 freestyle. Katie Ledecky is not the favorite, though she has the second-fastest time of the year. US: 45% gold, 98% medal, 7% second medal (DMV interest: Katie Ledecky)
1500, Basketball, Canada men vs. Greece. Giannis Antetokounmpo vs. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and a host of Canadian players with reasonably solid NBA credentials, including the one we’re highlighting because of alma mater ties. (Duke interest: RJ Barrett, Canada)
1500: Handball, France-Denmark (men). Because the US didn’t qualify for either handball event, I’m adopting European champion France, which beat Denmark earlier this year to claim that title. Last year, Denmark beat France to claim the world championship. And they’re opening against each other?
1534: Swimming, women’s 4x100 freestyle. US: 15% gold, 63% medal
1544: Swimming, men’s 4x100 freestyle. US: 35% gold, 94% medal
1600: Beach volleyball, Nuss/Kloth vs. Canada (women). Fun fact — Taryn Kloth is 6-foot-4. Kristen Nuss is 5-foot-6. They played together at LSU, then went to the pro ranks and took bronze at the world championships.
You have an assortment of events starting at 2:30 a.m. with badminton, once again, but you’ll want to be sure to be awake just before sunrise on the East Coast to see Simone Biles, Sunisa Lee and an absolutely loaded US women’s gymnastics team.
Keep an eye on defending gold medalist Lee Kiefer’s progress in fencing, then tune in at 1300 if she’s still going.
Overlapping with swimming — the US women’s soccer team gets a massive test. Overlapping with soccer — your beach volleyball world champions close out the competition day.
0500: Basketball: South Sudan men vs. Puerto Rico. Two countries that now have a rep for giving the US men a hard time. (Duke interest: Khaman Maluach, South Sudan)
***** STAR WATCH *****0540: Gymnastics, women’s qualification. First look at Simone Biles, Sunisa Lee and an absolutely loaded US team.
0810: Cycling mountain, women’s race. Haley Batten took bronze in the 2022 world championships. US: 7% gold, 25% medal, 2% second medal
1115: Basketball, US men vs. Serbia. First look at a great team that will have to face a lot of other great teams. (DMV interest: Kevin Durant; Duke interest: Jayson Tatum)
1300: Fencing, women’s foil semis/final (start 0330). Lee Kiefer is the defending gold medalist, the 2023 world championship bronze medalist, and the world’s top-ranked fencer. US: 14% gold, 73% medal
1300: Soccer, Nigeria women vs. Spain. (Duke interest: Toni Payne, Nigeria)
1430: Swimming, men’s 400 IM. Gold medalist Chase Kalisz returns. Silver medalist Jay Litherland does not, but Carson Foster took silver in the last world championship and has the fastest time of 2024. US: 44% gold, 90% medal, 47% second medal (DMV interest: Chase Kalisz)
1440: Swimming, women’s 100 butterfly. Gretchen Walsh and Torri Huske have the two fastest times this year. US: 31% gold, 75% medal, 22% second medal (DMV interest: Torri Huske)
***** EVENT OF THE DAY *****1500: Soccer, US women vs. Germany. Not convinced Zambia was a test for this team? This game will tell us a lot about where this team stands — and whether they’ll advance. (DMV interest: Emily Fox)
1500: Soccer, Canada women vs. France. A concurrent marquee matchup between North American and European powers. (Duke interest: Quinn, Canada)
1544: Swimming, men’s 100 breaststroke. Nic Fink has the №3 time of 2024. US: 28% gold, 70% medal, 3% second medal
1600: Beach volleyball, Hughes/Cheng vs. Czechia (women). Sara Hughes (obviously not the 2002 figure skater) and Kelly Cheng are the 2023 world champions.
Not the most eventful morning, but why not check out eventing? Then check on the men’s mountain bike race before watching a former NBA player taking the beach. The US men’s gymnasts are up after that with a legitimate medal shot. When they’re done, check out any of the US women’s teams in action and watch for another potential medal in fencing, but be sure to get to the pool to see the underheralded Ryan Murphy and the veteran Lilly King, the latter of whom got engaged at a cute scene at trials.
0500: Equestrian, team eventing final (jumping). US: 9% gold, 30% medal
0500: Basketball, Nigeria women vs. Australia. (Duke interest: Elizabeth Balogun, Nigeria)
0715: Field hockey, US women vs. Spain. Check in on a team that’s trying to return to the world elite. (Duke interest: Leah Crouse)
0810: Cycling mountain, men’s race. Riley Amos is ranked №1 in the world. US: 11% gold, 35% medal, 3% second medal
1000: Beach volleyball, Evans/Budinger vs. France (men). Yes, NBA fans — Budinger as in former hoopster Chase Budinger.
1130: Gymnastics, men’s team. The US men haven’t had the greatest success in recent Olympics, but this team took bronze in the last world championships. US: 11% gold, 35% medal
1300: Fencing, women’s sabre semis/final (start 0300). US: 3% gold, 14% medal (DMV interest: Tatiana Nazlymov)
1350: Fencing, men’s foil semis/final (start 0325). Nick Itkin took the silver medal in the 2023 world championships .US: 10% gold, 56% medal, 10% second medal
1430: Swimming, women’s 400 IM. Silver medalist Emma Weyant returns. Bronze medalist Hali Flickinger does not, but Katie Grimes took silver in the last world championship. US: 21% gold, 57% medal, 12% second medal
1440: Swimming, men’s 200 freestyle. US: 5% gold, 35% medal
1500: Basketball, US women vs. Japan: Honestly, the gap in talent between the USA and the rest of the world is so vast that these games will feel a bit perfunctory. But they did just lose to the WNBA All-Stars, so there’s something. (Duke interest: Chelsea Gray, coach Kara Lawson)
1519: Swimming, men’s 100 backstroke. Ryan Murphy is the returning bronze medalist. Better yet, he’s the 2016 gold medalist and the 2023 world champion. Hunter Armstrong took bronze in 2023. US: 62% gold, 98% medal, 37% second medal
1525: Swimming, women’s 100 breaststroke. Emma Weber and Tokyo bronze medalist Lilly King finished ahead of Olympic gold medalist Lydia Jacoby at the US trials, a testament to how tough it is to make the US teams in these marquee events. US: 25% gold, 71% medal, 10% second medal
1541: Swimming, women’s 200 freestyle. Katie Ledecky has given up her spot to Erin Gemmell. US: 16% gold, 35% medal, 2% second medal (DMV interest: Erin Gemmell)
The sun never sets on the 2024 Olympics, thanks to the decision to hold the surfing competition in Tahiti. That explains why the action runs so long today, well after midnight in Paris.
Things get real at 12:15.
0200: Triathlon, men’s individual. US: 2% gold, 9% medal. (Duke interest: Morgan Pearson)
0700: Volleyball, US men vs. Germany
0730: Basketball, Canada men vs. Australia. (Duke interest: RJ Barrett, Canada)
0930: Shooting, men’s trap. US: 14% gold, 33% medal, 3% second medal
0950: Fencing, women’s team epee (semifinals, then final; earlier round at 0730). US: 4% gold, 16% medal (DMV interest: Hadley Husisian)
1130: 3x3 basketball, US women vs. Germany
***** EVENT OF THE DAY *****1215: Gymnastics, women’s team. The US took silver last time when Simone Biles dropped out. She’s back, as are Suni Lee, Jordan Chiles and Jade Carey. This team won the world championship and is ready to reclaim Olympic gold as well. US: 49% gold, 90% medal
1300: Rugby sevens, women’s medal games. US: 10% gold, 32% medal
1300: Soccer, US men vs. Guinea. (DMV interest: Griffin Yow, Kevin Paredes)
1456: Swimming, women’s 100 backstroke. Regan Smith took bronze in Tokyo and silver at the world championships, where Katharine Berkoff took bronze. Smith has the top time in the world this year; Berkoff is third. US: 39% gold, 88% medal, 34% second medal
1502: Swimming, men’s 800 freestyle. Gold medalist Bobby Finke returns. He also took bronze in the 2023 world championship. US: 32% gold, 70% medal
1601: Swimming, men’s 4x200 freestyle. US: 15% gold, 62% medal
1635: 3x3 basketball, US men vs. Serbia
1748, Surfing, men’s individual: The US men were shut out in the sport’s Olympic debut. Seems unlikely that’ll happen in France … er, Tahiti. John John Florence and Griffin Colapinto are currently 1–2 in the World Surf League rankings; Florence took the title in 2016 and 2017. US: 27% gold, 68% medal, 18% second medal
1900, Surfing, women’s individual: Gold medalist and five-time World Surf League champion Carissa Moore is back for one last ride before retiring, at least temporarily, after the Games. (The lure of returning for 2028 in Los Angeles might be hard to resist, of course.) Caity Simmers and defending champion Caroline Marks are 1–2 in the World Surf League. US: 79% gold, 95% medal, 66% second medal, 22% sweep
Hannah Roberts rarely leaves a BMX competition without a gold medal, but that’s what happened in Tokyo, when Britain’s Charlotte Worthington became the first woman to land a 360-degree backflip in competition, earning MBE honors. A little while later, the US men’s gymnasts and the US women’s soccer team aim to make the most of their time in spotlight.
0200: Triathlon, women’s individual. According to my research (there will be a piece coming out about this), Taylor Knibb will become the first athlete to compete in two sports (not disciplines, like road cycling and track cycling) this century. US: 10% gold, 36% medal, 3% second medal
0500: Diving, women’s synchronized platform. Jessica Parratto and Delaney Schnell took silver in Tokyo and bronze in the 2023 world championship. US: 17% gold, 53% medal
***** EVENT OF THE DAY *****0710: Cycling BMX, women’s park. Five-time world champion Hannah Roberts took silver in Tokyo. US: 63% gold, 98% medal, 10% second medal
0715: Field hockey, US women vs. Australia. (Duke interest: Leah Crouse)
0844: Cycling BMX, men’s park. US: 11% gold, 36% medal, 3% second medal
0950: Fencing, men’s team sabre semifinals/final (earlier rounds at 0730). This team took bronze in the 2023 world championship. US: 10% gold, 49% medal
1100: Soccer, Nigeria women vs. Japan. (Duke interest: Toni Payne, Nigeria)
1130: Gymnastics, men’s all-around. Fred Richards took bronze in the 2023 world championship. US: 8% gold, 29% medal
1300: Soccer, US women vs. Australia. This one could determine whether this team advances to the quarterfinals. (DMV interest: Emily Fox)
1430: Swimming, women’s 100 freestyle. US: 8% gold, 28% medal (DMV interest: Torri Huske)
1436: Swimming, men’s 200 butterfly. US: 6% gold, 22% medal (DMV interest: Thomas Heilman)
1500: Basketball, US men vs. South Sudan. This matchup got a bit more interesting June 20, when the US men only beat South Sudan by one. (DMV interest: Kevin Durant; Duke interest: Jayson Tatum AND South Sudan’s Khaman Maluach, an incoming Duke recruit)
1500: Soccer, Canada women vs. Colombia. (Duke interest: Quinn, Canada)
***** STAR WATCH *****1507: Swimming, women’s 1,500 freestyle. Katie Ledecky has the 19 fastest times ever recorded in this event. Erica Sullivan took silver last time; this time, Ledecky’s teammate is Katie Grimes, who’ll also be competing in the 400 IM and the open-water 10k. US: 95% gold, 98% medal, 16% second medal (DMV interest: Katie Ledecky)
1530: 3x3 basketball, US women vs. Azerbaijan
1615: Swimming, men’s 200 breaststroke. Matt Fallon took bronze in the 2023 world championship and has the world’s top time this year. US: 19% gold, 59% medal, 3% second medal
1622, Swimming, men’s 100 free: Gold medalist Caeleb Dressel is competing in other events but not this one. Jack Alexy took silver in the last world championship and has the third-best time in the world this year. US: 22% gold, 63% medal, 9% second medal
1635: 3x3 basketball, US men vs. Poland
In Tokyo (and other parts of Japan), the USA was shut out in rowing and sailing. That doesn’t usually happen. Today, both teams get a shot at preventing a repeat, and the rowers have a good shot at succeeding.
Make no plans of any kind between noon and 3.
0430: Rowing, women’s double sculls. Sophia Vitas and Kristi Wagner took bronze in the 2023 world championship. US: 15% gold, 47% medal
0506: Rowing, men’s four. This group took silver in the last world championship. US: 18% gold, 58% medal
0700: 3x3 basketball, US women vs. Australia
0843: Sailing, men’s skiff (49er) medal race. US: 2% gold, 8% medal
0850: Fencing, women’s team foil semifinals/final (earlier rounds at 0550). US: 9% gold, 44% medal

It’s also the first day of track and field. Buckle up.

***** EVENT OF THE DAY *****1415: Cycling BMX, women’s race semis and finals. In Tokyo, reigning world champion Alise Willoughby crashed in the semifinals, and Felicia Stancil finished fourth.

0500: Cycling road, men’s road race. Matteo Jorgensen finished a solid eighth in the Tour de France while riding in service of Denmark’s Jonas Vingegaard. It’ll be interesting to see how he fares if he’s the person getting the help rather than giving it. US: 4% gold, 18% medal, 2% second medal
0500: Handball, France-Spain (women). I felt I should adopt France’s women’s team in addition to the men’s team, and this is the best chance to see them play.
0510: Rowing, men’s eight. US: 6% gold, 21% medal (DMV interest: Christian Tabash)
0600: Tennis, men’s doubles. Time approximate — it’ll be no earlier than this but could be much later. US: 10% gold, 29% medal

1508: Swimming, women’s 800 free. Katie Ledecky has the 29 fastest times ever recorded in this event, but Australia’s Ariarne Titmus was 0.06 seconds faster in her country’s Olympic trials than Ledecky was in hers. Ledecky still has the fastest time of the year. And the third. And fourth. And fifth. US: 90% gold, 98% medal, 8% second medal (DMV interest: Katie Ledecky)
***** EVENT OF THE DAY *****1520: Track and field, women’s 100. Sha’Carri Richardson, left off the team for Tokyo after testing positive for a cannabis-related substance, is the world champion. US: 36% gold, 76% medal, 14% second medal

0930: Shooting, women’s skeet. Gold medalist Amber English does not return, but Dania Vizzi took silver in the last world championship, and this is traditionally a strong US event. US: 20% gold, 58% medal, 8% second medal
0940: Gymnastics, women’s uneven bars. Sunisa Lee took bronze in this event in Tokyo. US: 10% gold, 32% medal, 3% second medal
1115: Basketball, US women vs. Germany. The first half is probably all you need to watch. (Duke interest: Chelsea Gray, coach Kara Lawson)

***** STAR WATCH *****0823: Gymnastics, women’s floor. The US team includes Olympic champion Jade Carey and world champion Simone Biles. That hardly seems fair. US: 72% gold, 97% medal, 32% second medal
0900: Shooting, mixed team skeet. Vincent Hancock and Austen Smith are the world champions. US: 24% gold, 45% medal, 3% second medal
1015: Canoe slalom, women’s kayak cross semis and final. The stats don’t justify a higher percentage chance, but this is a new event, and I’ve got a strange feeling that Evy Leibfarth might surprise here. US: 2% gold, 10% medal
***** EVENT OF THE DAY *****1130: 3x3 basketball, women’s semis/medal games. Two of the four players who won gold in Tokyo, Kelsey Plum and Jackie Young, are now on the traditional 5v5 basketball team.

US: 52% gold, 98% medal
1200: 3x3 basketball, men’s semis/medal games. Remember Jimmer-mania?

The US men didn’t qualify for the sport’s debut in Tokyo for complicated reasons. US: 25% gold, 79% medal
1200: Soccer, men’s semifinal. (DMV interest: Griffin Yow, Kevin Paredes)
1300: Track and field, men’s pole vault. Chris Nilsen followed up his silver in Tokyo with silver and bronze in the last two world championships. Sam Kendricks is the big comeback story here — after taking bronze in Rio, he won the next two world championships but missed the Tokyo Olympics after a positive COVID-19 test. US: 19% gold, 90% medal, 45% second medal (Duke interest: Simem Guttormsen, Norway)
1430: Track and field, women’s discus. Gold medalist Valarie Allman took bronze and silver in the last two world championships. US: 46% gold, 98% medal, 10% second medal

If you get up to watch Katie Grimes in her pursuit of an unusual double of medals in the pool and in the open water, you might want to take a nap after that. The rest of the morning has the second round of women’s golf, early rounds in taekwondo, some track and field heats (including parts of the heptathlon), and so on.
Starting at 2:30 p.m., we could see the US track and field athletes win four, five, six, maybe even seven or eight medals in less than 90 minutes. Noah Lyles leads the way in the men’s 200, the event with the best chance of a US sweep in my projections. Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone follows a little while later in the women’s 400 hurdles, and then Grant Holloway leads another potential US sweep in the men’s 110 hurdles.
Aside from that, it’s all semifinals, all the time: women’s water polo, women’s volleyball, women’s handball, men’s and women’s beach volleyball, men’s basketball, women’s water polo
0130: Swimming, women’s 10k open. Katie Grimes, who’ll have a few days to rest up for this after a full set of races in the pool, took bronze in the 2023 world championship. US: 9% gold, 29% medal, 3% second medal

(Watch a lot of team sports in the interim.)
1130: Basketball, men’s semifinal. (Duke interest: Jayson Tatum, USA; Khaman Maluach, South Sudan; RJ Barrett, Canada)
1235: Wrestling, men’s 86kg freestyle semis and women’s 57kg semis. My model is undercounting Aaron Brooks here because he hasn’t had many chances at this level. But he earned it by upsetting gold medalist and three-time world champion David Taylor, so it’s fair to say no one’s going to take him lightly. Helen Maroulis already has a metric ton of medals from international competition. Medal matches are tomorrow. (DMV interest: Aaron Brooks, Helen Maroulis)
1400: Track and field, women’s long jump. Silver medalist Brittany Reese does not return, but Tara Davis-Woodhall took silver in the 2023 world championships and has the second-best jump of the year. Jasmine Moore is right behind her. US: 21% gold, 66% medal, 9% second medal
1430: Track and field, men’s 200. Silver medalist Kenny Bednarek returns, but the heavy favorite is three-time world champion Noah Lyles, who took bronze in Tokyo. Erriyon Knighton took bronze and silver in the last two world championships. Lyles and Bednarek have the top two times this year. US: 79% gold, 99% medal, 84% second medal, 36% sweep (DMV interest: Noah Lyles)
1500: Basketball, men’s semifinal. (Duke interest: Jayson Tatum, USA; Khaman Maluach, South Sudan; RJ Barrett, Canada)
1525: Track and field, women’s 400 hurdles. Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone won gold in Tokyo, won the world championship in 2022, and broke the world record at the Olympic trials with a scorching time of 50.65. And she’s still not a sure thing for gold here because the Netherlands’ Femke Bol just broke the 51-second mark as well. US: 92% gold, 99% medal, 41% second medal, 4% sweep (DMV and Duke interest: Lauren Hoffman)
1545: Track and field, men’s 110 hurdles. You get the idea. It’s a huge night on the track. Grant Holloway took silver in Tokyo and has been dominant ever since, taking the last two world championships. Daniel Roberts took bronze in the 2023 world championship. Holloway, Freddie Crittenden and Roberts have the top three times in the world this year. US: 95% gold, 99% medal, 63% second medal, 14% sweep
1634: Boxing, men’s flyweight (51kg) final. Roscoe Hill took silver in the 2021 world championship. US: 17% gold, 54% medal
The morning will likely be slow aside from the sport climbing final, unless the US men are in the morning water polo semifinal. The men’s soccer final is at noon.
Then the dam breaks.
Go to the track at 1:30 for the 4x100 relays, which the USA often wins if they can remember to exchange the baton. While that’s going on, multiple US medal hopefuls start the women’s shot put.
But wait — we have the debut of a new Olympic sport. It’s breaking. The sport, that is — it’s called breaking, which many of us remember as breakdancing.
So check that out while hopping between the track and the wrestling mat, where Helen Maroulis aims to add yet another medal to her collection. You may even want to check out taekwondo.
And then we have the beach volleyball gold-medal match, which you’re free to watch for 45 minutes before checking out the track for a minute (a little less, actually) to see if perennial podium finisher Rai Benjamin can claim that elusive gold.
0130: Swimming, men’s 10k open. US: 1% gold, 5% medal
0415: Sport climbing, men’s combined. Colin Duffy took silver in the last world championship. US: 17% gold, 51% medal, 4% second medal
0835: Water polo, men’s semifinal.
1030: Handball, men’s semifinal.
1130: Basketball, women’s semifinal. (Duke interest: Chelsea Gray and coach Kara Lawson, USA; Elizabeth Balogun, Nigeria)
1200: Soccer, men’s gold-medal game. I have no idea what the USA’s chances are. They weren’t in the last Olympics, and there’s no other meaningful U-23 competition, so I had nothing to calculate. Also, when I did projections, we didn’t even have much of an idea who’d be on the roster. Wild guess: US 2% gold, 10% medal (DMV interest: Griffin Yow, Kevin Paredes)
1330: Track and field, women’s 4x100 relay. The USA is the reigning world champion and took silver in Tokyo. US: 41% gold, 95% medal

1345: Track and field, men’s 4x100 relay. The USA won this event at the 2023 world championships. Generally, if they can keep hold of the baton, they’re either first or second. US: 32% gold, 70% medal (DMV interest: Noah Lyles)
1400: Track and field, women’s 400. The legend Allyson Felix has retired. US: 9% gold, 32% medal, 4% second medal (Duke interest: Maddy Price, Canada)
1400: Breaking, women’s quarters, semis, finals. New event, though those of us of a certain age remember the breakdancing craze of the … 80s? 70s? Anyway, it’s a new Olympic sport. US: 10% gold, 33% medal, 2% second medal
1400: Field hockey, women’s gold-medal game. US: 1% gold, 5% medal (Duke interest: Leah Crouse)
1405: Wrestling, men’s 86kg freestyle medal matches. Reiterating from yesterday’s semis — Aaron Brooks upset gold medalist and three-time world champion David Taylor at the trials, and this is one case in which my mathematical model is surely underrating his chances. US: 3% gold, 13% medal (DMV interest: Aaron Brooks)
1415: Track and field, women’s heptathlon (final: 800m). Anna Hall has bronze and silver in the last two world championships and is ranked №1. US: 27% gold, 78% medal, 10% second medal
1434: Taekwondo, men’s 80kg medal bouts (start 0300). CJ Nickolas took silver in the last world championship. US: 17% gold, 54% medal
1450: Wrestling, women’s 57kg medal matches. What a career Helen Maroulis has had — gold medal in 2016, three world championships, seven world championship medals (most recently bronze in 2023) and a bronze medal in Tokyo. US: 35% gold, 79% medal (DMV interest: Helen Maroulis)
1500: Beach volleyball, women’s gold-medal match. You’ve already learned plenty about the US teams by now. There’s a chance this could be an all-USA final. US: 51% gold, 85% medal, 35% second medal
1500: Basketball, women’s semifinal. (Duke interest: Chelsea Gray and coach Kara Lawson, USA; Elizabeth Balogun, Nigeria)
1530: Boxing, men’s welterweight (71kg) final. Omari Jones took silver in the 2021 world championship. US: 9% gold, 30% medal
1545: Track and field, men’s 400 hurdles. Silver medalist Rai Benjamin returns. He also has taken two silvers and a bronze in the last three world championships, and he has the top time of 2024. US: 41% gold, 99% medal, 31% second medal
Get the caffeinated beverages ready and find a comfortable place to watch.
If you get up at 3:30 a.m., you can catch the end of the men’s marathon and check in on golf before watching sport climbing. Then it’s off to men’s volleyball and a quick check to watch Nevin Harrison defend her canoe gold medal.
After that, two major women’s finals in water polo and soccer. Side note: In 2008 in Beijing, I sat down in the press tribune and told my USA TODAY colleague Christine Brennan that the USA had no chance to win. Brazil blew them off the field the previous year at the World Cup. I was incorrect.
Then hop between the track and the wrestling mat, but be sure to catch the first-ever men’s breaking finals.
And then we have the potential for a classic men’s basketball final, but check the boxing ring to see if Jahmal Harvey is fighting for gold.
0200: Track and field, men’s marathon. US: 3% gold, 15% medal
0300: Golf, women’s final round. Defending gold medalist Nelly Korda has the №1 ranking in the world by a considerable margin. Lilia Vu is second. US: 25% gold, 88% medal, 41% second medal (Duke interest: Celine Boutier, France; Ana Belac, Slovenia; Leona Maguire, Ireland)
0415: Sport climbing, women’s combined. Brooke Raboutou, who comes from a family of distinguished climbers, took bronze in the 2023 world championships. US: 11% gold, 35% medal, 4% second medal
0700: Volleyball, men’s gold-medal match. The USA’s 10th-place finish in Tokyo was their worst Olympic result since 2000. They improved to sixth at the 2022 world championships and took bronze in the 2023 World Cup. US: 9% gold, 29% medal
0740: Canoe sprint, women’s 200m C1. Nevin Harrison is the defending gold medalist. US: 26% gold, 50% medal
0935: Water polo, women’s gold-medal game. You know about the dominant US women’s basketball team. You know the US women’s soccer team. With the last three Olympics and four of the last five world championships, the women’s water polo team more than holds its own by comparison. US: 72% gold, 98% medal
1100: Soccer, women’s gold-medal game. The USA was once a safe bet for the podium. In this competition, nothing would surprise me. They could win it all, or they could be knocked out in the group stage by Germany and Australia. US: 27% gold, 54% medal (DMV interest: Emily Fox, USA; Duke interest: Quinn, Canada; Toni Payne, Nigeria)
1235: Wrestling, men’s 97kg freestyle semis. (DMV interest: Kyle Snyder)
1310: Track and field, men’s high jump. JuVaughn Harrison made the Tokyo final in the high jump and long jump but is focusing on jumping vertically this time around. He took silver in the 2023 world championships and has the third-best jump of 2024. US: 20% gold, 57% medal, 10% second medal
1325: Track and field, men’s 800. US: 7% gold, 27% medal
1330: Wrestling, men’s 74kg freestyle medal matches. Bronze medalist and world champion Kyle Dake returns. US: 26% gold, 80% medal
1345: Track and field, women’s 100 hurdles. Silver medalist Keni Harrison didn’t qualify from a blazing-fast Olympic trials final, which Masai Russell won in 12.25 seconds. US: 9% gold, 34% medal (DMV interest: Masai Russell)
1400: Track and field, men’s 5,000. Bronze medalist Paul Chelimo does not return, but Athens Academy alumnus Graham Blanks will be there. (Hey, I have to shout out my high school.) US: 2% gold, 20% medal, 2% second medal
1400: Breaking, men’s quarters, semis, finals. Victor Montalvo, known by the mononym Victor, won the 2022 World Games and the 2023 world championship. US: 55% gold, 82% medal, 28% second medal
1405: Wrestling, men’s 125kg freestyle medal matches. Mason Parris took bronze in the 2023 world championship and will attempt to duplicate Gable Steveson’s feat of taking Olympic gold. US: 18% gold, 56% medal
1512: Track and field, men’s 4x400 relay. The USA is the defending Olympic and world champion. US: 77% gold, 98% medal
1522: Track and field, women’s 4x400 relay. The USA won gold in Tokyo. US: 57% gold, 85% medal (Duke interest: Maddy Price, Canada)
1530: Basketball, men’s gold-medal game. LeBron, Curry, Tatum, Edwards, Durant, Embiid, Holiday — could this team really lose? Yes, because France is monstrous. If those two teams are in the final, this could be a classic. US: 44% gold, 75% medal (Duke interest: Jayson Tatum, USA; Khaman Maluach, South Sudan; RJ Barrett, Canada)
1547: Boxing, men’s featherweight (57kg) final. Jahmal Harvey won the 2021 world championship. US: 35% gold, 78% medal (DMV interest: Jahmal Harvey)
It’s a slow morning — if you get up to watch the women’s marathon, your only options between that and the modern pentathlon are bronze medal games and fifth-place games in water polo and handball.
If the USA hasn’t placed any finalists in wrestling or women’s volleyball, consider sticking with track cycling. The first event of the women’s omnium is at 5:00, and Jennifer Valente is one of those athletes who should be more famous than she is.
After that, pick between gold-medal games in men’s handball (no US team involved) and men’s water polo (there’s a chance) before watching the last and surest bet for a US gold medal — the women’s basketball final.
Personally, I don’t watch the Closing Ceremony because it makes me a little sad that it’s over and we have to go back to reality. It’s at 2 p.m.
0200: Track and field, women’s marathon. US: 3% gold, 21% medal
0500: Modern pentathlon, women’s individual. Will this be the last Olympic pentathlon to include horses? They’ll switch to an obstacle course in 2028. US: 1% gold, 5% medal
0530: Weightlifting, women’s 81+kg. Mary Theisen-Lappen took silver in the last world championship. US: 14% gold, 44% medal
0600: Wrestling, men’s 65kg freestyle medal matches. Zain Retherford is the world champion. US: 28% gold, 58% medal
0635: Wrestling, men’s 97kg freestyle medal matches. Kyle Snyder is the defending silver medalist. US: 21% gold, 66% medal (DMV interest: Kyle Snyder)
0700: Volleyball, women’s gold-medal match. The US goes for a repeat. US: 34% gold, 74% medal
0730: Handball, men’s gold-medal game. Alas, no Iceland. No US entry
0756: Cycling track, women’s omnium final (points race). Gold medalist Jennifer Valente also won this event at the 2022 and 2023 world championships. US: 45% gold, 78% medal
0800: Water polo, men’s gold-medal game. US: 4% gold, 16% medal
0930: Basketball, women’s gold-medal game. Seven straight Olympic gold medals, from 1996 onward. Six of the last seven World Cups, from 1998 onward. The USA will likely grab the last available gold medal of the Games. US: 95% gold, 98% medal (Duke interest: Chelsea Gray and coach Kara Lawson, USA; Elizabeth Balogun, Nigeria)
1400: Closing Ceremony. Au revoir.

I originally read Paris France by Gertrude Stein in January 2020. I had heard of the book before and I finally got the chance to read it when I found it nestled amongst all of the other books that Yasmine gave me before she left Paris. It’s a collection of Stein’s observations on Paris, art, war, love, and more. She opens the novel with, “Paris, France is exciting and peaceful.” Stein published the novel in 1940 and yet the opening line really rings true with my own experiences in Paris lately.
In January, little did I know that Covid-19 would whip through Paris just a few months later. On March 17, we would be ordered to stay in our homes. We were allowed to leave, for up to 1-hour, to go grocery shopping, to the bank, or to the pharmacy. We were required to fill out forms called attestations if we did leave the house. It involved putting our addresses, birth dates, and reason for being outside. Then we had to sign and date it. If we were caught outside without an attestation there was a 135 euro fine.
To say that Paris felt different during the first national lockdown would be an understatement. In French, the lockdown was called le confinement, which translates to what you’d assume: confinement. And that’s what it felt like. We were truly confined to our homes. Paris itself was a ghost town and there was a definite eeriness to the city. It was so…quiet. Paris’ soul was closed: its bars, cafés, restaurants, museums, and parks were all shuttered up. There were no outdoor markets or museums. Half the city had fled to their second homes in the airy French countryside, and there were obviously no more tourists. It’s funny to say but I never really realized how much tourism runs this city. In the beginning, it was fun to explore my normally bustling neighborhood. I had never seen the area that quiet and empty. But after a while, the eeriness set in.
Much of my life (and for most Parisians) used to happen outside my apartment. That’s why it’s pretty normal to live in a small space here. My first apartment on my own was the size of some people’s walk-in closets but I didn’t mind. In fact, I loved it and ended up living in less than 100 square feet for 2.5 years. It didn’t matter to me that my bedroom, shower, and kitchen were all in the same space. I was away all day, either working or at school, and in the evenings I usually went out to see friends: for dinner, drinks, or just to go for a walk. I used my apartment to sleep in, shower in, and cook in. When I didn’t feel like going out it was the perfect place to spend a cozy evening in bed.
Then, we had to stay inside, were forced to (I’d like to note here that I was not against the lockdown — if it’s for the greater good and I’m all for it). Thankfully at this point, I was living in a larger space (although my apartment is small by American standards). I didn’t mind at first, like every bookworm, I have a homebody side and I think there was a certain novelty to the whole thing in the beginning.
And, despite it all, I was in my dream city. I picked up my life and moved here 7 years ago and now this is home. But, the more I stayed inside, the more I realized that everything that I loved about Paris had been put on hold — the city was frozen. It led me to reflect on why I came here, what brought me to Paris? I felt like I (re)found my reason when I read this line in Paris France:
“That is why writers have to have two countries, the one where they belong and the one in which they live really. The second one is romantic, it is separate from themselves, it is not real but it is really there.”
That’s right. I needed my second, romantic, separate-from-myself place. When I left home all those years ago it was because I had lost myself on a path that I knew I didn’t want to follow. I decided to do what my heart was telling me to: go to Paris and become a writer. My favorite part about Paris was just how separate it was from myself, my old self, the one who I wanted to leave behind in my hometown. I’m not the first American writer to do this. I won’t be the last.
Stein herself left her hometown in Pennsylvania to move to Paris where she would live for the next 40 years, until her death. Stein had a major impact on the art and literary scene in Paris while she lived there, opening up her salon to the likes of Pablo Picasso, Hemingway, James Joyce, Henri Matisse, and several others you’ll recognize from your art history books. Her opinion was highly valued and she was responsible for catapulting many artists’ careers. She also published dozens of books and critical works herself. I enjoyed Paris France and I also love her poetry. If you’ve ever heard the quote, “Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose,” that’s Stein.
I realize this is more of a reflection of my own experiences in Paris, France during the pandemic, but I also hope that I sparked your interest in Paris France by Gertrude Stein. She’s a modernist writer you’ll want to add to your reading lists — especially if you like stream of consciousness.
The real Paris, my real Paris, is hopefully starting to open back up. Vaccinations are finally starting and slowly but surely cafés and restaurants will be too. In the meantime, the parks are back open, and I can relish in a little no-tourist calmness with another good book, at least for a little while.

A Guide to Solo Traveling in a Big City
I visited Paris for the first time when I was 19 years old while studying abroad next door in Brussels. I thought I was LIVING THE DREAM when I drank straight from a €3 bottle of wine on the grass in front of the Eiffel Tower with my classmates, ate €2 crepes from a street vendor, and visited all of Paris’ history-book landmarks over a long weekend.
I enjoyed rendezvous-ing through the City of Lights, but my 19-year old brain couldn’t help but think that Paris was overrated. It’s just another big city with some history.
That is…until 15 years later. When I returned to Paris as an adult, with 34 years of (s)age and the financial freedom to enjoy a “l’heure de l’apéro” (cocktail hour) in the middle of pleasantly warm June on the terrace of a 5-star hotel, followed by a lavish 5-course culinary affair. On repeat.
The main purpose of the trip was work-related (I operate in the social impact & sustainability space — have you heard of Global Citizen: Live in Paris?) I extended my trip for a few days and intentionally chose a boutique hotel near Emily in Paris’ apartment (Latin Quarters neighborhood), and roamed through the city for a couple of days, this time avoiding the tourist attractions.
While gallivanting through Paris, I discovered the word “flâneur,” signifying:
A person who wanders aimlessly, strolls leisurely through a city, observing and absorbing the surroundings, while embracing a dreamy, contemplative state.
While my 19 year-old self excitingly visited the Louvre, rode a river cruise on the Seine, walked the steps of the Sacré-Cœur Basilica, and drank cheap wine and subpar Parisian street food, my curiously, open-minded, wiser 34-year old self joyfully ‘flâneured’ through the alleyways of Paris, exchanged pleasantries with charming baristas and bartenders, and found herself feeling a refreshing appreciation for the city’s everyday beauty and allure.
I have always wondered why so many fall in love with Paris. I finally understand why ❤️
I went on my very own date with the City of Paris *cue in emoji with the star eyes* and it was m.a.g.i.c.a.l.
Have you ever been to Paris in the summer? Something about it evokes divine energy.
There is so much to indulge in…savor…and take in.
If you have the means, I truly recommend embarking on an adventure to Paris (or any other divine-energy-invoking-city) with no particular plan in mind, by yourself, explore every corner, embrace spontaneity, and adopt a ‘go with the flow’ attitude.
Here’s to how to “date” the next city you’re in, while traveling solo.
If you happen to be in a city where your favorite movie was filmed, visit those places. I went to the idyllic elevated defunct railway (Promenade Plantée) where Ethan Hawke’s “Before Sunset” was filmed. As I mentioned above, and as cheesy as it may sound, I also passed by Emily in Paris’ apartment, and Chef Gabriel’s restaurant (actual name: Terra Nera), and imagined myself how it would be to live their dramatic romantic lives!
2. Befriend the locals. Let them take you places.
I don’t mean actual places. But listen to their story. Get lost in learning about their life. The choices they made that got them to where they are.
While in Paris, I stumbled upon the cutest Indonesian coffee shop and met the owner, Eka who was also the cashier. Feeling hungover after a long boozy night and grateful she fed me a spicy Indonesian soup as a hangover cure, I learned that she has lived in Paris for over 30 years with her child and mother and used to own a travel agency promoting France-Indonesian travel before the pandemic. She closed her travel agency (thanks Covid) and opened a cafe that invites any passersby to taste the earthy aromas of Java coffee and flavorful goodness of Indonesian comfort food. I kept coming back to this cafe for her gregariousness and her motherly embrace.
When you can deeply connect with a stranger, you forget you’re on a trip alone. This was one of my favorite moments of my date with Paris.
3. Rent a bike or moped — if you dare.
An easy, faster way to get around while still being able to appreciate (or wink at) local eye candy is renting a bike or moped. Nowadays, most metropolitan cities allow you to download apps to easily lease alternative forms of transport for a few hours.
One evening in Paris, my cousin, whom I learned had recently moved to the outskirts of the city, came to pick me up in a rented moped. Although I was initially aghast at the idea of getting on a two-wheeled vehicle in an urban convoluted city (and I prayed I wouldn’t have to worry about whether my health insurance would cover my hospital bill abroad), the moped efficiently allowed us to explore the streets of Bastille and Le Marais in search of savory food. We ended up at an Algerian restaurant (my first time trying Algerian food!) and indulged in a feast for the senses. Food coma worthy.
Be bold. Rent the bike. See more.
4. Talk to the bartenders — they will become your best tour guides.
Visit a quintessential cocktail bar and sit by the bar. Chat it up with the bartenders (Where are you from? Oh, you’re not from Paris? You speak English so well. Oh, you’re from Norway. That’s amazing. What brought you here? That’s cool. What are your other favorite bars in the area?) And BAM. You got yourself a curated list of the not-yet-mainstreamed cocktails bars.
The bartender at Little Red Door (where I ordered their out-of-this-world-walnut wine), serendipitously handed me a small card with a crowdsourced list of his and his other bartender friends’ favorite bars. See the card below! I happily visited Bar Bouveau afterwards and enjoyed their Rammos cocktail.
So what are you waiting for? Take.That.Trip. Go on a date with the city itself. Explore its nooks. Go Alone. Cause you’re never truly alone. Connect with strangers. Choose a familiar or unknown place. You have so many options. Let the flâneuring journey enchant you in ways you never imagined.

Picture this — a world-class athlete rises out of the Seine in front of the Eiffel Tower, their toned body glistening in the sun. It is an image of youth and vitality set against the iconic symbol of a triumphant past age. Municipal leaders of Paris have been working hard so that the 2024 Olympics will present exactly this image to the world. It is an image that evokes both past glories and future promise. Specifically, it is an image that promises a better future for Paris, and for the world.
If all goes to plan, swimmers will compete in the Seine during this year’s Olympic games. This will be the latest milestone achieved by an intensive effort to make Paris a greener, more sustainable city. Olympic swimmers competed in the Seine during the games in 1900, but when the Olympics returned to Paris in 1924 swimming in the river had been outlawed. Growth and development degraded water quality in the river throughout the 20th century. By the 1990s, the Seine was one of the most highly polluted rivers in the world.
Paris is now in the midst of a green revolution. This is part of a larger plan for a broad-based ecological and social transition by the city. An ambitious program to plant trees and nurture gardens on vacant plots has made the city’s streets greener. There are more bicycles, fewer cars, and an expanded Metro system. A walking path, parks, and cafes line the Right Bank of the Seine where there was once an expressway. Paris aims to be, not just a greener city, but the world’s preeminent sustainable city — the model for other cities to follow.
Paris has done this before. In 1900, Paris declared itself to be the “Capital of the Civilized World” at the opening of the International Exposition Universelle. It was the height of the industrial revolution, the Age of Progress, a time of unbridled optimism, and Paris embodied the hope and promise of the new century.
Revolutionary change, experimentation, and innovation are ingrained in the city’s DNA. Paris — Capital of the Civilized World — was the product of a century of profound political, economic, and social upheaval, the 19th century. That century began, appropriately enough, with the French Revolution of 1789.
Paris has long held the ambition to be the preeminent city of the world, comparable to the fabled cities of Athens and Rome during ancient times. Wary of the city’s ambition and its growing power in the 17th century, King Louis XIV moved his royal court out of Paris to the village of Versailles. Leaders of the French Revolution returned the seat of government to Paris in 1789. Then, as the aristocracy of Europe and England looked on in horror, they brought the French monarchy to an end with a swift slice from the guillotine.
During the following century, Paris grew from a population of 550,000 in 1800 to 2.7 million in 1900. At the same time, the continuing impact of the French Revolution and the industrial revolution upended the social order in France. The French monarchy was removed, restored, then finally brought to a permanent end. The aristocracy and clergy lost their privileged positions. The feudal economy, based on hereditary control of rural estates worked by peasant farmers, gave way to an increasingly urbanized economic system based on industry and commerce.
The turbulent 19th century raised the social classes of the bourgeoisie and the working class to prominence. Members of the Bourgeoisie class, particularly industrialists and financiers, exploited the opportunities brought by industrialization to amass personal fortunes that rivaled the wealth of the established aristocratic families. The working class in Paris grew as rural peasants were thrown into the city by desperate circumstances. Paris became an arena where these two classes struggled for survival and control over their fates, sparking revolutions in 1830, and 1848, and the uprising of the Paris Commune in 1870.
At the hands of Emperors Napoleon Bonaparte and his nephew Louis Napoleon, Paris was transformed from a medieval city into a modern metropolis, and it acquired the trappings of monumental architecture appropriate to its ambition. During the First French Empire (1804 to 1814), Napoleon Bonaparte made Paris the seat of a European empire of conquest. During the Second French Empire (1852 to 1870), Louis-Napoleon launched the decades-long urban renewal project that gave the streets of Paris the distinctive character they retain today.
The vast social experiment of 19th century France also produced a distinctive third new class of individuals, far less numerous than either the Bourgeoisie or the working class but more influential in their own way — the professional engineer. Highly educated in math and science, French engineers worked in government and industry as technocrats and entrepreneurs. At the end of the 19th century engineers in France held positions of influence and power. By their training engineers were imbued with a shared purpose to serve the common good through public works.
At the hands of the engineers, the Industrial Revolution made Paris a center of industry and finance and a showcase of modern technology. Known as the City of Light, Paris was among the first cities to be illuminated by gaslights, early in the century, and electricity at the century’s end. Paris became the center of a global network for communication and transportation made possible with the invention of the railroad, steamships, the telegraph, and the telephone.
The construction of the Eiffel Tower in 1889 proclaimed the technological and industrial prowess of Paris and France. The tower served as the centerpiece for the Expositions Universelle in 1889, 1900 and 1937. The Eiffel Tower was, by far, the tallest structure ever built, a title it held for 40 years. It was a spear thrust triumphantly into the sky by French engineers.
The greening of Paris began in earnest with 2015, the year in which Paris hosted the COP21 negotiations that produced the first international agreement to combat climate change. At the beginning of the 21st century, over half of all people live in cities. Therefore, cities will play a central role in efforts to combat climate change and preserve the environment. And, Paris intends to lead
The goals for greening Paris address climate change and its impacts, environmental quality, biodiversity, energy, urban agriculture, reducing waste, and building a circular economy. Municipal leaders want to make Paris 100 percent cyclable by 2026 and eliminate diesel- and gasoline-powered cars entirely by 2030. Twenty percent of buildings will have green roofs by 2030. New parks are being created and trees are being planted everywhere.
The infrastructure of the city, its roads, canals, rail lines, parks, buildings, and subterranean spaces, is the foundation on which municipal leaders intend to build a sustainable city. The Eiffel Tower, built to celebrate the achievements of a past age, is being repurposed as the flagship for the greening of Paris. The tower sits at the center of the area between the Place de Trocadero and the Ecole Militaire, a swath 1.6 kilometers long, that is being transformed into a new “green lung” for Paris.
Making the Seine swimmable again will be an engineering triumph. In 2020 engineers launched a crash program to connect more homes to sewer networks, upgrade sewage treatment upstream of Paris, and carve a vast subterranean cavern in the southeastern corner of the city. The Austerlitz storage basin, buried below the Square Marie-Curie, is 50 meters in diameter and 30 meters deep. During heavy rains it can capture a volume of water equivalent to twenty Olympic swimming pools to prevent sewers from overflowing and polluting the Seine.
The return of swimming to the Seine after 100 years is a dream that appeals even to skeptics of the city’s greening efforts. Some older residents grumble that removing cars from some streets has made it nearly impossible to drive anywhere in the city. However, many others embrace the fact that it is now easier to get around by bicycle. Life in Paris has improved in many other respects. The image of Olympic swimmers competing in the Seine bolsters Paris’ claim to the greenest city title, and it will demonstrate to the world what is possible for cities to accomplish.

Chapter 1: Arriving in Paris
It is not every day I have the chance to spend a couple of days in Paris. Actually, it was the first time.
As an online student of French for the last year, I was eager to finally practice it in real life, … with real French people in Paris. How would my voice sound outside a safe virtual classroom in a natural conversation?
Unfortunately, a viral throat infection two weeks before the trip resulted in irritative coughing I was still recovering from. So, I landed in the City of Lights trying to keep my sanitary composure and avoiding as much as I could, to cough. Apart from speaking, laughing, and inhaling dry air, I was doing good.
Breathing as serenely as a Buddhist monk. Trying not to raise everybody´s eyebrows and concerns around COVID — my covid 19 test was negative, to be in the records — it was finally my turn in the line at the passport control cabin.
After the first well-pronounced Bonjour monsieur (*), a cough burst from nowhere came. Red face, I smiled. Passport stamped.
After some other funny episodes. I´ve decided to speak absolutely when necessary. Mostly for being respectful with good use of French etiquette…

Autumn colors gracefully adorned the myriad trees as we walked across the path toward the Eiffel Tower.
The crisp, cool air was deep and rich, and the thick scent of the season hung like jewels suspended in air. We approached one of the world’s most recognizable icons.
Reagan, my oldest daughter, was nine years old. Like so many other girls her age, she was inclined to romantic notions of perfection when it came to Paris. Dreamily, she twirled and danced her way down the path, enticing her sisters into a swirling orbit of joy around her.
“Isn’t the Eiffel Tower just EVERYTHING you imagined it would be?” she said excitedly. “It’s so big. And look at the red and orange trees! Oh Mommy, it’s all just perfect — like a postcard!”
Smiling with shared glee, I pushed back my sunhat and peeked up at the iron tower which has symbolized the glamor and mystery of Paris for more than 130 years. Despite its height, it was stil looked friendly and inviting as it soared majestically up into the blue October sky.
I wondered if Gustave Eiffel, its French engineer, had any idea what fame his brainchild was to gain when he began its construction in 1887 in preparation for the Exposition Universelle.
We’d just come from the Avenue des Champs-Élysées, where we’d spent the morning walking the fashionable streets with baguettes in hand, sipping coffee and just enjoying the Frenchness of it all.
The streets were adorned with beautiful women who laced their way in and out of the shops in their heeled boots while toting high-end handbags. Their mouths were arranged expertly into the perfect French pout, eyebrows arched to perfection. Both the pout and the eyebrows were feats I felt were achievable by Parisian women alone.
At the enthusiastic request of our youngest, three year old little Peyton, we lingered at a fanciful shop on our walk. We stayed just long enough for each of us to choose a colorful French macaron to try. The kids were spoiled for choice as they eyed the stacks of pastel delights, which teased their taste buds into agreeing to share with each other so they could try more than one.
When we had reached the close of the promenade, we came upon the Arc de Triomphe. Marveling at its intricate architecture from across the street, I told the girls the story of the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte and his wife Marie-Louise. The couple first passed through the Arc in 1810, which was while it was still under construction.
“Sadly, Napoleon did not live to see his vision of the Arc completed,” I shared with the family, “The Arc was only consecrated when Napoleon died and the hearse carrying his remains passed under it.
Little did Napoleon know that it would one day become a campsite for Prussian troops after the fall of the empire. And this Arc has more stories, too! Come, let’s see.”
As we crossed under the busy round-about and emerged on the other side, we were under the Arc. The girls’ eyes were wide with thought as they imagined the many stories as we stood under the four allegorical high-reliefs, which were finished after the French Revolution in 1835.
Later that night, as I tucked four pairs of arms and legs into cozy Parisian beds, I asked the girls about their favorite moments of their first day in Paris. With a happy sigh, Reagan quickly said it was hugging the Eiffel Tower for the first time and looking out over the city from the second floor, after climbing 674 steps to reach the landing.
Madison, our second daughter, said she’d loved having a picnic on the glass floor inside the Eiffel Tower and video calling various friends around the world so they could “be there” with her in person to experience it.
Devyn, who wants to be a chef when she grows up, mentioned several of the French foods she tried throughout our day — crêpes, quiche, and chocolate soufflé. Finally, I turned to little Peyton, but she was already asleep, a Parisian style beret still perched haphazardly on her small head.
Paris was bursting with history, art, impressionable people, and delectable foods to try. We were ready to take our time, immersing ourselves in it all.
