Hungary, a central European country in the Carpathian Basin, is theorized to be named after the Huns that invaded the territory in the fifth century. Since then, it has experienced a whirlwind of change and history. From 1867 to 1918 it was part of one of the largest and most influential empires in Europe — the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It later existed as a monarchy with no king, an Axis Power in World War II, a Soviet communist regime throughout the Cold War, and eventually a democracy under the European Union.
Budapest, the capital, is arguably one of the most beautiful cities in Europe. Known as the “Paris of the East’, it is filled with incredible architecture, amazing food, and a unique culture. It was once considered two separate cities until their unification in 1873. “Buda”, situated on the west bank of the Danube, is hilly, residential, and home to the Buda Castle. “Pest”, on the other side of the river, is flat, commercial, and the site of the Parliament Building. They are connected by a series of bridges, including the iconic Széchenyi Chain Bridge, the city’s first permanent structure to span the Danube.
The city has numerous things to do and see over the course of three days. Keep in mind that this guide is for groups that love to walk everywhere and remain always on the go. Feel free to alter based on your interests and abilities.
The nation’s official language is Hungarian or “Magyar”, referring to the ancestors of modern Hungarians. It is one of the world’s five hardest languages to learn and dissimilar to any other European language. Thankfully most locals in the touristic areas of the city speak English so it’s easy to get around.
WiFi is available and strong at most hotels and establishments.
Budapest is extremely hot in the summer (averaging 80°F but higher during frequent heat waves) and chilly in the winter (around 40°F with infrequent snow). The best time to visit is when temperatures are relatively mild from September through November and April through May.
Budapest, like most European cities, is very safe. The primary thing to watch out for are pickpockets — especially in crowded, touristy areas.
The best way to get from the airport — the Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport (BUD) — to downtown is by using Uber. It’s affordable, easy, and takes roughly thirty minutes. Welcome Pickups also offers reliable transfers. As for taxis, wait in the designated taxi line outside arrivals to avoid scams. This allows you to inform the attendant of your destination and receive a price quote before even entering a vehicle. Avoid cabs downtown as they tend to rip off foreigners.
Once in the city, I typically like to walk most places. However, some areas are spread out or require climbing scores of steps (specifically in sloping Buda) so if that’s intimidating, purchase a metro pass for the day to use an unlimited number of times. It’s also worth noting that many metro stations do not have a ticket booth so one must walk to another nearby station or digitally buy on the BudapestGo app. Do NOT get onboard without having paid. Trust me as I learned the hard way. The city hires metro employees to check for tickets on all public transports and getting caught without one results in a massive fine. The charge I received close to a decade ago was €50 so I can only imagine what it is now! Be sure to also validate the ticket, whether a day pass or an individual purchase, upon entering the transport. If the employees catch you without the validation, even if the ticket is in your hand, you risk getting fined.
Restaurant recommendations are listed below -
Tap water is completely safe to drink. Fountains are located all over the city to allow for easy bottle refills.
The country’s main currency is the Hungarian Forint (HUF, ft). Although it’s part of the European Union, Hungary cannot use the Euro because it has not met all financial and economic EU requirements to be able to adopt the coin. Credit cards are accepted in most establishments, including smaller market stalls. Regardless, carry some cash to play it safe.
As for prices — I hate to say it but the secret of Budapest is OUT! I first visited in 2017 and everything was cheap — far cheaper than other Eastern European cities. Thanks to Instagram and word of mouth, tourism has skyrocketed and with it, the prices. It’s by no means near the level of cities like Paris, London, and Stockholm; but it’s much more expensive than it used to be. Stick to the rule of thumb that the closer one is to the Danube River, the higher the prices will be.
Note: Most of this outline highlights costs in USD. This is a conversion to make it easier for some readers. Costs vary and everything is charged in the local currency when in person.
Tipping is not mandatory but with the influx of western tourism, many service industry employees now expect at least a little something. Round up to the nearest dollar to tip 10% with exceptional service.
The best location to stay is in the 5th district on the Pest side as it’s culturally charming and the closest to main attractions. Others may opt to stay in the 1st district, also known as the Castle District, on the Buda side due to its beauty and upscale nature.
Hungary uses the same outlet type as those in continental Europe; the type F plug.
It’s time to explore this amazing city. Start with breakfast at Honey in the center of Pest then prepare to walk off the hearty feast. I always recommend doing a free walking tour upon arriving in a new city. Budapest is so large and full of history that it offers numerous tour options including separate tours of both Buda and Pest as well as a Jewish Quarter Tour and a Communism Tour. Now, I understand that four walking tours is a lot — so pick one or two and go from there. If looking to learn the basics of the city, start with the Pest Tour and complete the Buda Tour the following day.
The Pest Tour highlights the liveliness of its side of the Danube. It passes by the beautiful Parliament Building, St. Stephen’s Basilica, and the pedestrian-only area of Vörösmarty Square. Learn fun facts about famous Hungarians. For example — did you know the inventors of the rubix cube, ballpoint pen, and holograms were all from Hungary? The excursion also showcases the city’s harrowing side, including the newly built Shoe Memorial which is a tribute to the Jewish residents ruthlessly executed by militiamen in WWII.
After, grab lunch then walk twenty minutes to the House of Terror Museum to dive more into the nation’s dark history. Housed in the former Nazi headquarters (lovingly once referred to as the “House of Loyalty”), the museum exhibits the reign of terror inflicted on the civilian population during both the Second World War and communism era. It is estimated that the Hungarian party captured and mistreated one person from every third family during this terror regime, oftentimes housing them in this building against their will. It’s a stop that can’t be missed and deserves at least ninety minutes.
Visitors have the option to purchase an audio guide as most of the exhibits are in Hungarian. However, the audio is about the same price as the ticket itself so it’s a bit expensive to get both. Instead, use the complimentary English print outs located in each exhibit that depict the same information.
Note: The museum is closed on Mondays. In addition, all bags must be left in the guarded storage area during the duration of the visit.
To return to the main area of Pest, walk along the gorgeous tree lined Andrassy Boulevard. Enjoy an early dinner at the delicious Hungarian restaurant located in the Jewish Quarter, Gettó Gulyás (reservations highly recommended), before grabbing drinks at the famous Szimpla Kert next door. This is one of many bohemian ruin pubs scattered across the city, named for the fact that they are set in abandoned warehouses and factories. Szimpla Kert in particular has numerous rooms and floors with various mismatched pieces of furniture, frequent live music, and a bustling vibe that comes to life in the evenings. It’s a must-do while in the Paris of the East.
Begin the day with a stroll through the Great Market Hall, the largest and oldest market in the city — and one that is best visited in the morning when it’s liveliest. Browse through three floors of fresh produce, meats, and trinkets. The top floor offers delicious but absurdly expensive food for takeaway. I purchased freshly made lángos — fried dough topped with meats and cheeses — that I didn’t realize was around $20 USD until it was too late! Consider grabbing breakfast elsewhere to avoid these high prices. Regardless, the market itself is a must-see, even if avoiding making a purchase.
Next, hop on the metro for thirty minutes or grab a fifteen minute Uber to the beautiful Margitsziget Island. The 250 acre island is located directly between Buda and Pest and named after Saint Margaret, a nun who lived in a medieval convent on the land. It is filled with walking paths, gardens, and small cafes, among many things. Walk or rent bikes and pedal cars to explore the 1.5 mile long area at a faster pace.
It’s time to explore Buda. Remember that this side of the city is extremely hilly so stairs and steep roads are ubiquitous. Walking from Margitsziget takes about fifty minutes and involves at least 100 steps; so if this isn’t your forte, take public transportation or Uber. Another option is to trek along the water on the Buda side then use the funicular near the Chain Bridge to avoid the climb. Regardless of how you arrive, you’ll likely be starving after the trek. We didn’t find many restaurants on our walk over, so we caved and ate at the pricey yet tasty and historic Halászbástya Étterem on the Fisherman’s Bastion. This iconic landmark, named after the fisherman’s guild in the Middle Ages tasked with guarding this area, provides exceptional panoramic views. Dining on its terraces is worth the splurge. We were lucky and got a spot without a reservation; but I’d recommend booking ahead of time if this is important to you.
Later join a special paid walking tour of the Buda Castle District and the Hospital in the Rock, an underground cave system used as a hospital and nuclear bunker during World War II and the Cold War. It is now a museum. The district portion includes a stop by the Matthias Church where Hungarian Kings were crowned, the Sándor Palace where the president of Hungary resides, and the Ruszwurm, the oldest confectionery in the country. Learn that this area is older than Pest as the royalty and rich settled early on in the hills of Buda for protection and defense against invaders. The next portion, the tour of the museum, runs about one hour. Utilizing realistic wax figures, it recreates lifelike scenes to showcase the purposes of the bomb shelter and medical complex. Bring a jacket as it gets cold underground.
Note: I highly recommend the museum. This combined tour occurs every day at 2pm except on Sundays and Mondays when it does not operate. However, if the Hospital in the Rock doesn’t interest you, take a free walking tour of the district instead.
After the tour, grab a drink (reservations required) at the White Raven Skybar & Lounge, the rooftop bar with amazing views at the Hilton Budapest in the Buda Castle District. Take the funicular down or walk across the Chain Bridge to return to Pest to hop aboard an evening cruise down the Danube for an exceptional panorama of the city lit up at night. If still up for another cocktail after disembarking, stop by one of the numerous “boat bars” along the water. Spoon is my favorite.
Spend the final day choosing between several different options. Interested in doing something different? Take a day trip to Bratislava, Slovakia; which is small enough that it really only merits one quick day. Want to stay in Budapest? Join the Jewish or Communism walking tours to learn more about the harrowing eras of the country. Yearning to have a spa day? Visit the famous Széchenyi Thermal Bath to see why Budapest is known as the “City of Spas”. Choose your own adventure.
Note: Truthfully, I wasn’t impressed by the baths upon entering and turned around before purchasing a ticket as the pools were overwhelmingly crowded. Perhaps I would have actually visited if it were earlier in the day and therefore less populated.
Finally, enjoy a cocktail in the separate bar area of Twentysix Budapest then have dinner at the Hungarian classic, VakVarjú. Reservations are highly recommended for both establishments.
Spending more time in Eastern Europe? Check out my guides on Bucharest, Romania, Belgrade, Serbia and Slovenia.

Why Everyone Falls in Love With Budapest (Even If They Don’t Expect To)
Look, I didn’t expect to fall head over heels for Budapest. I really didn’t. It wasn’t even at the top of my travel list. But there I was — one lazy evening by the Danube, sipping cheap Hungarian wine, watching the city lights sparkle like someone accidentally scattered diamonds across the river — and I got it. I finally got why people who visit Budapest never shut up about it.
Budapest sneaks up on you like that. It’s not flashy like Paris or crowded like Rome. It’s got this raw, quiet charm — equal parts old-world nostalgia and youthful, rebellious energy. A little rough around the edges, but that’s part of the magic.
So if you’re even thinking about a trip to Europe, let me tell you why Budapest deserves to be on your list. And yeah, I’ll throw in some practical info about transport, prices, and how not to get ripped off (because we’ve all been there).
It’s hard to explain this without sounding like a walking travel brochure, but Budapest is absurdly beautiful. The kind of beautiful that makes you stop mid-walk to take it all in.
The city is split in two by the Danube River. On one side, you’ve got Buda — the hilly, quiet, castle-filled side that looks straight out of a fairy tale. On the other, Pest — flat, lively, buzzing with cafes, ruin bars, and late-night energy.
Crossing the iconic Chain Bridge, especially at night, is basically a rite of passage. The Parliament building glows like a golden crown, the castle up on the hill looks down like a protective big brother, and everything feels cinematic. It’s the kind of place where even your terrible iPhone photos look frame-worthy.
If you’re like me, you judge a city by how fun it is to get lost in. Budapest? 10/10 on the lost-and-loving-it scale.
Just walk. Seriously. Around every corner, you’ll stumble onto something — a hidden courtyard, a tiny cafe pouring strong coffee, street art popping off crumbling walls.
The Jewish Quarter is full of life, history, and those famous ruin bars (more on that later). Andrássy Avenue feels like the Champs-Élysées’ cooler, less expensive cousin. And then there’s Fisherman’s Bastion, which looks like it was plucked straight from a Disney movie.
Bonus? It’s all surprisingly affordable, so you won’t feel guilty grabbing an extra coffee or beer while you explore.
Hungarian food might not win any points for being health-conscious, but if you love rich, hearty, comforting meals? You’re in for a treat.
Goulash soup — rich broth, tender beef, paprika for days. It warms you up from the inside, especially if you’re here in winter.
Lángos — deep-fried dough topped with sour cream and cheese. Yes, your arteries might protest, but your tastebuds will send thank-you notes.
And of course, the sweet stuff. You can’t leave without trying Kürtőskalács, or chimney cake — crispy on the outside, soft and sugary inside, often filled with Nutella or ice cream because, well, Europe.
Pro tip? Skip the tourist trap restaurants near major attractions. Duck into side streets or head to the markets (like Great Market Hall) for authentic, affordable eats.
You haven’t really done Budapest until you’ve been to a ruin bar. These are old, abandoned buildings — once apartments or factories — transformed into quirky, graffiti-covered, fairy-light-strewn pubs.
The most famous? Szimpla Kert. Yeah, it’s touristy. But also? Totally worth it.
Think mismatched furniture, old bicycles hanging from ceilings, vintage TVs turned into fish tanks. It’s weird. It’s wonderful. It’s Budapest at its best — unpolished, unexpected, unforgettable.
After all that walking, eating, and drinking, you’ll need to soak those tired legs. Enter: Budapest’s famous thermal baths.
The Széchenyi Baths are the most iconic — huge outdoor pools surrounded by yellow Neo-Baroque buildings. Sitting in naturally warm, mineral-rich waters while the steam rises and snow falls? Unreal. It feels like a scene from some aristocratic European fantasy.
If you want something quieter, check out Gellért Baths — same thermal goodness, but a bit less crowded and arguably even more beautiful inside.
Budapest is surprisingly accessible. Flights from major European cities are often dirt cheap thanks to budget airlines like Ryanair or Wizz Air. I paid about €60 round trip from Berlin, but prices vary.
From the airport (Liszt Ferenc International), it’s super easy to get into the city:
Once you’re in the city? The metro, trams, and buses are reliable and affordable. Single tickets are around €1.30, but day passes save money if you’re hopping around a lot.
Budapest is one of the best-value cities in Europe for what you get. Here’s a rough idea:
Food, drinks, attractions — it all feels refreshingly affordable compared to Western Europe.
Here’s the thing: Budapest isn’t loud about how beautiful it is. It doesn’t shove its history or architecture or nightlife in your face. But it lingers.
It’s the way the old trams rattle by as the sun sets. It’s the quiet courtyards filled with ivy and cracked tiles. It’s the unexpected friendliness of locals when you ask for directions. It’s the weird mix of melancholy and hope that seems stitched into the city’s DNA.
You leave Budapest feeling like you’ve discovered a secret. Like you stumbled onto something special most people overlook. And trust me, once you’ve felt that, you’ll want to come back.
Absolutely. Whether you’re a budget backpacker, a romantic couple, a solo explorer, or someone who just wants to eat, soak, and wander — you’ll find your version of Budapest.
And who knows? Maybe you’ll sit by the Danube at sunset, just like I did, and realize you’ve fallen for this quiet, unexpected, unforgettable city too.

Budapest is just a one-hour flight from Frankfurt, yet somehow it had always managed to stay on my “someday” travel list – until recently. After hearing so many glowing reviews from my friends who went there, I decided it was finally time to visit the Hungarian capital. And I wanted it to be special.
I knew Budapest had a rich and complicated past. It’s a city that’s lived through the fall of Habsburg Empire, two world wars, decades of Soviet control, and then independence, only to later become one of the more controversial members of the European Union. Its president, Viktor Orbán, is seen by some as the EU’s troublemaker, and by others as a national hero standing up for Hungary’s interests against Brussels bureaucracy.
My husband Jacob’s birthday was on October 10th, so I surprised him with a three-day trip to Budapest. It turned out to be the perfect gift – for both of us.
After landing at BUD airport, I quickly withdrew some local forints from an ATM, bought a 3-day public transportation pass, and we hopped on a bus to the city center.
Ironically, the only time we needed cash was to use the city’s public toilets. Everything else – restaurants, cafés, museums, even parking garages – happily accepted card payments.
We stayed in Pest, the flat and lively part of the city, located on the eastern side of the Danube. Our apartment was in a grand building from the early 20th century, built when Hungary was part of the powerful Austro-Hungarian Empire. The building had a certain faded opulence, and when we entered through its massive doors, we stepped into a spacious inner courtyard that felt like a quiet oasis in contrast to the bustling streets just outside.
The stillness of the courtyard, the gentle echo of footsteps on stone, the soft light filtering through iron balconies – something about it got to me. I know it sounds a little silly, but I went back to the apartment and changed my dress to fit the mood. For a moment, I imagined myself as a high-society lady from another century. A bit of harmless fantasy – but one that made me feel strangely at home.
From our place, we were just a 10-minute walk to the majestic Hungarian Parliament building. The views from Pest across to the hills of Buda and Óbuda were breathtaking, especially as the golden-hour light swept across the rooftops and bridges.
Despite my concern that Budapest might be dimly lit at night due to the ongoing energy crisis in Europe since 2022, I was delighted to see that the city had not sacrificed its evening magic. The Chain Bridge, Parliament, and surrounding churches and streets were all warmly illuminated. It gave the city a cozy, welcoming glow, especially as we walked along the Danube that first chilly October evening.
Crossing the Chain Bridge to Buda felt like traveling back in time. While the apartment had sparked my 1920s fantasy, the streets of Buda pulled me firmly back into 2023, with their calm atmosphere, historical depth, and incredible views over the river. It was such a contrast to Pest’s high energy. Pest is where you go for fun and food, and people-watching; Buda is where you slow down and breathe.
That first night in Budapest, I remember standing on the bridge with Jacob, the cold wind tugging at my coat, the lights dancing on the water, and thinking: Why did I wait so long to come here?
Budapest made a strong first impression – so strong that I already knew one visit wouldn’t be enough.

There’s something truly magical about Budapest, a city where history and modernity dance together under the soft glow of the Danube. My journey through this enchanting capital was a mix of awe-inspiring sights, heartwarming moments, and a few unexpected adventures.
I kicked off my trip with a visit to the House of Terror, a museum that leaves you both haunted and humbled. It’s a stark reminder of Hungary’s turbulent past, with exhibits that make you pause and reflect on the resilience of the human spirit.
But it wasn’t all somber. The next stop was the Budapest Castle and Fisherman’s Bastion, a place so beautiful I had to see it twice — once by day and again under the cover of night. Imagine standing there, the lights of the city twinkling below, with the majestic Parliament building standing proudly in the distance. It was as if the entire city was laid out like a masterpiece, just for me. The serenity of the Bastion made it my favorite spot, offering a panoramic view that felt like a scene straight out of a fairy tale.
Speaking of cinematic moments, strolling across the Chain Bridge at night brought back memories of a Bollywood movie called Raabta. As I hummed the tune from the film, I couldn’t help but feel like the leading character in my own story, the city playing the perfect backdrop.
Of course, no trip is complete without a little adventure — or misadventure, in my case. While exploring the city, we were caught on a tram without a valid ticket. Picture this: we were confidently cruising along with our group ticket, only to discover it had somehow vanished. Despite our best efforts to explain, the tram inspectors weren’t having any of it, and we ended up paying a hefty fine. As international students, this was a blow to our budget, but we didn’t let it spoil our day. Instead, we laughed it off and headed straight to the House of Parliament to soak in more of the city’s rich history.
Another highlight was the Gellért Hill, where I found myself surrounded by breathtaking views and a sense of calm that’s hard to describe. The city seemed to whisper its secrets as I wandered through, feeling more at peace with each step.
The Museum of Ethnography and House of Music was a treat for the senses, offering a deeper understanding of Hungary’s cultural roots. Each exhibit was a doorway into the soul of the nation, and I found myself completely immersed in the stories they told.
The Central Market Hall was an absolute feast — not just for the eyes, but for the taste buds too. Cheaper than Italy and bursting with flavors, it was a paradise for food lovers. Even as a vegetarian, I found plenty to indulge in, proving that good food knows no borders.
The Ferris Wheel of Budapest gave off serious London vibes, and while we decided to skip the ride due to the price, the view from below was worth every moment. We wrapped up our day with a visit to Heroes’ Square and Vajdahunyad Castle, each place steeped in history and brimming with stories waiting to be discovered.
And let’s not forget the poignant Shoes on the Danube Bank memorial, a tribute to the lives lost during one of history’s darkest times. It’s a simple yet powerful reminder of the city’s resilience and the importance of remembering our past.
On our last night, we decided to dive into Budapest’s legendary nightlife. I’m talking about the Ruin Bars — and if you haven’t heard of them, you’re in for a treat. These bars are unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. Picture this: abandoned buildings transformed into eclectic spaces filled with mismatched furniture, vibrant art, and a vibe that’s both laid-back and buzzing with energy. The one we visited, Szimpla Kert, felt like stepping into a different world, where every corner had something new to discover. Whether it was the quirky décor, the lively crowd, or the amazing music, the ruin bars truly captured the spirit of Budapest — blending the old with the new in the most unexpected ways.
Despite a few hiccups, my Budapest adventure was a whirlwind of beauty, history, and unforgettable experiences. The city’s mix of old-world charm and vibrant energy left me feeling both invigorated and at peace. Whether it was the stunning architecture, the delicious food, or the warm company of new friends, Budapest cast a spell on me that I’ll carry with me for a long time.

Near the end of June, I met my fiancée in Budapest for a two-week summer vacation. When I first told my father about my summer travel plans, he lovingly mocked me, lamenting that there was nothing interesting about the capital of Hungary that made it a worthwhile site to visit.
He’s not alone in his thoughts as most people don’t think of visiting Budapest compared to other European cities. A simple Google search turns up Rome, Paris and Barcelona as some of the top European cities to visit, but Budapest never makes the list.
When tourists do travel to Budapest, often the Hungarian capital serves as a starting point or end point for river cruises — but never a destination on its own.
However, after having spent two weeks of the summer travelling throughout Budapest, I can attest that it is vastly underrated as a potential travel hotspot on its own.
From an array of culinary classics to stunning views, there is so much to do, see and experience in Hungary’s capital. But this isn’t intended to be a travel guide. Well, sort of — there might be some pearls of travelling wisdom and Hungarian hotspots sprinkled…

In my first two posts about Budapest, I wrote about how young and vibrant the city is and what a great choice it is for a food lover, especially if you are a vegetarian like me.
All of it was reserved for the Pest part of the city and now the time has come for me to share my Buda travel experience.
The Hungarian capital used to be three separate cities, which joined together to form Budapest in 1873. The three former cities were originally known as Buda, Pest, and Óbuda.
The distance between Buda and Pest is only 844 meters, separated by the Danube, which is the second-longest river in Europe after the Volga in Russia.
But the two parts of the city are completely different in all the respects I can imagine.
Pest, located on the east bank of the river, is where all of the action happens — the place to be touristy, hang out and have fun.
Buda, situated on the west side of the Danube, is very conservative and quiet. It is the place to go for a leisurely sightseeing experience. It is also a perfect place to go on a first date to get to know each other or have your fashion pictures taken on a nice sunny day. The background is stunning.
East versus West. Is it not what the modern history of Europe is all about? We have seen how the EU, which was established with the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and was consisting at first only of the 12 West European countries, expanded gradually to the East. Hungary…

Posted: 10/29/2023 | October 29th, 2023
Budapest is one of the most fun — and most underrated — cities in Europe. While it’s become more popular in recent years, it still sees only a fraction of tourists compared to London or Paris (about 80% fewer, to be exact).
Popular with backpackers who come to enjoy the lively nightlife, it is also bursting with incredible historic sights, lots of cheap eats, and a plethora of relaxing thermal baths. There’s a ton to see and do, and it’s super affordable compared to Western Europe.
Since it actually comprises three cities (Buda, Pest, and Obuda), picking the right area to stay in is important. While Budapest isn’t massive, you’ll waste a lot of time in transit if you don’t pick the right area for your plans.
To help you save time and money, here’s my list of the best neighborhoods, so you know exactly where to stay in Budapest. These are the areas I stay in myself, because they are close to all the action, so you never have to travel far to get around.
Located on the Buda side of town, this popular district is home to Buda Castle, Fisherman’s Bastion, and the towering Gellért Hill, which offers stunning views over the city. The famous Rudas and Gellért Baths (popular thermal spas) are also here. It’s a gorgeous area to stay in and leans upscale, with plenty of luxe accommodations and many fancy eateries. The photogenic Széchenyi Chain Bridge, which connects to District V, is nearby too.
Best places to stay in the Castle District:
This is the heart of the city, so if it’s your first time or you only have a few nights, stay here. You’ll be within walking distance of many of the top sights, including the massive Parliament building as well as St. Stephen’s Basilica. The photogenic chain bridge is nearby too, as is the massive Central Market. Just keep in mind that this district isn’t the cheapest. But if you want to splurge (a little or a lot), then it won’t disappoint!
Best places to stay in Parliament & Belváros:
This budget-friendly area, located on the Pest side of town, is home to the most popular thermal bath, Széchenyi. There are many other tourist sites too, such as the Terror Museum and the Opera House. Andrássy Avenue, a UNESCO site meant to imitate the famous Champs-Élysées in Paris, is also here.
While there is plenty to see and do, the neighborhood is not crammed with hotels like other areas. That means you get a good mix of convenience (you can still walk downtown) while also experiencing a bit more of the local pace of life.
Best places to stay in Terézváros:
The Dohány Street Synagogue is a must-see stop for anyone who visits Budapest. However, the main draw in this district is the nightlife. Specifically, the ruin bars.
Once underground party venues hidden away in abandoned buildings, they are now a massive part of the city’s thriving nightlife. The bars are unique and eclectic, unlike any other bar you’ve been to — a must for first-time visitors. The most popular (and coolest) bar, Szimpla Kert, and the massive Instant-Fogas Complex (a ruin bar and club) are both in this district.
The popular Karaván outdoor food market (right near Szimpla) is also here, offering a wide variety of amazing eats. And if you’re vegan, some of the best veg restaurants in town are nearby.

Some even go as far as to say it’s their favourite European city. Budapest has a special charm that I can’t quite put my finger on. It has beautiful architecture, but so does every other European city I’ve visited. Is it because it’s a melting pot of cultures? Tourists from every country flock here for any number of reasons.
Buda (the hilly part on one side of the Danube) and Pest (the flat side where most of the city lies) together make the famous, much talked about, city of Budapest. And if you’re in the know, the pronunciation is more like Budapesht.
Is it because I’m crook* that I’m not appreciating all of its charms? Or have I simply been spoiled by Poland? Or a little of each? I decided I’d get out of my sickbed and do a little reccie of my neighbourhood. Perhaps, even pop into the church to check out any stained glass? St Stephen’s Basilica is maybe 100 metres away. When I was here in 2011 with my sister, niece and daughters, we walked into the church for…

Why Budapest is second to none in Eastern Europe
Recently, I returned to the one and only magical Hungarian capital of Budapest, exactly a year after my first visit when I was road tripping the Balkans!
Budapest is renowned to be one of the most impressive and picturesque cities in Europe, and it’s also famous for its never sleeping nightlife scene and tasty Hungarian food on offer.
It is thus a popular hotspot for many different kinds of tourists: casual city getaway tourists, architecture and history geeks, nature lovers, party goers and nightlife enthusiasts as well as foodies.
Obviously many cities in Europe also offer all the above and thus attract the same type and number of visitors each year.
But on a personal note, especially when it comes to Eastern Europe, Budapest is quite definitely second to none, and let me explain to you why!
First of all, Budapest is just as pretty, impressive and utterly gorgeous and astonishing as a city as its famous neighbour Vienna, Austria’s capital which is renowned to be Europe’s most liveable city.

The beautiful city, glorious past and rich present
Budapest is the capital of Hungary and one of the most beautiful cities in Europe. It lies on the Danube River that divides it into two sections: Buda and Pest. Both sides are wonderful. The city has a very interesting history, very vibrant culture, an up-and-coming economy, and a favorite destination of travelers around the world.
Short History of Budapest
Ancient in a very sense, as long as the history can have been, Budapest comes since Romans first inhabited the place where they built towns around “Aquincum”, while after that land got populated by various different tribes such as Huns and Slavs and other related groups of people-Avars. In the ninth century, the Hungarian tribes set foot in the place as well, giving an emerging strong Hungarian kingdom rise at the same time, growing in power over periods from one century to the others.
From the 1500s till more than 150 years later, the city remained under the Ottoman Empire, thereby leaving Turkish baths and such influences. Following that, Austria ruled Hungary for so long that this city became part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Then, there was a burst of urbanization in this city with most of the famous buildings surrounding it.
However, in the 20th century, obstacles came to Budapest. During World War II, much destruction had occurred in Budapest and after that Soviet occupation continued until 1989. After 1989, Hungary became free, and modernisation began in Budapest.Culture of Budapest
Budapest is rich in culture and creativity. Old and new styles can be seen together. From Gothic to Baroque to Art Nouveau, the style of architecture varies. Some of the world’s most popular landmarks include the Hungarian Parliament building, Buda Castle, and Fisherman’s Bastion.
Hungarians love music, dance, and theater. They enjoy classical music and folk dance. There are several theaters, concert halls, and art galleries in Budapest. Traditional Hungarian folk music is unique and beautiful, and you can hear it at cultural events and festivals.
There are also the food aspects so profoundly tied up in Hungarian culture, for instance, the dishes which are goulash-a stew, rich and meaty and containing potatoes and paprika-and chimney cakes, sweetmeats shaped like spiral pastries.
Budapest is the central economic hub of Hungary. Since the collapse of communism in 1989, the city has been witnessing rapid growth and has, over the years, come to become a significant finance hub in Central Europe. Significant industries of Budapest include finance, tourism, technology, and manufacturing.
Now many international companies have their offices in Budapest, employing more people and attracting additional investment. In addition, the highly educated workforce and general business environment of the city are also among its strengths. Recently, the technology sectors have risen significantly, and many startups have made their base in Budapest.
Budapest Tourism
Millions of people visit the city every year to see historic sites, beautiful buildings, and unique attractions. The most popular destinations in Budapest are:Thermal BathsBudapest thermal baths attract millions of visitors due to the natural hot springs under the city. Local favorites Széchenyi and Gellért Baths attract visitors from all over.The Danube RiverFor starters, the Danube has both nice views of Buda and Pest, particularly by night when the buildings all become lit up.
Ruin BarsIn Jewish Quarters, there exist known ruin bars — those small-time bars that people begin opening in old buildings but that have been abandoned by mankind. Each bar features quite distinct furniture and colors along with decorations, and then finally becomes unique.
Museums and ArtBudapest has many museums showing Hungarian art, history, and culture. The best include the Museum of Fine Arts and the Hungarian National Gallery.
FestivalsThere are numerous festivals held throughout the year in Budapest, including the Sziget Festival, Europe’s biggest music festival, and the Budapest Wine Festival.
Conclusion
Budapest is rich in history and full of the culture of life. Budapest has great architecture, fine food, a good economy, and lots of interesting things to do. You want to relax in a thermal bath, explore old buildings, or enjoy local music and food; Budapest has got it all.

arrive in istanbul airport early morning get your bearings need to snag wifi to download mapsme for turkey forgot to tackle that one in sri lanka before takeoff the wifi here takes some hoops jump them get cash exchange figure out transport to hostel neighborhood get through passport control.
part of this on the move/keeping the senses sharp has to do with handling what is often initial aversion. i arrived in istanbul the way i have in a handful of other cities: tired, a tad confused, feeling an outsider, accompanied by a little guy on my shoulder asking me why i’m doing this.
you could be home eating a cheeseburger. you could wake up in your own bed. you could be on a beach in thailand. you could be in the laotian mountains where your ten dollar bills lasted all day. etc.
you get over that hill and at sunset you find you aren’t thinking those thoughts — you haven’t been during this whole walk come to think of it. where did they go? the next morning the neighborhood is a little more yours, on account of the walk you took last night. a few more of the signs make sense. by lunch time your heart is where your feet are, and now you are traveling again. world/oyster.

fuckin earthquakes. istanbul the second area, bangkok the first, i’m visiting after a pretty dramatic earthquake event. whistling past the graveyard. nobody died but it was big and a decent amount of people got hurt jumping out of buildings. these people are traumatized by earthquakes. in 1999 a quake killed 18,000 in northwest turkey. a real doozy in the southeast in 2023 claimed over 50,000 lives. i saw people during my visit sleeping in tents in parks, the most recent shakeup reminding them all too clearly that the plates of the earth under istanbul are locked. it’s a “powder keg”, as one professor put it. some day the building stress will burst.
—
i hopped off a bus one day before my destination because i thought i might die if i didn’t get some bread i was hungry particularly for bread with some of the chunk of butter i had in my backpack for just such an occasion and without having a clue that i was close to something cool i turned a corner and stumbled across a massive, beautiful wall that’s part of the aqueduct of valens, a 4th century roman structure. and that is kind of wild, being from somewhere where nothing is old, to stumble upon such a thing in the middle of a city.
—
there’s a passage in orhan pamuk’s red haired woman, that i can’t find because i no longer have the book, about seeing old men in istanbul passing their days on cafe patios. this is a signature feature of this part of the world to me, as little time as i have spent in it. i found the men in athens charming for it. on a morning walk many people are clearly in motion to get somewhere: tourists to a site, young people to work. fellas in their 60’s or more are just sitting on stools in their black jackets smoking smegs and having espresso. shooting the shit with their dudes. it’s 50 and sunny and breezy. why not. i join them and it’s nice.
—
i had been told the neighborhood of kadikoy was an essential visit in istanbul. i asked the man working the hostel if there’s anything i should do there.
“you should not have a plan this go to kadikoy. just sometimes is better no plan. walk around.”
music to my ears my friend. a great afternoon spent.
—
a hostel owner said when he opened his spot in sultanahmet in the early 90’s there were only a few of them around. not many tourists came then, but he did have some cool stories about caravans of hippies that used to meet there before driving to nepal every year. now sultanahmet is densely packed with tourist accommodations. he gave me a couple cups of cay as we chatted before i checked out. on a day committed to sightseeing touristy type stuff i drank maybe eight cups of cay. they are served in very small portions. you are meant to consume many tasty little cups.
“‘you drink cay all day.’‘yes of course life is short.’”
—
polis brigades — i just happened to be staying in the neighborhood of ferikoy when and where, according to the bbc, “50,000 police officers deployed to the city as authorities attempt(ed) to crack down on May Day protests…Public transport was shut down to stop people reaching Taksim Square, where demonstrations have been banned since 2013.”
in some sense people protest on may day every year in the name of labor rights, but this year the government is a little more on edge. mainly because president erdogan’s government arrested the mayor of istanbul on trumped up corruption charges. apparently corrupt assholes who have manipulated power for a quarter century don’t like it when popular mayors voice dissent and it happens to be dissent that the masses agree with. some 400 protestors were arrested.
all i wanted to do was get a bus to a ferry location so i could go to the princes islands. blockages on the streets made this difficult. my bag was checked to walk across one road. impossible to get a taxi. i just walked to the ferry but since that was downhill and not exactly short i was really hoping after the day trip the shenanigans would be in enough of the past that i could taxi back up it, but that was also not possible.
i feel quite often, in life and not just traveling, like the very confused old man i saw at the cordoned off kabatas bus stop. he had a bag of groceries. i watched him on and off for a couple minutes while he glanced around and then ahead again at the shut off access. he appeared stupefied. i imagine him leaving home with a story playing in his head about how he would get home from the river and the way he would get home from the river was a bus station that operated with incredible reliability. all the sudden standing, wondering why the world is not doing what he had thought it would. perplexed.
a good hike and pleasant company on the island. raki with a view.
—
at aga hamami men have been getting scrubbed down by men here in non-gay fashion simce 1454. turkish bath style. azim with tender loving care gave life to my muscles sore from miles and miles of concrete walking.
after the bubble rub he told me to sit up and was pouring bowls of water over me. baptism-esque. he said “ready” and without even thinking of what the question might mean i said yes — in for a penny in for a pound — and he dumped a bowl of cold water down the front of my shorts, smiled at me, and said “good morning”.
it’s substantially more comfortable to do meandering travel days when it’s not 95 degrees. my entire belongings weigh quite little and i don’t mind carrying them around a city at 55 degrees. i can bounce around istanbul cafes and parks and bars for the whole day with my bag on my back before making the night bus. show up in the morning in sofia, bulgaria find a coffee shop read a bit sightsee a little and check into the hostel in the afternoon. in southeast asia i would have been, well, smellier, with that strategy.
at 8:11 on a saturday in sofia no coffee shops are open. i stopped into one that two people were seated outside of, having coffee. the door was open. the emplyees looked at me and said “we are not open yet.” a place literally called coffee lab wasn’t open either. how do these people do it. i do not know. sometime around 9 i stumbled upon a fix for my addiction.
—
if i drive 7 hours from my home people will be dressed and talk very like where i left. this idea is foreign in europe. languages, or at minimum accents, change quickly. it’s almost as if our culture was too young before modernity made interconnectedness the norm for things to silo off much.
in a crowded istanbul beer hall full of my peers i noted only one person that was not covered head to toe in neutral colors. in sofia they wear colors, some of them haphazardly combined. some clothes remind you of that store the buckle. this is not a compliment. it’s painting with a broad brush but let’s just say the bulgarians of sofia are not as pretty as the turks of istanbul. then again, bulgaria is not a pretty sounding word, and there’s that adage about how people will become their names.
—
i arrived sick which is not so much fun. sick is when it’s really nice to be at home. on your couch. it’s not a joy to be in the public. you feel like you’re gross to them and you don’t want to see them either. i saw a doctor for fifty bucks and he helped me out a bit.
—
“I don’t mean a casual desire for travel, not a tourist’s curiosity for sites and landmarks and languages and new faces, but a precise and uncomplicated conviction that the world was available to me.” — i think this is also from that pamuk book but now i can’t figure it out. and i feel that way often now. out here.
—
i happened to be sitting in a sofia coffee shop when i read in the return by hisham matar a passage about an italian architect who consulted on works on the st. alexander nevsky cathedral in sofia. serendipitous. i walked over because that’s a nice little low energy activity for someone under the weather and i like sitting in houses of worship.
i have been doing this in buildings belonging to a number of faiths on a couple different continents lately. the instinct of most secular americans is to start off with one’s problems of the metaphysical claims of various religions— but if you can just get over yourself enough and just sit there they are often a quite nice place to be.
—
when people at home ask me what people are “like” somewhere i often say something like people are nice everywhere and a smile is universal. a smile is not, in fact, universal. i felt very much like i was in eastern europe once i got to sofia. a number of smiles met stone walls. people aren’t mean. they just aren’t all opening up to you and that’s fine. i lived with an estonian couple once who was not unkind but who took a long time to warm up to me and actually have a conversation, considering there was only me and one other person they interacted with daily. us living in a secluded farmhouse.
—
both the cashier at the mini mart who struck up a conversation with me that began with the powers of the bacteria in bulgarian yogurt and had a dabble in the minnesota timberwolves and the bulgarian-post-punk-looking hostel worker said a day trip to plovdiv, the oldest continuously inhabited city in europe, was a “must”. these are the types of people you listen to, and they were right.
another border another random selection of me for bag searching. the jacked border patrol guy presents as “i listen to serbian jordan peterson”. not a compliment. he looked personally insulted when he asked what i was doing in serbia and i said just traveling. i had to strongly fight the urge to tell him to look at all the fucking stamps from the last couple months in the passport he kept waving up and down and staring at my picture in.
—
david’s wife died seven years ago, his kids are now both at university, and he recently retired, so now he does things like bicycle the entire length of the danube and share an evening of large red wine decanters and mugs of beer with generally disheveled thirty something backpackers from sauk centre, minnesota.
—
the belgrade fortress makes clear why the city has been fought over some 115 times in its history. destroyed and rebuilt 40–45 times. it’s prime location, resting on top of a hill right where the sava and danube rivers connect.
i am left to wonder what that does to a people. how one could possibly argue it wouldn’t lead to some ingrained difference in constitution for its population. how many of these people have family stories? how many have personal stories? i remember shooting pool in thailand with a shellshocked kid — i call him kid because of who i am now but he was a man, early 20’s — who just got done with his military service in israel and when i asked what his position was he said combat soldier and he had ghosts in his eyes. hard to imagine what he’s seen or how it could be left behind.
—
on hostel courtesy. if you’re leaving at 5am then yes you should prepack the night before so to not be fumbling around while people are mid-snooze.
smiles not universal. i was told the 74 and the 72 go to the national park outside of town but the city bus driver on the 74 says no when i ask if he is going to the national park and he closes the door behind me anyways. then i ask him if the 72 goes there and he just shrugs a “who could know” shrug. cool.
spent the first part of the day walking to a city park and the danube beach instead. stopped at a museum in the afternoon and spent a good five or six hours bouncing around old town reading in bars and on cafe patios alone. found a fernet. having an actual bar instead of only tables is a feature of american culture that makes being alone much easier. and easier to meet people. it’s casual to strike up a conversation with the bartender or a fellow bar sitter. it takes a lot more intrusion to approach a table — hey can we be frens!?!?
—
in eastern europe the local population is wholesome park participants. people spend time in parks. it’s nice. i have lived in msp for eight years and not once has someone asked me to meet them in a park to hang out. have a picnic.
very, very committed to statues as a culture. some of the angels appear to be tormented by their task. role, maybe. at eternity it maybe ceases being a task.
—
“perhaps these people are especially devout. look at them in church filling it up on any old day.” i thought that to myself. i then realized it is sunday and not yet noon. time and days have lost themselves two months in to backpacking. eat when i’m hungry. sleep when i fall into it. i drink coffee at absolutely any hour. bus when i’m ready to go.
—
in minneapolis we have the warehouse district which is meant to describe a neighborhood with repurposed old buildings for modern, hip use. the official warehouse district website uses descriptives like “rich culture”, “eclectic”, and “dynamic urban atmosphere”. but the interior of most of those establishments carries the aesthetic taste of white bread with miracle whip. the warehouse district is where culture goes to die. sanitized into submission.
in budapest there is a trend for the last quarter century of ruin bars. they embrace the decay of the buildings, house mismatched furniture, and the decor is like a dive bar regular went to a thrift store on a pound of coke and then collaged the walls. the ruin bars are fantastic. i have described tom’s burnt down cafe on madeline island as mad max meets jimmy buffet concert, and if tom’s was just dropped in the middle of a city it would qualify as a ruin bar. that is the closest thing i can think of to this.
—
i take it as a personal offense that they serve weak ass coffee in budapest in hipster coffee shops. like americano as hot bean water even when you pay for an extra shot.
something about budapest was eating at me after a couple days. not just the weak coffees. maybe just a me thing. who knows. the buildings and museums are undeniably striking. it is a remarkable city. i stayed in one of the cutest hostels i’ve ever seen. sunsets at the river are quite an experience. but something. maybe the crowds, who seem less like travelers than people who are obviously on vacation. an important distinction. maybe feeling like a mark. always paying for the view and not the product. i am glad i went. i was ready to leave. next, croatia.
you can watch the sun set in all sorts of ways. can gaze at the horizon it’s dropping off. can look to the horizon opposite and see the shade darken incrementally. you can stare at the leaves on a tree when they go from lime to mint to night. can watch a line move up the wall of a building until it’s gone and then when it’s gone it really is gone. it is. wrecks me every time. i saw a young girl maybe 12 taking a picture of a flower with a camera not a phone but a camera and that made me feel better.

What to do with a week in Budapest? Gaining attention for its Ruin Bars, beautiful architecture, and accessible transportation, Budapest is a great addition to your travel bucket list. Whether cramming in visits to multiple historic sites into one day or taking long breaks to relax at world famous bathhouses, the city has many opportunities for any traveler and a week is the perfect amount of time to explore it all.
The first thing to note when traveling to Budapest is that the city is a combination of three previously independent cities: Buda, Pest, and Obuda. Buda and Pest are divided by the famous Danube River, a peaceful landmark to walk alongside that also serves as a pathway to other cities via day trips by boat. Exploring both sides of the Danube is absolutely essential.
On the Buda side, sightsee at castle hill with its many museums and go back in time to Hungarian history. Take your time in the Hungarian National Gallery and Matthias Church taking in artwork and make sure to grab a pastry at Ruszwurm Confectionery, one of Budapest’s oldest bakeries. Walk around below the castle to see a more calm side of Budapest and don’t be afraid to explore!
On the Pest side, make sure to walk around the Parliament building which grandly overlooks the Danube. The opera house is also a great place to take a tour and listen to a musical sample, but be sure to book the tour in English in advance, especially in high tourist season (or, settle for the tour in Spanish, French, Italian, or German). Wander the galleries at the Museum of Fine Art and Kunsthalle, and take a look at Hero’s Square for even more history and art. If you’re looking for nightlife, Budapest’s Ruin Bars certainly won’t disappoint with their bustling maze-like interiors and colorful light displays.
The city is incredibly well connected; tourists can easily take buses, trains, and trolleys to get to just about any destination. Don’t miss out on taking the oldest electric metro system to a bathhouse and relaxing at one of Budapest’s many natural hot springs. There are options for everyone on both sides of the city to enjoy the warm water as ‘Budapesti’ (Budapest natives) have been doing for centuries.
Budapest, with its tumultuous history, is notably a city to learn a lot from when you visit. Signs of the Austro-Hungarian empire are everywhere-–from the massive parliament building to over the top gilded cafes. The Soviet occupation of Hungary is also still present, and its four decades of history loom over the city, which was largely devastated after WWII.
If you’re lucky to get the chance to visit Budapest, take your time to explore the city completely rather than quickly jumping around tourist attractions. You won’t regret learning from locals and getting a full experience of the city.
Safe travels!

Our stay in Budapest was awesome. We explored a lot of the city in the first several days, soaking in the history and enjoying the hot sunny weather, and then unfortunately the rain set in and we had a couple of lazy days to end our stay.
We opted to stay in an Air BnB for this destination which was a cozy little apartment in the centre of the city, close to tons of restaurants, stores, and attractions, as well as metro and tram stations. Air BnBs book up fast and so we had booked this a month or more prior, however, our dates did change and so we ended up switching to a different accommodation for our last three days which was just a few hundred meters down the road. As I’ve mentioned before, I love Air BnBs for stays longer than a few days purely because of kitchen access. It is so nice to have the flexibility of making dinner, snacks, a coffee in the morning, rather than always looking for a place to go which also adds up financially.
One of my favourite things to do in any European city is participating in a walking tour. I love doing them in our first couple of days as I find it helps orient you to the city, and you often get some helpful tips and recommendations from your tour guide. Every European city we’ve been to offers several free walking tours, and they’ve all be awesome. The guides are generally locals, often have postsecondary education in history or a related field, and are really passionate and knowledgeable about what they do. I find these by doing a simple Google search for “free walking tours in X city”, but I have found that “freetour.com” is a really good one which aggregates tours offered by different companies, shows reviews, allows you to filter for language, and has a very easy to use app.
In Budapest we did three tours, all through the tour company “Generation Tours”, and they were fabulous. The first was a general tour of the city where we learned some basic Hungarian, the importance of validating your public transit ticket before getting on to avoid very steep fines, and walked by/learned about many large sites such as Liberty Square, Parliament, St. Stephen’s Basilica. We also walked by “Shoes on the Danube Bank”, a Holocaust memorial from 2005, comprised of metal shoes lined up at the edge where many Jewish people were shot and bodies pushed into the river. The shoes are sculpted after real shoes from concentration camps. The shoes were left behind as they were valuable and a needed resource for soldiers during the war. I didn’t take pictures as it didn’t feel right to do so, but this is a really touching memorial and you can see photos with a quick google search.
Our second tour was of Buda Castle. It took us through the history of the city, the changing of hands, through the castle district including the famous Fisherman’s Bastion with views over the city, and ending at the castle itself. You can certainly explore this area on your own, it’s easy to get to, but I do think you get so much more out of your time there with a guide to help provide background and point out details.
The last tour we did here was of the Jewish Quarter which toured us to a few beautiful synagogues and through the Jewish area, discussed Hungary’s role throughout WWII, and shared stories of important individuals who helped save many Jewish people during those dark years. A lot of walking, a lot of information, but a great way to learn about the country’s culture and history.
We spent one of our days taking advantage of the warm sunny weather and exploring City Park. This is a huge area right on the metro line with large green spaces, playgrounds, and little cafes. It was lovely to wander through and sit and enjoy an iced coffee. We also explored Vajdahunyad Vara, an 1896 castle with gorgeous architecture.
At the far end of the park is Budapest Zoo and Botanical Garden which we spent a couple hours wandering through. I don’t always like supporting zoos, and they tend to be less exciting after seeing many of the animals in the wild on our South African Safaris and Asian monkey encounters… but nonetheless it was a really nice way to spend some time outdoors, the gardens/foliage in the area was beautiful. Outside of the zoo is also the famous Szechenyi Thermal Bath but we did not go in partly because we didn’t realize this is where it was so we didn’t have bathing suits with us, but also because we had planned to attend a different thermal bath instead.
We spent a rainy afternoon exploring the House of Terror, a museum in the building that once used as the headquarters during the fascist and communist regimes. It is an incredibly well-done museum with interesting displays and lots of background history, information shared in different formats such as historic footage and recent interviews with subtitles and audio translations, artifacts such as newspaper clippings and soldiers uniforms, and laminated information sheets at the entrance of each room. The basement is a cellar where prisoners were tortured, held, and killed. It is an eerie excursion, and one certainly worth doing.
There is certainly no shortage of restaurants in Budapest, although I will say that compared to some of our previous destinations, there is not as much variety. Hungarian food is flavourful and rich, often heavy on the meat and carbs, light on the vegetables, especially raw ones (similar to our next two stops as well). We of course tried all of the classics including goulash (a rich beef soup often served with bread on the side to soak up that delicious broth), chicken paprikash often served over dumplings that remind me of gnocchi in texture but have very little flavour themselves, and schnitzel. From our experiences, Hungarians do soup/stew very well — packed with flavor, they warm you from the inside out. Somehow we managed to go the week without sampling langos which is a circle of fried dough often topped with sour cream and cheese… sounds delish and I’m not sure how we missed that. Doner kebabs/shawarmas are also common and never fail to be a delicious, quick, cheap lunch. And there are bakeries that produce really tasty freshly baked bread, as well as a variety of pastries, my favourite being whole grain croissants filled with baked plums… a recommendation from my mom which quickly became my go-to when enjoying a cappuccino and sitting on a patio people watching. I’m not a huge beer person, but we of course sampled the local selections as well.
When you search most affordable places to travel, Hungary and Prague are always on the list. This is partly why we chose to visit these places and spend a week+ on them, especially given it is near the end of our travels and we anticipated budget being more important. Compared to many places in Europe, Budapest and Prague were certainly affordable, however, like many places in Europe and worldwide, they have been heavily impacted by Covid and inflation. When comparing menus from 1–2 years ago to their current menu on their Google page, we quickly saw a pattern of prices going up by 50%, sometimes doubling, sometimes even tripling. And so while these places were not outrageously expensive, they were more expensive than we had expected, especially with regard to food and alcohol. Public transit, as well as taxis/rideshare apps, remain quite inexpensive, and attraction tickets were pretty standard.
One of our tour guides told us that the thermal baths are a wonderful thing to do while visiting Budapest, however that there are many of them and some are very overpriced and overrun with tourists, taking away much of the charm and authenticity. He recommended Palatinus Strand Baths on Margaret Island as the best one to visit, as it is popular with locals, very reasonably priced, and beautiful. As I had wanted to see Margaret Island already we planned to follow his recommendation. Unfortunately, that entire plan got rained out. We also planned to do a cruise down the Danube river (either during the day or for sunset with some prosecco), but this was also rained out. Sure, you can do these things in the rain, and some of the baths are indoors, but ultimately we decided that if we were going to do them we wanted to really enjoy them, and being cold and wet would put too much of a damper (literally) on things, making us feel not as great about spending the money on them. We had planned to do these things in the second half of our week there, and we hoped the weather would clear… I guess it’s just a reason to go back! Not that we needed another reason because we really loved Budapest. The amount of history is incomparable to Canada, the buildings are stunning, the prices are reasonable, there are beautiful green spaces, and the atmosphere in the city is lively and draws you in. I’ll wrap up this post by sharing photos of just some of the street art that you see all over the city:

Before visiting Budapest, I had no idea that this was one of the 25 most visited cities in Europe or that this city was the most central point in Europe. I knew very little or nothing about the Hungarian people or Budapest. All the places I visited and my experiences formed my vision of the Hungarian people and Budapest city.
This article is dedicated to all the places that I consider a must-see on a visit to Budapest, but it is also an article dedicated to the history of the Hungarian people and Budapest.
Today we know the capital Budapest by this name, but the truth is that Buda and Pest are two different areas, which like their name, they were not always unified. The Chain Bridge connected the two halves of the city in 1849. However, it was not until 1873 that Budapest's name became one; Pest is the generally flat eastern portion of the city of Budapest, covering about two-thirds of Budapest is separated from Buda by the Danube River. Buda, in turn, is located in the western part and is composed mainly of hills and forests.

When I was studying Geography, Budapest and Bucharest were both capitals of countries and Belgrade was the capital of Yugoslavia. I’d often have to think carefully to decide that Budapest was the capital of Hungary and Bucharest was the capital of Romania. After spending time in both, I wondered how such similar-sounding cities could be so different.
I love Budapest. I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t. For me, the fact that it has thermal baths is enough of a drawcard. It doesn’t need anything else. But the beautiful bridges, the beautiful river, the beautiful buildings, the beautiful railway stations, the beautiful dogs: everything is beautiful.
Just look at the difference in accommodation!

Before I traveled to Budapest I never thought that I would enjoy their food that much. My first impression of the city was very favorable, but after spending there two more days I felt like I was falling in love with the city.
And one of the reasons why is its food.
If you read just about any travel guide about visiting Hungary, you will find that when visiting Budapest one absolutely must try Gulash soup. Pretty much the same way the guides insist on you visiting October Fest when in Germany.
Unless you absolutely can not imagine your life without a stew of meat and vegetables, you can skip Gulash in Budapest the same way you can skip drinking overpriced beer in München while watching drunken American tourists puking all over the place during the October Fest.
You would enjoy your German beer so much better sipping it in one of the German Biergarten on a sunny day.
Madal Cafe
Madal is a specialty cafe in Budapest that received its name after the peace philosopher Sri Chinmoy, whose childhood nickname was “Madal”. They have roasted coffee every week in their specialty micro roastery near Budapest since 2014.
Sri Chinmoy is a spiritual teacher who was both a philosopher and an excellent sprinter, winning the ashram championship for 16 consecutive years. In the cafe itself, they put a stature of Sri, which I found unique and interesting.

Today I’ll be your guide on a journey through culture and cuisine!
Buda-Best stole my heart and became a safe place for healing scars. Whenever I face a difficult period in my life, my curing place wipes my tears, when I escape I run to you. Your elegant streets bring harmony to my soul, give me solutions when I question what my future steps should be, and help me overcome what is better left in the past. You can almost feel the history and breathe the love of its stories. Anyone can be skeptical about the country but never of its capital.
“You can’t buy happiness, but you can buy a plane ticket to Budapest. And that’s pretty much the same thing.”
I spent a lot of my childhood and teenage years in Budapest. I always told my little brother, with whom I visited a million times, that when he grows up I want him to take a backpack and go out into the wide world to find his happiness… but that he shouldn’t forget his home.
My home town is located only 100 km from Budapest. I was living between two cultures, Slovak and Hungarian. I believe everyone has a certain bond to a country of their origin, but I have to admit that Bratislava is not as magnificent as Budapest. It’s just…

The Marauding Mummy

My inner germaphobe recoiled in horror as I dipped my toes into the steamy, chlorine-free waters of Szechenyi Baths. Nobody else seemed to mind that this place was the perfect breeding ground for a multitude of horrifying drug-resistant bacteria. White and caramel-colored bodies sat placidly in the armpit grease-filled pools, enveloped by rising steam, but a few were busy sucking in their tummies and sticking out their chests for the ‘gram.
“Weeeeeeeeee!” my 5-year-old screamed as he dive-bombed into a pool outdoors, splashing murky water onto several flawlessly made-up faces. The aspiring models waded away, scowling.
The city’s claim to fame — its thermal springs — have long attracted scores of admirers. First came the Romans, who established their regional capital here over 2,000 years ago after Marcus Aurelius discovered that his soldier’s wounds healed faster when they bathed in these hot springs, and then the Turks who, during their occupation in the 16th and 17th century, constructed a handful of public baths which are still being used today.
Among the dozens of baths around Budapest, Szenchenyi is one of the largest and most popular spa complexes in Europe, hosting everyone from Madonna to Richard Nixon. In this handsome building more than a hundred years old, you can find indoor pools with temperatures that range form hot to only-Satan-bathes-here…
…and three open-air pools — only the latter is open to kids under 14.
So there I was, on a chilly May morning, shivering in my bikini. I couldn’t decide which was more appealing — hypothermia or staph infection — but my kids chose for me, having jumped into the pool immediately after disrobing.
As soon as I found myself relaxing in the water, my kids pulled me to the centre of the pool (correction: whirlpool) where we spun around like a a pair of socks in a tumble dryer and I almost fractured my hip bone trying to escape.
After toweling off, we went to Heroes’ Square to cower before the fierce countenance of the Magyars, the ancestors of present day Hungarians . The Magyars — skilled horsemen who are said to have originated from Central Asia — were the most fearsome warriors after the Vikings. I felt a little thrill knowing that my Asian brothers managed to ride all the way here over a thousand years ago, pillaging and conquering towns along the way…
…but the statues bear more resemblance to Harrison Ford than any Asian I’ve known.
Anyway, I totally get why the Magyars wanted to settle here.
Hungary is flat like the Steppes, and a river winds placidly through the capital, carrying with it wealth and news from other parts of Europe. The Danube, however, was not blue as Johann Strauss has promised, but rather the colour of a day-old baby’s poop (which explains why nobody swims there). That did not stop us from sailing with Lagenda Sightseeing Cruise, marveling at some of the city’s flamboyant landmarks, many of which were built in 1896 to commemorate the 1000th anniversary of the Magyars’ arrival and to thumb their nose at their rivals, Vienna.
One of the most grandiose of these is the Fisherman’s Bastion, which is a misnomer since it has no fishermen, but rather, hundreds of tourists all jostling for the perfect picture. This Disney-like monument reclines atop a hill and is purely ornamental, rather than functional.
Its centerpiece, Matthias Church, is way older, dating back to the Middle Ages. It is the site of many royal marriages and coronations…and this is starting to sound like a very dry history lesson so we’ll stop here.
The kings lived nearby, in ated a female servant, salvation is only a short walk away).While I’d love to pay a visit to the king and swig Buda Castle, presumably for convenience (I mean, if he has killed a blood relative for the throne or impregn palinka with him, monarchy ended in 1918 and the royal residence has now been converted into a library and several museums.
The Hungarian Parliament, which was also built as part of the millennial celebrations, makes the Houses of Parliament in London look modest. We booked a guided tour, and were herded like cows around the opulent interior, bristling with hand-carved statues, ceiling frescoes and convenient workplace facilities like a post office, a clinic and — perhaps the most important of all — a hair salon (because God forbid one has a bad hair day during a parliament sitting).
But perhaps the most intimidating room of all was the dome hall, where two guards holding drawn sabres stood watch over the crown jewels. Because it must be incredibly tiresome to stand still and have tourists buzz around you like flies day in and day out, they were ready to flay anyone who gets too close — a poor lady got the fright of her life when a guards sprang into action, snarling and waving his weapon (which he no doubt sharpens every day) in her face.
Like, we get it dude, your life sucks. Stop taking it out on others.
We had our first taste of Hungarian food and liquor at the Great Market Hall, where mountains of fiery red and yellow paprika — used liberally in Hungarian cuisine, from soups to cakes — graced shopfronts, while salami and sausages made from mangalica, a traditional Hungarian delicacy made from a local woolly pig, dangle from the ceilings. There were also shops selling jars upon jars of pickled everything — including melons — and a bakery selling freshly made, piping hot strudels. I bought one stuffed with cottage cheese and it was beautiful.
After a satisfying round of made-in-China souvenir shopping upstairs, we sat down for lunch in Fakanal Etterem, one of the more expensive restaurants in the market hall. The place is as touristy as it gets, with Hungarian tasting platters and roving folk musicians, but the food — which came accompanied with some salty, spicy paprika paste — was enjoyable.
Heck, I was starting to develop a certain fondness for Hungarian grub when I boldly gulped down some Unicum.
Everything about the Unicum is offensive, from its name to its taste. But just as I was about to buy a one-way ticket out of Hungary to get as far away as possible from this liquor, I had some toltott kapozsta, or traditional meat-stuffed cabbages drenched in tomato sauce, and the world was right again.
We also dropped by the Belvarosi Piac, a smaller, more authentic farmer’s market. Locals come here to shop for local produce and eat in one of the handful of casual food stalls owned by renowned Budapest chefs upstairs.
Despite its unpronounceable name, MoszkvatéЯ is a solid Russian eatery specializing in street food versions of traditional Russian cuisine. You’d think the Russians were only good for two things — mobsters and matryoshka dolls — but, no, their pelmenyi topped with caviar and sour cream is every bit as deserving of our attention too.
It is said that you can’t leave Budapest without trying langos, a favorite snack among the locals. We came upon this deep-fried dough at a summer fair, and — after apologizing to our arteries — decided to have ours doused in sour cream and grated cheese. It tasted remarkably similar to ham chim peng, the Asian doughnut that was such a regular fixture in my not-so-great childhood.
We took a cue from the food tours that regularly drop by Callas Cafe and had tea and desserts there. Situated on Andressy Ut, Budapest’s very own Champs Elysees, this gorgeous restaurant serves Hungarian pastries in art deco surroundings. I helped myself to the opera cake, an elegant chocolate confection layered with mousse and wafer, and it was as beautiful as Maria Callas, the world famous soprano who inspired it.
It took me awhile to realize that my mother’s apartment — yes, she lives there — was located in the Jewish Quarter, where 70,000 Jews were forced to live during the Nazi occupation in 1944.
Whole communities were wiped out, but the place is experiencing a revival of Jewish culture, judging from the number of new kosher restaurants in the vicinity. We loved walking around this disheveled, graffiti-sprayed neighborhood, exploring its hidden courtyards and ruin pubs — without the children, of course. Hungary may be part of Europe, but it feels different, grittier and more exotic.
We also stopped by the Dohany Utca Synagogue, Europe’s largest synagogue. Its elegant Moorish facade, however, hides a grim history. Beside it, the Garden of Remembrance stood, a mass grave for murdered Jews. Some of the victims’ names were inscribed into the weeping willow memorial nearby.
And then there is the Raoul Wallenberg Memorial, named for the Swedish consul who saved tens upon thousands of Jews during World War II by smuggling them out of trucks bound for the detention camps and into safe houses. He was eventually arrested by the Soviets for espionage and died in a gulag. But what disturbs me is that real-life heroes like him aren’t as well-known or celebrated as Iron Man or Wolverine. Their faces have disappeared, swept away by the tide of history.
It’s like they never existed.
After the excitement of the baths, we preferred to indulge in some low-key fun and relaxation with the children. So we took a tram to Margaret Island, a peaceful, car-free recreational reserve wedged in middle of the Danube. Locals come here to bike, swim and generally get away from the bustling city.
I mean, what could possibly go wrong, right? Right?!
Well, the problem began when we rented an electric buggy to check out some ruins of a church. Instead of following us, our 3-year-old clambered onto the driver’s seat in front and stepped on the pedal — accidentally it seemed, because he began screaming for help when the car propelled forward for quite a distance….before crashing into a tree.
The boy, while inconsolable, survived with minor scrapes and bruises.
But yes, Budapest is beautiful. Just don’t expect relaxation to be part of the vocabulary when you’re holidaying with kids.
STAY
New York Palace, Autograph Collection This resplendent baroque-style hotel sits within walking distance of Budapest’s top sights. Amenities include a gym, spa and pool. The in-house New York cafe has long been an institution, thanks to visiting poets and writers. Rooms are tastefully furnished, with large bathrooms, but do not that it can be quite noisy as the hotel sits at a busy intersection. Be sure to ask for a quieter room on a higher floor if you’re a light sleeper. $$$

Hi guys, I’ve decided to continue writing my travel stories on my personal blog website “Wandering Sten” for easier access for everyone. There is no need to create an account and sign in as well as monthly reading limits. Click here to read Discovering Budapest and Beyond in a Month.
It’s my first time traveling to Europe and my first destination is Budapest, the capital city of Hungary. I spent about a month here and there’s so much to say about this Hungarian capital and the country that I don’t think I can fit everything in a single post. But I’ll share a brief and informative overview of my memorable experience living in Budapest and visiting other places in Hungary.
It may be Europe, and it may be part of the European Union but it’s still an affordable city to live in. With some tricks and a diligent search on accommodation across various platforms (best if you have a local to help you find accommodation), you can find a nice place to live without breaking the bank. At the time of visiting, I was working remotely and that means my job doesn’t require me to be in a specific geographic location. I can do it anywhere from my laptop as long as I have a reliable internet connection and luckily Hungary is a developed country with excellent infrastructure including high-speed internet access everywhere.
I love Budapest and all of Hungary in general. I know people have different opinions and have said different things about the city or the nation, but personally, my time there was amazing. The people are friendly to me, the food is amazing, and it’s just a beautiful country all around. To be fair, I had a wonderful guide to show me around and help me with so many things. So whenever possible, I suggest you try to mingle with the locals or go on guided tours by the locals to get the full experience.
I visited Budapest and some other cities back in August 2017 and I’ve come back again for another two months towards the end of that year. I’ve personally visited and experienced everything that I’ve written here and all other facts and tips are thoroughly updated and checked. I plan to visit Hungary again soon and will update this guide accordingly.
Budapest is divided into districts and they are 23 of them. Some of the most popular districts to live in are district 5 which is called Belváros (which means downtown in Hungarian), districts 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, and 1 (Castle district on the Buda side). You can find most of the main tourist attractions in District 5 such as the dazzling Országház or the Hungarian Parliament Building, St Stephen’s Basilica, Shoes on the Danube monument, and the Chain Bridge. However, each district has its characteristics and charms so if you have more time check out other districts as well.
As for pricing, the accommodation in the innercity ranging from 150,000–200,000 Hungarian Forint/month (435–580 Euros) for a 1-bedroom apartment. If you don’t mind living on the outskirts of the city center, let say 20–30 minutes by public transport, you can still find cheaper accommodation ranging from 90,000–120,000 HUF month (260–350 EUR) for a 1-bedroom apartment. For my first visit to Budapest, I stayed in Frangepán ut. which is in District 13 and it’s less than 20 minutes to downtown and I also stayed in Újpest, District 4 and is a quiet and safe residential area located just 30 minutes to downtown Budapest by the public transport.
Another nice thing about Budapest is they have a really good and affordable public transport system. The network is made up of busses, trams, four underground metro lines, water busses, and suburban railways. A one-way ticket costs about 350 HUF(1 EUR) and the monthly pass costs about 9500 HUF (28 EUR).
There’s a funicular with great views that you can take for a ride up to the castle district from Clark Adam Ter. It’s not included in the regular public transport ticket but you can purchase the tickets at the entrances on the way up and down for 1200 HUF (3.5 EUR). During Christmastime, there’s an illuminated tram overlooking the Danube river and the Buda Castle that runs along the Pest riverfront, all the way from Jászai Mari tér by Margaret Bridge to Közvágóhíd. The tram is decorated in beautiful Christmas lights and it’s such a unique experience to ride in the tram. You don’t need to pay extra to ride on the Christmas tram as you can use your standard ticket fares and passes.
The first thing that I noticed when I walk around Budapest is the architecture. The whole city is filled with beautiful buildings from different historical eras in Europe such as Baroque, Art Nouveau, Bauhaus, and Socialist. All the sightseeing attractions also not far from each other and can be reached within walking distance. Here’s the list of places that I think you can’t miss while you’re visiting Budapest:
This is probably the most iconic landmark in Budapest if not the whole of Hungary. Home to hundreds of parliamentary offices, the building is a sight to behold in every angle but the best full view is from the other side of the Danube river. Certain parts of the Parliament Building is open for guided tours daily and you get to see the great vaulted hall, the richly decorated central staircase, the Hungarian Crown Jewels, and the Hungarian Holy Crown.
Heroes’ Square is another iconic monument in Budapest. You will see big statues of the Seven Chieftains of Magyar and other important Hungarian national leaders as well as the 36 m high Corinthian column in the middle of the square with Archangel Gabriel on its top holding St. Stephen’s Crown.
Just behind the Heroes’ Square, there’s the Budapest City Park, a lovely park with lots of leafy walkways for strolls with friends and family. In the area, you’ll find the gorgeous Harry-Potter-like Vajdahunyad Castle — Museum of Hungarian Agriculture and not far from it, Budapest’s most famous and picturesque thermal bath Széchenyi Bath and Budapest Zoo & Botanical Gardens.
Also known as the Great Market Hall, this is a lively and large indoor market that is popular among tourists and locals. The three-story hall is massive in size and looks grandeur from the outside. Come here to browse among the stalls and counters selling seasonal produces, freshly-baked pogácsa (the Hungarian scone), various salamis, lángos, truffle paté, pickles, gourmet jams (plum, lavender), and souvenirs.
It is a small island covered in parkland and recreational facilities situated in the middle of the Danube river. Although quite small in size, it has some medieval ruins, a small zoo, gardens, musical fountains, a water park, playgrounds, running track, swimming pools and even dance clubs! This lovely green island is a great spot for hanging out with friends and located just a few throws away from downtown Budapest. Come here for jogging, picnic with friends and family, or simply taking a romantic stroll with your special one! ;)
This is an elegant avenue connecting the downtown with Heroes’ Square and City Park. It’s almost identical to the upscale Parisian boulevards in Paris and for that reason, you can find many luxury shops and high-end restaurants on this street. Other popular attractions such as the beautiful Hungarian State Opera and House of Terror Museum also located on Andrássy Avenue.
Overlooking the Danube river and across the Pest side of the city, Buda Castle is probably Budapest’s crown jewel. This world heritage site is located in the Castle District/Hill, here you can also find the Royal Palace, Fishermen’s Bastion, and Matthias Church — all are beautiful sightseeing spots that you can’t miss while in Budapest. The entire district is well-preserved (some of it dated back to the Medieval era) and as you strolled the cobblestone walkways, you can find lovely old houses, museums, cozy cafes and restaurants, even do wine tasting in historic Faust Wine Cellar. For the best panoramic view of the city, head to the Fishermen’s Bastion and don’t forget to check out the Castle Bazaar and Royal Gardens for seasonal events and more dining options.
Another great spot for panoramic views of Budapest is Gellért Hill. It’s a 140-meters high dolomite rock hill located by the Danube river on the Buda side of the city. Especially popular for weekend outings, the hill is filled with trees and you can hike on its winding trails that lead up to a Citadella where the Liberty Statue stands.
One of my most favorite things to do in Budapest is trying all different kinds of food and drinks. Forget the stereotypical bland western cuisines here, Hungary has many delicious authentic dishes and Budapest, in general, has a diverse and vibrant dining scene. Though not so popular in comparison to France and Italy, Hungary also produce great quality wines and I loved them! Here’s a list of some food that I’ve tried and loved while in Budapest:
Fun fact: Lángos is the first thing that I ate when I arrived in Budapest and what a good starter it is! Considered as Hungary’s best street food, it’s a fluffy fried dough covered in cheese and other toppings such as sour cream, bacon, onion, and parsley. It’s so delicious and satisfying and you can find Lángos easily in food kiosks, cafes, or restaurants everywhere in Hungary. My favorite place to buy Lángos is from a food kiosk just by the entrance of Lehel Csarnok (Lehel Market) which is a well-known local indoor market. Prices vary depending on where you buy it and whether you have additional topping or not but generally it costs around 350–700 HUF (1–2 EUR).
This is one of the most celebrated and iconic dishes in Hungarian culinary. There are many versions of Goulash whether it’s regional or international, but essentially, it’s a rich stew made from beef (or veal and pork), potato, carrot, spices, and the world-famous Hungarian paprika. It’s a highly fulfilling and flavorful dish that you have to try when visiting Hungary.
This is another of my favorite Hungarian dish and it’s unique. It is a thick vegetable stew made from variations of lentils, potato, peas, beans, or carrot simmered and thickened by flour mixed with sour cream. I imagined this is a typical home-cooked meal for Hungarians and they’re also really easy to make. My favorite is the green-colored peas Főzelék and goes well with bread, you can find this healthy but fulfilling dish in most restaurants in Hungary.
Okay, in my opinion, all the cakes that I’ve tasted in Hungary are delightful but if I must pick one I’d choose Dobos Torte. It’s a moist sponge cake layered with chocolate buttercream and topped with caramel; it’s heavenly! Hungary has a sweet tradition of holding the annual national cake contest where each year during St. Stephen’s Day on August 20th, they pick the best cake and crown it as the “Cake of Hungary.” The recipe for the winning cake then shared with the general public and you can find the cake in almost every dessert shop, cafes, and restaurants in Hungary.
If you can’t remember how to pronounce the name of this pastry that’s okay because you’ll remember how it tastes (and made). Kürtöskalács or the Chimney Cake is a Hungarian treasure in a form of a sweet spiral strip that is spun and then wrapped around a truncated cone baked over charcoal and coated in plenty of sugar while basted with melted butter until its surface cooks to a delectable golden-brown color. How does that sound? Yummy! If you’re extra like me, you can also add additional toppings such as cinnamon, cocoa, shredded coconut (my favorite because I’m tropical), or chopped walnuts and they elevate this famous Hungarian street pastry.
Let’s talk about wines! Hungary is not as well-known in comparison to France, Italy, or the Americas in terms of wines but that’s unfortunate because they have a really good selection of red and white wines that are produced locally. Here are some of them; Egri Bikavér or Bull’s Blood (my favorite) is a bold and dry red wine originated from Eger in northern Hungary, Tokaji Aszú or King of Wines is a famous dessert wine from Tokaji region that’s sweet and can be found in most restaurants in Hungary. Another drink that you can try is Pálinka which is not a wine, but a fruit brandy originated in Hungary and also popular throughout central Europe.
Although I loved Budapest, I was lucky enough to venture beyond the capital for a bit and went to Vác and Eger; two equally fun and memorable destinations to visit! Firstly, there’s Vác which is a great and quick getaway from Budapest that’s often overlooked. The quiet riverside town has enough attractions for a day-trip from Budapest and I loved my visit here. Some places to visit are the Vác Cathedral; a big beautiful church from the Baroque era built in the 11th century, the City Hall, White Church, strolling around the quaint main square and the riverside walkways, or simply checking out local restaurants and dessert shops.
Eger is well-known for its wines, natural thermal baths, and some historical landmarks. The city is beautiful and a unique blend of Christian and Turkish cultures which is visible in its architecture. While you’re here, don’t forget to visit Eger Castle & Museum, the Main Square, Minorite Church, Archbishop’s Garden, Turkish Minaret, and if you have time, definitely go to the Eger Thermal Bath (my favorite part of Eger!) and experience the healing sensation of Hungarian thermal bath. Another great spot to visit while you’re in Eger is Szépasszonyvőlgy or The Valley of the Beautiful Maidens, a popular venue for wine tasting that has below the surface rows of wine cellars where you can drink and buy some of Hungary’s best wines.
If you haven’t been to Budapest, you need to give it a go. Hungary’s capital is often overlooked because many people choose other popular destinations such as Paris, Rome, or Amsterdam. Although it has its flaws, I am so glad that my first European city is Budapest because I love the characteristics and the overall vibes. There are still so many things that I’d love to write about my travel to Budapest and surrounding cities (like my visit to the city of Debrecen, and bar/club hopping experience in Budapest). But I’ll save it for another blog post! ;)
Let me know if you have any questions or comments, I’d be happy to help you to have a great experience as you plan to travel to Budapest.

often there will be loads of empty seats but no-one sits in them, even when the tram is busy and all the less-able-to-stand people are sitting! I haven’t figured this one out yet.
is expected in any cafe, and some restaurants. it’s nice to be helpful!
they don’t switch to English, even if you speak it VERY badly. which is great when you want to practise. but potentially embarrassing… yesterday a barman got grumpy with me because I ordered two pints of Dreher (the local beer) but he somehow thought I meant two shots of whiskey, and then he wasn’t happy because he had to pour the shots back into the bottle… oops.
watch where you walk – or you’ll get dripped on.
no broccoli in any of the supermarkets. I’ve seen a couple of them hiding at fruit & veg markets, but never in any of the supermarkets. sad me 🥦
and even if it is broke, still don’t fix it. just put it in the hallway of your apartment block and you can guarantee someone’ll have nabbed it within the hour.
a lot of the greetings mean both hello and goodbye. which means you might hear “szia!” (pronounced like see ya) for hello, and “hallo!” for goodbye. not confusing at all.
made of actual wicker! and it’s not only the old ladies that use them – many other people do, too.
or any other type of coffee. they are just regular bars (without the espresso). also, loads of coffee shops also sell wine and cocktails and stay open til the evening. I like this.

Hungary is so beautiful. It is in fact one of my ""first"" things in life. Back in 2006, when I boarded the first international flight of my life, it was destined for Budapest. The chartered plane ride from Vienna to Budapest was the most thrilling one. Cutting across winter clouds, when I first saw Budapest from over the air was enthralling. My stay there for few weeks has stayed afresh till this day.
Budapest, the heart of Hungary, is a city rich in history and culture. Among its must-visit attractions is the stunning Buda Castle, a historical castle and palace complex of the Hungarian kings, offering breathtaking views of the city. Another gem is the Parliament Building, a magnificent example of Neo-Gothic architecture, which is especially captivating when lit up at night. St. Stephen's Basilica, with its remarkable architecture and the panoramic view from its dome, is a sight to behold. For relaxation, Széchenyi Thermal Bath, the largest medicinal bath in Europe, provides a unique experience with its therapeutic waters and grand architecture.
For those who love the outdoors, Budapest offers delightful hiking opportunities. The Buda Hills, a short journey from the city center, are perfect for nature enthusiasts. Trails in the hills lead to places like János Hill, the highest point in Budapest, offering an unparalleled view of the city. The trek to Normafa, known for its scenic beauty and fresh air, is both refreshing and invigorating. This blend of urban charm and natural landscapes makes Budapest a multifaceted destination, promising unforgettable experiences to all who visit.

Nearly ten years ago, my husband and I lived in Budapest for a few months right after we were married. Every weekend, we’d pack our bags and visit a new European town or country. That was when the travel bug bit us. Fast forward to today, we were thrilled to have a wonderful opportunity to visit Budapest again. How could we possibly say no? This time, we wanted to take our son to the places where we made wonderful memories ten years ago. And of course, when you’re in Europe, visiting one city isn’t always enough. That’s how Bratislava and Vienna ended up on our itinerary as well.
Flights
First things first. To apply for a visa, you need confirmed round-trip tickets and hotel reservations for the travel dates. I know I’ve mentioned this before in my Kazakhstan blog, but it’s always worth repeating — look for cheaper flights from cities other than the one you reside in. We could have booked flights directly from Kozhikode to Budapest. But the layovers were long, which made the total travel time even longer, and the ticket prices were outrageous! The cheapest flight to Budapest from India was from Bangalore. The flight duration was shorter, and the layovers were minimal. So, we booked our flights from Bangalore. We flew to Bangalore from Kozhikode the day before and stayed overnight at a hotel near the airport. This turned out to be cheaper than booking a direct flight from Kozhikode (including both the flights to Bangalore and the hotel stay). And since we have a kid, it was much more convenient for him. Happy child = Happy Parents. It was a win-win. We booked the KLM flight from Bangalore to Budapest with a 1.5-hour layover in Amsterdam. We flew back to Bangalore from Budapest via Paris on Air France. Both flights were quite comfortable, and we had no complaints.
Stay
From our experience, Airbnb is the best stay option. It is cheaper than hotels and extremely spacious, and most rentals have a washer/dryer. That means you can carry fewer clothes and sleep in spacious rooms. Our son is a huge fan of Airbnb because of how spacious they are. Hotels simply cannot beat this offer. Of course, make sure you book an Airbnb rental with good ratings located near the city centre or one that is easily accessible via public transport.
Once our flights and accommodations were booked, the next step — the most dreaded of them all — was applying for a Schengen visa.
Schengen Visa
Let me be upfront — of all the visas I’ve applied for, the Schengen visa is the most complicated. I’m not joking when I say that one of the factors influencing the choice of our travel destinations is the complexity of the visa application process. All the countries we’ve visited in the past few years (post-COVID) have either had straightforward visa applications or were visa-free. But when the opportunity to travel back to Budapest came up around our ten-year wedding anniversary, we couldn’t say no, especially since we started our married life there.
I’m not going to go into detail about the visa application process, but I will mention a few things that helped us during our process.
To apply for a Schengen visa, you must submit your documents to the VFS application centre closest to your city of residence. We live in Kozhikode, and the nearest VFS centre that processes Schengen visas is in Kochi. However, we couldn’t find any suitable appointment dates in Kochi, so we decided to go with the next closest VFS centre — Bangalore. Coincidentally, we were planning a trip to Mysore during the Navratri holidays, so we extended our holiday to fit the visa appointment in Bangalore.
Before COVID-19, applying for a Schengen visa was simpler because we didn’t need an agent to help us block appointment dates. We could just log into our account on the VFS portal and pick the city, date, and time that suited us. This time, however, we couldn’t get any appointment dates when we tried to do it ourselves. It was disappointing because we took pride in managing our travel plans independently. In the end, we had to approach an agent to book an appointment, and to our surprise and eventual relief, the agent was able to get us dates that appeared unavailable on the portal. We finally got our dates, and they lined up perfectly with our Mysore holiday.
When you go for your visa appointment, it’s a good idea to bring extra documents beyond those listed on the VFS website. We carried copies of our marriage certificate, our son’s birth certificate, copies of our investments, all our old passports, and copies of all Schengen visas older than three years — documents that were not specifically required, but which the VFS centre appreciated us having. The VFS centre also has a photo booth (in case your photos don’t meet their standards), photocopy machines, and printers, just in case you forget to bring a document. So, it’s helpful to keep digital copies of all your documents so you can easily access and print them if needed.
We received our passports stamped with the visas within a few days of application.
Now, it was time to travel!
Our First Destination — Budapest
Although Amsterdam was our first port of entry into Europe, it was a short layover. After waiting through a long immigration line, we rushed to catch our connecting flight to Budapest.We reached Budapest at around 12 PM. Since we finished our immigration at our first port of entry — Amsterdam — we collected our luggage and passed through customs. We were to stay in Budapest for five days, visit Bratislava and Vienna, and then return to Budapest for a day before flying back to India. So, we purchased a two-week travel pass at the airport. This pass provides unlimited use of public transport (metro, bus, and tram) for 14 days in Budapest. There are also single tickets, one-day passes, three-day passes, and monthly travel passes, but sadly, no weekly passes. The two-week pass worked out to be the cheapest option for our 6-day overall stay. If you plan to stay in Budapest for more than three days, get the two-week pass. Don’t buy a three-day pass and then single-day passes for the extra days, as the price difference between the three-day and two-week passes is minimal. If you buy single tickets each time you use public transport, you’ll lose both time and money. One thing you should know about most European cities is that you will rarely need to use a taxi/cab. The public transport system is so well-connected that you’ll be constantly hopping on and off metros, buses, or trams throughout your stay. So, a travel pass makes more sense than individual tickets. Also, think of the time you’ll save. Imagine having to purchase a ticket every time you use public transportation. It simply does not make sense.
With the travel pass, we took the 200E bus to Kőbánya-Kispest M and then transferred to the M3 Metro line to get closer to our accommodation. We stayed in an Airbnb just a three-minute walk from Kalvin Square (Kálvin Tér) Metro station (this falls on the M3 metro line).
There is also a 100E bus that goes directly from the airport to the city centre, but this is the only transport service that is NOT included in the travel pass. Since we had the pass, we skipped it and took the 200E bus instead. The 200E bus stops just outside the airport exit. You don’t need to validate your two-week pass on the bus, but make sure to keep it with you at all times. There are regular checks, and you’ll need to show your pass if asked. Once we reached Kőbánya-Kispest M, we transferred to the M3 metro line and travelled to Kálvin Tér. At metro stations, there are no automated ticket validators. Instead, you’ll need to show your pass to the staff member near the escalators, who will quickly scan it before letting you through.
We reached our metro station, walked to our Airbnb, and self-checked in. After that, we took the day off to relax.
Getting a Local Sim
We made sure our international roaming was activated before we left India. We needed data for the first hours around the city since we did not want to buy a SIM card at the airport (expensive). We visited a local Vodafone store in the city the very next day and bought a local SIM. It was around INR 2500, which got us 6 GB of data for 30 days around Europe.
Sightseeing in Budapest
We travelled in November, which meant it was cold and there were fewer tourists — which worked to our advantage. However, the drawback was that we had to layer up every time we stepped out, which was frustrating the first few days, but later, we got used to it. We had three layers. Our regular clothes, a sweatshirt/sweater on top and a final jacket. We also had gloves, a scarf, and a beanie. We used regular walking shoes, which were quite enough since there was no snow or rain.
Places we visited in Budapest –
As with most of my travel blogs, I’m not going to dive into the details of our itinerary or write in detail about the places we visited. Instead, I’m going to simply list the places we explored each day. We traveled with our 4-year-old son, so if you’re wondering how many places you can cover with a kid in a day, this should give you a good idea.
Day 1 –
1. Hungarian Parliament Building Viewpoint
2. Mathias Church
3. Fishermen’s Bastion
4. Buda Castle and Old Town
5. Szechenyi Chain Bridge
Day 2 –
1. Gellert Hill (Closed due to renovation)
2. Vaci Utca — for shopping
3. Corvinus University
Day 3 –
1. Shoes on the Danube Bank
2. Central Market
3. Vajdahunyad Castle
4. Heroes Square
Day 4 –
1. Ferris Wheel of Budapest
2. Vaci Utca for the second time
3. Christmas Markets around the city
Day 5 –
Budapest to Bratislava
Our Second Destination — Bratislava
Our next stop was the city of Bratislava in Slovakia. We didn’t book any local travel in advance, so we visited the Keleti-Pályaudvar railway station in Budapest, a few stops away from where we stayed, and bought our train tickets to Bratislava just the day before leaving for Bratislava. This worked out cheaper for us. We also reserved seats by paying a little extra. This may not be necessary during the off-season because the trains are quite empty, and you can choose any seat, but during peak season, I suggest reserving seats. Kids under 6 travel for free! It took us 2.5 hours to reach Bratislava by train from Budapest.
We were staying in Bratislava for three days, so we bought the three-day travel pass at the railway station. The pass gives you unlimited bus and tram rides within the city. There is no metro in Bratislava, but trams and buses connect the station to the city centre. Make sure to validate your pass during your first ride. Once validated, it’s enough to do it just once, as the three days are counted from your first trip.
We stayed in an Airbnb very close to St. Michael’s Gate. The city is much smaller than Budapest, and most sightseeing within the city can be done on foot. However, visiting Devin Castle takes about 40 minutes by bus. You can use your travel pass for the bus ride there.
Places we visited –
1. Devin Castle (must visit for breathtaking views of the Danube) — Highly Recommended
2. Bratislava City Centre — St Stephen’s Gate, UFO tower, Bratislava castle
Our Third Destination — Vienna
We travelled from Bratislava to Vienna by bus. Again, we booked the bus tickets just the day before we left for Vienna. We did this online and took the Slovak Lines bus to Vienna Bus station. Remember, there are two stops in Vienna. The bus first stops at the airport and then at the central station. Make sure you book your tickets to the central station, not the airport. We were in Vienna for only a day and took the day pass at a metro station near the bus station where we were dropped off. The return buses back to Bratislava also leave from the same station.
Places we visited in Vienna –
1. Stephensplatz and St. Stephen’s Cathedral
Our Vienna tradition is to have Gelato in Stephensplatz and so, that’s what we did. We went to a place — Zanoni and Zanoni — that had Vegan gelato and also vegan Pizza. They also had egg-free chocolate croissants. We finished a quick lunch here and spent the rest of the day looking around Vienna.
2. Hofburg Palace
3. Maria Theresa Square
4. Christmas Markets
5. Belvedere Palace
We left Bratislava on the 19th and reached Budapest. On the last day in Budapest, we simply walked around Kalvin Square, did some shopping, and called it a day. On the morning of the 20th, we boarded the flight back to Bangalore.
Travel within Europe
Within the cities, we never used a Taxi. The airports are very well connected to the city centre by public transport (Metro, Bus and Tram). If you can walk, you won’t need a cab/taxi during any part of your journey. The cities are well connected by public transport.
For kids under 6, public transport was FREE in all three cities!
About Europe in General
Please be aware of your surroundings and do not fall for tourist scams. So far, the central and eastern European countries we’ve visited (Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia, Croatia) are not particularly known for scams. However, scams are more common in places like Italy, France, and Belgium — especially in capital cities and other popular tourist spots. There are several blogs online that discuss the various scams you may encounter, so please read up and stay informed before you travel. Scammers often try to distract you with something (such as asking you to sign a petition or attempting to give you a “free” gift), and while you’re distracted, another member of their group may pickpocket you or steal your bags.
Once in Paris, near Montmartre, we were approached by a girl who asked us to sign a petition for something. This is one of their most common scams. Our advice: just walk away and keep a tight grip on your bags. Also, don’t keep your phone or wallet in your pant pockets. Aravind was almost pickpocketed once but caught the girl in the act, and she quickly ran away. Luckily, he didn’t lose his wallet. The first incident happened in Paris, and the second in Rome. A third incident happened in Athens, where a lady approached me and offered me a free rose. Thankfully, I said no and left. It was only later that I realized this is another popular scam where people offer you free gifts, and once you accept them, they’ll ask for something in return. We encountered no such scams in the three cities we visited this time.
As for food, many vegan eateries can be found in the popular cities if you want to try local cuisine. In Budapest, I suggest you try Napfenyes Etterem — a vegan restaurant that serves local Hungarian cuisine. Make sure you try the Goulash soup! There are also plenty of Indian restaurants if you’re craving Indian food. We always look for Govinda’s — ISKCON’s restaurant. They have branches in several cities and if a city we’re travelling to has one, that’s where we frequent because our son prefers Indian food to local cuisine.
Overall, Europe is always a fantastic travel destination (if you manage to overcome the initial visa hurdle) because once you enter Europe, you have free reign to go anywhere, and everything is so well connected. Also, almost every shop closes by 6 pm. So make sure to do your shopping before then!
Happy travels!

Budapest was my last trip abroad before Covid hit and I’ve been missing these trips terribly. I’ve been traveling inside my own country for the past two years and I’m happy I’m privileged enough to do it despite this whole Covid mess, but I feel something is missing, so maybe writing and sharing will alleviate the itch.
Budapest was on my bucket list since I started a bucket list of places to visit and oh my… I only regret not staying for longer! Budapest is such a beautiful city with so many amazing places to visit and views that you could spend hours just admiring, specially at night when everything is illuminated.
Here goes my itinerary, information about the places I visited, the places I recommend for eating and the useful tips I wish someone had gave me.
I stayed at the Hotel Memories OldTown and I totally recommended it. The location is great, there are bus and tram stops just around the corner, and one of the main bus stops that connects to the airport is located 2min from the hotel (Kálvin tér M). Even though the hotel is located near a very busy street, most rooms face a totally quiet one, so no trouble sleeping. Breakfast was great, with options for all tastes, all fresh and some homemade. Room was big, super comfortable bed and all the typical amenities. There’s a spa center at the hotel with sauna, jacuzzi…

“Almost dead yesterday, maybe dead tomorrow, but alive, gloriously alive, today.” — Robert Jordan, Lord of Chaos
I stepped off the busy burnt-yellow streetcar into a crisp grey late November evening. The bustle so prevalent throughout the centre of Budapest had ebbed away by the time I arrived at my stop. Now it just seemed like a sleepy Sunday afternoon in a small town. We were in Jozsefvaros, or the 8th district of the city, where we had arranged for an overnight staycation in a spa hotel.
We walked towards the hotel as my wife, who had grown up in Budapest, excitedly pointed out the high school she went to almost two decades before, which stood on a square just across from the hotel. It was beautiful in its old-world charm, as was the hotel which had recently been renovated but which originally served as a telecommunications office in the early twentieth century.
As we settled down in our room, I came across a coffee table book bearing black and…

Updated March 2024
Books to read:
Quick geography lesson:
Buda: on the hilly, leafy west side of the Danube river. The foothills have some apartment buildings… further up it’s full of glam villas. Traditionally more Catholic/royalist.
Pest: the flat, east side of the Danube. Full of apartment buildings, gritty side streets and broad avenues. Traditionally more Jewish, cosmopolitan and socialist.
Food and drink (mostly Pest):
Transport:
Trams are an ideal way to see the city, particularly #2 along the Pest side of the river and #6, which circles the ring road. DO buy a ticket, and, as in all tourist-engorged cities, do watch your wallet.
BOLT is a great app for affordable taxis. You can input start/end points and avoid trying to speak Hungarian. Works elsewhere in Central Europe too.
Buda/Pest highlights:
The “Castle District” on the west side of the Danube (Buda) is full of faux medieval architecture, monarchist pretense… skip it if your time is short. If you want to experience a fun conglomeration of scenes, start at the Bambi coffee shop (straight out of 1962), walk up the hill to Szell Kalman Ter (used to be Moszkva Ter, the tram hub where kids gathered during the 70s and 80s to plot their night escapades) to see the Mammut Mall (modern, erected on the site of an old train factory), the Fenyi Utcai Piac (farmer’s market in a modern/brutalist setting) and have a coffee at a cafe along the pedestrian Lovohaz utca and eat at Pingrumba (mentioned above.) From here, you can grab a #6 tram to head over to Pest…
Random stuff on the east (Pest) side is better. A quick tour below… if you start at roughly 12 o’clock on the clock dial, this zigzags around to 6 o’clock. Most of this stuff — with the exception of the city market — is within 5–10 minutes walk of other points.
Budapest, the melting pot:
Pronunciation:
After returning from Hungary, should you talk about your visit to “Budapesht” (mimicking Hungarian, which turns “s” into “sh”) or “Budapest” (phonetically in English)? Many tourists affect the former pronunciation — which is odd, because almost nobody talks about their trips to “Paree” or “Roma,” right? (I confront the same problem when referring to Indianapolis, which residents universally call “Indy,” when I’m outside in Indiana.)

And a friend’s notes on Prague. Notes on Budapest’s rising prices for tourists. Online resources: LikeLocals.

It’s been a few days since we left the city of Budapest but since we’re still on the road roaming through Transylvania, writing articles takes me longer than usual. And so does editing videos.
We’ve taken lots of footage on this trip so far and I decided to break up the clips. Here’s the video now of our first part of the journey.
And in case you didn’t read the articles about our stay in the city you can do it now.

Budapest is only one hour flight from Frankfurt. I have heard so many great reviews of the city that I decided it was time to visit the capital of Hungary.
Jacob had a birthday on the 10th of October and I decided to surprise him by flying with him to Budapest for three days. Turned out, it was a fantastic present for both of us.
In the BUD airport, I withdrew local forints from an ATM, bought my 3-day Budapest public transportation ticket, and off we went to the city center by bus.
It turned out the only time I needed cash was when I used city toilets. All the restaurants, cafes, museums, and parking garages accept credit cards.
On the second thought, we found another use for unspent forints. More about it in the next story about the city.😉
Our apartment was located in a beautiful and grandiose building erected at the beginning of the 20th century, at the time when modern Hungary was a part of the powerful Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.
The apartment was located in a mostly flat Pest part of the capital, just 10 minutes walking distance away from the Hungarian Parliament building. From there, we could enjoy fantastic views of the hilly Buda and Obuda parts of the city, located across the Danube River.

It’s the first of October and I’m in one of the most beautiful cities in all of Europe. I walked nearly 20 miles today through 2,000 years of history: through the overthrow of kingdoms and empires, the fall of communism, the rise of capitalism, the evidence of centuries-old glitz, and the stories of human survival and defeat… and through it all, Budapest (pronounced Boo-da-pesht) has held its head high.
The bus ride from the airport last night took me past lights illuminating modern outlet malls. Giant billboards stood above a newly paved highway for Pizza Hut, NewYorker clothing, a Mercedes dealer, mattress stores and diamond merchants. Was this right? Had I just landed in Hungary? I was expecting sturdy grandmothers, about as wide as they were high, slinging potato sacks into communist-built trucks, clothed in brown, and selling unevenly carved salt blocks on the side of a dirt road. But this looked like I was riding past a strip mall in middle America.
We left the outskirts and were soon in the city proper: Baroque, Gothic, Classical and Art Nouveau architecture… it was like Prague, only the streets were wider and the buildings a touch more opulent. We pulled into downtown, and what I’d later learn to be the Pes(shh)t side of the city where a giant white Ferris wheel, a replica of the London Eye, stood next to the Danube River and a purple-lit Chain Bridge.
I exited the bus and walked down a narrow cement canyon made up of 5-story high buildings. Drunk college kids staggered and laughed in packs, weaving their way down the sidewalk. It was a Monday, but may as well have been a Saturday night- it was like walking through the East Village in Manhattan. Graffiti was scribbled on old decaying buildings, giving it that mysterious post-communist look. Dark alleyways and shuttered store fronts looked like part of an intended stage set. Kids covered in tattoos smoked cigarettes in doorways and wandered into crumbling ‘Ruin’ bars (pop-up bars with antique furniture and communist paraphernalia in abandoned buildings) before hitting the late-night pizza parlors, pianos bars, or even taco stands. I’d later learn I was just a few blocks from the big tourist draw of Saint Stephen’s Cathedral, down from the Four Seasons, the Ritz, and the Parliament. Luxury was mixed with disintegrating alleyways; it was all part of the city’s pallet.
I found my Air BnB, after having walked past it twice, tucked away between a furniture store and a construction site, located on one of the uprooted side streets in the Jewish Quarter. The cement walls on the exterior and in the open courtyard were crumbling, a patchwork of grey filler smeared the walls in no particular pattern. Chicken wire caged the mineshaft-like elevator, which was surrounded by a spiral staircase. There was a central area between the buildings that opened to the sky where trash was kept and laundry hung from railings. Red ivy cascaded alongside large cracks that ran the building like deep scars: another perfect backdrop for an East Berlin spy movie and no wonder it was $35 a night.
The inside of the apartment, though, could have been a museum: 2 old-fashioned typewriters, an antique sewing machine, gilded mirrors, fedoras hanging from walls, and half a canoe posing as a bookshelf. The place was big, maybe 800sq ft, with 12’ ceilings. During the day, light would pour in from double-paned windows and every once in awhile there would be a burst of pigeons, like fireworks over the rooftops, visible through the windows. In the living room, old wooden oars hung curtains and in the bathroom, antique golf clubs hung towels.
I looked down at my phone to see how many miles I had clocked walking through the city that day: 19.3. No wonder I was exhausted. Making my way into the apartment, I searched for anything edible in the old-fashioned kitchen. A bar of chocolate and an apple were propped up against an Italian espresso Moka Pot. Caffeine, an apple, and more caffeine? It looked like it was time to track down some authentic Hungarian cousine… would pizza count?
The night before I had ridden the massive white ferris wheel to get a view of the city from above, then photographed the beautifully lit Chain Bridge. I grabbed pizza (it rivaled New York City’s) and ice cream and sat watching the crowds flow in and out of the square in front of Saint Stephen’s Cathedral.
I read somewhere that this city can be substituted in films for Moscow, Paris, Berlin, Rome, and even Buenos Aires. 4 historical periods are visible in the architecture, including 1st Century Roman ruins next to Buda Castle and medieval buildings at one of the bath houses. The city just feels familiar- like I’ve been here before and have been waiting unknowingly to come back.
In the morning, I went for a run over to the Buda side where the Buda Castle is. The lush rolling hills of Buda (previously a separate city from Pest) includes gorgeous lookouts of the city from Fisherman’s Bastion: neo-Romanesque architecture with a view of the Parliament across the Danube. I did a 3hr historical (free) walking tour later and learned that Hungarians prefer the term Central Europe, not Eastern Europe; that post-communism is a mixture between democracy and communism; that the Turks brought the bath houses, coffee houses, and even paprika here over 500 years ago; that the Austro-Hungarian empire (post 1867) had a shared capital between Vienna and Budapest. (Each city tried to outdo the other in architecture and panache resulting in a building boom that made most of the city’s grandiose buildings of today.) And interestingly, 70% of Europe’s gold is from Hungary, which may explain the demand for the region and its prosperity.
I wandered back and forth over the 3 bridges, visiting the Parliament and an art instillation from 2005 called Shoes on the Danube River (a memorial of shoes left behind by Jews during WWII who were shot into the Danube. The shoes had been worth more than the people and they’d been instructed to remove them ahead of time). Learning about historical tragedies like these (over 600,000 Jews were killed in Hungary during WWII) and the rise and fall of the many kingdoms, empires, and modern governments had me in a trance, the crunch of pebbles under my feet, the feel of the leather shoes against my fingers. I stared across the river to the Buda side with its rolling hills and castles, the crisp fall air wrapping around me like a hug from an old friend.
As the sun dipped below the horizon, I made my way to the 1888 Baroque-style Turkish Baths at Széchenyiin City Park, my towel and swimsuit stuffed in my backpack. For the equivalent of $7, I had the use of all the mineral pools of varying temperatures from ice cold plunges to naturally hot pools, saunas and steam rooms. Faucets on ancient pipes in the sauna could be turned on to refill your water bottle, which reminded me of the fire hydrants around the city that also have a device allowing people to refill with delicious tap water. Water was flowing from everywhere, I had never seen anything quite like it.
When I got here 2 nights ago, I had known almost nothing about Budapest. I came because of a $49 airfare from Paris and a spare two days. Getting off that plane and riding into a worn yet opulent city that faces a fairy tale of castles and palaces across a winding river had me more fascinated than I expected; I knew immediately that 2 days wouldn’t be enough.
One thing I’m embarrassed about is that I didn’t experience Hungarian food. The immigrant cultures of Turkish and Italian were so prominent, with gyro shops and pizza restaurants everywhere, there wasn’t much of a draw to heavy Hungarian food. Still, I did learn the importance of Paprika (a mild pepper powder) in every dish- like in goulash (pronounced gulyas) and paprikash. Onions, garlic, potatoes, paprika and bacon make the basis for most Hungarian dishes, which run close to 3,000 calories per serving.
Another interesting tidbit is that the 500-year-old coffee culture, brought in by the Ottoman Empire, had created more than 400 cafes by the 19th Century. Intellectuals and writers would gather, chain smoking and waxing poetic in their caffeinated excitement. The culture was squashed by the communists after WWII, but it’s made a comeback since their independence in 1989. Coffee ‘take away’ and drip coffee isn’t very popular, so chains like Starbucks and McCafe have adjusted by serving espresso in china teacups.
As I rode the bus back out to the airport, a day and a half after my arrival, the scene looked more familiar in the light and more reasonable than my initial assessment. Of course there would be malls outside of this bustling city with English billboards- Hungarian is one of the top 5 most difficult languages in the world after all. With communism over, this country had sprung at the opportunity to connect with the capitalist west- and they play the part well.
Budapest, known as the Paris of the east, should be on everyone’s bucket list; I know I can’t wait to return.

Probably due to the fact I part time live in Hungary, I am often asked about Budapest. So here are my takes and suggestions!
Budapest is a big city with several district articles containing sightseeing, restaurant, nightlife and accommodation listings.Budapest (Hungarian pronunciation approximates to “boo-dah-pesht”) is the capital city of Hungary. With a unique, youthful atmosphere, a world-class classical music scene as well as a pulsating night life increasingly appreciated among European youth and, last but not least, an exceptionally rich offering of natural thermal baths, Budapest is one of Europe’s most delightful and enjoyable cities. Due to its scenic setting and its architecture it is nicknamed “Paris of the East”.
In 1987 Budapest was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List for the cultural and architectural significance of the Banks of the Danube, the Buda Castle Quarter and Andrássy Avenue.
I am obsessed by the Fisherman Bastion …in a photographic sort of way. The proximity with one of my favourite patisserie does the rest!
I know they are new, I know they do not mean or serve much I still love them!
Located in the historic district of Castle Hill, the Fisherman’s Bastion (or Halászbástya) is a neo-Gothic terrace that looks like a structure taken straight out of a fairytale. Designed and built between 1895 and 1902, next door — Fisherman’s Bastion is named after the medieval guild of fishermen who protected Budapest from invasion.
The gleaming white structure provides panoramic views of the city: From here, you can snap some breathtaking pictures of the Danube, Margaret Island and Pest. You may choose to take some time to explore the bastion’s seven ornate turrets, which symbolize the tents of the seven Magyar tribe leaders who settled the Carpathian Basin, ultimately leading to the existence of modern-day Hungary.
Andrassy Utca is one of the most beautiful avenues in Budapest. The big green trees and the high end fashion stores give it an elegant vibe. Very nice to walk along it.It is a lovely wide avenue for a stroll. There are lots of restaurants and international clothing chains, high end on the street. The Opera is here and on the day I was walking they were making a period movie. It was nice to watch. Several places for coffee and of course, the clothing chain COS is here. If you walk to the end you will pass the Terror House and wind up at the big city park with the zoo.
A soak in a thermal bath is a quintessential Budapest experience (it hasn’t cultivated a reputation as the “City of Spas” for nothing). These baths, or fürdok in Hungarian, are heated by natural thermal springs and usually include on-site massage services, as well as steam rooms. There is no other bath as the Széchenyi Baths!!! The Geller are pretty do not get me wrong but you can find similar or better anywere in the world!
SZÉCHENYI BATHS
One of the last remnants of the Turkish influence in Hungary, a visit to the thermal baths is a quintessential Budapest experience. I haven’t visited all of the baths in Budapest, but I have been to several of the most famous Budapest baths and the grandiose Széchenyi Baths are by far my favourite. Early morning or just before sunset is my favourite times for a soak in the thermal, healing waters of Széchenyi’s outdoor pools.
…and discover why Budapest is called the Pearl of the Danube!
Ah, the Chain Bridge — one of my very favourite bridges in the world. It was the first bridge to permanently connect Buda and Pest and was completed in 1849. At the time, the Chain Bridge was considered to be one of the wonders of the world and the architect was so immensely proud of his work that he challenged anyone to find fault with the bridge. It is said that when it was discovered that the lions that stand guard at either end are missing their tongues, the architect committed suicide.
The Great Market Hall in central Budapest is Budapest’s most famous marketplace.
Whilst many locals still use the market hall as a place to buy their groceries, the market is incredibly popular with the tourists too.
Locally grown fruits and veg, and locally sourced meats are found on the lower floors, and souvenirs including lace, chess sets and leather goods are available in the upper floors.
As well as individual ingredients, it is possible to pick up homemade local delicacies like goulash and langos from the food stall upstairs.
Budapest is full of cafes to have a delicious cuppa joe and try one of the sweets Budapest is famous for. Cafe Ruszwurm, on the Castle Hill, is one of Budapest’s oldest traditional confectioners still operating as a cafe.
it is very cosy and small, has just about a dozen seats, There is a wide selection of the day’s fresh pastries, truffles, and coffee concoctions to choose from. The decor is charming too with antique furniture and tools of the old confectionery trade in the glass curio cabinets.
Cafe Ruszwurm is located at Szentháromság u. 7 and is open 9am — 8pm Spring through Fall and 10am — 7pm in Winter.
Completed in 1904, the Hungarian Parliament Building is one of Budapest’s most famous landmarks. The National Assembly of Hungary still meets there to this day. Travelers come mainly to take in the building’s architecture (primarily Gothic Revival style), beautiful statues and paintings, and national significance. According to many, there is no structure in Hungary that serves as a better symbol of the country’s independence and commitment to democracy.
Heroes’ Square (or Hosök tere) is one of Budapest’s grandest landmarks as well as the largest public square in the city. Swing by this area to take a picture of the Millenium Monument which was erected in 1896 to celebrate Hungary’s 1000th anniversary.
The square and the monument are dedicated to “the memory of those heroes who gave their lives for the freedom of our people and our national independence.” At the base of the famous column (topped with the archangel Gabriel) are statues representing seven Magyar chieftains — considered to be the founders of the Hungarian nation. Behind the column are matching colonnades with 14 statues of royalty and other important figures in Hungarian history.
This funicular, which first opened in 1870, is the second oldest funicular of its kind in the world. A system of weights and counterweights is used to help to raise the carriages up and down the hill. The funicular is the fastest way to get to the top of Castle Hill, and is exceedingly popular because of its panoramic views out across the Danube. (You can also get there with this Segway tour)
The speed of ascent was actually slowed down as of 1988, to give passengers more time to enjoy their ride. The track is open daily until 10pm, so it is also a great way to enjoy views of Pest at night.
This stretch of the Danube walkway goes from the Elizabeth Bridge to the Chain Bridge, and is perfect for those who want a short, but interesting walk. Promenading along the Danube is a great way to see many of the most famous sights in the capital.
Looking over towards to Buda side of the river, you will see the Buda Castle, the Liberty Statue on Gellert Hill and the Fisherman’s Bastion. On the Promenade side of the river, you can enjoy restaurants, cafes, Szechenyi Istvan Square and a range of different sculptures, including the Little Princess
Located on Vörösmarty Square and dating back to 1858, Gerbeaud is one of Budapest’s most famous spots to get delicious desserts. Unlike at the other spots, here I have three recommendations. Firstly, the Dobos Torte as they bake it is the very best…secondly because it’s Emil Gerbeaud that gave the world the Gerbeaud slice (also written as ‘Zserbó szelet’), we suggest the rethought/reworked version of this Hungarian favourite: the Gerbeaud Sundae. While it’s quite pricey (2550 HUF + service fee), it’s a huge dessert that’s practically a meal. Two scoops of walnut sponge, one scoop of chocolate ice-cream, two scoops of walnut ice-cream, chocolate sauce, apricot sauce, crispy walnut linzer, whipped cream and apricot foam, topped with a small Gerbeaud slice. It’s super sweet, yet the perfect mix of old and new, cake and cream, warm and cold. Secondly, we recommend the classic cake served with vanilla ice-cream and the legendary ‘cat’s tongue.’
Sissy, wife of Emperor Franz Joseph and Queen of Hungary always dropped in the Gerbeaud cafe when she was in Budapest.
MY SUPER FAVOURITE REMAINS THE DOBOS TORTE!!!
I like very much the idea and feeling of sipping a cafe while surrounded by books and magazines.
The building shows some wonderful neo-renaissance characteristics, especially when we’re drinking a hot black coffee in the room decorated with Lotz Károly’s murals. Used to be my favourite with a superb coffee place, sadly the coffee has closed, Bookshop is great
39 Andrássy út ·Website
Once the residence of Manó Mai (1855–1917), photographer ro the imperial court, this 120-year- old listed building houses an exhibition hall, the Sunlight Atelier, bookshop and library.

I strongly believe in Budapest like in most of Mittel/Eastern Europe you can eat well and genuinely with 4/7 Euro. The places below reflect this feeling and are my favourites. You can have a meal with 900–1600 HUF
Our favourite restaurant during the stays in Budapest. The portions are huge at a decent price (and you can always ask for a smaller portion for 70% of the price!). The lovely home-made lemonade is a mix of lemon, orange and basil which is super refreshing and you can order a half a litre of it. Their goulash is superb as well as the
The service is always really nice too, answering all the questions we had about the dishes. Family and friendly staff. This is where you can find us in the evening when we are in the Capital!
Budapest, Hold u. 11, 1054 Hungary
This place is a cheap place to eat traditional, and not only. It;s a buffet type, and not a traditional restaurant, and I think it’s a bit underrated, compared to the very overrated and expensive “City Market” restaurant choices — this place is just around the corner from the City Market, and has the same nice dishes, for less money — and you always have a place to sit and eat, unlike the market. We live very close when in Budapest so it is our fav lunch place
Lonyay utca 7, Budapest 1093, Hungary
A new find, next to the beer owned Kaltenberg Restaurant. It is very nice and modern, Staff is attentive and the food is good!

A simple, inexpensive cash-only eatery with only 5–6 tables (prepare to share the table with other guests). If you want to try hearty Hungarian food this the place to go. Menu in English is available.
Daily menu (soup + main dish or főzelék + meat or sausage) from around HUF 800 -1 200. Try mushroom paprikash with galuska, or máglyarakás (a typical local sweet treat: layers of sliced crescents, apples, apricot jam, with meringue on top and baked in oven.

A lot of Hungarian soldiers and civilians died during World War I and their loved ones went numb. Their fathers, brothers, husbands and sons were somewhere away from home, either mixed in soil or were feeding themselves to birds. Until then Budapest was more attractive than a magnet to tourists from every part of the world. The post-war effects and an approach of the new war engulfed Budapest.
Budapest was now in the arms of mass suicides, which arose from the day of losing their loved ones. Budapest became “The city of Suicides”. Will you believe me if I say all these happened because of a popular song “Gloomy Sunday”, which was printed in Sunday Times? It was also called ‘the suicide song’ and ‘the killer song’. It was written in a hundred languages around the world and has claimed to have killed hundreds of people.
All the people who drowned in the deep waters of Danube River had left behind the newspaper cutting of Sunday Times, which had the lyrics of the song. It was composed by Rezső Seress and published in 1933. Here are the lines.
“Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?
Gloomy Sunday
Death is no dream,
For in death I’m caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I’ll be blessing you
Gloomy Sunday”
The song somehow gave hope to all the people who wanted to reunite with their loved ones.
In 1937, ‘The Sunday Times’ wrote an article on the “ City of Suicides”. It’s funny how the newspaper criticises and asks to ban the song and the lyricist for suicides. When it was The Sunday Times, who propagated and shared those lines throughout Budapest in the first place. The song was then banned on radios.
The politicians, social activists, common people were searching for a solution. To bring out people from their sad lives. And now professor Jeno and hypnotist Binczo brought out the“Smile School”. This was to counteract the unending love for suicides.
People of Budapest had already forgotten how to smile. Not even a four-year-old smiled. The Smile School was introducing them to a different world. At first people were made to wear a smiling mask. Teaching them, how to smile by hiding their feelings inside. They thought that teaching the people how to smile would make them happier. And finally forget the pain!
Then they started teaching different styles of smile, the Roosevelt smile, the Mona Lisa smile, the Dick Powell smile, the Loretta smile, and a lot more. They could choose the smile of any celebrity they loved and the fees was depending on the type of smile they want to master. They claimed to charge up to $500 for teaching the Roosevelt smile in six weeks. Roosevelt had the best smile!
The Mona Lisa smile is more difficult but cheaper. They were asked to do the smiles they were learning five times a day, using a mirror. Founder of Smile School, hypnotist Jeno said says the best business is enabling pupils to achieve the talent of smiling naturally.
Thousands of people around Budapest joined the Smile Schools desperately to learn how to smile! All around the world, where Budapest was once called the “ City of Suicides” a new name came up, “The City of Smiles.” However there was no reduction in suicides, the change was only in the name!
There were still people dying around with the song “ Gloomy Sunday” near the banks of Danube.
By then the whole Smile School was proved to be a hoax by Het Leven.
BUDAPEST, “CITY OF SUICIDES,” IS TAUGHT TO FORCE A SMILE
A joker in Budapest, Hungary lately evolved the “smile school” The idea was made in purpose to counteract the bad publicity Budapest has gotten from the number of suicides supposedly inspired by the Budapest song, Gloomy Sunday. The suicide rate in Budapest is actually very high, even now.
The Smile School was then shut down, with the beginning of World War II. But this simple odd idea of teaching people smile led to the evolution of Laughter brigades and Laughter clubs around the world!
Love,
Dona

We arrived in Budapest yesterday afternoon. It took quite a bit to get here from Wisconsin but that’s for another post. Our travels went as planned and we stepped on to the Viking Longship we were traveling on around 2 o’clock in the afternoon.
After drinks, dinner, and partially unpacking in our stateroom, I dragged my husband across town to walk over the famous Chain Bridge at night to get a much-wanted, even required, photograph of the Budapest Parliament Building.
It and other buildings in Budapest are beautifully illuminated at night, as are the bridges that span the Danube River in that part of Hungary.
Walking from our boat, between the Liberty Bridge and the Elizabeth Bridge, to the Parliament Building was at least a couple of miles. After traveling on a plane for most of the last day, walking was a welcome relief.
My husband and I are big walkers on vacation. We enjoy it.
Before we got to the Chain Bridge, we had beautiful views of Buda Castle high on the Budapest side of the Danube. Again, gorgeous!

I wouldn’t classify myself as spontaneous. I always like to evaluate and ponder big decisions or dilemmas before taking any action. That being said I am becoming more aware of the privilege that being in my early 20s affords me. I am not settled in a specific place, have no real commitments apart from my work and no one yet depends on me to live their life. I find stating this particularly freeing, it is good to be able to make last-minute plans with friends and this is a luxury that is only typically afforded at the start and end of your life. However, this is not something I usually take advantage of and most recently I have been wanting to utilize it as I know I will miss it as life progresses.
In the company I work at, we have an internal shop slack channel where people can buy or sell goods. Last month, my friend spotted last-minute plane tickets being sold a week in advance for a weekend getaway to Budapest and naturally he suggested that we go. I was originally unsure about this, I wanted to spend this weekend achieving some tasks before climbing in Portland. But naturally, something in my mind told me to use this privilege in my life and go on the trip. So somewhat apprehensively I agreed! This blog is going to go over our adventure in Budapest!
Day 1
Our departing flight left at 8 am, so this meant a 5 am starting journey to Luton airport (thanks Ben for driving us). I typically don’t like taking early morning flights but I really enjoyed the experience of waking up early and being in another country by lunchtime.
Our flight landed just after lunch, and after getting through the terrible queues for passport control (thank you Brexit!) we got a bus and metro into town and picked out a great brunch spot for lunch called cookie beacon. This was a great restaurant to eat, it catered for Ben’s burger craving and my gluten allergy. They also had keto cookies, which were really good and filling. During this time we outlined what we wanted to achieve on this trip, where we wanted to go and the experiences we wanted to have.
We first headed into central Budapest (on the Pest side of the river) to check out a thermal bath. We decided that as it was a Friday, this was the best time to try and go to avoid it being overcrowded. We chose the Széchenyi Thermal Bath, while it is more expensive than some of the other baths it looked much better and was located in a lovely area near the central park. I would definitely recommend checking out a bath while in Budapest, while it is not on the level of the Blue Lagoon in Iceland they don’t have the eggy smell that sulphur baths have and unlike a swimming pool, they get very warm.
One word of advice is to make sure you bring your own flip-flops to these baths, most require you to wear them and the prices they charge for them are extortionate!
After spending the afternoon in the bath, we took a walk back to the Airbnb we picked out and cooked up some dinner, excited to make the most of our time in the country.
Day 2
As this was our only full day in Budapest we wanted to make the most of it. We decided to take an early morning walking tour of Budapest. These are pretty common in Europe, they are free to sign up for and the tour guide will expect tips at the end. I always enjoy taking these types of tours when a visit a new city, they are a great way to see as much of the city as you can and they provide much-needed context to any attractions.
We had a great tour guide (thanks Regina!), and some highlights for me included the St. Stephen’s Basilica church, the USSR and Nazi monuments and the Hungarian Parliament building. Regina was incredibly knowledgeable about all the sites we stopped off at and gave some great recommendations for clubs and bars in Budapest to visit.
One interesting moment for me during the tour was the Nazi monument. This monument was created in memory of the Nazi invasion and subsequent occupation of Hungary. As Regina explained to us, this statue has potential implications that Hungary is absolved from collaboration with the Nazi government and the actions that they took. As a result, this is a controversial attraction for some, especially Jewish Hungarians.
After taking the tour we grabbed some lunch and then walked across the river to Buda to visit the castle, stopping to take some scenic pictures of the Hungarian parliament building from the river.
To end our day we decided to double down on our spontaneity and go to a bar and club. We received a great piece of advice from Regina to visit the Szimpla Kert ruin bar, these ruin bars are built from bombed buildings in WW2. Instead of being rebuilt, they were minimally converted into bars and make for a really nice setting as they have a lot of natural light and character to them.
We ended our day with a night out at the Instant-Fogas Complex club. Clubbing is not something that I do often as in the past I have not had enjoyable experiences, but in the spirit of this holiday, I thought I would give it another go. Surprisingly we had a great time, even catching the closing stages of a Hungarian rock concert before the dancefloor started getting busy.
Day 3
After enjoying ourselves the night before we decided to have a lazy morning. We grabbed coffee at Anna’s cafe in the centre near the river and then relaxed in Elizabeth Square. At lunchtime, we headed back to the airport to catch our flight home.
Conclusions
Overall this was a really special trip for me. It took me outside of my comfort zone for the first time in a while and also took me away from my regular schedule. It felt really good to be spontaneous and I loved the trip. Budapest is a wonderful city full of beauty, character and history. Is it hard to comprehend coming from Britain that within the space of 70 or so years, Hungary has known 3 different types of political systems. It opens your mind and after all, that is the beauty of travelling, to take yourself out of your bubble and experience another country’s culture and educate yourself on their history.
Usually, I am very keen on planning out a schedule when going abroad, but during this trip I allowed myself to relax and let the plans get made as and when we chose to. There was something very freeing and relaxing about this. This was only possible as I had such good friends with me, I could trust that I could be honest with them and we had each other best interests at heart.
Overall this trip has been an amazing experience and I can’t wait to go on another weekend trip, spontaneous or not!

It was early on Thursday morning.
Neither my dad nor I got a good night’s sleep.
My father ate something which evidently didn’t agree with him.
While I was jittery with a mixture of anxiety and excitement.
Excited because I was about to visit a part of the world I’d never been to before:
Eastern Europe.
Prior to this experience, I’d never stepped foot in Eastern Europe before.
Sure, technically speaking, Istanbul is in Eastern Europe.
And I’d also been to Greece as a kid.
But this was different.
For the first time in my life, I’d be venturing deep into the land of the iron curtain.
I’d heard so much about this part of the world, and in modern times it’s been described as a European paradise.
All the benefits of capitalism while maintaining its traditional roots.
Something I wish I could say the same about Britain.
So yes, I was excited.
But I was also anxious.
Not about the journey, but about something else.
Namely my love life.
But I’ll save that for day 3.
Stick around and keep reading this series if you’d like to know what happens.
Either way, I barely got any sleep before our flight and was absolutely knackered.
I woke up around 8 and got ready for the taxi’s arrival at 9.
Everything was going according to plan.
We left the house at 9AM and zoomed off to the airport.
Despite the airport being miles away, we got there in just 45 minutes.
0 traffic = 0 problems.
The airport too was a walk in the park.
We checked our bags in with zero problems and got through security without a single hiccup.
I was a little nervous about the sheet of paper I’d been given by the immigration beaurea.
It didn’t look super legit and I wasn’t sure if I’d be turned away at passport control.
Thankfully, I didn’t and everything was cool.
We find our gate and chill out in the seats.
After a few minutes of listening to music and playing chess, we were ready to board the plane.
We queue up and see something strange…
Some people are being escorted out of the line and are being told some awful news.
Me and my dad looked at each other, puzzled.
What could possibly be going on?
Turns out, some people weren’t given any seats to board the plane!
It seems Budapest is quite a popular destination.
Thank goodness we had the foresight to check-in online prior to arriving at the airport, otherwise it would have been us who’d be escorted out of the line.
With a sigh of relief and a few empathetic looks, we were on the plane and seated.
The flight flew by in a flash as I slept through all of it.
2 hours later, we were in Budapest and ready to start our Eastern European adventure.
I’d done some research and was clued up on what to do once arriving at the airport.
We did all the formal stuff like going through passport control and picking up our bags.
Next came the fun part:
Finding our way into the city.
Me and my dad each bought a 15 day transport pass which allowed us unlimited access on every transportation in the city for… you guessed it, 15 days.
I had a look online and people were saying there was a week pass, but they’ve clearly changed it.
Either way, we grabbed one of those (called a 15-Day Budapest Pass) and made our way to the bus stop.
The plan was to get the 100E bus which would take us straight into the city centre.
We would have done this if it weren’t for the fact that our Budapest pass isn’t valid for that particular bus (typical).
I asked one of the conductors what to do and he told us we could get the 200E bus that would take us to where we needed to go.
Sweet!
I picked up a map and started doing some high IQ geographical calculations in my head.
I love this about going to a new place.
There’s a certain thrill about figuring out how to find your way around.
I do this everywhere I go.
When I first lived in Istanbul, I would always be hopping on different buses/tubes and exploring.
When I moved to London, I’d spend months venturing into the city centre and finding my way round.
Budapest was no exception.
We got on the 200E bus and ended up at the closest Metro station (Kőbánya-Kispest).
This was our first taste of Hungary, and I’m not gonna lie, it was weird.
A lot of the advertising was similar to the stuff you’d see in rural Turkey, except with a European twist.
Instead of a woman in a headscarf advertising a homemade pide restaurant, we had juiced up Europeans advertising a local supplement company.
The buildings were a mix of modern monstrosities and Soviet era crumblings.
It wasn’t until we entered the city of Budapest that I was faced with the sheer beauty of humanity’s potential.
There was also a moment where a homeless guy walked onto the bus and stunk the place up.
It brought me back to a sunny Spring day in Sheffield where a man who hadn’t showered in months had everyone gasping for fresh air with his stench.
Not exactly the warmest welcome…
From Kőbánya-Kispest we took the blue M3 Metro line to Ferenciek Tere.
If you’re curious, this is right into the centre of Pest and just a minutes walk from the Danube.
In hindsight, we didn’t need to go to this station as Deak Ferenc Ter (the stop before it) would have helped us get to our desired destination a lot faster.
Even so, we learnt this later on after some research.
From Ferenciek Tere we walked on the main street up towards Astoria and eventually reached Blaha Lujza Ter (where our hotel and subsequently our AirBNB was).
On our walk, we got our very first look at Budapest.
And honestly?
I was a little underwhelmed.
Lots of homeless people.
A strange smell in the air (mostly urine).
Much fewer Hungarians than I had pictured.
And it was absolutely scorching hot.
No doubt, this was my fault.
I had this idea of Hungary being a European bastion of beauty.
I expected everything to be pristine, clean and perfect.
With those kinds of high standards, I was bound to be met with some dissapointment.
If you’re Hungarian and reading this, don’t be offended.
I love Budapest.
I just want to give you my honest first impressions before fully discovering the true beauty of the city.
After a few minutes of walking, I noticed something concerning.
My dad was limping.
And he wasn’t limping a little, he was limping quite heavily.
He’d mentioned the night before our flight that he had a pain in his foot, and clearly the pain hadn’t subsided.
I asked him if he was alright and he grimaced back, “I’m fine, just get a bloody move on”.
I heard the man and we marched on towards our hotel.
We didn’t have to march long as within a few minutes were outside our hotel in the middle of town.
It was a really weird hotel.
Looked utterly rubbish on the outside, but the inside was as lavish as you could possibly imagine.
It’s called the Atrium Fashion Hotel and it’s located on Csokonai utca, one street behind the Blaha Lujza ter Metro station.
If you want to visit Budapest, I think you’d enjoy your time at this hotel.
Our room was cosy, the hotel staff were extremely helpful and friendly (Hi Adam!) and it’s right in the centre of Pest.
We were only there for one night, but we had a good time.
After getting into our room, we did what any normal people would do:
Have a shower and then a nap.
(Not together obviously, that would be weird lol).
After waking up, it was pretty late.
Like I said, neither of us slept well the night before and needed to recover.
Once we woke up, it was time to go for a wander.
My dad struggled to get into his trainers as his foot was as swollen as Arnold Schwarzenegger’s biceps. But once they were in, we were ready to go.
The first point of call was to find the place where my dad would be attending his business conference.
While he’d be spending most of his days in Budapest there, I’d be free to check out the Hungarian capital solo.
After swerving in and out of meandering side-streets, we were able to find the conference hall with little difficulty.
Weirdly, it was located right in the middle of Pest’s party district.
Surrounding the conference venue were plenty of pubs, bars and nightclubs which were teeming with tourists and locals all day and all night.
Luckily for us, we were also able to find an incredible Hungarian restaurant with a live pianist.
My dad instantly fell in love with the piano player and couldn’t stop applauding his every move.
I honestly think he loved the music more than the food, which is saying something because the food was outstanding.
I had a Goulash soup followed by a Goulash dish.
The result?
Love.
I officially love Hungarian food.
It’s incredible.
While I was busy guzzling down the wonderful meal that was in front of me, my dad was staring starry eyed at the pianist as he played love songs with his elegant fingers.
At one point, my dad got so into it that he began singing at the top of his lungs and began drawing confused looks from everyone in the restaurant.
My cheeks flushed red in embarassment as I pleaded for him to stop, but he wouldn’t listen:
“WEEEE ARE THE CHAMPIONS, MY FRIENDS…..
AND WEEEE’LL, KEEP ON FIIIGHTING TILL THE END…”
Safe to say we both had a great time on our first night in Budapest.
Tomorrow would be even better…
If you liked this little story, stay tuned for the next ones.
I’m going to be sharing everything I did and all the things I was feeling on my travels.
Thanks for reading,
Godfrey

Budapest, like other capital cities, have interesting memorials and statues that turn heads and force conversation. And there are plenty of them too; afterall, the largest statue park in Europe is also here, measuring a huge 56 hectares (Kerepesi Cemetery).
Memento Park is also just outside the city, and born from a difficult past. After the lifting of the Iron Curtain, Hungarians uprooted and dumped almost every statue placed during the communist period. Out of the city; out of the mind. The following are a list of the most interesting statues in Budapest.
Belgrád rkp., 1056
A lovely stroll down the Pest-side of the Danube pedestrian zone will bring you to these two wholesome figures. It’s a spitting distance to the ‘little princess’, and a beautiful place to photograph and take in the views of the Buda side. Look out for The Marriott Hotel.
Actually, not much is known about these statues, except that the Sculptor Raffay Dávid had known he wanted to be a sculptor from an early age — three years old!
Széchenyi Lánchíd, 1051
When I first arrived in Budapest, I was told the Myth about the Lions on the four corners of the Széchenyi Bridge. It goes a little something like this.
In 1852, sculptor János Marschalkó unveiled his stone work to be used on the recently opened Széchenyi Bridge. He was so proud of his work that he announced he would throw himself off the bridge if any faults were found. The story goes on to say that a girl spoke up that the lions had no tongues. He threw himself off the bridge out of embarrassment.
Whether he did or not, it’s a story full of passion, big-headedness, and a pinch of comedy (OK, tragedy). János Marschalkó lived well into the 1870’s, and for good reason — the lions HAVE tongues, they just can’t be seen from a low perspective.
NB — This made me think of The National Library in Sarajevo — Check it out!
Corvin sétány 1, 1082
I’m sure you know Bud Spencer — an actor, famous for adventure comedies, crime escapades and spaghetti westerns. This rootin’, tootin’ and gun-shootin’ Italian, originally from Naples, starred in over 50 films, a handful of TV and even a video game. Although Budapest is well known for filmmaking, Bud Spencer never came to Budapest, neither filmed any scenes here. So why the statue?
Bud Spencer didn’t receive the attention he did until he teamed up with Terence Hill in the late 60’s. Together, they created simple yet action packed films that everyone around the world could enjoy. Hungarians, during the communist occupation, fell in love with the entertainment he brought with each new film. They were the popular stars from a foreign country — an attractive one from outside the communist reach. Although they appeared dubbed, the story lines were easy enough to follow without needing to know the language.
The huge bronze statue weighs in at half a ton, and was placed there a year after his death in 2016 by sculptor Szandra Tasnádi as a beautiful sign of respect. It is the first one of its kind, and at the unveiling was Cristiana Pedersoli (daughter) and Olympic water polo player György Kárpáti (friend). The inscription “We never fought” were the words Terrence Hill used to describe Bud at his funeral.
Zrínyi u., 1051
One of the most visited and famous statues in Budapest is the fat policeman — you can tell by his shiny belly. His location couldn’t get any better as he gets to stare at the St. Stephan's Basilica all day. Tourists can’t help but get a snap of themselves with him.
The fat policeman statue in central Budapest was sculptured by Illyés András in 2008, and can be found on the corner of Zrínyi and Október 6. Street. The sculpture itself was based on the characteristics of peoples faces dwelling in the city, with the portly physique taken from the sculptors grandfather.
Práter u. 11, 1082
This collection of statues portrays a group of boys playing marbles outside an old brick school building. It is a depiction of a scene early on in the book Pál utcai fiúk — the Paul Street Boys.
You’ll find this gem just round the corner from Corvin Shopping Plaza.
This book by Hungarian author Ferenc Molnár tells the story of two gangs of children fighting over rundown territory. The book became hugely popular and turned into a famous Hungarian classic, still taught in primary school.
NB — If you like this story, the National Museum in Budapest has created a marble run and area in honour of the Pal Street Boys — perfect for young kids!
Walking Tour Idea — If you're looking for a street map of these statues, check out our link here.
Falk Miksa u., 1055
Columbo is one of Hungary’s most admired characters — it might have something to do with Peter Falk’s Hungarian heritage. His mother, a Jewish Hungarian emigrated to the States before he was born.
His statue shows his typical thinking posture with cigar in hand, while his basset hound dog named ‘dog’ stares at him patiently. Funnily enough, the statue was placed opposite the National Comedy Theatre, and visible from Jászai Mari square.
Dob u. 12, 1072
Carl Lutz was the Budapest based Swiss Vice-Consul from 1942 until 1945 — the end of World War II. As a designer and leader of the largest most successful rescue operation, he was instrumental in saving more than 62,000 Hungarian Jews. In fact, Budapest is the only capital in Eastern Europe where enough Hungarian Jews survived to continue their community — over 100,000.
You’ll find these statues one block away from the Dohány Street Synagogue’s Tree Of Life. The inscription reads: In the building at Szabadság tér 12, Swiss Vice Consul Carl Lutz honorably represented the interests of the United States of America and other countries between 1942 and 1945. He courageously saved the lives of tens of thousands of Hungarian citizens persecuted as Jews.
Belgrád rkp., 1051
The Little Princess statue is one of the most famous sculptures in Budapest because of its perfect location. This statuette sits on the railings next to the pedestrian area on the Pest side of the Danube and scenic Tram 2. Expect great views and a perfect place for photographs.
The artist, László Marton created this in 1972, taking his eldest daughter as inspiration. Apparently, she would wear his dressing gown and parade around as a princess. This statue is so loved that copies have sprung up in the Hungarian town of Tapolca and in front of the concert hall of the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Space in Japan.
Szabadság tér 16, 1054
Ronald Reagan is a little strange as a statue in Budapest, let alone in the very important Freedom Square (Szabadság tér). It feels out of place until you realise it was created to honour Reagan and his efforts in ending the cold war. The end of the cold war would end the Soviet occupation of Hungary.
The positioning is perfect — not only is he walking toward the American Embassy, he is also staring at the monument dedicated to the Soviet liberation of Hungary in World War II from Nazi German occupation.
Vajdahunyad stny, City Park, 1146
One of the most fascinating statues in Budapest is the one known as ‘Anonymous’, and definitely one of my favourites. The hooded man is sitting in a relaxed pose, holding a pen. An inscription starts with a capital ‘P’, and continues with “dictus magister ac quondam bone memorie gloriosissimi Bele regis Hungarie notarius” (and Bela the master of the king of Hungary was struck by the notary who were once of the most glorious of good memory). The ‘P’ is likely his name, or an abbrev. of praedictus, meaning ‘aforementioned’.
The anonymous statue of Budapest was the notary of the Hungarian king Béla III, and famous for his work Gesta Hungarorum (“The Deeds of the Hungarians”) over 800 years ago. It’s the most detailed account of the Hungarians’ arrival to the Carpathian basin. Being a very important writer, people make their way to the inner court area of the Vajdahunyad Castle to touch his pen, and receive special, ungodly writing powers. Worth a try.
These statues of peoples shoes on the Danube river bank hold on to one of the haunting and saddest situations in Hungary’s history. These 60 pairs of shoes are a memory to those who were killed by Arrow Cross Party in 1944–45. Let’s back up a little.
When Germany waged war through Europe, it was only a matter of time before their attention came to Hungary. The government was overthrown in October 1944, Ferenc Szalasi was the puppet that took the job. His fascist and antisemitic ideas were poured into the Arrow Cross Party, who beat and killed Jewish citizens of the city.
As shoes were valuable, the victims were made to remove their shoes before being executed and left to fall into the cold, strong current of the Danube. Almost 100,000 Jews vanished. 80,000 Jews left the country by force, and the other 20,000 were shot along the river banks. These life-sized shoes with amazing detail were installed in 2005 by Can Togay (Director; The Summer Guest) and Gyula Pauer (Sculptor).

It was the summer of 2015. My husband and I travelled to Budapest with our son and his better half.
Our three-day trip to the city was the most enjoyable and unforgettable. Budapest has a distinct charm, and its glorious setting astride the Danube River makes it a great place to visit.
The Budapest vacation helped us to build lifelong memories and break away from the usual hectic routine. It allowed us to enjoy a new culture, food and experiences.
The Szenchenyi chain bridge spans the river Danube between Buda on the western side and Pest on the eastern side. It is a permanent bridge across the Danube in Hungary. A series of bridges connect Buda and Pest.
Budapest is the most beautiful city on the Danube. The city’s panorama is breathtaking, and you can enjoy the most when on a cruise ship.
The best part of the tour was taking a cruise down the Danube, passing landmarks like the National Parliament and Buda Castle. It was an incredible experience!
Especially in the evening hours when you get to see the illuminated parliament. You get to enjoy the complimentary welcome drink as you take in the sights of the city.
The Liberty bridge is the southernmost public road bridge in Budapest. It is the shortest bridge in the centre of Budapest.
Our Funicular ride to the Buda Castle was enjoyable. You get a captivating view of the city below.
Buda Castle is a remarkable castle. The National Gallery, National Library and the History Museum are located inside this castle. It sits on the top of the castle hill.
We enjoyed the old-fashioned pastry shops and many good cafes and restaurants — a must-see place for anyone visiting Budapest.
Every colourful dish was equally inviting, and it was difficult to resist the temptation to gobble them all up!
The Dohany Synagogue was very close to our Airbnb. It is the largest European synagogue and has a seating arrangement for nearly 3000 people.
You can see travellers clicking pictures of the interior. You get to see the brilliant Tohrah Ark made of coloured and golden geometric shapes.
The weeping willow tree is in the synagogue's backyard. It has metal leaves on which family names of Hungarian Jews murdered in the Holocaust are carved.
On the last day of our stay, we visited the St Gerard Sagredo statue. It is one of the historical landmarks in Budapest.
The views from this place on top of the hill are stunning — one of the most visited attractions in Budapest.
Heroes Square is one of the major squares in Budapest. It has the museum of fine arts on the left and the Palace of art on the right.
The central feature is the Millennium memorial. The two colonnades behind the monument each have seven statues representing significant figures of Hungarian history.
“Travelling in the company of those we love is home in motion.”- Leigh Hunt.
The most significant benefit of family travel is bonding with the dearest people in your life and exploring places together.
Every year we look forward to family travel, visiting a new place, exploring and creating memories.

Today, coffee is more than just a drink; it’s a necessary component of the traditional morning ritual. Coffee plays an essential role in daily life, whether you stumble out of bed and head straight for the cafetière or impatiently wait in line, hoping the barista rushes to serve you a flat white so you can get to work on time. Coffee has become a cultural phenomenon embedded in societies worldwide, but the journey of coffee stretches far beyond the early-morning hustle of today’s world. In Budapest, coffee is one of the many threads of the city’s rich tapestry. This documentary, Budapest’s Coffee Obsession, takes audiences on a historical exploration of rich brewing techniques through the travels of coffee lover Lyrkan Thuery. This paper will begin by conducting a brief textual analysis of two screen productions: Rise of Empires: Ottomans (2020) and The Story Of Coffee (2016). The analysis of the two…

Travelling and seeing as many places as I can is a passion. It has never been solely about showcasing pictures just for the sake of it. It’s always been about the culture, community, language of communication, behaviour of the people, the structures, monuments, the history behind it and more such. It’s about knowing and absorbing and sharing this knowledge through written work and of course images corresponding to them.
Two days spent in Budapest, the capital of Hungary 🇭🇺 was like having been there for a long time. The way we devoured the sights of this city divided in two parts by the Danube River was just nothing short of amazing. This is an enchanting city with a vintage feel. Though the whole of Europe has an old world charm, there are differences in the structures and monuments from city to city.
We left on a Sunday morning by train from Vienna to Budapest with our daughter and family. It took only a little more than two and a half hours. The train was super comfortable where we could play card games with our little grandson who was our chief entertainer. Once there we took local trams and trains, hopping in and out of them to get around. But it was mostly a walking tour with our 4 year old in tow. He had his scooter and stroller when he required them. In his name we took a few ice cream and snack breaks. It was 35 degrees in the scorching sun which we combated with water, hats and sunscreen, running to the shaded parts of the promenades whenever possible.
After checking in at the hotel in Pest, we headed to Vajdahunyad Castle. It is a grand castle which has parts of buildings from different time periods displaying varied architectural styles. Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque. Its facade looks like a fairy tale castle. It’s an amazing amalgamation with a vast garden around it. This castle with vibrant stain glass windows, houses a museum of the Hungarian life over the years. It features their farming culture, use of animals such as cattle and horses. All the floors are lined with portrayals of the village life. Our grandson had an exciting time in the castle museum looking and touching all the stuffed real looking animals. He could even milk a fake cow.
The garden at the castle is vast, well tended and lush.
There is a sinister looking statue of a hooded person in the courtyard. It reminded me of ‘He who must not be named’ or Lord Voldemort from Harry Potter. It is the statue of Anonymus, created by Miklós Ligeti. Anonymus was a 12th-century chronicler whose real name remains a mystery. He served as a notary to King. He inspired the Dracula stories in books and movies. On the outer wall of the castle, there’s also a bust of Béla Lugosi, the Hungarian-American actor who is renowned for his role as Count Dracula in the original 1931 film.
While coming out of the castle grounds, we saw a hot air balloon at a distance. Naturally we walked towards it to go up in the air on it. When we approached the ticket counter and enquired we were told the balloon will go up only at 6 pm. It was only noon time and it was impossible to come back for it. We all felt ‘deflated’ by it.
Budapest is made up of two formerly separate cities, Buda and Pest, which lie on opposite sides of the Danube River. The Chain Bridge, which we saw from a distance, completed in 1849, was the first to connect them. In 1873, the two cities were officially unified under the name Budapest. We remained in the Pest side as we didn’t have time to go to Buda. Perhaps when we come next, we can only cover Buda, which apparently is a classier and more residential part of the city.
In spite of the intense heat, we lingered at the banks of the Danube which reflected the blue of the sky with a few boats floating on it. We saw the majestic looking Parliament building, which is the largest building in Hungary. Built in 1904, it’s a gothic structure influenced by the City Hall in Vienna. It’s declared as a UNESCO Heritage site.
While searching online for places to visit, my daughter came across this powerful memorial. Lined along the riverbank are worn looking cast iron shoes, symbolizing the Jewish victims shot into the Danube during World War II. Seeing it deeply moved me, as it brought the horrors of that time to life. This was created by film director Can Togay and sculptor Gyula Pauer. It honours Jews killed by members of the Arrow Cross Party. Victims were forced to remove their shoes before being shot, their bodies falling into the river. The memorial marks the place where they stood ..only their shoes remained.
The one regret I have is not having been able to go across the famous Chain Bridge to Buda. I looked at it longingly, the beauty of it enhanced by the blue of the Danube. Designed by English engineer William Tierney Clark and built by Scottish engineer Adam Clark, it was the first bridge across the Danube in Hungary. It was opened in 1849.
We stayed in Pest as it’s the livelier side, full of attractions, and it’s where most tourists end up wanting to spend their time in Budapest. It was crowded in the popular squares of the area where we stopped in shaded cafes to have cool drinks. Great for people watching. The Intercity Hotel was very comfortable. We slept well out of sheer exhaustion that night and had a filling breakfast in the morning.
Next day we went in search of The Metropolitan Ervin Szabó Library in Budapest, famous for its vintage interiors. It is a sprawling public library complex, with its main structure in an ornate 19th-century former palace, built in neo baroque style. Unfortunately we could not go into the classical side because there was a film shooting going on. What a disappointment! We had to make do with wandering in the less interesting part where there was a modern lending library. We admired the facade and had lunch at a near by open restaurant with our little hero making up games and running all around. I had an interesting salad with sun-dried tomatoes, red lettuce and Hungarian cheese topped with blueberry marmalade.
We debated going to Buda for a quick visit but we were not sure whether we would get back to the train station in time for our return. We decided to go and see the largest synagogue in Europe which was a few minutes walk away. It is a magnificent structure built between 1854 and 1859. It has twin octagonal towers topped by onion domes which has an oriental touch. The Star of David is embossed into the stone tablets. There is alternating yellow and red brick work on the imposing building ..standing the test of time.
Again sadly we could not go in because it was time to get back to our hotel for our luggage and head to the station. But we were happy to view the awe inspiring facade.
Some of the underground metro stations take you back in time like the late 1800s or early 1900s because of its vintage feel. It is compact and quaint in its tiled look with wooden benches and frames. Took me back into another era. Loved the ageless feeling while waiting for train which itself looked as if it was from another time long past. I visualised suited, hatted gentlemen with their canes or hooked umbrellas and slender women in long frocks and fashionable hats of that time waiting at the station.
I forgot to mention the street book shop that we saw while walking towards the Ervin Sazbo Library. It was heartening to see the lovely colourful cart with hoards of books surrounded by eager buyers. Mostly Hungarian books, so we didn’t delve further. We also passed by a big well organised secondhand book store with books from floor to ceiling.
Though there were hardly any books in English, it was a sight to behold and to be photographed.
On Sunday after our sightseeing and long walks in the hot sun, we went for dinner in a restaurant where they served beverages on little trains. This place was chosen for the youngest and most important traveller in our group. We ordered Hungarian food and drinks. It was fascinating to see the drinks coming on mini trains. There were railway tracks on every table. There was live music by musicians who came from table to table. They played a Greek song for us at our request along with Hungarian and German. It was a unique experience.
On our return train, I dozed off almost half the way vaguely listening to the little fella’s chatter like a lullaby in the background. Felt good to be back to our present turf reminiscing about the two days well spent in Budapest, thanks to our daughter and son in law. A special thanks to the little one for entertaining us all through.

I wasn’t ready for Budapest.
In 2004, T, my sister, brother-in-law, and I found super cheap flights to Budapest and decided to travel there on a whim. Being that it was 2004, Budapest wasn’t on many travelers’ radars like it is now.
Of course we expected it to be beautiful, much like many of the other European cities we had previously visited. But we had no idea just how majestic and spellbinding Budapest truly is. A magical merge of striking allure, historical grandeur, and cutting-edge grittiness that had us enamored right from the start.
There are so many things to love about Budapest, but here’s a good start: it’s brimming with stunning architecture, amazing thermal baths, breathtaking views, and a distinguished culture.
Still not convinced? It’s extraordinarily affordable, especially when compared to many other European cities.
Below are the top ten things to do in beautiful Budapest.
One of the most iconic landmarks in all of Hungary, the Parliament Building is a spectacular example of exquisite Neo-Gothic architecture. This masterpiece of a building is a popular tourist attraction, equally due to its magnificent splendor and idyllic location along the meandering Danube River. It’s worth walking around the back as well to get the full scale of its grandness, as well as the sheer beauty of the structure.
Hailing as the second longest river in all of Europe, it’s pretty much impossible to miss this imposing Danube River. Riverside strolls and sails are not only a must here, they’re pretty much inevitable. The Danube River is the beating pulse of Budapest, coursing its way through the expansive city.
Fun fact: The capital city of Budapest was the result of the unification of separate towns of Buda and Pest in 1873.
One of the many things we loved about Budapest is its walkability, and perhaps nowhere within the city encourages individuals to explore it by foot than the Szechnyi Chain Bridge.The pedestrian-friendly bridge offers fantastic views of both Buda and Pest and is one of the main bridges in Budapest that links the majority of sites.
Perched upon Castle Hill, Fisherman’s Bastion is a remarkable spot to enjoy panoramic views of the river and Pest beyond it. Its historical charm and opulence outweigh the fellow tourists that will inevitable accompany your visit. Think striking towers, spilling-over terraces, and attractive cobbled streets. A lovely spot to soak up Budapest’s radiance.
This luxurious historical castle and royal palace complex pays homage to the Hungarian kings. As the most prominent building of Castle Hill, it dominates the hill and provides beyond impressive views of the city and river. While it’s worth visiting at any time of the day, nightfall is particularly special when it’s dramatically illuminated.
Thing to know: Riding the funicular is a relatively cheap and scenic way to reach the Buda Castle hill. Click here for rates and hours of operation.
Promise me this: you will not leave Budapest without visiting at least one of its delightful spas and soaking in its thermal baths. One of the highlights of our trip was spending an afternoon at Gellert Spa and Bath. Dating back to 1918, Gellert Baths is one of the city’s oldest and most famous bathhouses.
The building’s interior is ornate and lavish, with a number of various wellness treatments offered. My sister and I opted for a massage and soak in the heated pools. Note that the establishment does get busy, so you may want to go on the earlier (or later) side in hopes of avoiding large crowds. We visited later in the day and found the spa and pools to be pretty quiet. Remember to pack your swimwear and some thick skin-the Hungarian masseuses are known to be very strong and firm (I can definitely attest to this!).
It should be no surprise that Hungarian food is HEAVY. Stick-to-your-ribs heavy. But also, pretty damn delicious. Depending on what time of year you travel to Hungary, your level of appreciation for its gluttonous heavy ways may vary. It was cold during our travels, and our bellies and souls craved as much warming comfort food as we could possibly get. So you might say that we welcomed all of its savory goulashes, stews, and soups with open hearts and eager tastebuds.
Hungarian cuisine is the epitome of comfort food, and we wouldn’t have wanted it any other way.
Hands down the best meal of the trip was at Gundel, a formal restaurant that serves delicious gourmet Hungarian fare.
There is no shortage of grand and historical coffeehouses in Budapest. If you need to seek some solace from the cold, you are in for a real treat-we absolutely loved the cafe scene here. The most charming and delightful of all of the cafes that we visited was Gerbaud, an elegant cafe that’s worthy of the hype (and elevated prices).
The coffee, pastries, and desserts were decadently divine. We absolutely loved it here.
As mentioned previously, Budapest is a gloriously walkable city, with an efficient and reliable metro system to boot, making it a very easy city to explore. Take the time to meander and marvel at the unique architecture, iconic sites, and distinctive neighborhoods.
Heroes’ Square St. Stephen’s Basilica
Okay, so technically not in Budapest, but beautiful and lovely nonetheless, is Szentendre, an enchanting and picturesque Hungarian town alongside the Danube. A short and simple forty-five minute train ride delivers you directly to the quaint little village of a town, characterized by baroque architecture, historical churches, colorful houses and narrow, cobbled streets.
The charming main square and alleyways are lined with museum and art galleries, adorable shops and boutiques, and cozy restaurants and cafes.
We were captivated by Szentendre’s beauty and quietness. An absolutely delightful day trip from Budapest!
Four full days gave us a great introduction to the amazingness of Budapest. With its more recent rise in popularity, I’d love to return one day, especially to see how much the city has changed. Wishing you the happiest of travels to beautiful Budapest and beyond!

Budapest has become one of the top tourist destinations in Europe, for a good reason. Often, we do not recognize the beauty of the place that we live in anymore. But Budapest is simply amazing, and there is no reason to argue about it. It is not a city to tick in one or two days. Here you can easily spend a week discovering something new. But as in every place, being a tourist or live and work somewhere are two different things. Read till the end of this article if you want to know more about the complex image and the less charming sides of Budapest as well.
After having been to several corners of Europe, I can say that Budapest is the most picturesque city at night when it is enveloped in lights. No, it is not Paris. Budapest is the city divided by the river Danube into two parts, Buda as Pest. Hence the name Budapest.
I can be bored of seeing Jungfrau in Switzerland, the picturesque villages of Austria, or the countless churches of Italy. Still, I cannot cross the river Danube without throwing an eye on the ensemble of stunning monuments (The Buda castle, The Fisherman’s Bastion, The Chain Bridge, the…

A travel essay about Budapest and London, written in Copenhagen, Frankfurt, and Zagreb. I think I need to grow some roots.
Onwards!👇
When I’d come back from London, last year, I was flooded with splendor and grandiosity, yes, but was also sticky with the smell of a city that was once a heart of an empire but isn’t quite any longer. This smell emanated from every statue, monument, and stolid building. It oozed from the English gardens, swelled and dissipated with the Thames, fluttered on the rooftops like drunken pigeons. Even the somber tolling of the Big Ben carried with it an obvious verdict — an end to an era. London is well on its way to becoming just another capital city, albeit with a few more trinkets to auction, and a rather nasty sting in the form of the Trident nuclear missiles.
Coming back from Budapest I am flooded with a similar feeling, although it is far more nuanced and light. Hungary was once a rather significant European power (at least until the arrival of Ottomans and the collapse of so much European hubris). It extended all the way to Dalmatia and Slavonia in Croatia, something that is still touted by the old coat of arms scattered throughout the city — on the faces of buildings, forts, and magnificent bridges.
The city itself is monumental and even monolithic. It boasts elaborate facades studded with gargoyles, satires, and that European animal rarer than the unicorn, leprechaun, and Baba Yaga together. I am talking, of course, about the common African lion which the Europeans have elevated above every other animal of much greater use, economy, and industry. The lion can roar, yes, but is otherwise rather lazy and disinterested in the plight of both lionkind and mankind. Which, come to think of it, does a decent job of summarizing royalty worldwide.
Fine then, let the lion stand.
Walking through the streets of Budapest one eventually emerges onto the Hero Square, or the Hungarian Parliament Building, or Istvan Basilica. These buildings, along with many others, impart one of the most salient impressions of the city.
Nothing is small.
The streets are long, straight, and immensely wide, even the side streets. There are no London back alleys in Budapest. Buildings don’t come in sizes smaller than big. Some, like the Hungarian Parliament Building or the Széchenyi Medicinal Bath, are so large that it is easy to feel lost while walking their perimeter, let alone wandering their innards. Then there’s the Buda Castle on the Castle Hill, Hungarian National Library, St. Stephen’s Basilica, and a myriad of edifices that all carry with them a particularly Hungarian flavor — the beauty of Budapest architecture is incredible, improbable even, and unapologetically big.
The city has, since the 20s, been called the City of Baths, owing to the many thermal springs that soak its foundation — there are at least 6 in Budapest proper, and over a thousand in the whole of Hungary. The country essentially consists of boiling water, a few layers of dirt, and a city thrown on top, here and there.
We soaked our bodies in the Szechenyi Baths along with a thousand other people, of all colors, from every corner of the world, even those that now mostly supply the nameless people on the Hungarian fenced borders, trusting in the healing properties of thermal springs that contained sulfites and smelled the part.
The Bath itself is enormous, covering more than 6000 square meters, and boasting both indoor and outdoor thermal pools of varying temperatures. The largest outdoor pool is a special experience, particularly in the winter, with 36-degree water in 2-degree weather. Needless to say, the scalp gets a little chilly. There I also noticed a pandemic of a disease whose symptoms terrorize attention, ruin sleep, and cause a strange craning of the neck. I’m talking, of course, of the infernal smartphone whose allure seems so immense that the bathers couldn’t seem to bear parting with them, even in the pool. This forced them to hold one hand outside the water in the cold air, somewhat like the hand waving of English royalty, that is to say, dumb and unnecessary.
Since my smartphone habits are less than exemplary, I write this with slight rudeness to my cheek.
The city is nestled in a valley of hills and offers both flat grounds to cycle on and slopes to climb. In Budapest, unlike Copenhagen where I live, one has a use for the Achilles heel.
On one of the days we set out to explore the Grand Market but by the time we managed to saunter toward it, it had closed, leaving us only with a sight of its iridescent roof tiles. These tiles, called the Zsolnay tiles, are one of the most memorable sights in Budapest if you’re into that kind of a thing, which you are probably not. Neither am I, but these tiles still persist in my memory for reasons that remain unaccounted for.
With the closed doors of the Grand Market behind us, we set off across the magnificent Szabadság Bridge that joins its brethren in spanning the wide, mighty, and lazy Danube River. Even though it flows through Croatia, I’d never seen the Danube before and it was a curious feeling to know that, only a three hour drive downstream, my father had grown up in the town of Borovo, fishing and splashing his way through a childhood so far removed from mine that it sometimes seems almost fantastical.
On the other side of the river stands yet another monumental building. This time it’s the Gellért Thermal Bath whose pools gaped empty that day like the hands of a beggar who once knew splendor.
The Gellért Baths squat in the shadow of Gellért Hill, which was named after Saint Gerard who was allegedly thrown down its slopes to meet a gruesome death. The crown jewel of the hilL is the Liberty Statue, erected by the Soviets as a token to themselves for the liberation of Hungary at the end of WWII. The inscription on the bottom originally read:
“To the memory of the liberating Soviet heroes erected by the grateful Hungarian people in 1945.”
After the overthrow of communism in Europe, the inscription was later changed to:
“To the memory of those all who sacrificed their lives for the independence, freedom, and prosperity of Hungary.”
I found it an interesting example of how history, once decided upon, can certainly be changed, and changed again if need be.
Be that as it may, hundreds of people milled about the Liberty Statue under an angry, frozen Sun — some examining the high walls above, some examining the city below, but most, as you can imagine, examining the smartphone in their hands.
Of our own conduct I will not say much, except that we’d opted to breathe in the hazy vista that blankets the horizon, entwining people, nature, and the city of Budapest into a memory of a few short days touched by the long thoughts of history.
Thank you for reading.

Will: Budapest has commonly been part of a list some people call “The Four B’s of Europe”.
Belgrade, Barcelona, Budapest, and Berlin.
These are widely considered the best party cities on the continent. “Party” is subjective, but the common theme between these cities is that they all have robust club and bar scenes that are famous for many reasons. Budapest is unique because the bars have a certain type of grit, which makes them mysterious. They are usually underground, decrepit, and extremely old. But this gives them an indescribable atmosphere.
Carolina: Throughout our relationship, Will and I constantly joke about the ""Hungarian caves"" as we like to call the Budapestian bars. Personally, while my days of party raging are behind me, I do enjoy an occasional ~causal clubbing~ night out and was excited to see what Budapest had to offer.
The expectations were: cheap drinks, quirky bars, and great house music.
If we haven't mentioned it already, I regret to inform you that it turns out Budapest isn't as cheap as they say. We were disappointed to find that drink prices were on par with what we commonly find in the U.S. — $5 beers and $12 cocktails. There were, however, a few spots closer to the local and low-key end of the spectrum that we truly enjoyed.
Kisüzem (1st and 2nd photos above) is a casual sit-down bar on the outskirts of the Jewish Quarter where Will and I got to enjoy $4 beers and $9 cocktails.
It was the perfect place to kick off a night out or even just to grab some drinks and chat. While the vibes of Kisüzem were very relaxed, it was extremely hard to score a table or even a windowsill to sit on outside. Most of the people were chatting in Hungarian — which made it seem like a popular spot amongst the locals.
Will: The most famous (probably) tourist bar in Budapest is known as Szimpla Kert (pictured above). It’s interchangeable with the “ruins bar” and is usually the first result on Google for the query “Best bars in Budapest”. When people say “ruins bars”, they are talking about this place, which is located in the heart of the Jewish Quarter. It’s a little confusing, but it’s not “bars” plural in the sense that there are individual “bars” within the building; Szimpla Kert is a bar that has several places to buy drinks within it. Makes sense?
It’s an incredible space with multiple levels and plenty of room to roam. Inside is straight out of a Jackson-Pollack-painting-come-to-life. Various, random knick-knacks cover the walls and ceiling while each room is draped in vibrant lights. As large as it is, they still manage to pack it night after night, especially in the high season. Caro and I tried to go on a Friday around midnight, and the line was horrid. The appeal of this place is valid, and I’ll say it’s a definite must if you’re planning on going out to Budapest. Price-wise you can expect beers ranging from $5-$9 and cocktails for about $9–$13.
Carolina: Szimpla Kert is truly a sight to behold. A big part of the experience is getting lost in the maze of bars. Each one of them has its unique atmosphere. However, don't mistake this for a bar to go dancing at. While they do play music, there isn't a dance floor. Instead, there are tables where people gather around and sit to talk or play cards like we did.
Will: When it’s time to go dancing, there is one option that could satisfy everybody’s musical taste. It’s called Instant/Fogas, and it’s the most insane club I’ve ever seen. For Caro and I, this was it — the CAVES!
It has 6 (yes, 6) different rooms. On the entry floor, there are two large dance halls, one playing house music and the other playing general pop and throwback dance bangers from the likes of Madonna, Lady Gaga, Brittany, and Black Eyed Peas. The entry floor also has 4 to 5 bars, so getting a drink is no issue.
Downstairs, however, below the street, is where the complexity of Fogas can be truly celebrated. The Fogas underground features three distinct caves: heavy metal & rock, techno, and deep house. Each is separated by thick concrete and has its own bar. Being down there makes you feel incredibly edgy, but downstairs is where Fogas is the most fun. The music is great, the rooms are very spacious, and the overall vibe can’t be replicated. Granted, there are other underground bars in Budapest, but none like this. You feel the mysteriousness and grit of the city in a very unique way.
Carolina: For someone who likes to go dancing and has a Frankenstein music taste like mine, the Instant-Fogas Complex was a dream come true. However, I gotta say that there was another bar that stood out against all others. That was Viadukt, a Danube-side bar hidden underneath the trolley tracks.
During the day, the bar's green-painted metal doors are hard to distinguish from the other ones that are part of the viaduct where the trolly passes through. At night, the road becomes pedestrian-only, a black canopy tent is set up outside with a DJ playing house music sets, and tables and chairs distributed among the Danube bank. The green metal doors are wide open and the inside is decorated with an exhibition from a local artist. There's plenty of space to dance by the DJ and to sit and chat a bit further where the music isn't as loud. Regardless of where you decide to hang out, you get to enjoy the gorgeous lights of Buda across the river as well as a view of the Széchenyi Chain Bridge.
Both Viadukt and Instant-Fogas served their drinks in reusable branded plastic cups which Will and I kept. So, if we host you once we're back home, there's a chance that you might get to enjoy a drink from the cups we brought from Budapest.

This is the story of one of the least appealing things I have ever eaten. And also, of friendship. But mostly it’s about the unappealing thing. Read at your own risk.
…
You’re still here? Alright… let’s do this.
The November rain in Budapest seems to stick in the air like an impenetrable damp fog. The buildings are grandiose but muted, the people walk with their heads down, not in a hurry, but simply uninterested in their surroundings. I’ve traveled here with Garrett, a dry humored Canadian who has just come aboard the kitchen at my job in Sweden. With a week off of work, we agree to try a short trip together.
We are on the edge of town, searching for a local’s restaurant that one of us saw on some travel TV program. We’ve ridden away from the water that cuts between Buda and Pest, past the ornate museums and old sandstone buildings, and beyond the golden roofs. We are in a residential neighborhood now, drab Eastern European blocks houses, Soviet in look and feel; the sky here seems even more grey than before, the colors of the painted buildings seem a touch more muted.
We find Pléhcsárda hidden behind another small shack of a restaurant. The whole operation looks like a trailer set up in a trailer park. The dining room is a single table set up in front of the ordering window, which looks like it was made of…

Back on the rails, listening to stories and walking the ragged end of Budapest’s nineth district. To reach a nearby built-up area rather than retrace my steps through a wasteland with the occasional industrial complex I had spent the morning exploring on foot, I must cross six railway tracks with no formal crossing point. I watch a woman navigate the rails from the other side of the tracks and ask her advice about gaps in the fence there between road and rail before stepping out. With some trepidation. It is just three months since I fell down a railway embankment outside of Sofia in Bulgaria breaking my ankle and putting my Belt-Road tour from Beijing to Europe on hold as I limped back to London on crutches.
In contrast to earlier sections of the Belt-Road’s Middle Passage, many rail tracks connect Sofia, the first stop in Europe with the rest of the continent. I settle on the route through Bucharest in Romania, skirting around Belgrade in Serbia where, as in Bucharest, stories of Chinese investments suggest built, financial and social landscapes reformatted. Leaving the ground for a moment and taking a more abstract view from above, these stories boil down to minimising regulations, short-circuiting tendering processes, riding rough shod over environmental regulations, confiscating land and poor compensation: all in the rush to begin construction. Beneath these stories are cash-strapped local economies, anxious politicians and local elites eager for Chinese finance and the profits they bring while local citizens pay off the loans through their taxes and watch the disappearance of public land. Budapest fits this description too. China’s direct investment in Hungary (2023) is more than US$8 billion, by far Europe’s biggest share.
Back on the ground, the wasteland I spent the morning exploring on the ragged edge of Budapest’s nineth district is the site of China’s first university in Europe; Fudan Hungary University announced to great fanfare by both governments in 2021. I walk towards it across three and four line highways, elevated routeways made for traffic not walking and dotted with corporate offices. The BYD offices sit here along with a string of high-end car dealerships and the ‘Dream Store’ that sells bathroom fittings. BYD — which stands for Build Your Dreams — is the Chinese electric car and world-leading battery manufacturer hedging its bets on sanctions against China by setting up factories inside the EU. So far it’s Hungarian operations only makes batteries, but car factories are planned and reported to be in construction in other parts of the country.
I walk past construction sites confirming the feeling that this is one of the city’s edges, a place where Budapest is still being built. One of these has blue shipping containers stacked and creatively repurposed as housing and bathrooms for construction workers. I wander around marvelling at the use of surplus Chinese containers — trade between the two countries is asymmetrical — until a man in a high vis jacket throws me out. Next I pass the stylish white tubular athletics stadium on the edge of the area where the university is supposed to be. I can see no university, no ground being prepared, no suggestion of construction, only a large tract of scrub land in autumnal browns and yellows and an impressive derelict building that is gently falling down in the distance.
Walking further I find the exact place where the university might be but isn’t. I only know this from the street names — Dali Lama, Uyghur Martyrs, Free Hong Kong and Bishop Xi Shinguang of China’s underground Catholic Church. Krisztiana Baranyi, mayor of the nineth district, renamed the streets on which the new university would sit so as to annoy the Chinese Government and discourage the university’s construction. Popular protests erupted in 2021. Building didn’t start then and the scheme didn’t deliver a completed campus by 2024 as reports claimed it would. Optimistic news reports and announcements from both the Chinese and the Hungarian side insist that there would be five to six thousand students enrolled in shiny new buildings and five hundred staff at this outpost of China’s top tier university system by 2024. Instead there is no university; only a piece of wasteland waiting for something to happen.
Local citizens protesting the scheme object to the appropriation of city land for the education of elite students. The Budapest branch of Shanghai’s top tier university intended to charge the sort of fees most Hungarian students couldn’t afford, making it a resource only for the wealthiest. City plans earlier earmarked this area as a ‘student city’ intending it to be used to build low cost rental accommodation for students and young academics. The estimated costs of building Fudan in Budapest is in the region of E1.5 billion — more than Hungary’s Higher Education operating budget for 2019 — to be financed by a loan from China repaid by Hungarian tax payers. A Chinese contractor mired in scandal — China State Construction Engineering Corporation — would build the university using Chinese labour and materials making it hard to see the benefit for local people. Perhaps most controversially of all, delivery of this project is the responsibility of a Board of Trustees, headed by the Minister of Culture. Although there is no university and no project to manage, the Board of Trustees is paid E1.5 million a year — to date E16 million — for maintenance and operating costs on non-existent buildings despite not even having an office nor producing any activity reports (Daily News Hungary 13 August 2023).
A source close to the mayor told me that the university project hasn’t gone away, but as the Hungarian Government runs out of money it has stopped or slowed a number of expensive Chinese investment projects including the Fudan campus. Another story was offered by a taxi driver taking me to Budapest Keleti station for my train to Germany and the last stop on my Belt-Road tour. He understood that the mayor had secured permission for the athletics stadium to be built in the nineth district if the university proposal was dropped. He says that while the university project isn’t a secret, ‘no one talks about it’, although Fudan University and other Chinese projects indicate radically different directions in Budapest’s future.
Bigger stories run along these rails through Hungary too. Orbán’s Fidesz Party is desperate to attract Chinese finance, even now signing deals for factories, security systems to ‘combat terrorism’ and new railway connections to Belgrade and Budapest airport. Media reports show that Orbán’s closest local allies if not Orbán himself benefit from Chinese contracts. But the biggest story of all is geopolitical. Among many rosy statements about Chinese-Hungarian cooperation and solidarity, Xi Jinping loudly proclaims that Hungary is in China’s inner ‘circle of friends’. By this he means those countries that do the most to support China’s efforts to counter US power and influence in the world. Hungary’s rail tracks are the front line in tilting the axis of global power in China’s direction: offer a new vision for how the world might work (Financial Times 11 May 2024). This makes the rails that run through Budapest and its non-existent university a very big deal indeed.

I visited Budapest in 1990 very soon after the fall of the Iron Curtain, when the first glimmers of open gay life were just starting to show — nervous glimmers indeed compared to the astounding turnout of an estimated 200,000 people at the LGBTQ+ Pride march in the Hungarian capital on the 28th June 2025, the march expanding from a previous peak of 35,000 people as people came together in defiance of a ban put on the assembly by the Prime Minister, Viktor Orban.
In 1990 the gays in Budapest were not visible. There was a bar or two in the fashionable city centre where Spartacus, the gay guide to the world that every gay traveler kept in their backpack in those days, said gays were welcome. They were in no way gay bars — and the only club in town was in a discrete backstreet location some distance from the centre, had no signage to indicate its presence — but once inside I found a fledgling gay scene taking its first, nervous, steps. People were shy and guarded, but the music was good and we danced. I remember meeting a Russian ballet dancer. That was it. Gays were definitely not in the news. The big story in Budapest at the time was the opening of their first MacDonalds.
28th June this year was the 56th anniversary of the start of the Stonewall Riots in New York, the moment that is regarded as the kicking off point for the Gay Pride movement that emerged in the 1970s. As a direct consequence of the Hungarian government’s vindictive attack on the LGBTQ+ community, the world now sees how far the Hungarian people have come in accepting their queer brothers, sisters and children — this anniversary year may stand out in history as something like Hungary’s own Stonewall moment.
But no riot in Budapest. Despite threats to use facial recognition software and fine attendees, in the end the government directed the police to not harass participants and although they also gave permission to right wing groups to stage counter protests, nothing of any significance emerged from that. Instead a massive parade celebrating love in all its forms with attendees from 40 countries, stretched through the city. The photos and videos are incredible.
The beauty, harmony, love, peacefulness and joy on display revealed how utterly phobic and toxic the homophobic attitude of the ruling party is. The official ban was justified on the grounds of Pride being a danger to children — which simply reveals the dark minds of those proposing the ban, who are actually projecting their own dark thoughts onto gay people when they see us as sexual deviants and predators. Pride is not about sex, it’s about freedom — and knowing that, many heterosexuals walked in the march too.
Hungary is not the only eastern European country in which right wing politicians are stoking public debate about gay and trans people to fire up their base and to distract from anti-democratic legislation which they are pushing through their parliaments. It’s happening in Slovenia too. And some might say there’s signs of the same in the UK.
Pride is a Freedom March.
A Protest. A Declaration of Power.
Pride is Love In Action.

A Peek Inside The House of Terror — One of Budapest’s Most Notorious and Frightening Museums,https://articlesbypauletteklein.medium.com/a-peek-inside-the-house-of-terror-one-of-budapests-most-notorious-and-frightening-museums-e0249b4156d8,"Sign up

The Terror Museum isn’t your run-of-the-mill macabre haunted house type museum meant to temporarily scare you like a Hollywood movie. Instead, the terrors that took place inside this building are real, carried out by two separate regimes spanning from World War II to the Soviet communist area by their secret police.
The Terror Museum is located on the beautiful Andrassy Utca, one of Budapest’s most elegant boulevards with lush shady trees, stately apartment buildings, and high-end designer boutiques. This upscale bustling area of Budapest also has a dark and storied past. Nestled among the buildings on this posh street is where visitors will find the museum, which is one of Budapest’s most notorious and frightening buildings.
As I approached the entrance to the museum, I was struck with a surreal sensation knowing that this beautiful building was once the headquarters to both the Hungarian Arrow Cross Party (Hungary’s Nazi Party) and AVO/AVH Communist Terrorist Organizations. The building, if not for the iron platform with the words “Terror” adorning its roof, was a beautiful example baroque architecture and the words did little to prepare me for the history of horror that awaited me just beyond the entrance doors.
Before entering the museum I took some time to admire a piece of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain Memorial, a chain sculpture reminding visitors of the city’s dark history during Soviet rule.
The ground floor of the museum consists of the lobby, cafe, cloakroom, restrooms, and ticket counter. After passing through the ticket admission turnstile, I entered a 3-story courtyard that houses a Soviet tank sitting in a reflection pool and a gallery that showcases a haunting display of hundreds of black and white photographs of Hungarians who were the victims of the communist terror organizations.
The museum’s tour began on the 3rd floor where a labyrinth of exhibits guided me through the history of the building’s infamous past; starting with the story of the rise of the Hungarian Nazis (The Arrow Cross Party), the end of the Nazi regime, rise of communism in Hungary, and the resistance. The displays are a fascinating look at how the atrocities of terror organizations impacted the lives of the citizens of Budapest.
After passing through the exhibits of the top floor, the tour descends down a spiral staircase to the 2nd floor. Here I had an opportunity to learn about the history of the AVO/AVH terror organizations and the practices of their secret police. The exhibits feature communist propaganda, the life of people living under communism, the offices of the Gabor Peter, the Head of the Hungarian Political Police, as well as other exhibits to help one understand the terrors the citizens faced during this bleak and dangerous time in history.
From the museum’s second floor, I entered the elevator where the tour’s darkest part was about to take place. Learning about the history of terrors that took place was truly tragic, but what was hidden below in the building’s basement was even more terrifyingly evil.
As I made my way through a through a maze of dungeonous prison cells, interrogation rooms complete with the original torture equipment, execution rooms, and the heart-wrenching Hall of Tears featuring lit crosses in remembrance of the victims whose lives ended here, I was left shaken. Imaging the terror the victims must have felt as they endured days spent subject to horrific torture and worse in these cold grey stone walls was a bit overwhelming, to say the least.
As I exited the tour and stepped back out into the bright daylight and onto Andrassy Utca, my mind was still trying to process the evil that humans can do to one another. It was one of the museums that I wished didn’t exist, but believe must be visited in order to understand that the dark times of history should never be repeated. It was a museum that I will never forget.
The Terror Haus is one of the most powerfully moving museums in Europe and one that needs to be on your Budapest itinerary. The museum is open Tuesday to Sunday, 10:00 am to 6:00 pm and is located at 60 Andrassy Boulevard.

Budapest was such an awesome city! Although not at the very top, it comes a very close second! It is very open and spread out, yet it still had its nooks and crannies to get lost in. The city reminded us of Brooklyn in NY, it had a trendy/hipster feel with a lot of young people. The nightlife was outrageous, with tons of restaurants to eat at and bars to socialize in, for all sorts of tastes. There were parks to lay around in or many shopping streets to keep you busy. There is something for everyone in Budapest… except a beach which is why Barcelona is still our favorite city visited so far.
Budapest has 23 districts and they are usually indicated by Roman numerals. The more central districts, like downtown, have lower numbers while the outer districts have higher numbers. The best districts to stay in are district V and VI as within these 2 districts you can find a lot of the major landmarks & attractions, along with the widest selection of restaurants, cafes, pubs and bars. Most, if not all, are walkable. We barely used the Metro system but it was very easy to navigate when necessary.
There were countless accommodation options in Budapest especially a huge range of hostels. Booking the day before still allowed us over 40+ hostels to choose from. We ended up staying at 11th Hour Hostel and Cinema which was located right in the middle of downtown. Some other popular hostels in a great location are Wombats, Big Fish, Downtown Oasis, Maverick City Lodge.
Szechenyi Baths and Pool — One of the largest spa complexes of its kind in Europe. The entry ticket is (5000 HUF/ 16 €) which includes the usage of a change room, locker, multiple different pools, saunas, steam rooms and fitness centre. We spent a couple of hours here relaxing in the pools & sweating it up in the saunas. Note: bring your own towel & lunch as there isn’t a large selection of food!
Conquer Budapest Walking tour visiting St Stephen Basilica, Matthias Church, Danube Promenade, Chain Bridge, National Opera House, Castle District (Royal Palace, Matthias Church, Fisherman Bastion). Our guide for this was one of our favourites of our Europe trip so far and we’ve done a lot of ‘free walking tours’. The tour was never boring even though we are slowly but surely getting tired of churches and history, he kept it interesting and fun for the whole 3 hours. The Fisherman Bastion is shown below.
Central Market Hall- A 3 story hall combing shopping and eating. Fresh fruit and vegetable stalls, meats, cheeses, souvenirs, shopping and most importantly a selection of food stalls with portions bigger than you can ever imagine. Classic Hungarian dishes are sold here but come hungry and forget trying to count calories.
Vaci Utca — Vaci Utca is one of the main shopping streets in Budapest and also a very popular tourist drag. The street is lined with cute cafes, great shops and a tonne of Thai massage parlours which we indulged in (do shop around).
Margaret Island — A 2.5km long central island laying in between “buda” and “pest”. A very well kept island with ample to do during the summer months. It’s a beautiful spot to spend an afternoon during the spring/summer. The island has a pool, water park, wildlife park & athletic centre. We strolled here from downtown Budapest or you can take the number 26 bus which is the only vehicle allowed on the island.
Gellert Hill — Panoramic views over Budapest. You can climb the Gellért Hill starting at the Elisabeth Bridge near the Gellért Monument, or you can take the steeper route starting at the Gellért Hotel. You can also take a bus or get there by taxi.
Eating in Budapest was a welcomed treat after indulging in so much pasta and pizza in Italy. Hungary had their typical cuisine but also every other type, so there was never too much repeating. It was cheap, the portions were often of a good size and there were countless restaurants to choose from.
Street food is also very common and convenient in Budapest. At Karavan you can find numerous food trucks in this little outdoor area. Perfect for a quick dinner or a late night snack after spending time at the famous ruin bar, Szimpla Kert.
Below is a list of the typical Hungarian dishes you should try if you are to visit the city! And before you finish, don’t be alarmed when we mention that we did eat all of them.. a few times.
You can easily sample all of these on your own throughout the city but if you enjoy food tours then we suggest signing up for one of the many tours Taste Hungary has to offer.
Hungarians typically eat their biggest meal during lunch so many restaurants offer a “Tourist Menu” which involves a three-course meal for less than $6 (100 HUF), this is often cheaper than ordering just one dish. However, when we weren’t eating a 3-course meal, you could find us at some of our other favourite restaurants:
Bors Gasztrobar — Always a line, freshly made baguette sandwiches, homemade soups & cheap cheap!Drum Cafe — Cheap, classic Hungarian food.Fruccola — Healthy, fresh, create your own salads/sandwiches.Magyar — Classic 3 course restaurant with generous portions. Close to the Grand Central Market but surprisingly not a tourist trap as we had first thought.
Just like restaurants, the nightlife options are endless and generally are within walking distance. We weren’t in Budapest over the weekend but each night had something going on.
Some of you may be aware of what a “Ruin Bar” is, some not… well Budapest is famous for these types of bars. It is simply a bar/pub, inside or next to an old building. The buildings have usually been abandoned and turned into bars by decorating them with many different types of objects, such as paper statues, foreign licence plates, unique lanterns and seats made from cushions, old cars, duck tape, you name it. If you use your imagination you can usually get a picture for what they look like. None of the interior makes sense and generally doesn’t have a theme except looking like ‘designed junk’. If the walls aren’t covered with pictures and objects then they are painted.
Some of the most popular Ruin bars in Budapest are Szimpla Kert, Grandio, Instant, Yellow Zebra Bikes & Bar and Anker’T. If you have to go to only one, make it Szimpla Kert! So much fun and so unique. It’s open during the day, so you can get a better look at the interior. Grandio is a hostel as well as a bar so don’t stay here if you’re wanting to sleep!
Gozsdu Courtyard is another popular area in downtown. Although they aren’t ruin bars, the courtyard/long street has a variety of beer gardens and restaurants and is both popular with locals and tourists. Check out Spiler, one of the biggest restaurants in the area with a solid menu both for food and drinks. The lamb burger was super tasty & recommended.
We were really sad to leave Budapest but until next time…..

We exited Szimpla Kert and stepped out into the dark, rustic alleys of Budapest. The fragrant fall air of late October brought hints of change, and this once-ruined city at night gave the impression we were traveling in another world.
While walking the streets in that state of traveler’s bliss, we joked about the twists of fate that had brought the two of us to this place, still buzzing on the beers we had shared in a vintage bathtub in the maze that was the ruin bar we had just left.
As we passed through the alley, a figure moving against the crowd was nonchalantly listing out choice substances to no one in particular, not-so-subtly soliciting interest.
The indulgences of the night had lulled me to let my guard down, and so I thought nothing of her flagging the guy down in the crowded street, and inquiring about the availability of some grass. There were two of us, and just this one man, so what risk was there?
As they conducted a transaction in hushed words, I felt no cause for alarm. My friend was confident in these kinds of situations and…

Budapest is renown for its spas — even the zoo has one, with many animals having their own thermal baths (and, apparently, a very high reproductive rate). On a glorious spring day I stood outside the belle epoch Széchenyi Baths, the phrases ‘taking the waters’ and ‘frequented by royalty’ running through my mind. Even the entrance to the baths was a work of wonder.
Inside was all high ceilings and chandeliers. An authoritarian attendant ushered me into a small change room, returning later to lock my clothes away. I shared my change room with half a dozen others — this was no place for false modesty.
And so, to the waters. Outside were two enormous baths (one at 30 degrees C, the other at 34) with a lap pool between them. Inside were another 15 or so baths, each catering to different needs.

Our complete running guide to Budapest is now on the Great Runs site. Below is a quick summary.
Budapest, Hungary is a wonderful city for traveling, with wonderfully preserved architecture, great restaurants and bars, and a good transport infrastructure. It is the capital of Hungary and the country’s largest city, with a population of 3.3 million. There are lots of great places to go running in Budapest.
The best places to run in Budapest are all centrally located. The highlight is Margaret Island, a recreational mecca with several km of trails with great river and city views. There is also excellent running along the Danube, on both sides, although one should look carefully at our guide to learn the best sections. There are also some great parks for running: City Park (Varosliget), Bikás Park, and Orczy Park. And for some hills, head to Gellért Hill in Buda and run up to the Citudella (fort), or enjoy the more expansive Normafa park, a few km west of the city. One thing that’s unique about running in Budapest is that there are many places with rubberized running tracks, which are dedicated paths for runners. The longest is 5.3 km on Margaret Island. Many of these tracks also feature an open air fitness park, with machines for exercising.
Our full guide to running in Budapest is on the Great Runs site. Click on the links to each of these routes for full description and maps.

December 29, 2024
When you first step into a new city, the vibe tells you a lot. Specially, when you go in without much research, like we did for this one. So, stepping into Budapest after the loud and lively Vienna felt like entering a quieter, more mysterious world. As we climbed up the escalator from the train station, the crisp cold air hit our faces, and the glowing Liberty Bridge appeared in the distance arching over Danube. It was a quiet welcome, and something about it felt right. Calm and inviting — that was our first taste of Budapest.
The walk to our hotel was an easy 10 minutes. Although, in -2°C, dragging suitcases, while our fingers and nose slowly froze, we couldn’t help but admire the streets. That moment, in a way, set the tone for the rest of the trip: embracing the unexpected and finding joy in the little things. My North Face jacket and Alaska-grade boots were doing their job, but Dev, who’s always “too cool for layers,” was clearly questioning his decisions. The streets were quiet, dimly lit, and peaceful — a stark contrast to where we had come from. Tired but content, something about the city felt quietly intriguing.
December 30, 2024
Day 1: When Things Don’t Go as Planned
The next morning, we woke up later than usual. Laundry was the first task of the day — a necessity for anyone packing light on long trips. We tried this for the first time last year during our trip to France and Spain, and it was a game changer. We found a laundromat nearby and got our oat milk lattes while waiting for the cycles to finish. It was a slow start, but it felt good to take our time. Given our type A personalities of always being on the go — Dev, especially — and me being a mix of high-energy and sometimes slowing down, we’ve both been trying to deliberately pace ourselves. This trip somehow made it easier, as if the city’s vibe gently nudged us to slow down and be present. It even tied into my New Year’s resolution. How? I am not going to spoil it for you! You’ll find out towards the end.
Then came breakfast — or rather, the search for it. Most places were closed for the holidays, and Google’s “open now” wasn’t exactly reliable. Isn’t it funny how we still trust Google blindly, even after so many travel time fails? No? Just us? Anyway, we ended up wandering aimlessly for what felt like forever, hangry. Finally, we stumbled upon Napfényes Restaurant and Confectionery, a vegan Hungarian spot. We had vegan versions of authentic Hungarian food, including vegan goulash. The desserts were the real winners: a sponge cake that reminded me of tiramisu and soy yogurt “cottage cheese” balls. We devoured it! When sharing dessert somehow we eat faster! No? Again, Just us?! 😲
We enjoyed a long brunch and by the time we were done it was already noon, so with no specific plans for the day, we decided to just walk along the Danube. The river stretched out, with the Buda Castle standing tall in the backdrop— it was mesmerizing.
While I posed at multiple locations by the river and Dev happily played photographer, a guy proposed to his girlfriend right next to us. I was so in the moment that I missed their moment and realized it when I saw people congratulating them. (You’ll see the exact moment I finally saw it in the picture below) I was so bummed that I missed it, but it also made us feel so warm and happy to see the happy couple! Also, I didn’t forget the usual:
Me: “You never proposed to me like that.”
Dev: “I’ve been on my knees ever since.”
Dude’s got lines!
The foggy walk along the river was really romantic, which explains the proposal as well. It’s an amazing spot to propose — if that’s something you’re considering. Notice the bench, that’s where you can pretend to take a picture from behind while the other person faces the river. Perfect moment to get on your knees. Good luck!
I took this picture of Dev on that same spot before the proposal happened.
As we moved along, we saw a street vendor mulling wine on the side of the road. Unlike the machine-made ones in Vienna, this one was simmering on a stove. We grabbed some, and Dev downed his so fast he claimed, “Fefde jal gaye” (burnt my insides). But it warmed us up perfectly for the evening.
Continuing our walk, we came across the Jewish Memorial — iron shoes lined up along the riverbank. These shoes commemorate the Jews tragically executed during World War II at this very spot. It’s a haunting and humbling reminder of history’s darker moments.
Hungarian Parliament
From there, we turned right and saw it — the Hungarian Parliament — a jaw-dropping masterpiece of architecture. It’s one of the most stunning buildings we’ve ever seen! I had heard it’s even better from the inside, but we didn’t have tickets, and it was sold out due to holidays on that day. So we happily admired the exteriors of this exquisite detailed gothic and renaissance gem! Of course, this meant photos galore. Dev quipped, “Seriously, itni photos li hain ki Parliament Sharma gaya!” (We clicked so many pictures that the Parliament itself got shy!)
After all that, we decided to take a coffee break but we realized we were completely coffee-d out! So, I ordered water — because, fun fact, Europe and dehydration seem to go hand in hand for me. Unless I’m super intentional about drinking water, I always end up forgetting to hydrate. Quick tip: Make sure you sip a lot of water while traveling! Over Dev’s chai latte with oat milk, water, some vegan Lindt chocolate, and some more geeking out over architecture history, we enjoyed the lit up view of the parliament. Dev after over 10 years of being married to an architect is pretty caught up with his architectural history!
Honestly, these little pauses are becoming some of our favorite moments. ❤️
Evening Adventures: Ruin Bars and New Friends
After that, wondering what to do next, we decided to explore a street nearby called Andrassy Ut. After walking that street, we found a small vegan restaurant tucked in a basement. At first glance, we were hesitant, but the cozy, homely vibe inside won us over. The place was run by a mother-daughter duo, with the mother cooking in an open kitchen and the daughter managing everything else. I tried vegan cottage cheese pasta, while Dev had a burger. They were out of their vegan Hungarian goulash, much to my disappointment. After enjoying our meal, we left chatting and laughing, only to realize ten minutes later that our handbag was missing! Dev sprinted back to the restaurant and thankfully , we retrieved it without issue and after some deliberation decided to head to the Jewish Ruin Bars, a must-visit in Budapest. These bars, created in abandoned Jewish factories post-World War II, are now vibrant spots of nightlife. There, we ran into an Indian couple living in the UK and had such a great time talking that we completely lost track of time. By 11 PM — a late night for us — we realized how much fun we’d had and how unexpectedly we ended up celebrating what felt like an early New Year’s Eve with newfound friends. Moments like these truly make travel special!
December 31, 2024
Day 2: Lost and Found on Gellért Hill
We started our day nice and slow, waking up around 10 AM. After getting ready, we headed to Buda for the first time, curious to see what it was all about. Our main stop? The St. Gerard Sagredo Statue on Gellért Hill. Now, this place has quite a story — turns out St. Gerard was a priest who was thrown off the hill for his beliefs. Pretty tragic, but hey, now he’s got this massive statue and a hill named after him. Goes to show, if you stay true to yourself, you can leave a lasting mark on the world. The views from up there? Totally worth the climb. The winding roads to get there — foggy and lined with leafless dark trees — felt straight out of a movie.
From the statue, I got it into my head that we needed to explore more of the hill. I wanted to see the Liberty Statue, Hungary’s version of the Statue of Liberty, perched somewhere higher up in the mountain. So, off we went, walking past fancy mansions and more winding roads. We somehow found ourselves passing the Saudi Arabia Embassy and even saw a mansion that had once belonged to a wealthy family but was sold due to tragedy and is now a museum, I think. It felt like a little adventure in our quest to find the Liberty Statue. Maybe it was the fog, or maybe it was the construction happening around the castle at the top, but we didn’t find the statue.
Eventually, what we did find, was a cozy café called Füge Shop and Café. We sat down, sipped hot coffee, and just chilled for a bit!
As the evening rolled in, we crossed the bridge from Buda back to Pest for our boat tour on the Danube. If you want to see Budapest in all its glory, this is the way to do it. The Parliament and Buda Castle lit up at night? Stunning. If I may get poetic — the Parliament glowed like a golden crown against the night sky, its reflection shimmering in the Danube — a sight to remember. Nothing could stop us from stepping out of the heated seating area onto the deck for better views, and wow, it was worth it. A flock of shadowy black birds danced against the Parliament’s glowing backdrop, the chill of the air felt nice, and the Danube looked majestic as ever. It was one of those quiet, perfect moments for Dev and me, just soaking it all in. Oh, and let’s not forget the Spanish group of revelers who at that moment asked me to take their group shot. I obliged, and my iPhone .5 shot skills made them so happy! It was all happening.
After the hour-long tour, we walked back to our hotel for a quiet New Year’s Eve. Leftovers, packaged dal from Costco (warmed up by the hotel staff, pro move, right? Which the hotel manager noticed and told us, Hungarian tradition says if you eat lentils on new years eve you will have immense wealth the next year, well, we’ll take that!) some snacks, a complimentary bottle of wine from the hotel, video calls with family, some Bollywood party music, a little dancing, and just enjoying each other’s company.
New Years Day — Jan 01, 2025
Day 3: Vampires, Witches, and Spooky Stories
Waking up on the first of January, the first thing that popped into my head was my New Year’s resolution: spend less time on social media. Over the past year, I’d realized I’d developed a bit of an addiction to scrolling. Sure, I love sharing travel pictures for many reasons, but it started to feel counterproductive. (We’ll save that discussion for another day!) So, before I slept on New Year’s Eve, I boldly deleted my Instagram app.
Fast forward to the next morning — I woke up feeling good but immediately wanted to reinstall the app. Classic, right? But guess what? The universe was on my side because I couldn’t log back in! Logging in from Budapest locked me out, and I didn’t remember my password. Taking this as a sign from the stars, I decided to roll with it.
I shared this with Dev over breakfast, and he confessed he could also do with less Reddit and LinkedIn time. Boom — joint New Year’s resolution made! Feeling all kinds of inspired, we got ready and stepped out into a cloudy, rainy Budapest winter.
Eating out on New Year’s Day is tricky. Most places are closed, and the ones that are open are usually packed. Our first stop was a café, but the only vegan option was, literally, a freezing spirulina beach bowl. So we moved on. Eventually, we stumbled upon a fancy Michelin-starred restaurant. It wasn’t entirely vegan, but hey, it sounded like a New Year’s treat. And it was super fancy — the server unfolded my napkin and placed it on my lap. Not the most comfortable I’ve been in a moment!
I ordered a delicious spinach salad with tofu, while Dev went for an acai bowl and fries (the only other vegan options). Oh, and the breads were vegan and delicious. The food was top-notch, and we felt fancy AF starting our year like this. Again, not planned at all!
Next up was Buda Castle, sitting pretty on a hill. Armed with layers of clothing and our enthusiasm, we started the climb — stairs and all. The view from the top was stunning, but man, it was freezing!
Once we reached the castle, we saw massive lines for the museum and ticket counters. After a quick debate, we decided to skip the museum. Why? Because we wanted to be more intentional with our time. Instead of rushing through, we chose to go back to our hotel, relax, and recharge for our evening plans. So unlike us, right? I think it’s all about fighting the FOMO!
Back at the hotel, we couldn’t distract ourselves with our phones (thanks to the new resolution), so we turned on the TV. To our delight, there was an orchestra performance playing — it felt oddly perfect for the day. We snacked on leftovers, took a quick nap, and felt recharged for the evening.
Our evening began with street food (yes, pav bhaji in Budapest!) before heading out for our walking tour. We took a quick stroll around the winter market and the giant Ferris wheel, which had completely baffled me earlier. The blue glow it cast on the sky behind the buildings had left me wondering where it was coming from — until I finally saw the Ferris wheel and it all made sense.
Eastern Europe has a rich history of eerie tales, and this walking tour was a deep dive into them. We learned about Vlad the Impaler, the Romanian ruler who gruesomely killed his enemies. Vlad was later captured by a Hungarian emperor and imprisoned under Buda Castle. This gruesome history inspired the vampire legends we know today, including Dracula!
The craziest part? As our tour guide was dramatically recounting this story, a bystander — Romanian, of course — who was not at all happy about the story, interrupted to say Vlad wasn’t that bad. Who’s to say? Maybe we’ll have to visit Romania to find out. New trip idea alert?
Then there was the story of the Crying Widow, a woman who allegedly ran a hospital in her basement but used the blood of young girls to maintain her beauty. Oh, and another witch apparently ate children straight out of their graves. 😱. By the end of the tour, we were thoroughly spooked — especially since we had to walk down the castle hill alone.
We grabbed a cab back to the hotel that was 5 minute drive away. Not because it was late at night and we were spooked, duh!, only because we had an early start the next day. 😅
That night, we packed up and got ready for our early morning train to Bratislava.
Final Thoughts
Budapest wasn’t what we expected, because we didn’t really know what to expect. It was better. From wandering aimlessly to stumbling upon cozy cafés, and from Gothic architecture debates to spooky vampire tales, every unplanned moment added a layer to our journey. It reminded us that sometimes, letting go of plans is the best way to truly experience a place. The unplanned moments — getting lost, discovering hidden gems, and letting go of rigid plans — made it unforgettable. Sometimes, the best travel stories aren’t the ones you plan. They’re the ones that find you.

I created a video about Budapest, Hungary’s capital, for the “Connecting cities” project. I took these photos while I was with the Erasmus program there, and I wanted to share with you my once in a lifetime experience! Enjoy! #connectingCities
Last year I was given the opportunity to participate in the Erasmus program. The city I was chosen to go was Budapest. As a student there I made a lot of friends, with most of them coming from other countries and cultures. As you can imagine, I broadened my horizons, I shifted my perspective about a variety of things and, as a result, I changed a lot about my way of thinking. My stay abroad was for one academic semester (about 6 months), where I was a student at Karoli Gaspar University! In particular, Erasmus is actually an exchange program between European Universities, in which students from European countries connect, collaborate and share their feelings and ideas with each other, while studying in a foreign country. In this way, students become more open-minded and self-confident.
Now, its time for me to show you some of the main attractions that Budapest is famous for, including what I felt and what I thought while being there. Also, I will try to make a comparison of these attractions to the Greek culture and natural heritage, trying to find out the similarities between these two ostensibly different countries, Hungary and Greece.
To begin with, one of the most famous attractions in Budapest, and Hungary in general, is the Danube river. While gazing the Danube river and its calm waves, I surely admired the serenity and the beauty of Hungary’s nature. It is such a nice place, where there are a lot of small kiosks, coffee shops and restaurants, in which you can enjoy this breathtaking landscape and view. It is definitely a place where even your deepest thoughts can be unfolded. Once, while I was drinking my cup of hot chocolate during a boat cruise through the river, it felt like I was in a sailing boat into the Aegean sea. Instantly, the lyrics of Randy Newman’s song came across my mind… ‘’I am looking at the river but I am thinking of the sea’’. Many feelings passed through me and along with this, the sense of nostalgia of the sea and my country made me feel that I am into the Aegean again.
It is said that one of the best known attractions of Budapest is “The Fisherman’s Bastion”, which was built in the 19th century. The Bastion is a castle named after the guild of fishermen that was responsible for defending the stretch of the city walls in the Middle Ages. At this time, it is a city viewing terrace, with a lot of stairs and walking paths, and serves the best panoramic view in Budapest! It is a spot that many tourists visit, in order to take amazing photos of the view and, of course, themselves, for remembering their holidays! Needless to say, the architectural style and placement of the castle makes you feel like you are a part of a fairy tale, by taking you back in time, especially in the wintertime.
When I started finding out more about the city, I discovered that, not only the close to Danube side of Budapest is amazing, but also the other districts both Buda and Pest. For example, there is an enormous square called ‘’Heroes square’’ in which huge buildings and monuments are exhibited. I recall that a guide was telling us once the detailed history of the square, and we were all amazed about how similar the Greek and Hungarian architecture was. For instance, the Museum’s of Fine Arts designers were inspired by the ancient temples of Greece, and that’s why the front of the building is classical with massive Corinthian columns. Apart from that, its exhibitions contain pieces of art from Ancient Greece and Rome, which is something that made me feel really proud.
In my opinion, Budapest is definitely a suitable place for traveling, but only someone who lives there can ascertain how the everyday life and behavior of its local citizens is. As a student there, sometimes I had reservations about some specific things, such as not being accompanied while walking home. But that’s an apprehension I would have in any city that I am not familiar with. In general, Budapest is considered an overcrowded city and people there are kind-hearten and open-minded, such as many Greeks are.
If you go to the city center of Budapest during the Christmas time, you will find small wooden houses selling traditional Hungarian, sweets, food and art, and everything smells cinnamon and coconut. Its typically called the “Christmas Market” and you will surely have a blast while being there!
While spending 6 months there, I tried to taste all kinds of different traditional Hungarian food. My main conclusion was that their recipes were similar with the Greek ones, but Hungarians use more spices and bigger amounts of garlic and onion. As an example to the above, both Hungary and Greece have a traditional recipe for stuffed peppers. In Greece this recipe is called ‘’Gemista’’, and apart from peppers, stuffed tomatoes and other vegetables may also be included. In Hungary, its called ‘’Töltött paprika’’ and, by default, there are only stuffed peppers included. In Greece, “Gemista” is stuffed with minced meat, rice, garlic, tomato sauce, onions and oil olive while in Hungary, it is stuffed with pork, rice, onion, garlic, paprika and tomato sauce. So, you can imagine how similar these recipes are to each other, despite the small differences that may occur.
Additionally, I need to write about the baroque style that characterizes Budapest. While walking around the city, the roads and the buildings make you feel like you are starring in a mystery movie! Most of European countries are conducted with this architectural style, which is why they are considered to be so “unique” and “special” compared to other countries. In Budapest, you will notice these buildings of Baroque architecture mainly in the castle district, but also in the Szechenyi Thermal baths, the Royal palace and St. Anna’s Church. This style makes the city an absolute architectural paradise!
Now days, there is a situation which many countries are facing, mainly due to the financial crisis that hit the European Union. Unfortunately, in both Budapest and Athens, are a lot of homeless people and their number is constantly being increased. Most of them are living in subway stations, underpasses, parks and areas with high criminality rates. A high percentage of them are drug addicts and alcoholics. The problem in both Budapest and Athens is that there aren’t enough shelters that can provide a descent place to live to those who can’t afford it. So, inevitably, they end up living in the streets. For example, as a solution to this unfortunate situation, the City Hall of Athens is planning to open an overnight shelter for the capital’s homeless, but this kind of plan needs a lot of effort and time to be invested in order to be successful soon enough.In conclusion, we realize that these two cities, Budapest and Athens, have come to deal with poverty due to all the problems caused by the financial crisis. As a case in point, the high level of unemployment was a fatal factor for the loss of many homes, which led to the increased number of homeless people all around the county.
If you are a new Erasmus student, don’t worry, you will quickly make a lot new friends from a bunch of different countries! Erasmus students are very friendly and open to new friendships and experiences. I remember the very first course where we got to meet each other. That course was the Hungarian language one, and my first thought about it was that the difficulty was pretty much the same as the Greek one. All the Erasmus students were joking about the difficulty of the language, and how we could cope with it. We couldn’t even pronounce the words in the right way! It’s really hard to speak Hungarian fluently…
Fortunately, 6 months are enough to find out a lot of hints about living in Budapest, and of course to get along with them too. I have to admit that I am really glad about choosing Budapest as my Erasmus destination. I gained a lot of experiences, felt a lot of emotions and I had the chance to bond with so many people from around the world! I strongly believe that if it wasn’t for Budapest, I wouldn’t be able to understand how much my country relates or differentiates with another one, or how identical or opposite it can be in various aspects! I would definitely not change a thing!

Yes, for sure!!
Budapest is one of the most beautiful, vibrant, and dynamic cities in the country of Hungary. It is the combination of two regions i.e., Buda — A hilly area, and Pest — A flat area, divided by the Danube River in centre.
The Hungarian capital has extremely exceptional sights on both banks of the Danube, a history of over 2000 years, vivid culture, and appetizing delicacies.
Everything you MUST know about the experiences here is as below:
This is one of the most architecturally spectacular and sacred buildings in the city located in the Pest region.
The St. Stephen Square in front of the basilica will give you a whole different feeling during the winters and summers as it comprises of Christmas market and terraces with parasols respectively.
The Basilica consists of a beautifully ornamented interior with statues, mosaics, murals, paintings, and stained glass which will surely amaze you about its history.

“Is it Paris or is it communist Russia? Who knows?!” Colin Hanks
These days, thanks to lower wages and a lower cost of living — and studio heads’ need for more money — there’s a lot of Hollywood production in Hungary. On any given night, some celebrity or muckety-muck can be found sipping palinka at the Four Seasons Hotel bar or wandering along the Danube. I’m here because my husband is working on a television show, our apartment’s Apple TV still has Eddie Redmayne’s login info and I know what Colin Hanks said about Budapest because my friend ran into him here, he was nice, they chatted, he described this place perfectly.
The comparison to Paris is obvious: classic pre-war buildings on either side of a glorious river spanned by majestic bridges. Communism lingers in the depressing grey concrete buildings shoved between old elegant ones and the unsmiling faces seen on the street.
But when I heard this quote, my first thought wasn’t architecture or national character, it was bread. Budapest’s bread and pastries are — for real — better than bread and pastries in Paris.
I swear. But just in case my taste buds or memory had gone awry, I went to Paris to test my hypothesis. Any excuse to mow down more flour, sugar and butter than any…

Will: We arrived in Budapest extremely hungry (see what I did there?). After disembarking from another lovely Flixbus trip, it was time to find our next home away from home.
Our Air BnB is in a popular area of the city called Oktogon. It’s a lively section of town full of restaurants, bars, shops, hotels, and grocery stores. We had no issues checking into our Air Bnb, and after a brief respite, it was time for dinner. Using our trusty dusty Happy Cow app we found a Mediterranean restaurant cheffing up some amazing salad bowls. Tucked in the Jewish Quarter, the owners welcomed us with big smiles and loaded us up with some felafel balls atop a bed of quinoa, salad greens, beats, and hummus. Post dinner we considered joining the masses in having a few drinks, but the travel day wore us out more than we anticipated. No need to rush it — we’ll be here all month!
Sunday was a settling-in type of day, and we had a mission.
Acquainting yourself with a brand-new city is fun in many ways; we’re learning to see its joy instead of overwhelming ourselves. Google Maps has become our best friend, and finding the most informative local blogs online has become a refined skill.
It might not seem like a real skill, but there are plenty of opportunities to be led astray when relying on the internet.
Carolina: As I'm writing this 22 days after ""moving"" to Budapest, I forget exactly the order of happenings for this day. But, as Will mentioned, we had some missions for Sunday.
For groceries, we gravitated towards Spar since that's the grocery chain we grew accustomed to in Zagreb. However, the Spar location near us wasn't the greatest — the quality of the veggies and variety was subpar, same could be said for their selection of vegan proteins, coffee, milk, and pasta. In the coming days we discovered that just across the street, there was a small local grocery chain (G Roby) that had everything we needed and more.
For the gym, we decided to tour a few spots. First, Nr1 Fitness — a 24/7 gym inside of what seemed to be an office building. As we walked in, we encountered a receptionist who, in broken English, told us that the gym was independent of the offices so she didn't have access to it. We decided to go check it out anyway behind the glass doors. As we did, two gym members came into the building and as they unlocked the doors to the gym, we slipped in with them.
The gym was small but not busy. It was a bit warm but it had everything we were looking for — ""It will be a good sweat session, kind of like hot yoga"" we told each other.
We then walked to 4% Fitness Corner — which is exactly what you would expect from a Budapest gym. House music booming through the speakers, cage-like room dividers, and muscle tees everywhere. It was only $10 extra than the other gym but there was more space, more machines, and the AC worked.
After touring the gyms, we decided to grab lunch and weigh our options. We walked to Kozmosz, an underground restaurant that serves vegan versions of traditional Hungarian dishes. Over chocolate-covered layered cake and coffee, we re-read the reviews for Nr1 and 4% and found out that many people had a hard time canceling their membership with Nr1, asking for a cancelation, still being charged, and not being able to get their money back. Now that's a problem we don't want to have. As we had discovered from our tours, 4% accepted cash payments. Additionally, there were no complaints of scammy business practices.
On the following day, we showed up at 4% and paid a month's worth of cash membership. And just like that, we had a gym.
Will: But what about when you’re suffering from screen fatigue? What is a way to explore a city without a phone? Caro and I have found going for a run works brilliantly.
Carolina: Going on casual runs has to be one of my favorite ways to explore somewhere. I say ""casual"" because the main objective of these runs isn't to hit a specific distance or keep at a certain pace. The objective is to go somewhere you've never been and see new things. To take the the byway just to see what it leads to. In these runs, it's more than okay to stop to take in the scenery, as the objective isn't to run.
That's how we decided to spend our first Sunday evening in Budapest. We ran up the street that connects Oktogon to the Budapest City Park — Andrássy út. Passing by gorgeous buildings such as HAB (Hungarian Art and Business), and the Alice Hotel. To reach the park, we ran around Hero's Square where we got a gorgeous view of the sunset (see picture below).
At the park, we ran aimlessly, allowing ourselves to get lost in the network of trails and pathways that cut through the park. At some point, we found ourselves at a Wine & Food festival (typical) in the shadows of the Vajdahunyad Castle. We also explored the park's extensive recreational sports infrastructures, and of course, the Széchenyi Thermal Bath.
On our way back, passing through the Hero's Square once again, we came across a Star Wars meet-up, over 200 people holding blue and red lightsabers. It was truly a sight to be seen.
Arriving back at Oktogon, we were lured into a local Pizza chain by the smell of baked dough, tomato sauce, and cheese. To my content, they had a veggie pizza option with no cheese. So we wrapped up another wholesome day with 2 slices of cheese-less pizza.

We arrived in Budapest after traveling for twenty-two hours. We were tired.
My husband and I were new to river cruising and decided to get our feet wet with what some call the grand-daddy of Viking cruises — The Grand European Tour.
This cruise would take us from Budapest to Amsterdam over two weeks on the Danube, Main, and Rhine Rivers through the heart of Europe. We had no idea what to expect on our first night.
Before dinner, I asked if my husband could walk through Budapest with me across the famous Chain Bridge. I knew he was tired, but for me — he said yes. I had explained that we’d be departing the next evening before the city was lit and I wanted to get some photographs.
I’m blessed with an adoring and amenable husband. He knows one of my life’s greatest pleasures is taking photographs—especially on a trip.
When we left the ship, we weren’t ready for the beauty of Budapest at night. This walk over the Chain Bridge from Pest to Buda, on that first night, is one of my favorite and most beautiful parts of our European river cruise vacation.

Few days after I came back from Trieste, I had lined up another trip, and this type it was sort of a vacation. Except that it wasn’t, since it was a summer school with a full 9–5 schedule and all that. But it was summer and I was going to be there for a week, so for me it was like taking a vacation trip!
This was my second time in Budapest, since I visited the city previously in 2016, but back then it was November and pretty cold, so I didn’t get to fully experience the city, the agenda was packed so I only got to see a little bit from the night life, which had intrigued me and I knew that sooner or later I would return to finish the job.
Also one big difference since the previous trip was that now I was staying at Pest — the bohemian part of the city, while the first time I was situated at Buda — the part with the hills and castles.
I got a really cheap flight from Skopje, like 40 Euros a round trip, which was a great deal considering that the first time I had to take THREE flights just to get to Budapest and additional two on the way back.
As soon as I got to my accommodation, the Ludovika Kampus Dormitory — which was fairly easy to find, I met my roommates, Pranav from Nepal and Yahya from Pakistan.
Since our dinner was scheduled for later that evening, we went to have coffee in the centre and to do some sightseeing. Some places were familiar to me, the St. Stephen Basilica and the famous Hungarian Parliament (which amazes me every time I see it).
Since Pranav and Yahya hadn’t been to the city before I showed them some of sights that I knew, the weather was great so we took a walk and after that we had some coffee. Soon it was time to go back and to prepare for the dinner where would meet that rest of the participants at the summer school.
The organizers had also provided us with public transport tickets for the whole week, so this was particularly useful since we could use whatever we like — the subway, trams, buses, even ferries!
Soon we met up with the rest of the participants, so there I’d meet the people with who I would spent the next week — Bernat from Catalunya, Silva from Italy, Leonie and Nina from Germany, fellow Balkanian Stere from Romania, Heidi from US/Netherlands, Celine from China, my great friend Vassiliki from Greece, Zuhair from Iraqi Kurdistan and many more.
During the next few days we got to hear some interesting lecture on populism and it’s rapid rise in Europe — but I also got to learn that it wasn’t just a problem that the EU is dealing with, but that the struggle is real for other parts in the world as well.
At that time the situation was also beginning to become complicated in Catalunya and Iraqi Kurdistan — so it was great to share some opinions and discuss the matter.
It was quite nice that we were in Hungary and discussing this topic — since we all know about Viktor Orban and his policy towards refugees. This added another dimension to the discussions and we heard some interesting points, coming from the Hungarian side, or at least some Hungarian experts that took part as lecturers.
So the next five days during the days we we’re discussing and researching this topics, while at nights we were discovering Budapest’s amazing nightlife! One of my favorite things from the Budapest nightlife is the vast number of ruin pubs throughout the city, and during that week we probably got to see like close to 10 different ruin pubs.
The first night we went to my favorite spot, the one that I visited three nights in a row during my last trip — Szimpla Kert! So basically this is like bar, that is set in a garden (or maybe the garden is set inside of a bar) and it has all kind of cool stuff — like old phones, chairs, chandeliers, video arcades — the place has everything, plus some quality drinks and it’s packed with tourists!
The first night we went there with Heidi and Stere, while most of the others were already tired, but the next night we also went to this place and had a great time!
However, during the next few days we got to some see different places and what I can say is that we weren’t disappoint! Budapest has so many ruin pubs to offer, so I’d definitely recommend that if you go there, go to Szimpla Kert for a while, and then visit some other places as well!
So one night we went to this place Golya Presso — also a ruin pub but much smaller than Szimpla but quite similar in a way. A Hungarian friend of mine, Zoltan, told me before that this place was sort of a hub for the leftists, and it definitely had that kind of atmosphere — especially it’s enterier.
Another night we went to this Red Ruin — by the name you can guess what kind place of it was –filled up communist memorabilia and Stalin, Mao, Lenin etc caricatures on the walls.
Has some beer and some palinka there — I have to admit that I could managed to drink just one shot of palinka, since in my opinion it was terrible — rakija is way better than that! We met some crazy drunk people there — one of them was a drunk barking man who scared couple of dogs that were inside the pub (sounds weird but it happened).
One more place that left a good impression on me was this ruin pub called Ankerts, where they had some great draft beer, good music and atmosphere, but unfortunately we didn’t stay there for too long.
During the day, beside the lectures, once or twice we also went around the city, on the Danube bank and it was pretty awesome to watch the sunset there and to have some drinks.
I love this city since it has it all — great architecture with a lot of history, awesome nightlife and good public transport — which means that you can truly get a great experience!
But I’d recommend going there during spring or summer, winter is not really friendly if you want to go and do some sightseeing. Budapest is especially breathtaking at night, with it’s shining lights — the Parliament building is just marvelous at night! The bridges on the Danube are quite the gem too, especially Szechenyi bridge!
I didn’t go to the Buda part this time, since most of the days we had activities and always stayed on the Pest side, which was full of nice surprises on every corner.
On the last day before we departed, actually it was our free day, we took a ferry on the Danube and visited the little riverside town of Szentendre,or as Lilit from Armenia would describe — a Serbian-style art town!
Beautiful small city with a big Serbian minority there and signs around the place that I could actually read — since they were written in cyrilics.
We had great lunch there — gulash inside a bread dish (I guess I can call it like this). We had gulash multiple times that week and other than that I can also remember eating one dessert that was really to die for — called Samloi Galushka.
The rest of the food we had was mostly international — we ate pasta, hummus, pizza, etc.
I guess that it actually was a vacation, beside all of the lectures and discussions, so during that week in Budapest I had fun, met some amazing people again, and learned a lot of new and cool stuff. The last day I had my flight in the morning, so basically it was time to go back to reality once again.

I know this is a blog about photography, but it’s also a blog about the way that we create and interpret imagery. I find Wes Anderson’s films a perfect focal point for this discussion about image, storytelling, and framing. Both because of what people seem to inherently understand about Anderson’s unique aesthetic, and also because of what people regularly misrepresent or ignore.
I’m not going to introduce Wes Anderson because if you’re reading this, you know his films. We all have our favourites- often the films which got us started with his 50s toned, highly symmetrical movies (mine is Rushmore). Today I’ll be talking about 2014’s The Grand Budapest Hotel and later about 2021’s The French Dispatch, because these films present (to me) a progression of Anderson’s use of the cinematic frame as a storytelling device.
Note on history of format and aspect ratio
35mm motion picture film- that is, the film itself- wasn’t a particularly revelatory technology. Industrial processing for 70mm photographic roll film was already established, and filmmaker WK Dickson found that by splitting the roll in half you got two 35mm rolls which were ample enough to capture the image rendered by lenses of the time.
Like many stories in early film history, Thomas Edison stuck his head in, forcing Dickson to spend the next five years attempting in vain to establish a new standard. But in the end and to this day, the economics of 35mm film have kept it as the standard, first capitalising on 70mm film industrialization, and later on its own mass production before any other format had the chance to get off the ground.
Traditional spherical lenses project a circular image. We cut the sides off for convenience and to avoid the outside edges of the image circle, which tend to be blurry. The most judicious use of the image circle (beyond simply leaving it circular) is to square it, which remains the standard in some large format photography. This square is, however, at odds with human perception. Every person experiences vision differently, but with two round eyes spaced apart, we can fairly assume that most people see the world significantly wider than square, and the history of aspect ratio is the economics and technology of rendering a cinematic image that better resembles our own eyes.
Early widescreen was limited by lens and film fidelity. You can only cut so far into your image before degrading the quality, widescreen had some success in using larger format 70mm film, but the most common ratios sat around 4:3. A slightly wider square, which was codified as the Academy Ratio after sound was added to movies.
The 4:3 academy frame was wider than square, without significantly reducing the amount of film (and ergo fidelity) used by each frame. Throughout the 1930s and 40s the Great Depression cut into discretionary spending, 70mm film was considered too expensive to use, and further widescreen advances lay dormant.
By the 1950s, the mainstream adoption of television forced filmmakers to innovate. Widescreen implementations which were as simple as changing the matte in a projector were only possible by letterboxing already small tv screens.
In 1952, 20th Century Fox bought rights to a military technology which allowed for wide angle viewing from inside tanks via oval lenses, and coming out with The Robe a year later– the first film shot in ‘scope’ format. Anamorphic lenses squeeze the image on the way into the film plane, allowing twice as much width to fit into a piece of film. The image is in turn desqueezed by the projector, turning a 4:3 frame of 35mm film into a 1:2.9 image. In 1954 Vistavision was established as a more economical way to widen screens, flipping 35mm negative sideways to give an aspect of 1:1.5 which could be further cropped to 1:2 and the modern television standard 1:1.85 (16:9).
Aspect Ratio in The Grand Budapest Hotel
The Grand Budapest Hotel is a nesting doll of narratives. We open to the shrine of a dead author, a visitor holds a book (The Grand Budapest Hotel), and turns to the author’s picture on the back cover. We match cut to the author in an office in 1985, the author tells us about the way stories fall into your lap once the world knows your an author. The aspect ratio changes to 1:1.85 (16:9).
The film is going to pull this menouvre on us often, and it’s keen to make us aware that multiple threads of storytelling are going to take place. It also wants us to know that these stories are being buffed a little with a polish of nostalgic recollection. When our author calls the hotel, “a picturesque, elaborate and once widely celebrated establishment” we cut again to 4:3, and a bright pink hotel reveals itself against an obvious matte painting and a foreground of dimensionless buildings. This part of the story, the filmmaking insists, is literally flattened by layers of recollection as the author character declares, “The incidents that follow were described to me exactly as I present them here, and in a wholly unexpected way.”
Through the remainder of Grand Budapest the moving frame lines serve to remind us not only that there are multiple timelines, but that each timeline is filtered through its own series of storytellers. Wes Anderson’s visuals get flack for being so easily identifiable, but they have an in-text justification in Grand Budapest, where the further removed our author gets from the action, the more the world takes on qualities of the fanciful and make-believe.
Throughout the film, danger is framed by windows- the Zubrowkan army enter the film via a train window, they are spied through a window in the hotel, and Dmitri’s henchman Joplin pursues Deputy Kovacs, first visible through a bus window: Danger abounds, but the existential threat of war seems almost out of scope with the limitations of the story. In the scene of Gustave’s death the frame is robbed of its intense colour, too raw still for Zero the storyteller (Agatha’s death is given no screen time, only narration over imagery of their wedding.)
Why?
So the movie is a nesting doll of different narratives which get progressively distorted through storytelling. It’s a study in the stories we tell, the people and places, we remember, and how we remember them. But also. Why?
Why 4:3 (1.375:1 for pedants), 1.85:1, and 2.35:1? Each time period in the film lines up with the mainstream adoption of that aspect ratio, and so the changing aspect ratios can be considered another part of the set design, which changes dramatically from timeline to timeline. As the browning halls of the 1968 Hotel are rendered in brilliant pinks and reds when we flash back to 1932, so too does the ceiling of the cinematic frame literally grow taller. The perspective literally grows wider and- perhaps- more nuanced- with the historical perspective. Does the film suggest that we’re so far removed from the 30s that what we can perceive is literally cut off on the sides? It’s for you to decide.
It may seem quite contrived to suggest that the narrowing aspect ratio represents a neglecting of the edges of our historical perception, but evidence for this can be found in the text. Our dual protagonists, Zero and Gustave, are a refugee and a bisexual, respectively. Theirs are stories which have been sidelined throughout history, and positioning them in this historical context- even in what remains a comedic romp for most of its runtime. Asks us as audience to consider what stories and characters like Zero and Gustave have been sidelined.
Wes Anderson’s movies draw attention to their own filmmaking to the point of easy categorisation and parody. But too often I believe people categorise as an easy out from analysis.
The estrangement effect has roots in Chinese theatre and Russian Formalism, but was codified into Western theatre by Bertolt Brecht. Brecht’s aim for the estrangement effect (verfremdungseffekt) was that breaking the illusion, and reminding the audience that they were viewing a piece of fiction would force them to engage with the underlying politics. Wikipedia’s description is quite elegant:
“By disclosing and making obvious the manipulative contrivances and “fictive” qualities of the medium, the actors attempt to alienate the viewer from any passive acceptance and enjoyment of the play as mere “entertainment”. Instead, the goal is to force viewers into a critical, analytical frame of mind that serves to disabuse them of the notion that what they are watching is necessarily an inviolable, self-contained narrative. This effect of making the familiar strange serves a didactic function insofar as it aims to teach the viewer not to take the style and content for granted, since (proponents argue) the theatrical medium itself is highly constructed and contingent upon many cultural and economic conditions.”
“Disclosing and making obvious the manipulative contrivances” may not be Wes Anderson’s obvious aim, but the fact that his films are so readily categorised and broken down may at least hint that the estrangement effect is in place. And what are the politics of The Grand Budapest Hotel? It concerns two fringe identities in the face of encroaching fascism.
It is in this way that Grand Budapest is tidily packaged in that thematic dichotomy can be found in the visual aesthetic, and the two feed back into one and other: The rose-tint of nostalgia against the cultural trauma of fascism.
It can seem counter-intuitive, when one of the major criticisms levied against Anderson’s films is that they hide lack of substance behind beautiful aesthetics. But if we consider that the opposite may be true, can the lush aesthetics of The Grand Budapest Hotel, especially during the aesthetic rug-pull of the tawdry 1968 hotel, be hiding its politics precisely within its visuals? The set designs of Grand Budapest Hotel took inspiration from ski resorts rendered in photochrom, a method of colouring black and white photography by hand. They appear stunning in their subtle pastel palettes. But at the same time, the colours they claim to represent are entirely fabricated- left to the artistic choices of the colourist. The hyperreality throughout The Grand Budapest Hotel reminds us that all is not what it seems, and the centering of characters who would have been sidelined by fascism and other historical oppressions serves to challenge our romanticised notions of pre-war Europe.
Which brings us back to the box. The shape of the box in which the Grand Budapest Hotel plays out literally changes shape throughout the movie. Within, it helps guide us through jumps between time periods, but outside of the box, the changing shape serves to remind us that it is the box that we are watching. That this is a fictionalised, romanticised and nostalgic rendition of a far different reality. I think, if you’ve been willing to follow me this far, the characteristic Wes Anderson visuals and irreverent humour do credit to this film. They make the film appear beautiful and whimsical, but in doing so, challenge the viewer to contemplate what parts of a story remain too painful to tell, what has recollection- and history in turn- brushed outside of the frame?

I knew the Danube River and Hungary at a very young age because of piano — Johann Strauss’s “The Blue Danube”. Nearly 15 years later, in 2014, I finally paid a visit to Hungary.
The Danube river is like a belt twining in the mid Europe. Budapest, straddles the banks of the Danube River, and the buildings in the city are pearls on the Danube belt. I arrived at Budapest at the end of April, as an unprecedented heat wave washed over Europe — from Berlin ,Warsaw, Krakow, Prague, to Budapest, the heat wave was chasing me, along with sudden showers that often arrived late afternoon. When it was not raining, the earth was shrouded in heat radiation.
Budapest used to be two cities — Buda, and Pest. Buda was the capital city, and is presently the capitol. Across the river, Pest is 2 times bigger, where most of the city residents live.
The front foot of Pest was already in modernity, everywhere is Costa Coffee,European version of Starbucks, and every car has a European Union’s license plate, indicating the reform and transition of Hungary; and the back foot was still halted in the old time, as trolleys in 1950s styles were still running, and the marble exterior of most buildings were with had turned into yellow over the years. Pest barely had urban forestry. Exposure to excessive sunlight in late April had melted my skin, as if was some sort of ice cream. Perhaps a while back ago, Pest did have sufficient street trees, but those trees withered. There were always a few corners of the street, full of overgrown glasses, existing there alone without the accompany of street tress.
I did some of my schoolwork (I was an exchange student in a university at Germany) on the first night at a Costa. The coffee shop was quite empty, I was facing a window covered by raindrops that look like crystal sticking on the glass window, reflecting the night light on the street. Only one waitress was serving behind the bar, and she was as young as me. I biked along the river bank crossed the bridge between Buda and pest, again and again. Even Pest was where most of the city population resided, its streets were quite empty, besides a bunch of tourists sitting on the outdoor seating of the cafés around the street corners.
Then the late afternoon rain started dropping. I hided in a Costa Coffee until the rain died down. I paddled the bike over the stone road shining like mirror after the shower. When I got back to the hostel we stayed, I ordered some dishes from the Turkish restaurant across the street — Budapest used to be the biggest Jewish populated city. Millions of Jews were transported to Auschwitz from this city. It’s also the biggest resided city of Romanic people, now, it also a population of Turkish immigrants.
I fled to a Costa coffee until The last night at Budapest, before our departure back to Germany, we met our temporary roommate in the hostel, a Korean lady, around 40 years old- she was single, just quitted her job, flied from South Korea to the European continent, travel alone around Europe. She slept on the upper level of the bunk bed, above me.

Hi there! Maeghan & Oli here - we're taking a break to travel the world and hope you'll join us for the ride. 🌏✈️ 👫 www.alittledetour.ca

We’re not going to lie, Maeghan was a little upset to learn that the Grand Budapest Hotel didn’t exist in real life…. but with everything that we heard about Budapest, she felt optimistic with the our next destination.
Budapest was fantastic. We walked around most days exploring the city and eating great food. There were so many different craft beer bars and bottles shops, this is the first time we didn’t have a chance to hit them all! Budapest was also super popular with stag parties and student travellers — I guess it is just that time of year.
We also hit a snag when we had our first encounter with bed bugs in our Airbnb downtown. But our skills as backpackers has reached a new level of awesome and we had identified the problem, found a new place, packed our bags and were out of there in under 15 minutes.
Other than that, we loved it here so much, we decided to extend our stay not once, but twice 😊
See more on our website www.alittledetour.ca🌏✈️👫
On our second day in Budapest. Maeghan was sitting on the couch journaling and Oli was on his computer researching. We decided to switch places so we could recharge our devices and Olivier went on a hunt to find another power outlet. He looked behind the couch and noticed a tiny little bug on the wall in the living room…. it looked kind of like a bed bug…
So he grabbed a spoon, put the little guy in a glass and started a fine eye search to see if there was more. Well… there was.
Olivier found a dozen or so dead bed bug bodies (or a high confidence they were after looking at Google) and put them on a paper towel. Maeghan called the Airbnb host to ask him about this.. since Olivier kept finding more and more bodies and the skins of the bugs inbetween all the crevases of the couch.
Our host said they had bed bugs a few weeks ago, but had the exterminator come twice.. and not to worry unless we found a living one… and we did..
So within 15 minutes… we had their bags packed, space cleaned and they were ready to peace — with success. No bed bugs were carried and they found a new nicer Airbnb all in the nick of time!
The 2nd largest thermal pools in the world next to Iceland. We hope to visit both!
We saw this and thought of all our PasswordBox friends❤️. Ping Pong was an intense sport in the office, we had two and there would always be tournaments.. or two co-workers battling it out. But this seems like a new level of ping pong!
Ruin bar. Made in the ruins of an old building and furnished with only 2nd hand things. Also, has 18 bars in the one location — so you can go to the wine bar, gin bar, craft beer bar… etc. The best place for any group party!

Let me tell you something upfront — Budapest isn’t the kind of city that screams for your attention like Paris or New York. It doesn’t shove its famous landmarks in your face. Instead, Budapest whispers. It draws you in quietly, one crumbling facade, one steaming chimney, one café window at a time. You don’t just “visit” Budapest — you drift through it.
I’ve walked these streets on misty winter mornings when the Danube looks like a silver ribbon cutting through the grey, and I’ve wandered them under the lazy orange glow of summer evenings when locals sit outside sipping fröccs and laughing like they’ve got all the time in the world. Budapest’s charm lives not only in its grand buildings but in the cracks between them.
This post isn’t about the tourist checklist. You already know the Parliament building looks like a gothic wedding cake and that the Chain Bridge is Instagram-worthy from every angle. I want to talk about the streets, the people, the smells, the awkward little corners where life in Budapest feels raw, imperfect, and utterly human.
You know you’re in the real Budapest when the sidewalks get uneven. The main boulevards — Andrássy Avenue, for example — are polished and postcard-perfect. But duck into the side streets, and suddenly the city exhales. Laundry flaps in courtyards, tiny grocery stores glow under flickering neon, old women with floral scarves shuffle along clutching plastic bags, and young students sit on crumbling stoops scrolling on their phones.
There’s graffiti here — some of it art, some of it just bored teenagers marking territory. But the layers of history are impossible to miss. You’ll pass an art nouveau balcony hanging precariously over a 1970s shoe repair shop. Above, the cracked stucco peels like old paint, revealing the city’s stubborn spirit underneath.
Walk around District VIII — Józsefváros. It’s raw, rough around the edges, but it’s real. Here, hip cafés with Edison bulbs and oat milk lattes sit side-by-side with corner bars where old men drink Unicum and mutter about politics. If you want shiny, sanitized Europe — this isn’t it. But if you want life? Welcome to Budapest.
Budapest has a specific smell — part bakery, part car exhaust, part sweet paprika floating from someone’s kitchen window. And yes, sometimes a hint of cigarettes — Hungarians smoke like it’s still 1995. But that mixture? It feels like a real city. A city where people live, not just pose for photos.
Stop by a pékség (bakery) in the morning. The langos might already be sizzling in oil, but most locals are grabbing simple pastries — kifli (crescent rolls), túrós batyu (sweet cheese pockets), maybe a slice of pogácsa (savory scone) if they skipped breakfast. Coffee? Strong. Cheap. No nonsense. Just the way it should be.
Here’s what I love — Budapest locals don’t care that you’re a tourist. They’re not rude, they’re not overly friendly — they’re just… doing their thing. If you want to fit in, keep your voice down, your head up, and your eyes open. Don’t expect big grins and “How’s your day going?” — this isn’t Disneyland. But ask for directions? Most people will help. Stumble through a few words in Hungarian? Their eyes soften immediately.
My favorite? Watching older folks play chess in the parks, completely oblivious to the TikTok kids filming dance videos nearby. It’s two worlds colliding — but that’s Budapest.
Skip the overpriced tourist menus on Váci Street. Head to the side streets for hearty, grandmother-approved meals. Goulash soup in a steaming ceramic bowl. Crispy duck legs with red cabbage. Cheap, buttery nokedli dumplings. It’s heavy. It’s filling. It’s perfect for cold evenings when your breath fogs the air.
And the bakeries? Let me say it again — never underestimate a Hungarian pastry.
Okay, let’s get real for a second. Budapest might feel like another world, but getting here isn’t rocket science.
Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport (BUD) welcomes budget airlines and major carriers alike. From most European cities, flights hover around €30–€100 if you book smart. From the US? Expect around $500–$800 round-trip, depending on the season.
Skip the overpriced taxis at arrivals. The 100E Airport Bus runs straight to the city center for about €5. Runs every 20 minutes. Easy.
It wasn’t the fancy cafés or grand architecture. It was this random Tuesday morning in early spring. Light drizzle. Streets still wet from rain. I ducked into a tiny coffee shop off Kálvin tér. The window fogged up as I sipped bitter coffee and listened to Hungarian indie rock playing softly. Outside, people hurried past with umbrellas, the city carrying on, oblivious to my little moment of stillness.
That? That’s why I travel. Not for the bucket list. For the seconds in between.
Budapest is rough around the edges, sometimes crumbling, often unpredictable — but never fake. It doesn’t try to impress you with perfection. It lets you discover its flaws, its beauty, its rhythm — and decide for yourself.
You might not “fall in love” instantly. But give it time. Walk the streets. Breathe in the mix of pastry, paprika, and city life. Listen to the language you don’t understand but somehow feels familiar.
And when you leave? You’ll miss it — I promise.

This article is a postscript to a previous article I wrote about how Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel uses a timeline of cinematic technology and formatting to differentiate nesting framing devices. Hinted at but slightly outside of the scope of that article was Anderson’s use of theatrical techniques. Specifically- in echoing Brecht’s Epic Theatre. The Grand Budapest Hotel deals directly with fascism, so it seems worthwhile to compare the Marxist and antifascist underpinnings of Brecht’s technique, with the ways Wes Anderson succeeds (and fails) to employ them.
One of the primary goals for the establishment of the Frankfurt School was to interrogate why the German Revolution of 1918 ended the way it did. How did the birthplace of Karl Marx find itself at the end of a political upheaval turning to the allures of capitalism, and ultimately, fascism?
Bertolt Brecht’s Epic Theatre is one of a number of artistic forms which attempted to side-step the motivations of capitalism and to speak directly to his audience. I am no Brecht scholar, and a lot of nuance will be glossed over in this article, however put as simply as possible Epic Theatre employed a range of techniques aimed to snap their audience back into reality. And where were they really? They were in a theatre, watching a play.
Brecht thought that by refusing to let his audience suspend their disbelief, he could force them to engage with the ideas and values of his play, rather than getting lost in investment in the character’s emotional journeys. Brecht was a Marxist, and the ideas and values his plays contained were often specifically anti-capitalist ones. Some thinkers of the Frankfurt School further theorised on these techniques, which we’ll talk about later in this article.
“I find Bertolt Brecht’s epic form, only out of focus, muddied by the bourgeois values of the neoliberal era.” says G.D. Brown of Wes Anderson’s most recent film The French Dispatch in a fairly incendiary Popmatters Article.
No matter Wes’ personal politics, his work is forged in neoliberalism. No matter how artistically successful any viewer may find his works, it is the box office that decides whether Wes Anderson keeps making movies. Furthermore, if he does aspire to the same revolutionary art which forged the Brechtian aesthetic, it is not apparent from his subject matter, nor his frequent brand collaborations.
“It is hardly a wonder that Anderson has directed commercials for SoftBank and American Express, for the likes of Stella Artois, Prada, H&M, AT&T, Hyundai, and Sony. His highly-stylized advertisements have connected common products and the arms of finance to sophisticated notions of film as elevated art, to visual reassurances of certain standards of taste and cultured cool. Of course, Anderson is not the first director of artistic merit to commercialize his talents. Supper won’t pay for itself.” G.D. Brown, Life After Brecht: Wes Anderson’s Lowbrow Dialectics
For Brown, the neoliberalism of Anderson’s aesthetic is rotten to its core: Its themes of minority identity under fascism function as appeals to the comfort of modernity rather than provocative calls to action. Indeed, the communists in Grand Budapest are just as hostile and threatening to the film's protagonists as the fascists (whether the communists depicted in Grand Budapest represent anything like actual communism is outside of the scope of this article.)
“In Brecht’s plays, his cues leading audiences away from the naturalist immersion of storytelling and toward the theater as an unreal portrayal (his breaking the fourth wall, his narrators and movements into song, and so on) were meant to prod the viewer into meaningful engagement with their own historical circumstances…
Anderson has faced criticism for his portrayal of largely white, upper-class characters in contrast with the roles of workers and people of color. As the viewer becomes aware of Anderson’s on-screen values, they must, like Brecht, take on the dialectical mindset to best understand the infusion of revolutionary form and bourgeois content, placing Anderson in the context of the neoliberal turn of the last half of the 20th Century.”
— G.D. Brown, Life After Brecht: Wes Anderson’s Lowbrow Dialectics
The accusation- for those who find this style exhausting (and I’m aware my writing often falls into this style)- is that Wes Anderson uses the stylings of revolutionary art, which is real and important. However, he uses them as a hollow appropriation. Anderson (though not necessarily through conscious intention) is packaging up the Brecht’s technique the same way he packages up other high-brow aesthetics (fine art, high fashion), resulting in an easily digestible remedy for intellectual and class anxiety.
An excellent quote from Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello’s The New Spirit of Capitalism, (which I pilfered from an also great Broey Deschanel video) spells out the process by which contemporary capitalism consumes and repackages revolutionary ideas, saying:
“To maintain its powers of attraction, capitalism therefore has to draw upon resources external to it, beliefs which, at a given moment in time, possess considerable powers of persuasion, striking ideologies, even when they are considered hostile to it.”
— Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello, The New Spirit of Capitalism
Conversely, it could be argued that this form of neoliberal media is the necessary conduit to deliver revolutionary ideas to a mainstream audience. In The Andersonian Theatricality by Irene Kalesi, Anderson’s use of humour is explored as a cloak through which to smuggle critique and revolutionary ideas. Having made the link to Brechtian technique, Kalesi writes:
Comedy when used accurately can be the harshest judge of situations and the greatest fighter for change. Jones points out that “comedy is a vehicle for subtly (or not so subtly) addressing these injustices by mocking the social norms in the hope of slowly changing the masses’ beliefs about the inequalities”. Therefore, the employment of comedy can be pointed towards parodying and thus criticizing war and the collapse of the social ideals. The comedic atmosphere helps the audience engage with the film’s sensitive topic, namely a story that takes place during a tumultuous historical period. This bittersweet story needs the comedic perspective in order to avoid being an overly emotional burden on the viewer. The power of theatre is that it helps the audience not to identify with a character per se but it makes them contemplate deeply about the events happening on stage. According to Aristophanes, serious matters should be touched by the genre of comedy. As Dicaepolis from “Acharnians” says: “Comedy too can sometimes discern what is right. I shall not please but I shall say what is true”. Therefore, the power of comedy is to reveal truths and centralize issues that concern the spectators.
— Irene Kalesi, The Andersonian Theatricality
In Marxist theory, praxis is the putting of theory into action: it can be used to emphasise the importance of engagement and activity toward a common goal, without dismissing the importance of theory.
So does Wes Anderson’s work, specifically The Grand Budapest Hotel, hold up to the criticisms of the Frankfurt School aestheticians who created the groundwork for understanding Brecht’s epic theatre? I’m not uniquely qualified to tell you. But we can try to chase the logic down together: Writing specifically about Brecht, Walter Benjamin wrote:
“The task of epic theatre, Brecht believes, is not so much to develop actions as to represent conditions. But ‘represent’ does not here signify ‘reproduce’ in the sense used by the theoreticians of Naturalism. Rather, the first point at issue is to uncover those conditions. (One could just as well say: to make them strange.) This uncovering (making strange, alienating) of conditions is brought about by processes being interrupted.”
— Walter Benjamin, Understanding Brecht
And furthermore:
“Epic theatre casts doubt upon the notion that theatre is entertainment. It shakes the social validity of theatre-as-entertainment by robbing it of its function within the capitalist system. It also threatens the privileges of the critics. These privileges are based on the technical expertise which enables the critic to make certain observations about productions and performances. The criteria he applies in making his observations are only very rarely within his own control; he seldom worries about this, but relies upon ‘theatre aesthetics’ in the details of which nobody is particularly interested. If, however, the aesthetic of the theatre ceases to remain in the background, if its forum is the audience and its criterion is no longer the effect registered by the nervous system of single individuals but the degree to which the mass of spectators becomes a coherent whole, then the critic as he is constituted today is no longer ahead of that mass but actually finds himself far behind it.”
— Walter Benjamin, Understanding Brecht
This leaves us at somewhat of a junction in considering Anderson. Is the Andersonian Aesthetic a reproduction of these ‘theatre aesthetics’, or does the use of theatrical technique and aesthetic in a cinematic context alienate the viewer from more conservative cinematic techniques? I think your opinions about neoliberalism may define where you sit.
If all revolutionary aesthetics are consumed and repackaged under capitalism, is praxis in media possible? Herbert Marcuse, another thinker of the Frankfurt School, was slightly more optimistic.
“It seems that art as art expresses a truth, an experience, a necessity which, although not in the domain of radical praxis, are nevertheless essential components of revolution”
— Herbert Marcuse, The Aesthetic Dimension
Marcuse took it one step further than Benjamin in that he believed it was the authentic artistic experience that anyone could encounter the thirst for revolution and come to sympathise with the failings of capitalism. Whether Wes Anderson’s art hits even this bar for authenticity is again up to personal judgment.
That capitalism will, in time, homogenise all cinematic aesthetics into a sort of grey sludge seems inevitable. You can see it happen in real time. But hangers-on like Wes Anderson, who thrive in a space that is alternative if only by degrees- these artists may well be the first glimpse of real art many filmgoers experience. Can intellectually honest ideas be mined from these works? This writer believes that even if they can’t, you ought to look.

When I was younger, single with not many cares in this world, I traveled quite a bit. I still do but it’s different now.
I was fortunate to work for a company based near Bristol, England. Once or twice a year I would travel to our corporate offices for meetings and/or training. Lucky me!
I would almost always take advantage of being overseas and book my vacations from there. Inexpensive flights to European cities made it a no-brainer.
One of the trips I took was to Budapest. I was quite spoiled as I acquired hotel points that allowed me to stay in hotels I would not have otherwise been able to afford.
Like the Marriott right on the Vltava River overlooking the Chain Bridge and Castle Hill. This was the view from my room.
I spent five or so days wandering around. For three of those days, a co-worker friend flew over and met me. It was nice to have someone to hang out with for a few days.

It was so interesting to read your experience of Budapest. It has been a long time since I visited that beautiful city. It has a special place in my heart because my parents grew up there.

The more we observe a city, the more apparent it becomes that it surpasses the sum of its parts. It resembles a colossal, intricate organism with its network of organs and unique internal dynamics. These dynamics are a tapestry woven from our daily interactions within the city: the bustling morning and evening rush on the tram or subway lines and leisurely strolls along the riverbank — it all contributes to this vibrant tapestry.
Though it sounds idyllic, it stands worlds apart from the vast data streams of corporations, the omnipresent data visualization tools, the ongoing buzz about artificial intelligence across various platforms, or even the fundamental essence of artistic expression — music.
“Melody of Budapest,” sponsored by Telekom Hungary, aims to bridge these divides by transforming the city’s dynamic mobility patterns into a musical piece using data science and AI. Initially, Janosov and the data team of Telekom Hungary processed large-scale cell tower-based mobility data at a resolution of 100m into digestible information. This unpublished data covers the temporal and spatial specifics of every mobile phone event on Telekom’s network in Budapest, Hungary, from June 2022 to 2023, linked to their…

Dear Margaret,
I traveled home to Hungary several times since I moved to France, the last time we met. I always just ran through the city to catch my connection to my home town and never stopped by to embrace the beauty of it again. Since you moved abroad too, there was nothing to keep me here for longer.
This time, it was different. My boyfriend came with me and I started to look at the streets we used to walk distinctly — like I’ve never seen them before, like an actual tourist.
At first glance, it seemed like everything remained the same — your favorite art nouveau buildings, the century old parks, historical squares… If only those walls could talk!
Yet, everything seemed changed. It’s been only 4 years since we said our goodbye here but it feels like decades have passed.
I took my boyfriend to the Danube river, or as we call it in Hungarian: Duna, for a stroll taking advantage of the last warm days of summer. I never noticed before how green our capital is, did you Margaret? I don’t recall if we ever talked about it.

Recently, I was on a river cruise through the Lower Danube on AmaWaterways with Christian (TellMeWhyTravel). The stops along the way included Budapest, Hungary, Bratislava, Slovakia, Durnstein, Salzburg, and Vienna, Austria. All of the cities are known for its historical importance from war, due to their strategic location on the river, to arts and culture, where some of the greatest minds which ever existed created. However, by the time you’ve gotten to this page, you already know about Mozart, the Hungarian Parliament, Buda Castle, and the other tourist attractions your tour guide will show you. As our tour guide YOLO (Yes! That’s his name!) said, “Do you see ABC? ABC, another bloody church, additional broken castle.” While I can respect the art and architecture, and the blood, sweat, and tears that went into the churches, castles, and monuments of the era, once I’ve seen one (or two) I’ve kind of seen them all. (There are definitely some cool churches and castles but that’s for a different story!)
I’m going to take you off the beaten path and show you some of the art and culture of today in these cities. Today’s obscure artists will be the Mozart’s, Picasso’s, and Spielberg’s of tomorrow. The Internet has brought most of the things to our homes but art is something we must experience in person!
If you’re staying at the Aria next to the Church of St. Stephen, you’re in a good place to start.
Most of the museums are within walking distance between 1–3 miles and you’ll get to see the other landmarks of Budapest along the way!
So let’s get started!
Want to check out some contemporary art museums further up?
Both of these museums looked pretty cool, unfortunately the Q was temporarily closed for installation.
If you’re already tired or didn’t see anything interesting you can check out the Széchenyi Thermal Bath, which features 18 pools and saunas but also has an exciting retro architecture, which reminded me of high school.
But maybe you’re not done yet. Walk down past the ruin bars to the Palace District.
Have a drink or two here, usually you’ll find some live music, poetry reading, or lively conversation!
From here there are a few advanced options:
About 25 minutes away is the Ludwig Museum, related to the Mumok in Vienna. It’s worth seeing some of the collection which includes Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, and Joseph Beuys.
Cross the bridge and at the base of Gellért-hegy Jubileumi park is Faur Zsófi Gallery. We hiked to the top of it, but the park is still undergoing renovations but a stunning view nonetheless.
Also closeby is the music venue A38, where we were lucky enough to see the band Henge.
Not tired yet? Cross the chain bridge and get to the Buda side of the city.
In the oldest part of the city, Obuda, stands a shrine to one of the city’s most famous contemporary artists, Victor Vasarely, the father of the optical art movement.
Then cross back over to Pest and hit Kalman Maklary Fine Arts an interesting contemporary gallery (no exhibitions this year yet) which is close to parliament and a short stroll from the Aria.
If you happen to come in mid October, check out Art Market Budapest which is also near the first round of galleries near the opera house and the Aria.
Now if you didn’t finish all of that in your two day pre-cruise, don’t worry, you’ll have a chance to come back at the end of the cruise!
Sailing
The Slovak National Gallery is close to where the ship docks.
Three options for the outskirts of the city; I don’t think you can walk here, you might need to take a taxi, bike, or public transportation.
Rudavskys Magic Garden: The garden is closed for the winter, but looks incredible when it’s warmer!
The Július Koller Society
Tranzit
Danubiana Meulensteen Art Museum: This looks like a very cool museum atop a peninsula jutting into the Danube. I didn’t see it from the ship, but along with its sculpture park, it seems like an awesome place to check out the latest contemporary art!
Sailing
The next stop is in the Wachau Valley, specifically Durnstein. While Durnstein is a quiet town with not much contemporary art, 8km from Durnstein is a small cosmopolitan town, Krems an der Donau, with some interesting art options.
The map is zoomed out to show the proximity to Durnstein where the ship is docked.
Sailing
The following day we docked and took about a 90 minute bus ride to the quaint city of Salzburg, known for being the birthplace of Mozart. It’s also known for being the backdrop to the 1960’s classic The Sound of Music.
The city is surrounded by a steep rock face which made it an impenetrable during times of war. However, the top of mountain is a contemporary art museum. You get natural and manmade art from the top of the elevator ride!
But before we get there, global gallery Thaddaeus Ropac has two locations in Salzburg! Check to see if there are exhibitions at the farther one near the train station before you trek up there.
Finally, Galerie HAAS & GSCHWANDTNER is moving from its downtown location to somewhere else within Salzburg. Check their website to see where they end up!
Sailing
We made it! Vienna, Austria the largest, most cosmopolitan city on the Danube. The art scene here is huge with tons of galleries, museums, and history.
We will try to avoid the two most famous artists from Austria, Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt, because the Neue Gallery on 86th and 5th in New York houses Ronald Lauder’s huge collection of Austrian art including Klimt’s Lady in Gold.
The bus to old city will drop you about 5 minutes northeast of St. Stephen’s Cathedral.
There are a lot of galleries in the first district, here’s the east side of the city first.
The west side is next, the order is assuming that you are coming from the bus drop off location
On the east side of the outer museum loop
There are a few major art fairs that take place in Vienna:
March: Spark Art Fair
May: Affordable Art Fair
September: Vienna Contemporary and Curated By
November: Vienna Art Week
Austrian artists that I didn’t get a chance to see:
Stefan Eins: He stopped by my Times Square exhibition multiple times and had some crazy stories about when he started Fashion Moda in the South Bronx in the 80s.
Andre Heller: Multi-hyphenate who commissioned Luna Luna
Helmut Lang: the famed photographer
Franz West: Sculptor and artist
On the outskirts of the city is the Essl Museum, which houses what is considered the most important collection of Austrian art after 1945.
From here the ship sails back to the beginning port, Budapest.
Did we miss something? Drop a comment and we’ll be sure to check it out next time and let you know how it was.
Interested in recreating this experience? (You’ll now have the maps to save time instead of us stumbling around)
Here’s the link to the AmaWaterways cruise and the Aria hotel, which is voted the best in Central Europe consistently!
NB: There was an issue with Google Maps acting weird so instead of wasting time figuring it out, I made different maps for each art “district” in Budapest and Vienna.

There is a certain pattern I notice in cities all over Europe that is both unique and also interesting. If there is a huge shopping mall either as part of the complex or in the immediate vicinity of the main railway station of an urban area, that particular city has a lot to offer to its visitors. In the case of Poznań, it is no different either.
On the surface, the city on the River Warta is one of Poland’s largest urban conurbations, a hub of education, and an important business center. However, once you scratch the surface, the city becomes significantly more than another bustling metropolis. Poznań is home to a plethora of historic and cultural references.
Amid the many modern buildings and high-rise apartments, the city also showcases an eclectic mix of Baroque, Gothic and neoclassical architecture. There are many Budynek zabytkowy (listed buildings) and Pomnik historii (historic monuments) scattered around in the city, the ownership of which comes with certain obligations and restrictions.
On second thoughts, I believe a major shopping mall attached to the main station complex in…

Ever wondered how to draw a map of less common geographical areas? And color them based on some data? This pair of tutorials shows how to build this from scratch! First, you need to construct the border of your polygons — Part 1 is about this task. After that you need to create a map, and color those polygons according to some value of your interest. That will be shown in Part 2.
Part 1 of this tutorial is available here.
There are many tutorials on the internet for drawing maps in Python, even more sophisticated maps like heatmaps (where heat is basically the density of points in an area) or choropleth maps (where polygons are colored according to some arbitrary value). However, these tutorials are mainly done on states of the United States. View some great ones with plot.ly or an also otherwise superb one with folium. For the US, these packages have some convenience methods, but for the rest of the world, they’re of little use. Alternatively, they are based on some accidentally available json file like this one with Altair. Obviously, these are not general solutions to the problem of creating a map of some areas of your choice. I aim to give a general solution in these articles.
In this second part you will:
The code is also available on GitHub:
github.com
A GeoJson is actually a JSON file with some predetermined structure. The function above generates a GeoJSON file from a list of points by JSON dumping a dictionary formatted like a GeoJSON file. In these dictionaries, there are only 3 keys: lat, lon and name. Lat and lon stand for the coordinates, while name identifies the shape that the point belongs to. The order of these dictionaries in the list is also critical, you can read about this in the first part of this tutorial.
GeoDataFrames are a subclass of classic `pandas` DataFrames with a special column. This special column, geometry contains all the information that makes this DataFrame geo-aware. A GeoDataFrame object can be easily created from a GeoJSON file, you can add additional data to polygons easily, and just as easily convert it back to a GeoJSON file for visualization purposes.
In this snippet to the left centroids are added to each polygon. By this, we can add a nice marker to the centroid’s location depicting information about the polygon - in this case, the district. Just as easily as this, other data can be added using a plain pandas merge. Here, income tax per capita data is added to each polygon!
The creation of the map consists of 4 important steps:
Firstly, map creation is just as easy as it seems. You should provide a starting position, a starting zoom, and a tiles argument which is responsible for the basic design of your map. Be aware, that folium expects coordinates in latitude, longitude order!
Secondly, creating the choropleth is also easy, but it requires a neatly structured GeoJSON file. The parameters of the choropleth method speak for themselves, but you can refer to the documentation if something is not clear. This creates a layer where polygons are colored according to income tax per capita data — the more the greener, the less the yellower.
Thirdly, A FeatureGroup object is created. This object consist of Marker objects signalling each district’s name and the respective income tax per capita value to give the reader exact amounts apart from the color coding from choropleth. Lastly, LayerControl is added to the map in order to make it possible to show or hide layers, such as the choropleth or the FeatureGroup layer.
Finally, the map can be saved and the created .html file opened using your browser. You can find it on my github, in the outputs folder, but here is a snippet of it:
The main takeaway here is that in creating a beautiful choropleth map — just like in any data science project — data preparation takes around 90% of the effort. We got to know OpenStreetMap data structures and the Overpass API, and solved an interesting problem in Part 1. In Part 2, using GeoDataFrames made it easier to add information to our GeoJSON files and maps. It is also clear for me, that if you are creating maps in Python, folium is the way to go. As you can see, creating a map can be a one-liner, and creating choropleth maps or showing markers with html popups are really easy with folium.

Budapest is one of my favourite cities. Had an absolutely delightful day here. I would even chuck in a few of my other blog buzz words including “beautiful”, “lovely” and “ absolutely amazing”.
What better way to start the day. I had booked a tour which could have up to 8 guests and showed up at Central Market Hall. It was $145 which was a massive stretch but honestly why not. This is an incredible building inspired by the Eiffel Tower. The Hungarian government built four of these across the city in the 1870’s after all the open air markets got infested with cockroaches and snow for most of the year.
To my incredible fortune, the mysterious Mr & Mrs Chapelle from the US were both unwell and unable to attend. Private tour baby! With portions made for 4! I steeled myself for feeling like a spoiled baby.
I now also felt no concern in asking Orsha to photograph me as her happy customer.
Over the four hours and 12 spots I was reminded just why I love food tours. The history of a people is in their food. It explains their culture, customs and sends you directly into every family’s dinner table. Hungarian food also happens to perfectly correlate with my food preferences. We are talking:
I will now give you the rundown in several loose listicle paragraphs.
Market foods were first up.
This is their street food. A donut covered in garlic juice, sour cream and a mild cheddar. How could this not be delicious.
Next up we had the salami. I tried types called horse, curly haired pig, pork cheese (has all the different bits of the animal as different cubes) and Hungarian winter. Horse weirdly tasted how I thought it would. A wild earthy flavour that made me think of riding horses.
Some of the interesting things we saw in the market include a tonne of foie gras- Hungary is one the worlds largest producers- a tonne of fat and a delicacy of a whole chicken with an egg still in it.
A benefit of being on this tour alone was that Orsha had to field all my questions. She was likely unprepared for the grilling that arrived. Some facts for you:
The pickle tasting. That is right. The Hungarians are super into pickles. I was led down several alleys to the pickle basement. Cordoned off due to its offensive fragrance. She was concerned I might not like the smell. As an amateur pickler and somebody that has hosted an actual pickle party she couldn’t have worried more pointlessly.
Enter Marika, my hero. Handmaking pickles in the basement for over 50 years.
I got to choose my very own pickle selection and try them out. Easily the best I have ever had. My favourites were the kraut and the mini watermelons.
When I get back I am going to flat out not stop until I have prepared a pickle jar with a smile on it. Look forward to Christmas presents everybody as I think a month of unemployment should just about do it.
Also coincidentally I screenshotted this yesterday. I will just leave it here.
You know what else the Hungarians are into? Deliciousness. Lunch was this sausage and goulash place. Served with oodles of cabbage and horseradish. Divine. Followed by some iced coffee and cake that I ate before taking a picture of. It started with one forkful, then quickly snowballed until both slices were gobbled up.
I learnt a bit more historical stuff from Orsha too. Something I noticed as soon as I got off the train was how decrepit all the old buildings were. I asked Orsha what was up with that.
Basically what happened was that the Hungarians sided with Germany in both world wars. Hence they had massive damage in WW2 from gunfire and allied bombing.
After WW2 Hungary lost heaps of its land and was handed to the Soviets. After that they were largely communist. The soviets converted all the rich aristocratic houses into social housing and didn’t bother to repair them for 50 years. Hence the damage on these houses is genuinely from WW2.
There was also a large wall discovered from the original Budapest boundaries recently that we strolled past.
The strangest part of the whole thing was the final portion of the tour. Wine and cheese tasting with an actual sommelier in a huge cellar. I must say this was certainly not designed for one person, and certainly not a wine noob such as myself. I laughed and sipped and enjoyed desert wine with blue cheese as I nodded along to my very own personal wine lecture. A glorious combination.
My personal sommelier had not much to say to me after I requested to try some non alcoholic wines. I was having too much fun at this time and asked him all about what he thought about them. He said simply that it was a disgrace and “grape juice”. Oh Gregor. Keep pouring em.
I strolled home after this, quite drunk and somehow lost an earring. A perfect day really. Topped up off with such a heavy nap that I fell asleep on my sunglasses and hairbrush.
Loving it here. Really coming into its own this whole “Europe” thing. The further east we are getting the more I am loving it which is promising. The fast pace is also a nice change that is making time go very fast.
Today was just great. I very clearly need to do more food tours as it is just about my favourite experience a human can have. Tired but loved today.

I knew so much, when I was living in Budapest thirty years ago. And not only a lot more Hungarian than I know today.
I knew about the national poet and revolutionary Sándor Petöfi and about playwright and author Ferenc Molnár, after whom I name the fictitious Molnár Club in Birds of Passage. I still know a bit about them, and you may know of them, too.
In 1990 I was hearing a lot of talk in our Budapest social circle about the poet and playwright János Pilinszki, who had died about 10 years earlier and was still revered. He would definitely be on my fictional playwright Gábor’s mind.
And back then I knew about Gyula Krúdy, too; I’d even seen the acclaimed 1972 Zoltán Huszárik film Szindbád based on his work. I liked the idea that down-and-out Kalliopé – my favourite character in the novel – would think so longingly of the bone soup that figures in the film.
But I’d forgotten all about Pilinszki and Krúdy by the time I was rereading Birds of Passage this spring. Their names had become as foreign to me as they may be to you. I had to Google them to figure out why I’d included them in the novel, what they add to the characterization of Gábor and Kalliopé, and how I wanted to create a sense of the Budapest cultural milieu of the time.
I had no great hopes for Birds of Passage when I was writing it, and it had become too close to me for me to see it clearly when I finished it. I was thrilled when Karen Haughian of Signature Editions (then Nuage) wanted to publish it in 1993, and surprised when the review copies she sent out included one to the Times Literary Supplement.
And I did get lots of reviews, even as an unknown and unheralded writer.
The Globe and Mail was reviewing first novels in those days, CBC Radio discussed them on air, and publications like Books in Canada (now defunct) published thoughtful pieces unimaginable today — and paid the reviewers small but useful sums for doing so. I was the cover story in Hour magazine, also long-defunct, and I was interviewed by Shelagh Rogers.
Publishing a novel is nerve-wracking, and publicising a first novel is like having ball lightning in your kitchen. The work you have been obsessing over for years is out in the world – and being read by people you know and people you don’t know. They all have opinions of it, and some will tell you what they think, and who knows what they’ll say? Most will say little, if they say anything at all, and there’s no way of knowing if that’s even worse.
And then there’ll be the reviews – and far more people will read those than ever read your book.
An awful lot depends on reviews, which is the main reason for lamenting how few there now are.
I read the reviews of Birds of Passage with trepidation and astonishment.
The Globe’s was among the first:“Leith handles emotional crisis adroitly, without being clichéd. Her prose style is observant, quick and spare.” That was okay, pretty good, really.
Speaking on “The Arts Tonight” on CBC Radio, author Antanas Sileika praised the book in extravagant terms: “If you like Milan Kundera, if you like Vaclav Havel, you’re going to love this novel.”
Books in Canada described my novel as “remarkable” and published a long and thoughtful review article:
“Because Birds of Passage is a very sophisticated book, the title cuts many ways. The various birds that inhabit apartments, tunnels, mines, and nests enrich the story without intruding on it: suggestions of freedom and confinement, of beauty and fragility, rise naturally into the narrative. Moreover, because Gabor is a writer, Leith is able to comment playfully on her own creation. The novel’s ending seemed a touch contrived, but in a book of such varied delights this is a very small quibble. Leith has the gifts of a natural storyteller.”
The Times Literary Supplement took its time (its review appeared in 1994), but was well worth the wait:
“Hungary 1990 — with dissident lives redundant after the defeat of Communism, market prices making beggars of the population and foreign feminism knocking rudely at the door — is the setting for this excellent first novel. Birds of Passage explores the tenuous relationship between a Canadian couple and their Hungarian neighbours. Linda Leith is perceptive and never sentimental about the role Hungary plays in the lives of the Canadians, Alice and Daniel.
“Across the street from them, the playwright, Gabor, a romantic, who has mostly escaped reality by living the cloak-and-dagger existence of an underground political activist, cannot settle down to domestic responsibility; his apartment is full of sparrows trapped by the closed windows.
“Leith is good on the claustrophobic, old-fashioned feel of Central Europe, with its male heroes, its sacred places and works of art which artificially perpetuate a culture shut off from the international mainstream. Hungarian men in particular are so well adapted to the cage that when released they can barely survive. Alice, who has a strong character and appalling clothes sense, is impressive. Leith has that cool, precise way with the passions that makes one think of Alison Lurie.”
I had read only one book by Alison Lurie, whom The New York Times described as a “tart-voiced novelist of manners.” I didn’t see Birds of Passage as a novel of manners, but I was delighted with my allegedly “cool, precise way with the passions.”
TLS reviews were unsigned back then, and I did wish (and I still wish) I knew who had written this. Whoever it had clearly made the acquaintance of one or two Central European men.
I also wish I’d written to these and other reviewers to tell them how much I appreciated their comments on my book. I was a novice, and I didn’t know I could do that.
Getting a great review is one of the joys of becoming a writer – but then I got a letter from an outraged Hungarian émigrée who didn’t like my book at all.
This woman sang the praises of her homeland — and heartily wished that Birds of Passage had done the same. She deplored characters in my novel that she found unsavoury, including dear Kalliopé — and protested I’d sold Hungary short.
I didn’t agree then, and I don’t agree now, for a novel is not a travel brochure, and Alison Lurie is hardly the only novelist who can be tart-voiced. As Mavis Gallant once put it, “No writer calls a truce.”
But I am grateful to this woman for her letter. Hers was the response to Birds of Passage that did most to convince me I’d done my job as a novelist.

Hansje van Halem gave an amazing and very inspiring lecture during the 8th edition of Graphifest in the Design Terminal on 11 November 2014. After her talk she was so kind and answered my questions.
It’s always good to meet a person who is so passionate and enthusiastic when it comes to talking about his/her job. Dutch graphic and book designer Hansje van Halem, who has studied at Gerrit Rietveld Academy and has been working as a freelancer since graduation, is such a person. She used to hate typography because of the rules, but since she can work freely and do experiments she introduces their wonderful creations to the world regularly.
First of all, thank you for your lecture, it was really great. You have mentioned a lot of things regarding your career so I would be interested in the beginnings now. How and when did you first meet design? Did you actually want to be a designer when you were a child?One of my first memories thinking about my future can be dated back to when I was around 8 years. It was when we were taught how to draw perspective by using a ruler; we drew lines that looked endless. I remember making those drawings and thinking: I would like to have a job where I could use a ruler. I have realised now that I have a job for which I can use a ruler as it’s about measuring and calculation.
I also remember, at some point being ten or eleven, I wanted to be a theatre or movie director. I think that also makes sense because I should make a lot of decisions and to do a lot of processing.
It also has to be mentioned that both of my parents are artists so I grew up in an environment where my father had his studio next to our house and my mother had her atelier inside the house. So I was always surrounded by people making stuff and by material and equipment. I didn’t grow up like going to museums all the time but I did grow up in an environment where if I had an idea it was okay to cut and make something. I also remember begging my father: I had a huge stack of paper, and I would beg my father if he could put it under my mother’s sewing machine. It had to be sewed in the middle, and then I folded and filled the book. Additionally, as a kid, I loved the typewriter, I used it to create books.
You also said that you hated typography, however, the Netherlands is famous for type design and letters, so I’m wondering how it was possible.I started art school when I was 19 or 20; I went to a really formal one where they said: “These are the rules, this is how you should do it. When you do it differently, you do it wrong.” Moreover, I was a kid of an artist, my mother was also a teacher in a different art school, and I knew that art/design is always about pushing boundaries, looking for differences in things. At my school they didn’t teach this way of designing, it was all about rules, and in order to do a good job you had to live up to them.
Personally, I was too afraid, I knew if I made an S, then it had to be according to the rules. Then I changed school and went to this more Bauhaus type of working with teachers like Experimental Jetset, (Good)Will Holder, Jop van Bennekom and Gerard Unger. They were all so secure of their own work, that they easily gave space to their students. They would not give you an assignment like “create an S”, but said like “do a project with numbers”. I could just loose my imagination into looking at their systems. In addition to that, I could also find the space to experiment and to find out what’s right or wrong on my own without having a teacher saying this is right and this is wrong.
Do you think education is necessary, I mean does one have to go to school to be a good graphic designer?Of course, there are people who don’t have education, but I don’t know how anyone could afford not to spend four years full-time with so many professionals dedicated to this specific topic. You can learn so much, and you can have such a great time. If you do it on your own with a job on aside, I don’t think you get this level of knowledge and practice. I wouldn’t be a graphic designer without education, as I couldn’t have learnt so much in such a short time. Of course, you learn more after school than during school but that’s not the same.
You have also mentioned that you have your studio in your apartment. Do you think it’s a good idea to have a studio in one’s home?I forgot to tell… I worked from my student room in 2003–2004. It started to feel really weird when I started to have clients over. Sometimes they would leave late to get the work finished and there would be only a short period of time between the moment when the client left and the moment when I got undressed to go to sleep. Time to get some studio space!
After having a studio for a couple of years I was fed up and moved my work space back into my (now bigger) house in 2009. That was a very productive period of two years. I took in an intern and started a gallery space in my living room showcase cabinet. But when I was sitting on the edge of my bed having dinner, I realised I needed my house back. Again, I started looking for a studio in 2011, and now I have a really nice one about 15 minutes away from my house. It’s good to have a start and a finish every day even if the day takes very long. It’s also nice that when I come home there isn’t a room full of sketches.
Do you work alone or sometimes within a group maybe?I work alone. Sometimes I need help but this is always on different levels. If I’m busy and some correction rounds need to be done regarding a book I know somebody who is more precise than I am so I just hire her. But I do everything alone basically. One of my wishes for my next life is to be a designer duo because it’s kind of lonely sometimes.
How many projects do you usually work on at the same time? I assume creating a book it’s a great amount of work.Oh, yes. It can be zero projects so I make my own stuff but it can be 5 or 7 projects at the same time. Of course, they don’t have the deadline all at once because it would be impossible to complete all the tasks, so it has to be one project starting, one waiting for reply, etc. I think I do my best when I have multiple things do to because otherwise I would start to make a big deal out of making decisions.
I’m just curious, do you use a calendar or do you know all the deadlines by heart?I keep many of them in my head, I usually know that I have a deadline next week.
How many projects are you working on right now?I am in some kind of troubles this week as I’m not working here. I’m getting a solo exhibition in Eindhoven; I’m making a spin-off of my publication, it will be 48 pages instead of 484 and it will be cheaper as well.
Yesterday I was in a supermarket in Budapest, and the printer called me and said: “We are running out of time. I’m afraid we are not gonna make it.” I was like “I’m in Budapest, I cannot do anything”. So it was a bit stressful. I was invited to design a fence for a company in Holland, which is a different thing, it’s working with material. I’m doing a poster design for a gallery located in Northern Holland. In fact, I just finished it last week, but I know there is a next one so I’ve started experimenting. This is something I do for free and I really enjoy. They always give me nice reviews. Of course, in between I make a diploma for students, and I’m working on logos for some individuals. So there are lot of stuff going on…
You work a lot. Can you stop working at some point? I’m asking because you’ve also said during your lecture that you do repetitious work in your free time.Yes, but I love watching TV as well. For the first 5 years I was working non-stop, later I realised there’ll always be work so it’s okay to take a break, it’s very normal to have weekends. There was a short period during the crisis when I was getting less money so I could not hire people and I was working during weekends, but I’m back on track now.
And finally, how do you like Budapest?For me it’s a cultural shock. I was just getting on the plane as it was taking a train to another city in Holland but getting out of the plane I had to realise this is not Holland. I didn’t really have time to think about being here, though. Today I was walking around, and first you go to the tourist layer and looking all the windows, but then I was taken to the House of Terror, which, of course, changes perspectives. You get the contrast between all the beautiful, decorated ceilings you could see in the buildings and this horrible history… And you meet nice people as well. I’ve been here for 30 hours maybe so I cannot say so much but it’s very intriguing.
You should come back later on!I’m going to treat my mother on a weeklong holiday in Budapest. I’m just thinking of stuff what we should do.
By the way, do you know anything about Hungarian graphic design?Only what I’ve seen on Graphifest, and, of course, I’be been looking around in the city as for graphic design it’s very important to get a platform, a space to show design. I’m just wondering what the operation spaces of Hungarian designers are.
They usually open a studio…Yes, but I mean in the street. I’ve seen posters but I don’t think those are designed by those people. Maybe different types of agencies…
There is an exhibition called ARC that has a theme every year, for instance.Yes, but for me exhibitions are designs for designers, however, designers should also meet clients who will hire them. Right now my problem is who will hire me, I might be invited to more exhibitions than for work. It’s lovely that people appreciate what you are doing and want to hang and show your work to other people but you need to make a living as well.
Do you think it should be offline, I’m just wondering, because you can be hired based on your portfolio on Behance/website, for example?I think your work should be everywhere. I’m on Cargo Collective because it has a gallery system so every time I do something I can put them in the front row. I get clients from there, and also from Instagram.
I don’t know how people did it before because when I graduated there was no Facebook or Tumblr, people did have websites but I have no idea how they did it. There were a lot of requests for portfolio books, though. There was always a book being published, and an art director called you that he/she wanted you in that book. Exposure is very important. I also have friends and colleagues who have maximum exposures but no paid assignments. So they get invited to Japan, for example, but nobody calling them saying: “Hello, we have some money, can you create something for us?” It would be nice to be found by an agent or something. I can see on Instagram that an agency is following me and I’m thinking: Oh, interesting, maybe they want me.

Reading scripts. Absolutely critical to learn the craft of screenwriting. The focus of this weekly series is a deep structural and thematic analysis of each script we read. Our daily schedule:
Monday: Scene-By-Scene BreakdownTuesday: Major Plot PointsWednesday: SequencesThursday: Psychological JourneyFriday: Takeaways
Today: Major Plot Points.
In every scene, something happens. A plot point is a scene or group of scenes in which something major happens, an event that impacts the narrative causing it to turn in a new direction.
A relevant anecdote. Years ago, I was on the phone with a writer discussing a script project. My son Will, who was about four years old at the time, must have been listening to me talking about “plot points” during the conversation because after I hung up, he asked, “Daddy, what’s a plop point?”
That’s in effect what a plot point is. It’s an event that ‘plops’ into the narrative and changes its course. So when you think Plot Point, think Plop Point!
The value of this exercise:
* To identify the backbone of the story structure.
* To examine each major plot point and see how it is effective as an individual event.
* To analyze the major plot points in aggregate to determine why they work together as the central plot.
This week: The Grand Budapest Hotel. You may download the script — free and legal — here: The Grand Budapest Hotel.
Screenplay by Wes Anderson, story by Wes Anderson & Hugo Guinness, inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig
IMDb plot summary: The adventures of Gustave H, a legendary concierge at a famous hotel from the fictional Republic of Zubrowka between the first and second World Wars, and Zero Moustafa, the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend.
Writing Exercise: Go through the scene-by-scene breakdown of The Grand Budapest Hotel and identify the major plot points. Post your thoughts in comments and we’ll see if we can come up with a consensus.
For Part 1, to read the Scene-By-Scene Breakdown created by Rob Hoskins, go here.
Tomorrow we consider the script’s structure in terms of its sequences.
If you’d like a PDF of The Grand Budapest Hotel, script scene-by-scene breakdown, go here.
Major kudos to Rob Hoskins for doing this week’s breakdown.
Tomorrow: We focus on the sequences in the script.
This series started here and we have 26 volunteers to do scene-by-scene breakdowns of contemporary movie scripts. The scripts we have already analyzed are in italics.
American Hustle: Jon RaymondArgo: Nora BarryBarney’s Version: John MBelle: DaniMBeginners: AliBoyhood: Jacob JensenEnough Said: AliFlight: 14ShariFrankenwenie: Will KingFrozen: Christina SekerisGone Girl: NateKohler1Gravity: Matt DuriezHanna: John ArendsLincoln: pgronkLooper: erikledrewMoonrise Kingdom: Daniel BiglerMud: AlejandroParanorman: OhScottyPrisoners: Melinda Mahaffey IcdenShort Term 12: Carolina GroppaThe Artist: Traci Nell PetersonThe Grand Budapest Hotel: Rob HoskinsThe Social Network: Nick DykalThe Way Way Back: RickyWadjda: iamdanielWhiplash: Steven Broughton
If you’d like to participate and do a scene-by-scene breakdown yourself, please indicate which script in comments or email me. We are using scripts available on our site here. Note some of the 2014 scripts are now available there including Belle, Birdman, Boyhood, Calvary, Get On Up, Gone Girl, How To Train Your Dragon 2, Kill The Messenger, Locke, St. Vincent, The Boxtrolls, The Fault In Our Stars, The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Theory of Everything, and Wild.
For new volunteers and those who have already volunteered, but not sent me a breakdown yet, please do so as soon as possible. Thanks!
Circling back to where we started, reading scripts is hugely important. Analyzing them even more so. If you want to work in Hollywood as a writer, you need to develop your critical analytical skills. This is one way to do that.
So seize this opportunity and join in the conversation!
I hope to see you in comments about this week’s script: The Grand Budapest Hotel.Comment Archive

Budapest is Hungary’s capital and largest city. It is by far the most visited city in the country, with millions of tourists landing every year. It also happens to be one of my most favorite cities. That being said, I am a traveler and not a tourist.
As such, every time I plan to travel, the idea is to go beyond the usual. In the case of Hungary, it is no different. Every occasion I venture out to this beautiful European country, I behave very unlike me. I make at least a couple of impromptu decisions during every vacation, and this attitude has helped me explore a lot of the country. This trip was no different.
For starters, on this occasion, I had not landed in Budapest and planned further. Instead, I was on my way to the hitherto unexplored western part of Hungary, having flown in to neighboring Austria. While I landed at Vienna, it was not going to be my base for the next few days. On the contrary, I had towards Sopron.
In the eight days that followed, I ended up exploring Sopron, Szombathely, Kőszeg and the surrounding countryside in the Győr-Moson-Sopron County and the Vas County. All the cities I ended up visiting also have a German name. So it is Ödenburg for Sopron…

I’m well aware that we don’t all rewatch films at the same time. We are all subject to individual whims that diverge and intersect largely at random. That said, I do think that in the near future many of us will be rewatching Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel.
This prediction is based on several factors: the impending release of Anderson’s new film The Phoenician Scheme, a renewed (or perhaps wholly original) fondness for Ralph Fiennes following his performance in Conclave, and the general critical consensus that The Grand Budapest Hotel represents the culmination of Anderson’s artistic vision. Essentially, if we’re due for a Wes Anderson rewatch, this will be the film a good 75–80% of participants will pick.
It’s my belief that when people do return to it, they’ll find the same thing I found during my recent rewatch. It’s better now than it was the first time. Why? Because time is a flat circle and our moral dilemmas have a habit of resurfacing in new disguises.
Viewers noted from the film’s release that one of its key themes was the rise of fascism. What I think we lacked in 2014 was an understanding of fascism as a recurring threat rather than one that was just as much an article of the past as the Grand Budapest itself. Sure, we could link the film’s commentary on the treatment of immigrants to ongoing crises in the world, but we didn’t see fascist militaries boarding trains and demanding visas. We saw… logistical challenges.
This political inattentiveness at the time of the film’s release contributed to a chronic misinterpretation of the two protagonists. Primarily, critics were prone to forgetting there were, in fact, two protagonists.
Readers may have noticed my use of the pronoun “we” up to this point when making my points. The “we” I am referring to are fellow white beneficiaries of the imperial core. To those reading who do not fit into that category, my apologies, but you’ll see the utility in a moment.
Our greatest failing when initially addressing The Grand Budapest Hotel at the time of its release, was to center our attentions almost entirely on M. Gustave for analysis. He is by all means a fascinating character with many aspects to pick apart and discuss; however, his function in the narrative is to serve as a catalyst and foil for our true central character, Zero.
The Grand Budapest Hotel is presented in layers, a trick Anderson has become quite fond of if his more recent film Asteroid City is any indication. The film opens on a young girl reading a book next to the grave of the book’s author, who awaits us in the next layer to detail a story from his youth, where in the next layer he meets with the aging proprietor of a hotel far past its prime situated in the fictional alpine nation of Zubrowka, and in the final layer where most of the film takes place, the proprietor recounts his time as a lobby boy at the hotel. By all accounts, the narrator and arbiter of style for most of the film is Zero (or at least the image of Zero his older self conveys to the author).
Like many of Anderson’s films, this one concerns itself with nostalgia for bygone eras. This nostalgia textures the memory of previous times to such a degree that they become more of a fantastical setting than a true reflection of the past, putting a pair of rose-tinted glasses on for the audience. Against the backdrop of a pastel 1930s Europe, we’re confronted with a group of characters who deliberately clash with it. While the staff of The Grand Budapest and the other members of the Society of Crossed Keys all stand out with vivid color, they are contrasted by the setting’s rising fascist movement dressed entirely in monochrome.
A common criticism I’ve found of Anderson’s work is that he prioritizes style over substance, that his chief concern is the aesthetic coherence of an auteur rather than the merit of his narratives. While in some cases this may be fair, what my rewatch of The Grand Budapest Hotel illustrated for me is that to measure style against substance is to create a false dichotomy. That is because, in this film style elucidates substance, substance that in 2014 we were perhaps less primed to recognize.
The rosiness of The Grand Budapest’s past and the whimsical absurdity of its inhabitants are the product of Zero’s recollection, because at this point in his life the hotel may as well be a fairyland compared to what came before. We learn later in the film, following a frustrated outburst from Gustave that gives way to a host of xenophobic insults, that Zero came to Zubrowka from an unnamed Arab country going through a state of political turmoil. He fled after witnessing the execution of his entire family and the lingering threat from the encroaching fascist army will mean death for him, should they choose to deport him.
While most reviews of the film at its release were positive, the few notable criticisms were leveled against the plot, some saying it felt nonsensical and unconnected to any broader theme. And when you view the film with Gustave as its true protagonist, the criticism makes sense. However, when you consider the film from Zero’s perspective, there’s an obvious logic as to why he would focus on patently silly events and madcap drama. To him, these are the good times. Times when he had his mentor and wife with him, when the fascists were a distant presence that only occasionally menaced him, and he had a home that filled him with a sense of purpose. This is the story he wishes to tell.
In the narrative layer where he speaks with the author, the now dilapidated Grand Budapest is the last vestige of that former life Zero still possesses. He explains that he maintains it not in memory of Gustave, who embodied the hotel’s spirit and ultimately bequeathed it to him, but in memory of his wife Agatha. This was the place they were happy together, however short that time may have been. The utility of memory is such that by sharing it we allow ourselves to be better understood.
We made the mistake of assuming fascism was included in the movie to emphasize that theme of memory, that is was a thing of the past that poked a hole in an otherwise happy period, but we also presumed that the only associations with it that mattered are our own. It is easier for us to relate to Gustave, because like him, our confrontations with fascist oppression are taken on by choice. Even with the added context that some of us, like Gustave, are queer and have that as a potential target on our backs, our existences are not constantly hounded by fascist dogma in the same way those of immigrants and refugees are.
While Zero’s growth over the course of the film is defined by him establishing himself as an integral part of the Grand Budapest’s community, Gustave’s arc centers his developing awareness of his own privilege and the value of his relationships with others. He comes to understand that there are ways to relate to others beyond providing a service.
The scene that I find most striking ten years later is a scene shot entirely in monochrome. It is an echo of an earlier scene and an escalation of the film’s color language. The fascist army boards the train and enters the train car occupied by Gustave, Zero, and Zero’s wife Agatha. They request the travelers’ papers, though this time with a heavier threat hanging over their heads should they produce the wrong kind of papers. Zero pulls out a wrinkled and ripped work visa, which Gustave confirms the legitimacy of and even produces a card from a commander in the fascist army indicating they should be allowed to pass. The fascist army members do not accept this. And Gustave, as the author is told by an older Zero, gave his life trying to ensure Zero’s safe passage. What precisely happened to Zero and Agatha in the two years between Gustave’s death and the death of Agatha and her child is left ambiguous, but one can presume they were not happy times.
It is easy for things to become commonplace which would have been unthinkable just a few years prior. We now live in a version of the US confident in its power to harass, detain, and deport immigrants on a whim. We have people boarding our trains and asking for our documents at this very moment. What The Grand Budapest Hotel wants us to realize is that we have a duty to the person sitting next to us. It can be easy to allow injustices to pass us by due to relative distance, to cling to a veneer of civility and not make a fuss.
Perhaps the most insidious misinterpretation of the film is that Gustave is a good man because of his civility, that his politeness brings him karmic rewards because he does not discriminate in who he is polite to. The aforementioned scene refutes this assertion, bookmarked in black and white so the audience takes care to remember. Gustave was a good man because he knew when to take action, and he gained that knowledge through his friendship with Zero. If his strength is his civility, then true civility must include a refusal to sit by and allow harm to come to the people around you.
The Grand Budapest Hotel is a better film now in 2025 than it was at release, because present political circumstances make it far more difficult for us to miss the point. Zero was always the heart of the story, his attachment to the hotel always in relation to how it provided a home for him rather than a vocation. It is only now that we begin to develop the consciousness to understand these things outside of our own privileged experience. It is no longer possible to ignore.
We feel the weight of the world of memory Anderson presents more keenly now because we have lost the benefit of distance from the time it represents.

They say there are two types of people in Budapest, those who live in Buda and those who want to live in Buda.
Well, after my first trip to this stunning city with my high school best friend, Kat, I can see why. Buda, with its rolling hills and picturesque skyline, is undeniably the prettier side of the Danube, but I quickly fell for both Buda and Pest.
There’s a certain magic to the way the two sides blend, separated by the wide, winding river but bound together by history and charm.
From the moment we arrived, we were swept up in Budapest’s grandeur. The architecture alone felt like it was trying to impress us. It succeeded. Every street corner seemed to shout, “Look at me! I’m outrageously elegant!” with good reason.
The city is a feast for the eyes, with its majestic buildings, intricate monuments, and statues that could rival those in any European capital.

I was following our tour guide through Budapest’s Liberty Square when he stopped the group and pointed to a larger-than-life bronze statue. “Do you know who this is?”
We shuffled closer, and I gasped. “Ronald Reagan? You have a statue of Ronald Reagan in your capitol?”
My next question echoed what many of us were thinking. “Why?”
The tour guide beamed. “Hungarians believe Ronald Reagan had a lot to do with the fall of Communism in our country. His famous words, ‘Take down that wall,’ started the whole thing rolling.”
The guide continued, “There are many who believe his economic policies led to the downfall of the Soviet Union. The people wanted to show their appreciation for your former president’s efforts in ending the Cold War.”
As I spent more time in Budapest, I noticed a recurring theme. The Hungarians felt oppressed and stripped of their rights when the Soviet Union controlled their country, and feelings…

🏩✨A number of years ago, upon writing this review, we had decided to spend the tenth day of August in the spa town of Nebelsbad below the Alpine Sudetenwaltz — and had taken up rooms in the Grand Budapest — a picturesque, elaborate, and a still widely-celebrated establishment. 🗓📝🏔We expect some of you will know it. 🌸🎟
After boarding the LFC Express, we have finally arrived at our destination: The Grand Budapest Hotel, with the Buda-best service, Mr. Gustave- approved! Read our review as we reminisce on this classic cinematic masterpiece!

Wes Anderson’s ‘The Grand Budapest Hotel’ is well positioned to win some Oscars on Sunday. It received nine Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Picture. The film’s editing has received widespread praise and Editor Barney Pilling is nominated in that category (his first Oscar nomination). Pilling’s work on ‘Budapest’ also recently won him an ACE Eddie Award for Best Edited Feature, Comedy/Musical. Pilling’s past projects include ‘An Education,’ ‘Never Let Me Go,’ and ‘One Day.’ He’s currently working on ‘Suffragette’ starring Meryl Streep and Helena Bonham Carter.
Here’s our Q&A on ‘The Grand Budapest Hotel’:
What inspired you to become an editor?
I’ve always loved watching films throughout my life and I’ve always had a creative drive…but I’d have to say that the sci-fi and war films of my childhood really fired my imagination in a way that little else did and probably set the foundation for a life of make-believe. ‘Star Wars,’ Spielberg, ‘Bladerunner,’ ‘2001 A Space Odyssey,’ ‘Alien,’ ‘Guns of Navarone,’ ‘Where Eagles Dare,’ ‘Bridge on the River Kwai’ and so on.
What’s it like to work on a Wes Anderson film?
It’s incredibly hard work and truly exhilarating, all at the same time! It’s also a privilege for me to work with so many outstanding craftspeople and performers.
What were the biggest challenges with editing the film?
Probably pulling in so many elements from so many different sources, studios and countries for the action pieces. We had green screen main unit, miniature model and landscape builds in Berlin, stop motion puppetry happening in London, and Look FX tinkering away in LA — so pulling all this into focus with the right rhythm was a long and tough process. Also technically really demanding of the editorial team and the Avid Software — many, many video layers!
Both you and your wife are in the business. Do you discuss work at home?
Yes! Lots. It’s hard not too. You have to be very passionate about what you are doing to succeed in the TV and Film industry, so it’s difficult to switch it off at home. Also, we end up being first audiences of our respective projects — bouncing things off each other — it’s nice.
Could you see yourself working with Wes Anderson again?
I hope so! I’m incredibly proud of the work we all did on that ‘Grand Budapest Hotel’ and have become close friends with many of my fellow craftspeople. These are feelings and relationships that of course anyone would want to repeat or perpetuate.

I have been pretty inactive on social media in the past few weeks because my phone was stolen while I was traveling in Budapest, Hungary. Losing your phone is very inconvenient in this day and age, when so much activity and business has moved to mobile platforms. Not having Google maps in my palm made navigation a bit more cumbersome, and many of my plane tickets and travel information were on my phone. I also couldn’t look up different restaurants to go and compare the reviews. Worst of all, I was cut off from the rest of the world as I couldn’t access my emails, texts, phone calls, social media, etc.
My first impression of Budapest was very positive. I liked how traditional Budapest is compared to other big cities in Europe, and the Hungarian culture is alive and thriving in this city. Many of the restaurants were over a hundred years old, serving traditional Hungarian cuisine the same way they had for centuries. There was a wide variety of meats, including goose, venison (deer meat), wild boar, duck, rabbit, etc., which I really appreciated because those types of meats are relatively rare in America and Western Europe, where people usually just eat chicken, beef, or pork for their protein. Moreover, prices in general were a lot lower in Budapest, although the exchange rate was pretty confusing because 1 US dollar is almost 300 Hungarian Forints (289.22 as of July 14, 2019). I…

October has always been my favorite month, filled with happiness, and fun, and began of the festival. But this October, we planned to do something different, So We decided to take our vacation to Budapest. We did not take a single vacation break this year which made us do something different, to feel like we did something this year apart from work or regular life.
Budapest the capital city of Hungary, is a town rich with history, beautiful breathtaking architecture, and unforgettable experiences.
But this trip was different from any other trip we had before because we ticked off one of the most thrilling items on our bucket list: skydiving.
I’ve always been drawn to the idea of flying, but nothing could prepare me for the rush of actually leaping from a plane at 10,000 feet. The sensation was beyond words. Budapest, with its stunning landscapes, became the perfect backdrop for…

We were awakened in the middle of the night on our European River Cruise by a loud noise, a shaking of the boat from left to right and back to left again, and the closet light flashing on and off as the door spontaneously opened and banged shut.
“What was that?” I asked my husband as I grabbed his arm. He looked out our glassed-in French Balcony. “We’re in a lock,” he said. “The boat must have hit the side of it.”
Within minutes, we were back to sleep. We had our safety drill early in the trip and no sirens went off nor was any announcement made — whatever it was, lock or no lock, we were safe.
When we planned our vacation traversing Europe on three iconic rivers — the Danube, Rhine, and Main — we had no idea we’d pass through so many locks.

Wes Anderson’s “The Grand Budapest Hotel” is colorful, quirky and almost surreal.
Behind Anderson’s detailed world is Marquette alumnus Adam Stockhausen, Comm ‘95.
Director Wes Anderson and Stockhausen looked at old hotels and other eastern European buildings to create the invented country of Zubrowka.
“The Grand Budapest Hotel” received nine Oscar nominations and won four of them.
Stockhausen took home his first Oscar for production design. He shares this award with set designer Anna Pinnock.
m.jsonline.com
He graduated from Marquette in 1995 with a degree in theater.
“He has that ability to wrap his mind around stuff and to get so engrossed in things that it really turns out some wonderful stuff,” Marquette Theatre Artistic director Debra Krajec told Fox6 News.
Stockhausen is the first Marquette graduate to win an Academy Award since Dom Ameche won for Best Supporting Actor in 1986.
Stochkausen was previously nominated for his work in the 2012 film “12 Years a Slave.” He has already worked on two films since “The Grand Budapest Hotel.”

The city smelled of days’ worn clothes. Streets are littered with piss stains, cigarette butts and small piles of dog shit. Budapest features a rich history, the majesty of time immemorial is written into ornate buildings riddled with bullet holes, and in somber pockmarked faces of passerbys. Ambulances in a foreign language squeal in the distance, like a whining dog. Trams charge up and murmur in electric tongues. Dark-haired people with thin lips and absent eyes mix into the landscape.
I get the sense of an underlying hardship, that people are struggling (later confirmed by talking with locals). Maybe it’s winter malady, absent of snow and joy. The only people laughing loudly are the tourists, who are everywhere; Flaunting their unburdened spirit, unbridled by work or school or obligations (here on holiday for cheap thrills). To walk down the sidewalk is to island hop between unrecognizable dialects. You know a tourist by: Loud chittering dispersed amid large flocks with cocked heads; raised eyes and abrupt stops to review digital maps; movement that is too fast or slow for the pace of the street.
I’m not sure what I was looking for in my trip, and I wouldn’t say that I’ve “learned about myself” or “grown” per se. I would like to continue streaking away from a traditional career in America; I want to let go of the rope on the bunny slope. I don’t desire being different as a matter of course, but simply following others is not the way towards individuation.
I do seek: Authenticity. As Dōgen, a Japanese Buddhist priest, writer, poet, philosopher, and founder of the Sōtō school of Zen in Japan, said, “We study the self to forget the self. When you forget the self, you can become one with the ten thousand things.” And as the Buddah proclaimed, “kill the Buddah.” Or, your ultimate goal is to make your own way. Guides, inspiration, models offer signposts, but the landscape is vast and inherently unique for each person; I intend to get off the trail, even if I need to come back and follow the blazes from time to time.
Towards the end of his life, Carl Jung stated that our greatest adventure today is in the exploration of our unconscious. Everything else is a distraction; to know ourselves is more important, meaningful, and challenging than say, colonizing Mars — while I appreciate the pursuit it seems more like an act of running away from the real meaning here on Earth (and from within ourselves).
In the Western world, we live in a culture of (inter-)connection in the form of: sociability and social networks; emails and Twitter streams; a prizing of extraversion; boredom and distraction. And yet loneliness is both ubiquitous and a condemnation. Jung would classify this as the Shadow of our collective Ego, because consciousness exists for individuals and societies, and we are very good at denying ourselves and each other at scale. To deny your Self is to empower the Shadow, which is the root for maladies of the human personality.
Tidying things up: In a world with excess information most of us are sponges, super-saturated with no spare volume for our own understanding… what would happen if we were all suddenly wrung dry?

Wes Anderson’s “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” released in 2014, is a cinematic masterpiece that defies categorization. With its distinctive visual style, quirky characters, and intricate narrative structure, the film takes audiences on a whimsical journey through a world that is both charmingly surreal and emotionally resonant. As a testament to Anderson’s unique directorial vision, “The Grand Budapest Hotel” has left an indelible mark on the world of cinema.
A Visual Delight
From the moment the film begins, viewers are enveloped in a visually enchanting universe that could only have sprung from the mind of Wes Anderson. The movie’s meticulously crafted set designs, intricate color palettes, and meticulously arranged compositions create a mesmerizing experience. The Grand Budapest Hotel itself, with its pink façade and ornate interiors, serves as both a central character and a metaphor for the film’s whimsical allure.
Anderson’s keen attention to detail extends beyond the set design. The use of miniatures and practical effects adds a layer of tangible magic to the story, transporting the audience to a realm that feels both nostalgic and otherworldly. Each frame is a work of art, and the film’s distinctive visual style is as much a character as any of the actors.
An Ensemble of Eccentric Characters
At the heart of “The Grand Budapest Hotel” is an ensemble cast that brings the film’s eccentric characters to life with remarkable depth and charisma. The inimitable Ralph Fiennes leads the pack as the charismatic and witty concierge, Monsieur Gustave H. His magnetic performance adds a layer of charm and complexity to the character, making him simultaneously hilarious and heartwarming.
The supporting cast is equally impressive, with memorable performances from Saoirse Ronan, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Tilda Swinton, Jeff Goldblum, and many others. Each character, no matter how minor, contributes to the film’s rich tapestry, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.
A Narrative Maze
What sets “The Grand Budapest Hotel” apart is its intricate narrative structure. The film unfolds as a story within a story within a story, skillfully weaving together different timelines and perspectives. This layered approach not only keeps the audience engaged but also deepens the emotional resonance of the film.
The narrative structure is further enhanced by the film’s playful tone and dark humor. Anderson effortlessly transitions between moments of slapstick comedy and poignant introspection, creating a balance that keeps the audience emotionally invested while never taking itself too seriously.
Themes of Nostalgia and Loss
Beneath the film’s whimsy and humor lies a profound exploration of themes such as nostalgia, loss, and the passage of time. Through the character of Zero Moustafa (played by F. Murray Abraham and Tony Revolori), the audience witnesses the changing landscape of Europe and the hotel’s decline from its glamorous heyday. This melancholic undercurrent adds depth to the film, reminding us that even the most fantastical worlds are not immune to the effects of time.
Conclusion
“The Grand Budapest Hotel” is a cinematic gem that continues to captivate audiences with its unique blend of visual artistry, quirky characters, and intricate storytelling. Wes Anderson’s directorial vision shines through in every frame, creating a world that feels simultaneously nostalgic and fresh. The film’s ability to evoke laughter, wonder, and introspection is a testament to its enduring appeal. As we revisit the charming corridors of the Grand Budapest Hotel, we are reminded that, in the world of cinema, true magic knows no bounds.

A book that made me book a flight to Budapest. I guess it was one of the best decisions. Right now, crying here in “Vinikli” while enjoying Hungarian wine, still feeling so happy that I am here. Thank you Magda Szabó.
Oh, my heart. This book is why I’m sitting here in Budapest, crying my eyes out as I read the final pages. What a story… my heart is shattered into pieces. My dear Etelka. My dear Iza.
My journey with Hungarian literature began with Sándor Márai’s Portraits of a Marriage, which remains one of my favorite books. But this one, written by the talented Magda Szabó, is just as incredible. Reading the final pages in the very place where it all unfolded is truly a magical experience.
In Etelka, I saw so much of my own mother, and in the things Iza did thinking she was helping her mother, but slowly, unintentionally causing her to wither like a flower, I unfortunately found myself in her.
After my family lost their first child, perhaps because I am the only child my family had later in life, I empathized with the book deeply — I’m not sure — but it touched me profoundly. I felt an incredible sense of regret for every time I was unsympathetic toward my mother. At the same time, just like Etelka, Iza’s life was also changed, and I can truly relate to the turmoil and confusion she went…

Budapest is the capital and this was my second time here. This time the stay was in Hotel Danubius Helia at the Karpat Utca, on the banks of river Danubius. You get a view of Margaret island from the hotel rooms. I visited the island on the Day 1 evening, people usually go there for jogging, having alcohol at the restaurant, watching the ruins. There is also a presedved bio diversity, a few animals kept in there covered from all sides.
I took a walking tour on the second day and they take you through: the Parliament, American Embassy, Heroes square, Ruin Bars, the Jewish synagogue
Its a very small country in the Central Europe, part of which also meets the Adriatic Sea in the south. Almost any part can be reached in a couple of hours from the capital: Ljubljana. If compared, the country must be smaller than Indian state Madhya Pradesh.
Unlike rest of the European countries, the capital doesn’t have Tram trains and Subways as public transport. You can only use the local buses. In fact if you’re a tourist, every tourist spot can be covered by walk. Its all within a square kilometer from the main bus station. Preseren Square, Ljubljana castle, Dragon Bridge, National & University Library, Restaurants, Market are the only places that can be visited or are a must visit. You won’t find Starbucks, Subway, KFC et cetera here in the capital. Luckily, we have McD, Pizza Hut, at least for the Vegetarians.
25 minutes of walk to the castle, mostly climbing, you get a very beautiful view of the city from the top. There are multiple entries and exits at the bottom where you can start your climbing. You can also take a Funicular railway for a return ticket of 6 Euros, to avoid walking. I preferred walking because thats what I’ve been doing since last 6 days perhaps to save a few Euros for the remaining tour. I’ve started liking to walk (a lot) now a days. You’ll see a bunch of private restaurants, pretty costly too, on the top part of the castle. This part, privatization at the world heritage sites, I really hate it.
Bled is a beautiful town 55 kimoleters away from the capital. Arriva is the transport company here which takes you there with a good frequency of buses, for every half an hour, charging 13 Euros for return. I had planned for only 1 day for Bled unknowing of its charm. One can spend like a week here if you plan to see it thoroughly. There’s a lake in the middle of the town with a small island which has a church. People usually take local ferries to reach there, the charge is 15 Euros for return. Its a wooden boat and the person ferrying us has to row using the oars in both hands, sounds like bit of a stamina work, right? To add to that, there were around 16 people on the boat.
Vintgar Klamm is a place from where you can start your walk through gorge, to the waterfall alongside the picturesque Radovna river. 2 Euros for a return ticket by bus from Bled and about 30 minutes to reach.
Its a beautiful walk with cold breezes and lushy green forest. You can also go near the water, drink it, sit there for some time unless you are making any risky move.
For solo travellers or not tourists, who do not want to spend a lot on stay, I would suggest booking Turn Hostel in Mala Ulica near the main bus station which is 5 minutes walking distance. They charge around 25 Euros per night plus 3 Euros environment tax. Also all tourist places in Ljubljana are at a walking distance.
After the beautiful trip of Slovenia, I then took a bus from the main bus station of Ljubljana to Marburg where I’ll be meeting my brother in law. It was a 17 hours of journey by Bus, I had booked a Flixbus through their app, it costed me 53 Euros. The bus was scheduled at 21:05.
The bus was a double decker Flixbus and it was running late by an hour as it had started from Zagreb. To my surprise, Buses in Europe run late too. I hadn’t booked a specific seat number, so boarded and searched for the best available seat for me on the upper half. It doesn’t matter to be seated in last seats in European countries as the roads and speed breakers are smooth enough. More importantly, buses are comparatively comfortable too. I got a window seat exactly above the rear tyre set. It was a semi sleeper and the journey was for the entire night. Phew!!
It reached on time to the Frankfurt bus station at around 9:00 am and I had a connecting bus at 11:00 am to Marburg. I walked in to a nearby hotel to enquire for using the washroom. 1 Euro was the charge. I quickly refreshed myself, enquired for the coffee at the reception but unfortunately they didn’t serve only coffee, I needed to take the entire buffet which I was not in the mood to. I decoded to take a walk around the bus station, it was a big place, with many shops, hotels, tram stations et cetera. I could even see an Indian restaurant across the road, but it would only open after I take my bus to Marburg.
“I don’t know where I’m going but I’m on my way”
Trip Route:
Mumbai — Vienna — Budapest — Ljubljana — Bled — Ljubljana— Marburg — Munich — Vienna — Mumbai

UPDATE: This is a fairly old article, since the 2015 instagram update various aspect ratios are allowed to upload, from 1.91:1 to 1:1 hooray for cinematographers and directors like Reed Morano or Emmanuel Lubezki. But that doesn’t mean this article is of no use, all the contrary, the quick lessons within still apply if you want to give that somewhat classic look to your instagram account, much better if you like the squared ratio photos, like many photographers of the minimalist style wave do.
Those who saw “The Grand Budapest Hotel” can agree with me that it was marvelous in many aspects: Oscar worthy direction, scenarios, music and many others. But for now, i’m writing about his cinematography/ photography direction by the hand of Robert D. Yeoman and how he and the movie can make you a better instagrammer.
When I just finished watching it for the first time, at the moment the credits were rolling I realized that the movie itself is, in a way, an awesome and inspiring example of Instagram photography.
The frames were composed with such taste and detail that the first thing I say to my friends about the movie is that “It’s visually incredible”; and perhaps, some part of that beauty it’s because of the unusual (almost squared) 1.37:1 aspect ratio used on most of the length of the film.
That unusual look gave the movie that 30's vintage film look that I found absolutely beautiful and, in fact, it’s very Instagram-like.
Note that Instagram uses a 1:1 Squared aspect ratio, not 1.37:1, but between 1.37:1 and 1:1 there isn’t a lot difference.
The following are some examples of the key aspects I was able to absorb from the movie.
The Grand Budapest Hotel teaches us that keeping in mind the frame when composing is the key, every line, every element and just about everything is in the tone and fits perfectly on his aspect ratio. (look at the courtains in the example or the columns in the first picture)
One of the primary reasons that most people post bad photos on Instagram is that they not compose their photos thinking “squared”, they aren’t thinking in 1:1 ratio, some people just take the pictures, as usual, in the aspect ratio the camera app is set (usually 2:3 or 16:9), forgetting the composition, and later they crop the photo in Instagram, well, that’s a mistake. Use an app like VSCO cam, the square guide feature within the app is meant for Instagram users, it helps a lot.
“Always think 1:1”
It’s all about giving your subject his space, the movie does this perfectly, sometimes with flat backgrounds, brighter backgrounds and not making the subject to absorb the entire frame.
Make it simple
Sometimes there will be a trashcan or a chair that will come out on your way, disbalancing your shot, and the best way to treat this is simply moving them away to have a better and cleaner composition. Or you can incorporate them to become a part of your shot, as I explain in the next point.
One thing I found curious, specially in this shot, is the fact that all the elements in the movie are in a certain position and place that it almost feels painted.
The movie with that single shot tells us a story, some kind of manhunt or investigation. Well, that’s what a great photo achieves, to make the public imagine the reason of every element on the shot.
Tell a story with your elements
Just arrange the objects to give balance to your shot. And as the example shot shows: A little dramatic light always help.
This is actually very trendy among the photography and design community, but i’m not aware of the name of the trend, if you know it please leave me a note →
This one is the key aspect to make your photos look like the work of a pro (while you become one). The movie gave special attention to achieve symmetry to their shots. Perhaps that’s the main aspect I loved about The Grand Budapest Hotel (visually speaking), and the reason that lead me to write this article.
Make your shot stable, be sure your camera is completely vertical or horizontal and look for guides to help you give symmetry to your shot (Look at how the black tiles at the example helps to center the shot.)
Take your time
I suggest not to tilt your photos. I’ve seen very few pics on Instagram that work with a tilted crooked angle, the 1:1 aspect ratio pairs better with a flat horizon line. So, unless you’re absolutely conviced that the tilted angle will work, try to avoid it.The symmetry is the best friend of the aspect I explain next.
This is the ultimate “cheat” to make your squared Instagram photos look awesome. The cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman without a doubt loves the perspectives and we have the joy to experience many scenes like this one in the movie. (Similar to the Stanley Kubrick style)
This style draws your attention into the picture, creates movement in it and, virtually commands you to pay attention to the subject.
Give movement to your shot
The lines are everything. Take the example shot as a simple guide. Corridors, bridges or train tracks are ideal scenarios; make your perspective lines go to the corners of the frame, make it symmetrical (as I explained in the previous point); put one main subject at the center of the frame (max two subjects); and simply enjoy the moment. You’ll see the results. Your photos are gonna get a lot of ❤ on Instagram.
Now it’s up to you. Watch the movie, get inspired, follow this path and start shooting, you’re gonna love all of it.
Please, don’t get me wrong, i’m not saying this is the only way to shine at Instagram, but it’s certainly a beautiful path.
Here are some real examples of successful instagrammers of this style, follow them for an extra dose of inspiration. I II III IV V (I love the third one)
Thank you for reading!
This is my very first article and if you recommend it that will mean a lot to me. Let me know if you liked it. ☺Apologies if something is misspelled, I’m not very fluent at english.Share this article wherever you like. Thanks.

Despite our frequent squabbles, my teenage daughter approached me in October with travel plans for Fall break that felt more like a polished closing argument in a presidential debate. She artfully outlined her reasons for the trip, highlighted how it could strengthen our bond, and delivered a persuasive appeal for me to step away from my relentless 9-to-5 grind — stirring a sense of intrigue and the promise of much-needed relaxation.
It left a mark that lingered in my thoughts, pulling me in until I finally gave in.
A few weeks later, we were soaring above the clouds, Budapest-bound, carried by the thrill of reconnecting with old friends.
We touched down just past midnight, stepping into Budapest’s deserted streets, where every shadow seemed to echo the 12 years, I once called this city home. Meanwhile, I rehearsed the apartment code like a sacred verse, fearing my dead phone would turn this arrival into a pilgrimage of memory.

In Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel, the moments of absurdity are essential to understanding the humanity of the story and how our relationships with others are what defines our lives. Anderson is sure to never spend too long on one tragic moment alone and tends to bundle emotion, comedy, and danger together in a scene. These moments of comedy act as a device to distance the viewer from the dark realities of the story and are key to making the film enjoyable instead of altogether sad.
From the moment the film starts, we are distanced from the story. We see a young girl visit a tribute to the author of our tale, who then discusses the true story of his book as it was told to him by Zero in his later years. We are quickly aware of the lenses we are seeing the story through and the fact that it is a story. It is through the form of a story that we can pay attention to the greater themes that are discussed about the world and the relationships that develop.
When Gustave receives news of Madame D., he immediately heads off to the funeral, and abruptly takes Zero with him. “We must go to her.” “We must?” “She needs me, and I need you to help me with my bags and so on.” Although this is the way in which he asks Zero to go with him and has him pack wine and his bag for him, it becomes clear that Gustave wants to have someone by his side. Like Zero, Gustave is alone in this world and has no one else that he would trust to go with him. Gustave clearly feels a strong bond with Zero early on and treats him as a friend once they are outside the hotel, but Zero does not feel that same way immediately. Gustave pours him wine (which Zero does not drink) and plans that if things were to go south, they should run away together. Gustave even chooses Zero as his heir to his estate when he is gone. Zero is the closest thing that Gustave has to family and the hotel is the closest thing either of them has to a home. He admits to Zero (on Madame D’s death), “I blame myself. She tried to warn me…but I didn’t listen…There’s really no point to doing anything in life because it’s all gone in the blink of an eye.” This is a truly dreary perspective from Gustave that he counters with telling Zero how good she was in bed. They are then interrupted by the militiamen who enter the train and who Gustave tries to charm and joke with as he would with anyone else, to no avail. After they are assaulted when Zero’s papers are not in order, it is Gustave’s charm after all that saved them. Heckels telling Zero, “Your companion was very kind to me when I was just a lonely little boy,” showing Zero how, while his charms do not always work, Gustave can make a difference in people’s lives by treating them with care and respect. It is through their performance of careful care as hotel employees that they are both detached and closer than anyone else, and, by sharing this secret, Zero allows Gustave to be the closest thing to “real” that is possible.
When Gustave is arrested and in prison, he continues his role as concierge. Anderson highlights this role with the comedic lines of Gustave as he rolls his food cart past each of the cells, offering slop like it is fine cuisine; even salting it for a prisoner. He’s surrounded by hardened criminals and fighting, yet all he wants to do is make life as good for these people as he possibly can. He has Mendl’s smuggled in and shares it with his fellow prisoners, the group including Pinky who he got in an altercation with early on, the altercation itself showing that Gustave can break his act of charm when it suits him and that his desire for control is stronger than his facade. The group has even discussed that he’s “a real straight fellow,” and, “one of us now.” Gustave is delighted and surprised, as he is probably not thanked in the same way for his services in the hotel, as well as the fact that he is just treating the prisoners the way he would anyone else, likely seeing them in a very similar light, saying that even, “The most dreadful and unattractive person only needs to be loved and they will open up like a flower.” Living for the hotel and acting as a concierge are Gustave’s sole purposes in life and are why he does not let go of his duties even while behind bars, giving letters to Zero to read on his behalf to take care of the hotel the way that he would, even giving poems to recite just as he would to remind them that he and the hotel are one in the same. Gustave’s idea to have the digging tools smuggled in with the pastries, that the guard cannot bear to destroy, acts as a metaphor for the charms and kindness of Gustave being the only way to combat the brutishness and bad in the world.
When Gustave escapes through the sewer with the prisoners and meets with Zero, he is quite the opposite of his charming self and is in the shoes of the concierge as a boss and not as a companion. Zero has no disguises for them, no safe house and has not brought a bottle of l’air de panache for Gustave to freshen up with. While not essential to their plan, these things were all included in how Gustave would have done them himself had he been in control. This lack of authority in the moment and his distance from the hotel trigger him to go off on Zero. He condemns him for coming to Zubrowska as an immigrant, saying that if he does not know how to act that they’d be better off if he went back to where he came from. When Zero rebuts with the story of how his father and family were killed and how the violence of the war caused him to leave, Gustave realizes the error of his ways and apologizes, “On behalf of the hotel… Don’t make excuses for me. I owe you my life. You are my dear friend and protégé and I am very proud of you.” What seems to be a very low point of Gustave’s character has a sudden redemption arc when he realizes that these material things don’t matter at all if he hadn’t had Zero to help him. This is the turning point for Gustave seeing Zero as a friend or brother and the only relationship that truly matters to him. This moment is essential to the later scene where Gustave officiates Zero and Agatha’s wedding as well as Gustave’s final moments in the train car where all three have become a family and would fight for each other.
In all, The Grand Budapest Hotel acts as a tale of light within the darkness. It shows how stories of individuals and their relationships can make dire times appear much brighter. Anderson uses the bonds of Zero and Gustave, and later the addition of Agatha, to present a realistic portrayal of how life goes on when tragedy occurs and that all you can do is laugh and try to make the best of your situation. Anderson carefully weaves in the exaggeration of comedic situations and actions with the grim reality of Gustave being framed, people being murdered, and the government falling to a new regime in just a way that makes you think about what you’re watching and makes you question why you feel the way you do. Anderson’s narrative works because, before the viewer even realizes it, they are shown loyalty, love, war, and loss and are told to face it just as the characters are, head-on.

It was her fifth new date in as many weeks, and none of them had been a success. The men all appeared very attractive and almost perfect matches on the screen of her mobile phone. In real life, however, there was always something a bit off. Sometimes more than a bit.
Tonight, it was Jeff. Jeff had potential. Definitely handsome. Probably hadn’t lied about his age. Casual – both his outfit and his demeanour. It turned out his “college education” was a few months of online courses at a community college that had since closed down. He studied international hospitality but gave up when the family business needed his help. He now runs an industrial carpet cleaning firm. Pet odour removal is their specialty.
She’d been wondering if Jeff had noticed that her blazer was not freshly pressed. She’d convinced herself it wasn’t visible. Just to be on the safe side, though, she removed it after the appetiser. This manoeuvre put her full breasts on clear display, barely concealed by the cream-coloured dress she had chosen for the occasion.
Twenty-nine years old, chief researcher at a major pharmaceutical company, she was wondering what had gone wrong. Why did she have to drag herself to dates with strangers instead of curling up on the sofa in her cosy living room – book in one hand and a cabernet sauvignon in the other? Perhaps her father had been right. “You might as well move into a monastery. Just as likely you’ll meet someone there as locked up in your place.”
Jeff ventured into talking about politics just as the main course arrived. He sounded like he had rehearsed what he was saying, but his views were moderate, and for the most part, she found his points reasonable. Then his phone rang. He fished it out of his pocket, looked at the screen, and excused himself. She kept staring in front of her while he was gone, without touching the salmon on her plate.
When he returned, he sat, ran his fingers through his hair, and fidgeted with his shiny, oversized wristwatch.
Then he said, “Have I told you your nails are done beautifully?”

It was my husband’s 45th birthday in November 1989, and we went out to lunch.
I never went out to lunch. András and I never went out to lunch. There simply was no time in his life or in mine for such luxuries, but we did have reasons to celebrate — and plans to make.
The Berlin Wall had been crumbling for months before it came down that November. András had been watching the news with uncommon interest, both professionally, as a political scientist, and personally, as a boy who became a refugee when he and his family fled Soviet tanks during the 1956 Uprising.
His life was now full of teaching at Concordia University and consulting work; mine was filled with teaching at John Abbott College, publishing Matrix magazine, and editing fiction mss. for Véhicule Press. Both our lives were brimming over with our marriage, our three sons, our big house, a yellow Labrador named Hector, and our writing and research; I’d just finished writing my book on Hugh MacLennan’s Two Solitudes.
András was going to be on sabbatical from May 1990, and I’d had good news about a research grant that would release me from teaching for the next three years. We were going to leave this busy life behind, pack up our children and Hector, a few books and other belongings, and spend the year in Budapest.
That was the plan. And that was the start of the Budapest of my imagination.
It did work out, in most ways, but there were unpleasant surprises, along the way. The nastiest was learning that the man who rented our house was a crook. The loveliest was the fairytale hillside villa we moved into in Budapest in June, 1990. The fact that we ended up living there for two years rather than one was hardly any surprise at all.
The most miraculous surprise, for me, was that I was able to write a novel in Hungary.
We returned to Montreal in the summer of 1992, and Birds of Passage was published by Signature Editions in 1993. It’s been out of print for years and now, in a process of rediscovery, I’ve begun to serialize it here and here.
My own rediscovery of that early book, certainly, as I hadn’t reread it for decades.
A rediscovery of the Budapest of that pivotal time, when the first post-communist government elected in Hungary in June 1990 stumbled into something close to anarchy.
And a rediscovery of the hope that fledgling government represented — a hope already being dashed in our first months in Hungary, and a hope that looks poignantly, tragically over-optimistic when viewed in the dark light of today’s Hungary and today’s world.
I’ve never been an expert on Hungary.
I was a foreigner there with a limited understanding of the language. I had been there several times before, though, starting in 1972, and had always been one of only a few foreigners there. I was in the privileged position of having close contact with András, who is an expert, and with many other Hungarians through his extended family and close friends who had been dissidents under the old regime.
And I had daily contact, in my halting Hungarian and my almost-forgotten German, seldom in French and English, with neighbours, my sons’ friends, shopkeepers, my language teachers, and a widening circle of Hungarian writers and artists.
At that November lunch in Montreal, I dreamed I might have time to write while we were in Budapest. And I did start writing almost immediately after we settled in, keeping a journal, taking notes, working on what I thought might be an essay.
Only then, sometime in October 1990, history caught my imagination, and I found myself writing dialogue, structuring a story, and creating characters. I kept going all the next year, telling no one what I was doing, hardly daring to hope this would become a novel.
I was doing my research work, too, and I was editing manuscripts and working remotely with Matrix co-editor Kenneth Radu, designer Susan Valyi, and business manager Diane Hibbard on upcoming issues of the magazine — and, as the months went on, putting together a special issue of stories, poems and images by the writers, translators and artists I was meeting in Hungary. The title of that issue is “The Budapest of the Imagination.”
The rediscovery of Birds of Passage is the rediscovery, for me, of a city I loved and once knew quite well, for a foreigner.
It’s the rediscovery, too, of the person I was then — I was 40 years old in 1990 – and the warily hopeful and bedazzled eyes through which I saw that city at a time when it was impossible to guess what the future had in store for its world-weary denizens, its avian populations, myself, or my family.
Like this new Hungary, my literary career was just a fledgling in 1990. Blue Metropolis was nowhere on the horizon. I had no way of knowing I would one day be a publisher of other writers’ books. And the reason I never told anyone I was writing a novel is that I was afraid it would never get published.
I present it now for readers interested in a great city living through a period of turmoil; for anyone curious about the process of becoming a writer; for those few who will notice how literary mores have evolved in the intervening decades; for everyone mesmerized, as I am, by the power of the imagination; and for amateur ornithologists everywhere.

One of the beauties of this platform is that it allows me to publish chapters of a novel that’s long been out of print and, in the process reread it and reconsider it.
There are practical considerations. I have neither a Word version of the novel now, nor even a pdf, so I’ve been scanning the printed book, chapter by chapter. I then copy and paste each chapter into a Word document. This results in countless glitches I then edit —for “to” has repeatedly become “ot,” to take just that example, and entire paragraphs moved to another page. So, I’m looking for glitches as I reread, trying to catch them all, and making a (very) few other changes necessitated by the passage of time.
I haven’t read the novel as a whole since it was published in 1993, but I’ve now posted 7 of the novel’s 18 chapters online. And it’s a discovery — and not only because I’d forgotten so much of what I wrote in Hungary.
The woman I was 30 years ago is in many ways a stranger to me, for a start. And, as chapter follows chapter, I’m learning things I never knew about writing, about becoming a writer, about putting myself in other people’s shoes, pink or otherwise, and about the connections between writing and pivotal moments in a history, a story, a life.
I’ve been taking notes, this spring, for a new book, when I have half an hour to do so. I’m usually too busy, as I was in 1990, to sit down and just write.
In those days I was in the throes — of wrapping up a semester of teaching, research, editing a new issue of Matrix magazine, preparing another fiction manuscript for publication by Véhicule Press, walking Hector, preparing meals, taking my sons to music class, swimming, pottery.
And today, I’m on a family holiday in a world at war, playing with my grandson Remy, running a publishing business online, planning a boat ride on the Thames, pondering the meaning of family — and writing at 5 a.m. instead of sleeping.
Writing, in my experience, has always been what gets done when I should be doing something else. So, one surprise about Birds of Passage is that it ever got written.
I had forgotten much about Gábor, and almost everything about Eszter, Tivadar, Rudi, even Alice. I do remember focussing a lot of attention on Alice, in particular, for I didn’t want anyone to mistake her for me. In those days the inclusion of autobiographical traits was a favourite cavil in reviews of first novels written by women.
So I’d forgotten how unlike me Alice is, and how comical she can be. I’m both amused and bemused by her curious dress sense, her hair, her nose, her obsessive running, her jumpiness, her outspokenness — and her early career as a photographer with the Royal Ulster Constabulary, of all places.
1990 was a time of change. Every time is a time of change, personally and politically, it’s always both. Like right now, for example.
If I knew that Birds of Passage was a novel about change, though, I had forgotten the extent to which Northern Ireland — and Quebec — figure in the novel, which I remembered as being focused single-mindedly on Budapest.
That city has remained vivid in my memory, but the vividness is unspecific, so I’ve felt jolts of recognition when details in the novel remind me of so much I had forgotten — including the nesting Russian dolls with images of successive Soviet leaders that were on sale in those days on the streets of Budapest.
If I knew that Birds of Passage was a novel about change — everything I write being about change — I had forgotten the extent to which it’s also a novel about home. And about being homeless.
About nationalism, different nationalisms — the nationalisms of Hungary, of Ireland, of Canada and Quebec — that are not so very different from one another, at least to an outsider. And not that different from the nationalisms that are tearing the world apart right now.
The novel is about family, too, a subject that now interests me greatly, surrounded by three generations of my own family, travelling with them, attending a family wedding.It’s about love, about those who are close to you.About foreigners, too, and the foreigners who are close to you.About movement and migration, refugees, exiles, displaced persons, and expatriates, which include those closest to you.About what matters, and how what matters coalesces at key moments in a history, or a life.
I already knew, 30 years ago, that those moments were key, even if I had no way of knowing what would follow, what new vistas they might open up.
I now know what the next three decades had in store for me personally, and I know a lot more about how the future would unfold for Hungary and Ireland, too, not to mention Quebec.
And I now know my first novel did in fact get published; that’s what I hoped for, of course, when I lived in Budapest, hoping against hope. And that, too, has become part of my story. Which means my first novel does end up being in some way autobiographical, in spite of all.
I know much less Hungarian today than I did back then, and I know much less today about the marvellous, complicated city I loved and then left in 1992; that loss is part of the story, too.
And part of my own story. As is revisiting the novel on this platform today.
So, in some ways I don’t understand, Birds of Passage looks forward to a future it could not know, almost as though poised upon a peak in Darien.

Our stay in Budapest was awesome. We explored a lot of the city in the first several days, soaking in the history and enjoying the hot sunny weather, and then unfortunately the rain set in and we had a couple of lazy days to end our stay.
We opted to stay in an Air BnB for this destination which was a cozy little apartment in the centre of the city, close to tons of restaurants, stores, and attractions, as well as metro and tram stations. Air BnBs book up fast and so we had booked this a month or more prior, however, our dates did change and so we ended up switching to a different accommodation for our last three days which was just a few hundred meters down the road. As I’ve mentioned before, I love Air BnBs for stays longer than a few days purely because of kitchen access. It is so nice to have the flexibility of making dinner, snacks, a coffee in the morning, rather than always looking for a place to go which also adds up financially.
One of my favourite things to do in any European city is participating in a walking tour. I love doing them in our first couple of days as I find it helps orient you to the city, and you often get some helpful tips and recommendations from your tour guide. Every European city we’ve been to offers several free walking tours, and they’ve all be awesome. The guides are generally locals, often have postsecondary education in history or a related field, and are really passionate and knowledgeable about what they do. I find these by doing a simple Google search for “free walking tours in X city”, but I have found that “freetour.com” is a really good one which aggregates tours offered by different companies, shows reviews, allows you to filter for language, and has a very easy to use app.
In Budapest we did three tours, all through the tour company “Generation Tours”, and they were fabulous. The first was a general tour of the city where we learned some basic Hungarian, the importance of validating your public transit ticket before getting on to avoid very steep fines, and walked by/learned about many large sites such as Liberty Square, Parliament, St. Stephen’s Basilica. We also walked by “Shoes on the Danube Bank”, a Holocaust memorial from 2005, comprised of metal shoes lined up at the edge where many Jewish people were shot and bodies pushed into the river. The shoes are sculpted after real shoes from concentration camps. The shoes were left behind as they were valuable and a needed resource for soldiers during the war. I didn’t take pictures as it didn’t feel right to do so, but this is a really touching memorial and you can see photos with a quick google search.
Our second tour was of Buda Castle. It took us through the history of the city, the changing of hands, through the castle district including the famous Fisherman’s Bastion with views over the city, and ending at the castle itself. You can certainly explore this area on your own, it’s easy to get to, but I do think you get so much more out of your time there with a guide to help provide background and point out details.
The last tour we did here was of the Jewish Quarter which toured us to a few beautiful synagogues and through the Jewish area, discussed Hungary’s role throughout WWII, and shared stories of important individuals who helped save many Jewish people during those dark years. A lot of walking, a lot of information, but a great way to learn about the country’s culture and history.
We spent one of our days taking advantage of the warm sunny weather and exploring City Park. This is a huge area right on the metro line with large green spaces, playgrounds, and little cafes. It was lovely to wander through and sit and enjoy an iced coffee. We also explored Vajdahunyad Vara, an 1896 castle with gorgeous architecture.
At the far end of the park is Budapest Zoo and Botanical Garden which we spent a couple hours wandering through. I don’t always like supporting zoos, and they tend to be less exciting after seeing many of the animals in the wild on our South African Safaris and Asian monkey encounters… but nonetheless it was a really nice way to spend some time outdoors, the gardens/foliage in the area was beautiful. Outside of the zoo is also the famous Szechenyi Thermal Bath but we did not go in partly because we didn’t realize this is where it was so we didn’t have bathing suits with us, but also because we had planned to attend a different thermal bath instead.
We spent a rainy afternoon exploring the House of Terror, a museum in the building that once used as the headquarters during the fascist and communist regimes. It is an incredibly well-done museum with interesting displays and lots of background history, information shared in different formats such as historic footage and recent interviews with subtitles and audio translations, artifacts such as newspaper clippings and soldiers uniforms, and laminated information sheets at the entrance of each room. The basement is a cellar where prisoners were tortured, held, and killed. It is an eerie excursion, and one certainly worth doing.
There is certainly no shortage of restaurants in Budapest, although I will say that compared to some of our previous destinations, there is not as much variety. Hungarian food is flavourful and rich, often heavy on the meat and carbs, light on the vegetables, especially raw ones (similar to our next two stops as well). We of course tried all of the classics including goulash (a rich beef soup often served with bread on the side to soak up that delicious broth), chicken paprikash often served over dumplings that remind me of gnocchi in texture but have very little flavour themselves, and schnitzel. From our experiences, Hungarians do soup/stew very well — packed with flavor, they warm you from the inside out. Somehow we managed to go the week without sampling langos which is a circle of fried dough often topped with sour cream and cheese… sounds delish and I’m not sure how we missed that. Doner kebabs/shawarmas are also common and never fail to be a delicious, quick, cheap lunch. And there are bakeries that produce really tasty freshly baked bread, as well as a variety of pastries, my favourite being whole grain croissants filled with baked plums… a recommendation from my mom which quickly became my go-to when enjoying a cappuccino and sitting on a patio people watching. I’m not a huge beer person, but we of course sampled the local selections as well.
When you search most affordable places to travel, Hungary and Prague are always on the list. This is partly why we chose to visit these places and spend a week+ on them, especially given it is near the end of our travels and we anticipated budget being more important. Compared to many places in Europe, Budapest and Prague were certainly affordable, however, like many places in Europe and worldwide, they have been heavily impacted by Covid and inflation. When comparing menus from 1–2 years ago to their current menu on their Google page, we quickly saw a pattern of prices going up by 50%, sometimes doubling, sometimes even tripling. And so while these places were not outrageously expensive, they were more expensive than we had expected, especially with regard to food and alcohol. Public transit, as well as taxis/rideshare apps, remain quite inexpensive, and attraction tickets were pretty standard.
One of our tour guides told us that the thermal baths are a wonderful thing to do while visiting Budapest, however that there are many of them and some are very overpriced and overrun with tourists, taking away much of the charm and authenticity. He recommended Palatinus Strand Baths on Margaret Island as the best one to visit, as it is popular with locals, very reasonably priced, and beautiful. As I had wanted to see Margaret Island already we planned to follow his recommendation. Unfortunately, that entire plan got rained out. We also planned to do a cruise down the Danube river (either during the day or for sunset with some prosecco), but this was also rained out. Sure, you can do these things in the rain, and some of the baths are indoors, but ultimately we decided that if we were going to do them we wanted to really enjoy them, and being cold and wet would put too much of a damper (literally) on things, making us feel not as great about spending the money on them. We had planned to do these things in the second half of our week there, and we hoped the weather would clear… I guess it’s just a reason to go back! Not that we needed another reason because we really loved Budapest. The amount of history is incomparable to Canada, the buildings are stunning, the prices are reasonable, there are beautiful green spaces, and the atmosphere in the city is lively and draws you in. I’ll wrap up this post by sharing photos of just some of the street art that you see all over the city:

The beautiful city, glorious past and rich present
Budapest is the capital of Hungary and one of the most beautiful cities in Europe. It lies on the Danube River that divides it into two sections: Buda and Pest. Both sides are wonderful. The city has a very interesting history, very vibrant culture, an up-and-coming economy, and a favorite destination of travelers around the world.
Short History of Budapest
Ancient in a very sense, as long as the history can have been, Budapest comes since Romans first inhabited the place where they built towns around “Aquincum”, while after that land got populated by various different tribes such as Huns and Slavs and other related groups of people-Avars. In the ninth century, the Hungarian tribes set foot in the place as well, giving an emerging strong Hungarian kingdom rise at the same time, growing in power over periods from one century to the others.
From the 1500s till more than 150 years later, the city remained under the Ottoman Empire, thereby leaving Turkish baths and such influences. Following that, Austria ruled Hungary for so long that this city became part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Then, there was a burst of urbanization in this city with most of the famous buildings surrounding it.
However, in the 20th century, obstacles came to Budapest. During World War II, much destruction had occurred in Budapest and after that Soviet occupation continued until 1989. After 1989, Hungary became free, and modernisation began in Budapest.Culture of Budapest
Budapest is rich in culture and creativity. Old and new styles can be seen together. From Gothic to Baroque to Art Nouveau, the style of architecture varies. Some of the world’s most popular landmarks include the Hungarian Parliament building, Buda Castle, and Fisherman’s Bastion.
Hungarians love music, dance, and theater. They enjoy classical music and folk dance. There are several theaters, concert halls, and art galleries in Budapest. Traditional Hungarian folk music is unique and beautiful, and you can hear it at cultural events and festivals.
There are also the food aspects so profoundly tied up in Hungarian culture, for instance, the dishes which are goulash-a stew, rich and meaty and containing potatoes and paprika-and chimney cakes, sweetmeats shaped like spiral pastries.
Budapest is the central economic hub of Hungary. Since the collapse of communism in 1989, the city has been witnessing rapid growth and has, over the years, come to become a significant finance hub in Central Europe. Significant industries of Budapest include finance, tourism, technology, and manufacturing.
Now many international companies have their offices in Budapest, employing more people and attracting additional investment. In addition, the highly educated workforce and general business environment of the city are also among its strengths. Recently, the technology sectors have risen significantly, and many startups have made their base in Budapest.
Budapest Tourism
Millions of people visit the city every year to see historic sites, beautiful buildings, and unique attractions. The most popular destinations in Budapest are:Thermal BathsBudapest thermal baths attract millions of visitors due to the natural hot springs under the city.

What to do with a week in Budapest? Gaining attention for its Ruin Bars, beautiful architecture, and accessible transportation, Budapest is a great addition to your travel bucket list. Whether cramming in visits to multiple historic sites into one day or taking long breaks to relax at world famous bathhouses, the city has many opportunities for any traveler and a week is the perfect amount of time to explore it all.
The first thing to note when traveling to Budapest is that the city is a combination of three previously independent cities: Buda, Pest, and Obuda. Buda and Pest are divided by the famous Danube River, a peaceful landmark to walk alongside that also serves as a pathway to other cities via day trips by boat. Exploring both sides of the Danube is absolutely essential.
On the Buda side, sightsee at castle hill with its many museums and go back in time to Hungarian history. Take your time in the Hungarian National Gallery and Matthias Church taking in artwork and make sure to grab a pastry at Ruszwurm Confectionery, one of Budapest’s oldest bakeries. Walk around below the castle to see a more calm side of Budapest and don’t be afraid to explore!
On the Pest side, make sure to walk around the Parliament building which grandly overlooks the Danube. The opera house is also a great place to take a tour and listen to a musical sample, but be sure to book the tour in English in advance, especially in high tourist season (or, settle for the tour in Spanish, French, Italian, or German). Wander the galleries at the Museum of Fine Art and Kunsthalle, and take a look at Hero’s Square for even more history and art. If you’re looking for nightlife, Budapest’s Ruin Bars certainly won’t disappoint with their bustling maze-like interiors and colorful light displays.
The city is incredibly well connected; tourists can easily take buses, trains, and trolleys to get to just about any destination. Don’t miss out on taking the oldest electric metro system to a bathhouse and relaxing at one of Budapest’s many natural hot springs. There are options for everyone on both sides of the city to enjoy the warm water as ‘Budapesti’ (Budapest natives) have been doing for centuries.
Budapest, with its tumultuous history, is notably a city to learn a lot from when you visit. Signs of the Austro-Hungarian empire are everywhere-–from the massive parliament building to over the top gilded cafes. The Soviet occupation of Hungary is also still present, and its four decades of history loom over the city, which was largely devastated after WWII.
If you’re lucky to get the chance to visit Budapest, take your time to explore the city completely rather than quickly jumping around tourist attractions. You won’t regret learning from locals and getting a full experience of the city.
Safe travels!

arrive in istanbul airport early morning get your bearings need to snag wifi to download mapsme for turkey forgot to tackle that one in sri lanka before takeoff the wifi here takes some hoops jump them get cash exchange figure out transport to hostel neighborhood get through passport control.
part of this on the move/keeping the senses sharp has to do with handling what is often initial aversion. i arrived in istanbul the way i have in a handful of other cities: tired, a tad confused, feeling an outsider, accompanied by a little guy on my shoulder asking me why i’m doing this.
you could be home eating a cheeseburger. you could wake up in your own bed. you could be on a beach in thailand. you could be in the laotian mountains where your ten dollar bills lasted all day. etc.
you get over that hill and at sunset you find you aren’t thinking those thoughts — you haven’t been during this whole walk come to think of it. where did they go? the next morning the neighborhood is a little more yours, on account of the walk you took last night. a few more of the signs make sense. by lunch time your heart is where your feet are, and now you are traveling again. world/oyster.

fuckin earthquakes. istanbul the second area, bangkok the first, i’m visiting after a pretty dramatic earthquake event. whistling past the graveyard. nobody died but it was big and a decent amount of people got hurt jumping out of buildings. these people are traumatized by earthquakes. in 1999 a quake killed 18,000 in northwest turkey. a real doozy in the southeast in 2023 claimed over 50,000 lives. i saw people during my visit sleeping in tents in parks, the most recent shakeup reminding them all too clearly that the plates of the earth under istanbul are locked. it’s a “powder keg”, as one professor put it. some day the building stress will burst.
—
i hopped off a bus one day before my destination because i thought i might die if i didn’t get some bread i was hungry particularly for bread with some of the chunk of butter i had in my backpack for just such an occasion and without having a clue that i was close to something cool i turned a corner and stumbled across a massive, beautiful wall that’s part of the aqueduct of valens, a 4th century roman structure. and that is kind of wild, being from somewhere where nothing is old, to stumble upon such a thing in the middle of a city.
—
there’s a passage in orhan pamuk’s red haired woman, that i can’t find because i no longer have the book, about seeing old men in istanbul passing their days on cafe patios. this is a signature feature of this part of the world to me, as little time as i have spent in it. i found the men in athens charming for it. on a morning walk many people are clearly in motion to get somewhere: tourists to a site, young people to work. fellas in their 60’s or more are just sitting on stools in their black jackets smoking smegs and having espresso. shooting the shit with their dudes. it’s 50 and sunny and breezy. why not. i join them and it’s nice.
—
i had been told the neighborhood of kadikoy was an essential visit in istanbul. i asked the man working the hostel if there’s anything i should do there.
“you should not have a plan this go to kadikoy. just sometimes is better no plan. walk around.”
music to my ears my friend. a great afternoon spent.
—
a hostel owner said when he opened his spot in sultanahmet in the early 90’s there were only a few of them around. not many tourists came then, but he did have some cool stories about caravans of hippies that used to meet there before driving to nepal every year. now sultanahmet is densely packed with tourist accommodations. he gave me a couple cups of cay as we chatted before i checked out. on a day committed to sightseeing touristy type stuff i drank maybe eight cups of cay. they are served in very small portions. you are meant to consume many tasty little cups.
“‘you drink cay all day.’‘yes of course life is short.’”
—
polis brigades — i just happened to be staying in the neighborhood of ferikoy when and where, according to the bbc, “50,000 police officers deployed to the city as authorities attempt(ed) to crack down on May Day protests…Public transport was shut down to stop people reaching Taksim Square, where demonstrations have been banned since 2013.”
in some sense people protest on may day every year in the name of labor rights, but this year the government is a little more on edge. mainly because president erdogan’s government arrested the mayor of istanbul on trumped up corruption charges. apparently corrupt assholes who have manipulated power for a quarter century don’t like it when popular mayors voice dissent and it happens to be dissent that the masses agree with. some 400 protestors were arrested.
all i wanted to do was get a bus to a ferry location so i could go to the princes islands. blockages on the streets made this difficult. my bag was checked to walk across one road. impossible to get a taxi. i just walked to the ferry but since that was downhill and not exactly short i was really hoping after the day trip the shenanigans would be in enough of the past that i could taxi back up it, but that was also not possible.
i feel quite often, in life and not just traveling, like the very confused old man i saw at the cordoned off kabatas bus stop. he had a bag of groceries. i watched him on and off for a couple minutes while he glanced around and then ahead again at the shut off access. he appeared stupefied. i imagine him leaving home with a story playing in his head about how he would get home from the river and the way he would get home from the river was a bus station that operated with incredible reliability. all the sudden standing, wondering why the world is not doing what he had thought it would. perplexed.
a good hike and pleasant company on the island. raki with a view.
—
at aga hamami men have been getting scrubbed down by men here in non-gay fashion simce 1454. turkish bath style. azim with tender loving care gave life to my muscles sore from miles and miles of concrete walking.
after the bubble rub he told me to sit up and was pouring bowls of water over me. baptism-esque. he said “ready” and without even thinking of what the question might mean i said yes — in for a penny in for a pound — and he dumped a bowl of cold water down the front of my shorts, smiled at me, and said “good morning”.
it’s substantially more comfortable to do meandering travel days when it’s not 95 degrees. my entire belongings weigh quite little and i don’t mind carrying them around a city at 55 degrees. i can bounce around istanbul cafes and parks and bars for the whole day with my bag on my back before making the night bus. show up in the morning in sofia, bulgaria find a coffee shop read a bit sightsee a little and check into the hostel in the afternoon. in southeast asia i would have been, well, smellier, with that strategy.
at 8:11 on a saturday in sofia no coffee shops are open. i stopped into one that two people were seated outside of, having coffee. the door was open. the emplyees looked at me and said “we are not open yet.” a place literally called coffee lab wasn’t open either. how do these people do it. i do not know. sometime around 9 i stumbled upon a fix for my addiction.
—
if i drive 7 hours from my home people will be dressed and talk very like where i left. this idea is foreign in europe. languages, or at minimum accents, change quickly. it’s almost as if our culture was too young before modernity made interconnectedness the norm for things to silo off much.
in a crowded istanbul beer hall full of my peers i noted only one person that was not covered head to toe in neutral colors. in sofia they wear colors, some of them haphazardly combined. some clothes remind you of that store the buckle. this is not a compliment. it’s painting with a broad brush but let’s just say the bulgarians of sofia are not as pretty as the turks of istanbul. then again, bulgaria is not a pretty sounding word, and there’s that adage about how people will become their names.
—
i arrived sick which is not so much fun. sick is when it’s really nice to be at home. on your couch. it’s not a joy to be in the public. you feel like you’re gross to them and you don’t want to see them either. i saw a doctor for fifty bucks and he helped me out a bit.
—
“I don’t mean a casual desire for travel, not a tourist’s curiosity for sites and landmarks and languages and new faces, but a precise and uncomplicated conviction that the world was available to me.” — i think this is also from that pamuk book but now i can’t figure it out. and i feel that way often now. out here.
—
i happened to be sitting in a sofia coffee shop when i read in the return by hisham matar a passage about an italian architect who consulted on works on the st. alexander nevsky cathedral in sofia. serendipitous. i walked over because that’s a nice little low energy activity for someone under the weather and i like sitting in houses of worship.
i have been doing this in buildings belonging to a number of faiths on a couple different continents lately. the instinct of most secular americans is to start off with one’s problems of the metaphysical claims of various religions— but if you can just get over yourself enough and just sit there they are often a quite nice place to be.
—
when people at home ask me what people are “like” somewhere i often say something like people are nice everywhere and a smile is universal. a smile is not, in fact, universal. i felt very much like i was in eastern europe once i got to sofia. a number of smiles met stone walls. people aren’t mean. they just aren’t all opening up to you and that’s fine. i lived with an estonian couple once who was not unkind but who took a long time to warm up to me and actually have a conversation, considering there was only me and one other person they interacted with daily. us living in a secluded farmhouse.
—
both the cashier at the mini mart who struck up a conversation with me that began with the powers of the bacteria in bulgarian yogurt and had a dabble in the minnesota timberwolves and the bulgarian-post-punk-looking hostel worker said a day trip to plovdiv, the oldest continuously inhabited city in europe, was a “must”. these are the types of people you listen to, and they were right.
another border another random selection of me for bag searching. the jacked border patrol guy presents as “i listen to serbian jordan peterson”. not a compliment. he looked personally insulted when he asked what i was doing in serbia and i said just traveling. i had to strongly fight the urge to tell him to look at all the fucking stamps from the last couple months in the passport he kept waving up and down and staring at my picture in.
—
david’s wife died seven years ago, his kids are now both at university, and he recently retired, so now he does things like bicycle the entire length of the danube and share an evening of large red wine decanters and mugs of beer with generally disheveled thirty something backpackers from sauk centre, minnesota.
—
the belgrade fortress makes clear why the city has been fought over some 115 times in its history. destroyed and rebuilt 40–45 times. it’s prime location, resting on top of a hill right where the sava and danube rivers connect.
i am left to wonder what that does to a people. how one could possibly argue it wouldn’t lead to some ingrained difference in constitution for its population. how many of these people have family stories? how many have personal stories? i remember shooting pool in thailand with a shellshocked kid — i call him kid because of who i am now but he was a man, early 20’s — who just got done with his military service in israel and when i asked what his position was he said combat soldier and he had ghosts in his eyes. hard to imagine what he’s seen or how it could be left behind.
—
on hostel courtesy. if you’re leaving at 5am then yes you should prepack the night before so to not be fumbling around while people are mid-snooze.
smiles not universal. i was told the 74 and the 72 go to the national park outside of town but the city bus driver on the 74 says no when i ask if he is going to the national park and he closes the door behind me anyways. then i ask him if the 72 goes there and he just shrugs a “who could know” shrug. cool.
spent the first part of the day walking to a city park and the danube beach instead. stopped at a museum in the afternoon and spent a good five or six hours bouncing around old town reading in bars and on cafe patios alone. found a fernet. having an actual bar instead of only tables is a feature of american culture that makes being alone much easier. and easier to meet people. it’s casual to strike up a conversation with the bartender or a fellow bar sitter. it takes a lot more intrusion to approach a table — hey can we be frens!?!?
—
in eastern europe the local population is wholesome park participants. people spend time in parks. it’s nice. i have lived in msp for eight years and not once has someone asked me to meet them in a park to hang out. have a picnic.
very, very committed to statues as a culture. some of the angels appear to be tormented by their task. role, maybe. at eternity it maybe ceases being a task.
—
“perhaps these people are especially devout. look at them in church filling it up on any old day.” i thought that to myself. i then realized it is sunday and not yet noon. time and days have lost themselves two months in to backpacking. eat when i’m hungry. sleep when i fall into it. i drink coffee at absolutely any hour. bus when i’m ready to go.
—
in minneapolis we have the warehouse district which is meant to describe a neighborhood with repurposed old buildings for modern, hip use. the official warehouse district website uses descriptives like “rich culture”, “eclectic”, and “dynamic urban atmosphere”. but the interior of most of those establishments carries the aesthetic taste of white bread with miracle whip. the warehouse district is where culture goes to die. sanitized into submission.
in budapest there is a trend for the last quarter century of ruin bars. they embrace the decay of the buildings, house mismatched furniture, and the decor is like a dive bar regular went to a thrift store on a pound of coke and then collaged the walls. the ruin bars are fantastic. i have described tom’s burnt down cafe on madeline island as mad max meets jimmy buffet concert, and if tom’s was just dropped in the middle of a city it would qualify as a ruin bar. that is the closest thing i can think of to this.
—
i take it as a personal offense that they serve weak ass coffee in budapest in hipster coffee shops. like americano as hot bean water even when you pay for an extra shot.
something about budapest was eating at me after a couple days. not just the weak coffees. maybe just a me thing. who knows. the buildings and museums are undeniably striking. it is a remarkable city. i stayed in one of the cutest hostels i’ve ever seen. sunsets at the river are quite an experience. but something. maybe the crowds, who seem less like travelers than people who are obviously on vacation. an important distinction. maybe feeling like a mark. always paying for the view and not the product. i am glad i went. i was ready to leave. next, croatia.
you can watch the sun set in all sorts of ways. can gaze at the horizon it’s dropping off. can look to the horizon opposite and see the shade darken incrementally. you can stare at the leaves on a tree when they go from lime to mint to night. can watch a line move up the wall of a building until it’s gone and then when it’s gone it really is gone. it is. wrecks me every time. i saw a young girl maybe 12 taking a picture of a flower with a camera not a phone but a camera and that made me feel better.

When I was studying Geography, Budapest and Bucharest were both capitals of countries and Belgrade was the capital of Yugoslavia. I’d often have to think carefully to decide that Budapest was the capital of Hungary and Bucharest was the capital of Romania. After spending time in both, I wondered how such similar-sounding cities could be so different.
I love Budapest. I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t. For me, the fact that it has thermal baths is enough of a drawcard. It doesn’t need anything else. But the beautiful bridges, the beautiful river, the beautiful buildings, the beautiful railway stations, the beautiful dogs: everything is beautiful.
Just look at the difference in accommodation!

Before visiting Budapest, I had no idea that this was one of the 25 most visited cities in Europe or that this city was the most central point in Europe. I knew very little or nothing about the Hungarian people or Budapest. All the places I visited and my experiences formed my vision of the Hungarian people and Budapest city.
This article is dedicated to all the places that I consider a must-see on a visit to Budapest, but it is also an article dedicated to the history of the Hungarian people and Budapest.
Today we know the capital Budapest by this name, but the truth is that Buda and Pest are two different areas, which like their name, they were not always unified. The Chain Bridge connected the two halves of the city in 1849. However, it was not until 1873 that Budapest's name became one; Pest is the generally flat eastern portion of the city of Budapest, covering about two-thirds of Budapest is separated from Buda by the Danube River. Buda, in turn, is located in the western part and is composed mainly of hills and forests.

Before I traveled to Budapest I never thought that I would enjoy their food that much. My first impression of the city was very favorable, but after spending there two more days I felt like I was falling in love with the city.
And one of the reasons why is its food.
If you read just about any travel guide about visiting Hungary, you will find that when visiting Budapest one absolutely must try Gulash soup. Pretty much the same way the guides insist on you visiting October Fest when in Germany.
Unless you absolutely can not imagine your life without a stew of meat and vegetables, you can skip Gulash in Budapest the same way you can skip drinking overpriced beer in München while watching drunken American tourists puking all over the place during the October Fest.
You would enjoy your German beer so much better sipping it in one of the German Biergarten on a sunny day.
Madal Cafe
Madal is a specialty cafe in Budapest that received its name after the peace philosopher Sri Chinmoy, whose childhood nickname was “Madal”. They have roasted coffee every week in their specialty micro roastery near Budapest since 2014.
Sri Chinmoy is a spiritual teacher who was both a philosopher and an excellent sprinter, winning the ashram championship for 16 consecutive years. In the cafe itself, they put a stature of Sri, which I found unique and interesting.

Today I’ll be your guide on a journey through culture and cuisine!
Buda-Best stole my heart and became a safe place for healing scars. Whenever I face a difficult period in my life, my curing place wipes my tears, when I escape I run to you. Your elegant streets bring harmony to my soul, give me solutions when I question what my future steps should be, and help me overcome what is better left in the past. You can almost feel the history and breathe the love of its stories. Anyone can be skeptical about the country but never of its capital.
“You can’t buy happiness, but you can buy a plane ticket to Budapest. And that’s pretty much the same thing.”
I spent a lot of my childhood and teenage years in Budapest. I always told my little brother, with whom I visited a million times, that when he grows up I want him to take a backpack and go out into the wide world to find his happiness… but that he shouldn’t forget his home.
My home town is located only 100 km from Budapest. I was living between two cultures, Slovak and Hungarian. I believe everyone has a certain bond to a country of their origin, but I have to admit that Bratislava is not as magnificent as Budapest. It’s just…

The Marauding Mummy

Listen

My inner germaphobe recoiled in horror as I dipped my toes into the steamy, chlorine-free waters of Szechenyi Baths. Nobody else seemed to mind that this place was the perfect breeding ground for a multitude of horrifying drug-resistant bacteria. White and caramel-colored bodies sat placidly in the armpit grease-filled pools, enveloped by rising steam, but a few were busy sucking in their tummies and sticking out their chests for the ‘gram.
“Weeeeeeeeee!” my 5-year-old screamed as he dive-bombed into a pool outdoors, splashing murky water onto several flawlessly made-up faces. The aspiring models waded away, scowling.
The city’s claim to fame — its thermal springs — have long attracted scores of admirers. First came the Romans, who established their regional capital here over 2,000 years ago after Marcus Aurelius discovered that his soldier’s wounds healed faster when they bathed in these hot springs, and then the Turks who, during their occupation in the 16th and 17th century, constructed a handful of public baths which are still being used today.
Among the dozens of baths around Budapest, Szenchenyi is one of the largest and most popular spa complexes in Europe, hosting everyone from Madonna to Richard Nixon. In this handsome building more than a hundred years old, you can find indoor pools with temperatures that range form hot to only-Satan-bathes-here…
…and three open-air pools — only the latter is open to kids under 14.
So there I was, on a chilly May morning, shivering in my bikini. I couldn’t decide which was more appealing — hypothermia or staph infection — but my kids chose for me, having jumped into the pool immediately after disrobing.
As soon as I found myself relaxing in the water, my kids pulled me to the centre of the pool (correction: whirlpool) where we spun around like a a pair of socks in a tumble dryer and I almost fractured my hip bone trying to escape.
After toweling off, we went to Heroes’ Square to cower before the fierce countenance of the Magyars, the ancestors of present day Hungarians . The Magyars — skilled horsemen who are said to have originated from Central Asia — were the most fearsome warriors after the Vikings. I felt a little thrill knowing that my Asian brothers managed to ride all the way here over a thousand years ago, pillaging and conquering towns along the way…
…but the statues bear more resemblance to Harrison Ford than any Asian I’ve known.
Anyway, I totally get why the Magyars wanted to settle here.
Hungary is flat like the Steppes, and a river winds placidly through the capital, carrying with it wealth and news from other parts of Europe. The Danube, however, was not blue as Johann Strauss has promised, but rather the colour of a day-old baby’s poop (which explains why nobody swims there). That did not stop us from sailing with Lagenda Sightseeing Cruise, marveling at some of the city’s flamboyant landmarks, many of which were built in 1896 to commemorate the 1000th anniversary of the Magyars’ arrival and to thumb their nose at their rivals, Vienna.
One of the most grandiose of these is the Fisherman’s Bastion, which is a misnomer since it has no fishermen, but rather, hundreds of tourists all jostling for the perfect picture. This Disney-like monument reclines atop a hill and is purely ornamental, rather than functional.
Its centerpiece, Matthias Church, is way older, dating back to the Middle Ages. It is the site of many royal marriages and coronations…and this is starting to sound like a very dry history lesson so we’ll stop here.
The kings lived nearby, in ated a female servant, salvation is only a short walk away).While I’d love to pay a visit to the king and swig Buda Castle, presumably for convenience (I mean, if he has killed a blood relative for the throne or impregn palinka with him, monarchy ended in 1918 and the royal residence has now been converted into a library and several museums.
The Hungarian Parliament, which was also built as part of the millennial celebrations, makes the Houses of Parliament in London look modest. We booked a guided tour, and were herded like cows around the opulent interior, bristling with hand-carved statues, ceiling frescoes and convenient workplace facilities like a post office, a clinic and — perhaps the most important of all — a hair salon (because God forbid one has a bad hair day during a parliament sitting).
But perhaps the most intimidating room of all was the dome hall, where two guards holding drawn sabres stood watch over the crown jewels. Because it must be incredibly tiresome to stand still and have tourists buzz around you like flies day in and day out, they were ready to flay anyone who gets too close — a poor lady got the fright of her life when a guards sprang into action, snarling and waving his weapon (which he no doubt sharpens every day) in her face.
Like, we get it dude, your life sucks. Stop taking it out on others.
We had our first taste of Hungarian food and liquor at the Great Market Hall, where mountains of fiery red and yellow paprika — used liberally in Hungarian cuisine, from soups to cakes — graced shopfronts, while salami and sausages made from mangalica, a traditional Hungarian delicacy made from a local woolly pig, dangle from the ceilings. There were also shops selling jars upon jars of pickled everything — including melons — and a bakery selling freshly made, piping hot strudels. I bought one stuffed with cottage cheese and it was beautiful.
After a satisfying round of made-in-China souvenir shopping upstairs, we sat down for lunch in Fakanal Etterem, one of the more expensive restaurants in the market hall. The place is as touristy as it gets, with Hungarian tasting platters and roving folk musicians, but the food — which came accompanied with some salty, spicy paprika paste — was enjoyable.
Heck, I was starting to develop a certain fondness for Hungarian grub when I boldly gulped down some Unicum.
Everything about the Unicum is offensive, from its name to its taste. But just as I was about to buy a one-way ticket out of Hungary to get as far away as possible from this liquor, I had some toltott kapozsta, or traditional meat-stuffed cabbages drenched in tomato sauce, and the world was right again.
We also dropped by the Belvarosi Piac, a smaller, more authentic farmer’s market. Locals come here to shop for local produce and eat in one of the handful of casual food stalls owned by renowned Budapest chefs upstairs.
Despite its unpronounceable name, MoszkvatéЯ is a solid Russian eatery specializing in street food versions of traditional Russian cuisine. You’d think the Russians were only good for two things — mobsters and matryoshka dolls — but, no, their pelmenyi topped with caviar and sour cream is every bit as deserving of our attention too.
It is said that you can’t leave Budapest without trying langos, a favorite snack among the locals. We came upon this deep-fried dough at a summer fair, and — after apologizing to our arteries — decided to have ours doused in sour cream and grated cheese. It tasted remarkably similar to ham chim peng, the Asian doughnut that was such a regular fixture in my not-so-great childhood.
We took a cue from the food tours that regularly drop by Callas Cafe and had tea and desserts there. Situated on Andressy Ut, Budapest’s very own Champs Elysees, this gorgeous restaurant serves Hungarian pastries in art deco surroundings. I helped myself to the opera cake, an elegant chocolate confection layered with mousse and wafer, and it was as beautiful as Maria Callas, the world famous soprano who inspired it.
It took me awhile to realize that my mother’s apartment — yes, she lives there — was located in the Jewish Quarter, where 70,000 Jews were forced to live during the Nazi occupation in 1944.
Whole communities were wiped out, but the place is experiencing a revival of Jewish culture, judging from the number of new kosher restaurants in the vicinity. We loved walking around this disheveled, graffiti-sprayed neighborhood, exploring its hidden courtyards and ruin pubs — without the children, of course. Hungary may be part of Europe, but it feels different, grittier and more exotic.
We also stopped by the Dohany Utca Synagogue, Europe’s largest synagogue. Its elegant Moorish facade, however, hides a grim history. Beside it, the Garden of Remembrance stood, a mass grave for murdered Jews. Some of the victims’ names were inscribed into the weeping willow memorial nearby.
And then there is the Raoul Wallenberg Memorial, named for the Swedish consul who saved tens upon thousands of Jews during World War II by smuggling them out of trucks bound for the detention camps and into safe houses. He was eventually arrested by the Soviets for espionage and died in a gulag. But what disturbs me is that real-life heroes like him aren’t as well-known or celebrated as Iron Man or Wolverine. Their faces have disappeared, swept away by the tide of history.
It’s like they never existed.
After the excitement of the baths, we preferred to indulge in some low-key fun and relaxation with the children. So we took a tram to Margaret Island, a peaceful, car-free recreational reserve wedged in middle of the Danube. Locals come here to bike, swim and generally get away from the bustling city.
I mean, what could possibly go wrong, right? Right?!
Well, the problem began when we rented an electric buggy to check out some ruins of a church. Instead of following us, our 3-year-old clambered onto the driver’s seat in front and stepped on the pedal — accidentally it seemed, because he began screaming for help when the car propelled forward for quite a distance….before crashing into a tree.
The boy, while inconsolable, survived with minor scrapes and bruises.
But yes, Budapest is beautiful. Just don’t expect relaxation to be part of the vocabulary when you’re holidaying with kids.
STAY
New York Palace, Autograph Collection This resplendent baroque-style hotel sits within walking distance of Budapest’s top sights. Amenities include a gym, spa and pool. The in-house New York cafe has long been an institution, thanks to visiting poets and writers. Rooms are tastefully furnished, with large bathrooms, but do not that it can be quite noisy as the hotel sits at a busy intersection. Be sure to ask for a quieter room on a higher floor if you’re a light sleeper. $$$

Hi guys, I’ve decided to continue writing my travel stories on my personal blog website “Wandering Sten” for easier access for everyone. There is no need to create an account and sign in as well as monthly reading limits. Click here to read Discovering Budapest and Beyond in a Month.
It’s my first time traveling to Europe and my first destination is Budapest, the capital city of Hungary. I spent about a month here and there’s so much to say about this Hungarian capital and the country that I don’t think I can fit everything in a single post. But I’ll share a brief and informative overview of my memorable experience living in Budapest and visiting other places in Hungary.
It may be Europe, and it may be part of the European Union but it’s still an affordable city to live in. With some tricks and a diligent search on accommodation across various platforms (best if you have a local to help you find accommodation), you can find a nice place to live without breaking the bank. At the time of visiting, I was working remotely and that means my job doesn’t require me to be in a specific geographic location. I can do it anywhere from my laptop as long as I have a reliable internet connection and luckily Hungary is a developed country with excellent infrastructure including high-speed internet access everywhere.
I love Budapest and all of Hungary in general. I know people have different opinions and have said different things about the city or the nation, but personally, my time there was amazing. The people are friendly to me, the food is amazing, and it’s just a beautiful country all around. To be fair, I had a wonderful guide to show me around and help me with so many things. So whenever possible, I suggest you try to mingle with the locals or go on guided tours by the locals to get the full experience.
I visited Budapest and some other cities back in August 2017 and I’ve come back again for another two months towards the end of that year. I’ve personally visited and experienced everything that I’ve written here and all other facts and tips are thoroughly updated and checked. I plan to visit Hungary again soon and will update this guide accordingly.
Budapest is divided into districts and they are 23 of them. Some of the most popular districts to live in are district 5 which is called Belváros (which means downtown in Hungarian), districts 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, and 1 (Castle district on the Buda side). You can find most of the main tourist attractions in District 5 such as the dazzling Országház or the Hungarian Parliament Building, St Stephen’s Basilica, Shoes on the Danube monument, and the Chain Bridge. However, each district has its characteristics and charms so if you have more time check out other districts as well.
As for pricing, the accommodation in the innercity ranging from 150,000–200,000 Hungarian Forint/month (435–580 Euros) for a 1-bedroom apartment. If you don’t mind living on the outskirts of the city center, let say 20–30 minutes by public transport, you can still find cheaper accommodation ranging from 90,000–120,000 HUF month (260–350 EUR) for a 1-bedroom apartment. For my first visit to Budapest, I stayed in Frangepán ut. which is in District 13 and it’s less than 20 minutes to downtown and I also stayed in Újpest, District 4 and is a quiet and safe residential area located just 30 minutes to downtown Budapest by the public transport.
Another nice thing about Budapest is they have a really good and affordable public transport system. The network is made up of busses, trams, four underground metro lines, water busses, and suburban railways. A one-way ticket costs about 350 HUF(1 EUR) and the monthly pass costs about 9500 HUF (28 EUR).
There’s a funicular with great views that you can take for a ride up to the castle district from Clark Adam Ter. It’s not included in the regular public transport ticket but you can purchase the tickets at the entrances on the way up and down for 1200 HUF (3.5 EUR). During Christmastime, there’s an illuminated tram overlooking the Danube river and the Buda Castle that runs along the Pest riverfront, all the way from Jászai Mari tér by Margaret Bridge to Közvágóhíd. The tram is decorated in beautiful Christmas lights and it’s such a unique experience to ride in the tram. You don’t need to pay extra to ride on the Christmas tram as you can use your standard ticket fares and passes.
The first thing that I noticed when I walk around Budapest is the architecture. The whole city is filled with beautiful buildings from different historical eras in Europe such as Baroque, Art Nouveau, Bauhaus, and Socialist. All the sightseeing attractions also not far from each other and can be reached within walking distance. Here’s the list of places that I think you can’t miss while you’re visiting Budapest:
This is probably the most iconic landmark in Budapest if not the whole of Hungary. Home to hundreds of parliamentary offices, the building is a sight to behold in every angle but the best full view is from the other side of the Danube river. Certain parts of the Parliament Building is open for guided tours daily and you get to see the great vaulted hall, the richly decorated central staircase, the Hungarian Crown Jewels, and the Hungarian Holy Crown.
Heroes’ Square is another iconic monument in Budapest. You will see big statues of the Seven Chieftains of Magyar and other important Hungarian national leaders as well as the 36 m high Corinthian column in the middle of the square with Archangel Gabriel on its top holding St. Stephen’s Crown.
Just behind the Heroes’ Square, there’s the Budapest City Park, a lovely park with lots of leafy walkways for strolls with friends and family. In the area, you’ll find the gorgeous Harry-Potter-like Vajdahunyad Castle — Museum of Hungarian Agriculture and not far from it, Budapest’s most famous and picturesque thermal bath Széchenyi Bath and Budapest Zoo & Botanical Gardens.
Also known as the Great Market Hall, this is a lively and large indoor market that is popular among tourists and locals. The three-story hall is massive in size and looks grandeur from the outside. Come here to browse among the stalls and counters selling seasonal produces, freshly-baked pogácsa (the Hungarian scone), various salamis, lángos, truffle paté, pickles, gourmet jams (plum, lavender), and souvenirs.
It is a small island covered in parkland and recreational facilities situated in the middle of the Danube river. Although quite small in size, it has some medieval ruins, a small zoo, gardens, musical fountains, a water park, playgrounds, running track, swimming pools and even dance clubs! This lovely green island is a great spot for hanging out with friends and located just a few throws away from downtown Budapest. Come here for jogging, picnic with friends and family, or simply taking a romantic stroll with your special one! ;)
This is an elegant avenue connecting the downtown with Heroes’ Square and City Park. It’s almost identical to the upscale Parisian boulevards in Paris and for that reason, you can find many luxury shops and high-end restaurants on this street. Other popular attractions such as the beautiful Hungarian State Opera and House of Terror Museum also located on Andrássy Avenue.
Overlooking the Danube river and across the Pest side of the city, Buda Castle is probably Budapest’s crown jewel. This world heritage site is located in the Castle District/Hill, here you can also find the Royal Palace, Fishermen’s Bastion, and Matthias Church — all are beautiful sightseeing spots that you can’t miss while in Budapest. The entire district is well-preserved (some of it dated back to the Medieval era) and as you strolled the cobblestone walkways, you can find lovely old houses, museums, cozy cafes and restaurants, even do wine tasting in historic Faust Wine Cellar. For the best panoramic view of the city, head to the Fishermen’s Bastion and don’t forget to check out the Castle Bazaar and Royal Gardens for seasonal events and more dining options.
Another great spot for panoramic views of Budapest is Gellért Hill. It’s a 140-meters high dolomite rock hill located by the Danube river on the Buda side of the city. Especially popular for weekend outings, the hill is filled with trees and you can hike on its winding trails that lead up to a Citadella where the Liberty Statue stands.
One of my most favorite things to do in Budapest is trying all different kinds of food and drinks. Forget the stereotypical bland western cuisines here, Hungary has many delicious authentic dishes and Budapest, in general, has a diverse and vibrant dining scene. Though not so popular in comparison to France and Italy, Hungary also produce great quality wines and I loved them! Here’s a list of some food that I’ve tried and loved while in Budapest:
Fun fact: Lángos is the first thing that I ate when I arrived in Budapest and what a good starter it is! Considered as Hungary’s best street food, it’s a fluffy fried dough covered in cheese and other toppings such as sour cream, bacon, onion, and parsley. It’s so delicious and satisfying and you can find Lángos easily in food kiosks, cafes, or restaurants everywhere in Hungary. My favorite place to buy Lángos is from a food kiosk just by the entrance of Lehel Csarnok (Lehel Market) which is a well-known local indoor market. Prices vary depending on where you buy it and whether you have additional topping or not but generally it costs around 350–700 HUF (1–2 EUR).
This is one of the most celebrated and iconic dishes in Hungarian culinary. There are many versions of Goulash whether it’s regional or international, but essentially, it’s a rich stew made from beef (or veal and pork), potato, carrot, spices, and the world-famous Hungarian paprika. It’s a highly fulfilling and flavorful dish that you have to try when visiting Hungary.
This is another of my favorite Hungarian dish and it’s unique. It is a thick vegetable stew made from variations of lentils, potato, peas, beans, or carrot simmered and thickened by flour mixed with sour cream. I imagined this is a typical home-cooked meal for Hungarians and they’re also really easy to make. My favorite is the green-colored peas Főzelék and goes well with bread, you can find this healthy but fulfilling dish in most restaurants in Hungary.
Okay, in my opinion, all the cakes that I’ve tasted in Hungary are delightful but if I must pick one I’d choose Dobos Torte. It’s a moist sponge cake layered with chocolate buttercream and topped with caramel; it’s heavenly! Hungary has a sweet tradition of holding the annual national cake contest where each year during St. Stephen’s Day on August 20th, they pick the best cake and crown it as the “Cake of Hungary.” The recipe for the winning cake then shared with the general public and you can find the cake in almost every dessert shop, cafes, and restaurants in Hungary.
If you can’t remember how to pronounce the name of this pastry that’s okay because you’ll remember how it tastes (and made). Kürtöskalács or the Chimney Cake is a Hungarian treasure in a form of a sweet spiral strip that is spun and then wrapped around a truncated cone baked over charcoal and coated in plenty of sugar while basted with melted butter until its surface cooks to a delectable golden-brown color. How does that sound? Yummy! If you’re extra like me, you can also add additional toppings such as cinnamon, cocoa, shredded coconut (my favorite because I’m tropical), or chopped walnuts and they elevate this famous Hungarian street pastry.
Let’s talk about wines! Hungary is not as well-known in comparison to France, Italy, or the Americas in terms of wines but that’s unfortunate because they have a really good selection of red and white wines that are produced locally. Here are some of them; Egri Bikavér or Bull’s Blood (my favorite) is a bold and dry red wine originated from Eger in northern Hungary, Tokaji Aszú or King of Wines is a famous dessert wine from Tokaji region that’s sweet and can be found in most restaurants in Hungary. Another drink that you can try is Pálinka which is not a wine, but a fruit brandy originated in Hungary and also popular throughout central Europe.
Although I loved Budapest, I was lucky enough to venture beyond the capital for a bit and went to Vác and Eger; two equally fun and memorable destinations to visit! Firstly, there’s Vác which is a great and quick getaway from Budapest that’s often overlooked. The quiet riverside town has enough attractions for a day-trip from Budapest and I loved my visit here. Some places to visit are the Vác Cathedral; a big beautiful church from the Baroque era built in the 11th century, the City Hall, White Church, strolling around the quaint main square and the riverside walkways, or simply checking out local restaurants and dessert shops.
Eger is well-known for its wines, natural thermal baths, and some historical landmarks. The city is beautiful and a unique blend of Christian and Turkish cultures which is visible in its architecture. While you’re here, don’t forget to visit Eger Castle & Museum, the Main Square, Minorite Church, Archbishop’s Garden, Turkish Minaret, and if you have time, definitely go to the Eger Thermal Bath (my favorite part of Eger!) and experience the healing sensation of Hungarian thermal bath. Another great spot to visit while you’re in Eger is Szépasszonyvőlgy or The Valley of the Beautiful Maidens, a popular venue for wine tasting that has below the surface rows of wine cellars where you can drink and buy some of Hungary’s best wines.
If you haven’t been to Budapest, you need to give it a go. Hungary’s capital is often overlooked because many people choose other popular destinations such as Paris, Rome, or Amsterdam. Although it has its flaws, I am so glad that my first European city is Budapest because I love the characteristics and the overall vibes. There are still so many things that I’d love to write about my travel to Budapest and surrounding cities (like my visit to the city of Debrecen, and bar/club hopping experience in Budapest). But I’ll save it for another blog post! ;)
Let me know if you have any questions or comments, I’d be happy to help you to have a great experience as you plan to travel to Budapest.

Hungary is so beautiful. It is in fact one of my ""first"" things in life. Back in 2006, when I boarded the first international flight of my life, it was destined for Budapest. The chartered plane ride from Vienna to Budapest was the most thrilling one. Cutting across winter clouds, when I first saw Budapest from over the air was enthralling. My stay there for few weeks has stayed afresh till this day.
Budapest, the heart of Hungary, is a city rich in history and culture. Among its must-visit attractions is the stunning Buda Castle, a historical castle and palace complex of the Hungarian kings, offering breathtaking views of the city. Another gem is the Parliament Building, a magnificent example of Neo-Gothic architecture, which is especially captivating when lit up at night. St. Stephen's Basilica, with its remarkable architecture and the panoramic view from its dome, is a sight to behold. For relaxation, Széchenyi Thermal Bath, the largest medicinal bath in Europe, provides a unique experience with its therapeutic waters and grand architecture.
For those who love the outdoors, Budapest offers delightful hiking opportunities. The Buda Hills, a short journey from the city center, are perfect for nature enthusiasts. Trails in the hills lead to places like János Hill, the highest point in Budapest, offering an unparalleled view of the city. The trek to Normafa, known for its scenic beauty and fresh air, is both refreshing and invigorating. This blend of urban charm and natural landscapes makes Budapest a multifaceted destination, promising unforgettable experiences to all who visit.

often there will be loads of empty seats but no-one sits in them, even when the tram is busy and all the less-able-to-stand people are sitting! I haven’t figured this one out yet.
is expected in any cafe, and some restaurants. it’s nice to be helpful!
they don’t switch to English, even if you speak it VERY badly. which is great when you want to practise. but potentially embarrassing… yesterday a barman got grumpy with me because I ordered two pints of Dreher (the local beer) but he somehow thought I meant two shots of whiskey, and then he wasn’t happy because he had to pour the shots back into the bottle… oops.
watch where you walk – or you’ll get dripped on.
no broccoli in any of the supermarkets. I’ve seen a couple of them hiding at fruit & veg markets, but never in any of the supermarkets. sad me 🥦
and even if it is broke, still don’t fix it. just put it in the hallway of your apartment block and you can guarantee someone’ll have nabbed it within the hour.
a lot of the greetings mean both hello and goodbye. which means you might hear “szia!” (pronounced like see ya) for hello, and “hallo!” for goodbye. not confusing at all.
made of actual wicker! and it’s not only the old ladies that use them – many other people do, too.
or any other type of coffee. they are just regular bars (without the espresso). also, loads of coffee shops also sell wine and cocktails and stay open til the evening. I like this.

Budapest was my last trip abroad before Covid hit and I’ve been missing these trips terribly. I’ve been traveling inside my own country for the past two years and I’m happy I’m privileged enough to do it despite this whole Covid mess, but I feel something is missing, so maybe writing and sharing will alleviate the itch.
Budapest was on my bucket list since I started a bucket list of places to visit and oh my… I only regret not staying for longer! Budapest is such a beautiful city with so many amazing places to visit and views that you could spend hours just admiring, specially at night when everything is illuminated.
Here goes my itinerary, information about the places I visited, the places I recommend for eating and the useful tips I wish someone had gave me.
I stayed at the Hotel Memories OldTown and I totally recommended it. The location is great, there are bus and tram stops just around the corner, and one of the main bus stops that connects to the airport is located 2min from the hotel (Kálvin tér M). Even though the hotel is located near a very busy street, most rooms face a totally quiet one, so no trouble sleeping. Breakfast was great, with options for all tastes, all fresh and some homemade. Room was big, super comfortable bed and all the typical amenities. There’s a spa center at the hotel with sauna, jacuzzi…

Nearly ten years ago, my husband and I lived in Budapest for a few months right after we were married. Every weekend, we’d pack our bags and visit a new European town or country. That was when the travel bug bit us. Fast forward to today, we were thrilled to have a wonderful opportunity to visit Budapest again. How could we possibly say no? This time, we wanted to take our son to the places where we made wonderful memories ten years ago. And of course, when you’re in Europe, visiting one city isn’t always enough. That’s how Bratislava and Vienna ended up on our itinerary as well.
Flights
First things first. To apply for a visa, you need confirmed round-trip tickets and hotel reservations for the travel dates. I know I’ve mentioned this before in my Kazakhstan blog, but it’s always worth repeating — look for cheaper flights from cities other than the one you reside in. We could have booked flights directly from Kozhikode to Budapest. But the layovers were long, which made the total travel time even longer, and the ticket prices were outrageous! The cheapest flight to Budapest from India was from Bangalore. The flight duration was shorter, and the layovers were minimal. So, we booked our flights from Bangalore. We flew to Bangalore from Kozhikode the day before and stayed overnight at a hotel near the airport. This turned out to be cheaper than booking a direct flight from Kozhikode (including both the flights to Bangalore and the hotel stay). And since we have a kid, it was much more convenient for him. Happy child = Happy Parents. It was a win-win. We booked the KLM flight from Bangalore to Budapest with a 1.5-hour layover in Amsterdam. We flew back to Bangalore from Budapest via Paris on Air France. Both flights were quite comfortable, and we had no complaints.
Stay
From our experience, Airbnb is the best stay option. It is cheaper than hotels and extremely spacious, and most rentals have a washer/dryer. That means you can carry fewer clothes and sleep in spacious rooms. Our son is a huge fan of Airbnb because of how spacious they are. Hotels simply cannot beat this offer. Of course, make sure you book an Airbnb rental with good ratings located near the city centre or one that is easily accessible via public transport.
Once our flights and accommodations were booked, the next step — the most dreaded of them all — was applying for a Schengen visa.
Schengen Visa
Let me be upfront — of all the visas I’ve applied for, the Schengen visa is the most complicated. I’m not joking when I say that one of the factors influencing the choice of our travel destinations is the complexity of the visa application process. All the countries we’ve visited in the past few years (post-COVID) have either had straightforward visa applications or were visa-free. But when the opportunity to travel back to Budapest came up around our ten-year wedding anniversary, we couldn’t say no, especially since we started our married life there.
I’m not going to go into detail about the visa application process, but I will mention a few things that helped us during our process.
To apply for a Schengen visa, you must submit your documents to the VFS application centre closest to your city of residence. We live in Kozhikode, and the nearest VFS centre that processes Schengen visas is in Kochi. However, we couldn’t find any suitable appointment dates in Kochi, so we decided to go with the next closest VFS centre — Bangalore. Coincidentally, we were planning a trip to Mysore during the Navratri holidays, so we extended our holiday to fit the visa appointment in Bangalore.
Before COVID-19, applying for a Schengen visa was simpler because we didn’t need an agent to help us block appointment dates. We could just log into our account on the VFS portal and pick the city, date, and time that suited us. This time, however, we couldn’t get any appointment dates when we tried to do it ourselves. It was disappointing because we took pride in managing our travel plans independently. In the end, we had to approach an agent to book an appointment, and to our surprise and eventual relief, the agent was able to get us dates that appeared unavailable on the portal. We finally got our dates, and they lined up perfectly with our Mysore holiday.
When you go for your visa appointment, it’s a good idea to bring extra documents beyond those listed on the VFS website. We carried copies of our marriage certificate, our son’s birth certificate, copies of our investments, all our old passports, and copies of all Schengen visas older than three years — documents that were not specifically required, but which the VFS centre appreciated us having. The VFS centre also has a photo booth (in case your photos don’t meet their standards), photocopy machines, and printers, just in case you forget to bring a document. So, it’s helpful to keep digital copies of all your documents so you can easily access and print them if needed.
We received our passports stamped with the visas within a few days of application.
Now, it was time to travel!
Our First Destination — Budapest
Although Amsterdam was our first port of entry into Europe, it was a short layover. After waiting through a long immigration line, we rushed to catch our connecting flight to Budapest.We reached Budapest at around 12 PM. Since we finished our immigration at our first port of entry — Amsterdam — we collected our luggage and passed through customs. We were to stay in Budapest for five days, visit Bratislava and Vienna, and then return to Budapest for a day before flying back to India. So, we purchased a two-week travel pass at the airport. This pass provides unlimited use of public transport (metro, bus, and tram) for 14 days in Budapest. There are also single tickets, one-day passes, three-day passes, and monthly travel passes, but sadly, no weekly passes. The two-week pass worked out to be the cheapest option for our 6-day overall stay. If you plan to stay in Budapest for more than three days, get the two-week pass. Don’t buy a three-day pass and then single-day passes for the extra days, as the price difference between the three-day and two-week passes is minimal. If you buy single tickets each time you use public transport, you’ll lose both time and money. One thing you should know about most European cities is that you will rarely need to use a taxi/cab. The public transport system is so well-connected that you’ll be constantly hopping on and off metros, buses, or trams throughout your stay. So, a travel pass makes more sense than individual tickets. Also, think of the time you’ll save. Imagine having to purchase a ticket every time you use public transportation. It simply does not make sense.
With the travel pass, we took the 200E bus to Kőbánya-Kispest M and then transferred to the M3 Metro line to get closer to our accommodation. We stayed in an Airbnb just a three-minute walk from Kalvin Square (Kálvin Tér) Metro station (this falls on the M3 metro line).
There is also a 100E bus that goes directly from the airport to the city centre, but this is the only transport service that is NOT included in the travel pass. Since we had the pass, we skipped it and took the 200E bus instead. The 200E bus stops just outside the airport exit. You don’t need to validate your two-week pass on the bus, but make sure to keep it with you at all times. There are regular checks, and you’ll need to show your pass if asked. Once we reached Kőbánya-Kispest M, we transferred to the M3 metro line and travelled to Kálvin Tér. At metro stations, there are no automated ticket validators. Instead, you’ll need to show your pass to the staff member near the escalators, who will quickly scan it before letting you through.
We reached our metro station, walked to our Airbnb, and self-checked in. After that, we took the day off to relax.
Getting a Local Sim
We made sure our international roaming was activated before we left India. We needed data for the first hours around the city since we did not want to buy a SIM card at the airport (expensive). We visited a local Vodafone store in the city the very next day and bought a local SIM. It was around INR 2500, which got us 6 GB of data for 30 days around Europe.
Sightseeing in Budapest
We travelled in November, which meant it was cold and there were fewer tourists — which worked to our advantage. However, the drawback was that we had to layer up every time we stepped out, which was frustrating the first few days, but later, we got used to it. We had three layers. Our regular clothes, a sweatshirt/sweater on top and a final jacket. We also had gloves, a scarf, and a beanie. We used regular walking shoes, which were quite enough since there was no snow or rain.
Places we visited in Budapest –
As with most of my travel blogs, I’m not going to dive into the details of our itinerary or write in detail about the places we visited. Instead, I’m going to simply list the places we explored each day. We traveled with our 4-year-old son, so if you’re wondering how many places you can cover with a kid in a day, this should give you a good idea.
Day 1 –
1. Hungarian Parliament Building Viewpoint
2. Mathias Church
3. Fishermen’s Bastion
4. Buda Castle and Old Town
5. Szechenyi Chain Bridge
Day 2 –
1. Gellert Hill (Closed due to renovation)
2. Vaci Utca — for shopping
3. Corvinus University
Day 3 –
1. Shoes on the Danube Bank
2. Central Market
3. Vajdahunyad Castle
4. Heroes Square
Day 4 –
1. Ferris Wheel of Budapest
2. Vaci Utca for the second time
3. Christmas Markets around the city
Day 5 –
Budapest to Bratislava
Our Second Destination — Bratislava
Our next stop was the city of Bratislava in Slovakia. We didn’t book any local travel in advance, so we visited the Keleti-Pályaudvar railway station in Budapest, a few stops away from where we stayed, and bought our train tickets to Bratislava just the day before leaving for Bratislava. This worked out cheaper for us. We also reserved seats by paying a little extra. This may not be necessary during the off-season because the trains are quite empty, and you can choose any seat, but during peak season, I suggest reserving seats. Kids under 6 travel for free! It took us 2.5 hours to reach Bratislava by train from Budapest.
We were staying in Bratislava for three days, so we bought the three-day travel pass at the railway station. The pass gives you unlimited bus and tram rides within the city. There is no metro in Bratislava, but trams and buses connect the station to the city centre. Make sure to validate your pass during your first ride. Once validated, it’s enough to do it just once, as the three days are counted from your first trip.
We stayed in an Airbnb very close to St. Michael’s Gate. The city is much smaller than Budapest, and most sightseeing within the city can be done on foot. However, visiting Devin Castle takes about 40 minutes by bus. You can use your travel pass for the bus ride there.
Places we visited –
1. Devin Castle (must visit for breathtaking views of the Danube) — Highly Recommended
2. Bratislava City Centre — St Stephen’s Gate, UFO tower, Bratislava castle
Our Third Destination — Vienna
We travelled from Bratislava to Vienna by bus. Again, we booked the bus tickets just the day before we left for Vienna. We did this online and took the Slovak Lines bus to Vienna Bus station. Remember, there are two stops in Vienna. The bus first stops at the airport and then at the central station. Make sure you book your tickets to the central station, not the airport. We were in Vienna for only a day and took the day pass at a metro station near the bus station where we were dropped off. The return buses back to Bratislava also leave from the same station.
Places we visited in Vienna –
1. Stephensplatz and St. Stephen’s Cathedral
Our Vienna tradition is to have Gelato in Stephensplatz and so, that’s what we did. We went to a place — Zanoni and Zanoni — that had Vegan gelato and also vegan Pizza. They also had egg-free chocolate croissants. We finished a quick lunch here and spent the rest of the day looking around Vienna.
2. Hofburg Palace
3. Maria Theresa Square
4. Christmas Markets
5. Belvedere Palace
We left Bratislava on the 19th and reached Budapest. On the last day in Budapest, we simply walked around Kalvin Square, did some shopping, and called it a day. On the morning of the 20th, we boarded the flight back to Bangalore.
Travel within Europe
Within the cities, we never used a Taxi. The airports are very well connected to the city centre by public transport (Metro, Bus and Tram). If you can walk, you won’t need a cab/taxi during any part of your journey. The cities are well connected by public transport.
For kids under 6, public transport was FREE in all three cities!
About Europe in General
Please be aware of your surroundings and do not fall for tourist scams. So far, the central and eastern European countries we’ve visited (Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia, Croatia) are not particularly known for scams. However, scams are more common in places like Italy, France, and Belgium — especially in capital cities and other popular tourist spots. There are several blogs online that discuss the various scams you may encounter, so please read up and stay informed before you travel. Scammers often try to distract you with something (such as asking you to sign a petition or attempting to give you a “free” gift), and while you’re distracted, another member of their group may pickpocket you or steal your bags.
Once in Paris, near Montmartre, we were approached by a girl who asked us to sign a petition for something. This is one of their most common scams. Our advice: just walk away and keep a tight grip on your bags. Also, don’t keep your phone or wallet in your pant pockets. Aravind was almost pickpocketed once but caught the girl in the act, and she quickly ran away. Luckily, he didn’t lose his wallet. The first incident happened in Paris, and the second in Rome. A third incident happened in Athens, where a lady approached me and offered me a free rose. Thankfully, I said no and left. It was only later that I realized this is another popular scam where people offer you free gifts, and once you accept them, they’ll ask for something in return. We encountered no such scams in the three cities we visited this time.
As for food, many vegan eateries can be found in the popular cities if you want to try local cuisine. In Budapest, I suggest you try Napfenyes Etterem — a vegan restaurant that serves local Hungarian cuisine. Make sure you try the Goulash soup! There are also plenty of Indian restaurants if you’re craving Indian food. We always look for Govinda’s — ISKCON’s restaurant. They have branches in several cities and if a city we’re travelling to has one, that’s where we frequent because our son prefers Indian food to local cuisine.
Overall, Europe is always a fantastic travel destination (if you manage to overcome the initial visa hurdle) because once you enter Europe, you have free reign to go anywhere, and everything is so well connected. Also, almost every shop closes by 6 pm. So make sure to do your shopping before then!
Happy travels!

“Almost dead yesterday, maybe dead tomorrow, but alive, gloriously alive, today.” — Robert Jordan, Lord of Chaos
I stepped off the busy burnt-yellow streetcar into a crisp grey late November evening. The bustle so prevalent throughout the centre of Budapest had ebbed away by the time I arrived at my stop. Now it just seemed like a sleepy Sunday afternoon in a small town. We were in Jozsefvaros, or the 8th district of the city, where we had arranged for an overnight staycation in a spa hotel.
We walked towards the hotel as my wife, who had grown up in Budapest, excitedly pointed out the high school she went to almost two decades before, which stood on a square just across from the hotel. It was beautiful in its old-world charm, as was the hotel which had recently been renovated but which originally served as a telecommunications office in the early twentieth century.
As we settled down in our room, I came across a coffee table book bearing black and…

Books to read:
Quick geography lesson:
Buda: on the hilly, leafy west side of the Danube river. The foothills have some apartment buildings… further up it’s full of glam villas. Traditionally more Catholic/royalist.
Pest: the flat, east side of the Danube. Full of apartment buildings, gritty side streets and broad avenues. Traditionally more Jewish, cosmopolitan and socialist.
Food and drink (mostly Pest):
Transport:
Trams are an ideal way to see the city, particularly #2 along the Pest side of the river and #6, which circles the ring road. DO buy a ticket, and, as in all tourist-engorged cities, do watch your wallet.
BOLT is a great app for affordable taxis. You can input start/end points and avoid trying to speak Hungarian. Works elsewhere in Central Europe too.
Buda/Pest highlights:
The “Castle District” on the west side of the Danube (Buda) is full of faux medieval architecture, monarchist pretense… skip it if your time is short. If you want to experience a fun conglomeration of scenes, start at the Bambi coffee shop (straight out of 1962), walk up the hill to Szell Kalman Ter (used to be Moszkva Ter, the tram hub where kids gathered during the 70s and 80s to plot their night escapades) to see the Mammut Mall (modern, erected on the site of an old train factory), the Fenyi Utcai Piac (farmer’s market in a modern/brutalist setting) and have a coffee at a cafe along the pedestrian Lovohaz utca and eat at Pingrumba (mentioned above.) From here, you can grab a #6 tram to head over to Pest…
Random stuff on the east (Pest) side is better. A quick tour below… if you start at roughly 12 o’clock on the clock dial, this zigzags around to 6 o’clock. Most of this stuff — with the exception of the city market — is within 5–10 minutes walk of other points.
Budapest, the melting pot:
Pronunciation:
After returning from Hungary, should you talk about your visit to “Budapesht” (mimicking Hungarian, which turns “s” into “sh”) or “Budapest” (phonetically in English)? Many tourists affect the former pronunciation — which is odd, because almost nobody talks about their trips to “Paree” or “Roma,” right? (I confront the same problem when referring to Indianapolis, which residents universally call “Indy,” when I’m outside in Indiana.)
An hour away:
And a friend’s notes on Prague. Notes on Budapest’s rising prices for tourists. Online resources: LikeLocals.

It’s been a few days since we left the city of Budapest but since we’re still on the road roaming through Transylvania, writing articles takes me longer than usual. And so does editing videos.
We’ve taken lots of footage on this trip so far and I decided to break up the clips. Here’s the video now of our first part of the journey.
And in case you didn’t read the articles about our stay in the city you can do it now.

Probably due to the fact I part time live in Hungary, I am often asked about Budapest. So here are my takes and suggestions!
Budapest is a big city with several district articles containing sightseeing, restaurant, nightlife and accommodation listings.Budapest (Hungarian pronunciation approximates to “boo-dah-pesht”) is the capital city of Hungary. With a unique, youthful atmosphere, a world-class classical music scene as well as a pulsating night life increasingly appreciated among European youth and, last but not least, an exceptionally rich offering of natural thermal baths, Budapest is one of Europe’s most delightful and enjoyable cities. Due to its scenic setting and its architecture it is nicknamed “Paris of the East”.
In 1987 Budapest was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List for the cultural and architectural significance of the Banks of the Danube, the Buda Castle Quarter and Andrássy Avenue.
I am obsessed by the Fisherman Bastion …in a photographic sort of way. The proximity with one of my favourite patisserie does the rest!
I know they are new, I know they do not mean or serve much I still love them!
Located in the historic district of Castle Hill, the Fisherman’s Bastion (or Halászbástya) is a neo-Gothic terrace that looks like a structure taken straight out of a fairytale. Designed and built between 1895 and 1902, next door — Fisherman’s Bastion is named after the medieval guild of fishermen who protected Budapest from invasion.
The gleaming white structure provides panoramic views of the city: From here, you can snap some breathtaking pictures of the Danube, Margaret Island and Pest. You may choose to take some time to explore the bastion’s seven ornate turrets, which symbolize the tents of the seven Magyar tribe leaders who settled the Carpathian Basin, ultimately leading to the existence of modern-day Hungary.
Andrassy Utca is one of the most beautiful avenues in Budapest. The big green trees and the high end fashion stores give it an elegant vibe. Very nice to walk along it.It is a lovely wide avenue for a stroll. There are lots of restaurants and international clothing chains, high end on the street. The Opera is here and on the day I was walking they were making a period movie. It was nice to watch. Several places for coffee and of course, the clothing chain COS is here. If you walk to the end you will pass the Terror House and wind up at the big city park with the zoo.
A soak in a thermal bath is a quintessential Budapest experience (it hasn’t cultivated a reputation as the “City of Spas” for nothing). These baths, or fürdok in Hungarian, are heated by natural thermal springs and usually include on-site massage services, as well as steam rooms. There is no other bath as the Széchenyi Baths!!! The Geller are pretty do not get me wrong but you can find similar or better anywere in the world!
SZÉCHENYI BATHS
One of the last remnants of the Turkish influence in Hungary, a visit to the thermal baths is a quintessential Budapest experience. I haven’t visited all of the baths in Budapest, but I have been to several of the most famous Budapest baths and the grandiose Széchenyi Baths are by far my favourite. Early morning or just before sunset is my favourite times for a soak in the thermal, healing waters of Széchenyi’s outdoor pools.
…and discover why Budapest is called the Pearl of the Danube!
Ah, the Chain Bridge — one of my very favourite bridges in the world. It was the first bridge to permanently connect Buda and Pest and was completed in 1849. At the time, the Chain Bridge was considered to be one of the wonders of the world and the architect was so immensely proud of his work that he challenged anyone to find fault with the bridge. It is said that when it was discovered that the lions that stand guard at either end are missing their tongues, the architect committed suicide.
The Great Market Hall in central Budapest is Budapest’s most famous marketplace.
Whilst many locals still use the market hall as a place to buy their groceries, the market is incredibly popular with the tourists too.
Locally grown fruits and veg, and locally sourced meats are found on the lower floors, and souvenirs including lace, chess sets and leather goods are available in the upper floors.
As well as individual ingredients, it is possible to pick up homemade local delicacies like goulash and langos from the food stall upstairs.
Budapest is full of cafes to have a delicious cuppa joe and try one of the sweets Budapest is famous for. Cafe Ruszwurm, on the Castle Hill, is one of Budapest’s oldest traditional confectioners still operating as a cafe.
it is very cosy and small, has just about a dozen seats, There is a wide selection of the day’s fresh pastries, truffles, and coffee concoctions to choose from. The decor is charming too with antique furniture and tools of the old confectionery trade in the glass curio cabinets.
Cafe Ruszwurm is located at Szentháromság u. 7 and is open 9am — 8pm Spring through Fall and 10am — 7pm in Winter.
Completed in 1904, the Hungarian Parliament Building is one of Budapest’s most famous landmarks. The National Assembly of Hungary still meets there to this day. Travelers come mainly to take in the building’s architecture (primarily Gothic Revival style), beautiful statues and paintings, and national significance. According to many, there is no structure in Hungary that serves as a better symbol of the country’s independence and commitment to democracy.
Heroes’ Square (or Hosök tere) is one of Budapest’s grandest landmarks as well as the largest public square in the city. Swing by this area to take a picture of the Millenium Monument which was erected in 1896 to celebrate Hungary’s 1000th anniversary.
The square and the monument are dedicated to “the memory of those heroes who gave their lives for the freedom of our people and our national independence.” At the base of the famous column (topped with the archangel Gabriel) are statues representing seven Magyar chieftains — considered to be the founders of the Hungarian nation. Behind the column are matching colonnades with 14 statues of royalty and other important figures in Hungarian history.
This funicular, which first opened in 1870, is the second oldest funicular of its kind in the world. A system of weights and counterweights is used to help to raise the carriages up and down the hill. The funicular is the fastest way to get to the top of Castle Hill, and is exceedingly popular because of its panoramic views out across the Danube. (You can also get there with this Segway tour)
The speed of ascent was actually slowed down as of 1988, to give passengers more time to enjoy their ride. The track is open daily until 10pm, so it is also a great way to enjoy views of Pest at night.
This stretch of the Danube walkway goes from the Elizabeth Bridge to the Chain Bridge, and is perfect for those who want a short, but interesting walk. Promenading along the Danube is a great way to see many of the most famous sights in the capital.
Looking over towards to Buda side of the river, you will see the Buda Castle, the Liberty Statue on Gellert Hill and the Fisherman’s Bastion. On the Promenade side of the river, you can enjoy restaurants, cafes, Szechenyi Istvan Square and a range of different sculptures, including the Little Princess
Located on Vörösmarty Square and dating back to 1858, Gerbeaud is one of Budapest’s most famous spots to get delicious desserts. Unlike at the other spots, here I have three recommendations. Firstly, the Dobos Torte as they bake it is the very best…secondly because it’s Emil Gerbeaud that gave the world the Gerbeaud slice (also written as ‘Zserbó szelet’), we suggest the rethought/reworked version of this Hungarian favourite: the Gerbeaud Sundae. While it’s quite pricey (2550 HUF + service fee), it’s a huge dessert that’s practically a meal. Two scoops of walnut sponge, one scoop of chocolate ice-cream, two scoops of walnut ice-cream, chocolate sauce, apricot sauce, crispy walnut linzer, whipped cream and apricot foam, topped with a small Gerbeaud slice. It’s super sweet, yet the perfect mix of old and new, cake and cream, warm and cold. Secondly, we recommend the classic cake served with vanilla ice-cream and the legendary ‘cat’s tongue.’
Sissy, wife of Emperor Franz Joseph and Queen of Hungary always dropped in the Gerbeaud cafe when she was in Budapest.
MY SUPER FAVOURITE REMAINS THE DOBOS TORTE!!!
I like very much the idea and feeling of sipping a cafe while surrounded by books and magazines.
The building shows some wonderful neo-renaissance characteristics, especially when we’re drinking a hot black coffee in the room decorated with Lotz Károly’s murals. Used to be my favourite with a superb coffee place, sadly the coffee has closed, Bookshop is great
39 Andrássy út ·Website
Once the residence of Manó Mai (1855–1917), photographer ro the imperial court, this 120-year- old listed building houses an exhibition hall, the Sunlight Atelier, bookshop and library.

This is the main English language bookstore of Budapest. They offer decent prices and a large selection of travel books, both for Hungary and the other countries. You can find unique gifts for the book lovers in your life at Bestsellers. Street & River loves this place!
11 Október 6. St Website
It’s a little quiet island in the heart of the city with great coffee and tasty, homemade cakes, cute service and a wide range of foreign language books.
30 Nagy Diófa ut. Website
They seem to have everything…..except a coffee place!
1072 Budapest Rákóczi út 12.
I strongly believe in Budapest like in most of Mittel/Eastern Europe you can eat well and genuinely with 4/7 Euro. The places below reflect this feeling and are my favourites. You can have a meal with 900–1600 HUF
Our favourite restaurant during the stays in Budapest. The portions are huge at a decent price (and you can always ask for a smaller portion for 70% of the price!). The lovely home-made lemonade is a mix of lemon, orange and basil which is super refreshing and you can order a half a litre of it. Their goulash is superb as well as the
The service is always really nice too, answering all the questions we had about the dishes. Family and friendly staff. This is where you can find us in the evening when we are in the Capital!
Budapest, Hold u. 11, 1054 Hungary
This place is a cheap place to eat traditional, and not only. It;s a buffet type, and not a traditional restaurant, and I think it’s a bit underrated, compared to the very overrated and expensive “City Market” restaurant choices — this place is just around the corner from the City Market, and has the same nice dishes, for less money — and you always have a place to sit and eat, unlike the market. We live very close when in Budapest so it is our fav lunch place
Lonyay utca 7, Budapest 1093, Hungary
A new find, next to the beer owned Kaltenberg Restaurant. It is very nice and modern, Staff is attentive and the food is good!
Kinizsi utca 30–36 1092 Budapest, Hungary
Address: Október 6. utca 14., v. district, M3 blue metro, Arany János utca stationOpen: 11.30–20.00 dailyTel: (+36 1) 269 3861
A simple, inexpensive cash-only eatery with only 5–6 tables (prepare to share the table with other guests). If you want to try hearty Hungarian food this the place to go. Menu in English is available.
Daily menu (soup + main dish or főzelék + meat or sausage) from around HUF 800 -1 200. Try mushroom paprikash with galuska, or máglyarakás (a typical local sweet treat: layers of sliced crescents, apples, apricot jam, with meringue on top and baked in oven.
Address: Jókai utca 20., VI. district, M3 blue metro, Nyugati pályaudvar stationOpen: Mon-Fri: 11.30–22.00, Sat: 11.30–16.00, Sun: ClosedTel (+36 1) 312 0557, website
A pretty good-value, cheap restaurant in Budapest’s downtown, close to the Opera, with a daily menu of two options (a couple of soups, mains, and desserts): for 890 HUF (two courses), or 990 HUF (three courses).Soups: Újházy chicken broth — 530 HUF, bean soup with pork knuckle: 960 HUF,Mains to try: pork rib gipsy style with fries (Cigánypecsenye): 1555 HUF, Hagymás rostélyos ( rump steak with fried onions and fries): 1795 HUF,Desserts: pancakes (túrós=sweet cottage cheese, walnuts and chocolate sauce, jam): 420–515 HUF (two pieces), Chestnut puree with whipped cream (gesztenyepüré): 685 HUF.
Address: Bajcsy-Zsilinszky E. út 15. , district V.
Despite the touristy location, Lugas is a fairly good place right behind St. Stephen Basilica. You can sit at the terrace if the weather allows. They serve mostly typical Hungarian meals:

It’s the first of October and I’m in one of the most beautiful cities in all of Europe. I walked nearly 20 miles today through 2,000 years of history: through the overthrow of kingdoms and empires, the fall of communism, the rise of capitalism, the evidence of centuries-old glitz, and the stories of human survival and defeat… and through it all, Budapest (pronounced Boo-da-pesht) has held its head high.
The bus ride from the airport last night took me past lights illuminating modern outlet malls. Giant billboards stood above a newly paved highway for Pizza Hut, NewYorker clothing, a Mercedes dealer, mattress stores and diamond merchants. Was this right? Had I just landed in Hungary? I was expecting sturdy grandmothers, about as wide as they were high, slinging potato sacks into communist-built trucks, clothed in brown, and selling unevenly carved salt blocks on the side of a dirt road. But this looked like I was riding past a strip mall in middle America.
We left the outskirts and were soon in the city proper: Baroque, Gothic, Classical and Art Nouveau architecture… it was like Prague, only the streets were wider and the buildings a touch more opulent. We pulled into downtown, and what I’d later learn to be the Pes(shh)t side of the city where a giant white Ferris wheel, a replica of the London Eye, stood next to the Danube River and a purple-lit Chain Bridge.
I exited the bus and walked down a narrow cement canyon made up of 5-story high buildings. Drunk college kids staggered and laughed in packs, weaving their way down the sidewalk. It was a Monday, but may as well have been a Saturday night- it was like walking through the East Village in Manhattan. Graffiti was scribbled on old decaying buildings, giving it that mysterious post-communist look. Dark alleyways and shuttered store fronts looked like part of an intended stage set. Kids covered in tattoos smoked cigarettes in doorways and wandered into crumbling ‘Ruin’ bars (pop-up bars with antique furniture and communist paraphernalia in abandoned buildings) before hitting the late-night pizza parlors, pianos bars, or even taco stands. I’d later learn I was just a few blocks from the big tourist draw of Saint Stephen’s Cathedral, down from the Four Seasons, the Ritz, and the Parliament. Luxury was mixed with disintegrating alleyways; it was all part of the city’s pallet.
I found my Air BnB, after having walked past it twice, tucked away between a furniture store and a construction site, located on one of the uprooted side streets in the Jewish Quarter. The cement walls on the exterior and in the open courtyard were crumbling, a patchwork of grey filler smeared the walls in no particular pattern. Chicken wire caged the mineshaft-like elevator, which was surrounded by a spiral staircase. There was a central area between the buildings that opened to the sky where trash was kept and laundry hung from railings. Red ivy cascaded alongside large cracks that ran the building like deep scars: another perfect backdrop for an East Berlin spy movie and no wonder it was $35 a night.
The inside of the apartment, though, could have been a museum: 2 old-fashioned typewriters, an antique sewing machine, gilded mirrors, fedoras hanging from walls, and half a canoe posing as a bookshelf. The place was big, maybe 800sq ft, with 12’ ceilings. During the day, light would pour in from double-paned windows and every once in awhile there would be a burst of pigeons, like fireworks over the rooftops, visible through the windows. In the living room, old wooden oars hung curtains and in the bathroom, antique golf clubs hung towels.
I looked down at my phone to see how many miles I had clocked walking through the city that day: 19.3. No wonder I was exhausted. Making my way into the apartment, I searched for anything edible in the old-fashioned kitchen. A bar of chocolate and an apple were propped up against an Italian espresso Moka Pot. Caffeine, an apple, and more caffeine? It looked like it was time to track down some authentic Hungarian cousine… would pizza count?
The night before I had ridden the massive white ferris wheel to get a view of the city from above, then photographed the beautifully lit Chain Bridge. I grabbed pizza (it rivaled New York City’s) and ice cream and sat watching the crowds flow in and out of the square in front of Saint Stephen’s Cathedral.
I read somewhere that this city can be substituted in films for Moscow, Paris, Berlin, Rome, and even Buenos Aires. 4 historical periods are visible in the architecture, including 1st Century Roman ruins next to Buda Castle and medieval buildings at one of the bath houses. The city just feels familiar- like I’ve been here before and have been waiting unknowingly to come back.
In the morning, I went for a run over to the Buda side where the Buda Castle is. The lush rolling hills of Buda (previously a separate city from Pest) includes gorgeous lookouts of the city from Fisherman’s Bastion: neo-Romanesque architecture with a view of the Parliament across the Danube. I did a 3hr historical (free) walking tour later and learned that Hungarians prefer the term Central Europe, not Eastern Europe; that post-communism is a mixture between democracy and communism; that the Turks brought the bath houses, coffee houses, and even paprika here over 500 years ago; that the Austro-Hungarian empire (post 1867) had a shared capital between Vienna and Budapest. (Each city tried to outdo the other in architecture and panache resulting in a building boom that made most of the city’s grandiose buildings of today.) And interestingly, 70% of Europe’s gold is from Hungary, which may explain the demand for the region and its prosperity.
I wandered back and forth over the 3 bridges, visiting the Parliament and an art instillation from 2005 called Shoes on the Danube River (a memorial of shoes left behind by Jews during WWII who were shot into the Danube. The shoes had been worth more than the people and they’d been instructed to remove them ahead of time). Learning about historical tragedies like these (over 600,000 Jews were killed in Hungary during WWII) and the rise and fall of the many kingdoms, empires, and modern governments had me in a trance, the crunch of pebbles under my feet, the feel of the leather shoes against my fingers. I stared across the river to the Buda side with its rolling hills and castles, the crisp fall air wrapping around me like a hug from an old friend.
As the sun dipped below the horizon, I made my way to the 1888 Baroque-style Turkish Baths at Széchenyiin City Park, my towel and swimsuit stuffed in my backpack. For the equivalent of $7, I had the use of all the mineral pools of varying temperatures from ice cold plunges to naturally hot pools, saunas and steam rooms. Faucets on ancient pipes in the sauna could be turned on to refill your water bottle, which reminded me of the fire hydrants around the city that also have a device allowing people to refill with delicious tap water. Water was flowing from everywhere, I had never seen anything quite like it.
When I got here 2 nights ago, I had known almost nothing about Budapest. I came because of a $49 airfare from Paris and a spare two days. Getting off that plane and riding into a worn yet opulent city that faces a fairy tale of castles and palaces across a winding river had me more fascinated than I expected; I knew immediately that 2 days wouldn’t be enough.
One thing I’m embarrassed about is that I didn’t experience Hungarian food. The immigrant cultures of Turkish and Italian were so prominent, with gyro shops and pizza restaurants everywhere, there wasn’t much of a draw to heavy Hungarian food. Still, I did learn the importance of Paprika (a mild pepper powder) in every dish- like in goulash (pronounced gulyas) and paprikash. Onions, garlic, potatoes, paprika and bacon make the basis for most Hungarian dishes, which run close to 3,000 calories per serving.
Another interesting tidbit is that the 500-year-old coffee culture, brought in by the Ottoman Empire, had created more than 400 cafes by the 19th Century. Intellectuals and writers would gather, chain smoking and waxing poetic in their caffeinated excitement. The culture was squashed by the communists after WWII, but it’s made a comeback since their independence in 1989. Coffee ‘take away’ and drip coffee isn’t very popular, so chains like Starbucks and McCafe have adjusted by serving espresso in china teacups.
As I rode the bus back out to the airport, a day and a half after my arrival, the scene looked more familiar in the light and more reasonable than my initial assessment. Of course there would be malls outside of this bustling city with English billboards- Hungarian is one of the top 5 most difficult languages in the world after all. With communism over, this country had sprung at the opportunity to connect with the capitalist west- and they play the part well.
Budapest, known as the Paris of the east, should be on everyone’s bucket list; I know I can’t wait to return.

Budapest is only one hour flight from Frankfurt. I have heard so many great reviews of the city that I decided it was time to visit the capital of Hungary.
Jacob had a birthday on the 10th of October and I decided to surprise him by flying with him to Budapest for three days. Turned out, it was a fantastic present for both of us.
In the BUD airport, I withdrew local forints from an ATM, bought my 3-day Budapest public transportation ticket, and off we went to the city center by bus.
It turned out the only time I needed cash was when I used city toilets. All the restaurants, cafes, museums, and parking garages accept credit cards.
On the second thought, we found another use for unspent forints. More about it in the next story about the city.😉
Our apartment was located in a beautiful and grandiose building erected at the beginning of the 20th century, at the time when modern Hungary was a part of the powerful Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.
The apartment was located in a mostly flat Pest part of the capital, just 10 minutes walking distance away from the Hungarian Parliament building. From there, we could enjoy fantastic views of the hilly Buda and Obuda parts of the city, located across the Danube River.

We arrived in Budapest yesterday afternoon. It took quite a bit to get here from Wisconsin but that’s for another post. Our travels went as planned and we stepped on to the Viking Longship we were traveling on around 2 o’clock in the afternoon.
After drinks, dinner, and partially unpacking in our stateroom, I dragged my husband across town to walk over the famous Chain Bridge at night to get a much-wanted, even required, photograph of the Budapest Parliament Building.
It and other buildings in Budapest are beautifully illuminated at night, as are the bridges that span the Danube River in that part of Hungary.
Walking from our boat, between the Liberty Bridge and the Elizabeth Bridge, to the Parliament Building was at least a couple of miles. After traveling on a plane for most of the last day, walking was a welcome relief.
My husband and I are big walkers on vacation. We enjoy it.
Before we got to the Chain Bridge, we had beautiful views of Buda Castle high on the Budapest side of the Danube. Again, gorgeous!

It was the summer of 2015. My husband and I travelled to Budapest with our son and his better half.
Our three-day trip to the city was the most enjoyable and unforgettable. Budapest has a distinct charm, and its glorious setting astride the Danube River makes it a great place to visit.
The Budapest vacation helped us to build lifelong memories and break away from the usual hectic routine. It allowed us to enjoy a new culture, food and experiences.
The Szenchenyi chain bridge spans the river Danube between Buda on the western side and Pest on the eastern side. It is a permanent bridge across the Danube in Hungary. A series of bridges connect Buda and Pest.
Budapest is the most beautiful city on the Danube. The city’s panorama is breathtaking, and you can enjoy the most when on a cruise ship.
The best part of the tour was taking a cruise down the Danube, passing landmarks like the National Parliament and Buda Castle. It was an incredible experience!
Especially in the evening hours when you get to see the illuminated parliament. You get to enjoy the complimentary welcome drink as you take in the sights of the city.
The Liberty bridge is the southernmost public road bridge in Budapest. It is the shortest bridge in the centre of Budapest.
Our Funicular ride to the Buda Castle was enjoyable. You get a captivating view of the city below.
Buda Castle is a remarkable castle. The National Gallery, National Library and the History Museum are located inside this castle. It sits on the top of the castle hill.
We enjoyed the old-fashioned pastry shops and many good cafes and restaurants — a must-see place for anyone visiting Budapest.
Every colourful dish was equally inviting, and it was difficult to resist the temptation to gobble them all up!
The Dohany Synagogue was very close to our Airbnb. It is the largest European synagogue and has a seating arrangement for nearly 3000 people.
You can see travellers clicking pictures of the interior. You get to see the brilliant Tohrah Ark made of coloured and golden geometric shapes.
The weeping willow tree is in the synagogue's backyard. It has metal leaves on which family names of Hungarian Jews murdered in the Holocaust are carved.
On the last day of our stay, we visited the St Gerard Sagredo statue. It is one of the historical landmarks in Budapest.
The views from this place on top of the hill are stunning — one of the most visited attractions in Budapest.
Heroes Square is one of the major squares in Budapest. It has the museum of fine arts on the left and the Palace of art on the right.
The central feature is the Millennium memorial. The two colonnades behind the monument each have seven statues representing significant figures of Hungarian history.
“Travelling in the company of those we love is home in motion.”- Leigh Hunt.
The most significant benefit of family travel is bonding with the dearest people in your life and exploring places together.
Every year we look forward to family travel, visiting a new place, exploring and creating memories.

I wouldn’t classify myself as spontaneous. I always like to evaluate and ponder big decisions or dilemmas before taking any action. That being said I am becoming more aware of the privilege that being in my early 20s affords me. I am not settled in a specific place, have no real commitments apart from my work and no one yet depends on me to live their life. I find stating this particularly freeing, it is good to be able to make last-minute plans with friends and this is a luxury that is only typically afforded at the start and end of your life. However, this is not something I usually take advantage of and most recently I have been wanting to utilize it as I know I will miss it as life progresses.
In the company I work at, we have an internal shop slack channel where people can buy or sell goods. Last month, my friend spotted last-minute plane tickets being sold a week in advance for a weekend getaway to Budapest and naturally he suggested that we go. I was originally unsure about this, I wanted to spend this weekend achieving some tasks before climbing in Portland. But naturally, something in my mind told me to use this privilege in my life and go on the trip. So somewhat apprehensively I agreed! This blog is going to go over our adventure in Budapest!
Day 1
Our departing flight left at 8 am, so this meant a 5 am starting journey to Luton airport (thanks Ben for driving us). I typically don’t like taking early morning flights but I really enjoyed the experience of waking up early and being in another country by lunchtime.
Our flight landed just after lunch, and after getting through the terrible queues for passport control (thank you Brexit!) we got a bus and metro into town and picked out a great brunch spot for lunch called cookie beacon. This was a great restaurant to eat, it catered for Ben’s burger craving and my gluten allergy. They also had keto cookies, which were really good and filling. During this time we outlined what we wanted to achieve on this trip, where we wanted to go and the experiences we wanted to have.
We first headed into central Budapest (on the Pest side of the river) to check out a thermal bath. We decided that as it was a Friday, this was the best time to try and go to avoid it being overcrowded. We chose the Széchenyi Thermal Bath, while it is more expensive than some of the other baths it looked much better and was located in a lovely area near the central park. I would definitely recommend checking out a bath while in Budapest, while it is not on the level of the Blue Lagoon in Iceland they don’t have the eggy smell that sulphur baths have and unlike a swimming pool, they get very warm.
One word of advice is to make sure you bring your own flip-flops to these baths, most require you to wear them and the prices they charge for them are extortionate!
After spending the afternoon in the bath, we took a walk back to the Airbnb we picked out and cooked up some dinner, excited to make the most of our time in the country.
Day 2
As this was our only full day in Budapest we wanted to make the most of it. We decided to take an early morning walking tour of Budapest. These are pretty common in Europe, they are free to sign up for and the tour guide will expect tips at the end. I always enjoy taking these types of tours when a visit a new city, they are a great way to see as much of the city as you can and they provide much-needed context to any attractions.
We had a great tour guide (thanks Regina!), and some highlights for me included the St. Stephen’s Basilica church, the USSR and Nazi monuments and the Hungarian Parliament building. Regina was incredibly knowledgeable about all the sites we stopped off at and gave some great recommendations for clubs and bars in Budapest to visit.
One interesting moment for me during the tour was the Nazi monument. This monument was created in memory of the Nazi invasion and subsequent occupation of Hungary. As Regina explained to us, this statue has potential implications that Hungary is absolved from collaboration with the Nazi government and the actions that they took. As a result, this is a controversial attraction for some, especially Jewish Hungarians.
After taking the tour we grabbed some lunch and then walked across the river to Buda to visit the castle, stopping to take some scenic pictures of the Hungarian parliament building from the river.
To end our day we decided to double down on our spontaneity and go to a bar and club. We received a great piece of advice from Regina to visit the Szimpla Kert ruin bar, these ruin bars are built from bombed buildings in WW2. Instead of being rebuilt, they were minimally converted into bars and make for a really nice setting as they have a lot of natural light and character to them.
We ended our day with a night out at the Instant-Fogas Complex club. Clubbing is not something that I do often as in the past I have not had enjoyable experiences, but in the spirit of this holiday, I thought I would give it another go. Surprisingly we had a great time, even catching the closing stages of a Hungarian rock concert before the dancefloor started getting busy.
Day 3
After enjoying ourselves the night before we decided to have a lazy morning. We grabbed coffee at Anna’s cafe in the centre near the river and then relaxed in Elizabeth Square. At lunchtime, we headed back to the airport to catch our flight home.
Conclusions
Overall this was a really special trip for me. It took me outside of my comfort zone for the first time in a while and also took me away from my regular schedule. It felt really good to be spontaneous and I loved the trip. Budapest is a wonderful city full of beauty, character and history. Is it hard to comprehend coming from Britain that within the space of 70 or so years, Hungary has known 3 different types of political systems. It opens your mind and after all, that is the beauty of travelling, to take yourself out of your bubble and experience another country’s culture and educate yourself on their history.
Usually, I am very keen on planning out a schedule when going abroad, but during this trip I allowed myself to relax and let the plans get made as and when we chose to. There was something very freeing and relaxing about this. This was only possible as I had such good friends with me, I could trust that I could be honest with them and we had each other best interests at heart.
Overall this trip has been an amazing experience and I can’t wait to go on another weekend trip, spontaneous or not!

It was early on Thursday morning.
Neither my dad nor I got a good night’s sleep.
My father ate something which evidently didn’t agree with him.
While I was jittery with a mixture of anxiety and excitement.
Excited because I was about to visit a part of the world I’d never been to before:
Eastern Europe.
Prior to this experience, I’d never stepped foot in Eastern Europe before.
Sure, technically speaking, Istanbul is in Eastern Europe.
And I’d also been to Greece as a kid.
But this was different.
For the first time in my life, I’d be venturing deep into the land of the iron curtain.
I’d heard so much about this part of the world, and in modern times it’s been described as a European paradise.
All the benefits of capitalism while maintaining its traditional roots.
Something I wish I could say the same about Britain.
So yes, I was excited.
But I was also anxious.
Not about the journey, but about something else.
Namely my love life.
But I’ll save that for day 3.
Stick around and keep reading this series if you’d like to know what happens.
Either way, I barely got any sleep before our flight and was absolutely knackered.
I woke up around 8 and got ready for the taxi’s arrival at 9.
Everything was going according to plan.
We left the house at 9AM and zoomed off to the airport.
Despite the airport being miles away, we got there in just 45 minutes.
0 traffic = 0 problems.
The airport too was a walk in the park.
We checked our bags in with zero problems and got through security without a single hiccup.
I was a little nervous about the sheet of paper I’d been given by the immigration beaurea.
It didn’t look super legit and I wasn’t sure if I’d be turned away at passport control.
Thankfully, I didn’t and everything was cool.
We find our gate and chill out in the seats.
After a few minutes of listening to music and playing chess, we were ready to board the plane.
We queue up and see something strange…
Some people are being escorted out of the line and are being told some awful news.
Me and my dad looked at each other, puzzled.
What could possibly be going on?
Turns out, some people weren’t given any seats to board the plane!
It seems Budapest is quite a popular destination.
Thank goodness we had the foresight to check-in online prior to arriving at the airport, otherwise it would have been us who’d be escorted out of the line.
With a sigh of relief and a few empathetic looks, we were on the plane and seated.
The flight flew by in a flash as I slept through all of it.
2 hours later, we were in Budapest and ready to start our Eastern European adventure.
I’d done some research and was clued up on what to do once arriving at the airport.
We did all the formal stuff like going through passport control and picking up our bags.
Next came the fun part:
Finding our way into the city.
Me and my dad each bought a 15 day transport pass which allowed us unlimited access on every transportation in the city for… you guessed it, 15 days.
I had a look online and people were saying there was a week pass, but they’ve clearly changed it.
Either way, we grabbed one of those (called a 15-Day Budapest Pass) and made our way to the bus stop.
The plan was to get the 100E bus which would take us straight into the city centre.
We would have done this if it weren’t for the fact that our Budapest pass isn’t valid for that particular bus (typical).
I asked one of the conductors what to do and he told us we could get the 200E bus that would take us to where we needed to go.
Sweet!
I picked up a map and started doing some high IQ geographical calculations in my head.
I love this about going to a new place.
There’s a certain thrill about figuring out how to find your way around.
I do this everywhere I go.
When I first lived in Istanbul, I would always be hopping on different buses/tubes and exploring.
When I moved to London, I’d spend months venturing into the city centre and finding my way round.
Budapest was no exception.
We got on the 200E bus and ended up at the closest Metro station (Kőbánya-Kispest).
This was our first taste of Hungary, and I’m not gonna lie, it was weird.
A lot of the advertising was similar to the stuff you’d see in rural Turkey, except with a European twist.
Instead of a woman in a headscarf advertising a homemade pide restaurant, we had juiced up Europeans advertising a local supplement company.
The buildings were a mix of modern monstrosities and Soviet era crumblings.
It wasn’t until we entered the city of Budapest that I was faced with the sheer beauty of humanity’s potential.
There was also a moment where a homeless guy walked onto the bus and stunk the place up.
It brought me back to a sunny Spring day in Sheffield where a man who hadn’t showered in months had everyone gasping for fresh air with his stench.
Not exactly the warmest welcome…
From Kőbánya-Kispest we took the blue M3 Metro line to Ferenciek Tere.
If you’re curious, this is right into the centre of Pest and just a minutes walk from the Danube.
In hindsight, we didn’t need to go to this station as Deak Ferenc Ter (the stop before it) would have helped us get to our desired destination a lot faster.
Even so, we learnt this later on after some research.
From Ferenciek Tere we walked on the main street up towards Astoria and eventually reached Blaha Lujza Ter (where our hotel and subsequently our AirBNB was).
On our walk, we got our very first look at Budapest.
And honestly?
I was a little underwhelmed.
Lots of homeless people.
A strange smell in the air (mostly urine).
Much fewer Hungarians than I had pictured.
And it was absolutely scorching hot.
No doubt, this was my fault.
I had this idea of Hungary being a European bastion of beauty.
I expected everything to be pristine, clean and perfect.
With those kinds of high standards, I was bound to be met with some dissapointment.
If you’re Hungarian and reading this, don’t be offended.
I love Budapest.
I just want to give you my honest first impressions before fully discovering the true beauty of the city.
After a few minutes of walking, I noticed something concerning.
My dad was limping.
And he wasn’t limping a little, he was limping quite heavily.
He’d mentioned the night before our flight that he had a pain in his foot, and clearly the pain hadn’t subsided.
I asked him if he was alright and he grimaced back, “I’m fine, just get a bloody move on”.
I heard the man and we marched on towards our hotel.
We didn’t have to march long as within a few minutes were outside our hotel in the middle of town.
It was a really weird hotel.
Looked utterly rubbish on the outside, but the inside was as lavish as you could possibly imagine.
It’s called the Atrium Fashion Hotel and it’s located on Csokonai utca, one street behind the Blaha Lujza ter Metro station.
If you want to visit Budapest, I think you’d enjoy your time at this hotel.
Our room was cosy, the hotel staff were extremely helpful and friendly (Hi Adam!) and it’s right in the centre of Pest.
We were only there for one night, but we had a good time.
After getting into our room, we did what any normal people would do:
Have a shower and then a nap.
(Not together obviously, that would be weird lol).
After waking up, it was pretty late.
Like I said, neither of us slept well the night before and needed to recover.
Once we woke up, it was time to go for a wander.
My dad struggled to get into his trainers as his foot was as swollen as Arnold Schwarzenegger’s biceps. But once they were in, we were ready to go.
The first point of call was to find the place where my dad would be attending his business conference.
While he’d be spending most of his days in Budapest there, I’d be free to check out the Hungarian capital solo.
After swerving in and out of meandering side-streets, we were able to find the conference hall with little difficulty.
Weirdly, it was located right in the middle of Pest’s party district.
Surrounding the conference venue were plenty of pubs, bars and nightclubs which were teeming with tourists and locals all day and all night.
Luckily for us, we were also able to find an incredible Hungarian restaurant with a live pianist.
My dad instantly fell in love with the piano player and couldn’t stop applauding his every move.
I honestly think he loved the music more than the food, which is saying something because the food was outstanding.
I had a Goulash soup followed by a Goulash dish.
The result?
Love.
I officially love Hungarian food.
It’s incredible.
While I was busy guzzling down the wonderful meal that was in front of me, my dad was staring starry eyed at the pianist as he played love songs with his elegant fingers.
At one point, my dad got so into it that he began singing at the top of his lungs and began drawing confused looks from everyone in the restaurant.
My cheeks flushed red in embarassment as I pleaded for him to stop, but he wouldn’t listen:
“WEEEE ARE THE CHAMPIONS, MY FRIENDS…..
AND WEEEE’LL, KEEP ON FIIIGHTING TILL THE END…”
Safe to say we both had a great time on our first night in Budapest.
Tomorrow would be even better…
If you liked this little story, stay tuned for the next ones.
I’m going to be sharing everything I did and all the things I was feeling on my travels.
Thanks for reading,
Godfrey

Budapest, like other capital cities, have interesting memorials and statues that turn heads and force conversation. And there are plenty of them too; afterall, the largest statue park in Europe is also here, measuring a huge 56 hectares (Kerepesi Cemetery).
Memento Park is also just outside the city, and born from a difficult past. After the lifting of the Iron Curtain, Hungarians uprooted and dumped almost every statue placed during the communist period. Out of the city; out of the mind. The following are a list of the most interesting statues in Budapest.
Belgrád rkp., 1056
A lovely stroll down the Pest-side of the Danube pedestrian zone will bring you to these two wholesome figures. It’s a spitting distance to the ‘little princess’, and a beautiful place to photograph and take in the views of the Buda side. Look out for The Marriott Hotel.
Actually, not much is known about these statues, except that the Sculptor Raffay Dávid had known he wanted to be a sculptor from an early age — three years old!
Széchenyi Lánchíd, 1051
When I first arrived in Budapest, I was told the Myth about the Lions on the four corners of the Széchenyi Bridge. It goes a little something like this.
In 1852, sculptor János Marschalkó unveiled his stone work to be used on the recently opened Széchenyi Bridge. He was so proud of his work that he announced he would throw himself off the bridge if any faults were found. The story goes on to say that a girl spoke up that the lions had no tongues. He threw himself off the bridge out of embarrassment.
Whether he did or not, it’s a story full of passion, big-headedness, and a pinch of comedy (OK, tragedy). János Marschalkó lived well into the 1870’s, and for good reason — the lions HAVE tongues, they just can’t be seen from a low perspective.
NB — This made me think of The National Library in Sarajevo — Check it out!
Corvin sétány 1, 1082
I’m sure you know Bud Spencer — an actor, famous for adventure comedies, crime escapades and spaghetti westerns. This rootin’, tootin’ and gun-shootin’ Italian, originally from Naples, starred in over 50 films, a handful of TV and even a video game. Although Budapest is well known for filmmaking, Bud Spencer never came to Budapest, neither filmed any scenes here. So why the statue?
Bud Spencer didn’t receive the attention he did until he teamed up with Terence Hill in the late 60’s. Together, they created simple yet action packed films that everyone around the world could enjoy. Hungarians, during the communist occupation, fell in love with the entertainment he brought with each new film. They were the popular stars from a foreign country — an attractive one from outside the communist reach. Although they appeared dubbed, the story lines were easy enough to follow without needing to know the language.
The huge bronze statue weighs in at half a ton, and was placed there a year after his death in 2016 by sculptor Szandra Tasnádi as a beautiful sign of respect. It is the first one of its kind, and at the unveiling was Cristiana Pedersoli (daughter) and Olympic water polo player György Kárpáti (friend). The inscription “We never fought” were the words Terrence Hill used to describe Bud at his funeral.
Zrínyi u., 1051
One of the most visited and famous statues in Budapest is the fat policeman — you can tell by his shiny belly. His location couldn’t get any better as he gets to stare at the St. Stephan's Basilica all day. Tourists can’t help but get a snap of themselves with him.
The fat policeman statue in central Budapest was sculptured by Illyés András in 2008, and can be found on the corner of Zrínyi and Október 6. Street. The sculpture itself was based on the characteristics of peoples faces dwelling in the city, with the portly physique taken from the sculptors grandfather.
Práter u. 11, 1082
This collection of statues portrays a group of boys playing marbles outside an old brick school building. It is a depiction of a scene early on in the book Pál utcai fiúk — the Paul Street Boys.
You’ll find this gem just round the corner from Corvin Shopping Plaza.
This book by Hungarian author Ferenc Molnár tells the story of two gangs of children fighting over rundown territory. The book became hugely popular and turned into a famous Hungarian classic, still taught in primary school.
NB — If you like this story, the National Museum in Budapest has created a marble run and area in honour of the Pal Street Boys — perfect for young kids!
Walking Tour Idea — If you're looking for a street map of these statues, check out our link here.
Falk Miksa u., 1055
Columbo is one of Hungary’s most admired characters — it might have something to do with Peter Falk’s Hungarian heritage. His mother, a Jewish Hungarian emigrated to the States before he was born.
His statue shows his typical thinking posture with cigar in hand, while his basset hound dog named ‘dog’ stares at him patiently. Funnily enough, the statue was placed opposite the National Comedy Theatre, and visible from Jászai Mari square.
Dob u. 12, 1072
Carl Lutz was the Budapest based Swiss Vice-Consul from 1942 until 1945 — the end of World War II. As a designer and leader of the largest most successful rescue operation, he was instrumental in saving more than 62,000 Hungarian Jews. In fact, Budapest is the only capital in Eastern Europe where enough Hungarian Jews survived to continue their community — over 100,000.
You’ll find these statues one block away from the Dohány Street Synagogue’s Tree Of Life. The inscription reads: In the building at Szabadság tér 12, Swiss Vice Consul Carl Lutz honorably represented the interests of the United States of America and other countries between 1942 and 1945. He courageously saved the lives of tens of thousands of Hungarian citizens persecuted as Jews.
Belgrád rkp., 1051
The Little Princess statue is one of the most famous sculptures in Budapest because of its perfect location. This statuette sits on the railings next to the pedestrian area on the Pest side of the Danube and scenic Tram 2. Expect great views and a perfect place for photographs.
The artist, László Marton created this in 1972, taking his eldest daughter as inspiration. Apparently, she would wear his dressing gown and parade around as a princess. This statue is so loved that copies have sprung up in the Hungarian town of Tapolca and in front of the concert hall of the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Space in Japan.
Szabadság tér 16, 1054
Ronald Reagan is a little strange as a statue in Budapest, let alone in the very important Freedom Square (Szabadság tér). It feels out of place until you realise it was created to honour Reagan and his efforts in ending the cold war. The end of the cold war would end the Soviet occupation of Hungary.
The positioning is perfect — not only is he walking toward the American Embassy, he is also staring at the monument dedicated to the Soviet liberation of Hungary in World War II from Nazi German occupation.
Vajdahunyad stny, City Park, 1146
One of the most fascinating statues in Budapest is the one known as ‘Anonymous’, and definitely one of my favourites. The hooded man is sitting in a relaxed pose, holding a pen. An inscription starts with a capital ‘P’, and continues with “dictus magister ac quondam bone memorie gloriosissimi Bele regis Hungarie notarius” (and Bela the master of the king of Hungary was struck by the notary who were once of the most glorious of good memory). The ‘P’ is likely his name, or an abbrev. of praedictus, meaning ‘aforementioned’.
The anonymous statue of Budapest was the notary of the Hungarian king Béla III, and famous for his work Gesta Hungarorum (“The Deeds of the Hungarians”) over 800 years ago. It’s the most detailed account of the Hungarians’ arrival to the Carpathian basin. Being a very important writer, people make their way to the inner court area of the Vajdahunyad Castle to touch his pen, and receive special, ungodly writing powers. Worth a try.
These statues of peoples shoes on the Danube river bank hold on to one of the haunting and saddest situations in Hungary’s history. These 60 pairs of shoes are a memory to those who were killed by Arrow Cross Party in 1944–45. Let’s back up a little.
When Germany waged war through Europe, it was only a matter of time before their attention came to Hungary. The government was overthrown in October 1944, Ferenc Szalasi was the puppet that took the job. His fascist and antisemitic ideas were poured into the Arrow Cross Party, who beat and killed Jewish citizens of the city.
As shoes were valuable, the victims were made to remove their shoes before being executed and left to fall into the cold, strong current of the Danube. Almost 100,000 Jews vanished. 80,000 Jews left the country by force, and the other 20,000 were shot along the river banks. These life-sized shoes with amazing detail were installed in 2005 by Can Togay (Director; The Summer Guest) and Gyula Pauer (Sculptor).

A lot of Hungarian soldiers and civilians died during World War I and their loved ones went numb. Their fathers, brothers, husbands and sons were somewhere away from home, either mixed in soil or were feeding themselves to birds. Until then Budapest was more attractive than a magnet to tourists from every part of the world. The post-war effects and an approach of the new war engulfed Budapest.
Budapest was now in the arms of mass suicides, which arose from the day of losing their loved ones. Budapest became “The city of Suicides”. Will you believe me if I say all these happened because of a popular song “Gloomy Sunday”, which was printed in Sunday Times? It was also called ‘the suicide song’ and ‘the killer song’. It was written in a hundred languages around the world and has claimed to have killed hundreds of people.
All the people who drowned in the deep waters of Danube River had left behind the newspaper cutting of Sunday Times, which had the lyrics of the song. It was composed by Rezső Seress and published in 1933. Here are the lines.
“Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?
Gloomy Sunday
Death is no dream,
For in death I’m caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I’ll be blessing you
Gloomy Sunday”
The song somehow gave hope to all the people who wanted to reunite with their loved ones.
In 1937, ‘The Sunday Times’ wrote an article on the “ City of Suicides”. It’s funny how the newspaper criticises and asks to ban the song and the lyricist for suicides. When it was The Sunday Times, who propagated and shared those lines throughout Budapest in the first place. The song was then banned on radios.
The politicians, social activists, common people were searching for a solution. To bring out people from their sad lives. And now professor Jeno and hypnotist Binczo brought out the“Smile School”. This was to counteract the unending love for suicides.
People of Budapest had already forgotten how to smile. Not even a four-year-old smiled. The Smile School was introducing them to a different world. At first people were made to wear a smiling mask. Teaching them, how to smile by hiding their feelings inside. They thought that teaching the people how to smile would make them happier. And finally forget the pain!
Then they started teaching different styles of smile, the Roosevelt smile, the Mona Lisa smile, the Dick Powell smile, the Loretta smile, and a lot more. They could choose the smile of any celebrity they loved and the fees was depending on the type of smile they want to master. They claimed to charge up to $500 for teaching the Roosevelt smile in six weeks. Roosevelt had the best smile!
The Mona Lisa smile is more difficult but cheaper. They were asked to do the smiles they were learning five times a day, using a mirror. Founder of Smile School, hypnotist Jeno said says the best business is enabling pupils to achieve the talent of smiling naturally.
Thousands of people around Budapest joined the Smile Schools desperately to learn how to smile! All around the world, where Budapest was once called the “ City of Suicides” a new name came up, “The City of Smiles.” However there was no reduction in suicides, the change was only in the name!
There were still people dying around with the song “ Gloomy Sunday” near the banks of Danube.
By then the whole Smile School was proved to be a hoax by Het Leven.
BUDAPEST, “CITY OF SUICIDES,” IS TAUGHT TO FORCE A SMILE
A joker in Budapest, Hungary lately evolved the “smile school” The idea was made in purpose to counteract the bad publicity Budapest has gotten from the number of suicides supposedly inspired by the Budapest song, Gloomy Sunday. The suicide rate in Budapest is actually very high, even now.
The Smile School was then shut down, with the beginning of World War II. But this simple odd idea of teaching people smile led to the evolution of Laughter brigades and Laughter clubs around the world!
Love,
Dona

I wasn’t ready for Budapest.
In 2004, T, my sister, brother-in-law, and I found super cheap flights to Budapest and decided to travel there on a whim. Being that it was 2004, Budapest wasn’t on many travelers’ radars like it is now.
Of course we expected it to be beautiful, much like many of the other European cities we had previously visited. But we had no idea just how majestic and spellbinding Budapest truly is. A magical merge of striking allure, historical grandeur, and cutting-edge grittiness that had us enamored right from the start.
There are so many things to love about Budapest, but here’s a good start: it’s brimming with stunning architecture, amazing thermal baths, breathtaking views, and a distinguished culture.
Still not convinced? It’s extraordinarily affordable, especially when compared to many other European cities.
Below are the top ten things to do in beautiful Budapest.
One of the most iconic landmarks in all of Hungary, the Parliament Building is a spectacular example of exquisite Neo-Gothic architecture. This masterpiece of a building is a popular tourist attraction, equally due to its magnificent splendor and idyllic location along the meandering Danube River. It’s worth walking around the back as well to get the full scale of its grandness, as well as the sheer beauty of the structure.
Hailing as the second longest river in all of Europe, it’s pretty much impossible to miss this imposing Danube River. Riverside strolls and sails are not only a must here, they’re pretty much inevitable. The Danube River is the beating pulse of Budapest, coursing its way through the expansive city.
Fun fact: The capital city of Budapest was the result of the unification of separate towns of Buda and Pest in 1873.
One of the many things we loved about Budapest is its walkability, and perhaps nowhere within the city encourages individuals to explore it by foot than the Szechnyi Chain Bridge.The pedestrian-friendly bridge offers fantastic views of both Buda and Pest and is one of the main bridges in Budapest that links the majority of sites.
Perched upon Castle Hill, Fisherman’s Bastion is a remarkable spot to enjoy panoramic views of the river and Pest beyond it. Its historical charm and opulence outweigh the fellow tourists that will inevitable accompany your visit. Think striking towers, spilling-over terraces, and attractive cobbled streets. A lovely spot to soak up Budapest’s radiance.
This luxurious historical castle and royal palace complex pays homage to the Hungarian kings. As the most prominent building of Castle Hill, it dominates the hill and provides beyond impressive views of the city and river. While it’s worth visiting at any time of the day, nightfall is particularly special when it’s dramatically illuminated.
Thing to know: Riding the funicular is a relatively cheap and scenic way to reach the Buda Castle hill. Click here for rates and hours of operation.
Promise me this: you will not leave Budapest without visiting at least one of its delightful spas and soaking in its thermal baths. One of the highlights of our trip was spending an afternoon at Gellert Spa and Bath. Dating back to 1918, Gellert Baths is one of the city’s oldest and most famous bathhouses.
The building’s interior is ornate and lavish, with a number of various wellness treatments offered. My sister and I opted for a massage and soak in the heated pools. Note that the establishment does get busy, so you may want to go on the earlier (or later) side in hopes of avoiding large crowds. We visited later in the day and found the spa and pools to be pretty quiet. Remember to pack your swimwear and some thick skin-the Hungarian masseuses are known to be very strong and firm (I can definitely attest to this!).
It should be no surprise that Hungarian food is HEAVY. Stick-to-your-ribs heavy. But also, pretty damn delicious. Depending on what time of year you travel to Hungary, your level of appreciation for its gluttonous heavy ways may vary. It was cold during our travels, and our bellies and souls craved as much warming comfort food as we could possibly get. So you might say that we welcomed all of its savory goulashes, stews, and soups with open hearts and eager tastebuds.
Hungarian cuisine is the epitome of comfort food, and we wouldn’t have wanted it any other way.
Hands down the best meal of the trip was at Gundel, a formal restaurant that serves delicious gourmet Hungarian fare.
There is no shortage of grand and historical coffeehouses in Budapest. If you need to seek some solace from the cold, you are in for a real treat-we absolutely loved the cafe scene here. The most charming and delightful of all of the cafes that we visited was Gerbaud, an elegant cafe that’s worthy of the hype (and elevated prices).
The coffee, pastries, and desserts were decadently divine. We absolutely loved it here.
As mentioned previously, Budapest is a gloriously walkable city, with an efficient and reliable metro system to boot, making it a very easy city to explore. Take the time to meander and marvel at the unique architecture, iconic sites, and distinctive neighborhoods.
Heroes’ Square St. Stephen’s Basilica
Okay, so technically not in Budapest, but beautiful and lovely nonetheless, is Szentendre, an enchanting and picturesque Hungarian town alongside the Danube. A short and simple forty-five minute train ride delivers you directly to the quaint little village of a town, characterized by baroque architecture, historical churches, colorful houses and narrow, cobbled streets.
The charming main square and alleyways are lined with museum and art galleries, adorable shops and boutiques, and cozy restaurants and cafes.
We were captivated by Szentendre’s beauty and quietness. An absolutely delightful day trip from Budapest!
Four full days gave us a great introduction to the amazingness of Budapest. With its more recent rise in popularity, I’d love to return one day, especially to see how much the city has changed. Wishing you the happiest of travels to beautiful Budapest and beyond!

Budapest has become one of the top tourist destinations in Europe, for a good reason. Often, we do not recognize the beauty of the place that we live in anymore. But Budapest is simply amazing, and there is no reason to argue about it. It is not a city to tick in one or two days. Here you can easily spend a week discovering something new. But as in every place, being a tourist or live and work somewhere are two different things. Read till the end of this article if you want to know more about the complex image and the less charming sides of Budapest as well.
After having been to several corners of Europe, I can say that Budapest is the most picturesque city at night when it is enveloped in lights. No, it is not Paris. Budapest is the city divided by the river Danube into two parts, Buda as Pest. Hence the name Budapest.
I can be bored of seeing Jungfrau in Switzerland, the picturesque villages of Austria, or the countless churches of Italy. Still, I cannot cross the river Danube without throwing an eye on the ensemble of stunning monuments (The Buda castle, The Fisherman’s Bastion, The Chain Bridge, the…

Today, coffee is more than just a drink; it’s a necessary component of the traditional morning ritual. Coffee plays an essential role in daily life, whether you stumble out of bed and head straight for the cafetière or impatiently wait in line, hoping the barista rushes to serve you a flat white so you can get to work on time. Coffee has become a cultural phenomenon embedded in societies worldwide, but the journey of coffee stretches far beyond the early-morning hustle of today’s world. In Budapest, coffee is one of the many threads of the city’s rich tapestry. This documentary, Budapest’s Coffee Obsession, takes audiences on a historical exploration of rich brewing techniques through the travels of coffee lover Lyrkan Thuery. This paper will begin by conducting a brief textual analysis of two screen productions: Rise of Empires: Ottomans (2020) and The Story Of Coffee (2016). The analysis of the two…

A travel essay about Budapest and London, written in Copenhagen, Frankfurt, and Zagreb. I think I need to grow some roots.
Onwards!👇
When I’d come back from London, last year, I was flooded with splendor and grandiosity, yes, but was also sticky with the smell of a city that was once a heart of an empire but isn’t quite any longer. This smell emanated from every statue, monument, and stolid building. It oozed from the English gardens, swelled and dissipated with the Thames, fluttered on the rooftops like drunken pigeons. Even the somber tolling of the Big Ben carried with it an obvious verdict — an end to an era. London is well on its way to becoming just another capital city, albeit with a few more trinkets to auction, and a rather nasty sting in the form of the Trident nuclear missiles.
Coming back from Budapest I am flooded with a similar feeling, although it is far more nuanced and light. Hungary was once a rather significant European power (at least until the arrival of Ottomans and the collapse of so much European hubris). It extended all the way to Dalmatia and Slavonia in Croatia, something that is still touted by the old coat of arms scattered throughout the city — on the faces of buildings, forts, and magnificent bridges.
The city itself is monumental and even monolithic. It boasts elaborate facades studded with gargoyles, satires, and that European animal rarer than the unicorn, leprechaun, and Baba Yaga together. I am talking, of course, about the common African lion which the Europeans have elevated above every other animal of much greater use, economy, and industry. The lion can roar, yes, but is otherwise rather lazy and disinterested in the plight of both lionkind and mankind. Which, come to think of it, does a decent job of summarizing royalty worldwide.
Fine then, let the lion stand.
Walking through the streets of Budapest one eventually emerges onto the Hero Square, or the Hungarian Parliament Building, or Istvan Basilica. These buildings, along with many others, impart one of the most salient impressions of the city.
Nothing is small.
The streets are long, straight, and immensely wide, even the side streets. There are no London back alleys in Budapest. Buildings don’t come in sizes smaller than big. Some, like the Hungarian Parliament Building or the Széchenyi Medicinal Bath, are so large that it is easy to feel lost while walking their perimeter, let alone wandering their innards. Then there’s the Buda Castle on the Castle Hill, Hungarian National Library, St. Stephen’s Basilica, and a myriad of edifices that all carry with them a particularly Hungarian flavor — the beauty of Budapest architecture is incredible, improbable even, and unapologetically big.
The city has, since the 20s, been called the City of Baths, owing to the many thermal springs that soak its foundation — there are at least 6 in Budapest proper, and over a thousand in the whole of Hungary. The country essentially consists of boiling water, a few layers of dirt, and a city thrown on top, here and there.
We soaked our bodies in the Szechenyi Baths along with a thousand other people, of all colors, from every corner of the world, even those that now mostly supply the nameless people on the Hungarian fenced borders, trusting in the healing properties of thermal springs that contained sulfites and smelled the part.
The Bath itself is enormous, covering more than 6000 square meters, and boasting both indoor and outdoor thermal pools of varying temperatures. The largest outdoor pool is a special experience, particularly in the winter, with 36-degree water in 2-degree weather. Needless to say, the scalp gets a little chilly. There I also noticed a pandemic of a disease whose symptoms terrorize attention, ruin sleep, and cause a strange craning of the neck. I’m talking, of course, of the infernal smartphone whose allure seems so immense that the bathers couldn’t seem to bear parting with them, even in the pool. This forced them to hold one hand outside the water in the cold air, somewhat like the hand waving of English royalty, that is to say, dumb and unnecessary.
Since my smartphone habits are less than exemplary, I write this with slight rudeness to my cheek.
The city is nestled in a valley of hills and offers both flat grounds to cycle on and slopes to climb. In Budapest, unlike Copenhagen where I live, one has a use for the Achilles heel.
On one of the days we set out to explore the Grand Market but by the time we managed to saunter toward it, it had closed, leaving us only with a sight of its iridescent roof tiles. These tiles, called the Zsolnay tiles, are one of the most memorable sights in Budapest if you’re into that kind of a thing, which you are probably not. Neither am I, but these tiles still persist in my memory for reasons that remain unaccounted for.
With the closed doors of the Grand Market behind us, we set off across the magnificent Szabadság Bridge that joins its brethren in spanning the wide, mighty, and lazy Danube River. Even though it flows through Croatia, I’d never seen the Danube before and it was a curious feeling to know that, only a three hour drive downstream, my father had grown up in the town of Borovo, fishing and splashing his way through a childhood so far removed from mine that it sometimes seems almost fantastical.
On the other side of the river stands yet another monumental building. This time it’s the Gellért Thermal Bath whose pools gaped empty that day like the hands of a beggar who once knew splendor.
The Gellért Baths squat in the shadow of Gellért Hill, which was named after Saint Gerard who was allegedly thrown down its slopes to meet a gruesome death. The crown jewel of the hilL is the Liberty Statue, erected by the Soviets as a token to themselves for the liberation of Hungary at the end of WWII. The inscription on the bottom originally read:
“To the memory of the liberating Soviet heroes erected by the grateful Hungarian people in 1945.”
After the overthrow of communism in Europe, the inscription was later changed to:
“To the memory of those all who sacrificed their lives for the independence, freedom, and prosperity of Hungary.”
I found it an interesting example of how history, once decided upon, can certainly be changed, and changed again if need be.
Be that as it may, hundreds of people milled about the Liberty Statue under an angry, frozen Sun — some examining the high walls above, some examining the city below, but most, as you can imagine, examining the smartphone in their hands.
Of our own conduct I will not say much, except that we’d opted to breathe in the hazy vista that blankets the horizon, entwining people, nature, and the city of Budapest into a memory of a few short days touched by the long thoughts of history.
Thank you for reading.

This is the story of one of the least appealing things I have ever eaten. And also, of friendship. But mostly it’s about the unappealing thing. Read at your own risk.
…
You’re still here? Alright… let’s do this.
The November rain in Budapest seems to stick in the air like an impenetrable damp fog. The buildings are grandiose but muted, the people walk with their heads down, not in a hurry, but simply uninterested in their surroundings. I’ve traveled here with Garrett, a dry humored Canadian who has just come aboard the kitchen at my job in Sweden. With a week off of work, we agree to try a short trip together.
We are on the edge of town, searching for a local’s restaurant that one of us saw on some travel TV program. We’ve ridden away from the water that cuts between Buda and Pest, past the ornate museums and old sandstone buildings, and beyond the golden roofs. We are in a residential neighborhood now, drab Eastern European blocks houses, Soviet in look and feel; the sky here seems even more grey than before, the colors of the painted buildings seem a touch more muted.
We find Pléhcsárda hidden behind another small shack of a restaurant. The whole operation looks like a trailer set up in a trailer park. The dining room is a single table set up in front of the ordering window, which looks like it was made of…

Back on the rails, listening to stories and walking the ragged end of Budapest’s nineth district. To reach a nearby built-up area rather than retrace my steps through a wasteland with the occasional industrial complex I had spent the morning exploring on foot, I must cross six railway tracks with no formal crossing point. I watch a woman navigate the rails from the other side of the tracks and ask her advice about gaps in the fence there between road and rail before stepping out. With some trepidation. It is just three months since I fell down a railway embankment outside of Sofia in Bulgaria breaking my ankle and putting my Belt-Road tour from Beijing to Europe on hold as I limped back to London on crutches.
In contrast to earlier sections of the Belt-Road’s Middle Passage, many rail tracks connect Sofia, the first stop in Europe with the rest of the continent. I settle on the route through Bucharest in Romania, skirting around Belgrade in Serbia where, as in Bucharest, stories of Chinese investments suggest built, financial and social landscapes reformatted. Leaving the ground for a moment and taking a more abstract view from above, these stories boil down to minimising regulations, short-circuiting tendering processes, riding rough shod over environmental regulations, confiscating land and poor compensation: all in the rush to begin construction. Beneath these stories are cash-strapped local economies, anxious politicians and local elites eager for Chinese finance and the profits they bring while local citizens pay off the loans through their taxes and watch the disappearance of public land. Budapest fits this description too. China’s direct investment in Hungary (2023) is more than US$8 billion, by far Europe’s biggest share.
Back on the ground, the wasteland I spent the morning exploring on the ragged edge of Budapest’s nineth district is the site of China’s first university in Europe; Fudan Hungary University announced to great fanfare by both governments in 2021. I walk towards it across three and four line highways, elevated routeways made for traffic not walking and dotted with corporate offices. The BYD offices sit here along with a string of high-end car dealerships and the ‘Dream Store’ that sells bathroom fittings. BYD — which stands for Build Your Dreams — is the Chinese electric car and world-leading battery manufacturer hedging its bets on sanctions against China by setting up factories inside the EU. So far it’s Hungarian operations only makes batteries, but car factories are planned and reported to be in construction in other parts of the country.
I walk past construction sites confirming the feeling that this is one of the city’s edges, a place where Budapest is still being built. One of these has blue shipping containers stacked and creatively repurposed as housing and bathrooms for construction workers. I wander around marvelling at the use of surplus Chinese containers — trade between the two countries is asymmetrical — until a man in a high vis jacket throws me out. Next I pass the stylish white tubular athletics stadium on the edge of the area where the university is supposed to be. I can see no university, no ground being prepared, no suggestion of construction, only a large tract of scrub land in autumnal browns and yellows and an impressive derelict building that is gently falling down in the distance.
Walking further I find the exact place where the university might be but isn’t. I only know this from the street names — Dali Lama, Uyghur Martyrs, Free Hong Kong and Bishop Xi Shinguang of China’s underground Catholic Church. Krisztiana Baranyi, mayor of the nineth district, renamed the streets on which the new university would sit so as to annoy the Chinese Government and discourage the university’s construction. Popular protests erupted in 2021. Building didn’t start then and the scheme didn’t deliver a completed campus by 2024 as reports claimed it would. Optimistic news reports and announcements from both the Chinese and the Hungarian side insist that there would be five to six thousand students enrolled in shiny new buildings and five hundred staff at this outpost of China’s top tier university system by 2024. Instead there is no university; only a piece of wasteland waiting for something to happen.
Local citizens protesting the scheme object to the appropriation of city land for the education of elite students. The Budapest branch of Shanghai’s top tier university intended to charge the sort of fees most Hungarian students couldn’t afford, making it a resource only for the wealthiest. City plans earlier earmarked this area as a ‘student city’ intending it to be used to build low cost rental accommodation for students and young academics. The estimated costs of building Fudan in Budapest is in the region of E1.5 billion — more than Hungary’s Higher Education operating budget for 2019 — to be financed by a loan from China repaid by Hungarian tax payers. A Chinese contractor mired in scandal — China State Construction Engineering Corporation — would build the university using Chinese labour and materials making it hard to see the benefit for local people. Perhaps most controversially of all, delivery of this project is the responsibility of a Board of Trustees, headed by the Minister of Culture. Although there is no university and no project to manage, the Board of Trustees is paid E1.5 million a year — to date E16 million — for maintenance and operating costs on non-existent buildings despite not even having an office nor producing any activity reports (Daily News Hungary 13 August 2023).
A source close to the mayor told me that the university project hasn’t gone away, but as the Hungarian Government runs out of money it has stopped or slowed a number of expensive Chinese investment projects including the Fudan campus. Another story was offered by a taxi driver taking me to Budapest Keleti station for my train to Germany and the last stop on my Belt-Road tour. He understood that the mayor had secured permission for the athletics stadium to be built in the nineth district if the university proposal was dropped. He says that while the university project isn’t a secret, ‘no one talks about it’, although Fudan University and other Chinese projects indicate radically different directions in Budapest’s future.
Bigger stories run along these rails through Hungary too. Orbán’s Fidesz Party is desperate to attract Chinese finance, even now signing deals for factories, security systems to ‘combat terrorism’ and new railway connections to Belgrade and Budapest airport. Media reports show that Orbán’s closest local allies if not Orbán himself benefit from Chinese contracts. But the biggest story of all is geopolitical. Among many rosy statements about Chinese-Hungarian cooperation and solidarity, Xi Jinping loudly proclaims that Hungary is in China’s inner ‘circle of friends’. By this he means those countries that do the most to support China’s efforts to counter US power and influence in the world. Hungary’s rail tracks are the front line in tilting the axis of global power in China’s direction: offer a new vision for how the world might work (Financial Times 11 May 2024). This makes the rails that run through Budapest and its non-existent university a very big deal indeed.

I visited Budapest in 1990 very soon after the fall of the Iron Curtain, when the first glimmers of open gay life were just starting to show — nervous glimmers indeed compared to the astounding turnout of an estimated 200,000 people at the LGBTQ+ Pride march in the Hungarian capital on the 28th June 2025, the march expanding from a previous peak of 35,000 people as people came together in defiance of a ban put on the assembly by the Prime Minister, Viktor Orban.
In 1990 the gays in Budapest were not visible. There was a bar or two in the fashionable city centre where Spartacus, the gay guide to the world that every gay traveler kept in their backpack in those days, said gays were welcome. They were in no way gay bars — and the only club in town was in a discrete backstreet location some distance from the centre, had no signage to indicate its presence — but once inside I found a fledgling gay scene taking its first, nervous, steps. People were shy and guarded, but the music was good and we danced. I remember meeting a Russian ballet dancer. That was it. Gays were definitely not in the news. The big story in Budapest at the time was the opening of their first MacDonalds.
28th June this year was the 56th anniversary of the start of the Stonewall Riots in New York, the moment that is regarded as the kicking off point for the Gay Pride movement that emerged in the 1970s. As a direct consequence of the Hungarian government’s vindictive attack on the LGBTQ+ community, the world now sees how far the Hungarian people have come in accepting their queer brothers, sisters and children — this anniversary year may stand out in history as something like Hungary’s own Stonewall moment.
But no riot in Budapest. Despite threats to use facial recognition software and fine attendees, in the end the government directed the police to not harass participants and although they also gave permission to right wing groups to stage counter protests, nothing of any significance emerged from that. Instead a massive parade celebrating love in all its forms with attendees from 40 countries, stretched through the city. The photos and videos are incredible.
The beauty, harmony, love, peacefulness and joy on display revealed how utterly phobic and toxic the homophobic attitude of the ruling party is. The official ban was justified on the grounds of Pride being a danger to children — which simply reveals the dark minds of those proposing the ban, who are actually projecting their own dark thoughts onto gay people when they see us as sexual deviants and predators. Pride is not about sex, it’s about freedom — and knowing that, many heterosexuals walked in the march too.
Hungary is not the only eastern European country in which right wing politicians are stoking public debate about gay and trans people to fire up their base and to distract from anti-democratic legislation which they are pushing through their parliaments. It’s happening in Slovenia too. And some might say there’s signs of the same in the UK.
Pride is a Freedom March.
A Protest. A Declaration of Power.
Pride is Love In Action.

Budapest was such an awesome city! Although not at the very top, it comes a very close second! It is very open and spread out, yet it still had its nooks and crannies to get lost in. The city reminded us of Brooklyn in NY, it had a trendy/hipster feel with a lot of young people. The nightlife was outrageous, with tons of restaurants to eat at and bars to socialize in, for all sorts of tastes. There were parks to lay around in or many shopping streets to keep you busy. There is something for everyone in Budapest… except a beach which is why Barcelona is still our favorite city visited so far.
Budapest has 23 districts and they are usually indicated by Roman numerals. The more central districts, like downtown, have lower numbers while the outer districts have higher numbers. The best districts to stay in are district V and VI as within these 2 districts you can find a lot of the major landmarks & attractions, along with the widest selection of restaurants, cafes, pubs and bars. Most, if not all, are walkable. We barely used the Metro system but it was very easy to navigate when necessary.
There were countless accommodation options in Budapest especially a huge range of hostels. Booking the day before still allowed us over 40+ hostels to choose from. We ended up staying at 11th Hour Hostel and Cinema which was located right in the middle of downtown. Some other popular hostels in a great location are Wombats, Big Fish, Downtown Oasis, Maverick City Lodge.
Szechenyi Baths and Pool — One of the largest spa complexes of its kind in Europe. The entry ticket is (5000 HUF/ 16 €) which includes the usage of a change room, locker, multiple different pools, saunas, steam rooms and fitness centre. We spent a couple of hours here relaxing in the pools & sweating it up in the saunas. Note: bring your own towel & lunch as there isn’t a large selection of food!
Conquer Budapest Walking tour visiting St Stephen Basilica, Matthias Church, Danube Promenade, Chain Bridge, National Opera House, Castle District (Royal Palace, Matthias Church, Fisherman Bastion). Our guide for this was one of our favourites of our Europe trip so far and we’ve done a lot of ‘free walking tours’. The tour was never boring even though we are slowly but surely getting tired of churches and history, he kept it interesting and fun for the whole 3 hours. The Fisherman Bastion is shown below.
Central Market Hall- A 3 story hall combing shopping and eating. Fresh fruit and vegetable stalls, meats, cheeses, souvenirs, shopping and most importantly a selection of food stalls with portions bigger than you can ever imagine. Classic Hungarian dishes are sold here but come hungry and forget trying to count calories.
Vaci Utca — Vaci Utca is one of the main shopping streets in Budapest and also a very popular tourist drag. The street is lined with cute cafes, great shops and a tonne of Thai massage parlours which we indulged in (do shop around).
Margaret Island — A 2.5km long central island laying in between “buda” and “pest”. A very well kept island with ample to do during the summer months. It’s a beautiful spot to spend an afternoon during the spring/summer. The island has a pool, water park, wildlife park & athletic centre. We strolled here from downtown Budapest or you can take the number 26 bus which is the only vehicle allowed on the island.
Gellert Hill — Panoramic views over Budapest. You can climb the Gellért Hill starting at the Elisabeth Bridge near the Gellért Monument, or you can take the steeper route starting at the Gellért Hotel. You can also take a bus or get there by taxi.
Eating in Budapest was a welcomed treat after indulging in so much pasta and pizza in Italy. Hungary had their typical cuisine but also every other type, so there was never too much repeating. It was cheap, the portions were often of a good size and there were countless restaurants to choose from.
Street food is also very common and convenient in Budapest. At Karavan you can find numerous food trucks in this little outdoor area. Perfect for a quick dinner or a late night snack after spending time at the famous ruin bar, Szimpla Kert.
Below is a list of the typical Hungarian dishes you should try if you are to visit the city! And before you finish, don’t be alarmed when we mention that we did eat all of them.. a few times.
You can easily sample all of these on your own throughout the city but if you enjoy food tours then we suggest signing up for one of the many tours Taste Hungary has to offer.
Hungarians typically eat their biggest meal during lunch so many restaurants offer a “Tourist Menu” which involves a three-course meal for less than $6 (100 HUF), this is often cheaper than ordering just one dish. However, when we weren’t eating a 3-course meal, you could find us at some of our other favourite restaurants:
Bors Gasztrobar — Always a line, freshly made baguette sandwiches, homemade soups & cheap cheap!Drum Cafe — Cheap, classic Hungarian food.Fruccola — Healthy, fresh, create your own salads/sandwiches.Magyar — Classic 3 course restaurant with generous portions. Close to the Grand Central Market but surprisingly not a tourist trap as we had first thought.
Just like restaurants, the nightlife options are endless and generally are within walking distance. We weren’t in Budapest over the weekend but each night had something going on.
Some of you may be aware of what a “Ruin Bar” is, some not… well Budapest is famous for these types of bars. It is simply a bar/pub, inside or next to an old building. The buildings have usually been abandoned and turned into bars by decorating them with many different types of objects, such as paper statues, foreign licence plates, unique lanterns and seats made from cushions, old cars, duck tape, you name it. If you use your imagination you can usually get a picture for what they look like. None of the interior makes sense and generally doesn’t have a theme except looking like ‘designed junk’. If the walls aren’t covered with pictures and objects then they are painted.
Some of the most popular Ruin bars in Budapest are Szimpla Kert, Grandio, Instant, Yellow Zebra Bikes & Bar and Anker’T. If you have to go to only one, make it Szimpla Kert! So much fun and so unique. It’s open during the day, so you can get a better look at the interior. Grandio is a hostel as well as a bar so don’t stay here if you’re wanting to sleep!
Gozsdu Courtyard is another popular area in downtown. Although they aren’t ruin bars, the courtyard/long street has a variety of beer gardens and restaurants and is both popular with locals and tourists. Check out Spiler, one of the biggest restaurants in the area with a solid menu both for food and drinks. The lamb burger was super tasty & recommended.
We were really sad to leave Budapest but until next time…..

A Peek Inside The House of Terror — One of Budapest’s Most Notorious and Frightening Museums,https://articlesbypauletteklein.medium.com/a-peek-inside-the-house-of-terror-one-of-budapests-most-notorious-and-frightening-museums-e0249b4156d8,"Sign up

The Terror Museum isn’t your run-of-the-mill macabre haunted house type museum meant to temporarily scare you like a Hollywood movie. Instead, the terrors that took place inside this building are real, carried out by two separate regimes spanning from World War II to the Soviet communist area by their secret police.
The Terror Museum is located on the beautiful Andrassy Utca, one of Budapest’s most elegant boulevards with lush shady trees, stately apartment buildings, and high-end designer boutiques. This upscale bustling area of Budapest also has a dark and storied past. Nestled among the buildings on this posh street is where visitors will find the museum, which is one of Budapest’s most notorious and frightening buildings.
As I approached the entrance to the museum, I was struck with a surreal sensation knowing that this beautiful building was once the headquarters to both the Hungarian Arrow Cross Party (Hungary’s Nazi Party) and AVO/AVH Communist Terrorist Organizations. The building, if not for the iron platform with the words “Terror” adorning its roof, was a beautiful example baroque architecture and the words did little to prepare me for the history of horror that awaited me just beyond the entrance doors.
Before entering the museum I took some time to admire a piece of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain Memorial, a chain sculpture reminding visitors of the city’s dark history during Soviet rule.
The ground floor of the museum consists of the lobby, cafe, cloakroom, restrooms, and ticket counter. After passing through the ticket admission turnstile, I entered a 3-story courtyard that houses a Soviet tank sitting in a reflection pool and a gallery that showcases a haunting display of hundreds of black and white photographs of Hungarians who were the victims of the communist terror organizations.
The museum’s tour began on the 3rd floor where a labyrinth of exhibits guided me through the history of the building’s infamous past; starting with the story of the rise of the Hungarian Nazis (The Arrow Cross Party), the end of the Nazi regime, rise of communism in Hungary, and the resistance. The displays are a fascinating look at how the atrocities of terror organizations impacted the lives of the citizens of Budapest.
After passing through the exhibits of the top floor, the tour descends down a spiral staircase to the 2nd floor. Here I had an opportunity to learn about the history of the AVO/AVH terror organizations and the practices of their secret police. The exhibits feature communist propaganda, the life of people living under communism, the offices of the Gabor Peter, the Head of the Hungarian Political Police, as well as other exhibits to help one understand the terrors the citizens faced during this bleak and dangerous time in history.
From the museum’s second floor, I entered the elevator where the tour’s darkest part was about to take place. Learning about the history of terrors that took place was truly tragic, but what was hidden below in the building’s basement was even more terrifyingly evil.
As I made my way through a through a maze of dungeonous prison cells, interrogation rooms complete with the original torture equipment, execution rooms, and the heart-wrenching Hall of Tears featuring lit crosses in remembrance of the victims whose lives ended here, I was left shaken. Imaging the terror the victims must have felt as they endured days spent subject to horrific torture and worse in these cold grey stone walls was a bit overwhelming, to say the least.
As I exited the tour and stepped back out into the bright daylight and onto Andrassy Utca, my mind was still trying to process the evil that humans can do to one another. It was one of the museums that I wished didn’t exist, but believe must be visited in order to understand that the dark times of history should never be repeated. It was a museum that I will never forget.
The Terror Haus is one of the most powerfully moving museums in Europe and one that needs to be on your Budapest itinerary. The museum is open Tuesday to Sunday, 10:00 am to 6:00 pm and is located at 60 Andrassy Boulevard.

Travelling and seeing as many places as I can is a passion. It has never been solely about showcasing pictures just for the sake of it. It’s always been about the culture, community, language of communication, behaviour of the people, the structures, monuments, the history behind it and more such. It’s about knowing and absorbing and sharing this knowledge through written work and of course images corresponding to them.
Two days spent in Budapest, the capital of Hungary 🇭🇺 was like having been there for a long time. The way we devoured the sights of this city divided in two parts by the Danube River was just nothing short of amazing. This is an enchanting city with a vintage feel. Though the whole of Europe has an old world charm, there are differences in the structures and monuments from city to city.
We left on a Sunday morning by train from Vienna to Budapest with our daughter and family. It took only a little more than two and a half hours. The train was super comfortable where we could play card games with our little grandson who was our chief entertainer. Once there we took local trams and trains, hopping in and out of them to get around. But it was mostly a walking tour with our 4 year old in tow. He had his scooter and stroller when he required them. In his name we took a few ice cream and snack breaks. It was 35 degrees in the scorching sun which we combated with water, hats and sunscreen, running to the shaded parts of the promenades whenever possible.
After checking in at the hotel in Pest, we headed to Vajdahunyad Castle. It is a grand castle which has parts of buildings from different time periods displaying varied architectural styles. Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque. Its facade looks like a fairy tale castle. It’s an amazing amalgamation with a vast garden around it. This castle with vibrant stain glass windows, houses a museum of the Hungarian life over the years. It features their farming culture, use of animals such as cattle and horses. All the floors are lined with portrayals of the village life. Our grandson had an exciting time in the castle museum looking and touching all the stuffed real looking animals. He could even milk a fake cow.
The garden at the castle is vast, well tended and lush.
There is a sinister looking statue of a hooded person in the courtyard. It reminded me of ‘He who must not be named’ or Lord Voldemort from Harry Potter. It is the statue of Anonymus, created by Miklós Ligeti. Anonymus was a 12th-century chronicler whose real name remains a mystery. He served as a notary to King. He inspired the Dracula stories in books and movies. On the outer wall of the castle, there’s also a bust of Béla Lugosi, the Hungarian-American actor who is renowned for his role as Count Dracula in the original 1931 film.
While coming out of the castle grounds, we saw a hot air balloon at a distance. Naturally we walked towards it to go up in the air on it. When we approached the ticket counter and enquired we were told the balloon will go up only at 6 pm. It was only noon time and it was impossible to come back for it. We all felt ‘deflated’ by it.
Budapest is made up of two formerly separate cities, Buda and Pest, which lie on opposite sides of the Danube River. The Chain Bridge, which we saw from a distance, completed in 1849, was the first to connect them. In 1873, the two cities were officially unified under the name Budapest. We remained in the Pest side as we didn’t have time to go to Buda. Perhaps when we come next, we can only cover Buda, which apparently is a classier and more residential part of the city.
In spite of the intense heat, we lingered at the banks of the Danube which reflected the blue of the sky with a few boats floating on it. We saw the majestic looking Parliament building, which is the largest building in Hungary. Built in 1904, it’s a gothic structure influenced by the City Hall in Vienna. It’s declared as a UNESCO Heritage site.
While searching online for places to visit, my daughter came across this powerful memorial. Lined along the riverbank are worn looking cast iron shoes, symbolizing the Jewish victims shot into the Danube during World War II. Seeing it deeply moved me, as it brought the horrors of that time to life. This was created by film director Can Togay and sculptor Gyula Pauer. It honours Jews killed by members of the Arrow Cross Party. Victims were forced to remove their shoes before being shot, their bodies falling into the river. The memorial marks the place where they stood ..only their shoes remained.
The one regret I have is not having been able to go across the famous Chain Bridge to Buda. I looked at it longingly, the beauty of it enhanced by the blue of the Danube. Designed by English engineer William Tierney Clark and built by Scottish engineer Adam Clark, it was the first bridge across the Danube in Hungary. It was opened in 1849.
We stayed in Pest as it’s the livelier side, full of attractions, and it’s where most tourists end up wanting to spend their time in Budapest. It was crowded in the popular squares of the area where we stopped in shaded cafes to have cool drinks. Great for people watching. The Intercity Hotel was very comfortable. We slept well out of sheer exhaustion that night and had a filling breakfast in the morning.
Next day we went in search of The Metropolitan Ervin Szabó Library in Budapest, famous for its vintage interiors. It is a sprawling public library complex, with its main structure in an ornate 19th-century former palace, built in neo baroque style. Unfortunately we could not go into the classical side because there was a film shooting going on. What a disappointment! We had to make do with wandering in the less interesting part where there was a modern lending library. We admired the facade and had lunch at a near by open restaurant with our little hero making up games and running all around. I had an interesting salad with sun-dried tomatoes, red lettuce and Hungarian cheese topped with blueberry marmalade.
We debated going to Buda for a quick visit but we were not sure whether we would get back to the train station in time for our return. We decided to go and see the largest synagogue in Europe which was a few minutes walk away. It is a magnificent structure built between 1854 and 1859. It has twin octagonal towers topped by onion domes which has an oriental touch. The Star of David is embossed into the stone tablets. There is alternating yellow and red brick work on the imposing building ..standing the test of time.
Again sadly we could not go in because it was time to get back to our hotel for our luggage and head to the station. But we were happy to view the awe inspiring facade.
Some of the underground metro stations take you back in time like the late 1800s or early 1900s because of its vintage feel. It is compact and quaint in its tiled look with wooden benches and frames. Took me back into another era. Loved the ageless feeling while waiting for train which itself looked as if it was from another time long past. I visualised suited, hatted gentlemen with their canes or hooked umbrellas and slender women in long frocks and fashionable hats of that time waiting at the station.
I forgot to mention the street book shop that we saw while walking towards the Ervin Sazbo Library. It was heartening to see the lovely colourful cart with hoards of books surrounded by eager buyers. Mostly Hungarian books, so we didn’t delve further. We also passed by a big well organised secondhand book store with books from floor to ceiling.
Though there were hardly any books in English, it was a sight to behold and to be photographed.
On Sunday after our sightseeing and long walks in the hot sun, we went for dinner in a restaurant where they served beverages on little trains. This place was chosen for the youngest and most important traveller in our group. We ordered Hungarian food and drinks. It was fascinating to see the drinks coming on mini trains. There were railway tracks on every table. There was live music by musicians who came from table to table. They played a Greek song for us at our request along with Hungarian and German. It was a unique experience.
On our return train, I dozed off almost half the way vaguely listening to the little fella’s chatter like a lullaby in the background. Felt good to be back to our present turf reminiscing about the two days well spent in Budapest, thanks to our daughter and son in law. A special thanks to the little one for entertaining us all through.

Budapest is renown for its spas — even the zoo has one, with many animals having their own thermal baths (and, apparently, a very high reproductive rate). On a glorious spring day I stood outside the belle epoch Széchenyi Baths, the phrases ‘taking the waters’ and ‘frequented by royalty’ running through my mind. Even the entrance to the baths was a work of wonder.
Inside was all high ceilings and chandeliers. An authoritarian attendant ushered me into a small change room, returning later to lock my clothes away. I shared my change room with half a dozen others — this was no place for false modesty.
And so, to the waters. Outside were two enormous baths (one at 30 degrees C, the other at 34) with a lap pool between them. Inside were another 15 or so baths, each catering to different needs.

December 29, 2024
When you first step into a new city, the vibe tells you a lot. Specially, when you go in without much research, like we did for this one. So, stepping into Budapest after the loud and lively Vienna felt like entering a quieter, more mysterious world. As we climbed up the escalator from the train station, the crisp cold air hit our faces, and the glowing Liberty Bridge appeared in the distance arching over Danube. It was a quiet welcome, and something about it felt right. Calm and inviting — that was our first taste of Budapest.
The walk to our hotel was an easy 10 minutes. Although, in -2°C, dragging suitcases, while our fingers and nose slowly froze, we couldn’t help but admire the streets. That moment, in a way, set the tone for the rest of the trip: embracing the unexpected and finding joy in the little things. My North Face jacket and Alaska-grade boots were doing their job, but Dev, who’s always “too cool for layers,” was clearly questioning his decisions. The streets were quiet, dimly lit, and peaceful — a stark contrast to where we had come from. Tired but content, something about the city felt quietly intriguing.
December 30, 2024
Day 1: When Things Don’t Go as Planned
The next morning, we woke up later than usual. Laundry was the first task of the day — a necessity for anyone packing light on long trips. We tried this for the first time last year during our trip to France and Spain, and it was a game changer. We found a laundromat nearby and got our oat milk lattes while waiting for the cycles to finish. It was a slow start, but it felt good to take our time. Given our type A personalities of always being on the go — Dev, especially — and me being a mix of high-energy and sometimes slowing down, we’ve both been trying to deliberately pace ourselves. This trip somehow made it easier, as if the city’s vibe gently nudged us to slow down and be present. It even tied into my New Year’s resolution. How? I am not going to spoil it for you! You’ll find out towards the end.
Then came breakfast — or rather, the search for it. Most places were closed for the holidays, and Google’s “open now” wasn’t exactly reliable. Isn’t it funny how we still trust Google blindly, even after so many travel time fails? No? Just us? Anyway, we ended up wandering aimlessly for what felt like forever, hangry. Finally, we stumbled upon Napfényes Restaurant and Confectionery, a vegan Hungarian spot. We had vegan versions of authentic Hungarian food, including vegan goulash. The desserts were the real winners: a sponge cake that reminded me of tiramisu and soy yogurt “cottage cheese” balls. We devoured it! When sharing dessert somehow we eat faster! No? Again, Just us?! 😲
We enjoyed a long brunch and by the time we were done it was already noon, so with no specific plans for the day, we decided to just walk along the Danube. The river stretched out, with the Buda Castle standing tall in the backdrop— it was mesmerizing.
While I posed at multiple locations by the river and Dev happily played photographer, a guy proposed to his girlfriend right next to us. I was so in the moment that I missed their moment and realized it when I saw people congratulating them. (You’ll see the exact moment I finally saw it in the picture below) I was so bummed that I missed it, but it also made us feel so warm and happy to see the happy couple! Also, I didn’t forget the usual:
Me: “You never proposed to me like that.”
Dev: “I’ve been on my knees ever since.”
Dude’s got lines!
The foggy walk along the river was really romantic, which explains the proposal as well. It’s an amazing spot to propose — if that’s something you’re considering. Notice the bench, that’s where you can pretend to take a picture from behind while the other person faces the river. Perfect moment to get on your knees. Good luck!
I took this picture of Dev on that same spot before the proposal happened.
As we moved along, we saw a street vendor mulling wine on the side of the road. Unlike the machine-made ones in Vienna, this one was simmering on a stove. We grabbed some, and Dev downed his so fast he claimed, “Fefde jal gaye” (burnt my insides). But it warmed us up perfectly for the evening.
Continuing our walk, we came across the Jewish Memorial — iron shoes lined up along the riverbank. These shoes commemorate the Jews tragically executed during World War II at this very spot. It’s a haunting and humbling reminder of history’s darker moments.
Hungarian Parliament
From there, we turned right and saw it — the Hungarian Parliament — a jaw-dropping masterpiece of architecture. It’s one of the most stunning buildings we’ve ever seen! I had heard it’s even better from the inside, but we didn’t have tickets, and it was sold out due to holidays on that day. So we happily admired the exteriors of this exquisite detailed gothic and renaissance gem! Of course, this meant photos galore. Dev quipped, “Seriously, itni photos li hain ki Parliament Sharma gaya!” (We clicked so many pictures that the Parliament itself got shy!)
After all that, we decided to take a coffee break but we realized we were completely coffee-d out! So, I ordered water — because, fun fact, Europe and dehydration seem to go hand in hand for me. Unless I’m super intentional about drinking water, I always end up forgetting to hydrate. Quick tip: Make sure you sip a lot of water while traveling! Over Dev’s chai latte with oat milk, water, some vegan Lindt chocolate, and some more geeking out over architecture history, we enjoyed the lit up view of the parliament. Dev after over 10 years of being married to an architect is pretty caught up with his architectural history!
Honestly, these little pauses are becoming some of our favorite moments. ❤️
Evening Adventures: Ruin Bars and New Friends
After that, wondering what to do next, we decided to explore a street nearby called Andrassy Ut. After walking that street, we found a small vegan restaurant tucked in a basement. At first glance, we were hesitant, but the cozy, homely vibe inside won us over. The place was run by a mother-daughter duo, with the mother cooking in an open kitchen and the daughter managing everything else. I tried vegan cottage cheese pasta, while Dev had a burger. They were out of their vegan Hungarian goulash, much to my disappointment. After enjoying our meal, we left chatting and laughing, only to realize ten minutes later that our handbag was missing! Dev sprinted back to the restaurant and thankfully , we retrieved it without issue and after some deliberation decided to head to the Jewish Ruin Bars, a must-visit in Budapest. These bars, created in abandoned Jewish factories post-World War II, are now vibrant spots of nightlife. There, we ran into an Indian couple living in the UK and had such a great time talking that we completely lost track of time. By 11 PM — a late night for us — we realized how much fun we’d had and how unexpectedly we ended up celebrating what felt like an early New Year’s Eve with newfound friends. Moments like these truly make travel special!
December 31, 2024
Day 2: Lost and Found on Gellért Hill
We started our day nice and slow, waking up around 10 AM. After getting ready, we headed to Buda for the first time, curious to see what it was all about. Our main stop? The St. Gerard Sagredo Statue on Gellért Hill. Now, this place has quite a story — turns out St. Gerard was a priest who was thrown off the hill for his beliefs. Pretty tragic, but hey, now he’s got this massive statue and a hill named after him. Goes to show, if you stay true to yourself, you can leave a lasting mark on the world. The views from up there? Totally worth the climb. The winding roads to get there — foggy and lined with leafless dark trees — felt straight out of a movie.
From the statue, I got it into my head that we needed to explore more of the hill. I wanted to see the Liberty Statue, Hungary’s version of the Statue of Liberty, perched somewhere higher up in the mountain. So, off we went, walking past fancy mansions and more winding roads. We somehow found ourselves passing the Saudi Arabia Embassy and even saw a mansion that had once belonged to a wealthy family but was sold due to tragedy and is now a museum, I think. It felt like a little adventure in our quest to find the Liberty Statue. Maybe it was the fog, or maybe it was the construction happening around the castle at the top, but we didn’t find the statue.
Eventually, what we did find, was a cozy café called Füge Shop and Café. We sat down, sipped hot coffee, and just chilled for a bit!
As the evening rolled in, we crossed the bridge from Buda back to Pest for our boat tour on the Danube. If you want to see Budapest in all its glory, this is the way to do it. The Parliament and Buda Castle lit up at night? Stunning. If I may get poetic — the Parliament glowed like a golden crown against the night sky, its reflection shimmering in the Danube — a sight to remember. Nothing could stop us from stepping out of the heated seating area onto the deck for better views, and wow, it was worth it. A flock of shadowy black birds danced against the Parliament’s glowing backdrop, the chill of the air felt nice, and the Danube looked majestic as ever. It was one of those quiet, perfect moments for Dev and me, just soaking it all in. Oh, and let’s not forget the Spanish group of revelers who at that moment asked me to take their group shot. I obliged, and my iPhone .5 shot skills made them so happy! It was all happening.
After the hour-long tour, we walked back to our hotel for a quiet New Year’s Eve. Leftovers, packaged dal from Costco (warmed up by the hotel staff, pro move, right? Which the hotel manager noticed and told us, Hungarian tradition says if you eat lentils on new years eve you will have immense wealth the next year, well, we’ll take that!) some snacks, a complimentary bottle of wine from the hotel, video calls with family, some Bollywood party music, a little dancing, and just enjoying each other’s company.
New Years Day — Jan 01, 2025
Day 3: Vampires, Witches, and Spooky Stories
Waking up on the first of January, the first thing that popped into my head was my New Year’s resolution: spend less time on social media. Over the past year, I’d realized I’d developed a bit of an addiction to scrolling. Sure, I love sharing travel pictures for many reasons, but it started to feel counterproductive. (We’ll save that discussion for another day!) So, before I slept on New Year’s Eve, I boldly deleted my Instagram app.
Fast forward to the next morning — I woke up feeling good but immediately wanted to reinstall the app. Classic, right? But guess what? The universe was on my side because I couldn’t log back in! Logging in from Budapest locked me out, and I didn’t remember my password. Taking this as a sign from the stars, I decided to roll with it.
I shared this with Dev over breakfast, and he confessed he could also do with less Reddit and LinkedIn time. Boom — joint New Year’s resolution made! Feeling all kinds of inspired, we got ready and stepped out into a cloudy, rainy Budapest winter.
Eating out on New Year’s Day is tricky. Most places are closed, and the ones that are open are usually packed. Our first stop was a café, but the only vegan option was, literally, a freezing spirulina beach bowl. So we moved on. Eventually, we stumbled upon a fancy Michelin-starred restaurant. It wasn’t entirely vegan, but hey, it sounded like a New Year’s treat. And it was super fancy — the server unfolded my napkin and placed it on my lap. Not the most comfortable I’ve been in a moment!
I ordered a delicious spinach salad with tofu, while Dev went for an acai bowl and fries (the only other vegan options). Oh, and the breads were vegan and delicious. The food was top-notch, and we felt fancy AF starting our year like this. Again, not planned at all!
Next up was Buda Castle, sitting pretty on a hill. Armed with layers of clothing and our enthusiasm, we started the climb — stairs and all. The view from the top was stunning, but man, it was freezing!
Once we reached the castle, we saw massive lines for the museum and ticket counters. After a quick debate, we decided to skip the museum. Why? Because we wanted to be more intentional with our time. Instead of rushing through, we chose to go back to our hotel, relax, and recharge for our evening plans. So unlike us, right? I think it’s all about fighting the FOMO!
Back at the hotel, we couldn’t distract ourselves with our phones (thanks to the new resolution), so we turned on the TV. To our delight, there was an orchestra performance playing — it felt oddly perfect for the day. We snacked on leftovers, took a quick nap, and felt recharged for the evening.
Our evening began with street food (yes, pav bhaji in Budapest!) before heading out for our walking tour. We took a quick stroll around the winter market and the giant Ferris wheel, which had completely baffled me earlier. The blue glow it cast on the sky behind the buildings had left me wondering where it was coming from — until I finally saw the Ferris wheel and it all made sense.
Eastern Europe has a rich history of eerie tales, and this walking tour was a deep dive into them. We learned about Vlad the Impaler, the Romanian ruler who gruesomely killed his enemies. Vlad was later captured by a Hungarian emperor and imprisoned under Buda Castle. This gruesome history inspired the vampire legends we know today, including Dracula!
The craziest part? As our tour guide was dramatically recounting this story, a bystander — Romanian, of course — who was not at all happy about the story, interrupted to say Vlad wasn’t that bad. Who’s to say? Maybe we’ll have to visit Romania to find out. New trip idea alert?
Then there was the story of the Crying Widow, a woman who allegedly ran a hospital in her basement but used the blood of young girls to maintain her beauty. Oh, and another witch apparently ate children straight out of their graves. 😱. By the end of the tour, we were thoroughly spooked — especially since we had to walk down the castle hill alone.
We grabbed a cab back to the hotel that was 5 minute drive away. Not because it was late at night and we were spooked, duh!, only because we had an early start the next day. 😅
That night, we packed up and got ready for our early morning train to Bratislava.
Final Thoughts
Budapest wasn’t what we expected, because we didn’t really know what to expect. It was better. From wandering aimlessly to stumbling upon cozy cafés, and from Gothic architecture debates to spooky vampire tales, every unplanned moment added a layer to our journey. It reminded us that sometimes, letting go of plans is the best way to truly experience a place. The unplanned moments — getting lost, discovering hidden gems, and letting go of rigid plans — made it unforgettable. Sometimes, the best travel stories aren’t the ones you plan. They’re the ones that find you.

Our complete running guide to Budapest is now on the Great Runs site. Below is a quick summary.
Budapest, Hungary is a wonderful city for traveling, with wonderfully preserved architecture, great restaurants and bars, and a good transport infrastructure. It is the capital of Hungary and the country’s largest city, with a population of 3.3 million. There are lots of great places to go running in Budapest.
The best places to run in Budapest are all centrally located. The highlight is Margaret Island, a recreational mecca with several km of trails with great river and city views. There is also excellent running along the Danube, on both sides, although one should look carefully at our guide to learn the best sections. There are also some great parks for running: City Park (Varosliget), Bikás Park, and Orczy Park. And for some hills, head to Gellért Hill in Buda and run up to the Citudella (fort), or enjoy the more expansive Normafa park, a few km west of the city. One thing that’s unique about running in Budapest is that there are many places with rubberized running tracks, which are dedicated paths for runners. The longest is 5.3 km on Margaret Island. Many of these tracks also feature an open air fitness park, with machines for exercising.
Our full guide to running in Budapest is on the Great Runs site. Click on the links to each of these routes for full description and maps.

Will: Budapest has commonly been part of a list some people call “The Four B’s of Europe”.
Belgrade, Barcelona, Budapest, and Berlin.
These are widely considered the best party cities on the continent. “Party” is subjective, but the common theme between these cities is that they all have robust club and bar scenes that are famous for many reasons. Budapest is unique because the bars have a certain type of grit, which makes them mysterious. They are usually underground, decrepit, and extremely old. But this gives them an indescribable atmosphere.
Carolina: Throughout our relationship, Will and I constantly joke about the ""Hungarian caves"" as we like to call the Budapestian bars. Personally, while my days of party raging are behind me, I do enjoy an occasional ~causal clubbing~ night out and was excited to see what Budapest had to offer.
The expectations were: cheap drinks, quirky bars, and great house music.
If we haven't mentioned it already, I regret to inform you that it turns out Budapest isn't as cheap as they say. We were disappointed to find that drink prices were on par with what we commonly find in the U.S. — $5 beers and $12 cocktails. There were, however, a few spots closer to the local and low-key end of the spectrum that we truly enjoyed.
Kisüzem (1st and 2nd photos above) is a casual sit-down bar on the outskirts of the Jewish Quarter where Will and I got to enjoy $4 beers and $9 cocktails.
It was the perfect place to kick off a night out or even just to grab some drinks and chat. While the vibes of Kisüzem were very relaxed, it was extremely hard to score a table or even a windowsill to sit on outside. Most of the people were chatting in Hungarian — which made it seem like a popular spot amongst the locals.
Will: The most famous (probably) tourist bar in Budapest is known as Szimpla Kert (pictured above). It’s interchangeable with the “ruins bar” and is usually the first result on Google for the query “Best bars in Budapest”. When people say “ruins bars”, they are talking about this place, which is located in the heart of the Jewish Quarter. It’s a little confusing, but it’s not “bars” plural in the sense that there are individual “bars” within the building; Szimpla Kert is a bar that has several places to buy drinks within it. Makes sense?
It’s an incredible space with multiple levels and plenty of room to roam. Inside is straight out of a Jackson-Pollack-painting-come-to-life. Various, random knick-knacks cover the walls and ceiling while each room is draped in vibrant lights. As large as it is, they still manage to pack it night after night, especially in the high season. Caro and I tried to go on a Friday around midnight, and the line was horrid. The appeal of this place is valid, and I’ll say it’s a definite must if you’re planning on going out to Budapest. Price-wise you can expect beers ranging from $5-$9 and cocktails for about $9–$13.
Carolina: Szimpla Kert is truly a sight to behold. A big part of the experience is getting lost in the maze of bars. Each one of them has its unique atmosphere. However, don't mistake this for a bar to go dancing at. While they do play music, there isn't a dance floor. Instead, there are tables where people gather around and sit to talk or play cards like we did.
Will: When it’s time to go dancing, there is one option that could satisfy everybody’s musical taste. It’s called Instant/Fogas, and it’s the most insane club I’ve ever seen. For Caro and I, this was it — the CAVES!
It has 6 (yes, 6) different rooms. On the entry floor, there are two large dance halls, one playing house music and the other playing general pop and throwback dance bangers from the likes of Madonna, Lady Gaga, Brittany, and Black Eyed Peas. The entry floor also has 4 to 5 bars, so getting a drink is no issue.
Downstairs, however, below the street, is where the complexity of Fogas can be truly celebrated. The Fogas underground features three distinct caves: heavy metal & rock, techno, and deep house. Each is separated by thick concrete and has its own bar. Being down there makes you feel incredibly edgy, but downstairs is where Fogas is the most fun. The music is great, the rooms are very spacious, and the overall vibe can’t be replicated. Granted, there are other underground bars in Budapest, but none like this. You feel the mysteriousness and grit of the city in a very unique way.
Carolina: For someone who likes to go dancing and has a Frankenstein music taste like mine, the Instant-Fogas Complex was a dream come true. However, I gotta say that there was another bar that stood out against all others. That was Viadukt, a Danube-side bar hidden underneath the trolley tracks.
During the day, the bar's green-painted metal doors are hard to distinguish from the other ones that are part of the viaduct where the trolly passes through. At night, the road becomes pedestrian-only, a black canopy tent is set up outside with a DJ playing house music sets, and tables and chairs distributed among the Danube bank. The green metal doors are wide open and the inside is decorated with an exhibition from a local artist. There's plenty of space to dance by the DJ and to sit and chat a bit further where the music isn't as loud. Regardless of where you decide to hang out, you get to enjoy the gorgeous lights of Buda across the river as well as a view of the Széchenyi Chain Bridge.
Both Viadukt and Instant-Fogas served their drinks in reusable branded plastic cups which Will and I kept. So, if we host you once we're back home, there's a chance that you might get to enjoy a drink from the cups we brought from Budapest.

I created a video about Budapest, Hungary’s capital, for the “Connecting cities” project. I took these photos while I was with the Erasmus program there, and I wanted to share with you my once in a lifetime experience! Enjoy! #connectingCities
Last year I was given the opportunity to participate in the Erasmus program. The city I was chosen to go was Budapest. As a student there I made a lot of friends, with most of them coming from other countries and cultures. As you can imagine, I broadened my horizons, I shifted my perspective about a variety of things and, as a result, I changed a lot about my way of thinking. My stay abroad was for one academic semester (about 6 months), where I was a student at Karoli Gaspar University! In particular, Erasmus is actually an exchange program between European Universities, in which students from European countries connect, collaborate and share their feelings and ideas with each other, while studying in a foreign country. In this way, students become more open-minded and self-confident.
Now, its time for me to show you some of the main attractions that Budapest is famous for, including what I felt and what I thought while being there. Also, I will try to make a comparison of these attractions to the Greek culture and natural heritage, trying to find out the similarities between these two ostensibly different countries, Hungary and Greece.
To begin with, one of the most famous attractions in Budapest, and Hungary in general, is the Danube river. While gazing the Danube river and its calm waves, I surely admired the serenity and the beauty of Hungary’s nature. It is such a nice place, where there are a lot of small kiosks, coffee shops and restaurants, in which you can enjoy this breathtaking landscape and view. It is definitely a place where even your deepest thoughts can be unfolded. Once, while I was drinking my cup of hot chocolate during a boat cruise through the river, it felt like I was in a sailing boat into the Aegean sea. Instantly, the lyrics of Randy Newman’s song came across my mind… ‘’I am looking at the river but I am thinking of the sea’’. Many feelings passed through me and along with this, the sense of nostalgia of the sea and my country made me feel that I am into the Aegean again.
It is said that one of the best known attractions of Budapest is “The Fisherman’s Bastion”, which was built in the 19th century. The Bastion is a castle named after the guild of fishermen that was responsible for defending the stretch of the city walls in the Middle Ages. At this time, it is a city viewing terrace, with a lot of stairs and walking paths, and serves the best panoramic view in Budapest! It is a spot that many tourists visit, in order to take amazing photos of the view and, of course, themselves, for remembering their holidays! Needless to say, the architectural style and placement of the castle makes you feel like you are a part of a fairy tale, by taking you back in time, especially in the wintertime.
When I started finding out more about the city, I discovered that, not only the close to Danube side of Budapest is amazing, but also the other districts both Buda and Pest. For example, there is an enormous square called ‘’Heroes square’’ in which huge buildings and monuments are exhibited. I recall that a guide was telling us once the detailed history of the square, and we were all amazed about how similar the Greek and Hungarian architecture was. For instance, the Museum’s of Fine Arts designers were inspired by the ancient temples of Greece, and that’s why the front of the building is classical with massive Corinthian columns. Apart from that, its exhibitions contain pieces of art from Ancient Greece and Rome, which is something that made me feel really proud.
In my opinion, Budapest is definitely a suitable place for traveling, but only someone who lives there can ascertain how the everyday life and behavior of its local citizens is. As a student there, sometimes I had reservations about some specific things, such as not being accompanied while walking home. But that’s an apprehension I would have in any city that I am not familiar with. In general, Budapest is considered an overcrowded city and people there are kind-hearten and open-minded, such as many Greeks are.
If you go to the city center of Budapest during the Christmas time, you will find small wooden houses selling traditional Hungarian, sweets, food and art, and everything smells cinnamon and coconut. Its typically called the “Christmas Market” and you will surely have a blast while being there!
While spending 6 months there, I tried to taste all kinds of different traditional Hungarian food. My main conclusion was that their recipes were similar with the Greek ones, but Hungarians use more spices and bigger amounts of garlic and onion. As an example to the above, both Hungary and Greece have a traditional recipe for stuffed peppers. In Greece this recipe is called ‘’Gemista’’, and apart from peppers, stuffed tomatoes and other vegetables may also be included. In Hungary, its called ‘’Töltött paprika’’ and, by default, there are only stuffed peppers included. In Greece, “Gemista” is stuffed with minced meat, rice, garlic, tomato sauce, onions and oil olive while in Hungary, it is stuffed with pork, rice, onion, garlic, paprika and tomato sauce. So, you can imagine how similar these recipes are to each other, despite the small differences that may occur.
Additionally, I need to write about the baroque style that characterizes Budapest. While walking around the city, the roads and the buildings make you feel like you are starring in a mystery movie! Most of European countries are conducted with this architectural style, which is why they are considered to be so “unique” and “special” compared to other countries. In Budapest, you will notice these buildings of Baroque architecture mainly in the castle district, but also in the Szechenyi Thermal baths, the Royal palace and St. Anna’s Church. This style makes the city an absolute architectural paradise!
Now days, there is a situation which many countries are facing, mainly due to the financial crisis that hit the European Union. Unfortunately, in both Budapest and Athens, are a lot of homeless people and their number is constantly being increased. Most of them are living in subway stations, underpasses, parks and areas with high criminality rates. A high percentage of them are drug addicts and alcoholics. The problem in both Budapest and Athens is that there aren’t enough shelters that can provide a descent place to live to those who can’t afford it. So, inevitably, they end up living in the streets. For example, as a solution to this unfortunate situation, the City Hall of Athens is planning to open an overnight shelter for the capital’s homeless, but this kind of plan needs a lot of effort and time to be invested in order to be successful soon enough.In conclusion, we realize that these two cities, Budapest and Athens, have come to deal with poverty due to all the problems caused by the financial crisis. As a case in point, the high level of unemployment was a fatal factor for the loss of many homes, which led to the increased number of homeless people all around the county.
If you are a new Erasmus student, don’t worry, you will quickly make a lot new friends from a bunch of different countries! Erasmus students are very friendly and open to new friendships and experiences. I remember the very first course where we got to meet each other. That course was the Hungarian language one, and my first thought about it was that the difficulty was pretty much the same as the Greek one. All the Erasmus students were joking about the difficulty of the language, and how we could cope with it. We couldn’t even pronounce the words in the right way! It’s really hard to speak Hungarian fluently…
Fortunately, 6 months are enough to find out a lot of hints about living in Budapest, and of course to get along with them too. I have to admit that I am really glad about choosing Budapest as my Erasmus destination. I gained a lot of experiences, felt a lot of emotions and I had the chance to bond with so many people from around the world! I strongly believe that if it wasn’t for Budapest, I wouldn’t be able to understand how much my country relates or differentiates with another one, or how identical or opposite it can be in various aspects! I would definitely not change a thing!

Will: We arrived in Budapest extremely hungry (see what I did there?). After disembarking from another lovely Flixbus trip, it was time to find our next home away from home.
Our Air BnB is in a popular area of the city called Oktogon. It’s a lively section of town full of restaurants, bars, shops, hotels, and grocery stores. We had no issues checking into our Air Bnb, and after a brief respite, it was time for dinner. Using our trusty dusty Happy Cow app we found a Mediterranean restaurant cheffing up some amazing salad bowls. Tucked in the Jewish Quarter, the owners welcomed us with big smiles and loaded us up with some felafel balls atop a bed of quinoa, salad greens, beats, and hummus. Post dinner we considered joining the masses in having a few drinks, but the travel day wore us out more than we anticipated. No need to rush it — we’ll be here all month!
Sunday was a settling-in type of day, and we had a mission.
Acquainting yourself with a brand-new city is fun in many ways; we’re learning to see its joy instead of overwhelming ourselves. Google Maps has become our best friend, and finding the most informative local blogs online has become a refined skill.
It might not seem like a real skill, but there are plenty of opportunities to be led astray when relying on the internet.
Carolina: As I'm writing this 22 days after ""moving"" to Budapest, I forget exactly the order of happenings for this day. But, as Will mentioned, we had some missions for Sunday.
For groceries, we gravitated towards Spar since that's the grocery chain we grew accustomed to in Zagreb. However, the Spar location near us wasn't the greatest — the quality of the veggies and variety was subpar, same could be said for their selection of vegan proteins, coffee, milk, and pasta. In the coming days we discovered that just across the street, there was a small local grocery chain (G Roby) that had everything we needed and more.
For the gym, we decided to tour a few spots. First, Nr1 Fitness — a 24/7 gym inside of what seemed to be an office building. As we walked in, we encountered a receptionist who, in broken English, told us that the gym was independent of the offices so she didn't have access to it. We decided to go check it out anyway behind the glass doors. As we did, two gym members came into the building and as they unlocked the doors to the gym, we slipped in with them.
The gym was small but not busy. It was a bit warm but it had everything we were looking for — ""It will be a good sweat session, kind of like hot yoga"" we told each other.
We then walked to 4% Fitness Corner — which is exactly what you would expect from a Budapest gym. House music booming through the speakers, cage-like room dividers, and muscle tees everywhere. It was only $10 extra than the other gym but there was more space, more machines, and the AC worked.
After touring the gyms, we decided to grab lunch and weigh our options. We walked to Kozmosz, an underground restaurant that serves vegan versions of traditional Hungarian dishes. Over chocolate-covered layered cake and coffee, we re-read the reviews for Nr1 and 4% and found out that many people had a hard time canceling their membership with Nr1, asking for a cancelation, still being charged, and not being able to get their money back. Now that's a problem we don't want to have. As we had discovered from our tours, 4% accepted cash payments. Additionally, there were no complaints of scammy business practices.
On the following day, we showed up at 4% and paid a month's worth of cash membership. And just like that, we had a gym.
Will: But what about when you’re suffering from screen fatigue? What is a way to explore a city without a phone? Caro and I have found going for a run works brilliantly.
Carolina: Going on casual runs has to be one of my favorite ways to explore somewhere. I say ""casual"" because the main objective of these runs isn't to hit a specific distance or keep at a certain pace. The objective is to go somewhere you've never been and see new things. To take the the byway just to see what it leads to. In these runs, it's more than okay to stop to take in the scenery, as the objective isn't to run.
That's how we decided to spend our first Sunday evening in Budapest. We ran up the street that connects Oktogon to the Budapest City Park — Andrássy út. Passing by gorgeous buildings such as HAB (Hungarian Art and Business), and the Alice Hotel. To reach the park, we ran around Hero's Square where we got a gorgeous view of the sunset (see picture below).
At the park, we ran aimlessly, allowing ourselves to get lost in the network of trails and pathways that cut through the park. At some point, we found ourselves at a Wine & Food festival (typical) in the shadows of the Vajdahunyad Castle. We also explored the park's extensive recreational sports infrastructures, and of course, the Széchenyi Thermal Bath.
On our way back, passing through the Hero's Square once again, we came across a Star Wars meet-up, over 200 people holding blue and red lightsabers. It was truly a sight to be seen.
Arriving back at Oktogon, we were lured into a local Pizza chain by the smell of baked dough, tomato sauce, and cheese. To my content, they had a veggie pizza option with no cheese. So we wrapped up another wholesome day with 2 slices of cheese-less pizza.

· Walking across the chain bridge: It is one of the most amazing bridges in the whole wide world which you would love to explore during your vacation. It happens to be the first bridge to connect Buda and Pest together and the constriction was completed in 1849. Do not miss going for a leisurely stroll across the bridge in the evening when it is all lit up for enjoying every bit of the trip. Stay at the Corinthia Hotel Budapest for exploring the attractions thoroughly.
· Taste the impeccable wine: Visit the Faust Wine Cellar which offers a beautiful setting and you can be sure to leave your tasting with a great understanding of Hungarian wines.
· Buda Castle: If you wish to explore the world that lies beneath Buda Pest then the Labyrinth of Buda Castle is what you should aim for. It is one of the seven wonders of the underground world and is eminent for adding to its mysterious allure. It happened to be closed down in 2011 after the police had raided it. One mile of the six miles can be explored and this rule has been set since it has re-opened.
These are some of the places of interest that are worth exploring while coming over to the exquisite city of Budapest.

Few days after I came back from Trieste, I had lined up another trip, and this type it was sort of a vacation. Except that it wasn’t, since it was a summer school with a full 9–5 schedule and all that. But it was summer and I was going to be there for a week, so for me it was like taking a vacation trip!
This was my second time in Budapest, since I visited the city previously in 2016, but back then it was November and pretty cold, so I didn’t get to fully experience the city, the agenda was packed so I only got to see a little bit from the night life, which had intrigued me and I knew that sooner or later I would return to finish the job.
Also one big difference since the previous trip was that now I was staying at Pest — the bohemian part of the city, while the first time I was situated at Buda — the part with the hills and castles.
I got a really cheap flight from Skopje, like 40 Euros a round trip, which was a great deal considering that the first time I had to take THREE flights just to get to Budapest and additional two on the way back.
As soon as I got to my accommodation, the Ludovika Kampus Dormitory — which was fairly easy to find, I met my roommates, Pranav from Nepal and Yahya from Pakistan.
Since our dinner was scheduled for later that evening, we went to have coffee in the centre and to do some sightseeing. Some places were familiar to me, the St. Stephen Basilica and the famous Hungarian Parliament (which amazes me every time I see it).
Since Pranav and Yahya hadn’t been to the city before I showed them some of sights that I knew, the weather was great so we took a walk and after that we had some coffee. Soon it was time to go back and to prepare for the dinner where would meet that rest of the participants at the summer school.
The organizers had also provided us with public transport tickets for the whole week, so this was particularly useful since we could use whatever we like — the subway, trams, buses, even ferries!
Soon we met up with the rest of the participants, so there I’d meet the people with who I would spent the next week — Bernat from Catalunya, Silva from Italy, Leonie and Nina from Germany, fellow Balkanian Stere from Romania, Heidi from US/Netherlands, Celine from China, my great friend Vassiliki from Greece, Zuhair from Iraqi Kurdistan and many more.
During the next few days we got to hear some interesting lecture on populism and it’s rapid rise in Europe — but I also got to learn that it wasn’t just a problem that the EU is dealing with, but that the struggle is real for other parts in the world as well.
At that time the situation was also beginning to become complicated in Catalunya and Iraqi Kurdistan — so it was great to share some opinions and discuss the matter.
It was quite nice that we were in Hungary and discussing this topic — since we all know about Viktor Orban and his policy towards refugees. This added another dimension to the discussions and we heard some interesting points, coming from the Hungarian side, or at least some Hungarian experts that took part as lecturers.
So the next five days during the days we we’re discussing and researching this topics, while at nights we were discovering Budapest’s amazing nightlife! One of my favorite things from the Budapest nightlife is the vast number of ruin pubs throughout the city, and during that week we probably got to see like close to 10 different ruin pubs.
The first night we went to my favorite spot, the one that I visited three nights in a row during my last trip — Szimpla Kert! So basically this is like bar, that is set in a garden (or maybe the garden is set inside of a bar) and it has all kind of cool stuff — like old phones, chairs, chandeliers, video arcades — the place has everything, plus some quality drinks and it’s packed with tourists!
The first night we went there with Heidi and Stere, while most of the others were already tired, but the next night we also went to this place and had a great time!
However, during the next few days we got to some see different places and what I can say is that we weren’t disappoint! Budapest has so many ruin pubs to offer, so I’d definitely recommend that if you go there, go to Szimpla Kert for a while, and then visit some other places as well!
So one night we went to this place Golya Presso — also a ruin pub but much smaller than Szimpla but quite similar in a way. A Hungarian friend of mine, Zoltan, told me before that this place was sort of a hub for the leftists, and it definitely had that kind of atmosphere — especially it’s enterier.
Another night we went to this Red Ruin — by the name you can guess what kind place of it was –filled up communist memorabilia and Stalin, Mao, Lenin etc caricatures on the walls.
Has some beer and some palinka there — I have to admit that I could managed to drink just one shot of palinka, since in my opinion it was terrible — rakija is way better than that! We met some crazy drunk people there — one of them was a drunk barking man who scared couple of dogs that were inside the pub (sounds weird but it happened).
One more place that left a good impression on me was this ruin pub called Ankerts, where they had some great draft beer, good music and atmosphere, but unfortunately we didn’t stay there for too long.
During the day, beside the lectures, once or twice we also went around the city, on the Danube bank and it was pretty awesome to watch the sunset there and to have some drinks.
I love this city since it has it all — great architecture with a lot of history, awesome nightlife and good public transport — which means that you can truly get a great experience!
But I’d recommend going there during spring or summer, winter is not really friendly if you want to go and do some sightseeing. Budapest is especially breathtaking at night, with it’s shining lights — the Parliament building is just marvelous at night! The bridges on the Danube are quite the gem too, especially Szechenyi bridge!
I didn’t go to the Buda part this time, since most of the days we had activities and always stayed on the Pest side, which was full of nice surprises on every corner.
On the last day before we departed, actually it was our free day, we took a ferry on the Danube and visited the little riverside town of Szentendre,or as Lilit from Armenia would describe — a Serbian-style art town!
Beautiful small city with a big Serbian minority there and signs around the place that I could actually read — since they were written in cyrilics.
We had great lunch there — gulash inside a bread dish (I guess I can call it like this). We had gulash multiple times that week and other than that I can also remember eating one dessert that was really to die for — called Samloi Galushka.
The rest of the food we had was mostly international — we ate pasta, hummus, pizza, etc.
I guess that it actually was a vacation, beside all of the lectures and discussions, so during that week in Budapest I had fun, met some amazing people again, and learned a lot of new and cool stuff. The last day I had my flight in the morning, so basically it was time to go back to reality once again.

I knew the Danube River and Hungary at a very young age because of piano — Johann Strauss’s “The Blue Danube”. Nearly 15 years later, in 2014, I finally paid a visit to Hungary.
The Danube river is like a belt twining in the mid Europe. Budapest, straddles the banks of the Danube River, and the buildings in the city are pearls on the Danube belt. I arrived at Budapest at the end of April, as an unprecedented heat wave washed over Europe — from Berlin ,Warsaw, Krakow, Prague, to Budapest, the heat wave was chasing me, along with sudden showers that often arrived late afternoon. When it was not raining, the earth was shrouded in heat radiation.
Budapest used to be two cities — Buda, and Pest. Buda was the capital city, and is presently the capitol. Across the river, Pest is 2 times bigger, where most of the city residents live.
The front foot of Pest was already in modernity, everywhere is Costa Coffee,European version of Starbucks, and every car has a European Union’s license plate, indicating the reform and transition of Hungary; and the back foot was still halted in the old time, as trolleys in 1950s styles were still running, and the marble exterior of most buildings were with had turned into yellow over the years. Pest barely had urban forestry. Exposure to excessive sunlight in late April had melted my skin, as if was some sort of ice cream. Perhaps a while back ago, Pest did have sufficient street trees, but those trees withered. There were always a few corners of the street, full of overgrown glasses, existing there alone without the accompany of street tress.
I did some of my schoolwork (I was an exchange student in a university at Germany) on the first night at a Costa. The coffee shop was quite empty, I was facing a window covered by raindrops that look like crystal sticking on the glass window, reflecting the night light on the street. Only one waitress was serving behind the bar, and she was as young as me. I biked along the river bank crossed the bridge between Buda and pest, again and again. Even Pest was where most of the city population resided, its streets were quite empty, besides a bunch of tourists sitting on the outdoor seating of the cafés around the street corners.
Then the late afternoon rain started dropping. I hided in a Costa Coffee until the rain died down. I paddled the bike over the stone road shining like mirror after the shower. When I got back to the hostel we stayed, I ordered some dishes from the Turkish restaurant across the street — Budapest used to be the biggest Jewish populated city. Millions of Jews were transported to Auschwitz from this city. It’s also the biggest resided city of Romanic people, now, it also a population of Turkish immigrants.
I fled to a Costa coffee until The last night at Budapest, before our departure back to Germany, we met our temporary roommate in the hostel, a Korean lady, around 40 years old- she was single, just quitted her job, flied from South Korea to the European continent, travel alone around Europe. She slept on the upper level of the bunk bed, above me.

Let me tell you something upfront — Budapest isn’t the kind of city that screams for your attention like Paris or New York. It doesn’t shove its famous landmarks in your face. Instead, Budapest whispers. It draws you in quietly, one crumbling facade, one steaming chimney, one café window at a time. You don’t just “visit” Budapest — you drift through it.
I’ve walked these streets on misty winter mornings when the Danube looks like a silver ribbon cutting through the grey, and I’ve wandered them under the lazy orange glow of summer evenings when locals sit outside sipping fröccs and laughing like they’ve got all the time in the world. Budapest’s charm lives not only in its grand buildings but in the cracks between them.
This post isn’t about the tourist checklist. You already know the Parliament building looks like a gothic wedding cake and that the Chain Bridge is Instagram-worthy from every angle. I want to talk about the streets, the people, the smells, the awkward little corners where life in Budapest feels raw, imperfect, and utterly human.
You know you’re in the real Budapest when the sidewalks get uneven. The main boulevards — Andrássy Avenue, for example — are polished and postcard-perfect. But duck into the side streets, and suddenly the city exhales. Laundry flaps in courtyards, tiny grocery stores glow under flickering neon, old women with floral scarves shuffle along clutching plastic bags, and young students sit on crumbling stoops scrolling on their phones.
There’s graffiti here — some of it art, some of it just bored teenagers marking territory. But the layers of history are impossible to miss. You’ll pass an art nouveau balcony hanging precariously over a 1970s shoe repair shop. Above, the cracked stucco peels like old paint, revealing the city’s stubborn spirit underneath.
Walk around District VIII — Józsefváros. It’s raw, rough around the edges, but it’s real. Here, hip cafés with Edison bulbs and oat milk lattes sit side-by-side with corner bars where old men drink Unicum and mutter about politics. If you want shiny, sanitized Europe — this isn’t it. But if you want life? Welcome to Budapest.
Budapest has a specific smell — part bakery, part car exhaust, part sweet paprika floating from someone’s kitchen window. And yes, sometimes a hint of cigarettes — Hungarians smoke like it’s still 1995. But that mixture? It feels like a real city. A city where people live, not just pose for photos.
Stop by a pékség (bakery) in the morning. The langos might already be sizzling in oil, but most locals are grabbing simple pastries — kifli (crescent rolls), túrós batyu (sweet cheese pockets), maybe a slice of pogácsa (savory scone) if they skipped breakfast. Coffee? Strong. Cheap. No nonsense. Just the way it should be.
Here’s what I love — Budapest locals don’t care that you’re a tourist. They’re not rude, they’re not overly friendly — they’re just… doing their thing. If you want to fit in, keep your voice down, your head up, and your eyes open. Don’t expect big grins and “How’s your day going?” — this isn’t Disneyland. But ask for directions? Most people will help. Stumble through a few words in Hungarian? Their eyes soften immediately.
My favorite? Watching older folks play chess in the parks, completely oblivious to the TikTok kids filming dance videos nearby. It’s two worlds colliding — but that’s Budapest.
Skip the overpriced tourist menus on Váci Street. Head to the side streets for hearty, grandmother-approved meals. Goulash soup in a steaming ceramic bowl. Crispy duck legs with red cabbage. Cheap, buttery nokedli dumplings. It’s heavy. It’s filling. It’s perfect for cold evenings when your breath fogs the air.
And the bakeries? Let me say it again — never underestimate a Hungarian pastry.
Okay, let’s get real for a second. Budapest might feel like another world, but getting here isn’t rocket science.
Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport (BUD) welcomes budget airlines and major carriers alike. From most European cities, flights hover around €30–€100 if you book smart. From the US? Expect around $500–$800 round-trip, depending on the season.
Skip the overpriced taxis at arrivals. The 100E Airport Bus runs straight to the city center for about €5. Runs every 20 minutes. Easy.
It wasn’t the fancy cafés or grand architecture. It was this random Tuesday morning in early spring. Light drizzle. Streets still wet from rain. I ducked into a tiny coffee shop off Kálvin tér. The window fogged up as I sipped bitter coffee and listened to Hungarian indie rock playing softly. Outside, people hurried past with umbrellas, the city carrying on, oblivious to my little moment of stillness.
That? That’s why I travel. Not for the bucket list. For the seconds in between.
Budapest is rough around the edges, sometimes crumbling, often unpredictable — but never fake. It doesn’t try to impress you with perfection. It lets you discover its flaws, its beauty, its rhythm — and decide for yourself.
You might not “fall in love” instantly. But give it time. Walk the streets. Breathe in the mix of pastry, paprika, and city life. Listen to the language you don’t understand but somehow feels familiar.
And when you leave? You’ll miss it — I promise.

I know this is a blog about photography, but it’s also a blog about the way that we create and interpret imagery. I find Wes Anderson’s films a perfect focal point for this discussion about image, storytelling, and framing. Both because of what people seem to inherently understand about Anderson’s unique aesthetic, and also because of what people regularly misrepresent or ignore.
I’m not going to introduce Wes Anderson because if you’re reading this, you know his films. We all have our favourites- often the films which got us started with his 50s toned, highly symmetrical movies (mine is Rushmore). Today I’ll be talking about 2014’s The Grand Budapest Hotel and later about 2021’s The French Dispatch, because these films present (to me) a progression of Anderson’s use of the cinematic frame as a storytelling device.
Note on history of format and aspect ratio
35mm motion picture film- that is, the film itself- wasn’t a particularly revelatory technology. Industrial processing for 70mm photographic roll film was already established, and filmmaker WK Dickson found that by splitting the roll in half you got two 35mm rolls which were ample enough to capture the image rendered by lenses of the time.
Like many stories in early film history, Thomas Edison stuck his head in, forcing Dickson to spend the next five years attempting in vain to establish a new standard. But in the end and to this day, the economics of 35mm film have kept it as the standard, first capitalising on 70mm film industrialization, and later on its own mass production before any other format had the chance to get off the ground.
Traditional spherical lenses project a circular image. We cut the sides off for convenience and to avoid the outside edges of the image circle, which tend to be blurry. The most judicious use of the image circle (beyond simply leaving it circular) is to square it, which remains the standard in some large format photography. This square is, however, at odds with human perception. Every person experiences vision differently, but with two round eyes spaced apart, we can fairly assume that most people see the world significantly wider than square, and the history of aspect ratio is the economics and technology of rendering a cinematic image that better resembles our own eyes.
Early widescreen was limited by lens and film fidelity. You can only cut so far into your image before degrading the quality, widescreen had some success in using larger format 70mm film, but the most common ratios sat around 4:3. A slightly wider square, which was codified as the Academy Ratio after sound was added to movies.
The 4:3 academy frame was wider than square, without significantly reducing the amount of film (and ergo fidelity) used by each frame. Throughout the 1930s and 40s the Great Depression cut into discretionary spending, 70mm film was considered too expensive to use, and further widescreen advances lay dormant.
By the 1950s, the mainstream adoption of television forced filmmakers to innovate. Widescreen implementations which were as simple as changing the matte in a projector were only possible by letterboxing already small tv screens.
In 1952, 20th Century Fox bought rights to a military technology which allowed for wide angle viewing from inside tanks via oval lenses, and coming out with The Robe a year later– the first film shot in ‘scope’ format. Anamorphic lenses squeeze the image on the way into the film plane, allowing twice as much width to fit into a piece of film. The image is in turn desqueezed by the projector, turning a 4:3 frame of 35mm film into a 1:2.9 image. In 1954 Vistavision was established as a more economical way to widen screens, flipping 35mm negative sideways to give an aspect of 1:1.5 which could be further cropped to 1:2 and the modern television standard 1:1.85 (16:9).
Aspect Ratio in The Grand Budapest Hotel
The Grand Budapest Hotel is a nesting doll of narratives. We open to the shrine of a dead author, a visitor holds a book (The Grand Budapest Hotel), and turns to the author’s picture on the back cover. We match cut to the author in an office in 1985, the author tells us about the way stories fall into your lap once the world knows your an author. The aspect ratio changes to 1:1.85 (16:9).
The film is going to pull this menouvre on us often, and it’s keen to make us aware that multiple threads of storytelling are going to take place. It also wants us to know that these stories are being buffed a little with a polish of nostalgic recollection. When our author calls the hotel, “a picturesque, elaborate and once widely celebrated establishment” we cut again to 4:3, and a bright pink hotel reveals itself against an obvious matte painting and a foreground of dimensionless buildings. This part of the story, the filmmaking insists, is literally flattened by layers of recollection as the author character declares, “The incidents that follow were described to me exactly as I present them here, and in a wholly unexpected way.”
Through the remainder of Grand Budapest the moving frame lines serve to remind us not only that there are multiple timelines, but that each timeline is filtered through its own series of storytellers. Wes Anderson’s visuals get flack for being so easily identifiable, but they have an in-text justification in Grand Budapest, where the further removed our author gets from the action, the more the world takes on qualities of the fanciful and make-believe.
Throughout the film, danger is framed by windows- the Zubrowkan army enter the film via a train window, they are spied through a window in the hotel, and Dmitri’s henchman Joplin pursues Deputy Kovacs, first visible through a bus window: Danger abounds, but the existential threat of war seems almost out of scope with the limitations of the story. In the scene of Gustave’s death the frame is robbed of its intense colour, too raw still for Zero the storyteller (Agatha’s death is given no screen time, only narration over imagery of their wedding.)
Why?
So the movie is a nesting doll of different narratives which get progressively distorted through storytelling. It’s a study in the stories we tell, the people and places, we remember, and how we remember them. But also. Why?
Why 4:3 (1.375:1 for pedants), 1.85:1, and 2.35:1? Each time period in the film lines up with the mainstream adoption of that aspect ratio, and so the changing aspect ratios can be considered another part of the set design, which changes dramatically from timeline to timeline. As the browning halls of the 1968 Hotel are rendered in brilliant pinks and reds when we flash back to 1932, so too does the ceiling of the cinematic frame literally grow taller. The perspective literally grows wider and- perhaps- more nuanced- with the historical perspective. Does the film suggest that we’re so far removed from the 30s that what we can perceive is literally cut off on the sides? It’s for you to decide.
It may seem quite contrived to suggest that the narrowing aspect ratio represents a neglecting of the edges of our historical perception, but evidence for this can be found in the text. Our dual protagonists, Zero and Gustave, are a refugee and a bisexual, respectively. Theirs are stories which have been sidelined throughout history, and positioning them in this historical context- even in what remains a comedic romp for most of its runtime. Asks us as audience to consider what stories and characters like Zero and Gustave have been sidelined.
Wes Anderson’s movies draw attention to their own filmmaking to the point of easy categorisation and parody. But too often I believe people categorise as an easy out from analysis.
The estrangement effect has roots in Chinese theatre and Russian Formalism, but was codified into Western theatre by Bertolt Brecht. Brecht’s aim for the estrangement effect (verfremdungseffekt) was that breaking the illusion, and reminding the audience that they were viewing a piece of fiction would force them to engage with the underlying politics. Wikipedia’s description is quite elegant:
“By disclosing and making obvious the manipulative contrivances and “fictive” qualities of the medium, the actors attempt to alienate the viewer from any passive acceptance and enjoyment of the play as mere “entertainment”. Instead, the goal is to force viewers into a critical, analytical frame of mind that serves to disabuse them of the notion that what they are watching is necessarily an inviolable, self-contained narrative. This effect of making the familiar strange serves a didactic function insofar as it aims to teach the viewer not to take the style and content for granted, since (proponents argue) the theatrical medium itself is highly constructed and contingent upon many cultural and economic conditions.”
“Disclosing and making obvious the manipulative contrivances” may not be Wes Anderson’s obvious aim, but the fact that his films are so readily categorised and broken down may at least hint that the estrangement effect is in place. And what are the politics of The Grand Budapest Hotel? It concerns two fringe identities in the face of encroaching fascism.
It is in this way that Grand Budapest is tidily packaged in that thematic dichotomy can be found in the visual aesthetic, and the two feed back into one and other: The rose-tint of nostalgia against the cultural trauma of fascism.
It can seem counter-intuitive, when one of the major criticisms levied against Anderson’s films is that they hide lack of substance behind beautiful aesthetics. But if we consider that the opposite may be true, can the lush aesthetics of The Grand Budapest Hotel, especially during the aesthetic rug-pull of the tawdry 1968 hotel, be hiding its politics precisely within its visuals? The set designs of Grand Budapest Hotel took inspiration from ski resorts rendered in photochrom, a method of colouring black and white photography by hand. They appear stunning in their subtle pastel palettes. But at the same time, the colours they claim to represent are entirely fabricated- left to the artistic choices of the colourist. The hyperreality throughout The Grand Budapest Hotel reminds us that all is not what it seems, and the centering of characters who would have been sidelined by fascism and other historical oppressions serves to challenge our romanticised notions of pre-war Europe.
Which brings us back to the box. The shape of the box in which the Grand Budapest Hotel plays out literally changes shape throughout the movie. Within, it helps guide us through jumps between time periods, but outside of the box, the changing shape serves to remind us that it is the box that we are watching. That this is a fictionalised, romanticised and nostalgic rendition of a far different reality. I think, if you’ve been willing to follow me this far, the characteristic Wes Anderson visuals and irreverent humour do credit to this film. They make the film appear beautiful and whimsical, but in doing so, challenge the viewer to contemplate what parts of a story remain too painful to tell, what has recollection- and history in turn- brushed outside of the frame?

We exited Szimpla Kert and stepped out into the dark, rustic alleys of Budapest. The fragrant fall air of late October brought hints of change, and this once-ruined city at night gave the impression we were traveling in another world.
While walking the streets in that state of traveler’s bliss, we joked about the twists of fate that had brought the two of us to this place, still buzzing on the beers we had shared in a vintage bathtub in the maze that was the ruin bar we had just left.
As we passed through the alley, a figure moving against the crowd was nonchalantly listing out choice substances to no one in particular, not-so-subtly soliciting interest.
The indulgences of the night had lulled me to let my guard down, and so I thought nothing of her flagging the guy down in the crowded street, and inquiring about the availability of some grass. There were two of us, and just this one man, so what risk was there?
As they conducted a transaction in hushed words, I felt no cause for alarm. My friend was confident in these kinds of situations and…

Hi there! Maeghan & Oli here - we're taking a break to travel the world and hope you'll join us for the ride. 🌏✈️ 👫 www.alittledetour.ca

We’re not going to lie, Maeghan was a little upset to learn that the Grand Budapest Hotel didn’t exist in real life…. but with everything that we heard about Budapest, she felt optimistic with the our next destination.
Budapest was fantastic. We walked around most days exploring the city and eating great food. There were so many different craft beer bars and bottles shops, this is the first time we didn’t have a chance to hit them all! Budapest was also super popular with stag parties and student travellers — I guess it is just that time of year.
We also hit a snag when we had our first encounter with bed bugs in our Airbnb downtown. But our skills as backpackers has reached a new level of awesome and we had identified the problem, found a new place, packed our bags and were out of there in under 15 minutes.
Other than that, we loved it here so much, we decided to extend our stay not once, but twice 😊
See more on our website www.alittledetour.ca🌏✈️👫
On our second day in Budapest. Maeghan was sitting on the couch journaling and Oli was on his computer researching. We decided to switch places so we could recharge our devices and Olivier went on a hunt to find another power outlet. He looked behind the couch and noticed a tiny little bug on the wall in the living room…. it looked kind of like a bed bug…
So he grabbed a spoon, put the little guy in a glass and started a fine eye search to see if there was more. Well… there was.
Olivier found a dozen or so dead bed bug bodies (or a high confidence they were after looking at Google) and put them on a paper towel. Maeghan called the Airbnb host to ask him about this.. since Olivier kept finding more and more bodies and the skins of the bugs inbetween all the crevases of the couch.
Our host said they had bed bugs a few weeks ago, but had the exterminator come twice.. and not to worry unless we found a living one… and we did..
So within 15 minutes… we had their bags packed, space cleaned and they were ready to peace — with success. No bed bugs were carried and they found a new nicer Airbnb all in the nick of time!
The 2nd largest thermal pools in the world next to Iceland. We hope to visit both!
We saw this and thought of all our PasswordBox friends❤️. Ping Pong was an intense sport in the office, we had two and there would always be tournaments.. or two co-workers battling it out. But this seems like a new level of ping pong!
Ruin bar. Made in the ruins of an old building and furnished with only 2nd hand things. Also, has 18 bars in the one location — so you can go to the wine bar, gin bar, craft beer bar… etc. The best place for any group party!

It was so interesting to read your experience of Budapest. It has been a long time since I visited that beautiful city. It has a special place in my heart because my parents grew up there.

This article is a postscript to a previous article I wrote about how Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel uses a timeline of cinematic technology and formatting to differentiate nesting framing devices. Hinted at but slightly outside of the scope of that article was Anderson’s use of theatrical techniques. Specifically- in echoing Brecht’s Epic Theatre. The Grand Budapest Hotel deals directly with fascism, so it seems worthwhile to compare the Marxist and antifascist underpinnings of Brecht’s technique, with the ways Wes Anderson succeeds (and fails) to employ them.
One of the primary goals for the establishment of the Frankfurt School was to interrogate why the German Revolution of 1918 ended the way it did. How did the birthplace of Karl Marx find itself at the end of a political upheaval turning to the allures of capitalism, and ultimately, fascism?
Bertolt Brecht’s Epic Theatre is one of a number of artistic forms which attempted to side-step the motivations of capitalism and to speak directly to his audience. I am no Brecht scholar, and a lot of nuance will be glossed over in this article, however put as simply as possible Epic Theatre employed a range of techniques aimed to snap their audience back into reality. And where were they really? They were in a theatre, watching a play.
Brecht thought that by refusing to let his audience suspend their disbelief, he could force them to engage with the ideas and values of his play, rather than getting lost in investment in the character’s emotional journeys. Brecht was a Marxist, and the ideas and values his plays contained were often specifically anti-capitalist ones. Some thinkers of the Frankfurt School further theorised on these techniques, which we’ll talk about later in this article.
“I find Bertolt Brecht’s epic form, only out of focus, muddied by the bourgeois values of the neoliberal era.” says G.D. Brown of Wes Anderson’s most recent film The French Dispatch in a fairly incendiary Popmatters Article.
No matter Wes’ personal politics, his work is forged in neoliberalism. No matter how artistically successful any viewer may find his works, it is the box office that decides whether Wes Anderson keeps making movies. Furthermore, if he does aspire to the same revolutionary art which forged the Brechtian aesthetic, it is not apparent from his subject matter, nor his frequent brand collaborations.
“It is hardly a wonder that Anderson has directed commercials for SoftBank and American Express, for the likes of Stella Artois, Prada, H&M, AT&T, Hyundai, and Sony. His highly-stylized advertisements have connected common products and the arms of finance to sophisticated notions of film as elevated art, to visual reassurances of certain standards of taste and cultured cool. Of course, Anderson is not the first director of artistic merit to commercialize his talents. Supper won’t pay for itself.” G.D. Brown, Life After Brecht: Wes Anderson’s Lowbrow Dialectics
For Brown, the neoliberalism of Anderson’s aesthetic is rotten to its core: Its themes of minority identity under fascism function as appeals to the comfort of modernity rather than provocative calls to action. Indeed, the communists in Grand Budapest are just as hostile and threatening to the film's protagonists as the fascists (whether the communists depicted in Grand Budapest represent anything like actual communism is outside of the scope of this article.)
“In Brecht’s plays, his cues leading audiences away from the naturalist immersion of storytelling and toward the theater as an unreal portrayal (his breaking the fourth wall, his narrators and movements into song, and so on) were meant to prod the viewer into meaningful engagement with their own historical circumstances…
Anderson has faced criticism for his portrayal of largely white, upper-class characters in contrast with the roles of workers and people of color. As the viewer becomes aware of Anderson’s on-screen values, they must, like Brecht, take on the dialectical mindset to best understand the infusion of revolutionary form and bourgeois content, placing Anderson in the context of the neoliberal turn of the last half of the 20th Century.”
— G.D. Brown, Life After Brecht: Wes Anderson’s Lowbrow Dialectics
The accusation- for those who find this style exhausting (and I’m aware my writing often falls into this style)- is that Wes Anderson uses the stylings of revolutionary art, which is real and important. However, he uses them as a hollow appropriation. Anderson (though not necessarily through conscious intention) is packaging up the Brecht’s technique the same way he packages up other high-brow aesthetics (fine art, high fashion), resulting in an easily digestible remedy for intellectual and class anxiety.
An excellent quote from Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello’s The New Spirit of Capitalism, (which I pilfered from an also great Broey Deschanel video) spells out the process by which contemporary capitalism consumes and repackages revolutionary ideas, saying:
“To maintain its powers of attraction, capitalism therefore has to draw upon resources external to it, beliefs which, at a given moment in time, possess considerable powers of persuasion, striking ideologies, even when they are considered hostile to it.”
— Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello, The New Spirit of Capitalism
Conversely, it could be argued that this form of neoliberal media is the necessary conduit to deliver revolutionary ideas to a mainstream audience. In The Andersonian Theatricality by Irene Kalesi, Anderson’s use of humour is explored as a cloak through which to smuggle critique and revolutionary ideas. Having made the link to Brechtian technique, Kalesi writes:
Comedy when used accurately can be the harshest judge of situations and the greatest fighter for change. Jones points out that “comedy is a vehicle for subtly (or not so subtly) addressing these injustices by mocking the social norms in the hope of slowly changing the masses’ beliefs about the inequalities”. Therefore, the employment of comedy can be pointed towards parodying and thus criticizing war and the collapse of the social ideals. The comedic atmosphere helps the audience engage with the film’s sensitive topic, namely a story that takes place during a tumultuous historical period. This bittersweet story needs the comedic perspective in order to avoid being an overly emotional burden on the viewer. The power of theatre is that it helps the audience not to identify with a character per se but it makes them contemplate deeply about the events happening on stage. According to Aristophanes, serious matters should be touched by the genre of comedy. As Dicaepolis from “Acharnians” says: “Comedy too can sometimes discern what is right. I shall not please but I shall say what is true”. Therefore, the power of comedy is to reveal truths and centralize issues that concern the spectators.
— Irene Kalesi, The Andersonian Theatricality
In Marxist theory, praxis is the putting of theory into action: it can be used to emphasise the importance of engagement and activity toward a common goal, without dismissing the importance of theory.
So does Wes Anderson’s work, specifically The Grand Budapest Hotel, hold up to the criticisms of the Frankfurt School aestheticians who created the groundwork for understanding Brecht’s epic theatre? I’m not uniquely qualified to tell you. But we can try to chase the logic down together: Writing specifically about Brecht, Walter Benjamin wrote:
“The task of epic theatre, Brecht believes, is not so much to develop actions as to represent conditions. But ‘represent’ does not here signify ‘reproduce’ in the sense used by the theoreticians of Naturalism. Rather, the first point at issue is to uncover those conditions. (One could just as well say: to make them strange.) This uncovering (making strange, alienating) of conditions is brought about by processes being interrupted.”
— Walter Benjamin, Understanding Brecht
And furthermore:
“Epic theatre casts doubt upon the notion that theatre is entertainment. It shakes the social validity of theatre-as-entertainment by robbing it of its function within the capitalist system. It also threatens the privileges of the critics. These privileges are based on the technical expertise which enables the critic to make certain observations about productions and performances. The criteria he applies in making his observations are only very rarely within his own control; he seldom worries about this, but relies upon ‘theatre aesthetics’ in the details of which nobody is particularly interested. If, however, the aesthetic of the theatre ceases to remain in the background, if its forum is the audience and its criterion is no longer the effect registered by the nervous system of single individuals but the degree to which the mass of spectators becomes a coherent whole, then the critic as he is constituted today is no longer ahead of that mass but actually finds himself far behind it.”
— Walter Benjamin, Understanding Brecht
This leaves us at somewhat of a junction in considering Anderson. Is the Andersonian Aesthetic a reproduction of these ‘theatre aesthetics’, or does the use of theatrical technique and aesthetic in a cinematic context alienate the viewer from more conservative cinematic techniques? I think your opinions about neoliberalism may define where you sit.
If all revolutionary aesthetics are consumed and repackaged under capitalism, is praxis in media possible? Herbert Marcuse, another thinker of the Frankfurt School, was slightly more optimistic.
“It seems that art as art expresses a truth, an experience, a necessity which, although not in the domain of radical praxis, are nevertheless essential components of revolution”
— Herbert Marcuse, The Aesthetic Dimension
Marcuse took it one step further than Benjamin in that he believed it was the authentic artistic experience that anyone could encounter the thirst for revolution and come to sympathise with the failings of capitalism. Whether Wes Anderson’s art hits even this bar for authenticity is again up to personal judgment.
That capitalism will, in time, homogenise all cinematic aesthetics into a sort of grey sludge seems inevitable. You can see it happen in real time. But hangers-on like Wes Anderson, who thrive in a space that is alternative if only by degrees- these artists may well be the first glimpse of real art many filmgoers experience. Can intellectually honest ideas be mined from these works? This writer believes that even if they can’t, you ought to look.

Dear Margaret,
I traveled home to Hungary several times since I moved to France, the last time we met. I always just ran through the city to catch my connection to my home town and never stopped by to embrace the beauty of it again. Since you moved abroad too, there was nothing to keep me here for longer.
This time, it was different. My boyfriend came with me and I started to look at the streets we used to walk distinctly — like I’ve never seen them before, like an actual tourist.
At first glance, it seemed like everything remained the same — your favorite art nouveau buildings, the century old parks, historical squares… If only those walls could talk!
Yet, everything seemed changed. It’s been only 4 years since we said our goodbye here but it feels like decades have passed.
I took my boyfriend to the Danube river, or as we call it in Hungarian: Duna, for a stroll taking advantage of the last warm days of summer. I never noticed before how green our capital is, did you Margaret? I don’t recall if we ever talked about it.

We arrived in Budapest after traveling for twenty-two hours. We were tired.
My husband and I were new to river cruising and decided to get our feet wet with what some call the grand-daddy of Viking cruises — The Grand European Tour.
This cruise would take us from Budapest to Amsterdam over two weeks on the Danube, Main, and Rhine Rivers through the heart of Europe. We had no idea what to expect on our first night.
Before dinner, I asked if my husband could walk through Budapest with me across the famous Chain Bridge. I knew he was tired, but for me — he said yes. I had explained that we’d be departing the next evening before the city was lit and I wanted to get some photographs.
I’m blessed with an adoring and amenable husband. He knows one of my life’s greatest pleasures is taking photographs—especially on a trip.
When we left the ship, we weren’t ready for the beauty of Budapest at night. This walk over the Chain Bridge from Pest to Buda, on that first night, is one of my favorite and most beautiful parts of our European river cruise vacation.

When I was younger, single with not many cares in this world, I traveled quite a bit. I still do but it’s different now.
I was fortunate to work for a company based near Bristol, England. Once or twice a year I would travel to our corporate offices for meetings and/or training. Lucky me!
I would almost always take advantage of being overseas and book my vacations from there. Inexpensive flights to European cities made it a no-brainer.
One of the trips I took was to Budapest. I was quite spoiled as I acquired hotel points that allowed me to stay in hotels I would not have otherwise been able to afford.
Like the Marriott right on the Vltava River overlooking the Chain Bridge and Castle Hill. This was the view from my room.
I spent five or so days wandering around. For three of those days, a co-worker friend flew over and met me. It was nice to have someone to hang out with for a few days.

The more we observe a city, the more apparent it becomes that it surpasses the sum of its parts. It resembles a colossal, intricate organism with its network of organs and unique internal dynamics. These dynamics are a tapestry woven from our daily interactions within the city: the bustling morning and evening rush on the tram or subway lines and leisurely strolls along the riverbank — it all contributes to this vibrant tapestry.
Though it sounds idyllic, it stands worlds apart from the vast data streams of corporations, the omnipresent data visualization tools, the ongoing buzz about artificial intelligence across various platforms, or even the fundamental essence of artistic expression — music.
“Melody of Budapest,” sponsored by Telekom Hungary, aims to bridge these divides by transforming the city’s dynamic mobility patterns into a musical piece using data science and AI. Initially, Janosov and the data team of Telekom Hungary processed large-scale cell tower-based mobility data at a resolution of 100m into digestible information. This unpublished data covers the temporal and spatial specifics of every mobile phone event on Telekom’s network in Budapest, Hungary, from June 2022 to 2023, linked to their…

Recently, I was on a river cruise through the Lower Danube on AmaWaterways with Christian (TellMeWhyTravel). The stops along the way included Budapest, Hungary, Bratislava, Slovakia, Durnstein, Salzburg, and Vienna, Austria. All of the cities are known for its historical importance from war, due to their strategic location on the river, to arts and culture, where some of the greatest minds which ever existed created. However, by the time you’ve gotten to this page, you already know about Mozart, the Hungarian Parliament, Buda Castle, and the other tourist attractions your tour guide will show you. As our tour guide YOLO (Yes! That’s his name!) said, “Do you see ABC? ABC, another bloody church, additional broken castle.” While I can respect the art and architecture, and the blood, sweat, and tears that went into the churches, castles, and monuments of the era, once I’ve seen one (or two) I’ve kind of seen them all. (There are definitely some cool churches and castles but that’s for a different story!)
I’m going to take you off the beaten path and show you some of the art and culture of today in these cities. Today’s obscure artists will be the Mozart’s, Picasso’s, and Spielberg’s of tomorrow. The Internet has brought most of the things to our homes but art is something we must experience in person!
If you’re staying at the Aria next to the Church of St. Stephen, you’re in a good place to start.
Most of the museums are within walking distance between 1–3 miles and you’ll get to see the other landmarks of Budapest along the way!
So let’s get started!
Want to check out some contemporary art museums further up?
Both of these museums looked pretty cool, unfortunately the Q was temporarily closed for installation.
If you’re already tired or didn’t see anything interesting you can check out the Széchenyi Thermal Bath, which features 18 pools and saunas but also has an exciting retro architecture, which reminded me of high school.
But maybe you’re not done yet. Walk down past the ruin bars to the Palace District.
Have a drink or two here, usually you’ll find some live music, poetry reading, or lively conversation!
From here there are a few advanced options:
About 25 minutes away is the Ludwig Museum, related to the Mumok in Vienna. It’s worth seeing some of the collection which includes Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, and Joseph Beuys.
Cross the bridge and at the base of Gellért-hegy Jubileumi park is Faur Zsófi Gallery. We hiked to the top of it, but the park is still undergoing renovations but a stunning view nonetheless.
Also closeby is the music venue A38, where we were lucky enough to see the band Henge.
Not tired yet? Cross the chain bridge and get to the Buda side of the city.
In the oldest part of the city, Obuda, stands a shrine to one of the city’s most famous contemporary artists, Victor Vasarely, the father of the optical art movement.
Then cross back over to Pest and hit Kalman Maklary Fine Arts an interesting contemporary gallery (no exhibitions this year yet) which is close to parliament and a short stroll from the Aria.
If you happen to come in mid October, check out Art Market Budapest which is also near the first round of galleries near the opera house and the Aria.
Now if you didn’t finish all of that in your two day pre-cruise, don’t worry, you’ll have a chance to come back at the end of the cruise!
Sailing
The Slovak National Gallery is close to where the ship docks.
Three options for the outskirts of the city; I don’t think you can walk here, you might need to take a taxi, bike, or public transportation.
Rudavskys Magic Garden: The garden is closed for the winter, but looks incredible when it’s warmer!
The Július Koller Society
Tranzit
Danubiana Meulensteen Art Museum: This looks like a very cool museum atop a peninsula jutting into the Danube. I didn’t see it from the ship, but along with its sculpture park, it seems like an awesome place to check out the latest contemporary art!
Sailing
The next stop is in the Wachau Valley, specifically Durnstein. While Durnstein is a quiet town with not much contemporary art, 8km from Durnstein is a small cosmopolitan town, Krems an der Donau, with some interesting art options.
The map is zoomed out to show the proximity to Durnstein where the ship is docked.
Sailing
The following day we docked and took about a 90 minute bus ride to the quaint city of Salzburg, known for being the birthplace of Mozart. It’s also known for being the backdrop to the 1960’s classic The Sound of Music.
The city is surrounded by a steep rock face which made it an impenetrable during times of war. However, the top of mountain is a contemporary art museum. You get natural and manmade art from the top of the elevator ride!
But before we get there, global gallery Thaddaeus Ropac has two locations in Salzburg! Check to see if there are exhibitions at the farther one near the train station before you trek up there.
Finally, Galerie HAAS & GSCHWANDTNER is moving from its downtown location to somewhere else within Salzburg. Check their website to see where they end up!
Sailing
We made it! Vienna, Austria the largest, most cosmopolitan city on the Danube. The art scene here is huge with tons of galleries, museums, and history.
We will try to avoid the two most famous artists from Austria, Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt, because the Neue Gallery on 86th and 5th in New York houses Ronald Lauder’s huge collection of Austrian art including Klimt’s Lady in Gold.
The bus to old city will drop you about 5 minutes northeast of St. Stephen’s Cathedral.
There are a lot of galleries in the first district, here’s the east side of the city first.
The west side is next, the order is assuming that you are coming from the bus drop off location
On the east side of the outer museum loop
There are a few major art fairs that take place in Vienna:
March: Spark Art Fair
May: Affordable Art Fair
September: Vienna Contemporary and Curated By
November: Vienna Art Week
Austrian artists that I didn’t get a chance to see:
Stefan Eins: He stopped by my Times Square exhibition multiple times and had some crazy stories about when he started Fashion Moda in the South Bronx in the 80s.
Andre Heller: Multi-hyphenate who commissioned Luna Luna
Helmut Lang: the famed photographer
Franz West: Sculptor and artist
On the outskirts of the city is the Essl Museum, which houses what is considered the most important collection of Austrian art after 1945.
From here the ship sails back to the beginning port, Budapest.
Did we miss something? Drop a comment and we’ll be sure to check it out next time and let you know how it was.
Interested in recreating this experience? (You’ll now have the maps to save time instead of us stumbling around)
Here’s the link to the AmaWaterways cruise and the Aria hotel, which is voted the best in Central Europe consistently!
NB: There was an issue with Google Maps acting weird so instead of wasting time figuring it out, I made different maps for each art “district” in Budapest and Vienna.

Budapest is one of my favourite cities. Had an absolutely delightful day here. I would even chuck in a few of my other blog buzz words including “beautiful”, “lovely” and “ absolutely amazing”.
What better way to start the day. I had booked a tour which could have up to 8 guests and showed up at Central Market Hall. It was $145 which was a massive stretch but honestly why not. This is an incredible building inspired by the Eiffel Tower. The Hungarian government built four of these across the city in the 1870’s after all the open air markets got infested with cockroaches and snow for most of the year.
To my incredible fortune, the mysterious Mr & Mrs Chapelle from the US were both unwell and unable to attend. Private tour baby! With portions made for 4! I steeled myself for feeling like a spoiled baby.
I now also felt no concern in asking Orsha to photograph me as her happy customer.
Over the four hours and 12 spots I was reminded just why I love food tours. The history of a people is in their food. It explains their culture, customs and sends you directly into every family’s dinner table. Hungarian food also happens to perfectly correlate with my food preferences. We are talking:
I will now give you the rundown in several loose listicle paragraphs.
Market foods were first up.
This is their street food. A donut covered in garlic juice, sour cream and a mild cheddar. How could this not be delicious.
Next up we had the salami. I tried types called horse, curly haired pig, pork cheese (has all the different bits of the animal as different cubes) and Hungarian winter. Horse weirdly tasted how I thought it would. A wild earthy flavour that made me think of riding horses.
Some of the interesting things we saw in the market include a tonne of foie gras- Hungary is one the worlds largest producers- a tonne of fat and a delicacy of a whole chicken with an egg still in it.
A benefit of being on this tour alone was that Orsha had to field all my questions. She was likely unprepared for the grilling that arrived. Some facts for you:
The pickle tasting. That is right. The Hungarians are super into pickles. I was led down several alleys to the pickle basement. Cordoned off due to its offensive fragrance. She was concerned I might not like the smell. As an amateur pickler and somebody that has hosted an actual pickle party she couldn’t have worried more pointlessly.
Enter Marika, my hero. Handmaking pickles in the basement for over 50 years.
I got to choose my very own pickle selection and try them out. Easily the best I have ever had. My favourites were the kraut and the mini watermelons.
When I get back I am going to flat out not stop until I have prepared a pickle jar with a smile on it. Look forward to Christmas presents everybody as I think a month of unemployment should just about do it.
Also coincidentally I screenshotted this yesterday. I will just leave it here.
You know what else the Hungarians are into? Deliciousness. Lunch was this sausage and goulash place. Served with oodles of cabbage and horseradish. Divine. Followed by some iced coffee and cake that I ate before taking a picture of. It started with one forkful, then quickly snowballed until both slices were gobbled up.
I learnt a bit more historical stuff from Orsha too. Something I noticed as soon as I got off the train was how decrepit all the old buildings were. I asked Orsha what was up with that.
Basically what happened was that the Hungarians sided with Germany in both world wars. Hence they had massive damage in WW2 from gunfire and allied bombing.
After WW2 Hungary lost heaps of its land and was handed to the Soviets. After that they were largely communist. The soviets converted all the rich aristocratic houses into social housing and didn’t bother to repair them for 50 years. Hence the damage on these houses is genuinely from WW2.
There was also a large wall discovered from the original Budapest boundaries recently that we strolled past.
The strangest part of the whole thing was the final portion of the tour. Wine and cheese tasting with an actual sommelier in a huge cellar. I must say this was certainly not designed for one person, and certainly not a wine noob such as myself. I laughed and sipped and enjoyed desert wine with blue cheese as I nodded along to my very own personal wine lecture. A glorious combination.
My personal sommelier had not much to say to me after I requested to try some non alcoholic wines. I was having too much fun at this time and asked him all about what he thought about them. He said simply that it was a disgrace and “grape juice”. Oh Gregor. Keep pouring em.
I strolled home after this, quite drunk and somehow lost an earring. A perfect day really. Topped up off with such a heavy nap that I fell asleep on my sunglasses and hairbrush.
Loving it here. Really coming into its own this whole “Europe” thing. The further east we are getting the more I am loving it which is promising. The fast pace is also a nice change that is making time go very fast.
Today was just great. I very clearly need to do more food tours as it is just about my favourite experience a human can have. Tired but loved today.

I’m well aware that we don’t all rewatch films at the same time. We are all subject to individual whims that diverge and intersect largely at random. That said, I do think that in the near future many of us will be rewatching Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel.
This prediction is based on several factors: the impending release of Anderson’s new film The Phoenician Scheme, a renewed (or perhaps wholly original) fondness for Ralph Fiennes following his performance in Conclave, and the general critical consensus that The Grand Budapest Hotel represents the culmination of Anderson’s artistic vision. Essentially, if we’re due for a Wes Anderson rewatch, this will be the film a good 75–80% of participants will pick.
It’s my belief that when people do return to it, they’ll find the same thing I found during my recent rewatch. It’s better now than it was the first time. Why? Because time is a flat circle and our moral dilemmas have a habit of resurfacing in new disguises.
Viewers noted from the film’s release that one of its key themes was the rise of fascism. What I think we lacked in 2014 was an understanding of fascism as a recurring threat rather than one that was just as much an article of the past as the Grand Budapest itself. Sure, we could link the film’s commentary on the treatment of immigrants to ongoing crises in the world, but we didn’t see fascist militaries boarding trains and demanding visas. We saw… logistical challenges.
This political inattentiveness at the time of the film’s release contributed to a chronic misinterpretation of the two protagonists. Primarily, critics were prone to forgetting there were, in fact, two protagonists.
Readers may have noticed my use of the pronoun “we” up to this point when making my points. The “we” I am referring to are fellow white beneficiaries of the imperial core. To those reading who do not fit into that category, my apologies, but you’ll see the utility in a moment.
Our greatest failing when initially addressing The Grand Budapest Hotel at the time of its release, was to center our attentions almost entirely on M. Gustave for analysis. He is by all means a fascinating character with many aspects to pick apart and discuss; however, his function in the narrative is to serve as a catalyst and foil for our true central character, Zero.
The Grand Budapest Hotel is presented in layers, a trick Anderson has become quite fond of if his more recent film Asteroid City is any indication. The film opens on a young girl reading a book next to the grave of the book’s author, who awaits us in the next layer to detail a story from his youth, where in the next layer he meets with the aging proprietor of a hotel far past its prime situated in the fictional alpine nation of Zubrowka, and in the final layer where most of the film takes place, the proprietor recounts his time as a lobby boy at the hotel. By all accounts, the narrator and arbiter of style for most of the film is Zero (or at least the image of Zero his older self conveys to the author).
Like many of Anderson’s films, this one concerns itself with nostalgia for bygone eras. This nostalgia textures the memory of previous times to such a degree that they become more of a fantastical setting than a true reflection of the past, putting a pair of rose-tinted glasses on for the audience. Against the backdrop of a pastel 1930s Europe, we’re confronted with a group of characters who deliberately clash with it. While the staff of The Grand Budapest and the other members of the Society of Crossed Keys all stand out with vivid color, they are contrasted by the setting’s rising fascist movement dressed entirely in monochrome.
A common criticism I’ve found of Anderson’s work is that he prioritizes style over substance, that his chief concern is the aesthetic coherence of an auteur rather than the merit of his narratives. While in some cases this may be fair, what my rewatch of The Grand Budapest Hotel illustrated for me is that to measure style against substance is to create a false dichotomy. That is because, in this film style elucidates substance, substance that in 2014 we were perhaps less primed to recognize.
The rosiness of The Grand Budapest’s past and the whimsical absurdity of its inhabitants are the product of Zero’s recollection, because at this point in his life the hotel may as well be a fairyland compared to what came before. We learn later in the film, following a frustrated outburst from Gustave that gives way to a host of xenophobic insults, that Zero came to Zubrowka from an unnamed Arab country going through a state of political turmoil. He fled after witnessing the execution of his entire family and the lingering threat from the encroaching fascist army will mean death for him, should they choose to deport him.
While most reviews of the film at its release were positive, the few notable criticisms were leveled against the plot, some saying it felt nonsensical and unconnected to any broader theme. And when you view the film with Gustave as its true protagonist, the criticism makes sense. However, when you consider the film from Zero’s perspective, there’s an obvious logic as to why he would focus on patently silly events and madcap drama. To him, these are the good times. Times when he had his mentor and wife with him, when the fascists were a distant presence that only occasionally menaced him, and he had a home that filled him with a sense of purpose. This is the story he wishes to tell.
In the narrative layer where he speaks with the author, the now dilapidated Grand Budapest is the last vestige of that former life Zero still possesses. He explains that he maintains it not in memory of Gustave, who embodied the hotel’s spirit and ultimately bequeathed it to him, but in memory of his wife Agatha. This was the place they were happy together, however short that time may have been. The utility of memory is such that by sharing it we allow ourselves to be better understood.
We made the mistake of assuming fascism was included in the movie to emphasize that theme of memory, that is was a thing of the past that poked a hole in an otherwise happy period, but we also presumed that the only associations with it that mattered are our own. It is easier for us to relate to Gustave, because like him, our confrontations with fascist oppression are taken on by choice. Even with the added context that some of us, like Gustave, are queer and have that as a potential target on our backs, our existences are not constantly hounded by fascist dogma in the same way those of immigrants and refugees are.
While Zero’s growth over the course of the film is defined by him establishing himself as an integral part of the Grand Budapest’s community, Gustave’s arc centers his developing awareness of his own privilege and the value of his relationships with others. He comes to understand that there are ways to relate to others beyond providing a service.
The scene that I find most striking ten years later is a scene shot entirely in monochrome. It is an echo of an earlier scene and an escalation of the film’s color language. The fascist army boards the train and enters the train car occupied by Gustave, Zero, and Zero’s wife Agatha. They request the travelers’ papers, though this time with a heavier threat hanging over their heads should they produce the wrong kind of papers. Zero pulls out a wrinkled and ripped work visa, which Gustave confirms the legitimacy of and even produces a card from a commander in the fascist army indicating they should be allowed to pass. The fascist army members do not accept this. And Gustave, as the author is told by an older Zero, gave his life trying to ensure Zero’s safe passage. What precisely happened to Zero and Agatha in the two years between Gustave’s death and the death of Agatha and her child is left ambiguous, but one can presume they were not happy times.
It is easy for things to become commonplace which would have been unthinkable just a few years prior. We now live in a version of the US confident in its power to harass, detain, and deport immigrants on a whim. We have people boarding our trains and asking for our documents at this very moment. What The Grand Budapest Hotel wants us to realize is that we have a duty to the person sitting next to us. It can be easy to allow injustices to pass us by due to relative distance, to cling to a veneer of civility and not make a fuss.
Perhaps the most insidious misinterpretation of the film is that Gustave is a good man because of his civility, that his politeness brings him karmic rewards because he does not discriminate in who he is polite to. The aforementioned scene refutes this assertion, bookmarked in black and white so the audience takes care to remember. Gustave was a good man because he knew when to take action, and he gained that knowledge through his friendship with Zero. If his strength is his civility, then true civility must include a refusal to sit by and allow harm to come to the people around you.
The Grand Budapest Hotel is a better film now in 2025 than it was at release, because present political circumstances make it far more difficult for us to miss the point. Zero was always the heart of the story, his attachment to the hotel always in relation to how it provided a home for him rather than a vocation. It is only now that we begin to develop the consciousness to understand these things outside of our own privileged experience. It is no longer possible to ignore.
We feel the weight of the world of memory Anderson presents more keenly now because we have lost the benefit of distance from the time it represents.

There is a certain pattern I notice in cities all over Europe that is both unique and also interesting. If there is a huge shopping mall either as part of the complex or in the immediate vicinity of the main railway station of an urban area, that particular city has a lot to offer to its visitors. In the case of Poznań, it is no different either.
On the surface, the city on the River Warta is one of Poland’s largest urban conurbations, a hub of education, and an important business center. However, once you scratch the surface, the city becomes significantly more than another bustling metropolis. Poznań is home to a plethora of historic and cultural references.
Amid the many modern buildings and high-rise apartments, the city also showcases an eclectic mix of Baroque, Gothic and neoclassical architecture. There are many Budynek zabytkowy (listed buildings) and Pomnik historii (historic monuments) scattered around in the city, the ownership of which comes with certain obligations and restrictions.
On second thoughts, I believe a major shopping mall attached to the main station complex in…

Reading scripts. Absolutely critical to learn the craft of screenwriting. The focus of this weekly series is a deep structural and thematic analysis of each script we read. Our daily schedule:
Monday: Scene-By-Scene BreakdownTuesday: Major Plot PointsWednesday: SequencesThursday: Psychological JourneyFriday: Takeaways
Today: Major Plot Points.
In every scene, something happens. A plot point is a scene or group of scenes in which something major happens, an event that impacts the narrative causing it to turn in a new direction.
A relevant anecdote. Years ago, I was on the phone with a writer discussing a script project. My son Will, who was about four years old at the time, must have been listening to me talking about “plot points” during the conversation because after I hung up, he asked, “Daddy, what’s a plop point?”
That’s in effect what a plot point is. It’s an event that ‘plops’ into the narrative and changes its course. So when you think Plot Point, think Plop Point!
The value of this exercise:
* To identify the backbone of the story structure.
* To examine each major plot point and see how it is effective as an individual event.
* To analyze the major plot points in aggregate to determine why they work together as the central plot.
This week: The Grand Budapest Hotel. You may download the script — free and legal — here: The Grand Budapest Hotel.
Screenplay by Wes Anderson, story by Wes Anderson & Hugo Guinness, inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig
IMDb plot summary: The adventures of Gustave H, a legendary concierge at a famous hotel from the fictional Republic of Zubrowka between the first and second World Wars, and Zero Moustafa, the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend.
Writing Exercise: Go through the scene-by-scene breakdown of The Grand Budapest Hotel and identify the major plot points. Post your thoughts in comments and we’ll see if we can come up with a consensus.
For Part 1, to read the Scene-By-Scene Breakdown created by Rob Hoskins, go here.
Tomorrow we consider the script’s structure in terms of its sequences.
If you’d like a PDF of The Grand Budapest Hotel, script scene-by-scene breakdown, go here.
Major kudos to Rob Hoskins for doing this week’s breakdown.
Tomorrow: We focus on the sequences in the script.
This series started here and we have 26 volunteers to do scene-by-scene breakdowns of contemporary movie scripts. The scripts we have already analyzed are in italics.

Ever wondered how to draw a map of less common geographical areas? And color them based on some data? This pair of tutorials shows how to build this from scratch! First, you need to construct the border of your polygons — Part 1 is about this task. After that you need to create a map, and color those polygons according to some value of your interest. That will be shown in Part 2.
Part 1 of this tutorial is available here.
There are many tutorials on the internet for drawing maps in Python, even more sophisticated maps like heatmaps (where heat is basically the density of points in an area) or choropleth maps (where polygons are colored according to some arbitrary value). However, these tutorials are mainly done on states of the United States. View some great ones with plot.ly or an also otherwise superb one with folium. For the US, these packages have some convenience methods, but for the rest of the world, they’re of little use. Alternatively, they are based on some accidentally available json file like this one with Altair. Obviously, these are not general solutions to the problem of creating a map of some areas of your choice. I aim to give a general solution in these articles.
In this second part you will:
The code is also available on GitHub:
github.com
A GeoJson is actually a JSON file with some predetermined structure. The function above generates a GeoJSON file from a list of points by JSON dumping a dictionary formatted like a GeoJSON file. In these dictionaries, there are only 3 keys: lat, lon and name. Lat and lon stand for the coordinates, while name identifies the shape that the point belongs to. The order of these dictionaries in the list is also critical, you can read about this in the first part of this tutorial.
GeoDataFrames are a subclass of classic `pandas` DataFrames with a special column. This special column, geometry contains all the information that makes this DataFrame geo-aware. A GeoDataFrame object can be easily created from a GeoJSON file, you can add additional data to polygons easily, and just as easily convert it back to a GeoJSON file for visualization purposes.
In this snippet to the left centroids are added to each polygon. By this, we can add a nice marker to the centroid’s location depicting information about the polygon - in this case, the district. Just as easily as this, other data can be added using a plain pandas merge. Here, income tax per capita data is added to each polygon!
The creation of the map consists of 4 important steps:
Firstly, map creation is just as easy as it seems. You should provide a starting position, a starting zoom, and a tiles argument which is responsible for the basic design of your map. Be aware, that folium expects coordinates in latitude, longitude order!
Secondly, creating the choropleth is also easy, but it requires a neatly structured GeoJSON file. The parameters of the choropleth method speak for themselves, but you can refer to the documentation if something is not clear. This creates a layer where polygons are colored according to income tax per capita data — the more the greener, the less the yellower.
Thirdly, A FeatureGroup object is created. This object consist of Marker objects signalling each district’s name and the respective income tax per capita value to give the reader exact amounts apart from the color coding from choropleth. Lastly, LayerControl is added to the map in order to make it possible to show or hide layers, such as the choropleth or the FeatureGroup layer.
Finally, the map can be saved and the created .html file opened using your browser. You can find it on my github, in the outputs folder, but here is a snippet of it:
The main takeaway here is that in creating a beautiful choropleth map — just like in any data science project — data preparation takes around 90% of the effort. We got to know OpenStreetMap data structures and the Overpass API, and solved an interesting problem in Part 1. In Part 2, using GeoDataFrames made it easier to add information to our GeoJSON files and maps. It is also clear for me, that if you are creating maps in Python, folium is the way to go. As you can see, creating a map can be a one-liner, and creating choropleth maps or showing markers with html popups are really easy with folium.

I knew so much, when I was living in Budapest thirty years ago. And not only a lot more Hungarian than I know today.
I knew about the national poet and revolutionary Sándor Petöfi and about playwright and author Ferenc Molnár, after whom I name the fictitious Molnár Club in Birds of Passage. I still know a bit about them, and you may know of them, too.
In 1990 I was hearing a lot of talk in our Budapest social circle about the poet and playwright János Pilinszki, who had died about 10 years earlier and was still revered. He would definitely be on my fictional playwright Gábor’s mind.
And back then I knew about Gyula Krúdy, too; I’d even seen the acclaimed 1972 Zoltán Huszárik film Szindbád based on his work. I liked the idea that down-and-out Kalliopé – my favourite character in the novel – would think so longingly of the bone soup that figures in the film.
But I’d forgotten all about Pilinszki and Krúdy by the time I was rereading Birds of Passage this spring. Their names had become as foreign to me as they may be to you. I had to Google them to figure out why I’d included them in the novel, what they add to the characterization of Gábor and Kalliopé, and how I wanted to create a sense of the Budapest cultural milieu of the time.
I had no great hopes for Birds of Passage when I was writing it, and it had become too close to me for me to see it clearly when I finished it. I was thrilled when Karen Haughian of Signature Editions (then Nuage) wanted to publish it in 1993, and surprised when the review copies she sent out included one to the Times Literary Supplement.
And I did get lots of reviews, even as an unknown and unheralded writer.
The Globe and Mail was reviewing first novels in those days, CBC Radio discussed them on air, and publications like Books in Canada (now defunct) published thoughtful pieces unimaginable today — and paid the reviewers small but useful sums for doing so. I was the cover story in Hour magazine, also long-defunct, and I was interviewed by Shelagh Rogers.
Publishing a novel is nerve-wracking, and publicising a first novel is like having ball lightning in your kitchen. The work you have been obsessing over for years is out in the world – and being read by people you know and people you don’t know. They all have opinions of it, and some will tell you what they think, and who knows what they’ll say? Most will say little, if they say anything at all, and there’s no way of knowing if that’s even worse.
And then there’ll be the reviews – and far more people will read those than ever read your book.
An awful lot depends on reviews, which is the main reason for lamenting how few there now are.
I read the reviews of Birds of Passage with trepidation and astonishment.
The Globe’s was among the first:“Leith handles emotional crisis adroitly, without being clichéd. Her prose style is observant, quick and spare.” That was okay, pretty good, really.
Speaking on “The Arts Tonight” on CBC Radio, author Antanas Sileika praised the book in extravagant terms: “If you like Milan Kundera, if you like Vaclav Havel, you’re going to love this novel.”
Books in Canada described my novel as “remarkable” and published a long and thoughtful review article:
“Because Birds of Passage is a very sophisticated book, the title cuts many ways. The various birds that inhabit apartments, tunnels, mines, and nests enrich the story without intruding on it: suggestions of freedom and confinement, of beauty and fragility, rise naturally into the narrative. Moreover, because Gabor is a writer, Leith is able to comment playfully on her own creation. The novel’s ending seemed a touch contrived, but in a book of such varied delights this is a very small quibble. Leith has the gifts of a natural storyteller.”
The Times Literary Supplement took its time (its review appeared in 1994), but was well worth the wait:
“Hungary 1990 — with dissident lives redundant after the defeat of Communism, market prices making beggars of the population and foreign feminism knocking rudely at the door — is the setting for this excellent first novel. Birds of Passage explores the tenuous relationship between a Canadian couple and their Hungarian neighbours. Linda Leith is perceptive and never sentimental about the role Hungary plays in the lives of the Canadians, Alice and Daniel.
“Across the street from them, the playwright, Gabor, a romantic, who has mostly escaped reality by living the cloak-and-dagger existence of an underground political activist, cannot settle down to domestic responsibility; his apartment is full of sparrows trapped by the closed windows.
“Leith is good on the claustrophobic, old-fashioned feel of Central Europe, with its male heroes, its sacred places and works of art which artificially perpetuate a culture shut off from the international mainstream. Hungarian men in particular are so well adapted to the cage that when released they can barely survive. Alice, who has a strong character and appalling clothes sense, is impressive. Leith has that cool, precise way with the passions that makes one think of Alison Lurie.”
I had read only one book by Alison Lurie, whom The New York Times described as a “tart-voiced novelist of manners.” I didn’t see Birds of Passage as a novel of manners, but I was delighted with my allegedly “cool, precise way with the passions.”
TLS reviews were unsigned back then, and I did wish (and I still wish) I knew who had written this. Whoever it had clearly made the acquaintance of one or two Central European men.
I also wish I’d written to these and other reviewers to tell them how much I appreciated their comments on my book. I was a novice, and I didn’t know I could do that.
Getting a great review is one of the joys of becoming a writer – but then I got a letter from an outraged Hungarian émigrée who didn’t like my book at all.
This woman sang the praises of her homeland — and heartily wished that Birds of Passage had done the same. She deplored characters in my novel that she found unsavoury, including dear Kalliopé — and protested I’d sold Hungary short.
I didn’t agree then, and I don’t agree now, for a novel is not a travel brochure, and Alison Lurie is hardly the only novelist who can be tart-voiced. As Mavis Gallant once put it, “No writer calls a truce.”
But I am grateful to this woman for her letter. Hers was the response to Birds of Passage that did most to convince me I’d done my job as a novelist.

Hansje van Halem gave an amazing and very inspiring lecture during the 8th edition of Graphifest in the Design Terminal on 11 November 2014. After her talk she was so kind and answered my questions.
It’s always good to meet a person who is so passionate and enthusiastic when it comes to talking about his/her job. Dutch graphic and book designer Hansje van Halem, who has studied at Gerrit Rietveld Academy and has been working as a freelancer since graduation, is such a person. She used to hate typography because of the rules, but since she can work freely and do experiments she introduces their wonderful creations to the world regularly.
First of all, thank you for your lecture, it was really great. You have mentioned a lot of things regarding your career so I would be interested in the beginnings now. How and when did you first meet design? Did you actually want to be a designer when you were a child?One of my first memories thinking about my future can be dated back to when I was around 8 years. It was when we were taught how to draw perspective by using a ruler; we drew lines that looked endless. I remember making those drawings and thinking: I would like to have a job where I could use a ruler. I have realised now that I have a job for which I can use a ruler as it’s about measuring and calculation.
I also remember, at some point being ten or eleven, I wanted to be a theatre or movie director. I think that also makes sense because I should make a lot of decisions and to do a lot of processing.
It also has to be mentioned that both of my parents are artists so I grew up in an environment where my father had his studio next to our house and my mother had her atelier inside the house. So I was always surrounded by people making stuff and by material and equipment. I didn’t grow up like going to museums all the time but I did grow up in an environment where if I had an idea it was okay to cut and make something. I also remember begging my father: I had a huge stack of paper, and I would beg my father if he could put it under my mother’s sewing machine. It had to be sewed in the middle, and then I folded and filled the book. Additionally, as a kid, I loved the typewriter, I used it to create books.
You also said that you hated typography, however, the Netherlands is famous for type design and letters, so I’m wondering how it was possible.I started art school when I was 19 or 20; I went to a really formal one where they said: “These are the rules, this is how you should do it. When you do it differently, you do it wrong.” Moreover, I was a kid of an artist, my mother was also a teacher in a different art school, and I knew that art/design is always about pushing boundaries, looking for differences in things. At my school they didn’t teach this way of designing, it was all about rules, and in order to do a good job you had to live up to them.
Personally, I was too afraid, I knew if I made an S, then it had to be according to the rules. Then I changed school and went to this more Bauhaus type of working with teachers like Experimental Jetset, (Good)Will Holder, Jop van Bennekom and Gerard Unger. They were all so secure of their own work, that they easily gave space to their students. They would not give you an assignment like “create an S”, but said like “do a project with numbers”. I could just loose my imagination into looking at their systems. In addition to that, I could also find the space to experiment and to find out what’s right or wrong on my own without having a teacher saying this is right and this is wrong.
Do you think education is necessary, I mean does one have to go to school to be a good graphic designer?Of course, there are people who don’t have education, but I don’t know how anyone could afford not to spend four years full-time with so many professionals dedicated to this specific topic. You can learn so much, and you can have such a great time. If you do it on your own with a job on aside, I don’t think you get this level of knowledge and practice. I wouldn’t be a graphic designer without education, as I couldn’t have learnt so much in such a short time. Of course, you learn more after school than during school but that’s not the same.
You have also mentioned that you have your studio in your apartment. Do you think it’s a good idea to have a studio in one’s home?I forgot to tell… I worked from my student room in 2003–2004. It started to feel really weird when I started to have clients over. Sometimes they would leave late to get the work finished and there would be only a short period of time between the moment when the client left and the moment when I got undressed to go to sleep. Time to get some studio space!
After having a studio for a couple of years I was fed up and moved my work space back into my (now bigger) house in 2009. That was a very productive period of two years. I took in an intern and started a gallery space in my living room showcase cabinet. But when I was sitting on the edge of my bed having dinner, I realised I needed my house back. Again, I started looking for a studio in 2011, and now I have a really nice one about 15 minutes away from my house. It’s good to have a start and a finish every day even if the day takes very long. It’s also nice that when I come home there isn’t a room full of sketches.
Do you work alone or sometimes within a group maybe?I work alone. Sometimes I need help but this is always on different levels. If I’m busy and some correction rounds need to be done regarding a book I know somebody who is more precise than I am so I just hire her. But I do everything alone basically. One of my wishes for my next life is to be a designer duo because it’s kind of lonely sometimes.
How many projects do you usually work on at the same time? I assume creating a book it’s a great amount of work.Oh, yes. It can be zero projects so I make my own stuff but it can be 5 or 7 projects at the same time. Of course, they don’t have the deadline all at once because it would be impossible to complete all the tasks, so it has to be one project starting, one waiting for reply, etc. I think I do my best when I have multiple things do to because otherwise I would start to make a big deal out of making decisions.
I’m just curious, do you use a calendar or do you know all the deadlines by heart?I keep many of them in my head, I usually know that I have a deadline next week.
How many projects are you working on right now?I am in some kind of troubles this week as I’m not working here. I’m getting a solo exhibition in Eindhoven; I’m making a spin-off of my publication, it will be 48 pages instead of 484 and it will be cheaper as well.
Yesterday I was in a supermarket in Budapest, and the printer called me and said: “We are running out of time. I’m afraid we are not gonna make it.” I was like “I’m in Budapest, I cannot do anything”. So it was a bit stressful. I was invited to design a fence for a company in Holland, which is a different thing, it’s working with material. I’m doing a poster design for a gallery located in Northern Holland. In fact, I just finished it last week, but I know there is a next one so I’ve started experimenting. This is something I do for free and I really enjoy. They always give me nice reviews. Of course, in between I make a diploma for students, and I’m working on logos for some individuals. So there are lot of stuff going on…
You work a lot. Can you stop working at some point? I’m asking because you’ve also said during your lecture that you do repetitious work in your free time.Yes, but I love watching TV as well. For the first 5 years I was working non-stop, later I realised there’ll always be work so it’s okay to take a break, it’s very normal to have weekends. There was a short period during the crisis when I was getting less money so I could not hire people and I was working during weekends, but I’m back on track now.
And finally, how do you like Budapest?For me it’s a cultural shock. I was just getting on the plane as it was taking a train to another city in Holland but getting out of the plane I had to realise this is not Holland. I didn’t really have time to think about being here, though. Today I was walking around, and first you go to the tourist layer and looking all the windows, but then I was taken to the House of Terror, which, of course, changes perspectives. You get the contrast between all the beautiful, decorated ceilings you could see in the buildings and this horrible history… And you meet nice people as well. I’ve been here for 30 hours maybe so I cannot say so much but it’s very intriguing.
You should come back later on!I’m going to treat my mother on a weeklong holiday in Budapest. I’m just thinking of stuff what we should do.
By the way, do you know anything about Hungarian graphic design?Only what I’ve seen on Graphifest, and, of course, I’be been looking around in the city as for graphic design it’s very important to get a platform, a space to show design. I’m just wondering what the operation spaces of Hungarian designers are.
They usually open a studio…Yes, but I mean in the street. I’ve seen posters but I don’t think those are designed by those people. Maybe different types of agencies…
There is an exhibition called ARC that has a theme every year, for instance.Yes, but for me exhibitions are designs for designers, however, designers should also meet clients who will hire them. Right now my problem is who will hire me, I might be invited to more exhibitions than for work. It’s lovely that people appreciate what you are doing and want to hang and show your work to other people but you need to make a living as well.
Do you think it should be offline, I’m just wondering, because you can be hired based on your portfolio on Behance/website, for example?I think your work should be everywhere. I’m on Cargo Collective because it has a gallery system so every time I do something I can put them in the front row. I get clients from there, and also from Instagram.
I don’t know how people did it before because when I graduated there was no Facebook or Tumblr, people did have websites but I have no idea how they did it. There were a lot of requests for portfolio books, though. There was always a book being published, and an art director called you that he/she wanted you in that book. Exposure is very important. I also have friends and colleagues who have maximum exposures but no paid assignments. So they get invited to Japan, for example, but nobody calling them saying: “Hello, we have some money, can you create something for us?” It would be nice to be found by an agent or something. I can see on Instagram that an agency is following me and I’m thinking: Oh, interesting, maybe they want me.

Budapest is Hungary’s capital and largest city. It is by far the most visited city in the country, with millions of tourists landing every year. It also happens to be one of my most favorite cities. That being said, I am a traveler and not a tourist.
As such, every time I plan to travel, the idea is to go beyond the usual. In the case of Hungary, it is no different. Every occasion I venture out to this beautiful European country, I behave very unlike me. I make at least a couple of impromptu decisions during every vacation, and this attitude has helped me explore a lot of the country. This trip was no different.
For starters, on this occasion, I had not landed in Budapest and planned further. Instead, I was on my way to the hitherto unexplored western part of Hungary, having flown in to neighboring Austria. While I landed at Vienna, it was not going to be my base for the next few days. On the contrary, I had towards Sopron.
In the eight days that followed, I ended up exploring Sopron, Szombathely, Kőszeg and the surrounding countryside in the Győr-Moson-Sopron County and the Vas County. All the cities I ended up visiting also have a German name. So it is Ödenburg for Sopron…

They say there are two types of people in Budapest, those who live in Buda and those who want to live in Buda.
Well, after my first trip to this stunning city with my high school best friend, Kat, I can see why. Buda, with its rolling hills and picturesque skyline, is undeniably the prettier side of the Danube, but I quickly fell for both Buda and Pest.
There’s a certain magic to the way the two sides blend, separated by the wide, winding river but bound together by history and charm.
From the moment we arrived, we were swept up in Budapest’s grandeur. The architecture alone felt like it was trying to impress us. It succeeded. Every street corner seemed to shout, “Look at me! I’m outrageously elegant!” with good reason.
The city is a feast for the eyes, with its majestic buildings, intricate monuments, and statues that could rival those in any European capital.

Wes Anderson’s “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” released in 2014, is a cinematic masterpiece that defies categorization. With its distinctive visual style, quirky characters, and intricate narrative structure, the film takes audiences on a whimsical journey through a world that is both charmingly surreal and emotionally resonant. As a testament to Anderson’s unique directorial vision, “The Grand Budapest Hotel” has left an indelible mark on the world of cinema.
A Visual Delight
From the moment the film begins, viewers are enveloped in a visually enchanting universe that could only have sprung from the mind of Wes Anderson. The movie’s meticulously crafted set designs, intricate color palettes, and meticulously arranged compositions create a mesmerizing experience. The Grand Budapest Hotel itself, with its pink façade and ornate interiors, serves as both a central character and a metaphor for the film’s whimsical allure.
Anderson’s keen attention to detail extends beyond the set design. The use of miniatures and practical effects adds a layer of tangible magic to the story, transporting the audience to a realm that feels both nostalgic and otherworldly. Each frame is a work of art, and the film’s distinctive visual style is as much a character as any of the actors.
An Ensemble of Eccentric Characters
At the heart of “The Grand Budapest Hotel” is an ensemble cast that brings the film’s eccentric characters to life with remarkable depth and charisma. The inimitable Ralph Fiennes leads the pack as the charismatic and witty concierge, Monsieur Gustave H. His magnetic performance adds a layer of charm and complexity to the character, making him simultaneously hilarious and heartwarming.
The supporting cast is equally impressive, with memorable performances from Saoirse Ronan, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Tilda Swinton, Jeff Goldblum, and many others. Each character, no matter how minor, contributes to the film’s rich tapestry, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.
A Narrative Maze
What sets “The Grand Budapest Hotel” apart is its intricate narrative structure. The film unfolds as a story within a story within a story, skillfully weaving together different timelines and perspectives. This layered approach not only keeps the audience engaged but also deepens the emotional resonance of the film.
The narrative structure is further enhanced by the film’s playful tone and dark humor. Anderson effortlessly transitions between moments of slapstick comedy and poignant introspection, creating a balance that keeps the audience emotionally invested while never taking itself too seriously.
Themes of Nostalgia and Loss
Beneath the film’s whimsy and humor lies a profound exploration of themes such as nostalgia, loss, and the passage of time. Through the character of Zero Moustafa (played by F. Murray Abraham and Tony Revolori), the audience witnesses the changing landscape of Europe and the hotel’s decline from its glamorous heyday. This melancholic undercurrent adds depth to the film, reminding us that even the most fantastical worlds are not immune to the effects of time.
Conclusion
“The Grand Budapest Hotel” is a cinematic gem that continues to captivate audiences with its unique blend of visual artistry, quirky characters, and intricate storytelling. Wes Anderson’s directorial vision shines through in every frame, creating a world that feels simultaneously nostalgic and fresh. The film’s ability to evoke laughter, wonder, and introspection is a testament to its enduring appeal. As we revisit the charming corridors of the Grand Budapest Hotel, we are reminded that, in the world of cinema, true magic knows no bounds.

In Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel, the moments of absurdity are essential to understanding the humanity of the story and how our relationships with others are what defines our lives. Anderson is sure to never spend too long on one tragic moment alone and tends to bundle emotion, comedy, and danger together in a scene. These moments of comedy act as a device to distance the viewer from the dark realities of the story and are key to making the film enjoyable instead of altogether sad.
From the moment the film starts, we are distanced from the story. We see a young girl visit a tribute to the author of our tale, who then discusses the true story of his book as it was told to him by Zero in his later years. We are quickly aware of the lenses we are seeing the story through and the fact that it is a story. It is through the form of a story that we can pay attention to the greater themes that are discussed about the world and the relationships that develop.
When Gustave receives news of Madame D., he immediately heads off to the funeral, and abruptly takes Zero with him. “We must go to her.” “We must?” “She needs me, and I need you to help me with my bags and so on.” Although this is the way in which he asks Zero to go with him and has him pack wine and his bag for him, it becomes clear that Gustave wants to have someone by his side. Like Zero, Gustave is alone in this world and has no one else that he would trust to go with him. Gustave clearly feels a strong bond with Zero early on and treats him as a friend once they are outside the hotel, but Zero does not feel that same way immediately. Gustave pours him wine (which Zero does not drink) and plans that if things were to go south, they should run away together. Gustave even chooses Zero as his heir to his estate when he is gone. Zero is the closest thing that Gustave has to family and the hotel is the closest thing either of them has to a home. He admits to Zero (on Madame D’s death), “I blame myself. She tried to warn me…but I didn’t listen…There’s really no point to doing anything in life because it’s all gone in the blink of an eye.” This is a truly dreary perspective from Gustave that he counters with telling Zero how good she was in bed. They are then interrupted by the militiamen who enter the train and who Gustave tries to charm and joke with as he would with anyone else, to no avail. After they are assaulted when Zero’s papers are not in order, it is Gustave’s charm after all that saved them. Heckels telling Zero, “Your companion was very kind to me when I was just a lonely little boy,” showing Zero how, while his charms do not always work, Gustave can make a difference in people’s lives by treating them with care and respect. It is through their performance of careful care as hotel employees that they are both detached and closer than anyone else, and, by sharing this secret, Zero allows Gustave to be the closest thing to “real” that is possible.
When Gustave is arrested and in prison, he continues his role as concierge. Anderson highlights this role with the comedic lines of Gustave as he rolls his food cart past each of the cells, offering slop like it is fine cuisine; even salting it for a prisoner. He’s surrounded by hardened criminals and fighting, yet all he wants to do is make life as good for these people as he possibly can. He has Mendl’s smuggled in and shares it with his fellow prisoners, the group including Pinky who he got in an altercation with early on, the altercation itself showing that Gustave can break his act of charm when it suits him and that his desire for control is stronger than his facade. The group has even discussed that he’s “a real straight fellow,” and, “one of us now.” Gustave is delighted and surprised, as he is probably not thanked in the same way for his services in the hotel, as well as the fact that he is just treating the prisoners the way he would anyone else, likely seeing them in a very similar light, saying that even, “The most dreadful and unattractive person only needs to be loved and they will open up like a flower.” Living for the hotel and acting as a concierge are Gustave’s sole purposes in life and are why he does not let go of his duties even while behind bars, giving letters to Zero to read on his behalf to take care of the hotel the way that he would, even giving poems to recite just as he would to remind them that he and the hotel are one in the same. Gustave’s idea to have the digging tools smuggled in with the pastries, that the guard cannot bear to destroy, acts as a metaphor for the charms and kindness of Gustave being the only way to combat the brutishness and bad in the world.
When Gustave escapes through the sewer with the prisoners and meets with Zero, he is quite the opposite of his charming self and is in the shoes of the concierge as a boss and not as a companion. Zero has no disguises for them, no safe house and has not brought a bottle of l’air de panache for Gustave to freshen up with. While not essential to their plan, these things were all included in how Gustave would have done them himself had he been in control. This lack of authority in the moment and his distance from the hotel trigger him to go off on Zero. He condemns him for coming to Zubrowska as an immigrant, saying that if he does not know how to act that they’d be better off if he went back to where he came from. When Zero rebuts with the story of how his father and family were killed and how the violence of the war caused him to leave, Gustave realizes the error of his ways and apologizes, “On behalf of the hotel… Don’t make excuses for me. I owe you my life. You are my dear friend and protégé and I am very proud of you.” What seems to be a very low point of Gustave’s character has a sudden redemption arc when he realizes that these material things don’t matter at all if he hadn’t had Zero to help him. This is the turning point for Gustave seeing Zero as a friend or brother and the only relationship that truly matters to him. This moment is essential to the later scene where Gustave officiates Zero and Agatha’s wedding as well as Gustave’s final moments in the train car where all three have become a family and would fight for each other.
In all, The Grand Budapest Hotel acts as a tale of light within the darkness. It shows how stories of individuals and their relationships can make dire times appear much brighter. Anderson uses the bonds of Zero and Gustave, and later the addition of Agatha, to present a realistic portrayal of how life goes on when tragedy occurs and that all you can do is laugh and try to make the best of your situation. Anderson carefully weaves in the exaggeration of comedic situations and actions with the grim reality of Gustave being framed, people being murdered, and the government falling to a new regime in just a way that makes you think about what you’re watching and makes you question why you feel the way you do. Anderson’s narrative works because, before the viewer even realizes it, they are shown loyalty, love, war, and loss and are told to face it just as the characters are, head-on.

Wes Anderson’s ‘The Grand Budapest Hotel’ is well positioned to win some Oscars on Sunday. It received nine Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Picture. The film’s editing has received widespread praise and Editor Barney Pilling is nominated in that category (his first Oscar nomination). Pilling’s work on ‘Budapest’ also recently won him an ACE Eddie Award for Best Edited Feature, Comedy/Musical. Pilling’s past projects include ‘An Education,’ ‘Never Let Me Go,’ and ‘One Day.’ He’s currently working on ‘Suffragette’ starring Meryl Streep and Helena Bonham Carter.
Here’s our Q&A on ‘The Grand Budapest Hotel’:
What inspired you to become an editor?
I’ve always loved watching films throughout my life and I’ve always had a creative drive…but I’d have to say that the sci-fi and war films of my childhood really fired my imagination in a way that little else did and probably set the foundation for a life of make-believe. ‘Star Wars,’ Spielberg, ‘Bladerunner,’ ‘2001 A Space Odyssey,’ ‘Alien,’ ‘Guns of Navarone,’ ‘Where Eagles Dare,’ ‘Bridge on the River Kwai’ and so on.
What’s it like to work on a Wes Anderson film?
It’s incredibly hard work and truly exhilarating, all at the same time! It’s also a privilege for me to work with so many outstanding craftspeople and performers.
What were the biggest challenges with editing the film?
Probably pulling in so many elements from so many different sources, studios and countries for the action pieces. We had green screen main unit, miniature model and landscape builds in Berlin, stop motion puppetry happening in London, and Look FX tinkering away in LA — so pulling all this into focus with the right rhythm was a long and tough process. Also technically really demanding of the editorial team and the Avid Software — many, many video layers!
Both you and your wife are in the business. Do you discuss work at home?
Yes! Lots. It’s hard not too. You have to be very passionate about what you are doing to succeed in the TV and Film industry, so it’s difficult to switch it off at home. Also, we end up being first audiences of our respective projects — bouncing things off each other — it’s nice.
Could you see yourself working with Wes Anderson again?
I hope so! I’m incredibly proud of the work we all did on that ‘Grand Budapest Hotel’ and have become close friends with many of my fellow craftspeople. These are feelings and relationships that of course anyone would want to repeat or perpetuate.

I have been pretty inactive on social media in the past few weeks because my phone was stolen while I was traveling in Budapest, Hungary. Losing your phone is very inconvenient in this day and age, when so much activity and business has moved to mobile platforms. Not having Google maps in my palm made navigation a bit more cumbersome, and many of my plane tickets and travel information were on my phone. I also couldn’t look up different restaurants to go and compare the reviews. Worst of all, I was cut off from the rest of the world as I couldn’t access my emails, texts, phone calls, social media, etc.
My first impression of Budapest was very positive. I liked how traditional Budapest is compared to other big cities in Europe, and the Hungarian culture is alive and thriving in this city. Many of the restaurants were over a hundred years old, serving traditional Hungarian cuisine the same way they had for centuries. There was a wide variety of meats, including goose, venison (deer meat), wild boar, duck, rabbit, etc., which I really appreciated because those types of meats are relatively rare in America and Western Europe, where people usually just eat chicken, beef, or pork for their protein. Moreover, prices in general were a lot lower in Budapest, although the exchange rate was pretty confusing because 1 US dollar is almost 300 Hungarian Forints (289.22 as of July 14, 2019). I…

October has always been my favorite month, filled with happiness, and fun, and began of the festival. But this October, we planned to do something different, So We decided to take our vacation to Budapest. We did not take a single vacation break this year which made us do something different, to feel like we did something this year apart from work or regular life.
Budapest the capital city of Hungary, is a town rich with history, beautiful breathtaking architecture, and unforgettable experiences.
But this trip was different from any other trip we had before because we ticked off one of the most thrilling items on our bucket list: skydiving.
I’ve always been drawn to the idea of flying, but nothing could prepare me for the rush of actually leaping from a plane at 10,000 feet. The sensation was beyond words. Budapest, with its stunning landscapes, became the perfect backdrop for…

We were awakened in the middle of the night on our European River Cruise by a loud noise, a shaking of the boat from left to right and back to left again, and the closet light flashing on and off as the door spontaneously opened and banged shut.
“What was that?” I asked my husband as I grabbed his arm. He looked out our glassed-in French Balcony. “We’re in a lock,” he said. “The boat must have hit the side of it.”
Within minutes, we were back to sleep. We had our safety drill early in the trip and no sirens went off nor was any announcement made — whatever it was, lock or no lock, we were safe.
When we planned our vacation traversing Europe on three iconic rivers — the Danube, Rhine, and Main — we had no idea we’d pass through so many locks.

Wes Anderson’s “The Grand Budapest Hotel” is colorful, quirky and almost surreal.
Behind Anderson’s detailed world is Marquette alumnus Adam Stockhausen, Comm ‘95.
Director Wes Anderson and Stockhausen looked at old hotels and other eastern European buildings to create the invented country of Zubrowka.
“The Grand Budapest Hotel” received nine Oscar nominations and won four of them.
Stockhausen took home his first Oscar for production design. He shares this award with set designer Anna Pinnock.
m.jsonline.com
He graduated from Marquette in 1995 with a degree in theater.
“He has that ability to wrap his mind around stuff and to get so engrossed in things that it really turns out some wonderful stuff,” Marquette Theatre Artistic director Debra Krajec told Fox6 News.
Stockhausen is the first Marquette graduate to win an Academy Award since Dom Ameche won for Best Supporting Actor in 1986.
Stochkausen was previously nominated for his work in the 2012 film “12 Years a Slave.” He has already worked on two films since “The Grand Budapest Hotel.”

The city smelled of days’ worn clothes. Streets are littered with piss stains, cigarette butts and small piles of dog shit. Budapest features a rich history, the majesty of time immemorial is written into ornate buildings riddled with bullet holes, and in somber pockmarked faces of passerbys. Ambulances in a foreign language squeal in the distance, like a whining dog. Trams charge up and murmur in electric tongues. Dark-haired people with thin lips and absent eyes mix into the landscape.
I get the sense of an underlying hardship, that people are struggling (later confirmed by talking with locals). Maybe it’s winter malady, absent of snow and joy. The only people laughing loudly are the tourists, who are everywhere; Flaunting their unburdened spirit, unbridled by work or school or obligations (here on holiday for cheap thrills). To walk down the sidewalk is to island hop between unrecognizable dialects. You know a tourist by: Loud chittering dispersed amid large flocks with cocked heads; raised eyes and abrupt stops to review digital maps; movement that is too fast or slow for the pace of the street.
I’m not sure what I was looking for in my trip, and I wouldn’t say that I’ve “learned about myself” or “grown” per se. I would like to continue streaking away from a traditional career in America; I want to let go of the rope on the bunny slope. I don’t desire being different as a matter of course, but simply following others is not the way towards individuation.
I do seek: Authenticity. As Dōgen, a Japanese Buddhist priest, writer, poet, philosopher, and founder of the Sōtō school of Zen in Japan, said, “We study the self to forget the self. When you forget the self, you can become one with the ten thousand things.” And as the Buddah proclaimed, “kill the Buddah.” Or, your ultimate goal is to make your own way. Guides, inspiration, models offer signposts, but the landscape is vast and inherently unique for each person; I intend to get off the trail, even if I need to come back and follow the blazes from time to time.
Towards the end of his life, Carl Jung stated that our greatest adventure today is in the exploration of our unconscious. Everything else is a distraction; to know ourselves is more important, meaningful, and challenging than say, colonizing Mars — while I appreciate the pursuit it seems more like an act of running away from the real meaning here on Earth (and from within ourselves).
In the Western world, we live in a culture of (inter-)connection in the form of: sociability and social networks; emails and Twitter streams; a prizing of extraversion; boredom and distraction. And yet loneliness is both ubiquitous and a condemnation. Jung would classify this as the Shadow of our collective Ego, because consciousness exists for individuals and societies, and we are very good at denying ourselves and each other at scale. To deny your Self is to empower the Shadow, which is the root for maladies of the human personality.
Tidying things up: In a world with excess information most of us are sponges, super-saturated with no spare volume for our own understanding… what would happen if we were all suddenly wrung dry?
AARON GERRY tries not to take himself too seriously, despite what the content may suggest. He enjoys pen and paper, perambulating, and donuts. Many donuts. Oh and writing. Speaking of which, his work can be found in journals and publications such as Chronogram, Lit Up, P.S. I Love You, The Creative Cafe, The Junction, and others. If you like this piece please do 👏clap👏 along!

A book that made me book a flight to Budapest. I guess it was one of the best decisions. Right now, crying here in “Vinikli” while enjoying Hungarian wine, still feeling so happy that I am here. Thank you Magda Szabó.
Oh, my heart. This book is why I’m sitting here in Budapest, crying my eyes out as I read the final pages. What a story… my heart is shattered into pieces. My dear Etelka. My dear Iza.
My journey with Hungarian literature began with Sándor Márai’s Portraits of a Marriage, which remains one of my favorite books. But this one, written by the talented Magda Szabó, is just as incredible. Reading the final pages in the very place where it all unfolded is truly a magical experience.
In Etelka, I saw so much of my own mother, and in the things Iza did thinking she was helping her mother, but slowly, unintentionally causing her to wither like a flower, I unfortunately found myself in her.
After my family lost their first child, perhaps because I am the only child my family had later in life, I empathized with the book deeply — I’m not sure — but it touched me profoundly. I felt an incredible sense of regret for every time I was unsympathetic toward my mother. At the same time, just like Etelka, Iza’s life was also changed, and I can truly relate to the turmoil and confusion she went…

Budapest is the capital and this was my second time here. This time the stay was in Hotel Danubius Helia at the Karpat Utca, on the banks of river Danubius. You get a view of Margaret island from the hotel rooms. I visited the island on the Day 1 evening, people usually go there for jogging, having alcohol at the restaurant, watching the ruins. There is also a presedved bio diversity, a few animals kept in there covered from all sides.
I took a walking tour on the second day and they take you through: the Parliament, American Embassy, Heroes square, Ruin Bars, the Jewish synagogue
Its a very small country in the Central Europe, part of which also meets the Adriatic Sea in the south. Almost any part can be reached in a couple of hours from the capital: Ljubljana. If compared, the country must be smaller than Indian state Madhya Pradesh.
Unlike rest of the European countries, the capital doesn’t have Tram trains and Subways as public transport. You can only use the local buses. In fact if you’re a tourist, every tourist spot can be covered by walk. Its all within a square kilometer from the main bus station. Preseren Square, Ljubljana castle, Dragon Bridge, National & University Library, Restaurants, Market are the only places that can be visited or are a must visit. You won’t find Starbucks, Subway, KFC et cetera here in the capital. Luckily, we have McD, Pizza Hut, at least for the Vegetarians.
25 minutes of walk to the castle, mostly climbing, you get a very beautiful view of the city from the top. There are multiple entries and exits at the bottom where you can start your climbing. You can also take a Funicular railway for a return ticket of 6 Euros, to avoid walking. I preferred walking because thats what I’ve been doing since last 6 days perhaps to save a few Euros for the remaining tour. I’ve started liking to walk (a lot) now a days. You’ll see a bunch of private restaurants, pretty costly too, on the top part of the castle. This part, privatization at the world heritage sites, I really hate it.
Bled is a beautiful town 55 kimoleters away from the capital. Arriva is the transport company here which takes you there with a good frequency of buses, for every half an hour, charging 13 Euros for return. I had planned for only 1 day for Bled unknowing of its charm. One can spend like a week here if you plan to see it thoroughly. There’s a lake in the middle of the town with a small island which has a church. People usually take local ferries to reach there, the charge is 15 Euros for return. Its a wooden boat and the person ferrying us has to row using the oars in both hands, sounds like bit of a stamina work, right? To add to that, there were around 16 people on the boat.
Vintgar Klamm is a place from where you can start your walk through gorge, to the waterfall alongside the picturesque Radovna river. 2 Euros for a return ticket by bus from Bled and about 30 minutes to reach.
Its a beautiful walk with cold breezes and lushy green forest. You can also go near the water, drink it, sit there for some time unless you are making any risky move.
For solo travellers or not tourists, who do not want to spend a lot on stay, I would suggest booking Turn Hostel in Mala Ulica near the main bus station which is 5 minutes walking distance. They charge around 25 Euros per night plus 3 Euros environment tax. Also all tourist places in Ljubljana are at a walking distance.
After the beautiful trip of Slovenia, I then took a bus from the main bus station of Ljubljana to Marburg where I’ll be meeting my brother in law. It was a 17 hours of journey by Bus, I had booked a Flixbus through their app, it costed me 53 Euros. The bus was scheduled at 21:05.
The bus was a double decker Flixbus and it was running late by an hour as it had started from Zagreb. To my surprise, Buses in Europe run late too. I hadn’t booked a specific seat number, so boarded and searched for the best available seat for me on the upper half. It doesn’t matter to be seated in last seats in European countries as the roads and speed breakers are smooth enough. More importantly, buses are comparatively comfortable too. I got a window seat exactly above the rear tyre set. It was a semi sleeper and the journey was for the entire night. Phew!!
It reached on time to the Frankfurt bus station at around 9:00 am and I had a connecting bus at 11:00 am to Marburg. I walked in to a nearby hotel to enquire for using the washroom. 1 Euro was the charge. I quickly refreshed myself, enquired for the coffee at the reception but unfortunately they didn’t serve only coffee, I needed to take the entire buffet which I was not in the mood to. I decoded to take a walk around the bus station, it was a big place, with many shops, hotels, tram stations et cetera. I could even see an Indian restaurant across the road, but it would only open after I take my bus to Marburg.
“I don’t know where I’m going but I’m on my way”
Trip Route:
Mumbai — Vienna — Budapest — Ljubljana — Bled — Ljubljana— Marburg — Munich — Vienna — Mumbai

UPDATE: This is a fairly old article, since the 2015 instagram update various aspect ratios are allowed to upload, from 1.91:1 to 1:1 hooray for cinematographers and directors like Reed Morano or Emmanuel Lubezki. But that doesn’t mean this article is of no use, all the contrary, the quick lessons within still apply if you want to give that somewhat classic look to your instagram account, much better if you like the squared ratio photos, like many photographers of the minimalist style wave do.
Those who saw “The Grand Budapest Hotel” can agree with me that it was marvelous in many aspects: Oscar worthy direction, scenarios, music and many others. But for now, i’m writing about his cinematography/ photography direction by the hand of Robert D. Yeoman and how he and the movie can make you a better instagrammer.
When I just finished watching it for the first time, at the moment the credits were rolling I realized that the movie itself is, in a way, an awesome and inspiring example of Instagram photography.
The frames were composed with such taste and detail that the first thing I say to my friends about the movie is that “It’s visually incredible”; and perhaps, some part of that beauty it’s because of the unusual (almost squared) 1.37:1 aspect ratio used on most of the length of the film.
That unusual look gave the movie that 30's vintage film look that I found absolutely beautiful and, in fact, it’s very Instagram-like.
Note that Instagram uses a 1:1 Squared aspect ratio, not 1.37:1, but between 1.37:1 and 1:1 there isn’t a lot difference.
The following are some examples of the key aspects I was able to absorb from the movie.
The Grand Budapest Hotel teaches us that keeping in mind the frame when composing is the key, every line, every element and just about everything is in the tone and fits perfectly on his aspect ratio. (look at the courtains in the example or the columns in the first picture)
One of the primary reasons that most people post bad photos on Instagram is that they not compose their photos thinking “squared”, they aren’t thinking in 1:1 ratio, some people just take the pictures, as usual, in the aspect ratio the camera app is set (usually 2:3 or 16:9), forgetting the composition, and later they crop the photo in Instagram, well, that’s a mistake. Use an app like VSCO cam, the square guide feature within the app is meant for Instagram users, it helps a lot.
“Always think 1:1”
It’s all about giving your subject his space, the movie does this perfectly, sometimes with flat backgrounds, brighter backgrounds and not making the subject to absorb the entire frame.
Make it simple
Sometimes there will be a trashcan or a chair that will come out on your way, disbalancing your shot, and the best way to treat this is simply moving them away to have a better and cleaner composition. Or you can incorporate them to become a part of your shot, as I explain in the next point.
One thing I found curious, specially in this shot, is the fact that all the elements in the movie are in a certain position and place that it almost feels painted.
The movie with that single shot tells us a story, some kind of manhunt or investigation. Well, that’s what a great photo achieves, to make the public imagine the reason of every element on the shot.
Tell a story with your elements
Just arrange the objects to give balance to your shot. And as the example shot shows: A little dramatic light always help.
This is actually very trendy among the photography and design community, but i’m not aware of the name of the trend, if you know it please leave me a note →
This one is the key aspect to make your photos look like the work of a pro (while you become one). The movie gave special attention to achieve symmetry to their shots. Perhaps that’s the main aspect I loved about The Grand Budapest Hotel (visually speaking), and the reason that lead me to write this article.
Make your shot stable, be sure your camera is completely vertical or horizontal and look for guides to help you give symmetry to your shot (Look at how the black tiles at the example helps to center the shot.)
Take your time
I suggest not to tilt your photos. I’ve seen very few pics on Instagram that work with a tilted crooked angle, the 1:1 aspect ratio pairs better with a flat horizon line. So, unless you’re absolutely conviced that the tilted angle will work, try to avoid it.The symmetry is the best friend of the aspect I explain next.
This is the ultimate “cheat” to make your squared Instagram photos look awesome. The cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman without a doubt loves the perspectives and we have the joy to experience many scenes like this one in the movie. (Similar to the Stanley Kubrick style)
This style draws your attention into the picture, creates movement in it and, virtually commands you to pay attention to the subject.
Give movement to your shot
The lines are everything. Take the example shot as a simple guide. Corridors, bridges or train tracks are ideal scenarios; make your perspective lines go to the corners of the frame, make it symmetrical (as I explained in the previous point); put one main subject at the center of the frame (max two subjects); and simply enjoy the moment. You’ll see the results. Your photos are gonna get a lot of ❤ on Instagram.
Now it’s up to you. Watch the movie, get inspired, follow this path and start shooting, you’re gonna love all of it.
Please, don’t get me wrong, i’m not saying this is the only way to shine at Instagram, but it’s certainly a beautiful path.
Here are some real examples of successful instagrammers of this style, follow them for an extra dose of inspiration. I II III IV V (I love the third one)
Thank you for reading!
This is my very first article and if you recommend it that will mean a lot to me. Let me know if you liked it. ☺Apologies if something is misspelled, I’m not very fluent at english.Share this article wherever you like. Thanks.

Budapest’s Beautiful Lies: The Deceptive Booking That Left Me Sharing a Bathroom with Strangers,https://medium.com/@odettekuleba/budapests-beautiful-lies-the-deceptive-booking-that-left-me-sharing-a-bathroom-with-strangers-b0c56a49349e,"Sign up

Overwhelming, volatile, passionate, affectionate, dependable and adoring.
Her emotions, like a wild storm gathering on a calm horizon, erupt without warning, casting doubt on my capacity and worth as a parent.
Despite our frequent squabbles, my teenage daughter approached me in October with travel plans for Fall break that felt more like a polished closing argument in a presidential debate. She artfully outlined her reasons for the trip, highlighted how it could strengthen our bond, and delivered a persuasive appeal for me to step away from my relentless 9-to-5 grind — stirring a sense of intrigue and the promise of much-needed relaxation.
It left a mark that lingered in my thoughts, pulling me in until I finally gave in.
A few weeks later, we were soaring above the clouds, Budapest-bound, carried by the thrill of reconnecting with old friends.
We touched down just past midnight, stepping into Budapest’s deserted streets, where every shadow seemed to echo the 12 years, I once called this city home. Meanwhile, I rehearsed the apartment code like a sacred verse, fearing my dead phone would turn this arrival into a pilgrimage of memory.

It was her fifth new date in as many weeks, and none of them had been a success. The men all appeared very attractive and almost perfect matches on the screen of her mobile phone. In real life, however, there was always something a bit off. Sometimes more than a bit.
Tonight, it was Jeff. Jeff had potential. Definitely handsome. Probably hadn’t lied about his age. Casual – both his outfit and his demeanour. It turned out his “college education” was a few months of online courses at a community college that had since closed down. He studied international hospitality but gave up when the family business needed his help. He now runs an industrial carpet cleaning firm. Pet odour removal is their specialty.
She’d been wondering if Jeff had noticed that her blazer was not freshly pressed. She’d convinced herself it wasn’t visible. Just to be on the safe side, though, she removed it after the appetiser. This manoeuvre put her full breasts on clear display, barely concealed by the cream-coloured dress she had chosen for the occasion.
Twenty-nine years old, chief researcher at a major pharmaceutical company, she was wondering what had gone wrong. Why did she have to drag herself to dates with strangers instead of curling up on the sofa in her cosy living room – book in one hand and a cabernet sauvignon in the other? Perhaps her father had been right. “You might as well move into a monastery. Just as likely you’ll meet someone there as locked up in your place.”
Jeff ventured into talking about politics just as the main course arrived. He sounded like he had rehearsed what he was saying, but his views were moderate, and for the most part, she found his points reasonable. Then his phone rang. He fished it out of his pocket, looked at the screen, and excused himself. She kept staring in front of her while he was gone, without touching the salmon on her plate.
When he returned, he sat, ran his fingers through his hair, and fidgeted with his shiny, oversized wristwatch.
Then he said, “Have I told you your nails are done beautifully?”

It was my husband’s 45th birthday in November 1989, and we went out to lunch.
I never went out to lunch. András and I never went out to lunch. There simply was no time in his life or in mine for such luxuries, but we did have reasons to celebrate — and plans to make.
The Berlin Wall had been crumbling for months before it came down that November. András had been watching the news with uncommon interest, both professionally, as a political scientist, and personally, as a boy who became a refugee when he and his family fled Soviet tanks during the 1956 Uprising.
His life was now full of teaching at Concordia University and consulting work; mine was filled with teaching at John Abbott College, publishing Matrix magazine, and editing fiction mss. for Véhicule Press. Both our lives were brimming over with our marriage, our three sons, our big house, a yellow Labrador named Hector, and our writing and research; I’d just finished writing my book on Hugh MacLennan’s Two Solitudes.
András was going to be on sabbatical from May 1990, and I’d had good news about a research grant that would release me from teaching for the next three years. We were going to leave this busy life behind, pack up our children and Hector, a few books and other belongings, and spend the year in Budapest.
That was the plan. And that was the start of the Budapest of my imagination.
It did work out, in most ways, but there were unpleasant surprises, along the way. The nastiest was learning that the man who rented our house was a crook. The loveliest was the fairytale hillside villa we moved into in Budapest in June, 1990. The fact that we ended up living there for two years rather than one was hardly any surprise at all.
The most miraculous surprise, for me, was that I was able to write a novel in Hungary.
We returned to Montreal in the summer of 1992, and Birds of Passage was published by Signature Editions in 1993. It’s been out of print for years and now, in a process of rediscovery, I’ve begun to serialize it here and here.
My own rediscovery of that early book, certainly, as I hadn’t reread it for decades.
A rediscovery of the Budapest of that pivotal time, when the first post-communist government elected in Hungary in June 1990 stumbled into something close to anarchy.
And a rediscovery of the hope that fledgling government represented — a hope already being dashed in our first months in Hungary, and a hope that looks poignantly, tragically over-optimistic when viewed in the dark light of today’s Hungary and today’s world.
I’ve never been an expert on Hungary.
I was a foreigner there with a limited understanding of the language. I had been there several times before, though, starting in 1972, and had always been one of only a few foreigners there. I was in the privileged position of having close contact with András, who is an expert, and with many other Hungarians through his extended family and close friends who had been dissidents under the old regime.
And I had daily contact, in my halting Hungarian and my almost-forgotten German, seldom in French and English, with neighbours, my sons’ friends, shopkeepers, my language teachers, and a widening circle of Hungarian writers and artists.
At that November lunch in Montreal, I dreamed I might have time to write while we were in Budapest. And I did start writing almost immediately after we settled in, keeping a journal, taking notes, working on what I thought might be an essay.
Only then, sometime in October 1990, history caught my imagination, and I found myself writing dialogue, structuring a story, and creating characters. I kept going all the next year, telling no one what I was doing, hardly daring to hope this would become a novel.
I was doing my research work, too, and I was editing manuscripts and working remotely with Matrix co-editor Kenneth Radu, designer Susan Valyi, and business manager Diane Hibbard on upcoming issues of the magazine — and, as the months went on, putting together a special issue of stories, poems and images by the writers, translators and artists I was meeting in Hungary. The title of that issue is “The Budapest of the Imagination.”
The rediscovery of Birds of Passage is the rediscovery, for me, of a city I loved and once knew quite well, for a foreigner.
It’s the rediscovery, too, of the person I was then — I was 40 years old in 1990 – and the warily hopeful and bedazzled eyes through which I saw that city at a time when it was impossible to guess what the future had in store for its world-weary denizens, its avian populations, myself, or my family.
Like this new Hungary, my literary career was just a fledgling in 1990. Blue Metropolis was nowhere on the horizon. I had no way of knowing I would one day be a publisher of other writers’ books. And the reason I never told anyone I was writing a novel is that I was afraid it would never get published.
I present it now for readers interested in a great city living through a period of turmoil; for anyone curious about the process of becoming a writer; for those few who will notice how literary mores have evolved in the intervening decades; for everyone mesmerized, as I am, by the power of the imagination; and for amateur ornithologists everywhere.

One of the beauties of this platform is that it allows me to publish chapters of a novel that’s long been out of print and, in the process reread it and reconsider it.
There are practical considerations. I have neither a Word version of the novel now, nor even a pdf, so I’ve been scanning the printed book, chapter by chapter. I then copy and paste each chapter into a Word document. This results in countless glitches I then edit —for “to” has repeatedly become “ot,” to take just that example, and entire paragraphs moved to another page. So, I’m looking for glitches as I reread, trying to catch them all, and making a (very) few other changes necessitated by the passage of time.
I haven’t read the novel as a whole since it was published in 1993, but I’ve now posted 7 of the novel’s 18 chapters online. And it’s a discovery — and not only because I’d forgotten so much of what I wrote in Hungary.
The woman I was 30 years ago is in many ways a stranger to me, for a start. And, as chapter follows chapter, I’m learning things I never knew about writing, about becoming a writer, about putting myself in other people’s shoes, pink or otherwise, and about the connections between writing and pivotal moments in a history, a story, a life.
I’ve been taking notes, this spring, for a new book, when I have half an hour to do so. I’m usually too busy, as I was in 1990, to sit down and just write.
In those days I was in the throes — of wrapping up a semester of teaching, research, editing a new issue of Matrix magazine, preparing another fiction manuscript for publication by Véhicule Press, walking Hector, preparing meals, taking my sons to music class, swimming, pottery.
And today, I’m on a family holiday in a world at war, playing with my grandson Remy, running a publishing business online, planning a boat ride on the Thames, pondering the meaning of family — and writing at 5 a.m. instead of sleeping.
Writing, in my experience, has always been what gets done when I should be doing something else. So, one surprise about Birds of Passage is that it ever got written.
I had forgotten much about Gábor, and almost everything about Eszter, Tivadar, Rudi, even Alice. I do remember focussing a lot of attention on Alice, in particular, for I didn’t want anyone to mistake her for me. In those days the inclusion of autobiographical traits was a favourite cavil in reviews of first novels written by women.
So I’d forgotten how unlike me Alice is, and how comical she can be. I’m both amused and bemused by her curious dress sense, her hair, her nose, her obsessive running, her jumpiness, her outspokenness — and her early career as a photographer with the Royal Ulster Constabulary, of all places.
1990 was a time of change. Every time is a time of change, personally and politically, it’s always both. Like right now, for example.
If I knew that Birds of Passage was a novel about change, though, I had forgotten the extent to which Northern Ireland — and Quebec — figure in the novel, which I remembered as being focused single-mindedly on Budapest.
That city has remained vivid in my memory, but the vividness is unspecific, so I’ve felt jolts of recognition when details in the novel remind me of so much I had forgotten — including the nesting Russian dolls with images of successive Soviet leaders that were on sale in those days on the streets of Budapest.
If I knew that Birds of Passage was a novel about change — everything I write being about change — I had forgotten the extent to which it’s also a novel about home. And about being homeless.
About nationalism, different nationalisms — the nationalisms of Hungary, of Ireland, of Canada and Quebec — that are not so very different from one another, at least to an outsider. And not that different from the nationalisms that are tearing the world apart right now.
The novel is about family, too, a subject that now interests me greatly, surrounded by three generations of my own family, travelling with them, attending a family wedding.It’s about love, about those who are close to you.About foreigners, too, and the foreigners who are close to you.About movement and migration, refugees, exiles, displaced persons, and expatriates, which include those closest to you.About what matters, and how what matters coalesces at key moments in a history, or a life.
I already knew, 30 years ago, that those moments were key, even if I had no way of knowing what would follow, what new vistas they might open up.
I now know what the next three decades had in store for me personally, and I know a lot more about how the future would unfold for Hungary and Ireland, too, not to mention Quebec.
And I now know my first novel did in fact get published; that’s what I hoped for, of course, when I lived in Budapest, hoping against hope. And that, too, has become part of my story. Which means my first novel does end up being in some way autobiographical, in spite of all.
I know much less Hungarian today than I did back then, and I know much less today about the marvellous, complicated city I loved and then left in 1992; that loss is part of the story, too.
And part of my own story. As is revisiting the novel on this platform today.
So, in some ways I don’t understand, Birds of Passage looks forward to a future it could not know, almost as though poised upon a peak in Darien.

Where to go when visiting Budapest?
Sure, you may want to get a little lazy and relax in Szecheny Thermal Baths, or climb the Gellért Hill to have a glance over the nightly Budapest, having a beer (or the famous Hungarian white dessert Tokaji aszú wine) sitting just by the feet of the Liberty Statue, there is a booming music scene n Budapest. And guess what, definitely worth checking out!
Aurora — Toldi — Golya — Ambient — Beat on the Brat — Keret — Durer Kert — Tinta Art Cafe — Larm — Kék ló —
Yes, there are many. And this is not a closed list.
But, for one who loves going for the specific music, here is the list.
If you are into electronic music, Aurora, Ambient and Larm would be the best bets. With Larm going for a dance and more or less techno-club style, Ambient is a more laid-back bar with an audience slightly more inclined to enjoy the drinks, instead of dancing. Aurora is the most un-clubbish of all three, with community centre being at its core, fighting for social rights. Still, you can enjoy some pretty awesome music there on Friday and Saturday nights.
Toldi is another good choice to go for. In daytime a cafe and a (good) movie theatre, it turns into a nightclub when the sun goes down. Located just by the Basilica, it is a good choice for those willing to take a stroll around the city before going clubbing.
Aurora and Golya will take a lead on this, with Durer Kert and Kek Lo following. Both being places hosting a wide set of events, these event avenues are mostly bar-like, welcoming people enjoying all sorts of music styles.
If a true vintage sound is what you are going for, Beat on the Brat is the fool-proof shot. At times feeling ridiculously small, it is a spot for the vintage-obsessed folk to get together at. You can hear everything, from swing to 80s rock, and meet one-of-a-kind people here. Located in the very centre, it is a great place to check out on your way to Larm or other mainstream clubs.
Summer is about to open the doors and bringing down roofs to allow music out. Durer Kert, A38 and Valyo Kikoto are all about open air music. On top of this, make sure not to miss the month of Budapest`s green bridge being locked for locals to enjoy weekend nights on! This is another post though. Stay tuned and meanwhile check the best deals from CuddlyNest!

We started our European River Cruise on a Viking Longship in Budapest! What a great place to begin our trip than surrounded by magnificent buildings and iconic bridges.
Our boat was docked by the Liberty Bridge. This bridge was started in 1894 and finished in 1896 in time for the Millennium World Exhibition. It is the shortest of Budapest’s three bridges (source).
It was built in the art nouveau style and originally named the Francis Joseph Bridge after the emperor who ruled Hungary at the time (source).
We got a good look at the Liberty Bridge on our second day in Budapest when we finished wandering the city’s Market Hall. From the market, we walked straight towards the river and found the Pest entrance of the bridge before us.
“Both portals are decorated with the coat of arms of Hungary designed by Virgil Nagy and two Turul statues each. Turuls are falcon-like birds, prominent in ancient Hungarian mythology.” —…

Much has changed in the literary firmament in the decades since I wrote Birds of Passage in 1990, and one of the most significant changes is our awareness as readers today of issues of cultural appropriation and the appropriation of voice.
Do I have the right to put myself in Gábor’s position? In that of other Hungarian characters, like Tivadar, István, Rudi, Kalliope and Magda?
Or in those Daniel, Pierrette, even Peter?
Is it only Indigenous stories that are out of bounds to me, as a writer with no Indigenous ancestry?
Are the stories of Black people are out of bounds to me, too? That of Alice’s husband Daniel, who is from Goa? How about that of Peter, Alice and Daniel’s mixed-race son?
And what other stories should I not be telling, as a white Canadian woman born in Belfast?
Those of male characters? Or not?
Those of Hungarians, given that I am not Hungarian?
What are the rules, exactly?And do they apply to any story that isn’t my very own?
No one seems too sure about all this, though it’s sometimes argued that these issues arise only (or mostly?) if, say, a white writer profits from their use of the stories of marginalized people.
The American poet Paisley Rekdal has explored this subject in her book Appropriate (Norton, 2021) and her Lithub piece, “Struggling in Workshop with the Question of Cultural Appropriation” (16 Feb 2021).
“Cultural appropriation,” Rekdal writes, “is less a question of ‘staying in one’s lane,’ …than an evolving conversation we must have around privilege and aesthetic fashion in literary practice.”
The English novelist Margaret Drabble argued in 2004 that “appropriation is what novelists do. Whatever we write is, knowingly or unknowingly, a borrowing. Nothing comes from nowhere.”
Having created Guyanese and Jewish characters for her novel The Witch of Exmore and an 18th- century Korean royal protagonist for The Red Queen, Drabble later revised her view in a Publishers Weekly interview, saying, “You can’t just barge in there and assume you have got the right to tell other people’s stories. You have to react sensitively to other people.”
Can that be it?
Is it a question of sensitivity? A question of quality? Is avoiding stereotypes key?
Avoiding stereotypes is always key, surely, but the question remains:
Did I have the right to write Birds of Passage?
It’s true that issues of appropriation were not in the forefront of public attention when I was writing the novel in the early 1990s, also that race is not particularly significant in its pages.
Next question:
Do I have the right to republish Birds of Passage today?
Yes?
No?
What is my “lane”?Am I allowed to write only about myself — out of my own personal experiences?
(As some of you are aware, I have done this several times, and it’s a practice that has sometimes landed me in hot water.)(And I seem to be writing about my own personal experience again, right now. Or, am I mistaken about that?)
Let me do my best to move on, through this thicket, for I do have another question:
What role, if any, is played in this by profit?

The Grand Budapest Hotel boasts a stellar cast, including Ralph Fiennes, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Willem Dafoe, Tilda Swinton, Adrien Brody, Jude Law, and Jeff Goldblum, among many others. However, the true star of the film is the hotel itself. Set in the fictional Eastern European state of Zubrowka (inspired by the spa city of Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic, and named after a Polish bison grass vodka), the film tells a short history of Eastern Europe in the 20th century through the lens of this once-grand establishment.
We witness the hotel in its gilded 1930s heyday, bask in its opulent glow, and then watch as the ravages of time and the Soviet era gradually erode its grandeur. Finally, we find it transformed into a faded relic, the inspiration for a cherished book in the present day. This ambitious narrative demanded a remarkable feat of production design. To capture the passage of time within the same in-film space, the filmmakers ingeniously constructed multiple sets, each intricately layered within the others, like a cinematic Russian nesting doll.
Production designer Adam Stockhausen, a frequent collaborator of director Wes Anderson who also worked on The Darjeeling Limited (2007), Moonrise Kingdom (2012), Isle of Dogs (2018), and The French Dispatch (2021), describes the filmmaking process of The Grand Budapest Hotel as akin to solving a complex puzzle. He candidly admits that The Grand Budapest Hotel presented one of the most formidable challenges of his illustrious career, a sentiment echoed by his experience crafting the intricate stage design for Charlie Kaufman’s film-within-a-film Synecdoche, New York (2008).
BackgroundBefore traveling to Europe for location scouting, Wes Anderson and Adam Stockhausen conducted extensive research, studying archival photographs of numerous hotels across various locations, including London, Scotland, and Switzerland. This research provided a foundation for their exploration, allowing them to identify potential sites that aligned with their vision for the film.
During their European travels, Anderson and Stockhausen drew significant inspiration from the historical narratives embedded within the real-world locations they encountered. A poignant example was a local civic centre, once a testament to architectural grandeur, now left to decay. Stockhausen vividly recalls the hammer marks that marred the intricate carvings, a stark reminder of the passage of time and the erosion of beauty.
The town of Karlovy Vary in Czech Republic, with its picturesque pastel-coloured buildings lining the riverfront and its collection of elegant hotels perched on overlooking hills, perfectly captured the desired aesthetic and mood for the film. Its unique atmosphere ultimately inspired the choice of this location as the primary outdoor shooting site.
Bristol Palace HotelWhile Grandhotel Pupp is often cited as the primary aesthetic inspiration for Wes Anderson’s fictional Grand Budapest Hotel, the Bristol Palace Hotel in Karlovy Vary bears a more striking resemblance to the film’s iconic structure. Its distinctive pink facade, adorned with mansard roof, dormer windows, flanking turrets, and a stag atop its peak, was remarkably replicated in the film, creating a visually striking homage that almost appears like a hyper-realistic, larger-than-life version of the Bristol Palace.
The Bristol Palace Hotel is an integral part of the Bristol Group complex, a collection of seven buildings developed by two prominent Karlovy Vary families: the esteemed physician Dr. Willem Fasolt and the renowned hotelier family, the Tellers. Between 1872 and 1908, they constructed several properties in the tranquil “Westend” district of the city, including the Bristol Villa (now the Bristol Palace Hotel), Königsvila (Královská Villa), Teresa (Tereza), and Fasolt (now Livia), all intended to provide a haven for hospitality and relaxation.
Designed by Viennese architects Hans Schidl and Alfred Bayer in the spirit of Viennese historicism, the Bristol Palace Hotel showcases a captivating blend of architectural styles inspired by castle architecture. Recognised as one of the most valuable and visually appealing buildings in the Czech Republic, the iconic Bristol Palace Hotel should not be confused with the larger Hotel Bristol, the main building within the Bristol Group complex. The latter was constructed on the site of a former Jewish synagogue, tragically destroyed during the Nazi-orchestrated Kristallnacht in 1938.
Grandhotel PuppWhile Adam Stockhausen often cited Grandhotel Pupp as a major inspiration for The Grand Budapest Hotel, many believe the film draws more inspiration from the hotel’s dramatic location — perched on a hill, surrounded by forest, and overlooking the town of Karlovy Vary — and its overall sense of grandeur.
The 228-room Grandhotel Pupp significantly surpasses the Bristol Palace Hotel in size and age. Its history dates back to 1907 with the construction of the Saxony Hall by Anton Deiml, then Mayor of Karlovy Vary. Subsequently, Mayor Becher built the Bohemian Hall on adjacent land, creating direct competition. The Pupp family acquired the Saxony Hall in 1776 and later the Bohemian Hall in 1890. Between 1896 and 1907, renowned Viennese architects Fellner & Helmer transformed these family-owned buildings into the neo-Baroque Grandhotel Pupp that stands today. This rich and intricate history is meticulously detailed on the hotel’s official website.
Grandhotel Pupp boasts a distinguished guest list, having welcomed a diverse array of luminaries throughout its history. From the intellectual giants like Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud and Czech writer Franz Kafka to renowned composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Richard Wagner, and even historical figures like Russian astronaut Yuri Gagarin and statesmen Napoleon Bonaparte and Otto von Bismarck, the hotel has played host to a veritable who’s who of history.
Grandhotel Pupp made a cinematic appearance in the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale, where it served as the fictional Hotel Splendide, set in Montenegro.
Görlitz WarenhausWes Anderson sought a realistic location for filming the Grand Budapest Hotel’s interiors and discovered the vacant Görlitz department store, an abandoned building that allowed complete artistic control and time flexibility. This twentieth-century Görlitz Warenhaus, with its impressive atrium, became the centrepiece of the production. The atrium itself was transformed into the hotel lobby, while the open galleries of the surrounding floors were adapted into hotel corridors, complete with meticulously placed hotel rooms.
To furnish these spaces, the production team meticulously sourced furniture and decor from various eras, ensuring authenticity within the film’s timeline. The top two floors of the department store were repurposed to house production offices and storage for cameras and wardrobe. During the ten-week shoot in early 2013, the entire film crew, including actors Tilda Swinton, Willem Dafoe, and Ralph Fiennes, resided at the neighbouring Hotel Börse.
The site of the Görlitz Warenhaus has a rich history. In 1717, it housed the “Goldener Strauß” (Golden Ostrich) inn, which later expanded into a hotel. Inspired by the renowned Wertheim department store on Leipziger Platz in Berlin, the Görlitz city council envisioned a similar establishment at this location. Potsdam architect Carl Schmanns designed the “department store at the ostrich,” and construction commenced in 1912 after the demolition of the existing hotel. Built with a steel skeleton and adorned with an Art Nouveau facade, the department store opened to the public on 30 September 1913.
The Görlitz Warenhaus experienced multiple changes in ownership, and at one point, Anderson even considered purchasing the building to prevent its demolition. In June 2013, investor Winfried Stöcker acquired the property with plans to revive it as a department store. However, the reopening faced numerous delays, initially planned for 2016 and then for the fall of 2017, due to the realisation that extensive restoration and renovation were necessary.
In November 2020, the project encountered a significant setback when a dispute arose concerning the demolition of two neighboring buildings. Stöcker sought to demolish these structures to improve delivery access to the store and a nearby parking garage. However, the local landmark preservation office mandated their preservation. This impasse led to Stöcker threatening to abandon the entire project if demolition was not permitted.
The smallest detailsOccasionally, the scope of a film’s vision surpasses the limitations of physical sets. In such instances, the filmmakers must employ creative solutions. For The Grand Budapest Hotel, this involved a skillful blend of practical and digital techniques, utilizing matte paintings and miniature effects to convincingly create the illusion of grandeur and scale. Wes Anderson, while primarily favouring practical filmmaking, recognises the value of post-production techniques like visual effects, colour timing, and other digital enhancements, when necessary.
This approach is evident from the very beginning of the film. The introduction scene to the hotel involves a sweeping horizontal movement across the landscape. It culminates in a dramatic reveal of the hotel perched majestically atop a hill, with a funicular ascending towards it. This specific image was intentionally created using miniatures, as no such location exists in reality. This technique harkens back to the classic Hollywood tradition of utilising models to achieve desired cinematic effects.
Under the guidance of Simon Weisse, a team of skilled prop makers at Studio Babelsberg in Berlin meticulously constructed scale models of the structures, working in tandem with the production team at the Görlitz Warenhaus. The Grand Budapest Hotel set, featuring the hotel building atop a wooded ledge complete with a funicular, was meticulously crafted. This was further enhanced by a Friedrichian landscape painting seamlessly integrated with green-screen technology. The 3-meter-high hotel model was meticulously sculpted using silicone resin molds and adorned with intricate brass embellishments. To create the illusion of light, photographs of the Görlitz Warenhaus set were strategically placed within the model’s windows.
To achieve the aged, brutalist aesthetic of the Soviet-era Grand Budapest Hotel, the visual effects team employed a combination of computer-generated models, intricate lighting, matte effects, and carefully orchestrated shadows. A similar technique was utilised to create the observatory, where the base miniature was constructed in separate pieces. The observatory was rendered with 20 distinct elements, with the final digital rendering refined further at Anderson’s request, requiring approximately one hour per shot.
Costume designer Milena Canonero meticulously captured the essence of each character through their wardrobe. While the hotel uniforms adhered to the stylistic conventions of the 1930s, the color palette was intentionally unconventional. The majority of the costumes were crafted within the Görlitz Warenhaus workshop, with additional pieces sourced from Berlin-based Theaterkunst and the uniforms produced by a Polish workshop. The filmmakers drew inspiration from renowned artists such as photographers Man Ray and George Hurrell, and painters Gustav Klimt, Kees van Dongen, Tamara de Lempicka, and George Grosz.
Just as Wes Anderson enlisted Marc Jacobs, then creative director of Louis Vuitton, to design period-inspired suitcases for The Darjeeling Limited, he commissioned Miuccia Prada to create a 21-piece set of luggage for Madame D. (Tilda Swinton) and Concierge Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) in The Grand Budapest Hotel. Drawing inspiration from the 1920s and 1930s, when Prada primarily focused on leather goods, the luggage showcases exquisite turn-of-the-century finishes and the iconic Grana Paglia pattern. While not a central plot point, these meticulously crafted pieces leave a lasting impression on the viewer.
Graphic designWes Anderson enlisted graphic designer Annie Atkins to bring the fictional world of The Grand Budapest Hotel to life. Previously an art director at McCann Erickson in Reykjavik, Iceland, Atkins was relatively new to film design. She meticulously designed nearly every on-screen artefact bearing text — ubrowka money, police reports, passports, telegrams, pastry packaging, perfume lettering, and even a prison map.
To achieve this, Atkins drew inspiration from reference materials meticulously collected by herself, Anderson, and production designer Adam Stockhausen during extensive location scouting. Her dedication was evident in her meticulous process, often sketching 20 variations of a single artefact by hand daily. This painstaking effort paid off, allowing her to keep cherished mementos like the iconic The Grand Budapest Hotel book, a Mendl’s box, and a bloodstained telegram from Serge the butler.
Atkins’s attention to detail extended beyond the screen. She adapted the hotel’s entrance sign from a 1930s metal sign Anderson discovered in Cairo, creating a hand-drawn version with somewhat uneven, jaunty serifs. Even objects unseen on screen, like Ralph Fiennes’ character Gustave H’s notebook, received meticulous consideration. Fiennes preferred lined pages, though, reflecting the character’s personality, a detail that Wes loves.
The fictional newspapers in The Grand Budapest Hotel — The Trans Alpine Yodel, The Daily Fact, and The Continental Drift — showcase Anderson’s meticulousness. He wrote every story, regardless of on-screen appearance or relevance to the main plot, and Atkins designed each newspaper accordingly. Authenticity was paramount. Atkins even studied Hitler’s calling card to design a business card for a fascist character in the film.
For those seeking to replicate the “aged” look of props, Atkins offers a practical tip: use three Barry’s tea bags to age paper by ten years. Even if props are new within the film’s narrative, the audience expects an “old” aesthetic for a period piece.
DigitalTo further immerse audiences in the world of The Grand Budapest Hotel, a fictional website called the Akademie Zubrowka was created. This online platform, reminiscent of the 1960s, offered a series of stylised lessons on the history of the fictional Republic of Zubrowka.
Designed to seamlessly blend the aesthetics of the late 1960s with the 1930s setting of the film, the Akademie Zubrowka website mimicked a microfiche machine, complete with a navigational wheel to guide viewers through the digital “slides.” Photographs were meticulously recreated to resemble hand-coloured black-and-white prints, further enhancing the nostalgic ambiance.
Watson Digital, working closely with Fox Searchlight and director Wes Anderson himself, produced the entire site in-house. This collaborative effort allowed Anderson to fully explore and develop the stylised fictional world he envisioned, including an unusual amount of written content. While this presented a design challenge, the team embraced the opportunity to work directly with the director to bring his vision to life.
The Akademie Zubrowka was met with enthusiastic reception from fans of Anderson’s work. It provided a unique opportunity to delve deeper into the film’s world and was featured in publications such as Variety and MovieWeb.
Unfortunately, the Akademie of Zubrowka website was discontinued around 2018. However, interested viewers can still explore it through the Wayback Machine. Alternatively, if you ever had the pleasure of staying at the fictional Grand Budapest Hotel, you might consider sharing your experiences by writing a review on its (fictional) TripAdvisor page here.
The Grand Budapest Hotel was basically a critical darling, showing up on tons of critics’ “best of” lists. Everyone raved about how incredibly well-crafted it was, especially its zany vibe and that signature Wes Anderson touch. On Rotten Tomatoes, a whopping 92% of 319 critics gave it the thumbs up, while Metacritic gave it a fancy score of 88 out of 100 based on 48 reviews. The film’s Akademie Zubrowka also won numerous awards including one Webby in 2015.
At the 87th Academy Awards, the film received nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Film Editing. It ultimately won awards for Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and Best Original Score, which you can hear below.

Illusions of Grandeur in THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL
“To be frank, I think his world has vanished long before he ever entered it. But I will say, he certainly sustained the illusion with a marvelous grace.” — Zero Mustafa, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL
The key to survival in Wes Anderson’s 2014 film “The Grand Budapest Hotel” is keeping up appearances. Though the film is presented in Anderson’s trademark pristine dollhouse-like style, the world within it can be as nasty and ruthless as our own. One look at a poster for the film with its pastel colored buildings and calligraphic lettering gives no indication that the film will that feature brutal prison shankings, a beheading, and an extended shootout occuring on several floors of the eponymous hotel.
But that’s the artistry at work in Wes Anderson’s masterpiece: what appears to be merely a light, madcap romp turns out also to be a rather melancholy tale of two social climbers learning that there are dangers in the ritzy world of the upper class no different from the ones they’ve escaped.
Our two leads Zero and Monsieur Gustave are outsiders dealing in matters far above their pay grade, and only survive by taking heed to the old adage “act like you’ve been here before”.
Zero, whom we meet as the unassuming Lobby Boy and loyal sidekick of Monsieur Gustave turns out to be a refugee of Anderson’s version of WWII and the eventual owner of the hotel. Behind his big, watchful eyes hides a painful past filled with memories of the family he lost in the war.
While Gustave’s past is never quite so defined, we know from his own words he also came from humble beginnings, even once having served as Lobby Boy himself. What’s most fascinating about Gustave is that the persona he displays throughout the movie is a whole cloth fabrication. He’s no more a member of high-society than Zero, though he’d never let you know and you’d never be able to tell. He’s absorbed his regal, professional disposition from the aristocrats and old-money figures who frequent the hotel.
When the pair escape the home of the DeGoff und Taxis family with “Boy with Apple” in tow, they do so by doing their best to blend in and not draw attention to themselves (despite their loud purple uniforms). It isn’t until Gustave announces his presence that anyone even notices the two were there to begin with. And this isn’t the only time they find a way to look the part. Much of the last act is filled with the two changing in and out of various disguises in order to keep themselves out of early graves.
On two occasions we see Zero and Gustave aboard a train whose path is blocked by soldiers. searching for refugees. On these occasions, Zero escapes the firing squads his family fell victim to on the strength of Gustave’s good name, — “he’s with me” Gustave assures the soldiers — while Gustave survives (at least once) due to his aristocratic manner and past kind deeds, but a kind, aristocrat is not exactly who he is. Outside of his duties as concierge, Gustave can be rather profane, bitter, vain, rude, insensitive, and even crass, but he knows when to turn on the charm. That charm gets him brief access to the finest things Anderson’s world has to offer. Until it doesn’t.
Ultimately, Gustave meets that early grave he’d been eluding. The costume he wears can’t get him through every door or out of every jam. Being a rich, vain, blonde doesn’t save his life in the end, and truth be told, it never did. The character of “Monsieur Gustave H. of the Grand Budapest Hotel” gave him entree into this fanciful world, but it doesn’t protect him within it. What saves Gustave is his willingness in his darkest moments to strip away all (most) pretense and meet Zero and others on their level. Not as the concierge of an esteemed hotel, but as a helpless man who had no one else to turn to. For it isn’t any of his rich lovers who break him out of prison. His escape is made with the help of some lowly inmates and his loyal lobby boy. It’s not until he hears Zero’s story and feels his pain that they truly connect and become as Zero puts it “brothers”.
What Gustave internalizes in the end is that what endears one most to others is the way you treat them. No one likes Gustave because he’s posh or learned, they like him because of his meticulous attention to detail, his loyalty, and being as Captain Henckels puts it “very kind”. That kindness and care is what wins over his man lady “friends”, it’s what wins over his cutthroat cellmates, and it’s what fully wins over his eventual heir, Zero.

Note: Most review fragments taken from the author’s Reddit review.
I must be the most pathetic movie aficionados to not get the chance to watch Wes Anderson movies. I’ve heard the words: picturesque, aesthetic, symmetrical. All-in-all satisfying. I’ve heard The Grand Budapest Hotel in years, yet it’s only in 2021 where I get to watch it, 7 years after its release.
Can I just open by saying how I love myself after this? Because finally, finally, anticipation is paid off. Nearly-decade long anticipation. It is rare for a movie to leave me so amused as if I have just littered by mouth with foams of fluffy clouds. It’s like marijuana, but visual, coming from Disney, and legal. At least, in some states — OK, I admit, I have a bad sense of humour.
Nobody shall deny that this is splendid. If you’re looking for a movie to relax and to improve your eyesight, this could be one. A vintage yet faithful depiction of a fascist regime framed by slapstick humour. Often movies can’t blend various elements, but The Grand Budapest Hotel does it right. The cinematography, visuals, and editing are to die for — I can’t stress this enough. The hype is not overhyped, it seems for the first time. There are some issues, though, with the brightness (it often feels too bright), and I don’t understand why a squared aspect ratio is preferred for the modern-day but widescreen is used for the late 60s and 80s.
But also, nobody can deny that there is a flaw in this movie. A huge, huge flaw. It is not delivered well.
The first minutes are nothing short of a masterpiece. Somehow I find the way Madame saying “I’m not leaving” funny, it sounds like a rom-com satire. The inciting incident is expressed naturally, so I have few complaints.
Amid it, the movie starts falling apart, apart from the camerawork, acting, and grandeur overture. Considering the prologue and first two parts takes a long time, I expect the remaining time to be much more, not specifically longer, but more elements. Right now the main plot is easily predictable: there’s gonna be a winter prison break, and a kiddie fight for Boy with Apple.
Right now, the cinematography is misleading. It is like a visual drug to keep you awake on a starting-to-get-boring movie. Kinda the same for the acting. Some of the throwaway plot points still remain enjoyable, but they don’t contribute to improving the plot. Because of the nature of the movie, everything feels trivial and I don’t connect with the characters anymore.
The ending is melancholic and satisfying. But a large part of “satisfying” is, “Finally! This movie is over I kinda… knew it.” I didn’t feel anything, other than the common chills I get every time I see a movie. I didn’t feel moved or questioning things or stuff like that. Except I did question one thing: “Why did they choose that font for the subtitles?”
The Grand Budapest Hotel is not a cursed premise nor an unnatural narrative. It explores controversial and strong themes, with great technical work. But Wes Anderson did not seem to dive deeper into the script, rather only anticipated in shooting it. The movie is a fine work. But it’s not great, and can do better. Nobody can deny, though, that Gustave’s legacy will carry on for long on the big screen.

Sitting in the Dark
Like most survivors of extreme trauma, my father Laszlo never talked about what he had endured during and after WWII. Such avoidance is understandable — why bring back pain so mercifully repressed with the help of time, distractions, and forgetfulness? Why relive reminders of suffering and death, when the guilt of survival is already too much to bear?
Laszlo never spoke much, anyway, facilitating his evasion while exacerbating my curiosity. Weekday nights he’d come home from work at 5pm, demanding dinner on the table. We ate with my mother in awkward silence, or cowering from his wrath. From there he sat in his big chair in front of the TV, reading the paper until 10pm. Off to bed, rinse and repeat.
One random night the power went out, no television and no light to read his newspaper. As we lit candles and sat in the flickering shadows, I asked him again about the war. The few times I tried were failures, Laszlo wondering why I would care, why would anyone care, since he and his family suffered to the indifference of their neighbors, and the world.
He made a good point, but that night I gave it another whirl, and — surprise surprise — he started to speak slowly in his native Hungarian, buried words arduously clawing to the surface. He had a deep, Bela Lugosi voice, and I felt as though The Grinch Who Stole Christmas were narrating The Bombing of Budapest. We journeyed to Hungary in 1944, only thirty years before…
That summer an average of ten thousand people were murdered per day in the camps. Meanwhile, sixteen-year-old Laszlo lived large at a refurbished Jewish Community Center taken over by the Gestapo and SD. He was part of the expendable local help that had been rounded up by the Germans soon after the Tiger tanks clanked through the cobbled Budapest streets.
Jewish talent was recruited by the Germans across various trades: tailors, seamstresses, carpenters, electricians. Laszlo was chosen by his high school principal as designated draftsman, price paid for being the most talented in shop class. The Nazis gave him his own secretary and office — he decorated it with mounted animal heads ripped from a taxidermist’s shop.
Laszlo was a tall, dashing, Errol Flynn-looking kid with a deeply cynical sense of humor, and the Übermensch thought he was cool. Laszlo thought the tall, dashing, blond-haired blue-eyed Aryans were cool, too, creating an odd Ashkenazi-Nazi dynamic. Entertaining them as class clown and mascot, they printed official documents making him an officer in the SD.
Laszlo felt invincible as most teens do, and had no idea what was soon in store, including a brush with Adolf Eichmann, being caught playing cards on the job, nearly beaten to death and thrown into solitary confinement, released with no shoes into the wintry Siege of Budapest, hidden in a neighbor’s cellar, and nearly deported to Siberia by the Russians.
At some point between sharing air with Eichmann and being tortured, Laszlo sat in his office one summer evening, drawing Wehrmacht uniform insignia and various armaments. The air raid siren went off, staffers panicked. Above them the B-24 Liberators from the Fifteenth Expeditionary Air Force were in formation, attacking the city.
The heavy aircraft dropped mines into the Danube River, and bombs onto Hungarian factories, refineries, and oil tanks. They also released leaflets throughout Budapest that boldly threatened the enemy with retribution for deporting thousands of Jews to the gas chambers in Auschwitz. The world was watching, they said — too bad the Allies didn’t actually try to stop it.
Seeing the Light
“We must go downstairs to the shelter!” the secretary shrieked, rushing into his office. Weighing whether to follow her and use the fog of war to try and get some nookie, or see what was going on, he opted for the latter. “A direct hit kills us all, anyway,” he said. “So I’m going up to the roof. Want to join me?” Despite his resemblance to Errol Flynn, she fled into the bunker.
He went up, not down, made himself comfortable on the rooftop, and watched the show. Search lights darted across the sky, as anti-aircraft flak burst around the illuminated bomber formations and escorting fighter squadrons. Laszlo watched streams of incendiaries pour out of the big planes, saw the distant explosions as factories and depots erupted.
An unlucky Liberator took a direct hit, left wing breaking off as the bomber dipped and plummeted. Spiraling downward, several parachutes became visible, bobbing dreamily as they floated serenely over the roiling city. Laszlo wondered what being an allied serviceman flying in those planes and now shot down must be like, descending into a strange city at war.
As a kid, Laszlo loved watching American movies, and like most Europeans romanticized the States based on Hollywood films. His emulation of Errol Flynn was no accident, the actor smoothly embodying the epitome of a swashbuckling lady’s man. Laszlo loved him in The Adventures of Robin Hood. Bored in class, he dreamt of some day becoming a Yankee Doodle.
As a teen, Laszlo watched the real life show of swiveling beams reflect off the flak bursts and vapor trails, as the surviving heavy bombers released their loads and flew back to safety, the anti-aircraft fire dying down and search lights thinning. Still alive, he trundled back downstairs and returned to his office. “You are crazy!” his secretary said, duly impressed.
Everything went back to “normal” until about an hour later, when Laszlo heard commotion and loud, guttural German voices outside his office. He went to his door, opened it, and saw his Nazi buddies standing nearby chatting, pointing, and calling out. One of the parachuting bombardiers had been caught, and was now put on display for his merciless captors.
Three decades later in flickering candle light, Laszlo shared his wonder at making direct eye contact with his first American: A young man only a few years older, red haired and freckled, wearing a US airman’s uniform and boots. Beaten, his face was covered in gashes and welts — too weak to walk, he was dragged down the hallway, his crimson blood trailing behind.
Laszlo knew nothing about the Geneva Conventions, and neither did the Gestapo, who tortured Laszlo’s First American to death a few doors down the hall. As I watched my father speak, I imagined young Laszlo at his desk beneath the mounted animal heads, trying to concentrate as the young US flyer cried out. American dream turned to nightmare, an ominous sign?
Only a few months earlier, Laszlo was hanging out with his friends, complaining about his parents, ignoring his younger brother, trying to get laid, and wondering about his future when the most brutal war in human history literally came knocking at his door. Of the hundred or so students in his high school class, only sixteen survived. He was one of them.
The price usually paid for survival is guilt: “Why was I spared, and not the others?” Another cost is the jealousy, defeatism, and victimization that guilt-ridden survivors hurl at their own families. A few decades after that fateful evening, Laszlo stared into the face of another American — his first and only son. I likely filled him with equal curiosity, wonder, and terror.

Apart from one firecracker set off one day early, a neighbor having a short but noisy party in the late evening, and a couple waking me up with their rather loud orgasms the morning after, there was no real sign of celebration.
I traveled to Budapest on the 27th of December, thinking that New Year’s Eve (NYE) may be like Christmas in Budapest; everything including the busses shuts down around 3 PM, and if you’re unlucky enough not to have booked a taxi then you aren’t likely to go anywhere unless you are walking. And many people do. From morning until late afternoon, you will see people out for ‘walks’, but they are actually on their way to where they are celebrating Christmas Eve. They’ll be dressed in moderately nice clothes and carrying wine bottles or other enjoyable Christmas things. However, NYE is not all like like Christmas Eve in this bohemian city — people just don’t care that much — and this surprised me enough to jump into an air balloon — literally.
You see, when I realized that I had again made a booboo — last year I knew nothing about busses shutting down and ended up needing to get picked up by family members — and that I should have booked myself onto a NYE boat trip or some form of party for tourists, I was rather upset. Not even my cousin…

It wasn’t a long time ago when I asked Stefan about his work, but here comes a new interview, since he has just finished another drawing on Budapest. Let’s find out what has happened to him since last September.
What has happened to you since we spoke last year?All of a sudden, things went really fast after our first interview. Apart from two successful exhibitions in Holland, the media took note of my work last December, which led to newspaper publications in the UK, Belgium, Holland and Italy and a score of Internet publications. Later on, in January, I was invited to appear on the Belgian national television in a talk show named Bart and Siska. Currently, I’m preparing work for a number of future exhibitions in Holland and Switzerland later this year.
If you speak Dutch here is the video for you to watch:http://www.een.be/programmas/bart-siska/tekentalent-stefan-bleekrode
You have just finished another drawing on Budapest. Could you tell us about the process? The initial large-scale drawing was merely based on Budapest; I used the architecture and many landmarks to create a “new” city based on Budapest. I wasn’t entirely satisfied with that work because of the faulty perspective and somewhat monotonous background. Immediately, I felt I needed to do another piece sometime. It took me almost two years to meditate on this new piece that had to include not just most of the famous sights but also offers a view more captivating than the previous drawing.
The perspective plays a major role in all of Stefan’s works. He is well known for drawing from a bird’s eye perspective so I was eager to hear about how the process went this time. Furthermore, Budapest also belongs to that group of cities that offer a lot of possibilities for artists to capture it on their artworks. Last time Stefan was flying from the Liberty Bridge towards the Margaret Island, but now he has begun his trip in District 13.
How did you decide on the perspective of the drawing this time?This perspective was in my mind already for quite a long time but it took me a while to get things sorted out, and not until my previous visit to Budapest, last year in May, I felt confident enough to tackle what was really quite a difficult subject. When I walked around the city I noticed there were many geometric forms, for instance the street layout and the rooftop angles. This perspective is broken by straight and diagonal boulevards, and the river running across the city. Getting the perspective right was essential.
Before I did any ink drawing I made extensive pencil sketches to get the composition right. So I made the Saint Stephen’s Boulevard shorter than in reality and left some of the area South of it out of the drawing. To make the drawing a bit less monotonous, an endless sea of roofs, I made Elisabeth Square and Déak Square bigger, kind of turned it into a park. Still, even as I went along I kept making changes: I made the river wider, and later on I decided to raise the horizon a bit and obscure it with a watercolour wash.
Stefan’s success cannot be only seen in the media but he actually makes a living as an artist, which does not necessarily happen to everyone who dedicates her/his life to art. Stefan is an exception as he has sold several of his artworks and probably will sell many more. Let’s find out where one should look for the new drawing(s)!
What happens to it now?The drawing got sold immediately upon completion to a Dutch family who used to live in Budapest for three years. I suppose it will be framed now before the buyers collect it from the gallery.
Are you planning to draw more pieces on Budapest?Yes, there’s already a small drawing under construction of a busy intersection with trams and buses, similar to Astoria. Maybe one day I’ll do a view of Buda Castle and the old district next to it. Other than that, I was thinking of doing perhaps a city like Pécs, I haven’t been there yet but it is apparently very beautiful.
Unfortunately, we still have to wait for an exhibition taking place in Hungary, but if you happen to be in the Netherlands or Switzerland, take the opportunity and visit one of the galleries showcasing Stefan’s pieces. Stefan is naming the destination in his last answer.
If someone is interested in seeing your works in person where s/he should go?My work is currently on sale and display at the Frank Welkenhuysen Gallery in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Besides this, I’ll have a show with oil colours at Galerie Müller in Luzern this summer and more drawings will go on display at Keine Kunst in Bern this fall. But it would be great to show some of my Hungary-inspired pieces in Budapest or elsewhere!

I will never forget the first time I saw the Danube. It was my first time in Budapest, and, as I walked toward the impressive world-famous Hungarian Parliament Building, I saw the beautiful city lights reflected on the river’s peaceful waters under the pink and purple sunset. I was speechless.
Hungary is most known for its fascinating capital, Budapest, recently considered the second best city to visit in Eastern Europe in U.S. News ranking and included in Time’s World’s Greatest Places in 2023. However, this country has much more to offer to international visitors and tourism has significantly recovered in the past few years.
Data Confirms Travelers Want To Explore Hungary And Love Budapest
More than 6 million international travelers explored the country this summer 2023. According to Statista, most foreign visitors are from neighboring countries: Slovakia, Romania, and Austria.
However, especially in Budapest, you can encounter travelers from all over the world. This is a relief as it’s easier to communicate in English and it is the most common language used in tourist places and among visitors. I tried to learn a few words in Hungarian but couldn’t get past “thank you” — Köszönöm — , and I quickly understood why Hungarian is considered one of the most difficult languages in the world. Luckily, this is not a barrier to visiting, but tour guides do help provide a much more enriching experience.
The Hungarian government said that tourism exceeded their expectations in 2022 and that this year the records will show higher rates compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019. And it’s easy to see why this destination attracts more travelers.
Hungary Is A Perfect Destination For Pleasure And Relaxation
There are over 1,300 thermal water springs — Budapest is home to more than 100 — where tourists can relax and experience the best of Hungarian culture most times of the year. From historical places with outstanding architecture to calming retreats in rural areas.
Travelers usually enjoy eating local food with unique flavors and exotic combinations. I can now say that the goulash is one of my favorite soups, and the Hungarian pizza, the Langallo, must be added to any traveler’s bucket list.
Enriching Experiences Beyond Food And Spas
Hungary has so much to offer. Those who enjoy a fun night can have a special time at the ruin bars or try one of Budapest’s top attractions: take a Danube River cruise.
History lovers will be amazed at all the drama related to Empress Elisabeth of Austria — known as Sissi — and can also admire the sculptures and all the incredible stories behind them.
Even though the predominant religion is Catholic, visitors can see fascinating buildings and chapels from different religions like the Great Synagogue of Budapest — the largest in Europe — or Matthias Church on Castle Hill in Budapest.
Depending on your travel plans, there are also festivals, events, and new attractions. Hungary is one of those destinations that make you want to go back even before you leave.

Budapest, Hungary.
We've had fun over these last few weeks trying to figure out how to ask the most basic of questions, “Do you speak English” which at face value doesn't sound overly difficult. You would be mistaken. Our brains are like sieves and as quick as I pour the “Sprechen Sie Englisch?”, “mluvíš anglicky” and “beszélsz angolul” in, it falls right back out. Personally, I blame the internet.
As you start getting hit with travel fatigue and a loss of direction on big trips like these, there are some cities which pull you right back into the fray and make you realise how beautiful Europe during Christmas can be. Budapest certainly falls into this category and after almost two months, two continents and nine countries deep we needed it.
Our first few days saw us checking out the usual city landmarks of castles, churches and Christmas markets and they certainly didn't disappoint in any way. The awe-inspiring Buda Castle in the aptly named Castle district where we visited an underground labyrinth (used as a war shelter, jail and even linked to Dracula!) was amazing. The stunning St Stephens Basilica and Fishermans Bastion; everywhere you look there is something gorgeous and jaw-dropping.
The highlight of this city was definitely the natural hot spring baths of Széchenyi, opened in 1913 and looking the part. Three huge outdoor pools (25°C–35°C) and a multitude of indoor pools, spas and steaming hot saunas. The snow falling all around and -4°C at arrival made it even more special. I highly recommend Budapest to anyone and everyone.
Christmas day was spent in Krakow, Poland and was indeed a white one. I will say it was a quiet few days for us as George came down with a nasty bout of the flu. I took to the streets myself and kept the step counter going by walking the wet and snowy alleys and side paths. Up to Wawel castle, through the Jewish quarter and around Old town.
While in Krakow we visited the Auschwitz concentration camp for the day. It sits about 60kms out of Krakow, it covers a massive area, contains multiple different camps and is about as sombre as you can imagine. It didn't feel right to take a heap of photos or selfies out of consideration for every one that passed through this place so I've only included a couple of the complex.
Next stop is Warsaw and then the Baltic states for New Year's Eve. Bring it on.
Gary.

Here is my take on this exercise from a previous series of posts — How To Read A Screenplay:
After a first pass, it’s time to crack open the script for a deeper analysis and you can do that by creating a scene-by-scene breakdown. It is precisely what it sounds like: A list of all the scenes in the script accompanied by a brief description of the events that transpire.
For purposes of this exercise, I have a slightly different take on scene. Here I am looking not just for individual scenes per se, but a scene or set of scenes that comprise one event or a continuous piece of action. Admittedly this is subjective and there is no right or wrong, the point is simply to break down the script into a series of parts which you then can use dig into the script’s structure and themes.
The value of this exercise:
* We pare down the story to its most constituent parts: Scenes.
* By doing this, we consciously explore the structure of the narrative.
* A scene-by-scene breakdown creates a foundation for even deeper analysis of the story.
This week: The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). You may download the script here.
Screenplay by Wes Anderson, story by Wes Anderson & Hugo Guinness, inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig
IMDb plot summary: The adventures of Gustave H, a legendary concierge at a famous hotel from the fictional Republic of Zubrowka between the first and second World Wars, and Zero Moustafa, the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend.
The Grand Budapest Hotel
Scene by Scene Breakdown
by Rob Hoskins
GoIntoTheStory.com
1–2: In present day, a girl enters Old Lutz Cemetery. She stops at a bust of ‘Author’, memorialized with hotel-room keys hanging on hooks. She holds a book, ‘The Grand Budapest Hotel’, with the Author’s face on the back cover. Twenty years prior, in his study, the same-aged author, begins the narration of the story.
2–6: The late sixties. The author describes how he came to take up rooms in the once-celebrated GBH, and laments its “present” state and descent into shabbiness. It is sparsely populated by a rather solitary group of vacationers, and overseen by the second-rate concierge M. Jean.
Introducing Mr. Moustafa. A figure projecting true loneliness. M. Jean provides an overview of his rags to riches story and the author is intrigued. The primer on Mr. Moustafa is interrupted as M. Jean sprints to action, to save a fat businessman from choking on his biscotti.
6–8: Fate intervenes, and the author and Mr. Moustafa meet in the hammam. Mr. Moustafa opens a polite conversation by stating his admiration for the author’s work. “How did you come to buy it… the Grand Budapest?”, the curious author inquires. Mr. Moustafa invites him to dine and to hear his story.
8: Mr. Moustafa commences the narration of the main story: ‘It begins of course with…’
Part 1: “M. Gustave”
9–16: M. Gustave, in his element, directing hotel staff in the service of guests. An elegant, well-oiled (and well-perfumed) machine. He sits with Madame C.V.D.u.T. (referred to in the script as “Madame D.”). It soon becomes apparent that M.G. is personally redefining “customer service”. He attempts to soothe her fearful intuition that they will never see each other again. They exchange “I love you”s, and he abruptly dispatches Madame D.’s driver to Lutz. As M. Gustave dictates to the lobby boy he suddenly realizes that he doesn’t know him.
16–19: Young Zero Moustafa’s interview begins. He has “zero” experience, education, or family, but impresses M.G. with a perfect answer to a deceptively tricky question.
19–20: Montage: Lobby Boy training begins. M. Gustave will be Zero’s counselor and guardian.
Zero performs the various and sundry tasks and duties of his position, anticipating the needs of the guests, with discretion as a guiding principle.
21–22: Zero begins to realize that, with respect to M. Gustave, “many of the guests came for him”, and that it “was also his pleasure.”
22–23: A day in the life, as Zero awakens in his tiny room and quickly grooms himself.Gustave sermonizes and recites from a small podium in the mess hall as the staff is served.
M.G. dines in a small room, nearly identical to Zero’s, but well-stocked with “L’air de Panache”.
23: Deputy Kovacs arrives to review the books with M. Gustave and business manager Herr Becker. Kovacs also conveys messages on behalf of the mysterious, unidentified owner of the GBH.
23–24: Introducing Agatha. Plain, graceful, seventeen years old, with a birthmark the shape of Mexico on the side of her face. She works a rolling pin in Mendl’s patisserie and has the air of a true artisan. She rides her bicycle through the town, a yoke bearing pink boxes balanced across her shoulders. Mr. Moustafa’s story ends abruptly: “ — but we won’t discuss that.”
Part 2: “Madame C.V.D.u.T.”
24–26: Carrying a stack of newspapers, Zero scans the headlines and comes to a stop. He dashes off to share the news with M. Gustave: Madame D. is dead. M.G.: “We must go to her.” He instructs Zero to pack quickly… and to bring a bottle of the Pouilly-Jouve ‘26.
26–31: As the train speeds toward Lutz, they sit in the first class cabin drinking chilled white wine. M.G. assesses the situation, particulary the disposition and motives of Madame D.’s family. He waxes philosophic, and rather bluntly discusses their physical intimacy.
The train comes to an abrupt halt in the middle of nowhere, and soldiers burst into their cabin. They ask them to produce papers, and briefly question Zero. M.G.’s charm offensive fails, and the soldiers sieze Zero against the protestations of his guardian. Cpt. Henckels arrives, having heard the commotion. He recognizes M. Gustave and apologizes, ordering his and Zero’s release. He gives Zero a temporary transit permit.
Gustave favorably notes the “faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity.”
31–34: They arrive in Lutz, at Madame D.’s mansion. Clotilde the maid attends to them.
Gustave surveys Madame D.’s corpse and expresses his admiration for her appearance. She has finally gotten in right… in death.
The butler M. Serge, via Clotilde, asks for a word with M.G. He and Zero wait for a moment for Serge, who is seen through the glass looking agitated and distraught.
34–39: M. Gustave impatiently marches into the Grand Hall, where relatives close and distant have gathered, their greed roused.
Kovacs enters and unceremoniously deposits onto a podium a large pile of documents that comprise Madame D.’s last will and testament. He sums up her intention as granting the bulk of the estate to Dimitri, her son, but then refers to an “additional codicil” recently received but not yet legally verified.
He reads the codicil: M. Gustave receives the priceless painting “Boy with Apple”.
Dimitri, outraged, confronts M.G., questioning both his intentions and his virility. A punchout, with the final blow struck by Dimitri’s muscle, Jopling.
39–42: M.G. goes to leave. Waiting again for the still agitated Serge, he piques Zero’s interest and they go to have a look at the painting. Zero suggests, first with his eyes, then by fetching a footstool, that possession is nine tenths of the law.
Serge wraps the painting for them, but not before surreptitiously inserting a letter marked “Confidential”. He remains cryptic, preferring to say no more. They depart for the train station.
42–44: In their train compartment at night, M. Gustave and Zero make a pact. They will sell “Boy with Apple”, with Zero to receive a commission, and then “lay low somewhere along the Maltese Riviera until the troubles blow over”. M.G. also bequeaths his belongings to Zero upon his death in exchange for Zero’s assistance.
44–45: Back at The Grand Budapest, they hide and lock up the painting. One of the bellboys advises that the police have arrived and are asking for M. Gustave. M.G. warns Zero to remain silent before the authorities. They announce his arrest. He acknowledges the murder, as if having suspected it, then suddenly bolts to escape. The policemen give chase.
Part 3: “Checkpoint 19 Criminal Internment Camp”
45–49: Zero visits M. Gustave, whose eyes are blackened. He has had to prove his virility to his new best friends.
Zero has spoken to Kovacs, who in flashback explains the theory of M.G.’s guilt to zero. Serge is revealed to have been the “witness” to M.G.’s illegal entry. Zero attempts to encourage M. Gustave and leaves him with a courtesan au chocolat from Mendl’s.
49–50: The dark, menacing Jopling visits the sister of Serge, looking for him. He continues his search by night, speeding through the city on his black motorcycle.
50–52: Zero reads a letter from M.G. to the staff, dictating his wishes and effectively managing the hotel from prison. Zero embodies the presence of M. Gustave, even taking the time to recite his tediously florid stanzas from the podium.
52–56: M. Gustave makes friends in prison, serving mush to a scar-faced giant, then sharing a beautiful, decadent Mendl’s pastry with Pinky and the gang. Ludwig sums up the physical challenges of an escape. They’ve found a possible way out, but need digging tools.
56: Returning to Mr. Moustafa, who cries as he recounts to the author the role Agatha played.
56–58: Zero and Agatha’s romance. He proposes, she accepts. He presents her with a gift of poetry.
58–59: M. Gustave interviews Agatha, ostensibly on Zero’s behalf. He playfully flirts with her and gives her gifts — a white porcelain pendant and five dozen white tulips — arousing Zero’s jealousy.
59–60: The equally brave and skilled Agatha hides digging tools in pastries so beautifully decorated that the “slice and dice” guard decides against damaging them with his cleaver.
60–62: Kovacs attempts to counsel Dimitri and family but they refuse his advice, uninterested in either the legal process or the intentions of the deceased. Jopling throws Kovacs’ cat out the window.
62: M. Gustave and the inmates are making progress, digging through the floor of their cell.
62–64: Zero sneaks into Agatha’s room and they share a couple’s moment together. He tells her of the stolen painting. She refuses to participate or even accept the note describing its location. He leaves it for her anyway.
64–66: Jopling rejoins his pursuit of Kovacs, following him to and through the darkened art museum. He slams shut an exit door, cutting off Kovacs’ escape route and his fingers, then delivers the death blow.
Later Herr Becker receives a message from the office of Kovacs, postponing their scheduled meeting indefinitely.
67–75: Zero arrives by bus to a dark, deserted roadside. He makes his way to an open area with a manhole, and seems to be waiting.
Lights out in the prison, and the inmates make their escape. M. Gustave’s large, scar-faced friend aides them by silencing a would-be whistle blower. One inmate loses his life as he assassinates three guards gathered around a card table.
They exit through the manhole, to the waiting Zero. M.G. introduces them all and begins to pontificate. The other three beat a hasty retreat to a waiting bus.
For his part, Zero has failed to secure a safe house, an escape route, and has even failed to bring the L’air de Panache. M.G. berates him, until Zero explains how he became a refugee. M.G. delivers a heartful apology on behalf of himself and the hotel, and reiterates to Zero and his affection for him. “We’re brothers”, says Zero.
Gustave makes a collect call to M. Ivan of…
Part 4: “The Society of the Crossed Keys”
76–78: The concierge fraternity jumps into action. A chain of phone calls. Each concierge drops what he is doing — whether giving directions, conducting a chorus of “Happy Birthday”, or administering emergency medical assistance — and delegates to his second in command. “Take over!”
78–81: M. Gustave assesses the situation and tries to make sense of it all, alongside a confused Zero. M. Ivan speeds into frame in his limo and spirits them away to the train station. The society has found Serge and a meeting with him has already been arranged. And M. Ivan has even brought the L’air de Panache.
81–83: Cpt. Henckels discovers their escape and gives “dragnet” instructions. Jopling also begins tracking them.
83–84: Dimitri orders Jopling to step up the aggression with Serge’s sister. He suddenly notices the obscene painting which has taken the place of “Boy with Apple”, and smashes it against a small marble statue.
84–86: M.G. puts Serge’s supposed betrayal in perspective. He expresses to Zero his admiration for Agatha and asks to officiate the wedding.
86–87: Alone in her room, Agatha packs. Hearing a noise, she sticks her head through the frame of the skylight. She sees nothing.
Henckels reads a headline “Young Girl’s Head Found in Laundry Basket”. The basket is brought to him. He reaches in and lifts out the head of Serge’s sister.
Part 5: “Gabelmeister’s Peak”
87–95: In the Alpine foothills, Jopling examines a bloodied document as a young attendant fuels up his motorcycle.
Soldiers catch the scent of L’air de Panache.
Zero and M. Gustave make for their high-altitude rendez-vous with Serge X. A monk instructs that they board the next cable car. Halfway up, another monk intercepts them and switches cable cars with the two, sending them off to the opposite peak. A third monk provides them with robes and bibles to join the choral assembly. The final monk send them to confess.
Serge sits opposite in the confessional box. He tells M.G. that there is a second will, and he has made a second copy. Suddenly his story is interrupted. He has been strangled by a now escaping Jopling.
95–99: As Jopling skis away, M.G. and Zero give chase by sled. They speed down the mountain, with Zero barely able to steer.
Jopling comes to the end of the run and watches as M. Gustave and Zero come barreling down, out of control, slamming into the snow bank at the bottom, then flying through the air. Zero lands head first in the snow, practically disappearing, and M. Gustave is nearly thrown off the edge of the cliff.
As M.G. dangles over the edge, Jopling fractures the ice with the heel of his boot. Graceful even in the face of death, M. Gustave’s poetic verses are rudely interrupted as Zero shoves Jopling off the mountain.
Henckels spots the fugitive and accomplice and warns them not to flee. They flee. Zero’s plan is to steal Jopling’s motorcycle, fetch Agatha, take back “Boy with Apple”, and head for the Maltese Riviera, once and for all. But first, a moment of silence for Serge.
99–109: Mr. Moustafa narrates: “The war began at midnight.” The lobby of the GBH is filled with fascists. It has become “a troops’ barracks”. “Z-Z” symbols are plastered everywhere.
Agatha makes a delivery of pink boxes for the soldiers as M. Chuck manages room logistics for his new guests.
Agatha, alone in the vault, follows Zero’s written instructions and retrieves the wrapped painting. Outside the hotel, M. Gustave and Zero observe from a Mendl’s truck. M.G. laments the state of the Grand Budapest under its new occupants. They watch with concern as Dimitri enters the hotel.
Agatha looks for an escape route, and bee-lines into the elevator, asking the operator for the top floor. Dimitri intercepts her and goes along for the ride, while she nervously avoids eye contact. He eyes the package she’s carrying and gingerly peels back the wrapping. “Boy with Apple”.
Gustave and Zero deliver another stack of pink pastry boxes courtesy of Herr Mendl. Dimitri follows Agatha off the elevator and she makes a break for it. He has lost her in the hallway. As M.G. and Zero step from the elevator Dimitri spots them and opens fire. A shootout ensues as soldiers step out from their rooms to enter the fray. Henckels calls for them to cease fire.
A scream. Agatha, and the painting, hang from the edge of the building. Zero leaps to save her, but overshoots and now dangles from the same railing. They are saved as they crash into the Mendl’s truck below.
She has noticed something on the back of the painting…
Part 6: “The Second Copy of the Second Will”
109–114: Madame D. left everything to M. Gustave: the mansion, the factories, a newspaper syndicate… and the GBH.
M.G. anoints Zero as his successor, the new concierge. He officiates the wedding of Zero and Agatha. Mr. Moustafa recounts how two years later Agatha and his infant son died from the ‘Prussian gripe’.
Zero and Agatha travel with M. Gustave by train toward Lutz. M.G. acknowledges his humble beginnings as a lobby boy, and that Zero finally surpassed him. Agatha recites a stanza about two brothers, “one from the east and one from the west”.
They are again stopped in the middle of nowhere by fascist thugs. This time they are not so lucky. The leader rips up Zero’s transit papers. M. Gustave steps up to defend him.
Back to 1965: Mr. Moustafa reveals that the soldiers shot him.
114–117: In summing up M. Gustave he echoes his mentor’s own words. “There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse once known as humanity. He was one of them.”
The author inquires hesitantly as to why Mr. Moustafa has traded a great fortune for this doomed hotel. He kept it for Agatha. Her crossed-keys pendant is pinned to his jacket.
The author sits alone writing in a small notebook.
“It was an enchanting old ruin, but I never managed to see it again.”
The author at seventy five sits alone writing in a small notebook.
Back to present day. The girl sits on a bench, finishing the final chapter of “The Grand Budapest Hotel”.

Today I’ll be your guide on a journey through culture and cuisine!
Buda-Best stole my heart and became a safe place for healing scars. Whenever I face a difficult period in my life, my curing place wipes my tears, when I escape I run to you. Your elegant streets bring harmony to my soul, give me solutions when I question what my future steps should be, and help me overcome what is better left in the past. You can almost feel the history and breathe the love of its stories. Anyone can be skeptical about the country but never of its capital.
“You can’t buy happiness, but you can buy a plane ticket to Budapest. And that’s pretty much the same thing.”
I spent a lot of my childhood and teenage years in Budapest. I always told my little brother, with whom I visited a million times, that when he grows up I want him to take a backpack and go out into the wide world to find his happiness… but that he shouldn’t forget his home.
My home town is located only 100 km from Budapest. I was living between two cultures, Slovak and Hungarian. I believe everyone has a certain bond to a country of their origin, but I have to admit that Bratislava is not as magnificent as Budapest. It’s just…

The Marauding Mummy

My inner germaphobe recoiled in horror as I dipped my toes into the steamy, chlorine-free waters of Szechenyi Baths. Nobody else seemed to mind that this place was the perfect breeding ground for a multitude of horrifying drug-resistant bacteria. White and caramel-colored bodies sat placidly in the armpit grease-filled pools, enveloped by rising steam, but a few were busy sucking in their tummies and sticking out their chests for the ‘gram.
“Weeeeeeeeee!” my 5-year-old screamed as he dive-bombed into a pool outdoors, splashing murky water onto several flawlessly made-up faces. The aspiring models waded away, scowling.
The city’s claim to fame — its thermal springs — have long attracted scores of admirers. First came the Romans, who established their regional capital here over 2,000 years ago after Marcus Aurelius discovered that his soldier’s wounds healed faster when they bathed in these hot springs, and then the Turks who, during their occupation in the 16th and 17th century, constructed a handful of public baths which are still being used today.
Among the dozens of baths around Budapest, Szenchenyi is one of the largest and most popular spa complexes in Europe, hosting everyone from Madonna to Richard Nixon. In this handsome building more than a hundred years old, you can find indoor pools with temperatures that range form hot to only-Satan-bathes-here…
…and three open-air pools — only the latter is open to kids under 14.
So there I was, on a chilly May morning, shivering in my bikini. I couldn’t decide which was more appealing — hypothermia or staph infection — but my kids chose for me, having jumped into the pool immediately after disrobing.
As soon as I found myself relaxing in the water, my kids pulled me to the centre of the pool (correction: whirlpool) where we spun around like a a pair of socks in a tumble dryer and I almost fractured my hip bone trying to escape.
After toweling off, we went to Heroes’ Square to cower before the fierce countenance of the Magyars, the ancestors of present day Hungarians . The Magyars — skilled horsemen who are said to have originated from Central Asia — were the most fearsome warriors after the Vikings. I felt a little thrill knowing that my Asian brothers managed to ride all the way here over a thousand years ago, pillaging and conquering towns along the way…
…but the statues bear more resemblance to Harrison Ford than any Asian I’ve known.
Anyway, I totally get why the Magyars wanted to settle here.
Hungary is flat like the Steppes, and a river winds placidly through the capital, carrying with it wealth and news from other parts of Europe. The Danube, however, was not blue as Johann Strauss has promised, but rather the colour of a day-old baby’s poop (which explains why nobody swims there). That did not stop us from sailing with Lagenda Sightseeing Cruise, marveling at some of the city’s flamboyant landmarks, many of which were built in 1896 to commemorate the 1000th anniversary of the Magyars’ arrival and to thumb their nose at their rivals, Vienna.
One of the most grandiose of these is the Fisherman’s Bastion, which is a misnomer since it has no fishermen, but rather, hundreds of tourists all jostling for the perfect picture. This Disney-like monument reclines atop a hill and is purely ornamental, rather than functional.
Its centerpiece, Matthias Church, is way older, dating back to the Middle Ages. It is the site of many royal marriages and coronations…and this is starting to sound like a very dry history lesson so we’ll stop here.
The kings lived nearby, in ated a female servant, salvation is only a short walk away).While I’d love to pay a visit to the king and swig Buda Castle, presumably for convenience (I mean, if he has killed a blood relative for the throne or impregn palinka with him, monarchy ended in 1918 and the royal residence has now been converted into a library and several museums.
The Hungarian Parliament, which was also built as part of the millennial celebrations, makes the Houses of Parliament in London look modest. We booked a guided tour, and were herded like cows around the opulent interior, bristling with hand-carved statues, ceiling frescoes and convenient workplace facilities like a post office, a clinic and — perhaps the most important of all — a hair salon (because God forbid one has a bad hair day during a parliament sitting).
But perhaps the most intimidating room of all was the dome hall, where two guards holding drawn sabres stood watch over the crown jewels. Because it must be incredibly tiresome to stand still and have tourists buzz around you like flies day in and day out, they were ready to flay anyone who gets too close — a poor lady got the fright of her life when a guards sprang into action, snarling and waving his weapon (which he no doubt sharpens every day) in her face.
Like, we get it dude, your life sucks. Stop taking it out on others.
We had our first taste of Hungarian food and liquor at the Great Market Hall, where mountains of fiery red and yellow paprika — used liberally in Hungarian cuisine, from soups to cakes — graced shopfronts, while salami and sausages made from mangalica, a traditional Hungarian delicacy made from a local woolly pig, dangle from the ceilings. There were also shops selling jars upon jars of pickled everything — including melons — and a bakery selling freshly made, piping hot strudels. I bought one stuffed with cottage cheese and it was beautiful.
After a satisfying round of made-in-China souvenir shopping upstairs, we sat down for lunch in Fakanal Etterem, one of the more expensive restaurants in the market hall. The place is as touristy as it gets, with Hungarian tasting platters and roving folk musicians, but the food — which came accompanied with some salty, spicy paprika paste — was enjoyable.
Heck, I was starting to develop a certain fondness for Hungarian grub when I boldly gulped down some Unicum.
Everything about the Unicum is offensive, from its name to its taste. But just as I was about to buy a one-way ticket out of Hungary to get as far away as possible from this liquor, I had some toltott kapozsta, or traditional meat-stuffed cabbages drenched in tomato sauce, and the world was right again.
We also dropped by the Belvarosi Piac, a smaller, more authentic farmer’s market. Locals come here to shop for local produce and eat in one of the handful of casual food stalls owned by renowned Budapest chefs upstairs.
Despite its unpronounceable name, MoszkvatéЯ is a solid Russian eatery specializing in street food versions of traditional Russian cuisine. You’d think the Russians were only good for two things — mobsters and matryoshka dolls — but, no, their pelmenyi topped with caviar and sour cream is every bit as deserving of our attention too.
It is said that you can’t leave Budapest without trying langos, a favorite snack among the locals. We came upon this deep-fried dough at a summer fair, and — after apologizing to our arteries — decided to have ours doused in sour cream and grated cheese. It tasted remarkably similar to ham chim peng, the Asian doughnut that was such a regular fixture in my not-so-great childhood.
We took a cue from the food tours that regularly drop by Callas Cafe and had tea and desserts there. Situated on Andressy Ut, Budapest’s very own Champs Elysees, this gorgeous restaurant serves Hungarian pastries in art deco surroundings. I helped myself to the opera cake, an elegant chocolate confection layered with mousse and wafer, and it was as beautiful as Maria Callas, the world famous soprano who inspired it.
It took me awhile to realize that my mother’s apartment — yes, she lives there — was located in the Jewish Quarter, where 70,000 Jews were forced to live during the Nazi occupation in 1944.
Whole communities were wiped out, but the place is experiencing a revival of Jewish culture, judging from the number of new kosher restaurants in the vicinity. We loved walking around this disheveled, graffiti-sprayed neighborhood, exploring its hidden courtyards and ruin pubs — without the children, of course. Hungary may be part of Europe, but it feels different, grittier and more exotic.
We also stopped by the Dohany Utca Synagogue, Europe’s largest synagogue. Its elegant Moorish facade, however, hides a grim history. Beside it, the Garden of Remembrance stood, a mass grave for murdered Jews. Some of the victims’ names were inscribed into the weeping willow memorial nearby.
And then there is the Raoul Wallenberg Memorial, named for the Swedish consul who saved tens upon thousands of Jews during World War II by smuggling them out of trucks bound for the detention camps and into safe houses. He was eventually arrested by the Soviets for espionage and died in a gulag. But what disturbs me is that real-life heroes like him aren’t as well-known or celebrated as Iron Man or Wolverine. Their faces have disappeared, swept away by the tide of history.
It’s like they never existed.
After the excitement of the baths, we preferred to indulge in some low-key fun and relaxation with the children. So we took a tram to Margaret Island, a peaceful, car-free recreational reserve wedged in middle of the Danube. Locals come here to bike, swim and generally get away from the bustling city.
I mean, what could possibly go wrong, right? Right?!
Well, the problem began when we rented an electric buggy to check out some ruins of a church. Instead of following us, our 3-year-old clambered onto the driver’s seat in front and stepped on the pedal — accidentally it seemed, because he began screaming for help when the car propelled forward for quite a distance….before crashing into a tree.
The boy, while inconsolable, survived with minor scrapes and bruises.
But yes, Budapest is beautiful. Just don’t expect relaxation to be part of the vocabulary when you’re holidaying with kids.
STAY
New York Palace, Autograph Collection This resplendent baroque-style hotel sits within walking distance of Budapest’s top sights. Amenities include a gym, spa and pool. The in-house New York cafe has long been an institution, thanks to visiting poets and writers. Rooms are tastefully furnished, with large bathrooms, but do not that it can be quite noisy as the hotel sits at a busy intersection. Be sure to ask for a quieter room on a higher floor if you’re a light sleeper. $$$

Travel tips & guides on inspiring destinations

Hi guys, I’ve decided to continue writing my travel stories on my personal blog website “Wandering Sten” for easier access for everyone. There is no need to create an account and sign in as well as monthly reading limits. Click here to read Discovering Budapest and Beyond in a Month.
It’s my first time traveling to Europe and my first destination is Budapest, the capital city of Hungary. I spent about a month here and there’s so much to say about this Hungarian capital and the country that I don’t think I can fit everything in a single post. But I’ll share a brief and informative overview of my memorable experience living in Budapest and visiting other places in Hungary.
It may be Europe, and it may be part of the European Union but it’s still an affordable city to live in. With some tricks and a diligent search on accommodation across various platforms (best if you have a local to help you find accommodation), you can find a nice place to live without breaking the bank. At the time of visiting, I was working remotely and that means my job doesn’t require me to be in a specific geographic location. I can do it anywhere from my laptop as long as I have a reliable internet connection and luckily Hungary is a developed country with excellent infrastructure including high-speed internet access everywhere.
I love Budapest and all of Hungary in general. I know people have different opinions and have said different things about the city or the nation, but personally, my time there was amazing. The people are friendly to me, the food is amazing, and it’s just a beautiful country all around. To be fair, I had a wonderful guide to show me around and help me with so many things. So whenever possible, I suggest you try to mingle with the locals or go on guided tours by the locals to get the full experience.
I visited Budapest and some other cities back in August 2017 and I’ve come back again for another two months towards the end of that year. I’ve personally visited and experienced everything that I’ve written here and all other facts and tips are thoroughly updated and checked. I plan to visit Hungary again soon and will update this guide accordingly.
Budapest is divided into districts and they are 23 of them. Some of the most popular districts to live in are district 5 which is called Belváros (which means downtown in Hungarian), districts 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, and 1 (Castle district on the Buda side). You can find most of the main tourist attractions in District 5 such as the dazzling Országház or the Hungarian Parliament Building, St Stephen’s Basilica, Shoes on the Danube monument, and the Chain Bridge. However, each district has its characteristics and charms so if you have more time check out other districts as well.
As for pricing, the accommodation in the innercity ranging from 150,000–200,000 Hungarian Forint/month (435–580 Euros) for a 1-bedroom apartment. If you don’t mind living on the outskirts of the city center, let say 20–30 minutes by public transport, you can still find cheaper accommodation ranging from 90,000–120,000 HUF month (260–350 EUR) for a 1-bedroom apartment. For my first visit to Budapest, I stayed in Frangepán ut. which is in District 13 and it’s less than 20 minutes to downtown and I also stayed in Újpest, District 4 and is a quiet and safe residential area located just 30 minutes to downtown Budapest by the public transport.
Another nice thing about Budapest is they have a really good and affordable public transport system. The network is made up of busses, trams, four underground metro lines, water busses, and suburban railways. A one-way ticket costs about 350 HUF(1 EUR) and the monthly pass costs about 9500 HUF (28 EUR).
There’s a funicular with great views that you can take for a ride up to the castle district from Clark Adam Ter. It’s not included in the regular public transport ticket but you can purchase the tickets at the entrances on the way up and down for 1200 HUF (3.5 EUR). During Christmastime, there’s an illuminated tram overlooking the Danube river and the Buda Castle that runs along the Pest riverfront, all the way from Jászai Mari tér by Margaret Bridge to Közvágóhíd. The tram is decorated in beautiful Christmas lights and it’s such a unique experience to ride in the tram. You don’t need to pay extra to ride on the Christmas tram as you can use your standard ticket fares and passes.
The first thing that I noticed when I walk around Budapest is the architecture. The whole city is filled with beautiful buildings from different historical eras in Europe such as Baroque, Art Nouveau, Bauhaus, and Socialist. All the sightseeing attractions also not far from each other and can be reached within walking distance. Here’s the list of places that I think you can’t miss while you’re visiting Budapest:
This is probably the most iconic landmark in Budapest if not the whole of Hungary. Home to hundreds of parliamentary offices, the building is a sight to behold in every angle but the best full view is from the other side of the Danube river. Certain parts of the Parliament Building is open for guided tours daily and you get to see the great vaulted hall, the richly decorated central staircase, the Hungarian Crown Jewels, and the Hungarian Holy Crown.
Heroes’ Square is another iconic monument in Budapest. You will see big statues of the Seven Chieftains of Magyar and other important Hungarian national leaders as well as the 36 m high Corinthian column in the middle of the square with Archangel Gabriel on its top holding St. Stephen’s Crown.
Just behind the Heroes’ Square, there’s the Budapest City Park, a lovely park with lots of leafy walkways for strolls with friends and family. In the area, you’ll find the gorgeous Harry-Potter-like Vajdahunyad Castle — Museum of Hungarian Agriculture and not far from it, Budapest’s most famous and picturesque thermal bath Széchenyi Bath and Budapest Zoo & Botanical Gardens.
Also known as the Great Market Hall, this is a lively and large indoor market that is popular among tourists and locals. The three-story hall is massive in size and looks grandeur from the outside. Come here to browse among the stalls and counters selling seasonal produces, freshly-baked pogácsa (the Hungarian scone), various salamis, lángos, truffle paté, pickles, gourmet jams (plum, lavender), and souvenirs.
It is a small island covered in parkland and recreational facilities situated in the middle of the Danube river. Although quite small in size, it has some medieval ruins, a small zoo, gardens, musical fountains, a water park, playgrounds, running track, swimming pools and even dance clubs! This lovely green island is a great spot for hanging out with friends and located just a few throws away from downtown Budapest. Come here for jogging, picnic with friends and family, or simply taking a romantic stroll with your special one! ;)
This is an elegant avenue connecting the downtown with Heroes’ Square and City Park. It’s almost identical to the upscale Parisian boulevards in Paris and for that reason, you can find many luxury shops and high-end restaurants on this street. Other popular attractions such as the beautiful Hungarian State Opera and House of Terror Museum also located on Andrássy Avenue.
Overlooking the Danube river and across the Pest side of the city, Buda Castle is probably Budapest’s crown jewel. This world heritage site is located in the Castle District/Hill, here you can also find the Royal Palace, Fishermen’s Bastion, and Matthias Church — all are beautiful sightseeing spots that you can’t miss while in Budapest. The entire district is well-preserved (some of it dated back to the Medieval era) and as you strolled the cobblestone walkways, you can find lovely old houses, museums, cozy cafes and restaurants, even do wine tasting in historic Faust Wine Cellar. For the best panoramic view of the city, head to the Fishermen’s Bastion and don’t forget to check out the Castle Bazaar and Royal Gardens for seasonal events and more dining options.
Another great spot for panoramic views of Budapest is Gellért Hill. It’s a 140-meters high dolomite rock hill located by the Danube river on the Buda side of the city. Especially popular for weekend outings, the hill is filled with trees and you can hike on its winding trails that lead up to a Citadella where the Liberty Statue stands.
One of my most favorite things to do in Budapest is trying all different kinds of food and drinks. Forget the stereotypical bland western cuisines here, Hungary has many delicious authentic dishes and Budapest, in general, has a diverse and vibrant dining scene. Though not so popular in comparison to France and Italy, Hungary also produce great quality wines and I loved them! Here’s a list of some food that I’ve tried and loved while in Budapest:
Fun fact: Lángos is the first thing that I ate when I arrived in Budapest and what a good starter it is! Considered as Hungary’s best street food, it’s a fluffy fried dough covered in cheese and other toppings such as sour cream, bacon, onion, and parsley. It’s so delicious and satisfying and you can find Lángos easily in food kiosks, cafes, or restaurants everywhere in Hungary. My favorite place to buy Lángos is from a food kiosk just by the entrance of Lehel Csarnok (Lehel Market) which is a well-known local indoor market. Prices vary depending on where you buy it and whether you have additional topping or not but generally it costs around 350–700 HUF (1–2 EUR).
This is one of the most celebrated and iconic dishes in Hungarian culinary. There are many versions of Goulash whether it’s regional or international, but essentially, it’s a rich stew made from beef (or veal and pork), potato, carrot, spices, and the world-famous Hungarian paprika. It’s a highly fulfilling and flavorful dish that you have to try when visiting Hungary.
This is another of my favorite Hungarian dish and it’s unique. It is a thick vegetable stew made from variations of lentils, potato, peas, beans, or carrot simmered and thickened by flour mixed with sour cream. I imagined this is a typical home-cooked meal for Hungarians and they’re also really easy to make. My favorite is the green-colored peas Főzelék and goes well with bread, you can find this healthy but fulfilling dish in most restaurants in Hungary.
Okay, in my opinion, all the cakes that I’ve tasted in Hungary are delightful but if I must pick one I’d choose Dobos Torte. It’s a moist sponge cake layered with chocolate buttercream and topped with caramel; it’s heavenly! Hungary has a sweet tradition of holding the annual national cake contest where each year during St. Stephen’s Day on August 20th, they pick the best cake and crown it as the “Cake of Hungary.” The recipe for the winning cake then shared with the general public and you can find the cake in almost every dessert shop, cafes, and restaurants in Hungary.
If you can’t remember how to pronounce the name of this pastry that’s okay because you’ll remember how it tastes (and made). Kürtöskalács or the Chimney Cake is a Hungarian treasure in a form of a sweet spiral strip that is spun and then wrapped around a truncated cone baked over charcoal and coated in plenty of sugar while basted with melted butter until its surface cooks to a delectable golden-brown color. How does that sound? Yummy! If you’re extra like me, you can also add additional toppings such as cinnamon, cocoa, shredded coconut (my favorite because I’m tropical), or chopped walnuts and they elevate this famous Hungarian street pastry.
Let’s talk about wines! Hungary is not as well-known in comparison to France, Italy, or the Americas in terms of wines but that’s unfortunate because they have a really good selection of red and white wines that are produced locally. Here are some of them; Egri Bikavér or Bull’s Blood (my favorite) is a bold and dry red wine originated from Eger in northern Hungary, Tokaji Aszú or King of Wines is a famous dessert wine from Tokaji region that’s sweet and can be found in most restaurants in Hungary. Another drink that you can try is Pálinka which is not a wine, but a fruit brandy originated in Hungary and also popular throughout central Europe.
Although I loved Budapest, I was lucky enough to venture beyond the capital for a bit and went to Vác and Eger; two equally fun and memorable destinations to visit! Firstly, there’s Vác which is a great and quick getaway from Budapest that’s often overlooked. The quiet riverside town has enough attractions for a day-trip from Budapest and I loved my visit here. Some places to visit are the Vác Cathedral; a big beautiful church from the Baroque era built in the 11th century, the City Hall, White Church, strolling around the quaint main square and the riverside walkways, or simply checking out local restaurants and dessert shops.
Eger is well-known for its wines, natural thermal baths, and some historical landmarks. The city is beautiful and a unique blend of Christian and Turkish cultures which is visible in its architecture. While you’re here, don’t forget to visit Eger Castle & Museum, the Main Square, Minorite Church, Archbishop’s Garden, Turkish Minaret, and if you have time, definitely go to the Eger Thermal Bath (my favorite part of Eger!) and experience the healing sensation of Hungarian thermal bath. Another great spot to visit while you’re in Eger is Szépasszonyvőlgy or The Valley of the Beautiful Maidens, a popular venue for wine tasting that has below the surface rows of wine cellars where you can drink and buy some of Hungary’s best wines.
If you haven’t been to Budapest, you need to give it a go. Hungary’s capital is often overlooked because many people choose other popular destinations such as Paris, Rome, or Amsterdam. Although it has its flaws, I am so glad that my first European city is Budapest because I love the characteristics and the overall vibes. There are still so many things that I’d love to write about my travel to Budapest and surrounding cities (like my visit to the city of Debrecen, and bar/club hopping experience in Budapest). But I’ll save it for another blog post! ;)
Let me know if you have any questions or comments, I’d be happy to help you to have a great experience as you plan to travel to Budapest.

often there will be loads of empty seats but no-one sits in them, even when the tram is busy and all the less-able-to-stand people are sitting! I haven’t figured this one out yet.
is expected in any cafe, and some restaurants. it’s nice to be helpful!
they don’t switch to English, even if you speak it VERY badly. which is great when you want to practise. but potentially embarrassing… yesterday a barman got grumpy with me because I ordered two pints of Dreher (the local beer) but he somehow thought I meant two shots of whiskey, and then he wasn’t happy because he had to pour the shots back into the bottle… oops.
watch where you walk – or you’ll get dripped on.
no broccoli in any of the supermarkets. I’ve seen a couple of them hiding at fruit & veg markets, but never in any of the supermarkets. sad me 🥦
and even if it is broke, still don’t fix it. just put it in the hallway of your apartment block and you can guarantee someone’ll have nabbed it within the hour.
a lot of the greetings mean both hello and goodbye. which means you might hear “szia!” (pronounced like see ya) for hello, and “hallo!” for goodbye. not confusing at all.
made of actual wicker! and it’s not only the old ladies that use them – many other people do, too.
or any other type of coffee. they are just regular bars (without the espresso). also, loads of coffee shops also sell wine and cocktails and stay open til the evening. I like this.

Nearly ten years ago, my husband and I lived in Budapest for a few months right after we were married. Every weekend, we’d pack our bags and visit a new European town or country. That was when the travel bug bit us. Fast forward to today, we were thrilled to have a wonderful opportunity to visit Budapest again. How could we possibly say no? This time, we wanted to take our son to the places where we made wonderful memories ten years ago. And of course, when you’re in Europe, visiting one city isn’t always enough. That’s how Bratislava and Vienna ended up on our itinerary as well.
Flights
First things first. To apply for a visa, you need confirmed round-trip tickets and hotel reservations for the travel dates. I know I’ve mentioned this before in my Kazakhstan blog, but it’s always worth repeating — look for cheaper flights from cities other than the one you reside in. We could have booked flights directly from Kozhikode to Budapest. But the layovers were long, which made the total travel time even longer, and the ticket prices were outrageous! The cheapest flight to Budapest from India was from Bangalore. The flight duration was shorter, and the layovers were minimal. So, we booked our flights from Bangalore. We flew to Bangalore from Kozhikode the day before and stayed overnight at a hotel near the airport. This turned out to be cheaper than booking a direct flight from Kozhikode (including both the flights to Bangalore and the hotel stay). And since we have a kid, it was much more convenient for him. Happy child = Happy Parents. It was a win-win. We booked the KLM flight from Bangalore to Budapest with a 1.5-hour layover in Amsterdam. We flew back to Bangalore from Budapest via Paris on Air France. Both flights were quite comfortable, and we had no complaints.
Stay
From our experience, Airbnb is the best stay option. It is cheaper than hotels and extremely spacious, and most rentals have a washer/dryer. That means you can carry fewer clothes and sleep in spacious rooms. Our son is a huge fan of Airbnb because of how spacious they are. Hotels simply cannot beat this offer. Of course, make sure you book an Airbnb rental with good ratings located near the city centre or one that is easily accessible via public transport.
Once our flights and accommodations were booked, the next step — the most dreaded of them all — was applying for a Schengen visa.
Schengen Visa
Let me be upfront — of all the visas I’ve applied for, the Schengen visa is the most complicated. I’m not joking when I say that one of the factors influencing the choice of our travel destinations is the complexity of the visa application process. All the countries we’ve visited in the past few years (post-COVID) have either had straightforward visa applications or were visa-free. But when the opportunity to travel back to Budapest came up around our ten-year wedding anniversary, we couldn’t say no, especially since we started our married life there.
I’m not going to go into detail about the visa application process, but I will mention a few things that helped us during our process.
To apply for a Schengen visa, you must submit your documents to the VFS application centre closest to your city of residence. We live in Kozhikode, and the nearest VFS centre that processes Schengen visas is in Kochi. However, we couldn’t find any suitable appointment dates in Kochi, so we decided to go with the next closest VFS centre — Bangalore. Coincidentally, we were planning a trip to Mysore during the Navratri holidays, so we extended our holiday to fit the visa appointment in Bangalore.
Before COVID-19, applying for a Schengen visa was simpler because we didn’t need an agent to help us block appointment dates. We could just log into our account on the VFS portal and pick the city, date, and time that suited us. This time, however, we couldn’t get any appointment dates when we tried to do it ourselves. It was disappointing because we took pride in managing our travel plans independently. In the end, we had to approach an agent to book an appointment, and to our surprise and eventual relief, the agent was able to get us dates that appeared unavailable on the portal. We finally got our dates, and they lined up perfectly with our Mysore holiday.
When you go for your visa appointment, it’s a good idea to bring extra documents beyond those listed on the VFS website. We carried copies of our marriage certificate, our son’s birth certificate, copies of our investments, all our old passports, and copies of all Schengen visas older than three years — documents that were not specifically required, but which the VFS centre appreciated us having. The VFS centre also has a photo booth (in case your photos don’t meet their standards), photocopy machines, and printers, just in case you forget to bring a document. So, it’s helpful to keep digital copies of all your documents so you can easily access and print them if needed.
We received our passports stamped with the visas within a few days of application.
Now, it was time to travel!
Our First Destination — Budapest
Although Amsterdam was our first port of entry into Europe, it was a short layover. After waiting through a long immigration line, we rushed to catch our connecting flight to Budapest.We reached Budapest at around 12 PM. Since we finished our immigration at our first port of entry — Amsterdam — we collected our luggage and passed through customs. We were to stay in Budapest for five days, visit Bratislava and Vienna, and then return to Budapest for a day before flying back to India. So, we purchased a two-week travel pass at the airport. This pass provides unlimited use of public transport (metro, bus, and tram) for 14 days in Budapest. There are also single tickets, one-day passes, three-day passes, and monthly travel passes, but sadly, no weekly passes. The two-week pass worked out to be the cheapest option for our 6-day overall stay. If you plan to stay in Budapest for more than three days, get the two-week pass. Don’t buy a three-day pass and then single-day passes for the extra days, as the price difference between the three-day and two-week passes is minimal. If you buy single tickets each time you use public transport, you’ll lose both time and money. One thing you should know about most European cities is that you will rarely need to use a taxi/cab. The public transport system is so well-connected that you’ll be constantly hopping on and off metros, buses, or trams throughout your stay. So, a travel pass makes more sense than individual tickets. Also, think of the time you’ll save. Imagine having to purchase a ticket every time you use public transportation. It simply does not make sense.
With the travel pass, we took the 200E bus to Kőbánya-Kispest M and then transferred to the M3 Metro line to get closer to our accommodation. We stayed in an Airbnb just a three-minute walk from Kalvin Square (Kálvin Tér) Metro station (this falls on the M3 metro line).
There is also a 100E bus that goes directly from the airport to the city centre, but this is the only transport service that is NOT included in the travel pass. Since we had the pass, we skipped it and took the 200E bus instead. The 200E bus stops just outside the airport exit. You don’t need to validate your two-week pass on the bus, but make sure to keep it with you at all times. There are regular checks, and you’ll need to show your pass if asked. Once we reached Kőbánya-Kispest M, we transferred to the M3 metro line and travelled to Kálvin Tér. At metro stations, there are no automated ticket validators. Instead, you’ll need to show your pass to the staff member near the escalators, who will quickly scan it before letting you through.
We reached our metro station, walked to our Airbnb, and self-checked in. After that, we took the day off to relax.
Getting a Local Sim
We made sure our international roaming was activated before we left India. We needed data for the first hours around the city since we did not want to buy a SIM card at the airport (expensive). We visited a local Vodafone store in the city the very next day and bought a local SIM. It was around INR 2500, which got us 6 GB of data for 30 days around Europe.
Sightseeing in Budapest
We travelled in November, which meant it was cold and there were fewer tourists — which worked to our advantage. However, the drawback was that we had to layer up every time we stepped out, which was frustrating the first few days, but later, we got used to it. We had three layers. Our regular clothes, a sweatshirt/sweater on top and a final jacket. We also had gloves, a scarf, and a beanie. We used regular walking shoes, which were quite enough since there was no snow or rain.
Places we visited in Budapest –
As with most of my travel blogs, I’m not going to dive into the details of our itinerary or write in detail about the places we visited. Instead, I’m going to simply list the places we explored each day. We traveled with our 4-year-old son, so if you’re wondering how many places you can cover with a kid in a day, this should give you a good idea.
Day 1 –
1. Hungarian Parliament Building Viewpoint
2. Mathias Church
3. Fishermen’s Bastion
4. Buda Castle and Old Town
5. Szechenyi Chain Bridge
Day 2 –
1. Gellert Hill (Closed due to renovation)
2. Vaci Utca — for shopping
3. Corvinus University
Day 3 –
1. Shoes on the Danube Bank
2. Central Market
3. Vajdahunyad Castle
4. Heroes Square
Day 4 –
1. Ferris Wheel of Budapest
2. Vaci Utca for the second time
3. Christmas Markets around the city
Day 5 –
Budapest to Bratislava
Our Second Destination — Bratislava
Our next stop was the city of Bratislava in Slovakia. We didn’t book any local travel in advance, so we visited the Keleti-Pályaudvar railway station in Budapest, a few stops away from where we stayed, and bought our train tickets to Bratislava just the day before leaving for Bratislava. This worked out cheaper for us. We also reserved seats by paying a little extra. This may not be necessary during the off-season because the trains are quite empty, and you can choose any seat, but during peak season, I suggest reserving seats. Kids under 6 travel for free! It took us 2.5 hours to reach Bratislava by train from Budapest.
We were staying in Bratislava for three days, so we bought the three-day travel pass at the railway station. The pass gives you unlimited bus and tram rides within the city. There is no metro in Bratislava, but trams and buses connect the station to the city centre. Make sure to validate your pass during your first ride. Once validated, it’s enough to do it just once, as the three days are counted from your first trip.
We stayed in an Airbnb very close to St. Michael’s Gate. The city is much smaller than Budapest, and most sightseeing within the city can be done on foot. However, visiting Devin Castle takes about 40 minutes by bus. You can use your travel pass for the bus ride there.
Places we visited –
1. Devin Castle (must visit for breathtaking views of the Danube) — Highly Recommended
2. Bratislava City Centre — St Stephen’s Gate, UFO tower, Bratislava castle
Our Third Destination — Vienna
We travelled from Bratislava to Vienna by bus. Again, we booked the bus tickets just the day before we left for Vienna. We did this online and took the Slovak Lines bus to Vienna Bus station. Remember, there are two stops in Vienna. The bus first stops at the airport and then at the central station. Make sure you book your tickets to the central station, not the airport. We were in Vienna for only a day and took the day pass at a metro station near the bus station where we were dropped off. The return buses back to Bratislava also leave from the same station.
Places we visited in Vienna –
1. Stephensplatz and St. Stephen’s Cathedral
Our Vienna tradition is to have Gelato in Stephensplatz and so, that’s what we did. We went to a place — Zanoni and Zanoni — that had Vegan gelato and also vegan Pizza. They also had egg-free chocolate croissants. We finished a quick lunch here and spent the rest of the day looking around Vienna.
2. Hofburg Palace
3. Maria Theresa Square
4. Christmas Markets
5. Belvedere Palace
We left Bratislava on the 19th and reached Budapest. On the last day in Budapest, we simply walked around Kalvin Square, did some shopping, and called it a day. On the morning of the 20th, we boarded the flight back to Bangalore.
Travel within Europe
Within the cities, we never used a Taxi. The airports are very well connected to the city centre by public transport (Metro, Bus and Tram). If you can walk, you won’t need a cab/taxi during any part of your journey. The cities are well connected by public transport.
For kids under 6, public transport was FREE in all three cities!
About Europe in General
Please be aware of your surroundings and do not fall for tourist scams. So far, the central and eastern European countries we’ve visited (Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia, Croatia) are not particularly known for scams. However, scams are more common in places like Italy, France, and Belgium — especially in capital cities and other popular tourist spots. There are several blogs online that discuss the various scams you may encounter, so please read up and stay informed before you travel. Scammers often try to distract you with something (such as asking you to sign a petition or attempting to give you a “free” gift), and while you’re distracted, another member of their group may pickpocket you or steal your bags.
Once in Paris, near Montmartre, we were approached by a girl who asked us to sign a petition for something. This is one of their most common scams. Our advice: just walk away and keep a tight grip on your bags. Also, don’t keep your phone or wallet in your pant pockets. Aravind was almost pickpocketed once but caught the girl in the act, and she quickly ran away. Luckily, he didn’t lose his wallet. The first incident happened in Paris, and the second in Rome. A third incident happened in Athens, where a lady approached me and offered me a free rose. Thankfully, I said no and left. It was only later that I realized this is another popular scam where people offer you free gifts, and once you accept them, they’ll ask for something in return. We encountered no such scams in the three cities we visited this time.
As for food, many vegan eateries can be found in the popular cities if you want to try local cuisine. In Budapest, I suggest you try Napfenyes Etterem — a vegan restaurant that serves local Hungarian cuisine. Make sure you try the Goulash soup! There are also plenty of Indian restaurants if you’re craving Indian food. We always look for Govinda’s — ISKCON’s restaurant. They have branches in several cities and if a city we’re travelling to has one, that’s where we frequent because our son prefers Indian food to local cuisine.
Overall, Europe is always a fantastic travel destination (if you manage to overcome the initial visa hurdle) because once you enter Europe, you have free reign to go anywhere, and everything is so well connected. Also, almost every shop closes by 6 pm. So make sure to do your shopping before then!
Happy travels!

Budapest was my last trip abroad before Covid hit and I’ve been missing these trips terribly. I’ve been traveling inside my own country for the past two years and I’m happy I’m privileged enough to do it despite this whole Covid mess, but I feel something is missing, so maybe writing and sharing will alleviate the itch.
Budapest was on my bucket list since I started a bucket list of places to visit and oh my… I only regret not staying for longer! Budapest is such a beautiful city with so many amazing places to visit and views that you could spend hours just admiring, specially at night when everything is illuminated.
Here goes my itinerary, information about the places I visited, the places I recommend for eating and the useful tips I wish someone had gave me.
I stayed at the Hotel Memories OldTown and I totally recommended it. The location is great, there are bus and tram stops just around the corner, and one of the main bus stops that connects to the airport is located 2min from the hotel (Kálvin tér M). Even though the hotel is located near a very busy street, most rooms face a totally quiet one, so no trouble sleeping. Breakfast was great, with options for all tastes, all fresh and some homemade. Room was big, super comfortable bed and all the typical amenities. There’s a spa center at the hotel with sauna, jacuzzi…

“Almost dead yesterday, maybe dead tomorrow, but alive, gloriously alive, today.” — Robert Jordan, Lord of Chaos
I stepped off the busy burnt-yellow streetcar into a crisp grey late November evening. The bustle so prevalent throughout the centre of Budapest had ebbed away by the time I arrived at my stop. Now it just seemed like a sleepy Sunday afternoon in a small town. We were in Jozsefvaros, or the 8th district of the city, where we had arranged for an overnight staycation in a spa hotel.
We walked towards the hotel as my wife, who had grown up in Budapest, excitedly pointed out the high school she went to almost two decades before, which stood on a square just across from the hotel. It was beautiful in its old-world charm, as was the hotel which had recently been renovated but which originally served as a telecommunications office in the early twentieth century.
As we settled down in our room, I came across a coffee table book bearing black and…

Updated March 2024
Books to read:
Quick geography lesson:
Buda: on the hilly, leafy west side of the Danube river. The foothills have some apartment buildings… further up it’s full of glam villas. Traditionally more Catholic/royalist.
Pest: the flat, east side of the Danube. Full of apartment buildings, gritty side streets and broad avenues. Traditionally more Jewish, cosmopolitan and socialist.
Food and drink (mostly Pest):
Transport:
Trams are an ideal way to see the city, particularly #2 along the Pest side of the river and #6, which circles the ring road. DO buy a ticket, and, as in all tourist-engorged cities, do watch your wallet.
BOLT is a great app for affordable taxis. You can input start/end points and avoid trying to speak Hungarian. Works elsewhere in Central Europe too.
Buda/Pest highlights:
The “Castle District” on the west side of the Danube (Buda) is full of faux medieval architecture, monarchist pretense… skip it if your time is short. If you want to experience a fun conglomeration of scenes, start at the Bambi coffee shop (straight out of 1962), walk up the hill to Szell Kalman Ter (used to be Moszkva Ter, the tram hub where kids gathered during the 70s and 80s to plot their night escapades) to see the Mammut Mall (modern, erected on the site of an old train factory), the Fenyi Utcai Piac (farmer’s market in a modern/brutalist setting) and have a coffee at a cafe along the pedestrian Lovohaz utca and eat at Pingrumba (mentioned above.) From here, you can grab a #6 tram to head over to Pest…
Random stuff on the east (Pest) side is better. A quick tour below… if you start at roughly 12 o’clock on the clock dial, this zigzags around to 6 o’clock. Most of this stuff — with the exception of the city market — is within 5–10 minutes walk of other points.
Budapest, the melting pot:
Pronunciation:
After returning from Hungary, should you talk about your visit to “Budapesht” (mimicking Hungarian, which turns “s” into “sh”) or “Budapest” (phonetically in English)? Many tourists affect the former pronunciation — which is odd, because almost nobody talks about their trips to “Paree” or “Roma,” right? (I confront the same problem when referring to Indianapolis, which residents universally call “Indy,” when I’m outside in Indiana.)

And a friend’s notes on Prague. Notes on Budapest’s rising prices for tourists. Online resources: LikeLocals.

It’s been a few days since we left the city of Budapest but since we’re still on the road roaming through Transylvania, writing articles takes me longer than usual. And so does editing videos.
We’ve taken lots of footage on this trip so far and I decided to break up the clips. Here’s the video now of our first part of the journey.
And in case you didn’t read the articles about our stay in the city you can do it now.

Budapest is only one hour flight from Frankfurt. I have heard so many great reviews of the city that I decided it was time to visit the capital of Hungary.
Jacob had a birthday on the 10th of October and I decided to surprise him by flying with him to Budapest for three days. Turned out, it was a fantastic present for both of us.
In the BUD airport, I withdrew local forints from an ATM, bought my 3-day Budapest public transportation ticket, and off we went to the city center by bus.
It turned out the only time I needed cash was when I used city toilets. All the restaurants, cafes, museums, and parking garages accept credit cards.
On the second thought, we found another use for unspent forints. More about it in the next story about the city.😉
Our apartment was located in a beautiful and grandiose building erected at the beginning of the 20th century, at the time when modern Hungary was a part of the powerful Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.
The apartment was located in a mostly flat Pest part of the capital, just 10 minutes walking distance away from the Hungarian Parliament building. From there, we could enjoy fantastic views of the hilly Buda and Obuda parts of the city, located across the Danube River.

It’s the first of October and I’m in one of the most beautiful cities in all of Europe. I walked nearly 20 miles today through 2,000 years of history: through the overthrow of kingdoms and empires, the fall of communism, the rise of capitalism, the evidence of centuries-old glitz, and the stories of human survival and defeat… and through it all, Budapest (pronounced Boo-da-pesht) has held its head high.
The bus ride from the airport last night took me past lights illuminating modern outlet malls. Giant billboards stood above a newly paved highway for Pizza Hut, NewYorker clothing, a Mercedes dealer, mattress stores and diamond merchants. Was this right? Had I just landed in Hungary? I was expecting sturdy grandmothers, about as wide as they were high, slinging potato sacks into communist-built trucks, clothed in brown, and selling unevenly carved salt blocks on the side of a dirt road. But this looked like I was riding past a strip mall in middle America.
We left the outskirts and were soon in the city proper: Baroque, Gothic, Classical and Art Nouveau architecture… it was like Prague, only the streets were wider and the buildings a touch more opulent. We pulled into downtown, and what I’d later learn to be the Pes(shh)t side of the city where a giant white Ferris wheel, a replica of the London Eye, stood next to the Danube River and a purple-lit Chain Bridge.
I exited the bus and walked down a narrow cement canyon made up of 5-story high buildings. Drunk college kids staggered and laughed in packs, weaving their way down the sidewalk. It was a Monday, but may as well have been a Saturday night- it was like walking through the East Village in Manhattan. Graffiti was scribbled on old decaying buildings, giving it that mysterious post-communist look. Dark alleyways and shuttered store fronts looked like part of an intended stage set. Kids covered in tattoos smoked cigarettes in doorways and wandered into crumbling ‘Ruin’ bars (pop-up bars with antique furniture and communist paraphernalia in abandoned buildings) before hitting the late-night pizza parlors, pianos bars, or even taco stands. I’d later learn I was just a few blocks from the big tourist draw of Saint Stephen’s Cathedral, down from the Four Seasons, the Ritz, and the Parliament. Luxury was mixed with disintegrating alleyways; it was all part of the city’s pallet.
I found my Air BnB, after having walked past it twice, tucked away between a furniture store and a construction site, located on one of the uprooted side streets in the Jewish Quarter. The cement walls on the exterior and in the open courtyard were crumbling, a patchwork of grey filler smeared the walls in no particular pattern. Chicken wire caged the mineshaft-like elevator, which was surrounded by a spiral staircase. There was a central area between the buildings that opened to the sky where trash was kept and laundry hung from railings. Red ivy cascaded alongside large cracks that ran the building like deep scars: another perfect backdrop for an East Berlin spy movie and no wonder it was $35 a night.
The inside of the apartment, though, could have been a museum: 2 old-fashioned typewriters, an antique sewing machine, gilded mirrors, fedoras hanging from walls, and half a canoe posing as a bookshelf. The place was big, maybe 800sq ft, with 12’ ceilings. During the day, light would pour in from double-paned windows and every once in awhile there would be a burst of pigeons, like fireworks over the rooftops, visible through the windows. In the living room, old wooden oars hung curtains and in the bathroom, antique golf clubs hung towels.
I looked down at my phone to see how many miles I had clocked walking through the city that day: 19.3. No wonder I was exhausted. Making my way into the apartment, I searched for anything edible in the old-fashioned kitchen. A bar of chocolate and an apple were propped up against an Italian espresso Moka Pot. Caffeine, an apple, and more caffeine? It looked like it was time to track down some authentic Hungarian cousine… would pizza count?
The night before I had ridden the massive white ferris wheel to get a view of the city from above, then photographed the beautifully lit Chain Bridge. I grabbed pizza (it rivaled New York City’s) and ice cream and sat watching the crowds flow in and out of the square in front of Saint Stephen’s Cathedral.
I read somewhere that this city can be substituted in films for Moscow, Paris, Berlin, Rome, and even Buenos Aires. 4 historical periods are visible in the architecture, including 1st Century Roman ruins next to Buda Castle and medieval buildings at one of the bath houses. The city just feels familiar- like I’ve been here before and have been waiting unknowingly to come back.
In the morning, I went for a run over to the Buda side where the Buda Castle is. The lush rolling hills of Buda (previously a separate city from Pest) includes gorgeous lookouts of the city from Fisherman’s Bastion: neo-Romanesque architecture with a view of the Parliament across the Danube. I did a 3hr historical (free) walking tour later and learned that Hungarians prefer the term Central Europe, not Eastern Europe; that post-communism is a mixture between democracy and communism; that the Turks brought the bath houses, coffee houses, and even paprika here over 500 years ago; that the Austro-Hungarian empire (post 1867) had a shared capital between Vienna and Budapest. (Each city tried to outdo the other in architecture and panache resulting in a building boom that made most of the city’s grandiose buildings of today.) And interestingly, 70% of Europe’s gold is from Hungary, which may explain the demand for the region and its prosperity.
I wandered back and forth over the 3 bridges, visiting the Parliament and an art instillation from 2005 called Shoes on the Danube River (a memorial of shoes left behind by Jews during WWII who were shot into the Danube. The shoes had been worth more than the people and they’d been instructed to remove them ahead of time). Learning about historical tragedies like these (over 600,000 Jews were killed in Hungary during WWII) and the rise and fall of the many kingdoms, empires, and modern governments had me in a trance, the crunch of pebbles under my feet, the feel of the leather shoes against my fingers. I stared across the river to the Buda side with its rolling hills and castles, the crisp fall air wrapping around me like a hug from an old friend.
As the sun dipped below the horizon, I made my way to the 1888 Baroque-style Turkish Baths at Széchenyiin City Park, my towel and swimsuit stuffed in my backpack. For the equivalent of $7, I had the use of all the mineral pools of varying temperatures from ice cold plunges to naturally hot pools, saunas and steam rooms. Faucets on ancient pipes in the sauna could be turned on to refill your water bottle, which reminded me of the fire hydrants around the city that also have a device allowing people to refill with delicious tap water. Water was flowing from everywhere, I had never seen anything quite like it.
When I got here 2 nights ago, I had known almost nothing about Budapest. I came because of a $49 airfare from Paris and a spare two days. Getting off that plane and riding into a worn yet opulent city that faces a fairy tale of castles and palaces across a winding river had me more fascinated than I expected; I knew immediately that 2 days wouldn’t be enough.
One thing I’m embarrassed about is that I didn’t experience Hungarian food. The immigrant cultures of Turkish and Italian were so prominent, with gyro shops and pizza restaurants everywhere, there wasn’t much of a draw to heavy Hungarian food. Still, I did learn the importance of Paprika (a mild pepper powder) in every dish- like in goulash (pronounced gulyas) and paprikash. Onions, garlic, potatoes, paprika and bacon make the basis for most Hungarian dishes, which run close to 3,000 calories per serving.
Another interesting tidbit is that the 500-year-old coffee culture, brought in by the Ottoman Empire, had created more than 400 cafes by the 19th Century. Intellectuals and writers would gather, chain smoking and waxing poetic in their caffeinated excitement. The culture was squashed by the communists after WWII, but it’s made a comeback since their independence in 1989. Coffee ‘take away’ and drip coffee isn’t very popular, so chains like Starbucks and McCafe have adjusted by serving espresso in china teacups.
As I rode the bus back out to the airport, a day and a half after my arrival, the scene looked more familiar in the light and more reasonable than my initial assessment. Of course there would be malls outside of this bustling city with English billboards- Hungarian is one of the top 5 most difficult languages in the world after all. With communism over, this country had sprung at the opportunity to connect with the capitalist west- and they play the part well.
Budapest, known as the Paris of the east, should be on everyone’s bucket list; I know I can’t wait to return.

Probably due to the fact I part time live in Hungary, I am often asked about Budapest. So here are my takes and suggestions!
Budapest is a big city with several district articles containing sightseeing, restaurant, nightlife and accommodation listings.Budapest (Hungarian pronunciation approximates to “boo-dah-pesht”) is the capital city of Hungary. With a unique, youthful atmosphere, a world-class classical music scene as well as a pulsating night life increasingly appreciated among European youth and, last but not least, an exceptionally rich offering of natural thermal baths, Budapest is one of Europe’s most delightful and enjoyable cities. Due to its scenic setting and its architecture it is nicknamed “Paris of the East”.
In 1987 Budapest was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List for the cultural and architectural significance of the Banks of the Danube, the Buda Castle Quarter and Andrássy Avenue.
I am obsessed by the Fisherman Bastion …in a photographic sort of way. The proximity with one of my favourite patisserie does the rest!
I know they are new, I know they do not mean or serve much I still love them!
Located in the historic district of Castle Hill, the Fisherman’s Bastion (or Halászbástya) is a neo-Gothic terrace that looks like a structure taken straight out of a fairytale. Designed and built between 1895 and 1902, next door — Fisherman’s Bastion is named after the medieval guild of fishermen who protected Budapest from invasion.
The gleaming white structure provides panoramic views of the city: From here, you can snap some breathtaking pictures of the Danube, Margaret Island and Pest. You may choose to take some time to explore the bastion’s seven ornate turrets, which symbolize the tents of the seven Magyar tribe leaders who settled the Carpathian Basin, ultimately leading to the existence of modern-day Hungary.
Andrassy Utca is one of the most beautiful avenues in Budapest. The big green trees and the high end fashion stores give it an elegant vibe. Very nice to walk along it.It is a lovely wide avenue for a stroll. There are lots of restaurants and international clothing chains, high end on the street. The Opera is here and on the day I was walking they were making a period movie. It was nice to watch. Several places for coffee and of course, the clothing chain COS is here. If you walk to the end you will pass the Terror House and wind up at the big city park with the zoo.
A soak in a thermal bath is a quintessential Budapest experience (it hasn’t cultivated a reputation as the “City of Spas” for nothing). These baths, or fürdok in Hungarian, are heated by natural thermal springs and usually include on-site massage services, as well as steam rooms. There is no other bath as the Széchenyi Baths!!! The Geller are pretty do not get me wrong but you can find similar or better anywere in the world!
SZÉCHENYI BATHS
One of the last remnants of the Turkish influence in Hungary, a visit to the thermal baths is a quintessential Budapest experience. I haven’t visited all of the baths in Budapest, but I have been to several of the most famous Budapest baths and the grandiose Széchenyi Baths are by far my favourite. Early morning or just before sunset is my favourite times for a soak in the thermal, healing waters of Széchenyi’s outdoor pools.
…and discover why Budapest is called the Pearl of the Danube!
Ah, the Chain Bridge — one of my very favourite bridges in the world. It was the first bridge to permanently connect Buda and Pest and was completed in 1849. At the time, the Chain Bridge was considered to be one of the wonders of the world and the architect was so immensely proud of his work that he challenged anyone to find fault with the bridge. It is said that when it was discovered that the lions that stand guard at either end are missing their tongues, the architect committed suicide.
The Great Market Hall in central Budapest is Budapest’s most famous marketplace.
Whilst many locals still use the market hall as a place to buy their groceries, the market is incredibly popular with the tourists too.
Locally grown fruits and veg, and locally sourced meats are found on the lower floors, and souvenirs including lace, chess sets and leather goods are available in the upper floors.
As well as individual ingredients, it is possible to pick up homemade local delicacies like goulash and langos from the food stall upstairs.
Budapest is full of cafes to have a delicious cuppa joe and try one of the sweets Budapest is famous for. Cafe Ruszwurm, on the Castle Hill, is one of Budapest’s oldest traditional confectioners still operating as a cafe.
it is very cosy and small, has just about a dozen seats, There is a wide selection of the day’s fresh pastries, truffles, and coffee concoctions to choose from. The decor is charming too with antique furniture and tools of the old confectionery trade in the glass curio cabinets.
Cafe Ruszwurm is located at Szentháromság u. 7 and is open 9am — 8pm Spring through Fall and 10am — 7pm in Winter.
Completed in 1904, the Hungarian Parliament Building is one of Budapest’s most famous landmarks. The National Assembly of Hungary still meets there to this day. Travelers come mainly to take in the building’s architecture (primarily Gothic Revival style), beautiful statues and paintings, and national significance. According to many, there is no structure in Hungary that serves as a better symbol of the country’s independence and commitment to democracy.
Heroes’ Square (or Hosök tere) is one of Budapest’s grandest landmarks as well as the largest public square in the city. Swing by this area to take a picture of the Millenium Monument which was erected in 1896 to celebrate Hungary’s 1000th anniversary.
The square and the monument are dedicated to “the memory of those heroes who gave their lives for the freedom of our people and our national independence.” At the base of the famous column (topped with the archangel Gabriel) are statues representing seven Magyar chieftains — considered to be the founders of the Hungarian nation. Behind the column are matching colonnades with 14 statues of royalty and other important figures in Hungarian history.
This funicular, which first opened in 1870, is the second oldest funicular of its kind in the world. A system of weights and counterweights is used to help to raise the carriages up and down the hill. The funicular is the fastest way to get to the top of Castle Hill, and is exceedingly popular because of its panoramic views out across the Danube. (You can also get there with this Segway tour)
The speed of ascent was actually slowed down as of 1988, to give passengers more time to enjoy their ride. The track is open daily until 10pm, so it is also a great way to enjoy views of Pest at night.
This stretch of the Danube walkway goes from the Elizabeth Bridge to the Chain Bridge, and is perfect for those who want a short, but interesting walk. Promenading along the Danube is a great way to see many of the most famous sights in the capital.
Looking over towards to Buda side of the river, you will see the Buda Castle, the Liberty Statue on Gellert Hill and the Fisherman’s Bastion. On the Promenade side of the river, you can enjoy restaurants, cafes, Szechenyi Istvan Square and a range of different sculptures, including the Little Princess
Located on Vörösmarty Square and dating back to 1858, Gerbeaud is one of Budapest’s most famous spots to get delicious desserts. Unlike at the other spots, here I have three recommendations. Firstly, the Dobos Torte as they bake it is the very best…secondly because it’s Emil Gerbeaud that gave the world the Gerbeaud slice (also written as ‘Zserbó szelet’), we suggest the rethought/reworked version of this Hungarian favourite: the Gerbeaud Sundae. While it’s quite pricey (2550 HUF + service fee), it’s a huge dessert that’s practically a meal. Two scoops of walnut sponge, one scoop of chocolate ice-cream, two scoops of walnut ice-cream, chocolate sauce, apricot sauce, crispy walnut linzer, whipped cream and apricot foam, topped with a small Gerbeaud slice. It’s super sweet, yet the perfect mix of old and new, cake and cream, warm and cold. Secondly, we recommend the classic cake served with vanilla ice-cream and the legendary ‘cat’s tongue.’
Sissy, wife of Emperor Franz Joseph and Queen of Hungary always dropped in the Gerbeaud cafe when she was in Budapest.
MY SUPER FAVOURITE REMAINS THE DOBOS TORTE!!!
I like very much the idea and feeling of sipping a cafe while surrounded by books and magazines.
The building shows some wonderful neo-renaissance characteristics, especially when we’re drinking a hot black coffee in the room decorated with Lotz Károly’s murals. Used to be my favourite with a superb coffee place, sadly the coffee has closed, Bookshop is great
39 Andrássy út ·Website
Once the residence of Manó Mai (1855–1917), photographer ro the imperial court, this 120-year- old listed building houses an exhibition hall, the Sunlight Atelier, bookshop and library.
20 Nagymező Street Website
This is the main English language bookstore of Budapest. They offer decent prices and a large selection of travel books, both for Hungary and the other countries. You can find unique gifts for the book lovers in your life at Bestsellers. Street & River loves this place!
11 Október 6. St Website
It’s a little quiet island in the heart of the city with great coffee and tasty, homemade cakes, cute service and a wide range of foreign language books.
30 Nagy Diófa ut. Website
They seem to have everything…..except a coffee place!
1072 Budapest Rákóczi út 12.
I strongly believe in Budapest like in most of Mittel/Eastern Europe you can eat well and genuinely with 4/7 Euro. The places below reflect this feeling and are my favourites. You can have a meal with 900–1600 HUF
Our favourite restaurant during the stays in Budapest. The portions are huge at a decent price (and you can always ask for a smaller portion for 70% of the price!). The lovely home-made lemonade is a mix of lemon, orange and basil which is super refreshing and you can order a half a litre of it. Their goulash is superb as well as the
The service is always really nice too, answering all the questions we had about the dishes. Family and friendly staff. This is where you can find us in the evening when we are in the Capital!
Budapest, Hold u. 11, 1054 Hungary
This place is a cheap place to eat traditional, and not only. It;s a buffet type, and not a traditional restaurant, and I think it’s a bit underrated, compared to the very overrated and expensive “City Market” restaurant choices — this place is just around the corner from the City Market, and has the same nice dishes, for less money — and you always have a place to sit and eat, unlike the market. We live very close when in Budapest so it is our fav lunch place
Lonyay utca 7, Budapest 1093, Hungary
A new find, next to the beer owned Kaltenberg Restaurant. It is very nice and modern, Staff is attentive and the food is good!

A simple, inexpensive cash-only eatery with only 5–6 tables (prepare to share the table with other guests). If you want to try hearty Hungarian food this the place to go. Menu in English is available.
Daily menu (soup + main dish or főzelék + meat or sausage) from around HUF 800 -1 200. Try mushroom paprikash with galuska, or máglyarakás (a typical local sweet treat: layers of sliced crescents, apples, apricot jam, with meringue on top and baked in oven.

We arrived in Budapest yesterday afternoon. It took quite a bit to get here from Wisconsin but that’s for another post. Our travels went as planned and we stepped on to the Viking Longship we were traveling on around 2 o’clock in the afternoon.
After drinks, dinner, and partially unpacking in our stateroom, I dragged my husband across town to walk over the famous Chain Bridge at night to get a much-wanted, even required, photograph of the Budapest Parliament Building.
It and other buildings in Budapest are beautifully illuminated at night, as are the bridges that span the Danube River in that part of Hungary.
Walking from our boat, between the Liberty Bridge and the Elizabeth Bridge, to the Parliament Building was at least a couple of miles. After traveling on a plane for most of the last day, walking was a welcome relief.
My husband and I are big walkers on vacation. We enjoy it.
Before we got to the Chain Bridge, we had beautiful views of Buda Castle high on the Budapest side of the Danube. Again, gorgeous!

A lot of Hungarian soldiers and civilians died during World War I and their loved ones went numb. Their fathers, brothers, husbands and sons were somewhere away from home, either mixed in soil or were feeding themselves to birds. Until then Budapest was more attractive than a magnet to tourists from every part of the world. The post-war effects and an approach of the new war engulfed Budapest.
Budapest was now in the arms of mass suicides, which arose from the day of losing their loved ones. Budapest became “The city of Suicides”. Will you believe me if I say all these happened because of a popular song “Gloomy Sunday”, which was printed in Sunday Times? It was also called ‘the suicide song’ and ‘the killer song’. It was written in a hundred languages around the world and has claimed to have killed hundreds of people.
All the people who drowned in the deep waters of Danube River had left behind the newspaper cutting of Sunday Times, which had the lyrics of the song. It was composed by Rezső Seress and published in 1933. Here are the lines.
“Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?
Gloomy Sunday
Death is no dream,
For in death I’m caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I’ll be blessing you
Gloomy Sunday”
The song somehow gave hope to all the people who wanted to reunite with their loved ones.
In 1937, ‘The Sunday Times’ wrote an article on the “ City of Suicides”. It’s funny how the newspaper criticises and asks to ban the song and the lyricist for suicides. When it was The Sunday Times, who propagated and shared those lines throughout Budapest in the first place. The song was then banned on radios.
The politicians, social activists, common people were searching for a solution. To bring out people from their sad lives. And now professor Jeno and hypnotist Binczo brought out the“Smile School”. This was to counteract the unending love for suicides.
People of Budapest had already forgotten how to smile. Not even a four-year-old smiled. The Smile School was introducing them to a different world. At first people were made to wear a smiling mask. Teaching them, how to smile by hiding their feelings inside. They thought that teaching the people how to smile would make them happier. And finally forget the pain!
Then they started teaching different styles of smile, the Roosevelt smile, the Mona Lisa smile, the Dick Powell smile, the Loretta smile, and a lot more. They could choose the smile of any celebrity they loved and the fees was depending on the type of smile they want to master. They claimed to charge up to $500 for teaching the Roosevelt smile in six weeks. Roosevelt had the best smile!
The Mona Lisa smile is more difficult but cheaper. They were asked to do the smiles they were learning five times a day, using a mirror. Founder of Smile School, hypnotist Jeno said says the best business is enabling pupils to achieve the talent of smiling naturally.
Thousands of people around Budapest joined the Smile Schools desperately to learn how to smile! All around the world, where Budapest was once called the “ City of Suicides” a new name came up, “The City of Smiles.” However there was no reduction in suicides, the change was only in the name!
There were still people dying around with the song “ Gloomy Sunday” near the banks of Danube.
By then the whole Smile School was proved to be a hoax by Het Leven.
BUDAPEST, “CITY OF SUICIDES,” IS TAUGHT TO FORCE A SMILE
A joker in Budapest, Hungary lately evolved the “smile school” The idea was made in purpose to counteract the bad publicity Budapest has gotten from the number of suicides supposedly inspired by the Budapest song, Gloomy Sunday. The suicide rate in Budapest is actually very high, even now.
The Smile School was then shut down, with the beginning of World War II. But this simple odd idea of teaching people smile led to the evolution of Laughter brigades and Laughter clubs around the world!
Love,
Dona

I wouldn’t classify myself as spontaneous. I always like to evaluate and ponder big decisions or dilemmas before taking any action. That being said I am becoming more aware of the privilege that being in my early 20s affords me. I am not settled in a specific place, have no real commitments apart from my work and no one yet depends on me to live their life. I find stating this particularly freeing, it is good to be able to make last-minute plans with friends and this is a luxury that is only typically afforded at the start and end of your life. However, this is not something I usually take advantage of and most recently I have been wanting to utilize it as I know I will miss it as life progresses.
In the company I work at, we have an internal shop slack channel where people can buy or sell goods. Last month, my friend spotted last-minute plane tickets being sold a week in advance for a weekend getaway to Budapest and naturally he suggested that we go. I was originally unsure about this, I wanted to spend this weekend achieving some tasks before climbing in Portland. But naturally, something in my mind told me to use this privilege in my life and go on the trip. So somewhat apprehensively I agreed! This blog is going to go over our adventure in Budapest!
Day 1
Our departing flight left at 8 am, so this meant a 5 am starting journey to Luton airport (thanks Ben for driving us). I typically don’t like taking early morning flights but I really enjoyed the experience of waking up early and being in another country by lunchtime.
Our flight landed just after lunch, and after getting through the terrible queues for passport control (thank you Brexit!) we got a bus and metro into town and picked out a great brunch spot for lunch called cookie beacon. This was a great restaurant to eat, it catered for Ben’s burger craving and my gluten allergy. They also had keto cookies, which were really good and filling. During this time we outlined what we wanted to achieve on this trip, where we wanted to go and the experiences we wanted to have.
We first headed into central Budapest (on the Pest side of the river) to check out a thermal bath. We decided that as it was a Friday, this was the best time to try and go to avoid it being overcrowded. We chose the Széchenyi Thermal Bath, while it is more expensive than some of the other baths it looked much better and was located in a lovely area near the central park. I would definitely recommend checking out a bath while in Budapest, while it is not on the level of the Blue Lagoon in Iceland they don’t have the eggy smell that sulphur baths have and unlike a swimming pool, they get very warm.
One word of advice is to make sure you bring your own flip-flops to these baths, most require you to wear them and the prices they charge for them are extortionate!
After spending the afternoon in the bath, we took a walk back to the Airbnb we picked out and cooked up some dinner, excited to make the most of our time in the country.
Day 2
As this was our only full day in Budapest we wanted to make the most of it. We decided to take an early morning walking tour of Budapest. These are pretty common in Europe, they are free to sign up for and the tour guide will expect tips at the end. I always enjoy taking these types of tours when a visit a new city, they are a great way to see as much of the city as you can and they provide much-needed context to any attractions.
We had a great tour guide (thanks Regina!), and some highlights for me included the St. Stephen’s Basilica church, the USSR and Nazi monuments and the Hungarian Parliament building. Regina was incredibly knowledgeable about all the sites we stopped off at and gave some great recommendations for clubs and bars in Budapest to visit.
One interesting moment for me during the tour was the Nazi monument. This monument was created in memory of the Nazi invasion and subsequent occupation of Hungary. As Regina explained to us, this statue has potential implications that Hungary is absolved from collaboration with the Nazi government and the actions that they took. As a result, this is a controversial attraction for some, especially Jewish Hungarians.
After taking the tour we grabbed some lunch and then walked across the river to Buda to visit the castle, stopping to take some scenic pictures of the Hungarian parliament building from the river.
To end our day we decided to double down on our spontaneity and go to a bar and club. We received a great piece of advice from Regina to visit the Szimpla Kert ruin bar, these ruin bars are built from bombed buildings in WW2. Instead of being rebuilt, they were minimally converted into bars and make for a really nice setting as they have a lot of natural light and character to them.
We ended our day with a night out at the Instant-Fogas Complex club. Clubbing is not something that I do often as in the past I have not had enjoyable experiences, but in the spirit of this holiday, I thought I would give it another go. Surprisingly we had a great time, even catching the closing stages of a Hungarian rock concert before the dancefloor started getting busy.
Day 3
After enjoying ourselves the night before we decided to have a lazy morning. We grabbed coffee at Anna’s cafe in the centre near the river and then relaxed in Elizabeth Square. At lunchtime, we headed back to the airport to catch our flight home.
Conclusions
Overall this was a really special trip for me. It took me outside of my comfort zone for the first time in a while and also took me away from my regular schedule. It felt really good to be spontaneous and I loved the trip. Budapest is a wonderful city full of beauty, character and history. Is it hard to comprehend coming from Britain that within the space of 70 or so years, Hungary has known 3 different types of political systems. It opens your mind and after all, that is the beauty of travelling, to take yourself out of your bubble and experience another country’s culture and educate yourself on their history.
Usually, I am very keen on planning out a schedule when going abroad, but during this trip I allowed myself to relax and let the plans get made as and when we chose to. There was something very freeing and relaxing about this. This was only possible as I had such good friends with me, I could trust that I could be honest with them and we had each other best interests at heart.
Overall this trip has been an amazing experience and I can’t wait to go on another weekend trip, spontaneous or not!

It was early on Thursday morning.
Neither my dad nor I got a good night’s sleep.
My father ate something which evidently didn’t agree with him.
While I was jittery with a mixture of anxiety and excitement.
Excited because I was about to visit a part of the world I’d never been to before:
Eastern Europe.
Prior to this experience, I’d never stepped foot in Eastern Europe before.
Sure, technically speaking, Istanbul is in Eastern Europe.
And I’d also been to Greece as a kid.
But this was different.
For the first time in my life, I’d be venturing deep into the land of the iron curtain.
I’d heard so much about this part of the world, and in modern times it’s been described as a European paradise.
All the benefits of capitalism while maintaining its traditional roots.
Something I wish I could say the same about Britain.
So yes, I was excited.
But I was also anxious.
Not about the journey, but about something else.
Namely my love life.
But I’ll save that for day 3.
Stick around and keep reading this series if you’d like to know what happens.
Either way, I barely got any sleep before our flight and was absolutely knackered.
I woke up around 8 and got ready for the taxi’s arrival at 9.
Everything was going according to plan.
We left the house at 9AM and zoomed off to the airport.
Despite the airport being miles away, we got there in just 45 minutes.
0 traffic = 0 problems.
The airport too was a walk in the park.
We checked our bags in with zero problems and got through security without a single hiccup.
I was a little nervous about the sheet of paper I’d been given by the immigration beaurea.
It didn’t look super legit and I wasn’t sure if I’d be turned away at passport control.
Thankfully, I didn’t and everything was cool.
We find our gate and chill out in the seats.
After a few minutes of listening to music and playing chess, we were ready to board the plane.
We queue up and see something strange…
Some people are being escorted out of the line and are being told some awful news.
Me and my dad looked at each other, puzzled.
What could possibly be going on?
Turns out, some people weren’t given any seats to board the plane!
It seems Budapest is quite a popular destination.
Thank goodness we had the foresight to check-in online prior to arriving at the airport, otherwise it would have been us who’d be escorted out of the line.
With a sigh of relief and a few empathetic looks, we were on the plane and seated.
The flight flew by in a flash as I slept through all of it.
2 hours later, we were in Budapest and ready to start our Eastern European adventure.
I’d done some research and was clued up on what to do once arriving at the airport.
We did all the formal stuff like going through passport control and picking up our bags.
Next came the fun part:
Finding our way into the city.
Me and my dad each bought a 15 day transport pass which allowed us unlimited access on every transportation in the city for… you guessed it, 15 days.
I had a look online and people were saying there was a week pass, but they’ve clearly changed it.
Either way, we grabbed one of those (called a 15-Day Budapest Pass) and made our way to the bus stop.
The plan was to get the 100E bus which would take us straight into the city centre.
We would have done this if it weren’t for the fact that our Budapest pass isn’t valid for that particular bus (typical).
I asked one of the conductors what to do and he told us we could get the 200E bus that would take us to where we needed to go.
Sweet!
I picked up a map and started doing some high IQ geographical calculations in my head.
I love this about going to a new place.
There’s a certain thrill about figuring out how to find your way around.
I do this everywhere I go.
When I first lived in Istanbul, I would always be hopping on different buses/tubes and exploring.
When I moved to London, I’d spend months venturing into the city centre and finding my way round.
Budapest was no exception.
We got on the 200E bus and ended up at the closest Metro station (Kőbánya-Kispest).
This was our first taste of Hungary, and I’m not gonna lie, it was weird.
A lot of the advertising was similar to the stuff you’d see in rural Turkey, except with a European twist.
Instead of a woman in a headscarf advertising a homemade pide restaurant, we had juiced up Europeans advertising a local supplement company.
The buildings were a mix of modern monstrosities and Soviet era crumblings.
It wasn’t until we entered the city of Budapest that I was faced with the sheer beauty of humanity’s potential.
There was also a moment where a homeless guy walked onto the bus and stunk the place up.
It brought me back to a sunny Spring day in Sheffield where a man who hadn’t showered in months had everyone gasping for fresh air with his stench.
Not exactly the warmest welcome…
From Kőbánya-Kispest we took the blue M3 Metro line to Ferenciek Tere.
If you’re curious, this is right into the centre of Pest and just a minutes walk from the Danube.
In hindsight, we didn’t need to go to this station as Deak Ferenc Ter (the stop before it) would have helped us get to our desired destination a lot faster.
Even so, we learnt this later on after some research.
From Ferenciek Tere we walked on the main street up towards Astoria and eventually reached Blaha Lujza Ter (where our hotel and subsequently our AirBNB was).
On our walk, we got our very first look at Budapest.
And honestly?
I was a little underwhelmed.
Lots of homeless people.
A strange smell in the air (mostly urine).
Much fewer Hungarians than I had pictured.
And it was absolutely scorching hot.
No doubt, this was my fault.
I had this idea of Hungary being a European bastion of beauty.
I expected everything to be pristine, clean and perfect.
With those kinds of high standards, I was bound to be met with some dissapointment.
If you’re Hungarian and reading this, don’t be offended.
I love Budapest.
I just want to give you my honest first impressions before fully discovering the true beauty of the city.
After a few minutes of walking, I noticed something concerning.
My dad was limping.
And he wasn’t limping a little, he was limping quite heavily.
He’d mentioned the night before our flight that he had a pain in his foot, and clearly the pain hadn’t subsided.
I asked him if he was alright and he grimaced back, “I’m fine, just get a bloody move on”.
I heard the man and we marched on towards our hotel.
We didn’t have to march long as within a few minutes were outside our hotel in the middle of town.
It was a really weird hotel.
Looked utterly rubbish on the outside, but the inside was as lavish as you could possibly imagine.
It’s called the Atrium Fashion Hotel and it’s located on Csokonai utca, one street behind the Blaha Lujza ter Metro station.
If you want to visit Budapest, I think you’d enjoy your time at this hotel.
Our room was cosy, the hotel staff were extremely helpful and friendly (Hi Adam!) and it’s right in the centre of Pest.
We were only there for one night, but we had a good time.
After getting into our room, we did what any normal people would do:
Have a shower and then a nap.
(Not together obviously, that would be weird lol).
After waking up, it was pretty late.
Like I said, neither of us slept well the night before and needed to recover.
Once we woke up, it was time to go for a wander.
My dad struggled to get into his trainers as his foot was as swollen as Arnold Schwarzenegger’s biceps. But once they were in, we were ready to go.
The first point of call was to find the place where my dad would be attending his business conference.
While he’d be spending most of his days in Budapest there, I’d be free to check out the Hungarian capital solo.
After swerving in and out of meandering side-streets, we were able to find the conference hall with little difficulty.
Weirdly, it was located right in the middle of Pest’s party district.
Surrounding the conference venue were plenty of pubs, bars and nightclubs which were teeming with tourists and locals all day and all night.
Luckily for us, we were also able to find an incredible Hungarian restaurant with a live pianist.
My dad instantly fell in love with the piano player and couldn’t stop applauding his every move.
I honestly think he loved the music more than the food, which is saying something because the food was outstanding.
I had a Goulash soup followed by a Goulash dish.
The result?
Love.
I officially love Hungarian food.
It’s incredible.
While I was busy guzzling down the wonderful meal that was in front of me, my dad was staring starry eyed at the pianist as he played love songs with his elegant fingers.
At one point, my dad got so into it that he began singing at the top of his lungs and began drawing confused looks from everyone in the restaurant.
My cheeks flushed red in embarassment as I pleaded for him to stop, but he wouldn’t listen:
“WEEEE ARE THE CHAMPIONS, MY FRIENDS…..
AND WEEEE’LL, KEEP ON FIIIGHTING TILL THE END…”
Safe to say we both had a great time on our first night in Budapest.
Tomorrow would be even better…
If you liked this little story, stay tuned for the next ones.
I’m going to be sharing everything I did and all the things I was feeling on my travels.
Thanks for reading,
Godfrey

Budapest, like other capital cities, have interesting memorials and statues that turn heads and force conversation. And there are plenty of them too; afterall, the largest statue park in Europe is also here, measuring a huge 56 hectares (Kerepesi Cemetery).
Memento Park is also just outside the city, and born from a difficult past. After the lifting of the Iron Curtain, Hungarians uprooted and dumped almost every statue placed during the communist period. Out of the city; out of the mind. The following are a list of the most interesting statues in Budapest.
Belgrád rkp., 1056
A lovely stroll down the Pest-side of the Danube pedestrian zone will bring you to these two wholesome figures. It’s a spitting distance to the ‘little princess’, and a beautiful place to photograph and take in the views of the Buda side. Look out for The Marriott Hotel.
Actually, not much is known about these statues, except that the Sculptor Raffay Dávid had known he wanted to be a sculptor from an early age — three years old!
Széchenyi Lánchíd, 1051
When I first arrived in Budapest, I was told the Myth about the Lions on the four corners of the Széchenyi Bridge. It goes a little something like this.
In 1852, sculptor János Marschalkó unveiled his stone work to be used on the recently opened Széchenyi Bridge. He was so proud of his work that he announced he would throw himself off the bridge if any faults were found. The story goes on to say that a girl spoke up that the lions had no tongues. He threw himself off the bridge out of embarrassment.
Whether he did or not, it’s a story full of passion, big-headedness, and a pinch of comedy (OK, tragedy). János Marschalkó lived well into the 1870’s, and for good reason — the lions HAVE tongues, they just can’t be seen from a low perspective.
NB — This made me think of The National Library in Sarajevo — Check it out!
Corvin sétány 1, 1082
I’m sure you know Bud Spencer — an actor, famous for adventure comedies, crime escapades and spaghetti westerns. This rootin’, tootin’ and gun-shootin’ Italian, originally from Naples, starred in over 50 films, a handful of TV and even a video game. Although Budapest is well known for filmmaking, Bud Spencer never came to Budapest, neither filmed any scenes here. So why the statue?
Bud Spencer didn’t receive the attention he did until he teamed up with Terence Hill in the late 60’s. Together, they created simple yet action packed films that everyone around the world could enjoy. Hungarians, during the communist occupation, fell in love with the entertainment he brought with each new film. They were the popular stars from a foreign country — an attractive one from outside the communist reach. Although they appeared dubbed, the story lines were easy enough to follow without needing to know the language.
The huge bronze statue weighs in at half a ton, and was placed there a year after his death in 2016 by sculptor Szandra Tasnádi as a beautiful sign of respect. It is the first one of its kind, and at the unveiling was Cristiana Pedersoli (daughter) and Olympic water polo player György Kárpáti (friend). The inscription “We never fought” were the words Terrence Hill used to describe Bud at his funeral.
Zrínyi u., 1051
One of the most visited and famous statues in Budapest is the fat policeman — you can tell by his shiny belly. His location couldn’t get any better as he gets to stare at the St. Stephan's Basilica all day. Tourists can’t help but get a snap of themselves with him.
The fat policeman statue in central Budapest was sculptured by Illyés András in 2008, and can be found on the corner of Zrínyi and Október 6. Street. The sculpture itself was based on the characteristics of peoples faces dwelling in the city, with the portly physique taken from the sculptors grandfather.
Práter u. 11, 1082
This collection of statues portrays a group of boys playing marbles outside an old brick school building. It is a depiction of a scene early on in the book Pál utcai fiúk — the Paul Street Boys.
You’ll find this gem just round the corner from Corvin Shopping Plaza.
This book by Hungarian author Ferenc Molnár tells the story of two gangs of children fighting over rundown territory. The book became hugely popular and turned into a famous Hungarian classic, still taught in primary school.
NB — If you like this story, the National Museum in Budapest has created a marble run and area in honour of the Pal Street Boys — perfect for young kids!
Walking Tour Idea — If you're looking for a street map of these statues, check out our link here.
Falk Miksa u., 1055
Columbo is one of Hungary’s most admired characters — it might have something to do with Peter Falk’s Hungarian heritage. His mother, a Jewish Hungarian emigrated to the States before he was born.
His statue shows his typical thinking posture with cigar in hand, while his basset hound dog named ‘dog’ stares at him patiently. Funnily enough, the statue was placed opposite the National Comedy Theatre, and visible from Jászai Mari square.
Dob u. 12, 1072
Carl Lutz was the Budapest based Swiss Vice-Consul from 1942 until 1945 — the end of World War II. As a designer and leader of the largest most successful rescue operation, he was instrumental in saving more than 62,000 Hungarian Jews. In fact, Budapest is the only capital in Eastern Europe where enough Hungarian Jews survived to continue their community — over 100,000.
You’ll find these statues one block away from the Dohány Street Synagogue’s Tree Of Life. The inscription reads: In the building at Szabadság tér 12, Swiss Vice Consul Carl Lutz honorably represented the interests of the United States of America and other countries between 1942 and 1945. He courageously saved the lives of tens of thousands of Hungarian citizens persecuted as Jews.
Belgrád rkp., 1051
The Little Princess statue is one of the most famous sculptures in Budapest because of its perfect location. This statuette sits on the railings next to the pedestrian area on the Pest side of the Danube and scenic Tram 2. Expect great views and a perfect place for photographs.
The artist, László Marton created this in 1972, taking his eldest daughter as inspiration. Apparently, she would wear his dressing gown and parade around as a princess. This statue is so loved that copies have sprung up in the Hungarian town of Tapolca and in front of the concert hall of the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Space in Japan.
Szabadság tér 16, 1054
Ronald Reagan is a little strange as a statue in Budapest, let alone in the very important Freedom Square (Szabadság tér). It feels out of place until you realise it was created to honour Reagan and his efforts in ending the cold war. The end of the cold war would end the Soviet occupation of Hungary.
The positioning is perfect — not only is he walking toward the American Embassy, he is also staring at the monument dedicated to the Soviet liberation of Hungary in World War II from Nazi German occupation.
Vajdahunyad stny, City Park, 1146
One of the most fascinating statues in Budapest is the one known as ‘Anonymous’, and definitely one of my favourites. The hooded man is sitting in a relaxed pose, holding a pen. An inscription starts with a capital ‘P’, and continues with “dictus magister ac quondam bone memorie gloriosissimi Bele regis Hungarie notarius” (and Bela the master of the king of Hungary was struck by the notary who were once of the most glorious of good memory). The ‘P’ is likely his name, or an abbrev. of praedictus, meaning ‘aforementioned’.
The anonymous statue of Budapest was the notary of the Hungarian king Béla III, and famous for his work Gesta Hungarorum (“The Deeds of the Hungarians”) over 800 years ago. It’s the most detailed account of the Hungarians’ arrival to the Carpathian basin. Being a very important writer, people make their way to the inner court area of the Vajdahunyad Castle to touch his pen, and receive special, ungodly writing powers. Worth a try.
These statues of peoples shoes on the Danube river bank hold on to one of the haunting and saddest situations in Hungary’s history. These 60 pairs of shoes are a memory to those who were killed by Arrow Cross Party in 1944–45. Let’s back up a little.
When Germany waged war through Europe, it was only a matter of time before their attention came to Hungary. The government was overthrown in October 1944, Ferenc Szalasi was the puppet that took the job. His fascist and antisemitic ideas were poured into the Arrow Cross Party, who beat and killed Jewish citizens of the city.
As shoes were valuable, the victims were made to remove their shoes before being executed and left to fall into the cold, strong current of the Danube. Almost 100,000 Jews vanished. 80,000 Jews left the country by force, and the other 20,000 were shot along the river banks. These life-sized shoes with amazing detail were installed in 2005 by Can Togay (Director; The Summer Guest) and Gyula Pauer (Sculptor).

It was the summer of 2015. My husband and I travelled to Budapest with our son and his better half.
Our three-day trip to the city was the most enjoyable and unforgettable. Budapest has a distinct charm, and its glorious setting astride the Danube River makes it a great place to visit.
The Budapest vacation helped us to build lifelong memories and break away from the usual hectic routine. It allowed us to enjoy a new culture, food and experiences.
The Szenchenyi chain bridge spans the river Danube between Buda on the western side and Pest on the eastern side. It is a permanent bridge across the Danube in Hungary. A series of bridges connect Buda and Pest.
Budapest is the most beautiful city on the Danube. The city’s panorama is breathtaking, and you can enjoy the most when on a cruise ship.
The best part of the tour was taking a cruise down the Danube, passing landmarks like the National Parliament and Buda Castle. It was an incredible experience!
Especially in the evening hours when you get to see the illuminated parliament. You get to enjoy the complimentary welcome drink as you take in the sights of the city.
The Liberty bridge is the southernmost public road bridge in Budapest. It is the shortest bridge in the centre of Budapest.
Our Funicular ride to the Buda Castle was enjoyable. You get a captivating view of the city below.
Buda Castle is a remarkable castle. The National Gallery, National Library and the History Museum are located inside this castle. It sits on the top of the castle hill.
We enjoyed the old-fashioned pastry shops and many good cafes and restaurants — a must-see place for anyone visiting Budapest.
Every colourful dish was equally inviting, and it was difficult to resist the temptation to gobble them all up!
The Dohany Synagogue was very close to our Airbnb. It is the largest European synagogue and has a seating arrangement for nearly 3000 people.
You can see travellers clicking pictures of the interior. You get to see the brilliant Tohrah Ark made of coloured and golden geometric shapes.
The weeping willow tree is in the synagogue's backyard. It has metal leaves on which family names of Hungarian Jews murdered in the Holocaust are carved.
On the last day of our stay, we visited the St Gerard Sagredo statue. It is one of the historical landmarks in Budapest.
The views from this place on top of the hill are stunning — one of the most visited attractions in Budapest.
Heroes Square is one of the major squares in Budapest. It has the museum of fine arts on the left and the Palace of art on the right.
The central feature is the Millennium memorial. The two colonnades behind the monument each have seven statues representing significant figures of Hungarian history.
“Travelling in the company of those we love is home in motion.”- Leigh Hunt.
The most significant benefit of family travel is bonding with the dearest people in your life and exploring places together.
Every year we look forward to family travel, visiting a new place, exploring and creating memories.

Today, coffee is more than just a drink; it’s a necessary component of the traditional morning ritual. Coffee plays an essential role in daily life, whether you stumble out of bed and head straight for the cafetière or impatiently wait in line, hoping the barista rushes to serve you a flat white so you can get to work on time. Coffee has become a cultural phenomenon embedded in societies worldwide, but the journey of coffee stretches far beyond the early-morning hustle of today’s world. In Budapest, coffee is one of the many threads of the city’s rich tapestry. This documentary, Budapest’s Coffee Obsession, takes audiences on a historical exploration of rich brewing techniques through the travels of coffee lover Lyrkan Thuery. This paper will begin by conducting a brief textual analysis of two screen productions: Rise of Empires: Ottomans (2020) and The Story Of Coffee (2016). The analysis of the two…

I wasn’t ready for Budapest.
In 2004, T, my sister, brother-in-law, and I found super cheap flights to Budapest and decided to travel there on a whim. Being that it was 2004, Budapest wasn’t on many travelers’ radars like it is now.
Of course we expected it to be beautiful, much like many of the other European cities we had previously visited. But we had no idea just how majestic and spellbinding Budapest truly is. A magical merge of striking allure, historical grandeur, and cutting-edge grittiness that had us enamored right from the start.
There are so many things to love about Budapest, but here’s a good start: it’s brimming with stunning architecture, amazing thermal baths, breathtaking views, and a distinguished culture.
Still not convinced? It’s extraordinarily affordable, especially when compared to many other European cities.
Below are the top ten things to do in beautiful Budapest.
One of the most iconic landmarks in all of Hungary, the Parliament Building is a spectacular example of exquisite Neo-Gothic architecture. This masterpiece of a building is a popular tourist attraction, equally due to its magnificent splendor and idyllic location along the meandering Danube River. It’s worth walking around the back as well to get the full scale of its grandness, as well as the sheer beauty of the structure.
Hailing as the second longest river in all of Europe, it’s pretty much impossible to miss this imposing Danube River. Riverside strolls and sails are not only a must here, they’re pretty much inevitable. The Danube River is the beating pulse of Budapest, coursing its way through the expansive city.
Fun fact: The capital city of Budapest was the result of the unification of separate towns of Buda and Pest in 1873.
One of the many things we loved about Budapest is its walkability, and perhaps nowhere within the city encourages individuals to explore it by foot than the Szechnyi Chain Bridge.The pedestrian-friendly bridge offers fantastic views of both Buda and Pest and is one of the main bridges in Budapest that links the majority of sites.
Perched upon Castle Hill, Fisherman’s Bastion is a remarkable spot to enjoy panoramic views of the river and Pest beyond it. Its historical charm and opulence outweigh the fellow tourists that will inevitable accompany your visit. Think striking towers, spilling-over terraces, and attractive cobbled streets. A lovely spot to soak up Budapest’s radiance.
This luxurious historical castle and royal palace complex pays homage to the Hungarian kings. As the most prominent building of Castle Hill, it dominates the hill and provides beyond impressive views of the city and river. While it’s worth visiting at any time of the day, nightfall is particularly special when it’s dramatically illuminated.
Thing to know: Riding the funicular is a relatively cheap and scenic way to reach the Buda Castle hill. Click here for rates and hours of operation.
Promise me this: you will not leave Budapest without visiting at least one of its delightful spas and soaking in its thermal baths. One of the highlights of our trip was spending an afternoon at Gellert Spa and Bath. Dating back to 1918, Gellert Baths is one of the city’s oldest and most famous bathhouses.
The building’s interior is ornate and lavish, with a number of various wellness treatments offered. My sister and I opted for a massage and soak in the heated pools. Note that the establishment does get busy, so you may want to go on the earlier (or later) side in hopes of avoiding large crowds. We visited later in the day and found the spa and pools to be pretty quiet. Remember to pack your swimwear and some thick skin-the Hungarian masseuses are known to be very strong and firm (I can definitely attest to this!).
It should be no surprise that Hungarian food is HEAVY. Stick-to-your-ribs heavy. But also, pretty damn delicious. Depending on what time of year you travel to Hungary, your level of appreciation for its gluttonous heavy ways may vary. It was cold during our travels, and our bellies and souls craved as much warming comfort food as we could possibly get. So you might say that we welcomed all of its savory goulashes, stews, and soups with open hearts and eager tastebuds.
Hungarian cuisine is the epitome of comfort food, and we wouldn’t have wanted it any other way.
Hands down the best meal of the trip was at Gundel, a formal restaurant that serves delicious gourmet Hungarian fare.
There is no shortage of grand and historical coffeehouses in Budapest. If you need to seek some solace from the cold, you are in for a real treat-we absolutely loved the cafe scene here. The most charming and delightful of all of the cafes that we visited was Gerbaud, an elegant cafe that’s worthy of the hype (and elevated prices).
The coffee, pastries, and desserts were decadently divine. We absolutely loved it here.
As mentioned previously, Budapest is a gloriously walkable city, with an efficient and reliable metro system to boot, making it a very easy city to explore. Take the time to meander and marvel at the unique architecture, iconic sites, and distinctive neighborhoods.
Heroes’ Square St. Stephen’s Basilica
Okay, so technically not in Budapest, but beautiful and lovely nonetheless, is Szentendre, an enchanting and picturesque Hungarian town alongside the Danube. A short and simple forty-five minute train ride delivers you directly to the quaint little village of a town, characterized by baroque architecture, historical churches, colorful houses and narrow, cobbled streets.
The charming main square and alleyways are lined with museum and art galleries, adorable shops and boutiques, and cozy restaurants and cafes.
We were captivated by Szentendre’s beauty and quietness. An absolutely delightful day trip from Budapest!
Four full days gave us a great introduction to the amazingness of Budapest. With its more recent rise in popularity, I’d love to return one day, especially to see how much the city has changed. Wishing you the happiest of travels to beautiful Budapest and beyond!

Budapest has become one of the top tourist destinations in Europe, for a good reason. Often, we do not recognize the beauty of the place that we live in anymore. But Budapest is simply amazing, and there is no reason to argue about it. It is not a city to tick in one or two days. Here you can easily spend a week discovering something new. But as in every place, being a tourist or live and work somewhere are two different things. Read till the end of this article if you want to know more about the complex image and the less charming sides of Budapest as well.
After having been to several corners of Europe, I can say that Budapest is the most picturesque city at night when it is enveloped in lights. No, it is not Paris. Budapest is the city divided by the river Danube into two parts, Buda as Pest. Hence the name Budapest.
I can be bored of seeing Jungfrau in Switzerland, the picturesque villages of Austria, or the countless churches of Italy. Still, I cannot cross the river Danube without throwing an eye on the ensemble of stunning monuments (The Buda castle, The Fisherman’s Bastion, The Chain Bridge, the…

A travel essay about Budapest and London, written in Copenhagen, Frankfurt, and Zagreb. I think I need to grow some roots.
Onwards!👇
When I’d come back from London, last year, I was flooded with splendor and grandiosity, yes, but was also sticky with the smell of a city that was once a heart of an empire but isn’t quite any longer. This smell emanated from every statue, monument, and stolid building. It oozed from the English gardens, swelled and dissipated with the Thames, fluttered on the rooftops like drunken pigeons. Even the somber tolling of the Big Ben carried with it an obvious verdict — an end to an era. London is well on its way to becoming just another capital city, albeit with a few more trinkets to auction, and a rather nasty sting in the form of the Trident nuclear missiles.
Coming back from Budapest I am flooded with a similar feeling, although it is far more nuanced and light. Hungary was once a rather significant European power (at least until the arrival of Ottomans and the collapse of so much European hubris). It extended all the way to Dalmatia and Slavonia in Croatia, something that is still touted by the old coat of arms scattered throughout the city — on the faces of buildings, forts, and magnificent bridges.
The city itself is monumental and even monolithic. It boasts elaborate facades studded with gargoyles, satires, and that European animal rarer than the unicorn, leprechaun, and Baba Yaga together. I am talking, of course, about the common African lion which the Europeans have elevated above every other animal of much greater use, economy, and industry. The lion can roar, yes, but is otherwise rather lazy and disinterested in the plight of both lionkind and mankind. Which, come to think of it, does a decent job of summarizing royalty worldwide.
Fine then, let the lion stand.
Walking through the streets of Budapest one eventually emerges onto the Hero Square, or the Hungarian Parliament Building, or Istvan Basilica. These buildings, along with many others, impart one of the most salient impressions of the city.
Nothing is small.
The streets are long, straight, and immensely wide, even the side streets. There are no London back alleys in Budapest. Buildings don’t come in sizes smaller than big. Some, like the Hungarian Parliament Building or the Széchenyi Medicinal Bath, are so large that it is easy to feel lost while walking their perimeter, let alone wandering their innards. Then there’s the Buda Castle on the Castle Hill, Hungarian National Library, St. Stephen’s Basilica, and a myriad of edifices that all carry with them a particularly Hungarian flavor — the beauty of Budapest architecture is incredible, improbable even, and unapologetically big.
The city has, since the 20s, been called the City of Baths, owing to the many thermal springs that soak its foundation — there are at least 6 in Budapest proper, and over a thousand in the whole of Hungary. The country essentially consists of boiling water, a few layers of dirt, and a city thrown on top, here and there.
We soaked our bodies in the Szechenyi Baths along with a thousand other people, of all colors, from every corner of the world, even those that now mostly supply the nameless people on the Hungarian fenced borders, trusting in the healing properties of thermal springs that contained sulfites and smelled the part.
The Bath itself is enormous, covering more than 6000 square meters, and boasting both indoor and outdoor thermal pools of varying temperatures. The largest outdoor pool is a special experience, particularly in the winter, with 36-degree water in 2-degree weather. Needless to say, the scalp gets a little chilly. There I also noticed a pandemic of a disease whose symptoms terrorize attention, ruin sleep, and cause a strange craning of the neck. I’m talking, of course, of the infernal smartphone whose allure seems so immense that the bathers couldn’t seem to bear parting with them, even in the pool. This forced them to hold one hand outside the water in the cold air, somewhat like the hand waving of English royalty, that is to say, dumb and unnecessary.
Since my smartphone habits are less than exemplary, I write this with slight rudeness to my cheek.
The city is nestled in a valley of hills and offers both flat grounds to cycle on and slopes to climb. In Budapest, unlike Copenhagen where I live, one has a use for the Achilles heel.
On one of the days we set out to explore the Grand Market but by the time we managed to saunter toward it, it had closed, leaving us only with a sight of its iridescent roof tiles. These tiles, called the Zsolnay tiles, are one of the most memorable sights in Budapest if you’re into that kind of a thing, which you are probably not. Neither am I, but these tiles still persist in my memory for reasons that remain unaccounted for.
With the closed doors of the Grand Market behind us, we set off across the magnificent Szabadság Bridge that joins its brethren in spanning the wide, mighty, and lazy Danube River. Even though it flows through Croatia, I’d never seen the Danube before and it was a curious feeling to know that, only a three hour drive downstream, my father had grown up in the town of Borovo, fishing and splashing his way through a childhood so far removed from mine that it sometimes seems almost fantastical.
On the other side of the river stands yet another monumental building. This time it’s the Gellért Thermal Bath whose pools gaped empty that day like the hands of a beggar who once knew splendor.
The Gellért Baths squat in the shadow of Gellért Hill, which was named after Saint Gerard who was allegedly thrown down its slopes to meet a gruesome death. The crown jewel of the hilL is the Liberty Statue, erected by the Soviets as a token to themselves for the liberation of Hungary at the end of WWII. The inscription on the bottom originally read:
“To the memory of the liberating Soviet heroes erected by the grateful Hungarian people in 1945.”
After the overthrow of communism in Europe, the inscription was later changed to:
“To the memory of those all who sacrificed their lives for the independence, freedom, and prosperity of Hungary.”
I found it an interesting example of how history, once decided upon, can certainly be changed, and changed again if need be.
Be that as it may, hundreds of people milled about the Liberty Statue under an angry, frozen Sun — some examining the high walls above, some examining the city below, but most, as you can imagine, examining the smartphone in their hands.
Of our own conduct I will not say much, except that we’d opted to breathe in the hazy vista that blankets the horizon, entwining people, nature, and the city of Budapest into a memory of a few short days touched by the long thoughts of history.
Thank you for reading.

This is the story of one of the least appealing things I have ever eaten. And also, of friendship. But mostly it’s about the unappealing thing. Read at your own risk.
…
You’re still here? Alright… let’s do this.
The November rain in Budapest seems to stick in the air like an impenetrable damp fog. The buildings are grandiose but muted, the people walk with their heads down, not in a hurry, but simply uninterested in their surroundings. I’ve traveled here with Garrett, a dry humored Canadian who has just come aboard the kitchen at my job in Sweden. With a week off of work, we agree to try a short trip together.
We are on the edge of town, searching for a local’s restaurant that one of us saw on some travel TV program. We’ve ridden away from the water that cuts between Buda and Pest, past the ornate museums and old sandstone buildings, and beyond the golden roofs. We are in a residential neighborhood now, drab Eastern European blocks houses, Soviet in look and feel; the sky here seems even more grey than before, the colors of the painted buildings seem a touch more muted.
We find Pléhcsárda hidden behind another small shack of a restaurant. The whole operation looks like a trailer set up in a trailer park. The dining room is a single table set up in front of the ordering window, which looks like it was made of…

Back on the rails, listening to stories and walking the ragged end of Budapest’s nineth district. To reach a nearby built-up area rather than retrace my steps through a wasteland with the occasional industrial complex I had spent the morning exploring on foot, I must cross six railway tracks with no formal crossing point. I watch a woman navigate the rails from the other side of the tracks and ask her advice about gaps in the fence there between road and rail before stepping out. With some trepidation. It is just three months since I fell down a railway embankment outside of Sofia in Bulgaria breaking my ankle and putting my Belt-Road tour from Beijing to Europe on hold as I limped back to London on crutches.
In contrast to earlier sections of the Belt-Road’s Middle Passage, many rail tracks connect Sofia, the first stop in Europe with the rest of the continent. I settle on the route through Bucharest in Romania, skirting around Belgrade in Serbia where, as in Bucharest, stories of Chinese investments suggest built, financial and social landscapes reformatted. Leaving the ground for a moment and taking a more abstract view from above, these stories boil down to minimising regulations, short-circuiting tendering processes, riding rough shod over environmental regulations, confiscating land and poor compensation: all in the rush to begin construction. Beneath these stories are cash-strapped local economies, anxious politicians and local elites eager for Chinese finance and the profits they bring while local citizens pay off the loans through their taxes and watch the disappearance of public land. Budapest fits this description too. China’s direct investment in Hungary (2023) is more than US$8 billion, by far Europe’s biggest share.
Back on the ground, the wasteland I spent the morning exploring on the ragged edge of Budapest’s nineth district is the site of China’s first university in Europe; Fudan Hungary University announced to great fanfare by both governments in 2021. I walk towards it across three and four line highways, elevated routeways made for traffic not walking and dotted with corporate offices. The BYD offices sit here along with a string of high-end car dealerships and the ‘Dream Store’ that sells bathroom fittings. BYD — which stands for Build Your Dreams — is the Chinese electric car and world-leading battery manufacturer hedging its bets on sanctions against China by setting up factories inside the EU. So far it’s Hungarian operations only makes batteries, but car factories are planned and reported to be in construction in other parts of the country.
I walk past construction sites confirming the feeling that this is one of the city’s edges, a place where Budapest is still being built. One of these has blue shipping containers stacked and creatively repurposed as housing and bathrooms for construction workers. I wander around marvelling at the use of surplus Chinese containers — trade between the two countries is asymmetrical — until a man in a high vis jacket throws me out. Next I pass the stylish white tubular athletics stadium on the edge of the area where the university is supposed to be. I can see no university, no ground being prepared, no suggestion of construction, only a large tract of scrub land in autumnal browns and yellows and an impressive derelict building that is gently falling down in the distance.
Walking further I find the exact place where the university might be but isn’t. I only know this from the street names — Dali Lama, Uyghur Martyrs, Free Hong Kong and Bishop Xi Shinguang of China’s underground Catholic Church. Krisztiana Baranyi, mayor of the nineth district, renamed the streets on which the new university would sit so as to annoy the Chinese Government and discourage the university’s construction. Popular protests erupted in 2021. Building didn’t start then and the scheme didn’t deliver a completed campus by 2024 as reports claimed it would. Optimistic news reports and announcements from both the Chinese and the Hungarian side insist that there would be five to six thousand students enrolled in shiny new buildings and five hundred staff at this outpost of China’s top tier university system by 2024. Instead there is no university; only a piece of wasteland waiting for something to happen.
Local citizens protesting the scheme object to the appropriation of city land for the education of elite students. The Budapest branch of Shanghai’s top tier university intended to charge the sort of fees most Hungarian students couldn’t afford, making it a resource only for the wealthiest. City plans earlier earmarked this area as a ‘student city’ intending it to be used to build low cost rental accommodation for students and young academics. The estimated costs of building Fudan in Budapest is in the region of E1.5 billion — more than Hungary’s Higher Education operating budget for 2019 — to be financed by a loan from China repaid by Hungarian tax payers. A Chinese contractor mired in scandal — China State Construction Engineering Corporation — would build the university using Chinese labour and materials making it hard to see the benefit for local people. Perhaps most controversially of all, delivery of this project is the responsibility of a Board of Trustees, headed by the Minister of Culture. Although there is no university and no project to manage, the Board of Trustees is paid E1.5 million a year — to date E16 million — for maintenance and operating costs on non-existent buildings despite not even having an office nor producing any activity reports (Daily News Hungary 13 August 2023).
A source close to the mayor told me that the university project hasn’t gone away, but as the Hungarian Government runs out of money it has stopped or slowed a number of expensive Chinese investment projects including the Fudan campus. Another story was offered by a taxi driver taking me to Budapest Keleti station for my train to Germany and the last stop on my Belt-Road tour. He understood that the mayor had secured permission for the athletics stadium to be built in the nineth district if the university proposal was dropped. He says that while the university project isn’t a secret, ‘no one talks about it’, although Fudan University and other Chinese projects indicate radically different directions in Budapest’s future.
Bigger stories run along these rails through Hungary too. Orbán’s Fidesz Party is desperate to attract Chinese finance, even now signing deals for factories, security systems to ‘combat terrorism’ and new railway connections to Belgrade and Budapest airport. Media reports show that Orbán’s closest local allies if not Orbán himself benefit from Chinese contracts. But the biggest story of all is geopolitical. Among many rosy statements about Chinese-Hungarian cooperation and solidarity, Xi Jinping loudly proclaims that Hungary is in China’s inner ‘circle of friends’. By this he means those countries that do the most to support China’s efforts to counter US power and influence in the world. Hungary’s rail tracks are the front line in tilting the axis of global power in China’s direction: offer a new vision for how the world might work (Financial Times 11 May 2024). This makes the rails that run through Budapest and its non-existent university a very big deal indeed.

I visited Budapest in 1990 very soon after the fall of the Iron Curtain, when the first glimmers of open gay life were just starting to show — nervous glimmers indeed compared to the astounding turnout of an estimated 200,000 people at the LGBTQ+ Pride march in the Hungarian capital on the 28th June 2025, the march expanding from a previous peak of 35,000 people as people came together in defiance of a ban put on the assembly by the Prime Minister, Viktor Orban.
In 1990 the gays in Budapest were not visible. There was a bar or two in the fashionable city centre where Spartacus, the gay guide to the world that every gay traveler kept in their backpack in those days, said gays were welcome. They were in no way gay bars — and the only club in town was in a discrete backstreet location some distance from the centre, had no signage to indicate its presence — but once inside I found a fledgling gay scene taking its first, nervous, steps. People were shy and guarded, but the music was good and we danced. I remember meeting a Russian ballet dancer. That was it. Gays were definitely not in the news. The big story in Budapest at the time was the opening of their first MacDonalds.
28th June this year was the 56th anniversary of the start of the Stonewall Riots in New York, the moment that is regarded as the kicking off point for the Gay Pride movement that emerged in the 1970s. As a direct consequence of the Hungarian government’s vindictive attack on the LGBTQ+ community, the world now sees how far the Hungarian people have come in accepting their queer brothers, sisters and children — this anniversary year may stand out in history as something like Hungary’s own Stonewall moment.
But no riot in Budapest. Despite threats to use facial recognition software and fine attendees, in the end the government directed the police to not harass participants and although they also gave permission to right wing groups to stage counter protests, nothing of any significance emerged from that. Instead a massive parade celebrating love in all its forms with attendees from 40 countries, stretched through the city. The photos and videos are incredible.
The beauty, harmony, love, peacefulness and joy on display revealed how utterly phobic and toxic the homophobic attitude of the ruling party is. The official ban was justified on the grounds of Pride being a danger to children — which simply reveals the dark minds of those proposing the ban, who are actually projecting their own dark thoughts onto gay people when they see us as sexual deviants and predators. Pride is not about sex, it’s about freedom — and knowing that, many heterosexuals walked in the march too.
Hungary is not the only eastern European country in which right wing politicians are stoking public debate about gay and trans people to fire up their base and to distract from anti-democratic legislation which they are pushing through their parliaments. It’s happening in Slovenia too. And some might say there’s signs of the same in the UK.
Pride is a Freedom March.
A Protest. A Declaration of Power.
Pride is Love In Action.

A Peek Inside The House of Terror — One of Budapest’s Most Notorious and Frightening Museums,https://articlesbypauletteklein.medium.com/a-peek-inside-the-house-of-terror-one-of-budapests-most-notorious-and-frightening-museums-e0249b4156d8,"Sign up

The Terror Museum isn’t your run-of-the-mill macabre haunted house type museum meant to temporarily scare you like a Hollywood movie. Instead, the terrors that took place inside this building are real, carried out by two separate regimes spanning from World War II to the Soviet communist area by their secret police.
The Terror Museum is located on the beautiful Andrassy Utca, one of Budapest’s most elegant boulevards with lush shady trees, stately apartment buildings, and high-end designer boutiques. This upscale bustling area of Budapest also has a dark and storied past. Nestled among the buildings on this posh street is where visitors will find the museum, which is one of Budapest’s most notorious and frightening buildings.
As I approached the entrance to the museum, I was struck with a surreal sensation knowing that this beautiful building was once the headquarters to both the Hungarian Arrow Cross Party (Hungary’s Nazi Party) and AVO/AVH Communist Terrorist Organizations. The building, if not for the iron platform with the words “Terror” adorning its roof, was a beautiful example baroque architecture and the words did little to prepare me for the history of horror that awaited me just beyond the entrance doors.
Before entering the museum I took some time to admire a piece of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain Memorial, a chain sculpture reminding visitors of the city’s dark history during Soviet rule.
The ground floor of the museum consists of the lobby, cafe, cloakroom, restrooms, and ticket counter. After passing through the ticket admission turnstile, I entered a 3-story courtyard that houses a Soviet tank sitting in a reflection pool and a gallery that showcases a haunting display of hundreds of black and white photographs of Hungarians who were the victims of the communist terror organizations.
The museum’s tour began on the 3rd floor where a labyrinth of exhibits guided me through the history of the building’s infamous past; starting with the story of the rise of the Hungarian Nazis (The Arrow Cross Party), the end of the Nazi regime, rise of communism in Hungary, and the resistance. The displays are a fascinating look at how the atrocities of terror organizations impacted the lives of the citizens of Budapest.
After passing through the exhibits of the top floor, the tour descends down a spiral staircase to the 2nd floor. Here I had an opportunity to learn about the history of the AVO/AVH terror organizations and the practices of their secret police. The exhibits feature communist propaganda, the life of people living under communism, the offices of the Gabor Peter, the Head of the Hungarian Political Police, as well as other exhibits to help one understand the terrors the citizens faced during this bleak and dangerous time in history.
From the museum’s second floor, I entered the elevator where the tour’s darkest part was about to take place. Learning about the history of terrors that took place was truly tragic, but what was hidden below in the building’s basement was even more terrifyingly evil.
As I made my way through a through a maze of dungeonous prison cells, interrogation rooms complete with the original torture equipment, execution rooms, and the heart-wrenching Hall of Tears featuring lit crosses in remembrance of the victims whose lives ended here, I was left shaken. Imaging the terror the victims must have felt as they endured days spent subject to horrific torture and worse in these cold grey stone walls was a bit overwhelming, to say the least.
As I exited the tour and stepped back out into the bright daylight and onto Andrassy Utca, my mind was still trying to process the evil that humans can do to one another. It was one of the museums that I wished didn’t exist, but believe must be visited in order to understand that the dark times of history should never be repeated. It was a museum that I will never forget.
The Terror Haus is one of the most powerfully moving museums in Europe and one that needs to be on your Budapest itinerary. The museum is open Tuesday to Sunday, 10:00 am to 6:00 pm and is located at 60 Andrassy Boulevard.

Travelling and seeing as many places as I can is a passion. It has never been solely about showcasing pictures just for the sake of it. It’s always been about the culture, community, language of communication, behaviour of the people, the structures, monuments, the history behind it and more such. It’s about knowing and absorbing and sharing this knowledge through written work and of course images corresponding to them.
Two days spent in Budapest, the capital of Hungary 🇭🇺 was like having been there for a long time. The way we devoured the sights of this city divided in two parts by the Danube River was just nothing short of amazing. This is an enchanting city with a vintage feel. Though the whole of Europe has an old world charm, there are differences in the structures and monuments from city to city.
We left on a Sunday morning by train from Vienna to Budapest with our daughter and family. It took only a little more than two and a half hours. The train was super comfortable where we could play card games with our little grandson who was our chief entertainer. Once there we took local trams and trains, hopping in and out of them to get around. But it was mostly a walking tour with our 4 year old in tow. He had his scooter and stroller when he required them. In his name we took a few ice cream and snack breaks. It was 35 degrees in the scorching sun which we combated with water, hats and sunscreen, running to the shaded parts of the promenades whenever possible.
After checking in at the hotel in Pest, we headed to Vajdahunyad Castle. It is a grand castle which has parts of buildings from different time periods displaying varied architectural styles. Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque. Its facade looks like a fairy tale castle. It’s an amazing amalgamation with a vast garden around it. This castle with vibrant stain glass windows, houses a museum of the Hungarian life over the years. It features their farming culture, use of animals such as cattle and horses. All the floors are lined with portrayals of the village life. Our grandson had an exciting time in the castle museum looking and touching all the stuffed real looking animals. He could even milk a fake cow.
The garden at the castle is vast, well tended and lush.
There is a sinister looking statue of a hooded person in the courtyard. It reminded me of ‘He who must not be named’ or Lord Voldemort from Harry Potter. It is the statue of Anonymus, created by Miklós Ligeti. Anonymus was a 12th-century chronicler whose real name remains a mystery. He served as a notary to King. He inspired the Dracula stories in books and movies. On the outer wall of the castle, there’s also a bust of Béla Lugosi, the Hungarian-American actor who is renowned for his role as Count Dracula in the original 1931 film.
While coming out of the castle grounds, we saw a hot air balloon at a distance. Naturally we walked towards it to go up in the air on it. When we approached the ticket counter and enquired we were told the balloon will go up only at 6 pm. It was only noon time and it was impossible to come back for it. We all felt ‘deflated’ by it.
Budapest is made up of two formerly separate cities, Buda and Pest, which lie on opposite sides of the Danube River. The Chain Bridge, which we saw from a distance, completed in 1849, was the first to connect them. In 1873, the two cities were officially unified under the name Budapest. We remained in the Pest side as we didn’t have time to go to Buda. Perhaps when we come next, we can only cover Buda, which apparently is a classier and more residential part of the city.
In spite of the intense heat, we lingered at the banks of the Danube which reflected the blue of the sky with a few boats floating on it. We saw the majestic looking Parliament building, which is the largest building in Hungary. Built in 1904, it’s a gothic structure influenced by the City Hall in Vienna. It’s declared as a UNESCO Heritage site.
While searching online for places to visit, my daughter came across this powerful memorial. Lined along the riverbank are worn looking cast iron shoes, symbolizing the Jewish victims shot into the Danube during World War II. Seeing it deeply moved me, as it brought the horrors of that time to life. This was created by film director Can Togay and sculptor Gyula Pauer. It honours Jews killed by members of the Arrow Cross Party. Victims were forced to remove their shoes before being shot, their bodies falling into the river. The memorial marks the place where they stood ..only their shoes remained.
The one regret I have is not having been able to go across the famous Chain Bridge to Buda. I looked at it longingly, the beauty of it enhanced by the blue of the Danube. Designed by English engineer William Tierney Clark and built by Scottish engineer Adam Clark, it was the first bridge across the Danube in Hungary. It was opened in 1849.
We stayed in Pest as it’s the livelier side, full of attractions, and it’s where most tourists end up wanting to spend their time in Budapest. It was crowded in the popular squares of the area where we stopped in shaded cafes to have cool drinks. Great for people watching. The Intercity Hotel was very comfortable. We slept well out of sheer exhaustion that night and had a filling breakfast in the morning.
Next day we went in search of The Metropolitan Ervin Szabó Library in Budapest, famous for its vintage interiors. It is a sprawling public library complex, with its main structure in an ornate 19th-century former palace, built in neo baroque style. Unfortunately we could not go into the classical side because there was a film shooting going on. What a disappointment! We had to make do with wandering in the less interesting part where there was a modern lending library. We admired the facade and had lunch at a near by open restaurant with our little hero making up games and running all around. I had an interesting salad with sun-dried tomatoes, red lettuce and Hungarian cheese topped with blueberry marmalade.
We debated going to Buda for a quick visit but we were not sure whether we would get back to the train station in time for our return. We decided to go and see the largest synagogue in Europe which was a few minutes walk away. It is a magnificent structure built between 1854 and 1859. It has twin octagonal towers topped by onion domes which has an oriental touch. The Star of David is embossed into the stone tablets. There is alternating yellow and red brick work on the imposing building ..standing the test of time.
Again sadly we could not go in because it was time to get back to our hotel for our luggage and head to the station. But we were happy to view the awe inspiring facade.
Some of the underground metro stations take you back in time like the late 1800s or early 1900s because of its vintage feel. It is compact and quaint in its tiled look with wooden benches and frames. Took me back into another era. Loved the ageless feeling while waiting for train which itself looked as if it was from another time long past. I visualised suited, hatted gentlemen with their canes or hooked umbrellas and slender women in long frocks and fashionable hats of that time waiting at the station.
I forgot to mention the street book shop that we saw while walking towards the Ervin Sazbo Library. It was heartening to see the lovely colourful cart with hoards of books surrounded by eager buyers. Mostly Hungarian books, so we didn’t delve further. We also passed by a big well organised secondhand book store with books from floor to ceiling.
Though there were hardly any books in English, it was a sight to behold and to be photographed.
On Sunday after our sightseeing and long walks in the hot sun, we went for dinner in a restaurant where they served beverages on little trains. This place was chosen for the youngest and most important traveller in our group. We ordered Hungarian food and drinks. It was fascinating to see the drinks coming on mini trains. There were railway tracks on every table. There was live music by musicians who came from table to table. They played a Greek song for us at our request along with Hungarian and German. It was a unique experience.
On our return train, I dozed off almost half the way vaguely listening to the little fella’s chatter like a lullaby in the background. Felt good to be back to our present turf reminiscing about the two days well spent in Budapest, thanks to our daughter and son in law. A special thanks to the little one for entertaining us all through.

Budapest was such an awesome city! Although not at the very top, it comes a very close second! It is very open and spread out, yet it still had its nooks and crannies to get lost in. The city reminded us of Brooklyn in NY, it had a trendy/hipster feel with a lot of young people. The nightlife was outrageous, with tons of restaurants to eat at and bars to socialize in, for all sorts of tastes. There were parks to lay around in or many shopping streets to keep you busy. There is something for everyone in Budapest… except a beach which is why Barcelona is still our favorite city visited so far.
Budapest has 23 districts and they are usually indicated by Roman numerals. The more central districts, like downtown, have lower numbers while the outer districts have higher numbers. The best districts to stay in are district V and VI as within these 2 districts you can find a lot of the major landmarks & attractions, along with the widest selection of restaurants, cafes, pubs and bars. Most, if not all, are walkable. We barely used the Metro system but it was very easy to navigate when necessary.
There were countless accommodation options in Budapest especially a huge range of hostels. Booking the day before still allowed us over 40+ hostels to choose from. We ended up staying at 11th Hour Hostel and Cinema which was located right in the middle of downtown. Some other popular hostels in a great location are Wombats, Big Fish, Downtown Oasis, Maverick City Lodge.
Szechenyi Baths and Pool — One of the largest spa complexes of its kind in Europe. The entry ticket is (5000 HUF/ 16 €) which includes the usage of a change room, locker, multiple different pools, saunas, steam rooms and fitness centre. We spent a couple of hours here relaxing in the pools & sweating it up in the saunas. Note: bring your own towel & lunch as there isn’t a large selection of food!
Conquer Budapest Walking tour visiting St Stephen Basilica, Matthias Church, Danube Promenade, Chain Bridge, National Opera House, Castle District (Royal Palace, Matthias Church, Fisherman Bastion). Our guide for this was one of our favourites of our Europe trip so far and we’ve done a lot of ‘free walking tours’. The tour was never boring even though we are slowly but surely getting tired of churches and history, he kept it interesting and fun for the whole 3 hours. The Fisherman Bastion is shown below.
Central Market Hall- A 3 story hall combing shopping and eating. Fresh fruit and vegetable stalls, meats, cheeses, souvenirs, shopping and most importantly a selection of food stalls with portions bigger than you can ever imagine. Classic Hungarian dishes are sold here but come hungry and forget trying to count calories.
Vaci Utca — Vaci Utca is one of the main shopping streets in Budapest and also a very popular tourist drag. The street is lined with cute cafes, great shops and a tonne of Thai massage parlours which we indulged in (do shop around).
Margaret Island — A 2.5km long central island laying in between “buda” and “pest”. A very well kept island with ample to do during the summer months. It’s a beautiful spot to spend an afternoon during the spring/summer. The island has a pool, water park, wildlife park & athletic centre. We strolled here from downtown Budapest or you can take the number 26 bus which is the only vehicle allowed on the island.
Gellert Hill — Panoramic views over Budapest. You can climb the Gellért Hill starting at the Elisabeth Bridge near the Gellért Monument, or you can take the steeper route starting at the Gellért Hotel. You can also take a bus or get there by taxi.
Eating in Budapest was a welcomed treat after indulging in so much pasta and pizza in Italy. Hungary had their typical cuisine but also every other type, so there was never too much repeating. It was cheap, the portions were often of a good size and there were countless restaurants to choose from.
Street food is also very common and convenient in Budapest. At Karavan you can find numerous food trucks in this little outdoor area. Perfect for a quick dinner or a late night snack after spending time at the famous ruin bar, Szimpla Kert.
Below is a list of the typical Hungarian dishes you should try if you are to visit the city! And before you finish, don’t be alarmed when we mention that we did eat all of them.. a few times.
You can easily sample all of these on your own throughout the city but if you enjoy food tours then we suggest signing up for one of the many tours Taste Hungary has to offer.
Hungarians typically eat their biggest meal during lunch so many restaurants offer a “Tourist Menu” which involves a three-course meal for less than $6 (100 HUF), this is often cheaper than ordering just one dish. However, when we weren’t eating a 3-course meal, you could find us at some of our other favourite restaurants:
Bors Gasztrobar — Always a line, freshly made baguette sandwiches, homemade soups & cheap cheap!Drum Cafe — Cheap, classic Hungarian food.Fruccola — Healthy, fresh, create your own salads/sandwiches.Magyar — Classic 3 course restaurant with generous portions. Close to the Grand Central Market but surprisingly not a tourist trap as we had first thought.
Just like restaurants, the nightlife options are endless and generally are within walking distance. We weren’t in Budapest over the weekend but each night had something going on.
Some of you may be aware of what a “Ruin Bar” is, some not… well Budapest is famous for these types of bars. It is simply a bar/pub, inside or next to an old building. The buildings have usually been abandoned and turned into bars by decorating them with many different types of objects, such as paper statues, foreign licence plates, unique lanterns and seats made from cushions, old cars, duck tape, you name it. If you use your imagination you can usually get a picture for what they look like. None of the interior makes sense and generally doesn’t have a theme except looking like ‘designed junk’. If the walls aren’t covered with pictures and objects then they are painted.
Some of the most popular Ruin bars in Budapest are Szimpla Kert, Grandio, Instant, Yellow Zebra Bikes & Bar and Anker’T. If you have to go to only one, make it Szimpla Kert! So much fun and so unique. It’s open during the day, so you can get a better look at the interior. Grandio is a hostel as well as a bar so don’t stay here if you’re wanting to sleep!
Gozsdu Courtyard is another popular area in downtown. Although they aren’t ruin bars, the courtyard/long street has a variety of beer gardens and restaurants and is both popular with locals and tourists. Check out Spiler, one of the biggest restaurants in the area with a solid menu both for food and drinks. The lamb burger was super tasty & recommended.
We were really sad to leave Budapest but until next time…..

Budapest is renown for its spas — even the zoo has one, with many animals having their own thermal baths (and, apparently, a very high reproductive rate). On a glorious spring day I stood outside the belle epoch Széchenyi Baths, the phrases ‘taking the waters’ and ‘frequented by royalty’ running through my mind. Even the entrance to the baths was a work of wonder.
Inside was all high ceilings and chandeliers. An authoritarian attendant ushered me into a small change room, returning later to lock my clothes away. I shared my change room with half a dozen others — this was no place for false modesty.
And so, to the waters. Outside were two enormous baths (one at 30 degrees C, the other at 34) with a lap pool between them. Inside were another 15 or so baths, each catering to different needs.

Our complete running guide to Budapest is now on the Great Runs site. Below is a quick summary.
Budapest, Hungary is a wonderful city for traveling, with wonderfully preserved architecture, great restaurants and bars, and a good transport infrastructure. It is the capital of Hungary and the country’s largest city, with a population of 3.3 million. There are lots of great places to go running in Budapest.
The best places to run in Budapest are all centrally located. The highlight is Margaret Island, a recreational mecca with several km of trails with great river and city views. There is also excellent running along the Danube, on both sides, although one should look carefully at our guide to learn the best sections. There are also some great parks for running: City Park (Varosliget), Bikás Park, and Orczy Park. And for some hills, head to Gellért Hill in Buda and run up to the Citudella (fort), or enjoy the more expansive Normafa park, a few km west of the city. One thing that’s unique about running in Budapest is that there are many places with rubberized running tracks, which are dedicated paths for runners. The longest is 5.3 km on Margaret Island. Many of these tracks also feature an open air fitness park, with machines for exercising.
Our full guide to running in Budapest is on the Great Runs site. Click on the links to each of these routes for full description and maps.

December 29, 2024
When you first step into a new city, the vibe tells you a lot. Specially, when you go in without much research, like we did for this one. So, stepping into Budapest after the loud and lively Vienna felt like entering a quieter, more mysterious world. As we climbed up the escalator from the train station, the crisp cold air hit our faces, and the glowing Liberty Bridge appeared in the distance arching over Danube. It was a quiet welcome, and something about it felt right. Calm and inviting — that was our first taste of Budapest.
The walk to our hotel was an easy 10 minutes. Although, in -2°C, dragging suitcases, while our fingers and nose slowly froze, we couldn’t help but admire the streets. That moment, in a way, set the tone for the rest of the trip: embracing the unexpected and finding joy in the little things. My North Face jacket and Alaska-grade boots were doing their job, but Dev, who’s always “too cool for layers,” was clearly questioning his decisions. The streets were quiet, dimly lit, and peaceful — a stark contrast to where we had come from. Tired but content, something about the city felt quietly intriguing.
December 30, 2024
Day 1: When Things Don’t Go as Planned
The next morning, we woke up later than usual. Laundry was the first task of the day — a necessity for anyone packing light on long trips. We tried this for the first time last year during our trip to France and Spain, and it was a game changer. We found a laundromat nearby and got our oat milk lattes while waiting for the cycles to finish. It was a slow start, but it felt good to take our time. Given our type A personalities of always being on the go — Dev, especially — and me being a mix of high-energy and sometimes slowing down, we’ve both been trying to deliberately pace ourselves. This trip somehow made it easier, as if the city’s vibe gently nudged us to slow down and be present. It even tied into my New Year’s resolution. How? I am not going to spoil it for you! You’ll find out towards the end.
Then came breakfast — or rather, the search for it. Most places were closed for the holidays, and Google’s “open now” wasn’t exactly reliable. Isn’t it funny how we still trust Google blindly, even after so many travel time fails? No? Just us? Anyway, we ended up wandering aimlessly for what felt like forever, hangry. Finally, we stumbled upon Napfényes Restaurant and Confectionery, a vegan Hungarian spot. We had vegan versions of authentic Hungarian food, including vegan goulash. The desserts were the real winners: a sponge cake that reminded me of tiramisu and soy yogurt “cottage cheese” balls. We devoured it! When sharing dessert somehow we eat faster! No? Again, Just us?! 😲
We enjoyed a long brunch and by the time we were done it was already noon, so with no specific plans for the day, we decided to just walk along the Danube. The river stretched out, with the Buda Castle standing tall in the backdrop— it was mesmerizing.
While I posed at multiple locations by the river and Dev happily played photographer, a guy proposed to his girlfriend right next to us. I was so in the moment that I missed their moment and realized it when I saw people congratulating them. (You’ll see the exact moment I finally saw it in the picture below) I was so bummed that I missed it, but it also made us feel so warm and happy to see the happy couple! Also, I didn’t forget the usual:
Me: “You never proposed to me like that.”
Dev: “I’ve been on my knees ever since.”
Dude’s got lines!
The foggy walk along the river was really romantic, which explains the proposal as well. It’s an amazing spot to propose — if that’s something you’re considering. Notice the bench, that’s where you can pretend to take a picture from behind while the other person faces the river. Perfect moment to get on your knees. Good luck!
I took this picture of Dev on that same spot before the proposal happened.
As we moved along, we saw a street vendor mulling wine on the side of the road. Unlike the machine-made ones in Vienna, this one was simmering on a stove. We grabbed some, and Dev downed his so fast he claimed, “Fefde jal gaye” (burnt my insides). But it warmed us up perfectly for the evening.
Continuing our walk, we came across the Jewish Memorial — iron shoes lined up along the riverbank. These shoes commemorate the Jews tragically executed during World War II at this very spot. It’s a haunting and humbling reminder of history’s darker moments.
Hungarian Parliament
From there, we turned right and saw it — the Hungarian Parliament — a jaw-dropping masterpiece of architecture. It’s one of the most stunning buildings we’ve ever seen! I had heard it’s even better from the inside, but we didn’t have tickets, and it was sold out due to holidays on that day. So we happily admired the exteriors of this exquisite detailed gothic and renaissance gem! Of course, this meant photos galore. Dev quipped, “Seriously, itni photos li hain ki Parliament Sharma gaya!” (We clicked so many pictures that the Parliament itself got shy!)
After all that, we decided to take a coffee break but we realized we were completely coffee-d out! So, I ordered water — because, fun fact, Europe and dehydration seem to go hand in hand for me. Unless I’m super intentional about drinking water, I always end up forgetting to hydrate. Quick tip: Make sure you sip a lot of water while traveling! Over Dev’s chai latte with oat milk, water, some vegan Lindt chocolate, and some more geeking out over architecture history, we enjoyed the lit up view of the parliament. Dev after over 10 years of being married to an architect is pretty caught up with his architectural history!
Honestly, these little pauses are becoming some of our favorite moments. ❤️
Evening Adventures: Ruin Bars and New Friends
After that, wondering what to do next, we decided to explore a street nearby called Andrassy Ut. After walking that street, we found a small vegan restaurant tucked in a basement. At first glance, we were hesitant, but the cozy, homely vibe inside won us over. The place was run by a mother-daughter duo, with the mother cooking in an open kitchen and the daughter managing everything else. I tried vegan cottage cheese pasta, while Dev had a burger. They were out of their vegan Hungarian goulash, much to my disappointment. After enjoying our meal, we left chatting and laughing, only to realize ten minutes later that our handbag was missing! Dev sprinted back to the restaurant and thankfully , we retrieved it without issue and after some deliberation decided to head to the Jewish Ruin Bars, a must-visit in Budapest. These bars, created in abandoned Jewish factories post-World War II, are now vibrant spots of nightlife. There, we ran into an Indian couple living in the UK and had such a great time talking that we completely lost track of time. By 11 PM — a late night for us — we realized how much fun we’d had and how unexpectedly we ended up celebrating what felt like an early New Year’s Eve with newfound friends. Moments like these truly make travel special!
December 31, 2024
Day 2: Lost and Found on Gellért Hill
We started our day nice and slow, waking up around 10 AM. After getting ready, we headed to Buda for the first time, curious to see what it was all about. Our main stop? The St. Gerard Sagredo Statue on Gellért Hill. Now, this place has quite a story — turns out St. Gerard was a priest who was thrown off the hill for his beliefs. Pretty tragic, but hey, now he’s got this massive statue and a hill named after him. Goes to show, if you stay true to yourself, you can leave a lasting mark on the world. The views from up there? Totally worth the climb. The winding roads to get there — foggy and lined with leafless dark trees — felt straight out of a movie.
From the statue, I got it into my head that we needed to explore more of the hill. I wanted to see the Liberty Statue, Hungary’s version of the Statue of Liberty, perched somewhere higher up in the mountain. So, off we went, walking past fancy mansions and more winding roads. We somehow found ourselves passing the Saudi Arabia Embassy and even saw a mansion that had once belonged to a wealthy family but was sold due to tragedy and is now a museum, I think. It felt like a little adventure in our quest to find the Liberty Statue. Maybe it was the fog, or maybe it was the construction happening around the castle at the top, but we didn’t find the statue.
Eventually, what we did find, was a cozy café called Füge Shop and Café. We sat down, sipped hot coffee, and just chilled for a bit!
As the evening rolled in, we crossed the bridge from Buda back to Pest for our boat tour on the Danube. If you want to see Budapest in all its glory, this is the way to do it. The Parliament and Buda Castle lit up at night? Stunning. If I may get poetic — the Parliament glowed like a golden crown against the night sky, its reflection shimmering in the Danube — a sight to remember. Nothing could stop us from stepping out of the heated seating area onto the deck for better views, and wow, it was worth it. A flock of shadowy black birds danced against the Parliament’s glowing backdrop, the chill of the air felt nice, and the Danube looked majestic as ever. It was one of those quiet, perfect moments for Dev and me, just soaking it all in. Oh, and let’s not forget the Spanish group of revelers who at that moment asked me to take their group shot. I obliged, and my iPhone .5 shot skills made them so happy! It was all happening.
After the hour-long tour, we walked back to our hotel for a quiet New Year’s Eve. Leftovers, packaged dal from Costco (warmed up by the hotel staff, pro move, right? Which the hotel manager noticed and told us, Hungarian tradition says if you eat lentils on new years eve you will have immense wealth the next year, well, we’ll take that!) some snacks, a complimentary bottle of wine from the hotel, video calls with family, some Bollywood party music, a little dancing, and just enjoying each other’s company.
New Years Day — Jan 01, 2025
Day 3: Vampires, Witches, and Spooky Stories
Waking up on the first of January, the first thing that popped into my head was my New Year’s resolution: spend less time on social media. Over the past year, I’d realized I’d developed a bit of an addiction to scrolling. Sure, I love sharing travel pictures for many reasons, but it started to feel counterproductive. (We’ll save that discussion for another day!) So, before I slept on New Year’s Eve, I boldly deleted my Instagram app.
Fast forward to the next morning — I woke up feeling good but immediately wanted to reinstall the app. Classic, right? But guess what? The universe was on my side because I couldn’t log back in! Logging in from Budapest locked me out, and I didn’t remember my password. Taking this as a sign from the stars, I decided to roll with it.
I shared this with Dev over breakfast, and he confessed he could also do with less Reddit and LinkedIn time. Boom — joint New Year’s resolution made! Feeling all kinds of inspired, we got ready and stepped out into a cloudy, rainy Budapest winter.
Eating out on New Year’s Day is tricky. Most places are closed, and the ones that are open are usually packed. Our first stop was a café, but the only vegan option was, literally, a freezing spirulina beach bowl. So we moved on. Eventually, we stumbled upon a fancy Michelin-starred restaurant. It wasn’t entirely vegan, but hey, it sounded like a New Year’s treat. And it was super fancy — the server unfolded my napkin and placed it on my lap. Not the most comfortable I’ve been in a moment!
I ordered a delicious spinach salad with tofu, while Dev went for an acai bowl and fries (the only other vegan options). Oh, and the breads were vegan and delicious. The food was top-notch, and we felt fancy AF starting our year like this. Again, not planned at all!
Next up was Buda Castle, sitting pretty on a hill. Armed with layers of clothing and our enthusiasm, we started the climb — stairs and all. The view from the top was stunning, but man, it was freezing!
Once we reached the castle, we saw massive lines for the museum and ticket counters. After a quick debate, we decided to skip the museum. Why? Because we wanted to be more intentional with our time. Instead of rushing through, we chose to go back to our hotel, relax, and recharge for our evening plans. So unlike us, right? I think it’s all about fighting the FOMO!
Back at the hotel, we couldn’t distract ourselves with our phones (thanks to the new resolution), so we turned on the TV. To our delight, there was an orchestra performance playing — it felt oddly perfect for the day. We snacked on leftovers, took a quick nap, and felt recharged for the evening.
Our evening began with street food (yes, pav bhaji in Budapest!) before heading out for our walking tour. We took a quick stroll around the winter market and the giant Ferris wheel, which had completely baffled me earlier. The blue glow it cast on the sky behind the buildings had left me wondering where it was coming from — until I finally saw the Ferris wheel and it all made sense.
Eastern Europe has a rich history of eerie tales, and this walking tour was a deep dive into them. We learned about Vlad the Impaler, the Romanian ruler who gruesomely killed his enemies. Vlad was later captured by a Hungarian emperor and imprisoned under Buda Castle. This gruesome history inspired the vampire legends we know today, including Dracula!
The craziest part? As our tour guide was dramatically recounting this story, a bystander — Romanian, of course — who was not at all happy about the story, interrupted to say Vlad wasn’t that bad. Who’s to say? Maybe we’ll have to visit Romania to find out. New trip idea alert?
Then there was the story of the Crying Widow, a woman who allegedly ran a hospital in her basement but used the blood of young girls to maintain her beauty. Oh, and another witch apparently ate children straight out of their graves. 😱. By the end of the tour, we were thoroughly spooked — especially since we had to walk down the castle hill alone.
We grabbed a cab back to the hotel that was 5 minute drive away. Not because it was late at night and we were spooked, duh!, only because we had an early start the next day. 😅
That night, we packed up and got ready for our early morning train to Bratislava.
Final Thoughts
Budapest wasn’t what we expected, because we didn’t really know what to expect. It was better. From wandering aimlessly to stumbling upon cozy cafés, and from Gothic architecture debates to spooky vampire tales, every unplanned moment added a layer to our journey. It reminded us that sometimes, letting go of plans is the best way to truly experience a place. The unplanned moments — getting lost, discovering hidden gems, and letting go of rigid plans — made it unforgettable. Sometimes, the best travel stories aren’t the ones you plan. They’re the ones that find you.

Will: Budapest has commonly been part of a list some people call “The Four B’s of Europe”.
Belgrade, Barcelona, Budapest, and Berlin.
These are widely considered the best party cities on the continent. “Party” is subjective, but the common theme between these cities is that they all have robust club and bar scenes that are famous for many reasons. Budapest is unique because the bars have a certain type of grit, which makes them mysterious. They are usually underground, decrepit, and extremely old. But this gives them an indescribable atmosphere.
Carolina: Throughout our relationship, Will and I constantly joke about the ""Hungarian caves"" as we like to call the Budapestian bars. Personally, while my days of party raging are behind me, I do enjoy an occasional ~causal clubbing~ night out and was excited to see what Budapest had to offer.
The expectations were: cheap drinks, quirky bars, and great house music.
If we haven't mentioned it already, I regret to inform you that it turns out Budapest isn't as cheap as they say. We were disappointed to find that drink prices were on par with what we commonly find in the U.S. — $5 beers and $12 cocktails. There were, however, a few spots closer to the local and low-key end of the spectrum that we truly enjoyed.
Kisüzem (1st and 2nd photos above) is a casual sit-down bar on the outskirts of the Jewish Quarter where Will and I got to enjoy $4 beers and $9 cocktails.
It was the perfect place to kick off a night out or even just to grab some drinks and chat. While the vibes of Kisüzem were very relaxed, it was extremely hard to score a table or even a windowsill to sit on outside. Most of the people were chatting in Hungarian — which made it seem like a popular spot amongst the locals.
Will: The most famous (probably) tourist bar in Budapest is known as Szimpla Kert (pictured above). It’s interchangeable with the “ruins bar” and is usually the first result on Google for the query “Best bars in Budapest”. When people say “ruins bars”, they are talking about this place, which is located in the heart of the Jewish Quarter. It’s a little confusing, but it’s not “bars” plural in the sense that there are individual “bars” within the building; Szimpla Kert is a bar that has several places to buy drinks within it. Makes sense?
It’s an incredible space with multiple levels and plenty of room to roam. Inside is straight out of a Jackson-Pollack-painting-come-to-life. Various, random knick-knacks cover the walls and ceiling while each room is draped in vibrant lights. As large as it is, they still manage to pack it night after night, especially in the high season. Caro and I tried to go on a Friday around midnight, and the line was horrid. The appeal of this place is valid, and I’ll say it’s a definite must if you’re planning on going out to Budapest. Price-wise you can expect beers ranging from $5-$9 and cocktails for about $9–$13.
Carolina: Szimpla Kert is truly a sight to behold. A big part of the experience is getting lost in the maze of bars. Each one of them has its unique atmosphere. However, don't mistake this for a bar to go dancing at. While they do play music, there isn't a dance floor. Instead, there are tables where people gather around and sit to talk or play cards like we did.
Will: When it’s time to go dancing, there is one option that could satisfy everybody’s musical taste. It’s called Instant/Fogas, and it’s the most insane club I’ve ever seen. For Caro and I, this was it — the CAVES!
It has 6 (yes, 6) different rooms. On the entry floor, there are two large dance halls, one playing house music and the other playing general pop and throwback dance bangers from the likes of Madonna, Lady Gaga, Brittany, and Black Eyed Peas. The entry floor also has 4 to 5 bars, so getting a drink is no issue.
Downstairs, however, below the street, is where the complexity of Fogas can be truly celebrated. The Fogas underground features three distinct caves: heavy metal & rock, techno, and deep house. Each is separated by thick concrete and has its own bar. Being down there makes you feel incredibly edgy, but downstairs is where Fogas is the most fun. The music is great, the rooms are very spacious, and the overall vibe can’t be replicated. Granted, there are other underground bars in Budapest, but none like this. You feel the mysteriousness and grit of the city in a very unique way.
Carolina: For someone who likes to go dancing and has a Frankenstein music taste like mine, the Instant-Fogas Complex was a dream come true. However, I gotta say that there was another bar that stood out against all others. That was Viadukt, a Danube-side bar hidden underneath the trolley tracks.
During the day, the bar's green-painted metal doors are hard to distinguish from the other ones that are part of the viaduct where the trolly passes through. At night, the road becomes pedestrian-only, a black canopy tent is set up outside with a DJ playing house music sets, and tables and chairs distributed among the Danube bank. The green metal doors are wide open and the inside is decorated with an exhibition from a local artist. There's plenty of space to dance by the DJ and to sit and chat a bit further where the music isn't as loud. Regardless of where you decide to hang out, you get to enjoy the gorgeous lights of Buda across the river as well as a view of the Széchenyi Chain Bridge.
Both Viadukt and Instant-Fogas served their drinks in reusable branded plastic cups which Will and I kept. So, if we host you once we're back home, there's a chance that you might get to enjoy a drink from the cups we brought from Budapest.

I created a video about Budapest, Hungary’s capital, for the “Connecting cities” project. I took these photos while I was with the Erasmus program there, and I wanted to share with you my once in a lifetime experience! Enjoy! #connectingCities
Last year I was given the opportunity to participate in the Erasmus program. The city I was chosen to go was Budapest. As a student there I made a lot of friends, with most of them coming from other countries and cultures. As you can imagine, I broadened my horizons, I shifted my perspective about a variety of things and, as a result, I changed a lot about my way of thinking. My stay abroad was for one academic semester (about 6 months), where I was a student at Karoli Gaspar University! In particular, Erasmus is actually an exchange program between European Universities, in which students from European countries connect, collaborate and share their feelings and ideas with each other, while studying in a foreign country. In this way, students become more open-minded and self-confident.
Now, its time for me to show you some of the main attractions that Budapest is famous for, including what I felt and what I thought while being there. Also, I will try to make a comparison of these attractions to the Greek culture and natural heritage, trying to find out the similarities between these two ostensibly different countries, Hungary and Greece.
To begin with, one of the most famous attractions in Budapest, and Hungary in general, is the Danube river. While gazing the Danube river and its calm waves, I surely admired the serenity and the beauty of Hungary’s nature. It is such a nice place, where there are a lot of small kiosks, coffee shops and restaurants, in which you can enjoy this breathtaking landscape and view. It is definitely a place where even your deepest thoughts can be unfolded. Once, while I was drinking my cup of hot chocolate during a boat cruise through the river, it felt like I was in a sailing boat into the Aegean sea. Instantly, the lyrics of Randy Newman’s song came across my mind… ‘’I am looking at the river but I am thinking of the sea’’. Many feelings passed through me and along with this, the sense of nostalgia of the sea and my country made me feel that I am into the Aegean again.
It is said that one of the best known attractions of Budapest is “The Fisherman’s Bastion”, which was built in the 19th century. The Bastion is a castle named after the guild of fishermen that was responsible for defending the stretch of the city walls in the Middle Ages. At this time, it is a city viewing terrace, with a lot of stairs and walking paths, and serves the best panoramic view in Budapest! It is a spot that many tourists visit, in order to take amazing photos of the view and, of course, themselves, for remembering their holidays! Needless to say, the architectural style and placement of the castle makes you feel like you are a part of a fairy tale, by taking you back in time, especially in the wintertime.
When I started finding out more about the city, I discovered that, not only the close to Danube side of Budapest is amazing, but also the other districts both Buda and Pest. For example, there is an enormous square called ‘’Heroes square’’ in which huge buildings and monuments are exhibited. I recall that a guide was telling us once the detailed history of the square, and we were all amazed about how similar the Greek and Hungarian architecture was. For instance, the Museum’s of Fine Arts designers were inspired by the ancient temples of Greece, and that’s why the front of the building is classical with massive Corinthian columns. Apart from that, its exhibitions contain pieces of art from Ancient Greece and Rome, which is something that made me feel really proud.
In my opinion, Budapest is definitely a suitable place for traveling, but only someone who lives there can ascertain how the everyday life and behavior of its local citizens is. As a student there, sometimes I had reservations about some specific things, such as not being accompanied while walking home. But that’s an apprehension I would have in any city that I am not familiar with. In general, Budapest is considered an overcrowded city and people there are kind-hearten and open-minded, such as many Greeks are.
If you go to the city center of Budapest during the Christmas time, you will find small wooden houses selling traditional Hungarian, sweets, food and art, and everything smells cinnamon and coconut. Its typically called the “Christmas Market” and you will surely have a blast while being there!
While spending 6 months there, I tried to taste all kinds of different traditional Hungarian food. My main conclusion was that their recipes were similar with the Greek ones, but Hungarians use more spices and bigger amounts of garlic and onion. As an example to the above, both Hungary and Greece have a traditional recipe for stuffed peppers. In Greece this recipe is called ‘’Gemista’’, and apart from peppers, stuffed tomatoes and other vegetables may also be included. In Hungary, its called ‘’Töltött paprika’’ and, by default, there are only stuffed peppers included. In Greece, “Gemista” is stuffed with minced meat, rice, garlic, tomato sauce, onions and oil olive while in Hungary, it is stuffed with pork, rice, onion, garlic, paprika and tomato sauce. So, you can imagine how similar these recipes are to each other, despite the small differences that may occur.
Additionally, I need to write about the baroque style that characterizes Budapest. While walking around the city, the roads and the buildings make you feel like you are starring in a mystery movie! Most of European countries are conducted with this architectural style, which is why they are considered to be so “unique” and “special” compared to other countries. In Budapest, you will notice these buildings of Baroque architecture mainly in the castle district, but also in the Szechenyi Thermal baths, the Royal palace and St. Anna’s Church. This style makes the city an absolute architectural paradise!
Now days, there is a situation which many countries are facing, mainly due to the financial crisis that hit the European Union. Unfortunately, in both Budapest and Athens, are a lot of homeless people and their number is constantly being increased. Most of them are living in subway stations, underpasses, parks and areas with high criminality rates. A high percentage of them are drug addicts and alcoholics. The problem in both Budapest and Athens is that there aren’t enough shelters that can provide a descent place to live to those who can’t afford it. So, inevitably, they end up living in the streets. For example, as a solution to this unfortunate situation, the City Hall of Athens is planning to open an overnight shelter for the capital’s homeless, but this kind of plan needs a lot of effort and time to be invested in order to be successful soon enough.In conclusion, we realize that these two cities, Budapest and Athens, have come to deal with poverty due to all the problems caused by the financial crisis. As a case in point, the high level of unemployment was a fatal factor for the loss of many homes, which led to the increased number of homeless people all around the county.
If you are a new Erasmus student, don’t worry, you will quickly make a lot new friends from a bunch of different countries! Erasmus students are very friendly and open to new friendships and experiences. I remember the very first course where we got to meet each other. That course was the Hungarian language one, and my first thought about it was that the difficulty was pretty much the same as the Greek one. All the Erasmus students were joking about the difficulty of the language, and how we could cope with it. We couldn’t even pronounce the words in the right way! It’s really hard to speak Hungarian fluently…
Fortunately, 6 months are enough to find out a lot of hints about living in Budapest, and of course to get along with them too. I have to admit that I am really glad about choosing Budapest as my Erasmus destination. I gained a lot of experiences, felt a lot of emotions and I had the chance to bond with so many people from around the world! I strongly believe that if it wasn’t for Budapest, I wouldn’t be able to understand how much my country relates or differentiates with another one, or how identical or opposite it can be in various aspects! I would definitely not change a thing!

Yes, for sure!!
Budapest is one of the most beautiful, vibrant, and dynamic cities in the country of Hungary. It is the combination of two regions i.e., Buda — A hilly area, and Pest — A flat area, divided by the Danube River in centre.
The Hungarian capital has extremely exceptional sights on both banks of the Danube, a history of over 2000 years, vivid culture, and appetizing delicacies.
Everything you MUST know about the experiences here is as below:
This is one of the most architecturally spectacular and sacred buildings in the city located in the Pest region.
The St. Stephen Square in front of the basilica will give you a whole different feeling during the winters and summers as it comprises of Christmas market and terraces with parasols respectively.
The Basilica consists of a beautifully ornamented interior with statues, mosaics, murals, paintings, and stained glass which will surely amaze you about its history.

Will: We arrived in Budapest extremely hungry (see what I did there?). After disembarking from another lovely Flixbus trip, it was time to find our next home away from home.
Our Air BnB is in a popular area of the city called Oktogon. It’s a lively section of town full of restaurants, bars, shops, hotels, and grocery stores. We had no issues checking into our Air Bnb, and after a brief respite, it was time for dinner. Using our trusty dusty Happy Cow app we found a Mediterranean restaurant cheffing up some amazing salad bowls. Tucked in the Jewish Quarter, the owners welcomed us with big smiles and loaded us up with some felafel balls atop a bed of quinoa, salad greens, beats, and hummus. Post dinner we considered joining the masses in having a few drinks, but the travel day wore us out more than we anticipated. No need to rush it — we’ll be here all month!
Sunday was a settling-in type of day, and we had a mission.
Acquainting yourself with a brand-new city is fun in many ways; we’re learning to see its joy instead of overwhelming ourselves. Google Maps has become our best friend, and finding the most informative local blogs online has become a refined skill.
It might not seem like a real skill, but there are plenty of opportunities to be led astray when relying on the internet.
Carolina: As I'm writing this 22 days after ""moving"" to Budapest, I forget exactly the order of happenings for this day. But, as Will mentioned, we had some missions for Sunday.
For groceries, we gravitated towards Spar since that's the grocery chain we grew accustomed to in Zagreb. However, the Spar location near us wasn't the greatest — the quality of the veggies and variety was subpar, same could be said for their selection of vegan proteins, coffee, milk, and pasta. In the coming days we discovered that just across the street, there was a small local grocery chain (G Roby) that had everything we needed and more.
For the gym, we decided to tour a few spots. First, Nr1 Fitness — a 24/7 gym inside of what seemed to be an office building. As we walked in, we encountered a receptionist who, in broken English, told us that the gym was independent of the offices so she didn't have access to it. We decided to go check it out anyway behind the glass doors. As we did, two gym members came into the building and as they unlocked the doors to the gym, we slipped in with them.
The gym was small but not busy. It was a bit warm but it had everything we were looking for — ""It will be a good sweat session, kind of like hot yoga"" we told each other.
We then walked to 4% Fitness Corner — which is exactly what you would expect from a Budapest gym. House music booming through the speakers, cage-like room dividers, and muscle tees everywhere. It was only $10 extra than the other gym but there was more space, more machines, and the AC worked.
After touring the gyms, we decided to grab lunch and weigh our options. We walked to Kozmosz, an underground restaurant that serves vegan versions of traditional Hungarian dishes. Over chocolate-covered layered cake and coffee, we re-read the reviews for Nr1 and 4% and found out that many people had a hard time canceling their membership with Nr1, asking for a cancelation, still being charged, and not being able to get their money back. Now that's a problem we don't want to have. As we had discovered from our tours, 4% accepted cash payments. Additionally, there were no complaints of scammy business practices.
On the following day, we showed up at 4% and paid a month's worth of cash membership. And just like that, we had a gym.
Will: But what about when you’re suffering from screen fatigue? What is a way to explore a city without a phone? Caro and I have found going for a run works brilliantly.
Carolina: Going on casual runs has to be one of my favorite ways to explore somewhere. I say ""casual"" because the main objective of these runs isn't to hit a specific distance or keep at a certain pace. The objective is to go somewhere you've never been and see new things. To take the the byway just to see what it leads to. In these runs, it's more than okay to stop to take in the scenery, as the objective isn't to run.
That's how we decided to spend our first Sunday evening in Budapest. We ran up the street that connects Oktogon to the Budapest City Park — Andrássy út. Passing by gorgeous buildings such as HAB (Hungarian Art and Business), and the Alice Hotel. To reach the park, we ran around Hero's Square where we got a gorgeous view of the sunset (see picture below).
At the park, we ran aimlessly, allowing ourselves to get lost in the network of trails and pathways that cut through the park. At some point, we found ourselves at a Wine & Food festival (typical) in the shadows of the Vajdahunyad Castle. We also explored the park's extensive recreational sports infrastructures, and of course, the Széchenyi Thermal Bath.
On our way back, passing through the Hero's Square once again, we came across a Star Wars meet-up, over 200 people holding blue and red lightsabers. It was truly a sight to be seen.
Arriving back at Oktogon, we were lured into a local Pizza chain by the smell of baked dough, tomato sauce, and cheese. To my content, they had a veggie pizza option with no cheese. So we wrapped up another wholesome day with 2 slices of cheese-less pizza.

Few days after I came back from Trieste, I had lined up another trip, and this type it was sort of a vacation. Except that it wasn’t, since it was a summer school with a full 9–5 schedule and all that. But it was summer and I was going to be there for a week, so for me it was like taking a vacation trip!
This was my second time in Budapest, since I visited the city previously in 2016, but back then it was November and pretty cold, so I didn’t get to fully experience the city, the agenda was packed so I only got to see a little bit from the night life, which had intrigued me and I knew that sooner or later I would return to finish the job.
Also one big difference since the previous trip was that now I was staying at Pest — the bohemian part of the city, while the first time I was situated at Buda — the part with the hills and castles.
I got a really cheap flight from Skopje, like 40 Euros a round trip, which was a great deal considering that the first time I had to take THREE flights just to get to Budapest and additional two on the way back.
As soon as I got to my accommodation, the Ludovika Kampus Dormitory — which was fairly easy to find, I met my roommates, Pranav from Nepal and Yahya from Pakistan.
Since our dinner was scheduled for later that evening, we went to have coffee in the centre and to do some sightseeing. Some places were familiar to me, the St. Stephen Basilica and the famous Hungarian Parliament (which amazes me every time I see it).
Since Pranav and Yahya hadn’t been to the city before I showed them some of sights that I knew, the weather was great so we took a walk and after that we had some coffee. Soon it was time to go back and to prepare for the dinner where would meet that rest of the participants at the summer school.
The organizers had also provided us with public transport tickets for the whole week, so this was particularly useful since we could use whatever we like — the subway, trams, buses, even ferries!
Soon we met up with the rest of the participants, so there I’d meet the people with who I would spent the next week — Bernat from Catalunya, Silva from Italy, Leonie and Nina from Germany, fellow Balkanian Stere from Romania, Heidi from US/Netherlands, Celine from China, my great friend Vassiliki from Greece, Zuhair from Iraqi Kurdistan and many more.
During the next few days we got to hear some interesting lecture on populism and it’s rapid rise in Europe — but I also got to learn that it wasn’t just a problem that the EU is dealing with, but that the struggle is real for other parts in the world as well.
At that time the situation was also beginning to become complicated in Catalunya and Iraqi Kurdistan — so it was great to share some opinions and discuss the matter.
It was quite nice that we were in Hungary and discussing this topic — since we all know about Viktor Orban and his policy towards refugees. This added another dimension to the discussions and we heard some interesting points, coming from the Hungarian side, or at least some Hungarian experts that took part as lecturers.
So the next five days during the days we we’re discussing and researching this topics, while at nights we were discovering Budapest’s amazing nightlife! One of my favorite things from the Budapest nightlife is the vast number of ruin pubs throughout the city, and during that week we probably got to see like close to 10 different ruin pubs.
The first night we went to my favorite spot, the one that I visited three nights in a row during my last trip — Szimpla Kert! So basically this is like bar, that is set in a garden (or maybe the garden is set inside of a bar) and it has all kind of cool stuff — like old phones, chairs, chandeliers, video arcades — the place has everything, plus some quality drinks and it’s packed with tourists!
The first night we went there with Heidi and Stere, while most of the others were already tired, but the next night we also went to this place and had a great time!
However, during the next few days we got to some see different places and what I can say is that we weren’t disappoint! Budapest has so many ruin pubs to offer, so I’d definitely recommend that if you go there, go to Szimpla Kert for a while, and then visit some other places as well!
So one night we went to this place Golya Presso — also a ruin pub but much smaller than Szimpla but quite similar in a way. A Hungarian friend of mine, Zoltan, told me before that this place was sort of a hub for the leftists, and it definitely had that kind of atmosphere — especially it’s enterier.
Another night we went to this Red Ruin — by the name you can guess what kind place of it was –filled up communist memorabilia and Stalin, Mao, Lenin etc caricatures on the walls.
Has some beer and some palinka there — I have to admit that I could managed to drink just one shot of palinka, since in my opinion it was terrible — rakija is way better than that! We met some crazy drunk people there — one of them was a drunk barking man who scared couple of dogs that were inside the pub (sounds weird but it happened).
One more place that left a good impression on me was this ruin pub called Ankerts, where they had some great draft beer, good music and atmosphere, but unfortunately we didn’t stay there for too long.
During the day, beside the lectures, once or twice we also went around the city, on the Danube bank and it was pretty awesome to watch the sunset there and to have some drinks.
I love this city since it has it all — great architecture with a lot of history, awesome nightlife and good public transport — which means that you can truly get a great experience!
But I’d recommend going there during spring or summer, winter is not really friendly if you want to go and do some sightseeing. Budapest is especially breathtaking at night, with it’s shining lights — the Parliament building is just marvelous at night! The bridges on the Danube are quite the gem too, especially Szechenyi bridge!
I didn’t go to the Buda part this time, since most of the days we had activities and always stayed on the Pest side, which was full of nice surprises on every corner.
On the last day before we departed, actually it was our free day, we took a ferry on the Danube and visited the little riverside town of Szentendre,or as Lilit from Armenia would describe — a Serbian-style art town!
Beautiful small city with a big Serbian minority there and signs around the place that I could actually read — since they were written in cyrilics.
We had great lunch there — gulash inside a bread dish (I guess I can call it like this). We had gulash multiple times that week and other than that I can also remember eating one dessert that was really to die for — called Samloi Galushka.
The rest of the food we had was mostly international — we ate pasta, hummus, pizza, etc.
I guess that it actually was a vacation, beside all of the lectures and discussions, so during that week in Budapest I had fun, met some amazing people again, and learned a lot of new and cool stuff. The last day I had my flight in the morning, so basically it was time to go back to reality once again.

I know this is a blog about photography, but it’s also a blog about the way that we create and interpret imagery. I find Wes Anderson’s films a perfect focal point for this discussion about image, storytelling, and framing. Both because of what people seem to inherently understand about Anderson’s unique aesthetic, and also because of what people regularly misrepresent or ignore.
I’m not going to introduce Wes Anderson because if you’re reading this, you know his films. We all have our favourites- often the films which got us started with his 50s toned, highly symmetrical movies (mine is Rushmore). Today I’ll be talking about 2014’s The Grand Budapest Hotel and later about 2021’s The French Dispatch, because these films present (to me) a progression of Anderson’s use of the cinematic frame as a storytelling device.
Note on history of format and aspect ratio
35mm motion picture film- that is, the film itself- wasn’t a particularly revelatory technology. Industrial processing for 70mm photographic roll film was already established, and filmmaker WK Dickson found that by splitting the roll in half you got two 35mm rolls which were ample enough to capture the image rendered by lenses of the time.
Like many stories in early film history, Thomas Edison stuck his head in, forcing Dickson to spend the next five years attempting in vain to establish a new standard. But in the end and to this day, the economics of 35mm film have kept it as the standard, first capitalising on 70mm film industrialization, and later on its own mass production before any other format had the chance to get off the ground.
Traditional spherical lenses project a circular image. We cut the sides off for convenience and to avoid the outside edges of the image circle, which tend to be blurry. The most judicious use of the image circle (beyond simply leaving it circular) is to square it, which remains the standard in some large format photography. This square is, however, at odds with human perception. Every person experiences vision differently, but with two round eyes spaced apart, we can fairly assume that most people see the world significantly wider than square, and the history of aspect ratio is the economics and technology of rendering a cinematic image that better resembles our own eyes.
Early widescreen was limited by lens and film fidelity. You can only cut so far into your image before degrading the quality, widescreen had some success in using larger format 70mm film, but the most common ratios sat around 4:3. A slightly wider square, which was codified as the Academy Ratio after sound was added to movies.
The 4:3 academy frame was wider than square, without significantly reducing the amount of film (and ergo fidelity) used by each frame. Throughout the 1930s and 40s the Great Depression cut into discretionary spending, 70mm film was considered too expensive to use, and further widescreen advances lay dormant.
By the 1950s, the mainstream adoption of television forced filmmakers to innovate. Widescreen implementations which were as simple as changing the matte in a projector were only possible by letterboxing already small tv screens.
In 1952, 20th Century Fox bought rights to a military technology which allowed for wide angle viewing from inside tanks via oval lenses, and coming out with The Robe a year later– the first film shot in ‘scope’ format. Anamorphic lenses squeeze the image on the way into the film plane, allowing twice as much width to fit into a piece of film. The image is in turn desqueezed by the projector, turning a 4:3 frame of 35mm film into a 1:2.9 image. In 1954 Vistavision was established as a more economical way to widen screens, flipping 35mm negative sideways to give an aspect of 1:1.5 which could be further cropped to 1:2 and the modern television standard 1:1.85 (16:9).
Aspect Ratio in The Grand Budapest Hotel
The Grand Budapest Hotel is a nesting doll of narratives. We open to the shrine of a dead author, a visitor holds a book (The Grand Budapest Hotel), and turns to the author’s picture on the back cover. We match cut to the author in an office in 1985, the author tells us about the way stories fall into your lap once the world knows your an author. The aspect ratio changes to 1:1.85 (16:9).
The film is going to pull this menouvre on us often, and it’s keen to make us aware that multiple threads of storytelling are going to take place. It also wants us to know that these stories are being buffed a little with a polish of nostalgic recollection. When our author calls the hotel, “a picturesque, elaborate and once widely celebrated establishment” we cut again to 4:3, and a bright pink hotel reveals itself against an obvious matte painting and a foreground of dimensionless buildings. This part of the story, the filmmaking insists, is literally flattened by layers of recollection as the author character declares, “The incidents that follow were described to me exactly as I present them here, and in a wholly unexpected way.”
Through the remainder of Grand Budapest the moving frame lines serve to remind us not only that there are multiple timelines, but that each timeline is filtered through its own series of storytellers. Wes Anderson’s visuals get flack for being so easily identifiable, but they have an in-text justification in Grand Budapest, where the further removed our author gets from the action, the more the world takes on qualities of the fanciful and make-believe.
Throughout the film, danger is framed by windows- the Zubrowkan army enter the film via a train window, they are spied through a window in the hotel, and Dmitri’s henchman Joplin pursues Deputy Kovacs, first visible through a bus window: Danger abounds, but the existential threat of war seems almost out of scope with the limitations of the story. In the scene of Gustave’s death the frame is robbed of its intense colour, too raw still for Zero the storyteller (Agatha’s death is given no screen time, only narration over imagery of their wedding.)
Why?
So the movie is a nesting doll of different narratives which get progressively distorted through storytelling. It’s a study in the stories we tell, the people and places, we remember, and how we remember them. But also. Why?
Why 4:3 (1.375:1 for pedants), 1.85:1, and 2.35:1? Each time period in the film lines up with the mainstream adoption of that aspect ratio, and so the changing aspect ratios can be considered another part of the set design, which changes dramatically from timeline to timeline. As the browning halls of the 1968 Hotel are rendered in brilliant pinks and reds when we flash back to 1932, so too does the ceiling of the cinematic frame literally grow taller. The perspective literally grows wider and- perhaps- more nuanced- with the historical perspective. Does the film suggest that we’re so far removed from the 30s that what we can perceive is literally cut off on the sides? It’s for you to decide.
It may seem quite contrived to suggest that the narrowing aspect ratio represents a neglecting of the edges of our historical perception, but evidence for this can be found in the text. Our dual protagonists, Zero and Gustave, are a refugee and a bisexual, respectively. Theirs are stories which have been sidelined throughout history, and positioning them in this historical context- even in what remains a comedic romp for most of its runtime. Asks us as audience to consider what stories and characters like Zero and Gustave have been sidelined.
Wes Anderson’s movies draw attention to their own filmmaking to the point of easy categorisation and parody. But too often I believe people categorise as an easy out from analysis.
The estrangement effect has roots in Chinese theatre and Russian Formalism, but was codified into Western theatre by Bertolt Brecht. Brecht’s aim for the estrangement effect (verfremdungseffekt) was that breaking the illusion, and reminding the audience that they were viewing a piece of fiction would force them to engage with the underlying politics. Wikipedia’s description is quite elegant:
“By disclosing and making obvious the manipulative contrivances and “fictive” qualities of the medium, the actors attempt to alienate the viewer from any passive acceptance and enjoyment of the play as mere “entertainment”. Instead, the goal is to force viewers into a critical, analytical frame of mind that serves to disabuse them of the notion that what they are watching is necessarily an inviolable, self-contained narrative. This effect of making the familiar strange serves a didactic function insofar as it aims to teach the viewer not to take the style and content for granted, since (proponents argue) the theatrical medium itself is highly constructed and contingent upon many cultural and economic conditions.”
“Disclosing and making obvious the manipulative contrivances” may not be Wes Anderson’s obvious aim, but the fact that his films are so readily categorised and broken down may at least hint that the estrangement effect is in place. And what are the politics of The Grand Budapest Hotel? It concerns two fringe identities in the face of encroaching fascism.
It is in this way that Grand Budapest is tidily packaged in that thematic dichotomy can be found in the visual aesthetic, and the two feed back into one and other: The rose-tint of nostalgia against the cultural trauma of fascism.
It can seem counter-intuitive, when one of the major criticisms levied against Anderson’s films is that they hide lack of substance behind beautiful aesthetics. But if we consider that the opposite may be true, can the lush aesthetics of The Grand Budapest Hotel, especially during the aesthetic rug-pull of the tawdry 1968 hotel, be hiding its politics precisely within its visuals? The set designs of Grand Budapest Hotel took inspiration from ski resorts rendered in photochrom, a method of colouring black and white photography by hand. They appear stunning in their subtle pastel palettes. But at the same time, the colours they claim to represent are entirely fabricated- left to the artistic choices of the colourist. The hyperreality throughout The Grand Budapest Hotel reminds us that all is not what it seems, and the centering of characters who would have been sidelined by fascism and other historical oppressions serves to challenge our romanticised notions of pre-war Europe.
Which brings us back to the box. The shape of the box in which the Grand Budapest Hotel plays out literally changes shape throughout the movie. Within, it helps guide us through jumps between time periods, but outside of the box, the changing shape serves to remind us that it is the box that we are watching. That this is a fictionalised, romanticised and nostalgic rendition of a far different reality. I think, if you’ve been willing to follow me this far, the characteristic Wes Anderson visuals and irreverent humour do credit to this film. They make the film appear beautiful and whimsical, but in doing so, challenge the viewer to contemplate what parts of a story remain too painful to tell, what has recollection- and history in turn- brushed outside of the frame?

I knew the Danube River and Hungary at a very young age because of piano — Johann Strauss’s “The Blue Danube”. Nearly 15 years later, in 2014, I finally paid a visit to Hungary.
The Danube river is like a belt twining in the mid Europe. Budapest, straddles the banks of the Danube River, and the buildings in the city are pearls on the Danube belt. I arrived at Budapest at the end of April, as an unprecedented heat wave washed over Europe — from Berlin ,Warsaw, Krakow, Prague, to Budapest, the heat wave was chasing me, along with sudden showers that often arrived late afternoon. When it was not raining, the earth was shrouded in heat radiation.
Budapest used to be two cities — Buda, and Pest. Buda was the capital city, and is presently the capitol. Across the river, Pest is 2 times bigger, where most of the city residents live.
The front foot of Pest was already in modernity, everywhere is Costa Coffee,European version of Starbucks, and every car has a European Union’s license plate, indicating the reform and transition of Hungary; and the back foot was still halted in the old time, as trolleys in 1950s styles were still running, and the marble exterior of most buildings were with had turned into yellow over the years. Pest barely had urban forestry. Exposure to excessive sunlight in late April had melted my skin, as if was some sort of ice cream. Perhaps a while back ago, Pest did have sufficient street trees, but those trees withered. There were always a few corners of the street, full of overgrown glasses, existing there alone without the accompany of street tress.
I did some of my schoolwork (I was an exchange student in a university at Germany) on the first night at a Costa. The coffee shop was quite empty, I was facing a window covered by raindrops that look like crystal sticking on the glass window, reflecting the night light on the street. Only one waitress was serving behind the bar, and she was as young as me. I biked along the river bank crossed the bridge between Buda and pest, again and again. Even Pest was where most of the city population resided, its streets were quite empty, besides a bunch of tourists sitting on the outdoor seating of the cafés around the street corners.
Then the late afternoon rain started dropping. I hided in a Costa Coffee until the rain died down. I paddled the bike over the stone road shining like mirror after the shower. When I got back to the hostel we stayed, I ordered some dishes from the Turkish restaurant across the street — Budapest used to be the biggest Jewish populated city. Millions of Jews were transported to Auschwitz from this city. It’s also the biggest resided city of Romanic people, now, it also a population of Turkish immigrants.
I fled to a Costa coffee until The last night at Budapest, before our departure back to Germany, we met our temporary roommate in the hostel, a Korean lady, around 40 years old- she was single, just quitted her job, flied from South Korea to the European continent, travel alone around Europe. She slept on the upper level of the bunk bed, above me.

Hi there! Maeghan & Oli here - we're taking a break to travel the world and hope you'll join us for the ride. 🌏✈️ 👫 www.alittledetour.ca

We’re not going to lie, Maeghan was a little upset to learn that the Grand Budapest Hotel didn’t exist in real life…. but with everything that we heard about Budapest, she felt optimistic with the our next destination.
Budapest was fantastic. We walked around most days exploring the city and eating great food. There were so many different craft beer bars and bottles shops, this is the first time we didn’t have a chance to hit them all! Budapest was also super popular with stag parties and student travellers — I guess it is just that time of year.
We also hit a snag when we had our first encounter with bed bugs in our Airbnb downtown. But our skills as backpackers has reached a new level of awesome and we had identified the problem, found a new place, packed our bags and were out of there in under 15 minutes.
Other than that, we loved it here so much, we decided to extend our stay not once, but twice 😊
See more on our website www.alittledetour.ca🌏✈️👫
On our second day in Budapest. Maeghan was sitting on the couch journaling and Oli was on his computer researching. We decided to switch places so we could recharge our devices and Olivier went on a hunt to find another power outlet. He looked behind the couch and noticed a tiny little bug on the wall in the living room…. it looked kind of like a bed bug…
So he grabbed a spoon, put the little guy in a glass and started a fine eye search to see if there was more. Well… there was.
Olivier found a dozen or so dead bed bug bodies (or a high confidence they were after looking at Google) and put them on a paper towel. Maeghan called the Airbnb host to ask him about this.. since Olivier kept finding more and more bodies and the skins of the bugs inbetween all the crevases of the couch.
Our host said they had bed bugs a few weeks ago, but had the exterminator come twice.. and not to worry unless we found a living one… and we did..
So within 15 minutes… we had their bags packed, space cleaned and they were ready to peace — with success. No bed bugs were carried and they found a new nicer Airbnb all in the nick of time!
The 2nd largest thermal pools in the world next to Iceland. We hope to visit both!
We saw this and thought of all our PasswordBox friends❤️. Ping Pong was an intense sport in the office, we had two and there would always be tournaments.. or two co-workers battling it out. But this seems like a new level of ping pong!
Ruin bar. Made in the ruins of an old building and furnished with only 2nd hand things. Also, has 18 bars in the one location — so you can go to the wine bar, gin bar, craft beer bar… etc. The best place for any group party!

Let me tell you something upfront — Budapest isn’t the kind of city that screams for your attention like Paris or New York. It doesn’t shove its famous landmarks in your face. Instead, Budapest whispers. It draws you in quietly, one crumbling facade, one steaming chimney, one café window at a time. You don’t just “visit” Budapest — you drift through it.
I’ve walked these streets on misty winter mornings when the Danube looks like a silver ribbon cutting through the grey, and I’ve wandered them under the lazy orange glow of summer evenings when locals sit outside sipping fröccs and laughing like they’ve got all the time in the world. Budapest’s charm lives not only in its grand buildings but in the cracks between them.
This post isn’t about the tourist checklist. You already know the Parliament building looks like a gothic wedding cake and that the Chain Bridge is Instagram-worthy from every angle. I want to talk about the streets, the people, the smells, the awkward little corners where life in Budapest feels raw, imperfect, and utterly human.
You know you’re in the real Budapest when the sidewalks get uneven. The main boulevards — Andrássy Avenue, for example — are polished and postcard-perfect. But duck into the side streets, and suddenly the city exhales. Laundry flaps in courtyards, tiny grocery stores glow under flickering neon, old women with floral scarves shuffle along clutching plastic bags, and young students sit on crumbling stoops scrolling on their phones.
There’s graffiti here — some of it art, some of it just bored teenagers marking territory. But the layers of history are impossible to miss. You’ll pass an art nouveau balcony hanging precariously over a 1970s shoe repair shop. Above, the cracked stucco peels like old paint, revealing the city’s stubborn spirit underneath.
Walk around District VIII — Józsefváros. It’s raw, rough around the edges, but it’s real. Here, hip cafés with Edison bulbs and oat milk lattes sit side-by-side with corner bars where old men drink Unicum and mutter about politics. If you want shiny, sanitized Europe — this isn’t it. But if you want life? Welcome to Budapest.
Budapest has a specific smell — part bakery, part car exhaust, part sweet paprika floating from someone’s kitchen window. And yes, sometimes a hint of cigarettes — Hungarians smoke like it’s still 1995. But that mixture? It feels like a real city. A city where people live, not just pose for photos.
Stop by a pékség (bakery) in the morning. The langos might already be sizzling in oil, but most locals are grabbing simple pastries — kifli (crescent rolls), túrós batyu (sweet cheese pockets), maybe a slice of pogácsa (savory scone) if they skipped breakfast. Coffee? Strong. Cheap. No nonsense. Just the way it should be.
Here’s what I love — Budapest locals don’t care that you’re a tourist. They’re not rude, they’re not overly friendly — they’re just… doing their thing. If you want to fit in, keep your voice down, your head up, and your eyes open. Don’t expect big grins and “How’s your day going?” — this isn’t Disneyland. But ask for directions? Most people will help. Stumble through a few words in Hungarian? Their eyes soften immediately.
My favorite? Watching older folks play chess in the parks, completely oblivious to the TikTok kids filming dance videos nearby. It’s two worlds colliding — but that’s Budapest.
Skip the overpriced tourist menus on Váci Street. Head to the side streets for hearty, grandmother-approved meals. Goulash soup in a steaming ceramic bowl. Crispy duck legs with red cabbage. Cheap, buttery nokedli dumplings. It’s heavy. It’s filling. It’s perfect for cold evenings when your breath fogs the air.
And the bakeries? Let me say it again — never underestimate a Hungarian pastry.
Okay, let’s get real for a second. Budapest might feel like another world, but getting here isn’t rocket science.
Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport (BUD) welcomes budget airlines and major carriers alike. From most European cities, flights hover around €30–€100 if you book smart. From the US? Expect around $500–$800 round-trip, depending on the season.
Skip the overpriced taxis at arrivals. The 100E Airport Bus runs straight to the city center for about €5. Runs every 20 minutes. Easy.
It wasn’t the fancy cafés or grand architecture. It was this random Tuesday morning in early spring. Light drizzle. Streets still wet from rain. I ducked into a tiny coffee shop off Kálvin tér. The window fogged up as I sipped bitter coffee and listened to Hungarian indie rock playing softly. Outside, people hurried past with umbrellas, the city carrying on, oblivious to my little moment of stillness.
That? That’s why I travel. Not for the bucket list. For the seconds in between.
Budapest is rough around the edges, sometimes crumbling, often unpredictable — but never fake. It doesn’t try to impress you with perfection. It lets you discover its flaws, its beauty, its rhythm — and decide for yourself.
You might not “fall in love” instantly. But give it time. Walk the streets. Breathe in the mix of pastry, paprika, and city life. Listen to the language you don’t understand but somehow feels familiar.
And when you leave? You’ll miss it — I promise.

We exited Szimpla Kert and stepped out into the dark, rustic alleys of Budapest. The fragrant fall air of late October brought hints of change, and this once-ruined city at night gave the impression we were traveling in another world.
While walking the streets in that state of traveler’s bliss, we joked about the twists of fate that had brought the two of us to this place, still buzzing on the beers we had shared in a vintage bathtub in the maze that was the ruin bar we had just left.
As we passed through the alley, a figure moving against the crowd was nonchalantly listing out choice substances to no one in particular, not-so-subtly soliciting interest.
The indulgences of the night had lulled me to let my guard down, and so I thought nothing of her flagging the guy down in the crowded street, and inquiring about the availability of some grass. There were two of us, and just this one man, so what risk was there?
As they conducted a transaction in hushed words, I felt no cause for alarm. My friend was confident in these kinds of situations and…

This article is a postscript to a previous article I wrote about how Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel uses a timeline of cinematic technology and formatting to differentiate nesting framing devices. Hinted at but slightly outside of the scope of that article was Anderson’s use of theatrical techniques. Specifically- in echoing Brecht’s Epic Theatre. The Grand Budapest Hotel deals directly with fascism, so it seems worthwhile to compare the Marxist and antifascist underpinnings of Brecht’s technique, with the ways Wes Anderson succeeds (and fails) to employ them.
One of the primary goals for the establishment of the Frankfurt School was to interrogate why the German Revolution of 1918 ended the way it did. How did the birthplace of Karl Marx find itself at the end of a political upheaval turning to the allures of capitalism, and ultimately, fascism?
Bertolt Brecht’s Epic Theatre is one of a number of artistic forms which attempted to side-step the motivations of capitalism and to speak directly to his audience. I am no Brecht scholar, and a lot of nuance will be glossed over in this article, however put as simply as possible Epic Theatre employed a range of techniques aimed to snap their audience back into reality. And where were they really? They were in a theatre, watching a play.
Brecht thought that by refusing to let his audience suspend their disbelief, he could force them to engage with the ideas and values of his play, rather than getting lost in investment in the character’s emotional journeys. Brecht was a Marxist, and the ideas and values his plays contained were often specifically anti-capitalist ones. Some thinkers of the Frankfurt School further theorised on these techniques, which we’ll talk about later in this article.
“I find Bertolt Brecht’s epic form, only out of focus, muddied by the bourgeois values of the neoliberal era.” says G.D. Brown of Wes Anderson’s most recent film The French Dispatch in a fairly incendiary Popmatters Article.
No matter Wes’ personal politics, his work is forged in neoliberalism. No matter how artistically successful any viewer may find his works, it is the box office that decides whether Wes Anderson keeps making movies. Furthermore, if he does aspire to the same revolutionary art which forged the Brechtian aesthetic, it is not apparent from his subject matter, nor his frequent brand collaborations.
“It is hardly a wonder that Anderson has directed commercials for SoftBank and American Express, for the likes of Stella Artois, Prada, H&M, AT&T, Hyundai, and Sony. His highly-stylized advertisements have connected common products and the arms of finance to sophisticated notions of film as elevated art, to visual reassurances of certain standards of taste and cultured cool. Of course, Anderson is not the first director of artistic merit to commercialize his talents. Supper won’t pay for itself.” G.D. Brown, Life After Brecht: Wes Anderson’s Lowbrow Dialectics
For Brown, the neoliberalism of Anderson’s aesthetic is rotten to its core: Its themes of minority identity under fascism function as appeals to the comfort of modernity rather than provocative calls to action. Indeed, the communists in Grand Budapest are just as hostile and threatening to the film's protagonists as the fascists (whether the communists depicted in Grand Budapest represent anything like actual communism is outside of the scope of this article.)
“In Brecht’s plays, his cues leading audiences away from the naturalist immersion of storytelling and toward the theater as an unreal portrayal (his breaking the fourth wall, his narrators and movements into song, and so on) were meant to prod the viewer into meaningful engagement with their own historical circumstances…
Anderson has faced criticism for his portrayal of largely white, upper-class characters in contrast with the roles of workers and people of color. As the viewer becomes aware of Anderson’s on-screen values, they must, like Brecht, take on the dialectical mindset to best understand the infusion of revolutionary form and bourgeois content, placing Anderson in the context of the neoliberal turn of the last half of the 20th Century.”
— G.D. Brown, Life After Brecht: Wes Anderson’s Lowbrow Dialectics
The accusation- for those who find this style exhausting (and I’m aware my writing often falls into this style)- is that Wes Anderson uses the stylings of revolutionary art, which is real and important. However, he uses them as a hollow appropriation. Anderson (though not necessarily through conscious intention) is packaging up the Brecht’s technique the same way he packages up other high-brow aesthetics (fine art, high fashion), resulting in an easily digestible remedy for intellectual and class anxiety.
An excellent quote from Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello’s The New Spirit of Capitalism, (which I pilfered from an also great Broey Deschanel video) spells out the process by which contemporary capitalism consumes and repackages revolutionary ideas, saying:
“To maintain its powers of attraction, capitalism therefore has to draw upon resources external to it, beliefs which, at a given moment in time, possess considerable powers of persuasion, striking ideologies, even when they are considered hostile to it.”
— Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello, The New Spirit of Capitalism
Conversely, it could be argued that this form of neoliberal media is the necessary conduit to deliver revolutionary ideas to a mainstream audience. In The Andersonian Theatricality by Irene Kalesi, Anderson’s use of humour is explored as a cloak through which to smuggle critique and revolutionary ideas. Having made the link to Brechtian technique, Kalesi writes:
Comedy when used accurately can be the harshest judge of situations and the greatest fighter for change. Jones points out that “comedy is a vehicle for subtly (or not so subtly) addressing these injustices by mocking the social norms in the hope of slowly changing the masses’ beliefs about the inequalities”. Therefore, the employment of comedy can be pointed towards parodying and thus criticizing war and the collapse of the social ideals. The comedic atmosphere helps the audience engage with the film’s sensitive topic, namely a story that takes place during a tumultuous historical period. This bittersweet story needs the comedic perspective in order to avoid being an overly emotional burden on the viewer. The power of theatre is that it helps the audience not to identify with a character per se but it makes them contemplate deeply about the events happening on stage. According to Aristophanes, serious matters should be touched by the genre of comedy. As Dicaepolis from “Acharnians” says: “Comedy too can sometimes discern what is right. I shall not please but I shall say what is true”. Therefore, the power of comedy is to reveal truths and centralize issues that concern the spectators.
— Irene Kalesi, The Andersonian Theatricality
In Marxist theory, praxis is the putting of theory into action: it can be used to emphasise the importance of engagement and activity toward a common goal, without dismissing the importance of theory.
So does Wes Anderson’s work, specifically The Grand Budapest Hotel, hold up to the criticisms of the Frankfurt School aestheticians who created the groundwork for understanding Brecht’s epic theatre? I’m not uniquely qualified to tell you. But we can try to chase the logic down together: Writing specifically about Brecht, Walter Benjamin wrote:
“The task of epic theatre, Brecht believes, is not so much to develop actions as to represent conditions. But ‘represent’ does not here signify ‘reproduce’ in the sense used by the theoreticians of Naturalism. Rather, the first point at issue is to uncover those conditions. (One could just as well say: to make them strange.) This uncovering (making strange, alienating) of conditions is brought about by processes being interrupted.”
— Walter Benjamin, Understanding Brecht
And furthermore:
“Epic theatre casts doubt upon the notion that theatre is entertainment. It shakes the social validity of theatre-as-entertainment by robbing it of its function within the capitalist system. It also threatens the privileges of the critics. These privileges are based on the technical expertise which enables the critic to make certain observations about productions and performances. The criteria he applies in making his observations are only very rarely within his own control; he seldom worries about this, but relies upon ‘theatre aesthetics’ in the details of which nobody is particularly interested. If, however, the aesthetic of the theatre ceases to remain in the background, if its forum is the audience and its criterion is no longer the effect registered by the nervous system of single individuals but the degree to which the mass of spectators becomes a coherent whole, then the critic as he is constituted today is no longer ahead of that mass but actually finds himself far behind it.”
— Walter Benjamin, Understanding Brecht
This leaves us at somewhat of a junction in considering Anderson. Is the Andersonian Aesthetic a reproduction of these ‘theatre aesthetics’, or does the use of theatrical technique and aesthetic in a cinematic context alienate the viewer from more conservative cinematic techniques? I think your opinions about neoliberalism may define where you sit.
If all revolutionary aesthetics are consumed and repackaged under capitalism, is praxis in media possible? Herbert Marcuse, another thinker of the Frankfurt School, was slightly more optimistic.
“It seems that art as art expresses a truth, an experience, a necessity which, although not in the domain of radical praxis, are nevertheless essential components of revolution”
— Herbert Marcuse, The Aesthetic Dimension
Marcuse took it one step further than Benjamin in that he believed it was the authentic artistic experience that anyone could encounter the thirst for revolution and come to sympathise with the failings of capitalism. Whether Wes Anderson’s art hits even this bar for authenticity is again up to personal judgment.
That capitalism will, in time, homogenise all cinematic aesthetics into a sort of grey sludge seems inevitable. You can see it happen in real time. But hangers-on like Wes Anderson, who thrive in a space that is alternative if only by degrees- these artists may well be the first glimpse of real art many filmgoers experience. Can intellectually honest ideas be mined from these works? This writer believes that even if they can’t, you ought to look.

When I was younger, single with not many cares in this world, I traveled quite a bit. I still do but it’s different now.
I was fortunate to work for a company based near Bristol, England. Once or twice a year I would travel to our corporate offices for meetings and/or training. Lucky me!
I would almost always take advantage of being overseas and book my vacations from there. Inexpensive flights to European cities made it a no-brainer.
One of the trips I took was to Budapest. I was quite spoiled as I acquired hotel points that allowed me to stay in hotels I would not have otherwise been able to afford.
Like the Marriott right on the Vltava River overlooking the Chain Bridge and Castle Hill. This was the view from my room.
I spent five or so days wandering around. For three of those days, a co-worker friend flew over and met me. It was nice to have someone to hang out with for a few days.

The more we observe a city, the more apparent it becomes that it surpasses the sum of its parts. It resembles a colossal, intricate organism with its network of organs and unique internal dynamics. These dynamics are a tapestry woven from our daily interactions within the city: the bustling morning and evening rush on the tram or subway lines and leisurely strolls along the riverbank — it all contributes to this vibrant tapestry.
Though it sounds idyllic, it stands worlds apart from the vast data streams of corporations, the omnipresent data visualization tools, the ongoing buzz about artificial intelligence across various platforms, or even the fundamental essence of artistic expression — music.
“Melody of Budapest,” sponsored by Telekom Hungary, aims to bridge these divides by transforming the city’s dynamic mobility patterns into a musical piece using data science and AI. Initially, Janosov and the data team of Telekom Hungary processed large-scale cell tower-based mobility data at a resolution of 100m into digestible information. This unpublished data covers the temporal and spatial specifics of every mobile phone event on Telekom’s network in Budapest, Hungary, from June 2022 to 2023, linked to their…

Dear Margaret,
I traveled home to Hungary several times since I moved to France, the last time we met. I always just ran through the city to catch my connection to my home town and never stopped by to embrace the beauty of it again. Since you moved abroad too, there was nothing to keep me here for longer.
This time, it was different. My boyfriend came with me and I started to look at the streets we used to walk distinctly — like I’ve never seen them before, like an actual tourist.
At first glance, it seemed like everything remained the same — your favorite art nouveau buildings, the century old parks, historical squares… If only those walls could talk!
Yet, everything seemed changed. It’s been only 4 years since we said our goodbye here but it feels like decades have passed.
I took my boyfriend to the Danube river, or as we call it in Hungarian: Duna, for a stroll taking advantage of the last warm days of summer. I never noticed before how green our capital is, did you Margaret? I don’t recall if we ever talked about it.

We arrived in Budapest after traveling for twenty-two hours. We were tired.
My husband and I were new to river cruising and decided to get our feet wet with what some call the grand-daddy of Viking cruises — The Grand European Tour.
This cruise would take us from Budapest to Amsterdam over two weeks on the Danube, Main, and Rhine Rivers through the heart of Europe. We had no idea what to expect on our first night.
Before dinner, I asked if my husband could walk through Budapest with me across the famous Chain Bridge. I knew he was tired, but for me — he said yes. I had explained that we’d be departing the next evening before the city was lit and I wanted to get some photographs.
I’m blessed with an adoring and amenable husband. He knows one of my life’s greatest pleasures is taking photographs—especially on a trip.
When we left the ship, we weren’t ready for the beauty of Budapest at night. This walk over the Chain Bridge from Pest to Buda, on that first night, is one of my favorite and most beautiful parts of our European river cruise vacation.

Recently, I was on a river cruise through the Lower Danube on AmaWaterways with Christian (TellMeWhyTravel). The stops along the way included Budapest, Hungary, Bratislava, Slovakia, Durnstein, Salzburg, and Vienna, Austria. All of the cities are known for its historical importance from war, due to their strategic location on the river, to arts and culture, where some of the greatest minds which ever existed created. However, by the time you’ve gotten to this page, you already know about Mozart, the Hungarian Parliament, Buda Castle, and the other tourist attractions your tour guide will show you. As our tour guide YOLO (Yes! That’s his name!) said, “Do you see ABC? ABC, another bloody church, additional broken castle.” While I can respect the art and architecture, and the blood, sweat, and tears that went into the churches, castles, and monuments of the era, once I’ve seen one (or two) I’ve kind of seen them all. (There are definitely some cool churches and castles but that’s for a different story!)
I’m going to take you off the beaten path and show you some of the art and culture of today in these cities. Today’s obscure artists will be the Mozart’s, Picasso’s, and Spielberg’s of tomorrow. The Internet has brought most of the things to our homes but art is something we must experience in person!
If you’re staying at the Aria next to the Church of St. Stephen, you’re in a good place to start.
Most of the museums are within walking distance between 1–3 miles and you’ll get to see the other landmarks of Budapest along the way!
So let’s get started!
Want to check out some contemporary art museums further up?
Both of these museums looked pretty cool, unfortunately the Q was temporarily closed for installation.
If you’re already tired or didn’t see anything interesting you can check out the Széchenyi Thermal Bath, which features 18 pools and saunas but also has an exciting retro architecture, which reminded me of high school.
But maybe you’re not done yet. Walk down past the ruin bars to the Palace District.
Have a drink or two here, usually you’ll find some live music, poetry reading, or lively conversation!
From here there are a few advanced options:
About 25 minutes away is the Ludwig Museum, related to the Mumok in Vienna. It’s worth seeing some of the collection which includes Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, and Joseph Beuys.
Cross the bridge and at the base of Gellért-hegy Jubileumi park is Faur Zsófi Gallery. We hiked to the top of it, but the park is still undergoing renovations but a stunning view nonetheless.
Also closeby is the music venue A38, where we were lucky enough to see the band Henge.
Not tired yet? Cross the chain bridge and get to the Buda side of the city.
In the oldest part of the city, Obuda, stands a shrine to one of the city’s most famous contemporary artists, Victor Vasarely, the father of the optical art movement.
Then cross back over to Pest and hit Kalman Maklary Fine Arts an interesting contemporary gallery (no exhibitions this year yet) which is close to parliament and a short stroll from the Aria.
If you happen to come in mid October, check out Art Market Budapest which is also near the first round of galleries near the opera house and the Aria.
Now if you didn’t finish all of that in your two day pre-cruise, don’t worry, you’ll have a chance to come back at the end of the cruise!
Sailing
The Slovak National Gallery is close to where the ship docks.
Three options for the outskirts of the city; I don’t think you can walk here, you might need to take a taxi, bike, or public transportation.
Rudavskys Magic Garden: The garden is closed for the winter, but looks incredible when it’s warmer!
The Július Koller Society
Tranzit
Danubiana Meulensteen Art Museum: This looks like a very cool museum atop a peninsula jutting into the Danube. I didn’t see it from the ship, but along with its sculpture park, it seems like an awesome place to check out the latest contemporary art!
Sailing
The next stop is in the Wachau Valley, specifically Durnstein. While Durnstein is a quiet town with not much contemporary art, 8km from Durnstein is a small cosmopolitan town, Krems an der Donau, with some interesting art options.
The map is zoomed out to show the proximity to Durnstein where the ship is docked.
Sailing
The following day we docked and took about a 90 minute bus ride to the quaint city of Salzburg, known for being the birthplace of Mozart. It’s also known for being the backdrop to the 1960’s classic The Sound of Music.
The city is surrounded by a steep rock face which made it an impenetrable during times of war. However, the top of mountain is a contemporary art museum. You get natural and manmade art from the top of the elevator ride!
But before we get there, global gallery Thaddaeus Ropac has two locations in Salzburg! Check to see if there are exhibitions at the farther one near the train station before you trek up there.
Finally, Galerie HAAS & GSCHWANDTNER is moving from its downtown location to somewhere else within Salzburg. Check their website to see where they end up!
Sailing
We made it! Vienna, Austria the largest, most cosmopolitan city on the Danube. The art scene here is huge with tons of galleries, museums, and history.
We will try to avoid the two most famous artists from Austria, Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt, because the Neue Gallery on 86th and 5th in New York houses Ronald Lauder’s huge collection of Austrian art including Klimt’s Lady in Gold.
The bus to old city will drop you about 5 minutes northeast of St. Stephen’s Cathedral.
There are a lot of galleries in the first district, here’s the east side of the city first.
The west side is next, the order is assuming that you are coming from the bus drop off location
On the east side of the outer museum loop
There are a few major art fairs that take place in Vienna:
March: Spark Art Fair
May: Affordable Art Fair
September: Vienna Contemporary and Curated By
November: Vienna Art Week
Austrian artists that I didn’t get a chance to see:
Stefan Eins: He stopped by my Times Square exhibition multiple times and had some crazy stories about when he started Fashion Moda in the South Bronx in the 80s.
Andre Heller: Multi-hyphenate who commissioned Luna Luna
Helmut Lang: the famed photographer
Franz West: Sculptor and artist
On the outskirts of the city is the Essl Museum, which houses what is considered the most important collection of Austrian art after 1945.
From here the ship sails back to the beginning port, Budapest.
Did we miss something? Drop a comment and we’ll be sure to check it out next time and let you know how it was.
Interested in recreating this experience? (You’ll now have the maps to save time instead of us stumbling around)
Here’s the link to the AmaWaterways cruise and the Aria hotel, which is voted the best in Central Europe consistently!
NB: There was an issue with Google Maps acting weird so instead of wasting time figuring it out, I made different maps for each art “district” in Budapest and Vienna.

There is a certain pattern I notice in cities all over Europe that is both unique and also interesting. If there is a huge shopping mall either as part of the complex or in the immediate vicinity of the main railway station of an urban area, that particular city has a lot to offer to its visitors. In the case of Poznań, it is no different either.
On the surface, the city on the River Warta is one of Poland’s largest urban conurbations, a hub of education, and an important business center. However, once you scratch the surface, the city becomes significantly more than another bustling metropolis. Poznań is home to a plethora of historic and cultural references.
Amid the many modern buildings and high-rise apartments, the city also showcases an eclectic mix of Baroque, Gothic and neoclassical architecture. There are many Budynek zabytkowy (listed buildings) and Pomnik historii (historic monuments) scattered around in the city, the ownership of which comes with certain obligations and restrictions.
On second thoughts, I believe a major shopping mall attached to the main station complex in…

Ever wondered how to draw a map of less common geographical areas? And color them based on some data? This pair of tutorials shows how to build this from scratch! First, you need to construct the border of your polygons — Part 1 is about this task. After that you need to create a map, and color those polygons according to some value of your interest. That will be shown in Part 2.
Part 1 of this tutorial is available here.
There are many tutorials on the internet for drawing maps in Python, even more sophisticated maps like heatmaps (where heat is basically the density of points in an area) or choropleth maps (where polygons are colored according to some arbitrary value). However, these tutorials are mainly done on states of the United States. View some great ones with plot.ly or an also otherwise superb one with folium. For the US, these packages have some convenience methods, but for the rest of the world, they’re of little use. Alternatively, they are based on some accidentally available json file like this one with Altair. Obviously, these are not general solutions to the problem of creating a map of some areas of your choice. I aim to give a general solution in these articles.
In this second part you will:
The code is also available on GitHub:
github.com
A GeoJson is actually a JSON file with some predetermined structure. The function above generates a GeoJSON file from a list of points by JSON dumping a dictionary formatted like a GeoJSON file. In these dictionaries, there are only 3 keys: lat, lon and name. Lat and lon stand for the coordinates, while name identifies the shape that the point belongs to. The order of these dictionaries in the list is also critical, you can read about this in the first part of this tutorial.
GeoDataFrames are a subclass of classic `pandas` DataFrames with a special column. This special column, geometry contains all the information that makes this DataFrame geo-aware. A GeoDataFrame object can be easily created from a GeoJSON file, you can add additional data to polygons easily, and just as easily convert it back to a GeoJSON file for visualization purposes.
In this snippet to the left centroids are added to each polygon. By this, we can add a nice marker to the centroid’s location depicting information about the polygon - in this case, the district. Just as easily as this, other data can be added using a plain pandas merge. Here, income tax per capita data is added to each polygon!
The creation of the map consists of 4 important steps:
Firstly, map creation is just as easy as it seems. You should provide a starting position, a starting zoom, and a tiles argument which is responsible for the basic design of your map. Be aware, that folium expects coordinates in latitude, longitude order!
Secondly, creating the choropleth is also easy, but it requires a neatly structured GeoJSON file. The parameters of the choropleth method speak for themselves, but you can refer to the documentation if something is not clear. This creates a layer where polygons are colored according to income tax per capita data — the more the greener, the less the yellower.
Thirdly, A FeatureGroup object is created. This object consist of Marker objects signalling each district’s name and the respective income tax per capita value to give the reader exact amounts apart from the color coding from choropleth. Lastly, LayerControl is added to the map in order to make it possible to show or hide layers, such as the choropleth or the FeatureGroup layer.
Finally, the map can be saved and the created .html file opened using your browser. You can find it on my github, in the outputs folder, but here is a snippet of it:
The main takeaway here is that in creating a beautiful choropleth map — just like in any data science project — data preparation takes around 90% of the effort. We got to know OpenStreetMap data structures and the Overpass API, and solved an interesting problem in Part 1. In Part 2, using GeoDataFrames made it easier to add information to our GeoJSON files and maps. It is also clear for me, that if you are creating maps in Python, folium is the way to go. As you can see, creating a map can be a one-liner, and creating choropleth maps or showing markers with html popups are really easy with folium.

Budapest is one of my favourite cities. Had an absolutely delightful day here. I would even chuck in a few of my other blog buzz words including “beautiful”, “lovely” and “ absolutely amazing”.
What better way to start the day. I had booked a tour which could have up to 8 guests and showed up at Central Market Hall. It was $145 which was a massive stretch but honestly why not. This is an incredible building inspired by the Eiffel Tower. The Hungarian government built four of these across the city in the 1870’s after all the open air markets got infested with cockroaches and snow for most of the year.
To my incredible fortune, the mysterious Mr & Mrs Chapelle from the US were both unwell and unable to attend. Private tour baby! With portions made for 4! I steeled myself for feeling like a spoiled baby.
I now also felt no concern in asking Orsha to photograph me as her happy customer.
Over the four hours and 12 spots I was reminded just why I love food tours. The history of a people is in their food. It explains their culture, customs and sends you directly into every family’s dinner table. Hungarian food also happens to perfectly correlate with my food preferences. We are talking:
I will now give you the rundown in several loose listicle paragraphs.
Market foods were first up.
This is their street food. A donut covered in garlic juice, sour cream and a mild cheddar. How could this not be delicious.
Next up we had the salami. I tried types called horse, curly haired pig, pork cheese (has all the different bits of the animal as different cubes) and Hungarian winter. Horse weirdly tasted how I thought it would. A wild earthy flavour that made me think of riding horses.
Some of the interesting things we saw in the market include a tonne of foie gras- Hungary is one the worlds largest producers- a tonne of fat and a delicacy of a whole chicken with an egg still in it.
A benefit of being on this tour alone was that Orsha had to field all my questions. She was likely unprepared for the grilling that arrived. Some facts for you:
The pickle tasting. That is right. The Hungarians are super into pickles. I was led down several alleys to the pickle basement. Cordoned off due to its offensive fragrance. She was concerned I might not like the smell. As an amateur pickler and somebody that has hosted an actual pickle party she couldn’t have worried more pointlessly.
Enter Marika, my hero. Handmaking pickles in the basement for over 50 years.
I got to choose my very own pickle selection and try them out. Easily the best I have ever had. My favourites were the kraut and the mini watermelons.
When I get back I am going to flat out not stop until I have prepared a pickle jar with a smile on it. Look forward to Christmas presents everybody as I think a month of unemployment should just about do it.
Also coincidentally I screenshotted this yesterday. I will just leave it here.
You know what else the Hungarians are into? Deliciousness. Lunch was this sausage and goulash place. Served with oodles of cabbage and horseradish. Divine. Followed by some iced coffee and cake that I ate before taking a picture of. It started with one forkful, then quickly snowballed until both slices were gobbled up.
I learnt a bit more historical stuff from Orsha too. Something I noticed as soon as I got off the train was how decrepit all the old buildings were. I asked Orsha what was up with that.
Basically what happened was that the Hungarians sided with Germany in both world wars. Hence they had massive damage in WW2 from gunfire and allied bombing.
After WW2 Hungary lost heaps of its land and was handed to the Soviets. After that they were largely communist. The soviets converted all the rich aristocratic houses into social housing and didn’t bother to repair them for 50 years. Hence the damage on these houses is genuinely from WW2.
There was also a large wall discovered from the original Budapest boundaries recently that we strolled past.
The strangest part of the whole thing was the final portion of the tour. Wine and cheese tasting with an actual sommelier in a huge cellar. I must say this was certainly not designed for one person, and certainly not a wine noob such as myself. I laughed and sipped and enjoyed desert wine with blue cheese as I nodded along to my very own personal wine lecture. A glorious combination.
My personal sommelier had not much to say to me after I requested to try some non alcoholic wines. I was having too much fun at this time and asked him all about what he thought about them. He said simply that it was a disgrace and “grape juice”. Oh Gregor. Keep pouring em.
I strolled home after this, quite drunk and somehow lost an earring. A perfect day really. Topped up off with such a heavy nap that I fell asleep on my sunglasses and hairbrush.
Loving it here. Really coming into its own this whole “Europe” thing. The further east we are getting the more I am loving it which is promising. The fast pace is also a nice change that is making time go very fast.
Today was just great. I very clearly need to do more food tours as it is just about my favourite experience a human can have. Tired but loved today.

I knew so much, when I was living in Budapest thirty years ago. And not only a lot more Hungarian than I know today.
I knew about the national poet and revolutionary Sándor Petöfi and about playwright and author Ferenc Molnár, after whom I name the fictitious Molnár Club in Birds of Passage. I still know a bit about them, and you may know of them, too.
In 1990 I was hearing a lot of talk in our Budapest social circle about the poet and playwright János Pilinszki, who had died about 10 years earlier and was still revered. He would definitely be on my fictional playwright Gábor’s mind.
And back then I knew about Gyula Krúdy, too; I’d even seen the acclaimed 1972 Zoltán Huszárik film Szindbád based on his work. I liked the idea that down-and-out Kalliopé – my favourite character in the novel – would think so longingly of the bone soup that figures in the film.
But I’d forgotten all about Pilinszki and Krúdy by the time I was rereading Birds of Passage this spring. Their names had become as foreign to me as they may be to you. I had to Google them to figure out why I’d included them in the novel, what they add to the characterization of Gábor and Kalliopé, and how I wanted to create a sense of the Budapest cultural milieu of the time.
I had no great hopes for Birds of Passage when I was writing it, and it had become too close to me for me to see it clearly when I finished it. I was thrilled when Karen Haughian of Signature Editions (then Nuage) wanted to publish it in 1993, and surprised when the review copies she sent out included one to the Times Literary Supplement.
And I did get lots of reviews, even as an unknown and unheralded writer.
The Globe and Mail was reviewing first novels in those days, CBC Radio discussed them on air, and publications like Books in Canada (now defunct) published thoughtful pieces unimaginable today — and paid the reviewers small but useful sums for doing so. I was the cover story in Hour magazine, also long-defunct, and I was interviewed by Shelagh Rogers.
Publishing a novel is nerve-wracking, and publicising a first novel is like having ball lightning in your kitchen. The work you have been obsessing over for years is out in the world – and being read by people you know and people you don’t know. They all have opinions of it, and some will tell you what they think, and who knows what they’ll say? Most will say little, if they say anything at all, and there’s no way of knowing if that’s even worse.
And then there’ll be the reviews – and far more people will read those than ever read your book.
An awful lot depends on reviews, which is the main reason for lamenting how few there now are.
I read the reviews of Birds of Passage with trepidation and astonishment.
The Globe’s was among the first:“Leith handles emotional crisis adroitly, without being clichéd. Her prose style is observant, quick and spare.” That was okay, pretty good, really.
Speaking on “The Arts Tonight” on CBC Radio, author Antanas Sileika praised the book in extravagant terms: “If you like Milan Kundera, if you like Vaclav Havel, you’re going to love this novel.”
Books in Canada described my novel as “remarkable” and published a long and thoughtful review article:
“Because Birds of Passage is a very sophisticated book, the title cuts many ways. The various birds that inhabit apartments, tunnels, mines, and nests enrich the story without intruding on it: suggestions of freedom and confinement, of beauty and fragility, rise naturally into the narrative. Moreover, because Gabor is a writer, Leith is able to comment playfully on her own creation. The novel’s ending seemed a touch contrived, but in a book of such varied delights this is a very small quibble. Leith has the gifts of a natural storyteller.”
The Times Literary Supplement took its time (its review appeared in 1994), but was well worth the wait:
“Hungary 1990 — with dissident lives redundant after the defeat of Communism, market prices making beggars of the population and foreign feminism knocking rudely at the door — is the setting for this excellent first novel. Birds of Passage explores the tenuous relationship between a Canadian couple and their Hungarian neighbours. Linda Leith is perceptive and never sentimental about the role Hungary plays in the lives of the Canadians, Alice and Daniel.
“Across the street from them, the playwright, Gabor, a romantic, who has mostly escaped reality by living the cloak-and-dagger existence of an underground political activist, cannot settle down to domestic responsibility; his apartment is full of sparrows trapped by the closed windows.
“Leith is good on the claustrophobic, old-fashioned feel of Central Europe, with its male heroes, its sacred places and works of art which artificially perpetuate a culture shut off from the international mainstream. Hungarian men in particular are so well adapted to the cage that when released they can barely survive. Alice, who has a strong character and appalling clothes sense, is impressive. Leith has that cool, precise way with the passions that makes one think of Alison Lurie.”
I had read only one book by Alison Lurie, whom The New York Times described as a “tart-voiced novelist of manners.” I didn’t see Birds of Passage as a novel of manners, but I was delighted with my allegedly “cool, precise way with the passions.”
TLS reviews were unsigned back then, and I did wish (and I still wish) I knew who had written this. Whoever it had clearly made the acquaintance of one or two Central European men.
I also wish I’d written to these and other reviewers to tell them how much I appreciated their comments on my book. I was a novice, and I didn’t know I could do that.
Getting a great review is one of the joys of becoming a writer – but then I got a letter from an outraged Hungarian émigrée who didn’t like my book at all.
This woman sang the praises of her homeland — and heartily wished that Birds of Passage had done the same. She deplored characters in my novel that she found unsavoury, including dear Kalliopé — and protested I’d sold Hungary short.
I didn’t agree then, and I don’t agree now, for a novel is not a travel brochure, and Alison Lurie is hardly the only novelist who can be tart-voiced. As Mavis Gallant once put it, “No writer calls a truce.”
But I am grateful to this woman for her letter. Hers was the response to Birds of Passage that did most to convince me I’d done my job as a novelist.

Hansje van Halem gave an amazing and very inspiring lecture during the 8th edition of Graphifest in the Design Terminal on 11 November 2014. After her talk she was so kind and answered my questions.
It’s always good to meet a person who is so passionate and enthusiastic when it comes to talking about his/her job. Dutch graphic and book designer Hansje van Halem, who has studied at Gerrit Rietveld Academy and has been working as a freelancer since graduation, is such a person. She used to hate typography because of the rules, but since she can work freely and do experiments she introduces their wonderful creations to the world regularly.
First of all, thank you for your lecture, it was really great. You have mentioned a lot of things regarding your career so I would be interested in the beginnings now. How and when did you first meet design? Did you actually want to be a designer when you were a child?One of my first memories thinking about my future can be dated back to when I was around 8 years. It was when we were taught how to draw perspective by using a ruler; we drew lines that looked endless. I remember making those drawings and thinking: I would like to have a job where I could use a ruler. I have realised now that I have a job for which I can use a ruler as it’s about measuring and calculation.
I also remember, at some point being ten or eleven, I wanted to be a theatre or movie director. I think that also makes sense because I should make a lot of decisions and to do a lot of processing.
It also has to be mentioned that both of my parents are artists so I grew up in an environment where my father had his studio next to our house and my mother had her atelier inside the house. So I was always surrounded by people making stuff and by material and equipment. I didn’t grow up like going to museums all the time but I did grow up in an environment where if I had an idea it was okay to cut and make something. I also remember begging my father: I had a huge stack of paper, and I would beg my father if he could put it under my mother’s sewing machine. It had to be sewed in the middle, and then I folded and filled the book. Additionally, as a kid, I loved the typewriter, I used it to create books.
You also said that you hated typography, however, the Netherlands is famous for type design and letters, so I’m wondering how it was possible.I started art school when I was 19 or 20; I went to a really formal one where they said: “These are the rules, this is how you should do it. When you do it differently, you do it wrong.” Moreover, I was a kid of an artist, my mother was also a teacher in a different art school, and I knew that art/design is always about pushing boundaries, looking for differences in things. At my school they didn’t teach this way of designing, it was all about rules, and in order to do a good job you had to live up to them.
Personally, I was too afraid, I knew if I made an S, then it had to be according to the rules. Then I changed school and went to this more Bauhaus type of working with teachers like Experimental Jetset, (Good)Will Holder, Jop van Bennekom and Gerard Unger. They were all so secure of their own work, that they easily gave space to their students. They would not give you an assignment like “create an S”, but said like “do a project with numbers”. I could just loose my imagination into looking at their systems. In addition to that, I could also find the space to experiment and to find out what’s right or wrong on my own without having a teacher saying this is right and this is wrong.
Do you think education is necessary, I mean does one have to go to school to be a good graphic designer?Of course, there are people who don’t have education, but I don’t know how anyone could afford not to spend four years full-time with so many professionals dedicated to this specific topic. You can learn so much, and you can have such a great time. If you do it on your own with a job on aside, I don’t think you get this level of knowledge and practice. I wouldn’t be a graphic designer without education, as I couldn’t have learnt so much in such a short time. Of course, you learn more after school than during school but that’s not the same.
You have also mentioned that you have your studio in your apartment. Do you think it’s a good idea to have a studio in one’s home?I forgot to tell… I worked from my student room in 2003–2004. It started to feel really weird when I started to have clients over. Sometimes they would leave late to get the work finished and there would be only a short period of time between the moment when the client left and the moment when I got undressed to go to sleep. Time to get some studio space!
After having a studio for a couple of years I was fed up and moved my work space back into my (now bigger) house in 2009. That was a very productive period of two years. I took in an intern and started a gallery space in my living room showcase cabinet. But when I was sitting on the edge of my bed having dinner, I realised I needed my house back. Again, I started looking for a studio in 2011, and now I have a really nice one about 15 minutes away from my house. It’s good to have a start and a finish every day even if the day takes very long. It’s also nice that when I come home there isn’t a room full of sketches.
Do you work alone or sometimes within a group maybe?I work alone. Sometimes I need help but this is always on different levels. If I’m busy and some correction rounds need to be done regarding a book I know somebody who is more precise than I am so I just hire her. But I do everything alone basically. One of my wishes for my next life is to be a designer duo because it’s kind of lonely sometimes.
How many projects do you usually work on at the same time? I assume creating a book it’s a great amount of work.Oh, yes. It can be zero projects so I make my own stuff but it can be 5 or 7 projects at the same time. Of course, they don’t have the deadline all at once because it would be impossible to complete all the tasks, so it has to be one project starting, one waiting for reply, etc. I think I do my best when I have multiple things do to because otherwise I would start to make a big deal out of making decisions.
I’m just curious, do you use a calendar or do you know all the deadlines by heart?I keep many of them in my head, I usually know that I have a deadline next week.
How many projects are you working on right now?I am in some kind of troubles this week as I’m not working here. I’m getting a solo exhibition in Eindhoven; I’m making a spin-off of my publication, it will be 48 pages instead of 484 and it will be cheaper as well.
Yesterday I was in a supermarket in Budapest, and the printer called me and said: “We are running out of time. I’m afraid we are not gonna make it.” I was like “I’m in Budapest, I cannot do anything”. So it was a bit stressful. I was invited to design a fence for a company in Holland, which is a different thing, it’s working with material. I’m doing a poster design for a gallery located in Northern Holland. In fact, I just finished it last week, but I know there is a next one so I’ve started experimenting. This is something I do for free and I really enjoy. They always give me nice reviews. Of course, in between I make a diploma for students, and I’m working on logos for some individuals. So there are lot of stuff going on…
You work a lot. Can you stop working at some point? I’m asking because you’ve also said during your lecture that you do repetitious work in your free time.Yes, but I love watching TV as well. For the first 5 years I was working non-stop, later I realised there’ll always be work so it’s okay to take a break, it’s very normal to have weekends. There was a short period during the crisis when I was getting less money so I could not hire people and I was working during weekends, but I’m back on track now.
And finally, how do you like Budapest?For me it’s a cultural shock. I was just getting on the plane as it was taking a train to another city in Holland but getting out of the plane I had to realise this is not Holland. I didn’t really have time to think about being here, though. Today I was walking around, and first you go to the tourist layer and looking all the windows, but then I was taken to the House of Terror, which, of course, changes perspectives. You get the contrast between all the beautiful, decorated ceilings you could see in the buildings and this horrible history… And you meet nice people as well. I’ve been here for 30 hours maybe so I cannot say so much but it’s very intriguing.
You should come back later on!I’m going to treat my mother on a weeklong holiday in Budapest. I’m just thinking of stuff what we should do.
By the way, do you know anything about Hungarian graphic design?Only what I’ve seen on Graphifest, and, of course, I’be been looking around in the city as for graphic design it’s very important to get a platform, a space to show design. I’m just wondering what the operation spaces of Hungarian designers are.
They usually open a studio…Yes, but I mean in the street. I’ve seen posters but I don’t think those are designed by those people. Maybe different types of agencies…
There is an exhibition called ARC that has a theme every year, for instance.Yes, but for me exhibitions are designs for designers, however, designers should also meet clients who will hire them. Right now my problem is who will hire me, I might be invited to more exhibitions than for work. It’s lovely that people appreciate what you are doing and want to hang and show your work to other people but you need to make a living as well.
Do you think it should be offline, I’m just wondering, because you can be hired based on your portfolio on Behance/website, for example?I think your work should be everywhere. I’m on Cargo Collective because it has a gallery system so every time I do something I can put them in the front row. I get clients from there, and also from Instagram.
I don’t know how people did it before because when I graduated there was no Facebook or Tumblr, people did have websites but I have no idea how they did it. There were a lot of requests for portfolio books, though. There was always a book being published, and an art director called you that he/she wanted you in that book. Exposure is very important. I also have friends and colleagues who have maximum exposures but no paid assignments. So they get invited to Japan, for example, but nobody calling them saying: “Hello, we have some money, can you create something for us?” It would be nice to be found by an agent or something. I can see on Instagram that an agency is following me and I’m thinking: Oh, interesting, maybe they want me.

Reading scripts. Absolutely critical to learn the craft of screenwriting. The focus of this weekly series is a deep structural and thematic analysis of each script we read. Our daily schedule:
Monday: Scene-By-Scene BreakdownTuesday: Major Plot PointsWednesday: SequencesThursday: Psychological JourneyFriday: Takeaways
Today: Major Plot Points.
In every scene, something happens. A plot point is a scene or group of scenes in which something major happens, an event that impacts the narrative causing it to turn in a new direction.
A relevant anecdote. Years ago, I was on the phone with a writer discussing a script project. My son Will, who was about four years old at the time, must have been listening to me talking about “plot points” during the conversation because after I hung up, he asked, “Daddy, what’s a plop point?”
That’s in effect what a plot point is. It’s an event that ‘plops’ into the narrative and changes its course. So when you think Plot Point, think Plop Point!
The value of this exercise:
* To identify the backbone of the story structure.
* To examine each major plot point and see how it is effective as an individual event.
* To analyze the major plot points in aggregate to determine why they work together as the central plot.
This week: The Grand Budapest Hotel. You may download the script — free and legal — here: The Grand Budapest Hotel.
Screenplay by Wes Anderson, story by Wes Anderson & Hugo Guinness, inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig
IMDb plot summary: The adventures of Gustave H, a legendary concierge at a famous hotel from the fictional Republic of Zubrowka between the first and second World Wars, and Zero Moustafa, the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend.
Writing Exercise: Go through the scene-by-scene breakdown of The Grand Budapest Hotel and identify the major plot points. Post your thoughts in comments and we’ll see if we can come up with a consensus.
For Part 1, to read the Scene-By-Scene Breakdown created by Rob Hoskins, go here.
Tomorrow we consider the script’s structure in terms of its sequences.
If you’d like a PDF of The Grand Budapest Hotel, script scene-by-scene breakdown, go here.
Major kudos to Rob Hoskins for doing this week’s breakdown.
Tomorrow: We focus on the sequences in the script.
This series started here and we have 26 volunteers to do scene-by-scene breakdowns of contemporary movie scripts. The scripts we have already analyzed are in italics.

For new volunteers and those who have already volunteered, but not sent me a breakdown yet, please do so as soon as possible. Thanks!
Circling back to where we started, reading scripts is hugely important. Analyzing them even more so. If you want to work in Hollywood as a writer, you need to develop your critical analytical skills. This is one way to do that.
So seize this opportunity and join in the conversation!
I hope to see you in comments about this week’s script: The Grand Budapest Hotel.Comment Archive

Budapest is Hungary’s capital and largest city. It is by far the most visited city in the country, with millions of tourists landing every year. It also happens to be one of my most favorite cities. That being said, I am a traveler and not a tourist.
As such, every time I plan to travel, the idea is to go beyond the usual. In the case of Hungary, it is no different. Every occasion I venture out to this beautiful European country, I behave very unlike me. I make at least a couple of impromptu decisions during every vacation, and this attitude has helped me explore a lot of the country. This trip was no different.
For starters, on this occasion, I had not landed in Budapest and planned further. Instead, I was on my way to the hitherto unexplored western part of Hungary, having flown in to neighboring Austria. While I landed at Vienna, it was not going to be my base for the next few days. On the contrary, I had towards Sopron.
In the eight days that followed, I ended up exploring Sopron, Szombathely, Kőszeg and the surrounding countryside in the Győr-Moson-Sopron County and the Vas County. All the cities I ended up visiting also have a German name. So it is Ödenburg for Sopron…

I’m well aware that we don’t all rewatch films at the same time. We are all subject to individual whims that diverge and intersect largely at random. That said, I do think that in the near future many of us will be rewatching Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel.
This prediction is based on several factors: the impending release of Anderson’s new film The Phoenician Scheme, a renewed (or perhaps wholly original) fondness for Ralph Fiennes following his performance in Conclave, and the general critical consensus that The Grand Budapest Hotel represents the culmination of Anderson’s artistic vision. Essentially, if we’re due for a Wes Anderson rewatch, this will be the film a good 75–80% of participants will pick.
It’s my belief that when people do return to it, they’ll find the same thing I found during my recent rewatch. It’s better now than it was the first time. Why? Because time is a flat circle and our moral dilemmas have a habit of resurfacing in new disguises.
Viewers noted from the film’s release that one of its key themes was the rise of fascism. What I think we lacked in 2014 was an understanding of fascism as a recurring threat rather than one that was just as much an article of the past as the Grand Budapest itself. Sure, we could link the film’s commentary on the treatment of immigrants to ongoing crises in the world, but we didn’t see fascist militaries boarding trains and demanding visas. We saw… logistical challenges.
This political inattentiveness at the time of the film’s release contributed to a chronic misinterpretation of the two protagonists. Primarily, critics were prone to forgetting there were, in fact, two protagonists.
Readers may have noticed my use of the pronoun “we” up to this point when making my points. The “we” I am referring to are fellow white beneficiaries of the imperial core. To those reading who do not fit into that category, my apologies, but you’ll see the utility in a moment.
Our greatest failing when initially addressing The Grand Budapest Hotel at the time of its release, was to center our attentions almost entirely on M. Gustave for analysis. He is by all means a fascinating character with many aspects to pick apart and discuss; however, his function in the narrative is to serve as a catalyst and foil for our true central character, Zero.
The Grand Budapest Hotel is presented in layers, a trick Anderson has become quite fond of if his more recent film Asteroid City is any indication. The film opens on a young girl reading a book next to the grave of the book’s author, who awaits us in the next layer to detail a story from his youth, where in the next layer he meets with the aging proprietor of a hotel far past its prime situated in the fictional alpine nation of Zubrowka, and in the final layer where most of the film takes place, the proprietor recounts his time as a lobby boy at the hotel. By all accounts, the narrator and arbiter of style for most of the film is Zero (or at least the image of Zero his older self conveys to the author).
Like many of Anderson’s films, this one concerns itself with nostalgia for bygone eras. This nostalgia textures the memory of previous times to such a degree that they become more of a fantastical setting than a true reflection of the past, putting a pair of rose-tinted glasses on for the audience. Against the backdrop of a pastel 1930s Europe, we’re confronted with a group of characters who deliberately clash with it. While the staff of The Grand Budapest and the other members of the Society of Crossed Keys all stand out with vivid color, they are contrasted by the setting’s rising fascist movement dressed entirely in monochrome.
A common criticism I’ve found of Anderson’s work is that he prioritizes style over substance, that his chief concern is the aesthetic coherence of an auteur rather than the merit of his narratives. While in some cases this may be fair, what my rewatch of The Grand Budapest Hotel illustrated for me is that to measure style against substance is to create a false dichotomy. That is because, in this film style elucidates substance, substance that in 2014 we were perhaps less primed to recognize.
The rosiness of The Grand Budapest’s past and the whimsical absurdity of its inhabitants are the product of Zero’s recollection, because at this point in his life the hotel may as well be a fairyland compared to what came before. We learn later in the film, following a frustrated outburst from Gustave that gives way to a host of xenophobic insults, that Zero came to Zubrowka from an unnamed Arab country going through a state of political turmoil. He fled after witnessing the execution of his entire family and the lingering threat from the encroaching fascist army will mean death for him, should they choose to deport him.
While most reviews of the film at its release were positive, the few notable criticisms were leveled against the plot, some saying it felt nonsensical and unconnected to any broader theme. And when you view the film with Gustave as its true protagonist, the criticism makes sense. However, when you consider the film from Zero’s perspective, there’s an obvious logic as to why he would focus on patently silly events and madcap drama. To him, these are the good times. Times when he had his mentor and wife with him, when the fascists were a distant presence that only occasionally menaced him, and he had a home that filled him with a sense of purpose. This is the story he wishes to tell.
In the narrative layer where he speaks with the author, the now dilapidated Grand Budapest is the last vestige of that former life Zero still possesses. He explains that he maintains it not in memory of Gustave, who embodied the hotel’s spirit and ultimately bequeathed it to him, but in memory of his wife Agatha. This was the place they were happy together, however short that time may have been. The utility of memory is such that by sharing it we allow ourselves to be better understood.
We made the mistake of assuming fascism was included in the movie to emphasize that theme of memory, that is was a thing of the past that poked a hole in an otherwise happy period, but we also presumed that the only associations with it that mattered are our own. It is easier for us to relate to Gustave, because like him, our confrontations with fascist oppression are taken on by choice. Even with the added context that some of us, like Gustave, are queer and have that as a potential target on our backs, our existences are not constantly hounded by fascist dogma in the same way those of immigrants and refugees are.
While Zero’s growth over the course of the film is defined by him establishing himself as an integral part of the Grand Budapest’s community, Gustave’s arc centers his developing awareness of his own privilege and the value of his relationships with others. He comes to understand that there are ways to relate to others beyond providing a service.
The scene that I find most striking ten years later is a scene shot entirely in monochrome. It is an echo of an earlier scene and an escalation of the film’s color language. The fascist army boards the train and enters the train car occupied by Gustave, Zero, and Zero’s wife Agatha. They request the travelers’ papers, though this time with a heavier threat hanging over their heads should they produce the wrong kind of papers. Zero pulls out a wrinkled and ripped work visa, which Gustave confirms the legitimacy of and even produces a card from a commander in the fascist army indicating they should be allowed to pass. The fascist army members do not accept this. And Gustave, as the author is told by an older Zero, gave his life trying to ensure Zero’s safe passage. What precisely happened to Zero and Agatha in the two years between Gustave’s death and the death of Agatha and her child is left ambiguous, but one can presume they were not happy times.
It is easy for things to become commonplace which would have been unthinkable just a few years prior. We now live in a version of the US confident in its power to harass, detain, and deport immigrants on a whim. We have people boarding our trains and asking for our documents at this very moment. What The Grand Budapest Hotel wants us to realize is that we have a duty to the person sitting next to us. It can be easy to allow injustices to pass us by due to relative distance, to cling to a veneer of civility and not make a fuss.
Perhaps the most insidious misinterpretation of the film is that Gustave is a good man because of his civility, that his politeness brings him karmic rewards because he does not discriminate in who he is polite to. The aforementioned scene refutes this assertion, bookmarked in black and white so the audience takes care to remember. Gustave was a good man because he knew when to take action, and he gained that knowledge through his friendship with Zero. If his strength is his civility, then true civility must include a refusal to sit by and allow harm to come to the people around you.
The Grand Budapest Hotel is a better film now in 2025 than it was at release, because present political circumstances make it far more difficult for us to miss the point. Zero was always the heart of the story, his attachment to the hotel always in relation to how it provided a home for him rather than a vocation. It is only now that we begin to develop the consciousness to understand these things outside of our own privileged experience. It is no longer possible to ignore.
We feel the weight of the world of memory Anderson presents more keenly now because we have lost the benefit of distance from the time it represents.

They say there are two types of people in Budapest, those who live in Buda and those who want to live in Buda.
Well, after my first trip to this stunning city with my high school best friend, Kat, I can see why. Buda, with its rolling hills and picturesque skyline, is undeniably the prettier side of the Danube, but I quickly fell for both Buda and Pest.
There’s a certain magic to the way the two sides blend, separated by the wide, winding river but bound together by history and charm.
From the moment we arrived, we were swept up in Budapest’s grandeur. The architecture alone felt like it was trying to impress us. It succeeded. Every street corner seemed to shout, “Look at me! I’m outrageously elegant!” with good reason.
The city is a feast for the eyes, with its majestic buildings, intricate monuments, and statues that could rival those in any European capital.

🏩✨A number of years ago, upon writing this review, we had decided to spend the tenth day of August in the spa town of Nebelsbad below the Alpine Sudetenwaltz — and had taken up rooms in the Grand Budapest — a picturesque, elaborate, and a still widely-celebrated establishment. 🗓📝🏔We expect some of you will know it. 🌸🎟
After boarding the LFC Express, we have finally arrived at our destination: The Grand Budapest Hotel, with the Buda-best service, Mr. Gustave- approved! Read our review as we reminisce on this classic cinematic masterpiece!

Wes Anderson’s ‘The Grand Budapest Hotel’ is well positioned to win some Oscars on Sunday. It received nine Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Picture. The film’s editing has received widespread praise and Editor Barney Pilling is nominated in that category (his first Oscar nomination). Pilling’s work on ‘Budapest’ also recently won him an ACE Eddie Award for Best Edited Feature, Comedy/Musical. Pilling’s past projects include ‘An Education,’ ‘Never Let Me Go,’ and ‘One Day.’ He’s currently working on ‘Suffragette’ starring Meryl Streep and Helena Bonham Carter.
Here’s our Q&A on ‘The Grand Budapest Hotel’:
What inspired you to become an editor?
I’ve always loved watching films throughout my life and I’ve always had a creative drive…but I’d have to say that the sci-fi and war films of my childhood really fired my imagination in a way that little else did and probably set the foundation for a life of make-believe. ‘Star Wars,’ Spielberg, ‘Bladerunner,’ ‘2001 A Space Odyssey,’ ‘Alien,’ ‘Guns of Navarone,’ ‘Where Eagles Dare,’ ‘Bridge on the River Kwai’ and so on.
What’s it like to work on a Wes Anderson film?
It’s incredibly hard work and truly exhilarating, all at the same time! It’s also a privilege for me to work with so many outstanding craftspeople and performers.
What were the biggest challenges with editing the film?
Probably pulling in so many elements from so many different sources, studios and countries for the action pieces. We had green screen main unit, miniature model and landscape builds in Berlin, stop motion puppetry happening in London, and Look FX tinkering away in LA — so pulling all this into focus with the right rhythm was a long and tough process. Also technically really demanding of the editorial team and the Avid Software — many, many video layers!
Both you and your wife are in the business. Do you discuss work at home?
Yes! Lots. It’s hard not too. You have to be very passionate about what you are doing to succeed in the TV and Film industry, so it’s difficult to switch it off at home. Also, we end up being first audiences of our respective projects — bouncing things off each other — it’s nice.
Could you see yourself working with Wes Anderson again?
I hope so! I’m incredibly proud of the work we all did on that ‘Grand Budapest Hotel’ and have become close friends with many of my fellow craftspeople. These are feelings and relationships that of course anyone would want to repeat or perpetuate.

I have been pretty inactive on social media in the past few weeks because my phone was stolen while I was traveling in Budapest, Hungary. Losing your phone is very inconvenient in this day and age, when so much activity and business has moved to mobile platforms. Not having Google maps in my palm made navigation a bit more cumbersome, and many of my plane tickets and travel information were on my phone. I also couldn’t look up different restaurants to go and compare the reviews. Worst of all, I was cut off from the rest of the world as I couldn’t access my emails, texts, phone calls, social media, etc.
My first impression of Budapest was very positive. I liked how traditional Budapest is compared to other big cities in Europe, and the Hungarian culture is alive and thriving in this city. Many of the restaurants were over a hundred years old, serving traditional Hungarian cuisine the same way they had for centuries. There was a wide variety of meats, including goose, venison (deer meat), wild boar, duck, rabbit, etc., which I really appreciated because those types of meats are relatively rare in America and Western Europe, where people usually just eat chicken, beef, or pork for their protein. Moreover, prices in general were a lot lower in Budapest, although the exchange rate was pretty confusing because 1 US dollar is almost 300 Hungarian Forints (289.22 as of July 14, 2019). I…

October has always been my favorite month, filled with happiness, and fun, and began of the festival. But this October, we planned to do something different, So We decided to take our vacation to Budapest. We did not take a single vacation break this year which made us do something different, to feel like we did something this year apart from work or regular life.
Budapest the capital city of Hungary, is a town rich with history, beautiful breathtaking architecture, and unforgettable experiences.
But this trip was different from any other trip we had before because we ticked off one of the most thrilling items on our bucket list: skydiving.
I’ve always been drawn to the idea of flying, but nothing could prepare me for the rush of actually leaping from a plane at 10,000 feet. The sensation was beyond words. Budapest, with its stunning landscapes, became the perfect backdrop for…

We were awakened in the middle of the night on our European River Cruise by a loud noise, a shaking of the boat from left to right and back to left again, and the closet light flashing on and off as the door spontaneously opened and banged shut.
“What was that?” I asked my husband as I grabbed his arm. He looked out our glassed-in French Balcony. “We’re in a lock,” he said. “The boat must have hit the side of it.”
Within minutes, we were back to sleep. We had our safety drill early in the trip and no sirens went off nor was any announcement made — whatever it was, lock or no lock, we were safe.
When we planned our vacation traversing Europe on three iconic rivers — the Danube, Rhine, and Main — we had no idea we’d pass through so many locks.

Wes Anderson’s “The Grand Budapest Hotel” is colorful, quirky and almost surreal.
Behind Anderson’s detailed world is Marquette alumnus Adam Stockhausen, Comm ‘95.
Director Wes Anderson and Stockhausen looked at old hotels and other eastern European buildings to create the invented country of Zubrowka.
“The Grand Budapest Hotel” received nine Oscar nominations and won four of them.
Stockhausen took home his first Oscar for production design. He shares this award with set designer Anna Pinnock.

He graduated from Marquette in 1995 with a degree in theater.
“He has that ability to wrap his mind around stuff and to get so engrossed in things that it really turns out some wonderful stuff,” Marquette Theatre Artistic director Debra Krajec told Fox6 News.
Stockhausen is the first Marquette graduate to win an Academy Award since Dom Ameche won for Best Supporting Actor in 1986.
Stochkausen was previously nominated for his work in the 2012 film “12 Years a Slave.” He has already worked on two films since “The Grand Budapest Hotel.”

The city smelled of days’ worn clothes. Streets are littered with piss stains, cigarette butts and small piles of dog shit. Budapest features a rich history, the majesty of time immemorial is written into ornate buildings riddled with bullet holes, and in somber pockmarked faces of passerbys. Ambulances in a foreign language squeal in the distance, like a whining dog. Trams charge up and murmur in electric tongues. Dark-haired people with thin lips and absent eyes mix into the landscape.
I get the sense of an underlying hardship, that people are struggling (later confirmed by talking with locals). Maybe it’s winter malady, absent of snow and joy. The only people laughing loudly are the tourists, who are everywhere; Flaunting their unburdened spirit, unbridled by work or school or obligations (here on holiday for cheap thrills). To walk down the sidewalk is to island hop between unrecognizable dialects. You know a tourist by: Loud chittering dispersed amid large flocks with cocked heads; raised eyes and abrupt stops to review digital maps; movement that is too fast or slow for the pace of the street.
I’m not sure what I was looking for in my trip, and I wouldn’t say that I’ve “learned about myself” or “grown” per se. I would like to continue streaking away from a traditional career in America; I want to let go of the rope on the bunny slope. I don’t desire being different as a matter of course, but simply following others is not the way towards individuation.
I do seek: Authenticity. As Dōgen, a Japanese Buddhist priest, writer, poet, philosopher, and founder of the Sōtō school of Zen in Japan, said, “We study the self to forget the self. When you forget the self, you can become one with the ten thousand things.” And as the Buddah proclaimed, “kill the Buddah.” Or, your ultimate goal is to make your own way. Guides, inspiration, models offer signposts, but the landscape is vast and inherently unique for each person; I intend to get off the trail, even if I need to come back and follow the blazes from time to time.
Towards the end of his life, Carl Jung stated that our greatest adventure today is in the exploration of our unconscious. Everything else is a distraction; to know ourselves is more important, meaningful, and challenging than say, colonizing Mars — while I appreciate the pursuit it seems more like an act of running away from the real meaning here on Earth (and from within ourselves).
In the Western world, we live in a culture of (inter-)connection in the form of: sociability and social networks; emails and Twitter streams; a prizing of extraversion; boredom and distraction. And yet loneliness is both ubiquitous and a condemnation. Jung would classify this as the Shadow of our collective Ego, because consciousness exists for individuals and societies, and we are very good at denying ourselves and each other at scale. To deny your Self is to empower the Shadow, which is the root for maladies of the human personality.
Tidying things up: In a world with excess information most of us are sponges, super-saturated with no spare volume for our own understanding… what would happen if we were all suddenly wrung dry?
AARON GERRY tries not to take himself too seriously, despite what the content may suggest. He enjoys pen and paper, perambulating, and donuts. Many donuts. Oh and writing. Speaking of which, his work can be found in journals and publications such as Chronogram, Lit Up, P.S. I Love You, The Creative Cafe, The Junction, and others. If you like this piece please do 👏clap👏 along!

Wes Anderson’s “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” released in 2014, is a cinematic masterpiece that defies categorization. With its distinctive visual style, quirky characters, and intricate narrative structure, the film takes audiences on a whimsical journey through a world that is both charmingly surreal and emotionally resonant. As a testament to Anderson’s unique directorial vision, “The Grand Budapest Hotel” has left an indelible mark on the world of cinema.
A Visual Delight
From the moment the film begins, viewers are enveloped in a visually enchanting universe that could only have sprung from the mind of Wes Anderson. The movie’s meticulously crafted set designs, intricate color palettes, and meticulously arranged compositions create a mesmerizing experience. The Grand Budapest Hotel itself, with its pink façade and ornate interiors, serves as both a central character and a metaphor for the film’s whimsical allure.
Anderson’s keen attention to detail extends beyond the set design. The use of miniatures and practical effects adds a layer of tangible magic to the story, transporting the audience to a realm that feels both nostalgic and otherworldly. Each frame is a work of art, and the film’s distinctive visual style is as much a character as any of the actors.
An Ensemble of Eccentric Characters
At the heart of “The Grand Budapest Hotel” is an ensemble cast that brings the film’s eccentric characters to life with remarkable depth and charisma. The inimitable Ralph Fiennes leads the pack as the charismatic and witty concierge, Monsieur Gustave H. His magnetic performance adds a layer of charm and complexity to the character, making him simultaneously hilarious and heartwarming.
The supporting cast is equally impressive, with memorable performances from Saoirse Ronan, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Tilda Swinton, Jeff Goldblum, and many others. Each character, no matter how minor, contributes to the film’s rich tapestry, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.
A Narrative Maze
What sets “The Grand Budapest Hotel” apart is its intricate narrative structure. The film unfolds as a story within a story within a story, skillfully weaving together different timelines and perspectives. This layered approach not only keeps the audience engaged but also deepens the emotional resonance of the film.
The narrative structure is further enhanced by the film’s playful tone and dark humor. Anderson effortlessly transitions between moments of slapstick comedy and poignant introspection, creating a balance that keeps the audience emotionally invested while never taking itself too seriously.
Themes of Nostalgia and Loss
Beneath the film’s whimsy and humor lies a profound exploration of themes such as nostalgia, loss, and the passage of time. Through the character of Zero Moustafa (played by F. Murray Abraham and Tony Revolori), the audience witnesses the changing landscape of Europe and the hotel’s decline from its glamorous heyday. This melancholic undercurrent adds depth to the film, reminding us that even the most fantastical worlds are not immune to the effects of time.
Conclusion
“The Grand Budapest Hotel” is a cinematic gem that continues to captivate audiences with its unique blend of visual artistry, quirky characters, and intricate storytelling. Wes Anderson’s directorial vision shines through in every frame, creating a world that feels simultaneously nostalgic and fresh. The film’s ability to evoke laughter, wonder, and introspection is a testament to its enduring appeal. As we revisit the charming corridors of the Grand Budapest Hotel, we are reminded that, in the world of cinema, true magic knows no bounds.

A book that made me book a flight to Budapest. I guess it was one of the best decisions. Right now, crying here in “Vinikli” while enjoying Hungarian wine, still feeling so happy that I am here. Thank you Magda Szabó.
Oh, my heart. This book is why I’m sitting here in Budapest, crying my eyes out as I read the final pages. What a story… my heart is shattered into pieces. My dear Etelka. My dear Iza.
My journey with Hungarian literature began with Sándor Márai’s Portraits of a Marriage, which remains one of my favorite books. But this one, written by the talented Magda Szabó, is just as incredible. Reading the final pages in the very place where it all unfolded is truly a magical experience.
In Etelka, I saw so much of my own mother, and in the things Iza did thinking she was helping her mother, but slowly, unintentionally causing her to wither like a flower, I unfortunately found myself in her.
After my family lost their first child, perhaps because I am the only child my family had later in life, I empathized with the book deeply — I’m not sure — but it touched me profoundly. I felt an incredible sense of regret for every time I was unsympathetic toward my mother. At the same time, just like Etelka, Iza’s life was also changed, and I can truly relate to the turmoil and confusion she went…

Budapest is the capital and this was my second time here. This time the stay was in Hotel Danubius Helia at the Karpat Utca, on the banks of river Danubius. You get a view of Margaret island from the hotel rooms. I visited the island on the Day 1 evening, people usually go there for jogging, having alcohol at the restaurant, watching the ruins. There is also a presedved bio diversity, a few animals kept in there covered from all sides.
I took a walking tour on the second day and they take you through: the Parliament, American Embassy, Heroes square, Ruin Bars, the Jewish synagogue
Its a very small country in the Central Europe, part of which also meets the Adriatic Sea in the south. Almost any part can be reached in a couple of hours from the capital: Ljubljana. If compared, the country must be smaller than Indian state Madhya Pradesh.
Unlike rest of the European countries, the capital doesn’t have Tram trains and Subways as public transport. You can only use the local buses. In fact if you’re a tourist, every tourist spot can be covered by walk. Its all within a square kilometer from the main bus station. Preseren Square, Ljubljana castle, Dragon Bridge, National & University Library, Restaurants, Market are the only places that can be visited or are a must visit. You won’t find Starbucks, Subway, KFC et cetera here in the capital. Luckily, we have McD, Pizza Hut, at least for the Vegetarians.
25 minutes of walk to the castle, mostly climbing, you get a very beautiful view of the city from the top. There are multiple entries and exits at the bottom where you can start your climbing. You can also take a Funicular railway for a return ticket of 6 Euros, to avoid walking. I preferred walking because thats what I’ve been doing since last 6 days perhaps to save a few Euros for the remaining tour. I’ve started liking to walk (a lot) now a days. You’ll see a bunch of private restaurants, pretty costly too, on the top part of the castle. This part, privatization at the world heritage sites, I really hate it.
Bled is a beautiful town 55 kimoleters away from the capital. Arriva is the transport company here which takes you there with a good frequency of buses, for every half an hour, charging 13 Euros for return. I had planned for only 1 day for Bled unknowing of its charm. One can spend like a week here if you plan to see it thoroughly. There’s a lake in the middle of the town with a small island which has a church. People usually take local ferries to reach there, the charge is 15 Euros for return. Its a wooden boat and the person ferrying us has to row using the oars in both hands, sounds like bit of a stamina work, right? To add to that, there were around 16 people on the boat.
Vintgar Klamm is a place from where you can start your walk through gorge, to the waterfall alongside the picturesque Radovna river. 2 Euros for a return ticket by bus from Bled and about 30 minutes to reach.
Its a beautiful walk with cold breezes and lushy green forest. You can also go near the water, drink it, sit there for some time unless you are making any risky move.
For solo travellers or not tourists, who do not want to spend a lot on stay, I would suggest booking Turn Hostel in Mala Ulica near the main bus station which is 5 minutes walking distance. They charge around 25 Euros per night plus 3 Euros environment tax. Also all tourist places in Ljubljana are at a walking distance.
After the beautiful trip of Slovenia, I then took a bus from the main bus station of Ljubljana to Marburg where I’ll be meeting my brother in law. It was a 17 hours of journey by Bus, I had booked a Flixbus through their app, it costed me 53 Euros. The bus was scheduled at 21:05.
The bus was a double decker Flixbus and it was running late by an hour as it had started from Zagreb. To my surprise, Buses in Europe run late too. I hadn’t booked a specific seat number, so boarded and searched for the best available seat for me on the upper half. It doesn’t matter to be seated in last seats in European countries as the roads and speed breakers are smooth enough. More importantly, buses are comparatively comfortable too. I got a window seat exactly above the rear tyre set. It was a semi sleeper and the journey was for the entire night. Phew!!
It reached on time to the Frankfurt bus station at around 9:00 am and I had a connecting bus at 11:00 am to Marburg. I walked in to a nearby hotel to enquire for using the washroom. 1 Euro was the charge. I quickly refreshed myself, enquired for the coffee at the reception but unfortunately they didn’t serve only coffee, I needed to take the entire buffet which I was not in the mood to. I decoded to take a walk around the bus station, it was a big place, with many shops, hotels, tram stations et cetera. I could even see an Indian restaurant across the road, but it would only open after I take my bus to Marburg.
“I don’t know where I’m going but I’m on my way”
Trip Route:
Mumbai — Vienna — Budapest — Ljubljana — Bled — Ljubljana— Marburg — Munich — Vienna — Mumbai

UPDATE: This is a fairly old article, since the 2015 instagram update various aspect ratios are allowed to upload, from 1.91:1 to 1:1 hooray for cinematographers and directors like Reed Morano or Emmanuel Lubezki. But that doesn’t mean this article is of no use, all the contrary, the quick lessons within still apply if you want to give that somewhat classic look to your instagram account, much better if you like the squared ratio photos, like many photographers of the minimalist style wave do.
Those who saw “The Grand Budapest Hotel” can agree with me that it was marvelous in many aspects: Oscar worthy direction, scenarios, music and many others. But for now, i’m writing about his cinematography/ photography direction by the hand of Robert D. Yeoman and how he and the movie can make you a better instagrammer.
When I just finished watching it for the first time, at the moment the credits were rolling I realized that the movie itself is, in a way, an awesome and inspiring example of Instagram photography.
The frames were composed with such taste and detail that the first thing I say to my friends about the movie is that “It’s visually incredible”; and perhaps, some part of that beauty it’s because of the unusual (almost squared) 1.37:1 aspect ratio used on most of the length of the film.
That unusual look gave the movie that 30's vintage film look that I found absolutely beautiful and, in fact, it’s very Instagram-like.
Note that Instagram uses a 1:1 Squared aspect ratio, not 1.37:1, but between 1.37:1 and 1:1 there isn’t a lot difference.
The following are some examples of the key aspects I was able to absorb from the movie.
The Grand Budapest Hotel teaches us that keeping in mind the frame when composing is the key, every line, every element and just about everything is in the tone and fits perfectly on his aspect ratio. (look at the courtains in the example or the columns in the first picture)
One of the primary reasons that most people post bad photos on Instagram is that they not compose their photos thinking “squared”, they aren’t thinking in 1:1 ratio, some people just take the pictures, as usual, in the aspect ratio the camera app is set (usually 2:3 or 16:9), forgetting the composition, and later they crop the photo in Instagram, well, that’s a mistake. Use an app like VSCO cam, the square guide feature within the app is meant for Instagram users, it helps a lot.
“Always think 1:1”
It’s all about giving your subject his space, the movie does this perfectly, sometimes with flat backgrounds, brighter backgrounds and not making the subject to absorb the entire frame.
Make it simple
Sometimes there will be a trashcan or a chair that will come out on your way, disbalancing your shot, and the best way to treat this is simply moving them away to have a better and cleaner composition. Or you can incorporate them to become a part of your shot, as I explain in the next point.
One thing I found curious, specially in this shot, is the fact that all the elements in the movie are in a certain position and place that it almost feels painted.
The movie with that single shot tells us a story, some kind of manhunt or investigation. Well, that’s what a great photo achieves, to make the public imagine the reason of every element on the shot.
Tell a story with your elements
Just arrange the objects to give balance to your shot. And as the example shot shows: A little dramatic light always help.
This is actually very trendy among the photography and design community, but i’m not aware of the name of the trend, if you know it please leave me a note →
This one is the key aspect to make your photos look like the work of a pro (while you become one). The movie gave special attention to achieve symmetry to their shots. Perhaps that’s the main aspect I loved about The Grand Budapest Hotel (visually speaking), and the reason that lead me to write this article.
Make your shot stable, be sure your camera is completely vertical or horizontal and look for guides to help you give symmetry to your shot (Look at how the black tiles at the example helps to center the shot.)
Take your time
I suggest not to tilt your photos. I’ve seen very few pics on Instagram that work with a tilted crooked angle, the 1:1 aspect ratio pairs better with a flat horizon line. So, unless you’re absolutely conviced that the tilted angle will work, try to avoid it.The symmetry is the best friend of the aspect I explain next.
This is the ultimate “cheat” to make your squared Instagram photos look awesome. The cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman without a doubt loves the perspectives and we have the joy to experience many scenes like this one in the movie. (Similar to the Stanley Kubrick style)
This style draws your attention into the picture, creates movement in it and, virtually commands you to pay attention to the subject.
Give movement to your shot
The lines are everything. Take the example shot as a simple guide. Corridors, bridges or train tracks are ideal scenarios; make your perspective lines go to the corners of the frame, make it symmetrical (as I explained in the previous point); put one main subject at the center of the frame (max two subjects); and simply enjoy the moment. You’ll see the results. Your photos are gonna get a lot of ❤ on Instagram.
Now it’s up to you. Watch the movie, get inspired, follow this path and start shooting, you’re gonna love all of it.
Please, don’t get me wrong, i’m not saying this is the only way to shine at Instagram, but it’s certainly a beautiful path.
Here are some real examples of successful instagrammers of this style, follow them for an extra dose of inspiration. I II III IV V (I love the third one)
Thank you for reading!
This is my very first article and if you recommend it that will mean a lot to me. Let me know if you liked it. ☺Apologies if something is misspelled, I’m not very fluent at english.Share this article wherever you like. Thanks.

Overwhelming, volatile, passionate, affectionate, dependable and adoring.
Her emotions, like a wild storm gathering on a calm horizon, erupt without warning, casting doubt on my capacity and worth as a parent.
Despite our frequent squabbles, my teenage daughter approached me in October with travel plans for Fall break that felt more like a polished closing argument in a presidential debate. She artfully outlined her reasons for the trip, highlighted how it could strengthen our bond, and delivered a persuasive appeal for me to step away from my relentless 9-to-5 grind — stirring a sense of intrigue and the promise of much-needed relaxation.
It left a mark that lingered in my thoughts, pulling me in until I finally gave in.
A few weeks later, we were soaring above the clouds, Budapest-bound, carried by the thrill of reconnecting with old friends.
We touched down just past midnight, stepping into Budapest’s deserted streets, where every shadow seemed to echo the 12 years, I once called this city home. Meanwhile, I rehearsed the apartment code like a sacred verse, fearing my dead phone would turn this arrival into a pilgrimage of memory.

In Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel, the moments of absurdity are essential to understanding the humanity of the story and how our relationships with others are what defines our lives. Anderson is sure to never spend too long on one tragic moment alone and tends to bundle emotion, comedy, and danger together in a scene. These moments of comedy act as a device to distance the viewer from the dark realities of the story and are key to making the film enjoyable instead of altogether sad.
From the moment the film starts, we are distanced from the story. We see a young girl visit a tribute to the author of our tale, who then discusses the true story of his book as it was told to him by Zero in his later years. We are quickly aware of the lenses we are seeing the story through and the fact that it is a story. It is through the form of a story that we can pay attention to the greater themes that are discussed about the world and the relationships that develop.
When Gustave receives news of Madame D., he immediately heads off to the funeral, and abruptly takes Zero with him. “We must go to her.” “We must?” “She needs me, and I need you to help me with my bags and so on.” Although this is the way in which he asks Zero to go with him and has him pack wine and his bag for him, it becomes clear that Gustave wants to have someone by his side. Like Zero, Gustave is alone in this world and has no one else that he would trust to go with him. Gustave clearly feels a strong bond with Zero early on and treats him as a friend once they are outside the hotel, but Zero does not feel that same way immediately. Gustave pours him wine (which Zero does not drink) and plans that if things were to go south, they should run away together. Gustave even chooses Zero as his heir to his estate when he is gone. Zero is the closest thing that Gustave has to family and the hotel is the closest thing either of them has to a home. He admits to Zero (on Madame D’s death), “I blame myself. She tried to warn me…but I didn’t listen…There’s really no point to doing anything in life because it’s all gone in the blink of an eye.” This is a truly dreary perspective from Gustave that he counters with telling Zero how good she was in bed. They are then interrupted by the militiamen who enter the train and who Gustave tries to charm and joke with as he would with anyone else, to no avail. After they are assaulted when Zero’s papers are not in order, it is Gustave’s charm after all that saved them. Heckels telling Zero, “Your companion was very kind to me when I was just a lonely little boy,” showing Zero how, while his charms do not always work, Gustave can make a difference in people’s lives by treating them with care and respect. It is through their performance of careful care as hotel employees that they are both detached and closer than anyone else, and, by sharing this secret, Zero allows Gustave to be the closest thing to “real” that is possible.
When Gustave is arrested and in prison, he continues his role as concierge. Anderson highlights this role with the comedic lines of Gustave as he rolls his food cart past each of the cells, offering slop like it is fine cuisine; even salting it for a prisoner. He’s surrounded by hardened criminals and fighting, yet all he wants to do is make life as good for these people as he possibly can. He has Mendl’s smuggled in and shares it with his fellow prisoners, the group including Pinky who he got in an altercation with early on, the altercation itself showing that Gustave can break his act of charm when it suits him and that his desire for control is stronger than his facade. The group has even discussed that he’s “a real straight fellow,” and, “one of us now.” Gustave is delighted and surprised, as he is probably not thanked in the same way for his services in the hotel, as well as the fact that he is just treating the prisoners the way he would anyone else, likely seeing them in a very similar light, saying that even, “The most dreadful and unattractive person only needs to be loved and they will open up like a flower.” Living for the hotel and acting as a concierge are Gustave’s sole purposes in life and are why he does not let go of his duties even while behind bars, giving letters to Zero to read on his behalf to take care of the hotel the way that he would, even giving poems to recite just as he would to remind them that he and the hotel are one in the same. Gustave’s idea to have the digging tools smuggled in with the pastries, that the guard cannot bear to destroy, acts as a metaphor for the charms and kindness of Gustave being the only way to combat the brutishness and bad in the world.
When Gustave escapes through the sewer with the prisoners and meets with Zero, he is quite the opposite of his charming self and is in the shoes of the concierge as a boss and not as a companion. Zero has no disguises for them, no safe house and has not brought a bottle of l’air de panache for Gustave to freshen up with. While not essential to their plan, these things were all included in how Gustave would have done them himself had he been in control. This lack of authority in the moment and his distance from the hotel trigger him to go off on Zero. He condemns him for coming to Zubrowska as an immigrant, saying that if he does not know how to act that they’d be better off if he went back to where he came from. When Zero rebuts with the story of how his father and family were killed and how the violence of the war caused him to leave, Gustave realizes the error of his ways and apologizes, “On behalf of the hotel… Don’t make excuses for me. I owe you my life. You are my dear friend and protégé and I am very proud of you.” What seems to be a very low point of Gustave’s character has a sudden redemption arc when he realizes that these material things don’t matter at all if he hadn’t had Zero to help him. This is the turning point for Gustave seeing Zero as a friend or brother and the only relationship that truly matters to him. This moment is essential to the later scene where Gustave officiates Zero and Agatha’s wedding as well as Gustave’s final moments in the train car where all three have become a family and would fight for each other.
In all, The Grand Budapest Hotel acts as a tale of light within the darkness. It shows how stories of individuals and their relationships can make dire times appear much brighter. Anderson uses the bonds of Zero and Gustave, and later the addition of Agatha, to present a realistic portrayal of how life goes on when tragedy occurs and that all you can do is laugh and try to make the best of your situation. Anderson carefully weaves in the exaggeration of comedic situations and actions with the grim reality of Gustave being framed, people being murdered, and the government falling to a new regime in just a way that makes you think about what you’re watching and makes you question why you feel the way you do. Anderson’s narrative works because, before the viewer even realizes it, they are shown loyalty, love, war, and loss and are told to face it just as the characters are, head-on.

It was her fifth new date in as many weeks, and none of them had been a success. The men all appeared very attractive and almost perfect matches on the screen of her mobile phone. In real life, however, there was always something a bit off. Sometimes more than a bit.
Tonight, it was Jeff. Jeff had potential. Definitely handsome. Probably hadn’t lied about his age. Casual – both his outfit and his demeanour. It turned out his “college education” was a few months of online courses at a community college that had since closed down. He studied international hospitality but gave up when the family business needed his help. He now runs an industrial carpet cleaning firm. Pet odour removal is their specialty.
She’d been wondering if Jeff had noticed that her blazer was not freshly pressed. She’d convinced herself it wasn’t visible. Just to be on the safe side, though, she removed it after the appetiser. This manoeuvre put her full breasts on clear display, barely concealed by the cream-coloured dress she had chosen for the occasion.
Twenty-nine years old, chief researcher at a major pharmaceutical company, she was wondering what had gone wrong. Why did she have to drag herself to dates with strangers instead of curling up on the sofa in her cosy living room – book in one hand and a cabernet sauvignon in the other? Perhaps her father had been right. “You might as well move into a monastery. Just as likely you’ll meet someone there as locked up in your place.”
Jeff ventured into talking about politics just as the main course arrived. He sounded like he had rehearsed what he was saying, but his views were moderate, and for the most part, she found his points reasonable. Then his phone rang. He fished it out of his pocket, looked at the screen, and excused himself. She kept staring in front of her while he was gone, without touching the salmon on her plate.
When he returned, he sat, ran his fingers through his hair, and fidgeted with his shiny, oversized wristwatch.
Then he said, “Have I told you your nails are done beautifully?”

It was my husband’s 45th birthday in November 1989, and we went out to lunch.
I never went out to lunch. András and I never went out to lunch. There simply was no time in his life or in mine for such luxuries, but we did have reasons to celebrate — and plans to make.
The Berlin Wall had been crumbling for months before it came down that November. András had been watching the news with uncommon interest, both professionally, as a political scientist, and personally, as a boy who became a refugee when he and his family fled Soviet tanks during the 1956 Uprising.
His life was now full of teaching at Concordia University and consulting work; mine was filled with teaching at John Abbott College, publishing Matrix magazine, and editing fiction mss. for Véhicule Press. Both our lives were brimming over with our marriage, our three sons, our big house, a yellow Labrador named Hector, and our writing and research; I’d just finished writing my book on Hugh MacLennan’s Two Solitudes.
András was going to be on sabbatical from May 1990, and I’d had good news about a research grant that would release me from teaching for the next three years. We were going to leave this busy life behind, pack up our children and Hector, a few books and other belongings, and spend the year in Budapest.
That was the plan. And that was the start of the Budapest of my imagination.
It did work out, in most ways, but there were unpleasant surprises, along the way. The nastiest was learning that the man who rented our house was a crook. The loveliest was the fairytale hillside villa we moved into in Budapest in June, 1990. The fact that we ended up living there for two years rather than one was hardly any surprise at all.
The most miraculous surprise, for me, was that I was able to write a novel in Hungary.
We returned to Montreal in the summer of 1992, and Birds of Passage was published by Signature Editions in 1993. It’s been out of print for years and now, in a process of rediscovery, I’ve begun to serialize it here and here.
My own rediscovery of that early book, certainly, as I hadn’t reread it for decades.
A rediscovery of the Budapest of that pivotal time, when the first post-communist government elected in Hungary in June 1990 stumbled into something close to anarchy.
And a rediscovery of the hope that fledgling government represented — a hope already being dashed in our first months in Hungary, and a hope that looks poignantly, tragically over-optimistic when viewed in the dark light of today’s Hungary and today’s world.
I’ve never been an expert on Hungary.
I was a foreigner there with a limited understanding of the language. I had been there several times before, though, starting in 1972, and had always been one of only a few foreigners there. I was in the privileged position of having close contact with András, who is an expert, and with many other Hungarians through his extended family and close friends who had been dissidents under the old regime.
And I had daily contact, in my halting Hungarian and my almost-forgotten German, seldom in French and English, with neighbours, my sons’ friends, shopkeepers, my language teachers, and a widening circle of Hungarian writers and artists.
At that November lunch in Montreal, I dreamed I might have time to write while we were in Budapest. And I did start writing almost immediately after we settled in, keeping a journal, taking notes, working on what I thought might be an essay.
Only then, sometime in October 1990, history caught my imagination, and I found myself writing dialogue, structuring a story, and creating characters. I kept going all the next year, telling no one what I was doing, hardly daring to hope this would become a novel.
I was doing my research work, too, and I was editing manuscripts and working remotely with Matrix co-editor Kenneth Radu, designer Susan Valyi, and business manager Diane Hibbard on upcoming issues of the magazine — and, as the months went on, putting together a special issue of stories, poems and images by the writers, translators and artists I was meeting in Hungary. The title of that issue is “The Budapest of the Imagination.”
The rediscovery of Birds of Passage is the rediscovery, for me, of a city I loved and once knew quite well, for a foreigner.
It’s the rediscovery, too, of the person I was then — I was 40 years old in 1990 – and the warily hopeful and bedazzled eyes through which I saw that city at a time when it was impossible to guess what the future had in store for its world-weary denizens, its avian populations, myself, or my family.
Like this new Hungary, my literary career was just a fledgling in 1990. Blue Metropolis was nowhere on the horizon. I had no way of knowing I would one day be a publisher of other writers’ books. And the reason I never told anyone I was writing a novel is that I was afraid it would never get published.
I present it now for readers interested in a great city living through a period of turmoil; for anyone curious about the process of becoming a writer; for those few who will notice how literary mores have evolved in the intervening decades; for everyone mesmerized, as I am, by the power of the imagination; and for amateur ornithologists everywhere.

One of the beauties of this platform is that it allows me to publish chapters of a novel that’s long been out of print and, in the process reread it and reconsider it.
There are practical considerations. I have neither a Word version of the novel now, nor even a pdf, so I’ve been scanning the printed book, chapter by chapter. I then copy and paste each chapter into a Word document. This results in countless glitches I then edit —for “to” has repeatedly become “ot,” to take just that example, and entire paragraphs moved to another page. So, I’m looking for glitches as I reread, trying to catch them all, and making a (very) few other changes necessitated by the passage of time.
I haven’t read the novel as a whole since it was published in 1993, but I’ve now posted 7 of the novel’s 18 chapters online. And it’s a discovery — and not only because I’d forgotten so much of what I wrote in Hungary.
The woman I was 30 years ago is in many ways a stranger to me, for a start. And, as chapter follows chapter, I’m learning things I never knew about writing, about becoming a writer, about putting myself in other people’s shoes, pink or otherwise, and about the connections between writing and pivotal moments in a history, a story, a life.
I’ve been taking notes, this spring, for a new book, when I have half an hour to do so. I’m usually too busy, as I was in 1990, to sit down and just write.
In those days I was in the throes — of wrapping up a semester of teaching, research, editing a new issue of Matrix magazine, preparing another fiction manuscript for publication by Véhicule Press, walking Hector, preparing meals, taking my sons to music class, swimming, pottery.
And today, I’m on a family holiday in a world at war, playing with my grandson Remy, running a publishing business online, planning a boat ride on the Thames, pondering the meaning of family — and writing at 5 a.m. instead of sleeping.
Writing, in my experience, has always been what gets done when I should be doing something else. So, one surprise about Birds of Passage is that it ever got written.
I had forgotten much about Gábor, and almost everything about Eszter, Tivadar, Rudi, even Alice. I do remember focussing a lot of attention on Alice, in particular, for I didn’t want anyone to mistake her for me. In those days the inclusion of autobiographical traits was a favourite cavil in reviews of first novels written by women.
So I’d forgotten how unlike me Alice is, and how comical she can be. I’m both amused and bemused by her curious dress sense, her hair, her nose, her obsessive running, her jumpiness, her outspokenness — and her early career as a photographer with the Royal Ulster Constabulary, of all places.
1990 was a time of change. Every time is a time of change, personally and politically, it’s always both. Like right now, for example.
If I knew that Birds of Passage was a novel about change, though, I had forgotten the extent to which Northern Ireland — and Quebec — figure in the novel, which I remembered as being focused single-mindedly on Budapest.
That city has remained vivid in my memory, but the vividness is unspecific, so I’ve felt jolts of recognition when details in the novel remind me of so much I had forgotten — including the nesting Russian dolls with images of successive Soviet leaders that were on sale in those days on the streets of Budapest.
If I knew that Birds of Passage was a novel about change — everything I write being about change — I had forgotten the extent to which it’s also a novel about home. And about being homeless.
About nationalism, different nationalisms — the nationalisms of Hungary, of Ireland, of Canada and Quebec — that are not so very different from one another, at least to an outsider. And not that different from the nationalisms that are tearing the world apart right now.
The novel is about family, too, a subject that now interests me greatly, surrounded by three generations of my own family, travelling with them, attending a family wedding.It’s about love, about those who are close to you.About foreigners, too, and the foreigners who are close to you.About movement and migration, refugees, exiles, displaced persons, and expatriates, which include those closest to you.About what matters, and how what matters coalesces at key moments in a history, or a life.
I already knew, 30 years ago, that those moments were key, even if I had no way of knowing what would follow, what new vistas they might open up.
I now know what the next three decades had in store for me personally, and I know a lot more about how the future would unfold for Hungary and Ireland, too, not to mention Quebec.
And I now know my first novel did in fact get published; that’s what I hoped for, of course, when I lived in Budapest, hoping against hope. And that, too, has become part of my story. Which means my first novel does end up being in some way autobiographical, in spite of all.
I know much less Hungarian today than I did back then, and I know much less today about the marvellous, complicated city I loved and then left in 1992; that loss is part of the story, too.
And part of my own story. As is revisiting the novel on this platform today.
So, in some ways I don’t understand, Birds of Passage looks forward to a future it could not know, almost as though poised upon a peak in Darien.

Where to go when visiting Budapest?
Sure, you may want to get a little lazy and relax in Szecheny Thermal Baths, or climb the Gellért Hill to have a glance over the nightly Budapest, having a beer (or the famous Hungarian white dessert Tokaji aszú wine) sitting just by the feet of the Liberty Statue, there is a booming music scene n Budapest. And guess what, definitely worth checking out!
Aurora — Toldi — Golya — Ambient — Beat on the Brat — Keret — Durer Kert — Tinta Art Cafe — Larm — Kék ló —
Yes, there are many. And this is not a closed list.
But, for one who loves going for the specific music, here is the list.
If you are into electronic music, Aurora, Ambient and Larm would be the best bets. With Larm going for a dance and more or less techno-club style, Ambient is a more laid-back bar with an audience slightly more inclined to enjoy the drinks, instead of dancing. Aurora is the most un-clubbish of all three, with community centre being at its core, fighting for social rights. Still, you can enjoy some pretty awesome music there on Friday and Saturday nights.
Toldi is another good choice to go for. In daytime a cafe and a (good) movie theatre, it turns into a nightclub when the sun goes down. Located just by the Basilica, it is a good choice for those willing to take a stroll around the city before going clubbing.
Aurora and Golya will take a lead on this, with Durer Kert and Kek Lo following. Both being places hosting a wide set of events, these event avenues are mostly bar-like, welcoming people enjoying all sorts of music styles.
If a true vintage sound is what you are going for, Beat on the Brat is the fool-proof shot. At times feeling ridiculously small, it is a spot for the vintage-obsessed folk to get together at. You can hear everything, from swing to 80s rock, and meet one-of-a-kind people here. Located in the very centre, it is a great place to check out on your way to Larm or other mainstream clubs.
Summer is about to open the doors and bringing down roofs to allow music out. Durer Kert, A38 and Valyo Kikoto are all about open air music. On top of this, make sure not to miss the month of Budapest`s green bridge being locked for locals to enjoy weekend nights on! This is another post though. Stay tuned and meanwhile check the best deals from CuddlyNest!

We started our European River Cruise on a Viking Longship in Budapest! What a great place to begin our trip than surrounded by magnificent buildings and iconic bridges.
Our boat was docked by the Liberty Bridge. This bridge was started in 1894 and finished in 1896 in time for the Millennium World Exhibition. It is the shortest of Budapest’s three bridges (source).
It was built in the art nouveau style and originally named the Francis Joseph Bridge after the emperor who ruled Hungary at the time (source).
We got a good look at the Liberty Bridge on our second day in Budapest when we finished wandering the city’s Market Hall. From the market, we walked straight towards the river and found the Pest entrance of the bridge before us.
“Both portals are decorated with the coat of arms of Hungary designed by Virgil Nagy and two Turul statues each. Turuls are falcon-like birds, prominent in ancient Hungarian mythology.” —…

Much has changed in the literary firmament in the decades since I wrote Birds of Passage in 1990, and one of the most significant changes is our awareness as readers today of issues of cultural appropriation and the appropriation of voice.
Do I have the right to put myself in Gábor’s position? In that of other Hungarian characters, like Tivadar, István, Rudi, Kalliope and Magda?
Or in those Daniel, Pierrette, even Peter?
Is it only Indigenous stories that are out of bounds to me, as a writer with no Indigenous ancestry?
Are the stories of Black people are out of bounds to me, too? That of Alice’s husband Daniel, who is from Goa? How about that of Peter, Alice and Daniel’s mixed-race son?
And what other stories should I not be telling, as a white Canadian woman born in Belfast?
Those of male characters? Or not?
Those of Hungarians, given that I am not Hungarian?
What are the rules, exactly?And do they apply to any story that isn’t my very own?
No one seems too sure about all this, though it’s sometimes argued that these issues arise only (or mostly?) if, say, a white writer profits from their use of the stories of marginalized people.
The American poet Paisley Rekdal has explored this subject in her book Appropriate (Norton, 2021) and her Lithub piece, “Struggling in Workshop with the Question of Cultural Appropriation” (16 Feb 2021).
“Cultural appropriation,” Rekdal writes, “is less a question of ‘staying in one’s lane,’ …than an evolving conversation we must have around privilege and aesthetic fashion in literary practice.”
The English novelist Margaret Drabble argued in 2004 that “appropriation is what novelists do. Whatever we write is, knowingly or unknowingly, a borrowing. Nothing comes from nowhere.”
Having created Guyanese and Jewish characters for her novel The Witch of Exmore and an 18th- century Korean royal protagonist for The Red Queen, Drabble later revised her view in a Publishers Weekly interview, saying, “You can’t just barge in there and assume you have got the right to tell other people’s stories. You have to react sensitively to other people.”
Can that be it?
Is it a question of sensitivity? A question of quality? Is avoiding stereotypes key?
Avoiding stereotypes is always key, surely, but the question remains:
Did I have the right to write Birds of Passage?
It’s true that issues of appropriation were not in the forefront of public attention when I was writing the novel in the early 1990s, also that race is not particularly significant in its pages.
Next question:
Do I have the right to republish Birds of Passage today?
Yes?
No?
What is my “lane”?Am I allowed to write only about myself — out of my own personal experiences?
(As some of you are aware, I have done this several times, and it’s a practice that has sometimes landed me in hot water.)(And I seem to be writing about my own personal experience again, right now. Or, am I mistaken about that?)
Let me do my best to move on, through this thicket, for I do have another question:
What role, if any, is played in this by profit?

The Grand Budapest Hotel boasts a stellar cast, including Ralph Fiennes, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Willem Dafoe, Tilda Swinton, Adrien Brody, Jude Law, and Jeff Goldblum, among many others. However, the true star of the film is the hotel itself. Set in the fictional Eastern European state of Zubrowka (inspired by the spa city of Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic, and named after a Polish bison grass vodka), the film tells a short history of Eastern Europe in the 20th century through the lens of this once-grand establishment.
We witness the hotel in its gilded 1930s heyday, bask in its opulent glow, and then watch as the ravages of time and the Soviet era gradually erode its grandeur. Finally, we find it transformed into a faded relic, the inspiration for a cherished book in the present day. This ambitious narrative demanded a remarkable feat of production design. To capture the passage of time within the same in-film space, the filmmakers ingeniously constructed multiple sets, each intricately layered within the others, like a cinematic Russian nesting doll.
Production designer Adam Stockhausen, a frequent collaborator of director Wes Anderson who also worked on The Darjeeling Limited (2007), Moonrise Kingdom (2012), Isle of Dogs (2018), and The French Dispatch (2021), describes the filmmaking process of The Grand Budapest Hotel as akin to solving a complex puzzle. He candidly admits that The Grand Budapest Hotel presented one of the most formidable challenges of his illustrious career, a sentiment echoed by his experience crafting the intricate stage design for Charlie Kaufman’s film-within-a-film Synecdoche, New York (2008).
BackgroundBefore traveling to Europe for location scouting, Wes Anderson and Adam Stockhausen conducted extensive research, studying archival photographs of numerous hotels across various locations, including London, Scotland, and Switzerland. This research provided a foundation for their exploration, allowing them to identify potential sites that aligned with their vision for the film.
During their European travels, Anderson and Stockhausen drew significant inspiration from the historical narratives embedded within the real-world locations they encountered. A poignant example was a local civic centre, once a testament to architectural grandeur, now left to decay. Stockhausen vividly recalls the hammer marks that marred the intricate carvings, a stark reminder of the passage of time and the erosion of beauty.
The town of Karlovy Vary in Czech Republic, with its picturesque pastel-coloured buildings lining the riverfront and its collection of elegant hotels perched on overlooking hills, perfectly captured the desired aesthetic and mood for the film. Its unique atmosphere ultimately inspired the choice of this location as the primary outdoor shooting site.
Bristol Palace HotelWhile Grandhotel Pupp is often cited as the primary aesthetic inspiration for Wes Anderson’s fictional Grand Budapest Hotel, the Bristol Palace Hotel in Karlovy Vary bears a more striking resemblance to the film’s iconic structure. Its distinctive pink facade, adorned with mansard roof, dormer windows, flanking turrets, and a stag atop its peak, was remarkably replicated in the film, creating a visually striking homage that almost appears like a hyper-realistic, larger-than-life version of the Bristol Palace.
The Bristol Palace Hotel is an integral part of the Bristol Group complex, a collection of seven buildings developed by two prominent Karlovy Vary families: the esteemed physician Dr. Willem Fasolt and the renowned hotelier family, the Tellers. Between 1872 and 1908, they constructed several properties in the tranquil “Westend” district of the city, including the Bristol Villa (now the Bristol Palace Hotel), Königsvila (Královská Villa), Teresa (Tereza), and Fasolt (now Livia), all intended to provide a haven for hospitality and relaxation.
Designed by Viennese architects Hans Schidl and Alfred Bayer in the spirit of Viennese historicism, the Bristol Palace Hotel showcases a captivating blend of architectural styles inspired by castle architecture. Recognised as one of the most valuable and visually appealing buildings in the Czech Republic, the iconic Bristol Palace Hotel should not be confused with the larger Hotel Bristol, the main building within the Bristol Group complex. The latter was constructed on the site of a former Jewish synagogue, tragically destroyed during the Nazi-orchestrated Kristallnacht in 1938.
Grandhotel PuppWhile Adam Stockhausen often cited Grandhotel Pupp as a major inspiration for The Grand Budapest Hotel, many believe the film draws more inspiration from the hotel’s dramatic location — perched on a hill, surrounded by forest, and overlooking the town of Karlovy Vary — and its overall sense of grandeur.
The 228-room Grandhotel Pupp significantly surpasses the Bristol Palace Hotel in size and age. Its history dates back to 1907 with the construction of the Saxony Hall by Anton Deiml, then Mayor of Karlovy Vary. Subsequently, Mayor Becher built the Bohemian Hall on adjacent land, creating direct competition. The Pupp family acquired the Saxony Hall in 1776 and later the Bohemian Hall in 1890. Between 1896 and 1907, renowned Viennese architects Fellner & Helmer transformed these family-owned buildings into the neo-Baroque Grandhotel Pupp that stands today. This rich and intricate history is meticulously detailed on the hotel’s official website.
Grandhotel Pupp boasts a distinguished guest list, having welcomed a diverse array of luminaries throughout its history. From the intellectual giants like Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud and Czech writer Franz Kafka to renowned composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Richard Wagner, and even historical figures like Russian astronaut Yuri Gagarin and statesmen Napoleon Bonaparte and Otto von Bismarck, the hotel has played host to a veritable who’s who of history.
Grandhotel Pupp made a cinematic appearance in the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale, where it served as the fictional Hotel Splendide, set in Montenegro.
Görlitz WarenhausWes Anderson sought a realistic location for filming the Grand Budapest Hotel’s interiors and discovered the vacant Görlitz department store, an abandoned building that allowed complete artistic control and time flexibility. This twentieth-century Görlitz Warenhaus, with its impressive atrium, became the centrepiece of the production. The atrium itself was transformed into the hotel lobby, while the open galleries of the surrounding floors were adapted into hotel corridors, complete with meticulously placed hotel rooms.
To furnish these spaces, the production team meticulously sourced furniture and decor from various eras, ensuring authenticity within the film’s timeline. The top two floors of the department store were repurposed to house production offices and storage for cameras and wardrobe. During the ten-week shoot in early 2013, the entire film crew, including actors Tilda Swinton, Willem Dafoe, and Ralph Fiennes, resided at the neighbouring Hotel Börse.
The site of the Görlitz Warenhaus has a rich history. In 1717, it housed the “Goldener Strauß” (Golden Ostrich) inn, which later expanded into a hotel. Inspired by the renowned Wertheim department store on Leipziger Platz in Berlin, the Görlitz city council envisioned a similar establishment at this location. Potsdam architect Carl Schmanns designed the “department store at the ostrich,” and construction commenced in 1912 after the demolition of the existing hotel. Built with a steel skeleton and adorned with an Art Nouveau facade, the department store opened to the public on 30 September 1913.
The Görlitz Warenhaus experienced multiple changes in ownership, and at one point, Anderson even considered purchasing the building to prevent its demolition. In June 2013, investor Winfried Stöcker acquired the property with plans to revive it as a department store. However, the reopening faced numerous delays, initially planned for 2016 and then for the fall of 2017, due to the realisation that extensive restoration and renovation were necessary.
In November 2020, the project encountered a significant setback when a dispute arose concerning the demolition of two neighboring buildings. Stöcker sought to demolish these structures to improve delivery access to the store and a nearby parking garage. However, the local landmark preservation office mandated their preservation. This impasse led to Stöcker threatening to abandon the entire project if demolition was not permitted.
The smallest detailsOccasionally, the scope of a film’s vision surpasses the limitations of physical sets. In such instances, the filmmakers must employ creative solutions. For The Grand Budapest Hotel, this involved a skillful blend of practical and digital techniques, utilizing matte paintings and miniature effects to convincingly create the illusion of grandeur and scale. Wes Anderson, while primarily favouring practical filmmaking, recognises the value of post-production techniques like visual effects, colour timing, and other digital enhancements, when necessary.
This approach is evident from the very beginning of the film. The introduction scene to the hotel involves a sweeping horizontal movement across the landscape. It culminates in a dramatic reveal of the hotel perched majestically atop a hill, with a funicular ascending towards it. This specific image was intentionally created using miniatures, as no such location exists in reality. This technique harkens back to the classic Hollywood tradition of utilising models to achieve desired cinematic effects.
Under the guidance of Simon Weisse, a team of skilled prop makers at Studio Babelsberg in Berlin meticulously constructed scale models of the structures, working in tandem with the production team at the Görlitz Warenhaus. The Grand Budapest Hotel set, featuring the hotel building atop a wooded ledge complete with a funicular, was meticulously crafted. This was further enhanced by a Friedrichian landscape painting seamlessly integrated with green-screen technology. The 3-meter-high hotel model was meticulously sculpted using silicone resin molds and adorned with intricate brass embellishments. To create the illusion of light, photographs of the Görlitz Warenhaus set were strategically placed within the model’s windows.
To achieve the aged, brutalist aesthetic of the Soviet-era Grand Budapest Hotel, the visual effects team employed a combination of computer-generated models, intricate lighting, matte effects, and carefully orchestrated shadows. A similar technique was utilised to create the observatory, where the base miniature was constructed in separate pieces. The observatory was rendered with 20 distinct elements, with the final digital rendering refined further at Anderson’s request, requiring approximately one hour per shot.
Costume designer Milena Canonero meticulously captured the essence of each character through their wardrobe. While the hotel uniforms adhered to the stylistic conventions of the 1930s, the color palette was intentionally unconventional. The majority of the costumes were crafted within the Görlitz Warenhaus workshop, with additional pieces sourced from Berlin-based Theaterkunst and the uniforms produced by a Polish workshop. The filmmakers drew inspiration from renowned artists such as photographers Man Ray and George Hurrell, and painters Gustav Klimt, Kees van Dongen, Tamara de Lempicka, and George Grosz.
Just as Wes Anderson enlisted Marc Jacobs, then creative director of Louis Vuitton, to design period-inspired suitcases for The Darjeeling Limited, he commissioned Miuccia Prada to create a 21-piece set of luggage for Madame D. (Tilda Swinton) and Concierge Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) in The Grand Budapest Hotel. Drawing inspiration from the 1920s and 1930s, when Prada primarily focused on leather goods, the luggage showcases exquisite turn-of-the-century finishes and the iconic Grana Paglia pattern. While not a central plot point, these meticulously crafted pieces leave a lasting impression on the viewer.
Graphic designWes Anderson enlisted graphic designer Annie Atkins to bring the fictional world of The Grand Budapest Hotel to life. Previously an art director at McCann Erickson in Reykjavik, Iceland, Atkins was relatively new to film design. She meticulously designed nearly every on-screen artefact bearing text — ubrowka money, police reports, passports, telegrams, pastry packaging, perfume lettering, and even a prison map.
To achieve this, Atkins drew inspiration from reference materials meticulously collected by herself, Anderson, and production designer Adam Stockhausen during extensive location scouting. Her dedication was evident in her meticulous process, often sketching 20 variations of a single artefact by hand daily. This painstaking effort paid off, allowing her to keep cherished mementos like the iconic The Grand Budapest Hotel book, a Mendl’s box, and a bloodstained telegram from Serge the butler.
Atkins’s attention to detail extended beyond the screen. She adapted the hotel’s entrance sign from a 1930s metal sign Anderson discovered in Cairo, creating a hand-drawn version with somewhat uneven, jaunty serifs. Even objects unseen on screen, like Ralph Fiennes’ character Gustave H’s notebook, received meticulous consideration. Fiennes preferred lined pages, though, reflecting the character’s personality, a detail that Wes loves.
The fictional newspapers in The Grand Budapest Hotel — The Trans Alpine Yodel, The Daily Fact, and The Continental Drift — showcase Anderson’s meticulousness. He wrote every story, regardless of on-screen appearance or relevance to the main plot, and Atkins designed each newspaper accordingly. Authenticity was paramount. Atkins even studied Hitler’s calling card to design a business card for a fascist character in the film.
For those seeking to replicate the “aged” look of props, Atkins offers a practical tip: use three Barry’s tea bags to age paper by ten years. Even if props are new within the film’s narrative, the audience expects an “old” aesthetic for a period piece.
DigitalTo further immerse audiences in the world of The Grand Budapest Hotel, a fictional website called the Akademie Zubrowka was created. This online platform, reminiscent of the 1960s, offered a series of stylised lessons on the history of the fictional Republic of Zubrowka.
Designed to seamlessly blend the aesthetics of the late 1960s with the 1930s setting of the film, the Akademie Zubrowka website mimicked a microfiche machine, complete with a navigational wheel to guide viewers through the digital “slides.” Photographs were meticulously recreated to resemble hand-coloured black-and-white prints, further enhancing the nostalgic ambiance.
Watson Digital, working closely with Fox Searchlight and director Wes Anderson himself, produced the entire site in-house. This collaborative effort allowed Anderson to fully explore and develop the stylised fictional world he envisioned, including an unusual amount of written content. While this presented a design challenge, the team embraced the opportunity to work directly with the director to bring his vision to life.
The Akademie Zubrowka was met with enthusiastic reception from fans of Anderson’s work. It provided a unique opportunity to delve deeper into the film’s world and was featured in publications such as Variety and MovieWeb.
Unfortunately, the Akademie of Zubrowka website was discontinued around 2018. However, interested viewers can still explore it through the Wayback Machine. Alternatively, if you ever had the pleasure of staying at the fictional Grand Budapest Hotel, you might consider sharing your experiences by writing a review on its (fictional) TripAdvisor page here.
The Grand Budapest Hotel was basically a critical darling, showing up on tons of critics’ “best of” lists. Everyone raved about how incredibly well-crafted it was, especially its zany vibe and that signature Wes Anderson touch. On Rotten Tomatoes, a whopping 92% of 319 critics gave it the thumbs up, while Metacritic gave it a fancy score of 88 out of 100 based on 48 reviews. The film’s Akademie Zubrowka also won numerous awards including one Webby in 2015.
At the 87th Academy Awards, the film received nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Film Editing. It ultimately won awards for Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and Best Original Score, which you can hear below.

Illusions of Grandeur in THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL
“To be frank, I think his world has vanished long before he ever entered it. But I will say, he certainly sustained the illusion with a marvelous grace.” — Zero Mustafa, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL
The key to survival in Wes Anderson’s 2014 film “The Grand Budapest Hotel” is keeping up appearances. Though the film is presented in Anderson’s trademark pristine dollhouse-like style, the world within it can be as nasty and ruthless as our own. One look at a poster for the film with its pastel colored buildings and calligraphic lettering gives no indication that the film will that feature brutal prison shankings, a beheading, and an extended shootout occuring on several floors of the eponymous hotel.
But that’s the artistry at work in Wes Anderson’s masterpiece: what appears to be merely a light, madcap romp turns out also to be a rather melancholy tale of two social climbers learning that there are dangers in the ritzy world of the upper class no different from the ones they’ve escaped.
Our two leads Zero and Monsieur Gustave are outsiders dealing in matters far above their pay grade, and only survive by taking heed to the old adage “act like you’ve been here before”.
Zero, whom we meet as the unassuming Lobby Boy and loyal sidekick of Monsieur Gustave turns out to be a refugee of Anderson’s version of WWII and the eventual owner of the hotel. Behind his big, watchful eyes hides a painful past filled with memories of the family he lost in the war.
While Gustave’s past is never quite so defined, we know from his own words he also came from humble beginnings, even once having served as Lobby Boy himself. What’s most fascinating about Gustave is that the persona he displays throughout the movie is a whole cloth fabrication. He’s no more a member of high-society than Zero, though he’d never let you know and you’d never be able to tell. He’s absorbed his regal, professional disposition from the aristocrats and old-money figures who frequent the hotel.
When the pair escape the home of the DeGoff und Taxis family with “Boy with Apple” in tow, they do so by doing their best to blend in and not draw attention to themselves (despite their loud purple uniforms). It isn’t until Gustave announces his presence that anyone even notices the two were there to begin with. And this isn’t the only time they find a way to look the part. Much of the last act is filled with the two changing in and out of various disguises in order to keep themselves out of early graves.
On two occasions we see Zero and Gustave aboard a train whose path is blocked by soldiers. searching for refugees. On these occasions, Zero escapes the firing squads his family fell victim to on the strength of Gustave’s good name, — “he’s with me” Gustave assures the soldiers — while Gustave survives (at least once) due to his aristocratic manner and past kind deeds, but a kind, aristocrat is not exactly who he is. Outside of his duties as concierge, Gustave can be rather profane, bitter, vain, rude, insensitive, and even crass, but he knows when to turn on the charm. That charm gets him brief access to the finest things Anderson’s world has to offer. Until it doesn’t.
Ultimately, Gustave meets that early grave he’d been eluding. The costume he wears can’t get him through every door or out of every jam. Being a rich, vain, blonde doesn’t save his life in the end, and truth be told, it never did. The character of “Monsieur Gustave H. of the Grand Budapest Hotel” gave him entree into this fanciful world, but it doesn’t protect him within it. What saves Gustave is his willingness in his darkest moments to strip away all (most) pretense and meet Zero and others on their level. Not as the concierge of an esteemed hotel, but as a helpless man who had no one else to turn to. For it isn’t any of his rich lovers who break him out of prison. His escape is made with the help of some lowly inmates and his loyal lobby boy. It’s not until he hears Zero’s story and feels his pain that they truly connect and become as Zero puts it “brothers”.
What Gustave internalizes in the end is that what endears one most to others is the way you treat them. No one likes Gustave because he’s posh or learned, they like him because of his meticulous attention to detail, his loyalty, and being as Captain Henckels puts it “very kind”. That kindness and care is what wins over his man lady “friends”, it’s what wins over his cutthroat cellmates, and it’s what fully wins over his eventual heir, Zero.

Note: Most review fragments taken from the author’s Reddit review.
I must be the most pathetic movie aficionados to not get the chance to watch Wes Anderson movies. I’ve heard the words: picturesque, aesthetic, symmetrical. All-in-all satisfying. I’ve heard The Grand Budapest Hotel in years, yet it’s only in 2021 where I get to watch it, 7 years after its release.
Can I just open by saying how I love myself after this? Because finally, finally, anticipation is paid off. Nearly-decade long anticipation. It is rare for a movie to leave me so amused as if I have just littered by mouth with foams of fluffy clouds. It’s like marijuana, but visual, coming from Disney, and legal. At least, in some states — OK, I admit, I have a bad sense of humour.
Nobody shall deny that this is splendid. If you’re looking for a movie to relax and to improve your eyesight, this could be one. A vintage yet faithful depiction of a fascist regime framed by slapstick humour. Often movies can’t blend various elements, but The Grand Budapest Hotel does it right. The cinematography, visuals, and editing are to die for — I can’t stress this enough. The hype is not overhyped, it seems for the first time. There are some issues, though, with the brightness (it often feels too bright), and I don’t understand why a squared aspect ratio is preferred for the modern-day but widescreen is used for the late 60s and 80s.
But also, nobody can deny that there is a flaw in this movie. A huge, huge flaw. It is not delivered well.
The first minutes are nothing short of a masterpiece. Somehow I find the way Madame saying “I’m not leaving” funny, it sounds like a rom-com satire. The inciting incident is expressed naturally, so I have few complaints.
Amid it, the movie starts falling apart, apart from the camerawork, acting, and grandeur overture. Considering the prologue and first two parts takes a long time, I expect the remaining time to be much more, not specifically longer, but more elements. Right now the main plot is easily predictable: there’s gonna be a winter prison break, and a kiddie fight for Boy with Apple.
Right now, the cinematography is misleading. It is like a visual drug to keep you awake on a starting-to-get-boring movie. Kinda the same for the acting. Some of the throwaway plot points still remain enjoyable, but they don’t contribute to improving the plot. Because of the nature of the movie, everything feels trivial and I don’t connect with the characters anymore.
The ending is melancholic and satisfying. But a large part of “satisfying” is, “Finally! This movie is over I kinda… knew it.” I didn’t feel anything, other than the common chills I get every time I see a movie. I didn’t feel moved or questioning things or stuff like that. Except I did question one thing: “Why did they choose that font for the subtitles?”
The Grand Budapest Hotel is not a cursed premise nor an unnatural narrative. It explores controversial and strong themes, with great technical work. But Wes Anderson did not seem to dive deeper into the script, rather only anticipated in shooting it. The movie is a fine work. But it’s not great, and can do better. Nobody can deny, though, that Gustave’s legacy will carry on for long on the big screen.

Sitting in the Dark
Like most survivors of extreme trauma, my father Laszlo never talked about what he had endured during and after WWII. Such avoidance is understandable — why bring back pain so mercifully repressed with the help of time, distractions, and forgetfulness? Why relive reminders of suffering and death, when the guilt of survival is already too much to bear?
Laszlo never spoke much, anyway, facilitating his evasion while exacerbating my curiosity. Weekday nights he’d come home from work at 5pm, demanding dinner on the table. We ate with my mother in awkward silence, or cowering from his wrath. From there he sat in his big chair in front of the TV, reading the paper until 10pm. Off to bed, rinse and repeat.
One random night the power went out, no television and no light to read his newspaper. As we lit candles and sat in the flickering shadows, I asked him again about the war. The few times I tried were failures, Laszlo wondering why I would care, why would anyone care, since he and his family suffered to the indifference of their neighbors, and the world.
He made a good point, but that night I gave it another whirl, and — surprise surprise — he started to speak slowly in his native Hungarian, buried words arduously clawing to the surface. He had a deep, Bela Lugosi voice, and I felt as though The Grinch Who Stole Christmas were narrating The Bombing of Budapest. We journeyed to Hungary in 1944, only thirty years before…
That summer an average of ten thousand people were murdered per day in the camps. Meanwhile, sixteen-year-old Laszlo lived large at a refurbished Jewish Community Center taken over by the Gestapo and SD. He was part of the expendable local help that had been rounded up by the Germans soon after the Tiger tanks clanked through the cobbled Budapest streets.
Jewish talent was recruited by the Germans across various trades: tailors, seamstresses, carpenters, electricians. Laszlo was chosen by his high school principal as designated draftsman, price paid for being the most talented in shop class. The Nazis gave him his own secretary and office — he decorated it with mounted animal heads ripped from a taxidermist’s shop.
Laszlo was a tall, dashing, Errol Flynn-looking kid with a deeply cynical sense of humor, and the Übermensch thought he was cool. Laszlo thought the tall, dashing, blond-haired blue-eyed Aryans were cool, too, creating an odd Ashkenazi-Nazi dynamic. Entertaining them as class clown and mascot, they printed official documents making him an officer in the SD.
Laszlo felt invincible as most teens do, and had no idea what was soon in store, including a brush with Adolf Eichmann, being caught playing cards on the job, nearly beaten to death and thrown into solitary confinement, released with no shoes into the wintry Siege of Budapest, hidden in a neighbor’s cellar, and nearly deported to Siberia by the Russians.
At some point between sharing air with Eichmann and being tortured, Laszlo sat in his office one summer evening, drawing Wehrmacht uniform insignia and various armaments. The air raid siren went off, staffers panicked. Above them the B-24 Liberators from the Fifteenth Expeditionary Air Force were in formation, attacking the city.
The heavy aircraft dropped mines into the Danube River, and bombs onto Hungarian factories, refineries, and oil tanks. They also released leaflets throughout Budapest that boldly threatened the enemy with retribution for deporting thousands of Jews to the gas chambers in Auschwitz. The world was watching, they said — too bad the Allies didn’t actually try to stop it.
Seeing the Light
“We must go downstairs to the shelter!” the secretary shrieked, rushing into his office. Weighing whether to follow her and use the fog of war to try and get some nookie, or see what was going on, he opted for the latter. “A direct hit kills us all, anyway,” he said. “So I’m going up to the roof. Want to join me?” Despite his resemblance to Errol Flynn, she fled into the bunker.
He went up, not down, made himself comfortable on the rooftop, and watched the show. Search lights darted across the sky, as anti-aircraft flak burst around the illuminated bomber formations and escorting fighter squadrons. Laszlo watched streams of incendiaries pour out of the big planes, saw the distant explosions as factories and depots erupted.
An unlucky Liberator took a direct hit, left wing breaking off as the bomber dipped and plummeted. Spiraling downward, several parachutes became visible, bobbing dreamily as they floated serenely over the roiling city. Laszlo wondered what being an allied serviceman flying in those planes and now shot down must be like, descending into a strange city at war.
As a kid, Laszlo loved watching American movies, and like most Europeans romanticized the States based on Hollywood films. His emulation of Errol Flynn was no accident, the actor smoothly embodying the epitome of a swashbuckling lady’s man. Laszlo loved him in The Adventures of Robin Hood. Bored in class, he dreamt of some day becoming a Yankee Doodle.
As a teen, Laszlo watched the real life show of swiveling beams reflect off the flak bursts and vapor trails, as the surviving heavy bombers released their loads and flew back to safety, the anti-aircraft fire dying down and search lights thinning. Still alive, he trundled back downstairs and returned to his office. “You are crazy!” his secretary said, duly impressed.
Everything went back to “normal” until about an hour later, when Laszlo heard commotion and loud, guttural German voices outside his office. He went to his door, opened it, and saw his Nazi buddies standing nearby chatting, pointing, and calling out. One of the parachuting bombardiers had been caught, and was now put on display for his merciless captors.
Three decades later in flickering candle light, Laszlo shared his wonder at making direct eye contact with his first American: A young man only a few years older, red haired and freckled, wearing a US airman’s uniform and boots. Beaten, his face was covered in gashes and welts — too weak to walk, he was dragged down the hallway, his crimson blood trailing behind.
Laszlo knew nothing about the Geneva Conventions, and neither did the Gestapo, who tortured Laszlo’s First American to death a few doors down the hall. As I watched my father speak, I imagined young Laszlo at his desk beneath the mounted animal heads, trying to concentrate as the young US flyer cried out. American dream turned to nightmare, an ominous sign?
Only a few months earlier, Laszlo was hanging out with his friends, complaining about his parents, ignoring his younger brother, trying to get laid, and wondering about his future when the most brutal war in human history literally came knocking at his door. Of the hundred or so students in his high school class, only sixteen survived. He was one of them.
The price usually paid for survival is guilt: “Why was I spared, and not the others?” Another cost is the jealousy, defeatism, and victimization that guilt-ridden survivors hurl at their own families. A few decades after that fateful evening, Laszlo stared into the face of another American — his first and only son. I likely filled him with equal curiosity, wonder, and terror.

Apart from one firecracker set off one day early, a neighbor having a short but noisy party in the late evening, and a couple waking me up with their rather loud orgasms the morning after, there was no real sign of celebration.
I traveled to Budapest on the 27th of December, thinking that New Year’s Eve (NYE) may be like Christmas in Budapest; everything including the busses shuts down around 3 PM, and if you’re unlucky enough not to have booked a taxi then you aren’t likely to go anywhere unless you are walking. And many people do. From morning until late afternoon, you will see people out for ‘walks’, but they are actually on their way to where they are celebrating Christmas Eve. They’ll be dressed in moderately nice clothes and carrying wine bottles or other enjoyable Christmas things. However, NYE is not all like like Christmas Eve in this bohemian city — people just don’t care that much — and this surprised me enough to jump into an air balloon — literally.
You see, when I realized that I had again made a booboo — last year I knew nothing about busses shutting down and ended up needing to get picked up by family members — and that I should have booked myself onto a NYE boat trip or some form of party for tourists, I was rather upset. Not even my cousin…

It wasn’t a long time ago when I asked Stefan about his work, but here comes a new interview, since he has just finished another drawing on Budapest. Let’s find out what has happened to him since last September.
What has happened to you since we spoke last year?All of a sudden, things went really fast after our first interview. Apart from two successful exhibitions in Holland, the media took note of my work last December, which led to newspaper publications in the UK, Belgium, Holland and Italy and a score of Internet publications. Later on, in January, I was invited to appear on the Belgian national television in a talk show named Bart and Siska. Currently, I’m preparing work for a number of future exhibitions in Holland and Switzerland later this year.
If you speak Dutch here is the video for you to watch:http://www.een.be/programmas/bart-siska/tekentalent-stefan-bleekrode
You have just finished another drawing on Budapest. Could you tell us about the process? The initial large-scale drawing was merely based on Budapest; I used the architecture and many landmarks to create a “new” city based on Budapest. I wasn’t entirely satisfied with that work because of the faulty perspective and somewhat monotonous background. Immediately, I felt I needed to do another piece sometime. It took me almost two years to meditate on this new piece that had to include not just most of the famous sights but also offers a view more captivating than the previous drawing.
The perspective plays a major role in all of Stefan’s works. He is well known for drawing from a bird’s eye perspective so I was eager to hear about how the process went this time. Furthermore, Budapest also belongs to that group of cities that offer a lot of possibilities for artists to capture it on their artworks. Last time Stefan was flying from the Liberty Bridge towards the Margaret Island, but now he has begun his trip in District 13.
How did you decide on the perspective of the drawing this time?This perspective was in my mind already for quite a long time but it took me a while to get things sorted out, and not until my previous visit to Budapest, last year in May, I felt confident enough to tackle what was really quite a difficult subject. When I walked around the city I noticed there were many geometric forms, for instance the street layout and the rooftop angles. This perspective is broken by straight and diagonal boulevards, and the river running across the city. Getting the perspective right was essential.
Before I did any ink drawing I made extensive pencil sketches to get the composition right. So I made the Saint Stephen’s Boulevard shorter than in reality and left some of the area South of it out of the drawing. To make the drawing a bit less monotonous, an endless sea of roofs, I made Elisabeth Square and Déak Square bigger, kind of turned it into a park. Still, even as I went along I kept making changes: I made the river wider, and later on I decided to raise the horizon a bit and obscure it with a watercolour wash.
Stefan’s success cannot be only seen in the media but he actually makes a living as an artist, which does not necessarily happen to everyone who dedicates her/his life to art. Stefan is an exception as he has sold several of his artworks and probably will sell many more. Let’s find out where one should look for the new drawing(s)!
What happens to it now?The drawing got sold immediately upon completion to a Dutch family who used to live in Budapest for three years. I suppose it will be framed now before the buyers collect it from the gallery.
Are you planning to draw more pieces on Budapest?Yes, there’s already a small drawing under construction of a busy intersection with trams and buses, similar to Astoria. Maybe one day I’ll do a view of Buda Castle and the old district next to it. Other than that, I was thinking of doing perhaps a city like Pécs, I haven’t been there yet but it is apparently very beautiful.
Unfortunately, we still have to wait for an exhibition taking place in Hungary, but if you happen to be in the Netherlands or Switzerland, take the opportunity and visit one of the galleries showcasing Stefan’s pieces. Stefan is naming the destination in his last answer.
If someone is interested in seeing your works in person where s/he should go?My work is currently on sale and display at the Frank Welkenhuysen Gallery in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Besides this, I’ll have a show with oil colours at Galerie Müller in Luzern this summer and more drawings will go on display at Keine Kunst in Bern this fall. But it would be great to show some of my Hungary-inspired pieces in Budapest or elsewhere!

I will never forget the first time I saw the Danube. It was my first time in Budapest, and, as I walked toward the impressive world-famous Hungarian Parliament Building, I saw the beautiful city lights reflected on the river’s peaceful waters under the pink and purple sunset. I was speechless.
Hungary is most known for its fascinating capital, Budapest, recently considered the second best city to visit in Eastern Europe in U.S. News ranking and included in Time’s World’s Greatest Places in 2023. However, this country has much more to offer to international visitors and tourism has significantly recovered in the past few years.
Data Confirms Travelers Want To Explore Hungary And Love Budapest
More than 6 million international travelers explored the country this summer 2023. According to Statista, most foreign visitors are from neighboring countries: Slovakia, Romania, and Austria.
However, especially in Budapest, you can encounter travelers from all over the world. This is a relief as it’s easier to communicate in English and it is the most common language used in tourist places and among visitors. I tried to learn a few words in Hungarian but couldn’t get past “thank you” — Köszönöm — , and I quickly understood why Hungarian is considered one of the most difficult languages in the world. Luckily, this is not a barrier to visiting, but tour guides do help provide a much more enriching experience.
The Hungarian government said that tourism exceeded their expectations in 2022 and that this year the records will show higher rates compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019. And it’s easy to see why this destination attracts more travelers.
Hungary Is A Perfect Destination For Pleasure And Relaxation
There are over 1,300 thermal water springs — Budapest is home to more than 100 — where tourists can relax and experience the best of Hungarian culture most times of the year. From historical places with outstanding architecture to calming retreats in rural areas.
Travelers usually enjoy eating local food with unique flavors and exotic combinations. I can now say that the goulash is one of my favorite soups, and the Hungarian pizza, the Langallo, must be added to any traveler’s bucket list.
Enriching Experiences Beyond Food And Spas
Hungary has so much to offer. Those who enjoy a fun night can have a special time at the ruin bars or try one of Budapest’s top attractions: take a Danube River cruise.
History lovers will be amazed at all the drama related to Empress Elisabeth of Austria — known as Sissi — and can also admire the sculptures and all the incredible stories behind them.
Even though the predominant religion is Catholic, visitors can see fascinating buildings and chapels from different religions like the Great Synagogue of Budapest — the largest in Europe — or Matthias Church on Castle Hill in Budapest.
Depending on your travel plans, there are also festivals, events, and new attractions. Hungary is one of those destinations that make you want to go back even before you leave.

Budapest, Hungary.
We've had fun over these last few weeks trying to figure out how to ask the most basic of questions, “Do you speak English” which at face value doesn't sound overly difficult. You would be mistaken. Our brains are like sieves and as quick as I pour the “Sprechen Sie Englisch?”, “mluvíš anglicky” and “beszélsz angolul” in, it falls right back out. Personally, I blame the internet.
As you start getting hit with travel fatigue and a loss of direction on big trips like these, there are some cities which pull you right back into the fray and make you realise how beautiful Europe during Christmas can be. Budapest certainly falls into this category and after almost two months, two continents and nine countries deep we needed it.
Our first few days saw us checking out the usual city landmarks of castles, churches and Christmas markets and they certainly didn't disappoint in any way. The awe-inspiring Buda Castle in the aptly named Castle district where we visited an underground labyrinth (used as a war shelter, jail and even linked to Dracula!) was amazing. The stunning St Stephens Basilica and Fishermans Bastion; everywhere you look there is something gorgeous and jaw-dropping.
The highlight of this city was definitely the natural hot spring baths of Széchenyi, opened in 1913 and looking the part. Three huge outdoor pools (25°C–35°C) and a multitude of indoor pools, spas and steaming hot saunas. The snow falling all around and -4°C at arrival made it even more special. I highly recommend Budapest to anyone and everyone.
Christmas day was spent in Krakow, Poland and was indeed a white one. I will say it was a quiet few days for us as George came down with a nasty bout of the flu. I took to the streets myself and kept the step counter going by walking the wet and snowy alleys and side paths. Up to Wawel castle, through the Jewish quarter and around Old town.
While in Krakow we visited the Auschwitz concentration camp for the day. It sits about 60kms out of Krakow, it covers a massive area, contains multiple different camps and is about as sombre as you can imagine. It didn't feel right to take a heap of photos or selfies out of consideration for every one that passed through this place so I've only included a couple of the complex.
Next stop is Warsaw and then the Baltic states for New Year's Eve. Bring it on.
Gary.

Here is my take on this exercise from a previous series of posts — How To Read A Screenplay:
After a first pass, it’s time to crack open the script for a deeper analysis and you can do that by creating a scene-by-scene breakdown. It is precisely what it sounds like: A list of all the scenes in the script accompanied by a brief description of the events that transpire.
For purposes of this exercise, I have a slightly different take on scene. Here I am looking not just for individual scenes per se, but a scene or set of scenes that comprise one event or a continuous piece of action. Admittedly this is subjective and there is no right or wrong, the point is simply to break down the script into a series of parts which you then can use dig into the script’s structure and themes.
The value of this exercise:
* We pare down the story to its most constituent parts: Scenes.
* By doing this, we consciously explore the structure of the narrative.
* A scene-by-scene breakdown creates a foundation for even deeper analysis of the story.
This week: The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). You may download the script here.
Screenplay by Wes Anderson, story by Wes Anderson & Hugo Guinness, inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig
IMDb plot summary: The adventures of Gustave H, a legendary concierge at a famous hotel from the fictional Republic of Zubrowka between the first and second World Wars, and Zero Moustafa, the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend.
The Grand Budapest Hotel
Scene by Scene Breakdown
by Rob Hoskins
GoIntoTheStory.com
1–2: In present day, a girl enters Old Lutz Cemetery. She stops at a bust of ‘Author’, memorialized with hotel-room keys hanging on hooks. She holds a book, ‘The Grand Budapest Hotel’, with the Author’s face on the back cover. Twenty years prior, in his study, the same-aged author, begins the narration of the story.
2–6: The late sixties. The author describes how he came to take up rooms in the once-celebrated GBH, and laments its “present” state and descent into shabbiness. It is sparsely populated by a rather solitary group of vacationers, and overseen by the second-rate concierge M. Jean.
Introducing Mr. Moustafa. A figure projecting true loneliness. M. Jean provides an overview of his rags to riches story and the author is intrigued. The primer on Mr. Moustafa is interrupted as M. Jean sprints to action, to save a fat businessman from choking on his biscotti.
6–8: Fate intervenes, and the author and Mr. Moustafa meet in the hammam. Mr. Moustafa opens a polite conversation by stating his admiration for the author’s work. “How did you come to buy it… the Grand Budapest?”, the curious author inquires. Mr. Moustafa invites him to dine and to hear his story.
8: Mr. Moustafa commences the narration of the main story: ‘It begins of course with…’
Part 1: “M. Gustave”
9–16: M. Gustave, in his element, directing hotel staff in the service of guests. An elegant, well-oiled (and well-perfumed) machine. He sits with Madame C.V.D.u.T. (referred to in the script as “Madame D.”). It soon becomes apparent that M.G. is personally redefining “customer service”. He attempts to soothe her fearful intuition that they will never see each other again. They exchange “I love you”s, and he abruptly dispatches Madame D.’s driver to Lutz. As M. Gustave dictates to the lobby boy he suddenly realizes that he doesn’t know him.
16–19: Young Zero Moustafa’s interview begins. He has “zero” experience, education, or family, but impresses M.G. with a perfect answer to a deceptively tricky question.
19–20: Montage: Lobby Boy training begins. M. Gustave will be Zero’s counselor and guardian.
Zero performs the various and sundry tasks and duties of his position, anticipating the needs of the guests, with discretion as a guiding principle.
21–22: Zero begins to realize that, with respect to M. Gustave, “many of the guests came for him”, and that it “was also his pleasure.”
22–23: A day in the life, as Zero awakens in his tiny room and quickly grooms himself.Gustave sermonizes and recites from a small podium in the mess hall as the staff is served.
M.G. dines in a small room, nearly identical to Zero’s, but well-stocked with “L’air de Panache”.
23: Deputy Kovacs arrives to review the books with M. Gustave and business manager Herr Becker. Kovacs also conveys messages on behalf of the mysterious, unidentified owner of the GBH.
23–24: Introducing Agatha. Plain, graceful, seventeen years old, with a birthmark the shape of Mexico on the side of her face. She works a rolling pin in Mendl’s patisserie and has the air of a true artisan. She rides her bicycle through the town, a yoke bearing pink boxes balanced across her shoulders. Mr. Moustafa’s story ends abruptly: “ — but we won’t discuss that.”
Part 2: “Madame C.V.D.u.T.”
24–26: Carrying a stack of newspapers, Zero scans the headlines and comes to a stop. He dashes off to share the news with M. Gustave: Madame D. is dead. M.G.: “We must go to her.” He instructs Zero to pack quickly… and to bring a bottle of the Pouilly-Jouve ‘26.
26–31: As the train speeds toward Lutz, they sit in the first class cabin drinking chilled white wine. M.G. assesses the situation, particulary the disposition and motives of Madame D.’s family. He waxes philosophic, and rather bluntly discusses their physical intimacy.
The train comes to an abrupt halt in the middle of nowhere, and soldiers burst into their cabin. They ask them to produce papers, and briefly question Zero. M.G.’s charm offensive fails, and the soldiers sieze Zero against the protestations of his guardian. Cpt. Henckels arrives, having heard the commotion. He recognizes M. Gustave and apologizes, ordering his and Zero’s release. He gives Zero a temporary transit permit.
Gustave favorably notes the “faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity.”
31–34: They arrive in Lutz, at Madame D.’s mansion. Clotilde the maid attends to them.
Gustave surveys Madame D.’s corpse and expresses his admiration for her appearance. She has finally gotten in right… in death.
The butler M. Serge, via Clotilde, asks for a word with M.G. He and Zero wait for a moment for Serge, who is seen through the glass looking agitated and distraught.
34–39: M. Gustave impatiently marches into the Grand Hall, where relatives close and distant have gathered, their greed roused.
Kovacs enters and unceremoniously deposits onto a podium a large pile of documents that comprise Madame D.’s last will and testament. He sums up her intention as granting the bulk of the estate to Dimitri, her son, but then refers to an “additional codicil” recently received but not yet legally verified.
He reads the codicil: M. Gustave receives the priceless painting “Boy with Apple”.
Dimitri, outraged, confronts M.G., questioning both his intentions and his virility. A punchout, with the final blow struck by Dimitri’s muscle, Jopling.
39–42: M.G. goes to leave. Waiting again for the still agitated Serge, he piques Zero’s interest and they go to have a look at the painting. Zero suggests, first with his eyes, then by fetching a footstool, that possession is nine tenths of the law.
Serge wraps the painting for them, but not before surreptitiously inserting a letter marked “Confidential”. He remains cryptic, preferring to say no more. They depart for the train station.
42–44: In their train compartment at night, M. Gustave and Zero make a pact. They will sell “Boy with Apple”, with Zero to receive a commission, and then “lay low somewhere along the Maltese Riviera until the troubles blow over”. M.G. also bequeaths his belongings to Zero upon his death in exchange for Zero’s assistance.
44–45: Back at The Grand Budapest, they hide and lock up the painting. One of the bellboys advises that the police have arrived and are asking for M. Gustave. M.G. warns Zero to remain silent before the authorities. They announce his arrest. He acknowledges the murder, as if having suspected it, then suddenly bolts to escape. The policemen give chase.
Part 3: “Checkpoint 19 Criminal Internment Camp”
45–49: Zero visits M. Gustave, whose eyes are blackened. He has had to prove his virility to his new best friends.
Zero has spoken to Kovacs, who in flashback explains the theory of M.G.’s guilt to zero. Serge is revealed to have been the “witness” to M.G.’s illegal entry. Zero attempts to encourage M. Gustave and leaves him with a courtesan au chocolat from Mendl’s.
49–50: The dark, menacing Jopling visits the sister of Serge, looking for him. He continues his search by night, speeding through the city on his black motorcycle.
50–52: Zero reads a letter from M.G. to the staff, dictating his wishes and effectively managing the hotel from prison. Zero embodies the presence of M. Gustave, even taking the time to recite his tediously florid stanzas from the podium.
52–56: M. Gustave makes friends in prison, serving mush to a scar-faced giant, then sharing a beautiful, decadent Mendl’s pastry with Pinky and the gang. Ludwig sums up the physical challenges of an escape. They’ve found a possible way out, but need digging tools.
56: Returning to Mr. Moustafa, who cries as he recounts to the author the role Agatha played.
56–58: Zero and Agatha’s romance. He proposes, she accepts. He presents her with a gift of poetry.
58–59: M. Gustave interviews Agatha, ostensibly on Zero’s behalf. He playfully flirts with her and gives her gifts — a white porcelain pendant and five dozen white tulips — arousing Zero’s jealousy.
59–60: The equally brave and skilled Agatha hides digging tools in pastries so beautifully decorated that the “slice and dice” guard decides against damaging them with his cleaver.
60–62: Kovacs attempts to counsel Dimitri and family but they refuse his advice, uninterested in either the legal process or the intentions of the deceased. Jopling throws Kovacs’ cat out the window.
62: M. Gustave and the inmates are making progress, digging through the floor of their cell.
62–64: Zero sneaks into Agatha’s room and they share a couple’s moment together. He tells her of the stolen painting. She refuses to participate or even accept the note describing its location. He leaves it for her anyway.
64–66: Jopling rejoins his pursuit of Kovacs, following him to and through the darkened art museum. He slams shut an exit door, cutting off Kovacs’ escape route and his fingers, then delivers the death blow.
Later Herr Becker receives a message from the office of Kovacs, postponing their scheduled meeting indefinitely.
67–75: Zero arrives by bus to a dark, deserted roadside. He makes his way to an open area with a manhole, and seems to be waiting.
Lights out in the prison, and the inmates make their escape. M. Gustave’s large, scar-faced friend aides them by silencing a would-be whistle blower. One inmate loses his life as he assassinates three guards gathered around a card table.
They exit through the manhole, to the waiting Zero. M.G. introduces them all and begins to pontificate. The other three beat a hasty retreat to a waiting bus.
For his part, Zero has failed to secure a safe house, an escape route, and has even failed to bring the L’air de Panache. M.G. berates him, until Zero explains how he became a refugee. M.G. delivers a heartful apology on behalf of himself and the hotel, and reiterates to Zero and his affection for him. “We’re brothers”, says Zero.
Gustave makes a collect call to M. Ivan of…
Part 4: “The Society of the Crossed Keys”
76–78: The concierge fraternity jumps into action. A chain of phone calls. Each concierge drops what he is doing — whether giving directions, conducting a chorus of “Happy Birthday”, or administering emergency medical assistance — and delegates to his second in command. “Take over!”
78–81: M. Gustave assesses the situation and tries to make sense of it all, alongside a confused Zero. M. Ivan speeds into frame in his limo and spirits them away to the train station. The society has found Serge and a meeting with him has already been arranged. And M. Ivan has even brought the L’air de Panache.
81–83: Cpt. Henckels discovers their escape and gives “dragnet” instructions. Jopling also begins tracking them.
83–84: Dimitri orders Jopling to step up the aggression with Serge’s sister. He suddenly notices the obscene painting which has taken the place of “Boy with Apple”, and smashes it against a small marble statue.
84–86: M.G. puts Serge’s supposed betrayal in perspective. He expresses to Zero his admiration for Agatha and asks to officiate the wedding.
86–87: Alone in her room, Agatha packs. Hearing a noise, she sticks her head through the frame of the skylight. She sees nothing.
Henckels reads a headline “Young Girl’s Head Found in Laundry Basket”. The basket is brought to him. He reaches in and lifts out the head of Serge’s sister.
Part 5: “Gabelmeister’s Peak”
87–95: In the Alpine foothills, Jopling examines a bloodied document as a young attendant fuels up his motorcycle.
Soldiers catch the scent of L’air de Panache.
Zero and M. Gustave make for their high-altitude rendez-vous with Serge X. A monk instructs that they board the next cable car. Halfway up, another monk intercepts them and switches cable cars with the two, sending them off to the opposite peak. A third monk provides them with robes and bibles to join the choral assembly. The final monk send them to confess.
Serge sits opposite in the confessional box. He tells M.G. that there is a second will, and he has made a second copy. Suddenly his story is interrupted. He has been strangled by a now escaping Jopling.
95–99: As Jopling skis away, M.G. and Zero give chase by sled. They speed down the mountain, with Zero barely able to steer.
Jopling comes to the end of the run and watches as M. Gustave and Zero come barreling down, out of control, slamming into the snow bank at the bottom, then flying through the air. Zero lands head first in the snow, practically disappearing, and M. Gustave is nearly thrown off the edge of the cliff.
As M.G. dangles over the edge, Jopling fractures the ice with the heel of his boot. Graceful even in the face of death, M. Gustave’s poetic verses are rudely interrupted as Zero shoves Jopling off the mountain.
Henckels spots the fugitive and accomplice and warns them not to flee. They flee. Zero’s plan is to steal Jopling’s motorcycle, fetch Agatha, take back “Boy with Apple”, and head for the Maltese Riviera, once and for all. But first, a moment of silence for Serge.
99–109: Mr. Moustafa narrates: “The war began at midnight.” The lobby of the GBH is filled with fascists. It has become “a troops’ barracks”. “Z-Z” symbols are plastered everywhere.
Agatha makes a delivery of pink boxes for the soldiers as M. Chuck manages room logistics for his new guests.
Agatha, alone in the vault, follows Zero’s written instructions and retrieves the wrapped painting. Outside the hotel, M. Gustave and Zero observe from a Mendl’s truck. M.G. laments the state of the Grand Budapest under its new occupants. They watch with concern as Dimitri enters the hotel.
Agatha looks for an escape route, and bee-lines into the elevator, asking the operator for the top floor. Dimitri intercepts her and goes along for the ride, while she nervously avoids eye contact. He eyes the package she’s carrying and gingerly peels back the wrapping. “Boy with Apple”.
Gustave and Zero deliver another stack of pink pastry boxes courtesy of Herr Mendl. Dimitri follows Agatha off the elevator and she makes a break for it. He has lost her in the hallway. As M.G. and Zero step from the elevator Dimitri spots them and opens fire. A shootout ensues as soldiers step out from their rooms to enter the fray. Henckels calls for them to cease fire.
A scream. Agatha, and the painting, hang from the edge of the building. Zero leaps to save her, but overshoots and now dangles from the same railing. They are saved as they crash into the Mendl’s truck below.
She has noticed something on the back of the painting…
Part 6: “The Second Copy of the Second Will”
109–114: Madame D. left everything to M. Gustave: the mansion, the factories, a newspaper syndicate… and the GBH.
M.G. anoints Zero as his successor, the new concierge. He officiates the wedding of Zero and Agatha. Mr. Moustafa recounts how two years later Agatha and his infant son died from the ‘Prussian gripe’.
Zero and Agatha travel with M. Gustave by train toward Lutz. M.G. acknowledges his humble beginnings as a lobby boy, and that Zero finally surpassed him. Agatha recites a stanza about two brothers, “one from the east and one from the west”.
They are again stopped in the middle of nowhere by fascist thugs. This time they are not so lucky. The leader rips up Zero’s transit papers. M. Gustave steps up to defend him.
Back to 1965: Mr. Moustafa reveals that the soldiers shot him.
114–117: In summing up M. Gustave he echoes his mentor’s own words. “There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse once known as humanity. He was one of them.”
The author inquires hesitantly as to why Mr. Moustafa has traded a great fortune for this doomed hotel. He kept it for Agatha. Her crossed-keys pendant is pinned to his jacket.
The author sits alone writing in a small notebook.
“It was an enchanting old ruin, but I never managed to see it again.”
The author at seventy five sits alone writing in a small notebook.
Back to present day. The girl sits on a bench, finishing the final chapter of “The Grand Budapest Hotel”.

The most important thing I learned is that my Magyar definitely needs some work!
I also realized that I have accepted that certain cuisines are not globally popular for a good reason. I have disliked food from other countries but that was not the case in Hungary. I did not dislike it but I was not blown away with it either. Maybe I did not try all the right places but made an attempt based on TripAdvisor and Yelp reviews. When I travel with my son I prefer hotel rooms with Breakfast included because the little guy is not exactly the most patient toddler so that does remove one meal off any day.
That was the only thing about my trip that skews towards the disappointed side of a straight line so I started with it. Now lets move onto why Budapest is sooooo amazing because I loved generally everything else about it. I am writing this about a month after the trip but that is one memorable and beautiful city! If you have ever read about Budapest I am confident that the first thing you will read about is the attractiveness of the city. It’s like that pretty girl you can’t help but look more than once.
Ok so onto the trip, we stayed at the Budapest Marriott. It was an older looking hotel from the outside but the inside was great! If you enjoy views get a room with a view of the river. A disclaimer from me, I have a friend who got me a friends and family rate otherwise I probably would not have stayed at a non chain hotel because American chains are almost always more expensive than their local counterparts. The breakfast at the hotel tasted like Marriott food which means it was predictable but very good and expansive. Back to the view, awesome. My son featured in a great deal of pictures with it in the background and since I am an IPhone camera pro they obviously came out great and it was all my doing.
Moving on. The stuff I think I enjoyed the most with a young child was:
Budapest Castle,
walking down Andrassy Avenue to Heroe’s square,
the walk across the Chain bridge(or any bridge really across the Danube),
the city parks we stopped by,
There was also some spring festival type event going on at Vati Utca with music playing along with food and drink stalls that kept him occupied.
Finally my absolute favorite thing was Szechenyi baths and pools. So when you read on the internet you will get some confusing information about whether it is ok to take your children to the pools. Well here is the final word on that based on my personal experience so take it to the bank. If you kid is not a jerk you should be good to go! Here are the caveats because you knew they were coming. We only took the little guy into the HUGE pools. Basically here it is step by step, layman’s terms, if you will. You walk in and there are some counters where you buy tickets. It was packed when we went. They have a menu of options on these little flyers near those ticket counters in various languages so grab yours but regardless of what it says at minimum get a private cabin changing room. Quit being cheap. Its actually not crazy expensive but I think its the minimum for a basic level of comfort if you have a family. If your solo or with all adults maybe other options will work. The cabins are all over the damn place so an attendant will show you one and its basically a tiny little room you can change and store your stuff in. The storing stuff being important. Our umbrella stroller fit like a charm. The other thing is if your sharing cabins between people they are tiny so I would not recommend going in all at once. Anyways, once your ready you go through this huge complex which is all medicinal pools. We skipped all of those because they may or may not be good for a small toddler. When you get outside you’ll find the huge pools I mentioned. It was packed!! Heres the kicker…plenty of kids having a good time. Since you are in a crowded space you’ll probably want to keep the kiddos under control as not to disturb others but for the most part everyone seemed ok with it. If you want to check out the inside you can do what we did and go one by one while the other entertained. All in all great way to spend a day, experience something local, and entertain a rugrat. As if they knew what I was thinking I later saw in our hotel magazine(that one WHERE magazine thats in every room in every hotel, in every place ever), I seriously need to work for that company that sometimes they turn those polls into pool/club parties. EBC in Budapest if you will. I obviously didn’t attend but I would have. Ohhh, actually come to think of it we had a tough time finding a swim diaper for the little guy anywhere so we used the extra thick night diapers but were checking all the time to make sure he didn’t code brown or yellow so save some peace of mind and bring swim diapers!!
My other favorite thing was the hospital under the rock behind/under Budapest castle. This was a suggestion from my parents and what a cool if somewhat underfunded museum. Tickets were expensive but I think they had discounts for students or people who took the bus tour of the city. Incidentally, there seemed to be 3 big companies offering that tour. We took the red\yellow bus one and it was ok. It was just called the hop on\hop off tour. Bought the tickets at the hotel because they were the same price as the door which was surprising to me but they let me pay with my card so you know, points. The big bus tour company buses actually looked better to me from what I saw on the outside but since I did not experience it I can’t really say they are. Back to the museum, its all underground and basically they show you how they ran this intense hospital under the castle during war times. I usually get real yawny at museums but this one was cool if not depressing. One of those reflective, I am so glad to be born where and when I was born type moments(yay genetic lottery). My son happened to sleep through most of itso I don’t know how it would have been had be been awake but my guess is that it would have been fine since the space is tiny inside. Mostly would have had to keep him from touching everything.
Finally, we took a few Ubers to get to starting points but really your doing yourself an injustice if you don’t walk around everywhere. Quit being lazy.
Notes and recap:
Vati Utca — Its like a happening street with restaurants, shops, bars, etc. Touristy like any social area of any big city but if your reading this your probably a tourist.
Andrassy Avenue, think Rodeo Drive(not as expensive). Fancy shops, beautiful architecture, Mcdonalds, Burger King, and Starbucks. They also have the miniversum, this pretty cool tiny train museum which would be better if you could interact more with the trains rather than just watch them but from their perspective it would probably get destroyed really fast if they let that happen so never mind what I have to say. If you have kids they may enjoy checking it out. The play area in the back with some barely working trains was great for a toddler though. We sat there for 2 hours at least while the little guy went to town. My croc water sandal fell out of the stroller at the miniversum so if anyone finds it let me know!
Faust Winery — Found this place on tripadvisor. Like the hospital it is underground in a cavernous space under Budapest castle very close to the Hilton nearby. Really cool wine tasting experience. The couple that was running it were super friendly and seemed informed, not that I could have told you if they were not. I just tend to nod my head when someone asks if I am getting the fruity notes. I do like wine though so we tasted some really great local stuff. It was 20 bucks a head for 6 tastings and solid pours. A really cool date place from the look of it in case you happen to have a date in Budapest is my favorite way of describing it, plus a good chance the other person winds up a little buzzed so you will be more interesting without even trying! My one advice because its a real cool setting and you don’t want to be the people with children running around in there try to plan your tasting around a nap time. Its super chilly and dark in there so my little guy slept great in his stroller.
Tokaji — We did not actually go to the wine region because its a long car trip but totally doable for adults from what I could gather. Unreasonable with a little one so we did the next best thing. We bought and tasted a bunch. Tokaji is a sometimes sweet white wine that is delicious if you like that sort of thing. I do. The Mrs., not so much but since its my blog and not hers I think you should drink up as much as you can. They have a rating scale for them which obviously effects costs so you can read up on that if your interested. We tried a few at the Faust cellars mentioned above so maybe ask them what to get. Hungarian Wine ftw!
Thats all I have for now but any questions let me know and I can try to help. This was a on the surface first trip for me and I hope I get to make it back to explore more and maybe make it out to wine region. We had a blast in Mendoza, Argentina and honestly liked it better than Napa so I am always game for new regions revolving around booze.
I am a new writer but am enjoying it so far. People often ask me for travel advice so thought I would just make it public. Hopefully its simplified enough that the work is just done for you. That is the goal at least. I am sure it will be a work in progress. I will also post them to my blog at www.jaideeps.com. Sign up, I have some other topics too that I enjoy writing about especially as I learn more about them. Hope of one of them makes life easier for you!

People always ask me for travel advice since I travel frequently for leisure. Never wrote it down before! Beyond that I also write about anything I’m working on

Wes Anderson’s picture book masterpiece for the ages
Last Saturday I revisited the unloved Christopher Nolan masterpiece The Prestige and last night, with the now inevitable drawing in of the heatwave summer nights, I continued with an aged custom of my “Saturday Night Film Club” and treated myself to another trip to The Grand Budapest Hotel. As you will gather if you read the entirety of the opus blog article I’ve gratuitously plugged and linked to the end of this opening paragraph, I’m rather in love with the films of Wes Anderson and my love-in articles on Isle of Dogs (2018) and The French Dispatch (2021) can also be found deep within my film archives.
No great revelations here. No deep dive into the merits of a masterpiece that only time and an open consciousness will appreciate.
Just oodles of love for a cinematic masterpiece and a gratuitous plug for a film article I wrote many years ago?
As the inhabitants of the Coen Brothers film Fargo would say
“You Betcha!”
medium.com
“I’m afraid that’s me darling!”
I consider myself very fortunate to see Wes Anderson’s eighth film just after opening night at my local picture house and instantly fell in love with it. For personal reasons only I rank it second in my all time personal favourite films of his but sixteen years after Rushmore it truly runs it close for my all time favourite. The Grand Budapest Hotel is far more elegant, poetic and picturesque than Rushmore and I adore the comic book/picture book feel of the film. It’s timeless flow and imagination makes an instant re-watching an easy decision, especially when you consider the film itself is almost a film within a film, within a film. The three separate time periods of 1985, 1968 and 1932 flow together seamlessly and whilst the film may be predominantly set in the 1930’s the movements forward in time are never jarring or awkward and simply add to the majesty of this wonderful film. As I write this ode to joy on 1st October 2014 the Oscar buzz has not yet started but surely this is the breakthrough film of Oscar recognition Wes Anderson has thoroughly deserved since the eponymous Rushmore sixteen long years ago. Whilst Oscars are not the yardstick by which to measure a film’s success, we can but hope.
The film is inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig (who is thanked in the closing credits) but Anderson and fellow writer Hugo Guinness deserve an Oscar nomination for their surreal screenplay and for the poetic, dancing dialogue given to Ralph Fiennes and Jeff Goldblum, both of whom pull of their linguistic treats to perfection but more of this later. Robert Yeoman’s cinematography is again inspired, adding to the picture book texture of the film and combined with Adam Stockhausen’s production design and miniature models provide so many endearing and effective cinematic shots that deserve Oscar recognition in 2015 but the same can be said for Milena Canonero’s wonderful array of costumes that truly are a centre piece of the film, Anna Pinnock’s set decoration and Stephen Gessler’s art direction are all worthy of recognition and in Oscar circles, if it’s The Grand Budapest’s year in 2015, all will be worthy recipients of the prized statue. The film is such an incredible achievement Wes Anderson’s entire behind the scenes crew deserve special praise for realising an astonishing looking film that enchants you with every watch, but a final nod goes to Film Editor Barney Pilling for weaving together three differing timelines, so many narrative strands and of course, the long held Wes Anderson trademarks which proliferate the film and work so wonderfully well as ever.
In front of the camera is a real ensemble cast of returning actors from previous Anderson films or A-List first timers that each portray highly original character creations that I will briefly appraise below. But to whet your appetite we have, in no particular order: a dastardly double dealing Frenchman, a vicious German enforcer, a spurned son, a pompous writer, a heavily tattooed yet loquacious prison inmate, an equally loquacious lawyer, a bizarre local Captain of the Military, a beautiful pastry chef, several surreal concierges, one strident, wistful, foul mouthed yet sweet tongued lothario who also occasionally acts as a concierge, oh, and a Lobby Boy named Zero! All of whom are in the very capable hands of Ralph Fiennes, Adrien Brody, Bill Murray, F Murray Abraham, Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Mathieu Amalric, Edward Norton, Jude Law, Saoirse Ronan, Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson, Tony Revolori, and returning favourites Owen Wilson and Jason Schwartzman.
The opening frame of the film sets the tone and immediately you’re aware this is a Wes Anderson film. All three time periods of 1985, 1968 and 1932 were shot in different aspect ratios to suitably reflect the change in period so don’t adjust your set! The film has a continuing narration throughout however the narrator changes with the time period and firstly in 1985 we have the bizarre spectacle of “Author” (Tom Wilkinson) narrating direct to camera whilst being shot at by his son with an air gun!. We now jump back to 1968 and the second of our narrators “Young Writer” (Jude Law) who details the demise of the once opulent and highly regarded Grand Budapest Hotel, located in Zubrowka, a fictional European town high in the hills and formerly a hive of activity that attracted only the very wealthy prior to the outbreak of war in the 1930’s. But here in 1968 it is now rather decrepit and a monument to a bygone age but which still retains it character and remnants of it’s more luxurious past and now houses singular visitors who keep themselves to themselves whilst passing through. The Young Writer is wont to stand “elbow to elbow” of an evening with “M.Jean” (Jason Schwartzman) the hotel’s current incumbent in the role of concierge and the returning Schwartzman is excellently bizarre in a small cameo role. M.Jean alerts the young writer to the exception to the visitors who pass nominally through the hotel, “Mr Moustafa” (F Murray Abraham) the current owner of the hotel, and through “fate” the young writer is able to ask the scene setting question to Mr Moustafa of how he came to own such a grand building with such grand history and with such a grand tale to tell? The particular tale Mr Moustafa tells is of intrigue, suspense, murder, philandering and of colourful characters in very colourful and bizarre circumstances. It’s also a tale of young love, a Lobby Boy named Zero and a loquacious concierge who came to own the priceless painting of “Boy With Apple” and the story is told, indeed narrated, over an evening meal between the two men as they dine in the huge, imposing dining hall of the Grand Budapest Hotel.
Wes Anderson’s masterpiece is split into five parts (each with it’s own title slide naturally) and are occasionally preceded by a slight change in the colour palette of the film. All Anderson hallmarks are present and correct: overhead shots, extreme close ups on books, paintings, newspapers, sepia tinged photographs, together with beautiful rolling camera shots, surreal inserts (look out for the cloakroom ticket!), plus there’s the obligatory “man hanging out of a window” shot that has appeared in nearly all of his films. The picture book style of the film is an absolute joy, the narrative blending with the bizarre character creations perfectly and every frame has been meticulously planned to the nth degree. But what impresses me time and time again in Anderson’s eight cinematic offering are the small segments of scenes not seen in his previous works. The multi doors sweeping open as we approach the reading of the will and “Zero” (Tony Revolori) about to commence the obligatory reading of the concierge letter and poem before the staff’s evening meal but an instant cutaway to an imprisoned “M.Gustave” (Ralph Fiennes) and his surreal reading of the letter whilst surrounded by unemotional fellow inmates and prison officers are two examples of many. The chase in the Kunstmuseum is just phenomenal and a credit to the genius Director of Photography Robert Yeoman, as is the prison escape sequence and only surpassed by the acting and prose delivered by Tony Revolori and Ralph Fiennes at it’s touching, yet amusing denouement.
These are but minor examples of so many brilliant scenes devised and shot through the prism of Messrs Anderson and Yeoman lens but even these are topped by a Wes Anderson staple, but with a twist! The film’s touching love story centres on Zero and the beautiful “Agatha” (Saoirse Ronan) and during their early courtship they enjoy a merry-go-round ride that is simply shot and ended with an Anderson hallmark of a straight on extreme close up on Agatha but rather than an unemotional shot (as is the norm) she is bright eyed and smiling. All five parts or acts of the film are an absolute joy, and here’s a very brief dissection of a very colourful cast of characters:
“M.Gustave” (Ralph Fiennes) Busy yet meticulous concierge of The Grand Budapest Hotel in the 1930’s who has a penchant for fine wine, blonde haired older ladies and L’air de Penache’. Has a wonderful linguistic use of English and a lothario who calls everyone, regardless of sex, as “darling”.
A stellar performance worthy of a 2015 Oscar.
“Zero” (Tony Revolori) Zero experience and zero family and friends. Deeply in love with his beloved Agatha but don’t you dare flirt with her! Following numerous roles in TV and short films, this is Tony’s first major role and many more are sure to follow this accomplished performance.
“Young Writer” (Jude Law) Well spoken writer, English Gentleman, European traveller and one of the film’s numerous narrators who’s told an incredible tale in an incredible dining room in an incredible film.
A cameo yet important role from Law.
“Mr Moustafa” (F Murray Abraham) Quiet and unassuming owner of The Grand Budapest Hotel who remains utterly devoted to Agatha, deeply misses his “Agatha” and has an intriguing tale to tell. It maybe a cameo role but it’s F Murray Abraham — what else do you need to know?
“Agatha” (Saoirse Ronan) Owner of Zero’s heart, saviour and bravest of the film’s eclectic and surreal cast of characters and she’s far more than a mere “pastry chef”. Atonement, The Lovely Bones and now The Grand Budapest Hotel, Ronan’s star is on the rise and justifiably so.
“Henckels” (Edward Norton) Surreal Captain of the Local Military who is big on moustaches, quizzical looks and very definitely not “Little Albert” anymore! A priceless cameo from the ever dependable Edward Norton.
“Nobody move. Everybody’s under arrest!”.
“Ludwig” (Harvey Keitel) Heavily tattooed prison inmate who can see the vulnerability of their “flophouse” and impresses M.Gustave with his artistic talents. Only included here as he’s a cherished actor I greatly admire and can drive any distance in just nine minutes and thirty seven seconds!
“Deputy Kovacs” (Jeff Goldblum) An eloquent, elegant and operatic cameo from a deadpan and utterly brilliant Goldblum as a conflicted but straight as a die lawyer. But please, don’t mention his cat!
“Dmitri” (Adrien Brody) Angry, very, very angry spurned son of a wealthy departed blonde lady who’s missing a priceless painting. As eloquent as his fellow characters but with a rather more foul mouth than the rest, even in front of his sisters! Yet another superb performance from Brody in an Anderson film.
“Jopling” (Willem Dafoe) Ruthless family enforcer who is also a remarkably accomplished motorbike rider and Olympic skier! An almost wordless performance but there’s nothing quiet or subtle about Jopling’s methods of disposal. Another returnee to an Anderson film and another accomplished and important cameo from Dafoe.
Supporting these premier roles are many more fleeting and cameo roles from Mathieu Amalric as a strangely staring French concierge “Serge X”, Bill Murray as the ever helpful “M.Ivan”, Jason Schwartzman as the comical concierge “M.Jean”, Tilda Swinton as the ill fated and fabulously wealthy “Madame D”, Owen Wilson as concierge “M.Chuck”, Florian Lukas as “Pinky”, Karl Markovics from the utterly brilliant and highly recommended film of 2007 The Counterfeiters as “Wolf”, a returning Bob Balaban as “M.Martin” and fellow returnees to a Wes Anderson film of Wallace Wolodarsky as concierge “M.George” and Waris Ahluwalia as concierge “M.Dino”.
A truly stellar ensemble cast in a wonderfully spellbinding film that showcases the very best in the Director of this magnum opus of a love in, Wes Anderson. I cannot recommend his films enough and The Grand Budapest may be his best yet and come 2015, hopefully he will receive further Oscar recognition to go with this particular film fan’s total admiration for his vision and desire to produce visually stunning pieces of cinematic art.

While writing and researching in Budapest last year, we ate a couple of times at a local restaurant that takes enormous pride in its food and service (Kispiac) and went there for our last evening meal before leaving Budapest.
The owner asked us about our time in Budapest and whether we’d like to return. Before we left, he came out with a bottle of Hungarian sparkling tokaji as a going away gift. Whilst Hungarians are rarely effusive, we found them helpful and generous — I can’t imagine that kind of gesture from a London restaurant after a couple of visits.
Budapest is an extraordinary place — there’s a quiet kindness in so many people — unshowy, but vital. There’s also deep melancholy — a history replete with suffering and ongoing political corruption and extremism.
It’s a place where beautiful Art Nouveau buildings are sometimes fading and uncared for. There are architectural gems are so in need of restoration that chunks of masonry fall into the street (we saw two passers-by almost felled by falling stone). And yet there’s also pride in good service and good food, in art and architecture, in being humane.
When I arrived, one of the themes in my novel was the debate over whether Attila József committed suicide or died in a tragic accident. The preponderance of opinion has always been that his death was by suicide, but I wanted to leave the question open, to stay with the ambiguity.
A conversation with László Kúnos of Corvina Press convinced me otherwise. Sad as it is to believe that this exceptional man chose to kill himself, the more I read the poetry and biographies, the more I realised that there is an internal logic to the life and death.
This is a scene when I’ve explored this in the novel:
She walks back slowly. She will go to the place where he wrote when editing the magazine, Beautiful Word, another day, but the statue on the Danube near the Parliament building is only a short detour on the route to her apartment.
József sits, coat thrown down beside him, hat in his hand, watching the river, the epitome of contemplation and lament. He looks as though he’d spent the day walking across this city searching for something, Catherine thinks. The lines from ‘By the Danube’ are in a facsimile of József’s handwriting: Mintha szivembôl folyt volna tova Zavaros, bölcs és nagy volt a Duna — As if it flowed straight from my heart / Troubled, wise and great was the Danube.
How was it that Székely translated those lines? Catherine asks the statue.
As if my own heart had opened its gate:
The Danube was turbulent, wise and great.
She thinks of the conversation with Margit and András, how a thing mutates between languages, but even in one language how every action, every nuance is open to interpretation.
Catherine sits on the bottom step beneath Attila, looking towards the Danube with him. When she begins to feel stiff and colder she walks towards the figure, touches his hand.
There is such melancholy here, she tells him. Suicide seems to be everywhere, your language is unlike any neighbouring country’s, your borders have changed, to say there has been one too many invasion is an understatement and even your national anthem talks of pity and sorrow. So much sadness and I have endless questions for you that you can’t answer. Did you kill yourself? I’m minded to agree with Margit and András that you did. Why didn’t you take another route? And the strangest question of all — Did you know a woman called Selene Solweig Virág?
At the Attila József Museum, I was further convinced that the poet took his own life. We took a tram to the south of the city to the IXth District. It was the most run-down area we visited and a shock after the picturesque tram-ride along the Danube. It was a blazing hot day and we were glad to find that museum after only ten minutes walking.
When we found the museum there seemed to be no way in, but after a rather halting phone call a curator let us in. We weren’t charged the entrance fee and had the museum to ourselves for two hours. The curator was helpful and delighted to have visitors. All this investment and care and no-one there.
The place was beautifully presented, tiny yet brimming with photos, artefacts and interactive displays. There are first edition copies of his collections, the pencil he wrote with, notebooks, letters and a copy of his birth certificate.
Attila could fall in love in minutes and does so with my character, Selene, who never appears in the histories or photographs as she is not from the same time as Attila. She may be imagining her relationship with him during the trauma of her imprisonment after the 1956 Uprising. Or perhaps not? Either way, she fits the pattern of József’s often unrequited and always difficult love life.
Ah, Catherine? the curator asks. I am with you.
Márta Tákacs appears moments later and Catherine holds out her hand to shake. They walk through a small courtyard and into the ground floor two-roomed apartment, Marta tall and elegant, her fair hair held behind a blue band that matches her eyes.
People come from everywhere, Márta says as they enter.
The walls are covered in black and white photographs. Catherine notes the picture of József’s father in military uniform that she has a copy of and one of his mother that she has not seen previously. Borbála is young and pretty, with soft features. Another image shows a house further along the street where the family lived when József was a toddler — It says: Papa disappeared from this flat, Márta says, translating legend.
By the door a map shows another nineteen apartments that the family lived in after Attila ran back to his mother from the foster family at Öcsöd, who set him to work as a five-year-old swineherd.
They were constantly thrown out for not being able to pay the rent, Márta tells her. Attila was lucky that later his brother-in-law paid for his education so he didn’t have to go on sell newspapers for a living. In his childhood, he’d already known work — collecting coal, selling paper whirligigs that he made from scraps to better-off children. In the war he’d queue all night to buy food for the family, only to find that the cooking lard had run out and there was nothing to be had by eight in the morning. He was only fourteen when his mother died and Makai sent him to the Makó boarding school. They tried to send him to a seminary too, but he left after a week, telling them he was Orthodox, not Catholic. He got good grades at school, but he was already suffering with depression and tried to kill himself when he was only sixteen. I will leave you to look, she says finally, but I’m in the next room if you have questions.
There are copies of József’s poetry collections on a small table, beginning with Szépség koldusa, Beauty’s Beggar, written when he was seventeen. Catherine lingers over each picture, each book, but feels no sense of Attila in the rooms.
After a while Márta reappears with a set of pictures. These were his women, she says. This one was the daughter of the director of his boarding school — Márta Gebe. He was very young, but she inspired several poems. Then Maria Esprit, this time his landlord’s daughter. And this one is most interesting.
The black and white picture is of a beautiful girl, aquiline features, large eyes, her close-cut bobbed hair under a fashionable cap.
Luca Wallennsz was the daughter of Gitta Genes, a very fine artist and ceramicist. There are beautiful works in the National Gallery. Her husband wrote novels and poetry. Very refined Jewish family. They gave salons and many famous names were there, but Gitta met Attila first in the park. He sat next to her on a bench and declared his love five minutes later. He was only nineteen and she was a mature woman, beautiful, but thirty-six. They became close — not what we would call an affair, but a relationship still. He wrote poems for her, of course, like ‘It was summertime’ and then her daughter, Luca, became interested in the salons and Attila fell in love once more. He wrote her many excellent poems, mostly in ’28. Very beautiful — ‘I bless you with sadness and happiness’ is best known of them, set to music often.
He fell in love often, Catherine notes.
Indeed. And he loved Gitta and Luca at the same time too.
Ah, Catherine says, thinking of Attila loving Flóra and Selene simultaneously.
You will know this one, of course.
Catherine holds the picture of Márta Vágó. Yes. The first serious love of his life, perhaps.
Márta nods. They wrote every day when she first went to London, but the distance was too much to sustain. I think that’s what her parents hoped for. They were wealthy intelligentsia, he was the son of a soap factory worker and a peasant, after all. Márta pauses. And this one –
She hands Catherine an image of Judit Szánto.
I always think the most sad, Márta finishes. She lived with him six years, tried to make a place of security for him. He was very broken after the relationship with Márta Vágó ended. But he said it was ‘not love, but an alliance’. Particularly harsh from a man who loved easily. He wrote one poem, ‘Judit’ and a few scraps that never became poems, that was all. While he was with Judit he met Edit.
Márta hands her the photograph of Edit Gyömrői. She was his doctor and he became … she searches for the word … fixated on her so that another doctor, Robert Bak, had to take over.
And then one day he saw this girl, Márta Márton –
Catherine studies the beautiful young face.
He didn’t know her. He saw her and decided he was in love. He wrote the poem ‘Ode’ for her, an exquisite love poem, and when Judit realised that she was not the muse of this poem, she tried to kill herself. They’d already tried to part earlier, but broke apart after this.
An finally –
The last picture is of Flóra Kozmutza. No picture of Selene, Catherine thinks.
They met at Anna Daniels apartment in February ’37 and were engaged by April, but it was never to be of course.
Catherine nods. Thank you. They’re all so beautiful.
Yes, lovely but sad, Márta adds.
After our final dinner at Kispiac, we walked to the Danube, sat by Attila’s statue and read some of his poetry, including ’By the Danube’.
I very much hoped it would be ‘au revoir’, and not goodbye. And I’m now looking forward to launching the novel in Budapest in November, at the wonderful Massolit bookshop and cafe.
By the Danube.
1.
As I sat on the bottom step of the wharf,
A melon-rind flowed by with the current;
Wrapped in my fate I hardly heard the chatter
Of the surface, while the deep was silent.
As if my own heart had opened its gate:
The Danube was turbulent, wise and great. …

First thing’s first, what’s your name and how old are you?
Julia, 31 years old.
And what do you do, workwise?
Director of Sales at Craft Travel Group.
What was it that attracted you to Nomad House (or coliving in general)?
The chance to visit Budapest and experience a co-living retreat.
Where were you before joining?
All over! In between Miami (my “home”), Madrid, New York and Rio de Janeiro…but I came to Budapest after 3 weeks in Barcelona/Madrid
What advice have you found most helpful, since beginning to travel and work remotely?
Try to establish some sort of routine. Find one place you can work from where you know internet will be good and you’ll have limited distractions. Find one other person who is also looking to get shit done and partner up with them. If you are like me and get distracted by just about anything, you’ll need to try extra hard while traveling to be productive because there is ALWAYS something going on.
Which lessons will you be taking from Nomad House?
So many! First off, it’s amazing how many different people I met from all over with all different interests. I would have never met these people under other circumstances and I’m SO glad I did. I learned so much on both a personal and professional level by living and traveling with this talented, diverse group of like-minded wanderlusters. So I suppose the main lesson would be to always be open-minded and take risks. I signed up to NH Budapest without any idea as to what I was getting into. But it ended up being one of the best weeks of my life.
How has Nomad House shaped your future?
Being around people with so many different professional backgrounds and talents really helped me identify my own strengths and learn from theirs. For example, in talking so much about different ideas and projects I discovered during the retreat that I was much more creative and that I have more entrepreneurial qualities than I thought previously. And by learning about others’ backgrounds I could identify the skills that I definitely DON’T have and understand them a bit better so I would know what/who to look for when pursuing future projects.
How do you feel about this lifestyle now — how do you think it will grow, and will you be trying more coliving programs in the future?
100% more convinced that my life will always involve some mix of co-living/retreat/nomadic activity for the foreseable future. :)
And a quickfire round…
Describe your gear setup [what do you take with you, your essential ‘in kit’ items]
Protein bars- they are my travel must-have because nobody wants to see me cranky. Also sneakers and headphones so I can go running or workout anywhere. And some sleeping pills for those long flights.
Describe your essential apps.
WhatsApp, RunKeeper, American Airlines (I’m obsessive about my Executive Platinum status), Splitwise (discovered during NH Budapest), and of course Tinder. :)
Describe your travel stack [your preferred websites for booking travel].
Kayak, Skyscanner, AA.com
Where can people get in touch with you?
Instagram @julia.crafted, or Craft’s website.

Let me start with the obvious; the colour grading is so unique in its pastel flavours whilst the cinematography is so very peculiar it is almost impossible for these 2 productions to be anything other than engaging, however, even more than this, it is the premise of these 2 films that make them so immensely beautiful to watch. Let me explain.
What truly makes Moonrise kingdom and Grand Budapest Hotel so interesting, engaging and unique is the fact that their storylines are based on delving into the real grit of people with life choices and occupations that we simply don’t think about. Anderson manages to turn what appear like random, uninteresting occupations such as Khaki Scouts and Hotel Bell Boy’s into the premise of his films, and he makes them look so exceptionally interesting.
By the end of the films, you truly believe that it would be exciting and thrilling to be the bell boy of a prestigious yet almost chaotic hotel, or a member of a scout group so regimental it makes school look like an atrocity. By giving small, seemingly unimportant jobs a real and professional status, it allows us as the audience to understand what it must feel like to belong to a group who take even the lightest job as a strict routine that must be followed. That has power.
As a viewer, it makes me wish I had as much passion and discipline as to carry out my job in the way Anderson manages to portray the characters within his film. And that’s what film is all about; allowing the viewer to escape to a reality that they cannot possibly escape to in real life. Without Moonrise Kingdom and The Grand Budapest Hotel, I would not have given hotel staff or scout groups a second thought, and now, I see their lives and their stories as so interesting and different, I can’t help but think of an alternative reality whereby I venture into these professions; but hey, maybe I’ve been watching too much Rick and Morty.

Budapest is in the top 3 best European cities where to party.
Just ask the countless bachelors bringing all their friends over from London for a wild weekend. Or the Erasmus students going crazy on a regular Monday night. Or basically, any young people living in Budapest.
The reason: lots of cool bars + cheap alcohol.
Out of these bars, many of them are ruin pubs, run-down places that emerged from the ruins of ancient buildings and are now one of the most iconic symbols of Budapest.
I am Portuguese but I lived in Budapest for 3.5 years. Pandemic times aside, I explored the nightlife of my beloved home away from home, always arriving home at the end of the night with the same feeling “This is the coolest city in Europe”.
So here are my recommendations for anyone wanting to explore the best bars in Budapest!
The first and most iconic ruin bar of Budapest. Going to Budapest and not visiting Szimpla is like going to Rome and not seeing the Pope. If going out is not your thing, try it during the day, when it’s quiet and you can simply admire the place, or on Sunday morning, when the place hosts a Farmers…

“Is it Paris or is it communist Russia? Who knows?!” Colin Hanks
These days, thanks to lower wages and a lower cost of living — and studio heads’ need for more money — there’s a lot of Hollywood production in Hungary. On any given night, some celebrity or muckety-muck can be found sipping palinka at the Four Seasons Hotel bar or wandering along the Danube. I’m here because my husband is working on a television show, our apartment’s Apple TV still has Eddie Redmayne’s login info and I know what Colin Hanks said about Budapest because my friend ran into him here, he was nice, they chatted, he described this place perfectly.
The comparison to Paris is obvious: classic pre-war buildings on either side of a glorious river spanned by majestic bridges. Communism lingers in the depressing grey concrete buildings shoved between old elegant ones and the unsmiling faces seen on the street.
But when I heard this quote, my first thought wasn’t architecture or national character, it was bread. Budapest’s bread and pastries are — for real — better than bread and pastries in Paris.
I swear. But just in case my taste buds or memory had gone awry, I went to Paris to test my hypothesis. Any excuse to mow down more flour, sugar and butter than any…

Our two heroes, concierge extraordinaire Monsieur Gustav H (Ralph Finnes) and his lobby boy protégé Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori), sit across the table from each other in a moving railcar headed to the memorial of the tragically deceased Dowager Countess Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton). The mysterious old woman, a close friend (and frequent lover) of M. Gustav, had feared her death was imminent just three months prior, though specifically what she knew remains unclear. In her wake, the vultures are coming, ready to pick apart her financial corpse and no leave aspect of her estate unclaimed. Gustav, however, comes as a dove wishing to pay respect to the woman and ensure that she is as beautiful in death as she was in during her last stay at the Grand Budapest Hotel in Zubrowka. But before they reach their destination the train comes to an abrupt stop in a barley field, invaded by Zig Zag Stormtroopers looking for undesirables which, it seems, includes Zero. It takes Gustav both his tenacity and his previous kindness to the mother of the Zig Zag commander to earn protection for the young refugee. A woman is dead, and Europe seems to be following.
In 1914, Gavrilo Princip’s bullets struck Austria-Hungary’s Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie. They would die together as their car sped away on the streets of Sarajevo, the first domino in a long chain to fall that would lead to The Great War, ending true monarchy in Europe in just four years’ time, and shattering the continent’s economy and stability in the process. The rise of fascism that followed, in hindsight, seems inevitable. By 1945, the Second World War would be fought on many of the same battlefields, an attempt to push back against the totalitarian evils of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, and while the Allied resistance would ultimately win it came at a grave cost — before the midpoint of the twentieth century, Eastern European culture as we knew it was destroyed, replaced with a brutalist architecture and new forms of totalitarianism in the form of Soviet expansion.
When Wes Anderson’s 2014 masterpiece The Grand Budapest Hotel begins, we are not with Gustav at the grand chateau atop the mountain, but in a cemetery after the aforementioned Soviet Union itself has fallen. A young girl has come to visit the grave of a renowned Author (only known as such, played by the great Tom Wilkinson). She greatly admires a book of his and starts to read at the gravesite, one that was written in 1985 about a time in 1968 when he himself visited the titular hotel after its character and history were stripped in favor of the aesthetic du jour in Eastern Europe. No longer does the exterior resemble the pink majesty on the film’s poster, nor does the interior suggest an opulence reserved for royalty. Even the film’s aspect ratio has changed, from a small letterbox to a widescreen vantage like many of the historical epics being made at the time, only serving to contrast the drab and dreary nature of the establishment. The closest thing to culture or opulence we can spot is a painting of a boy holding an apple at the concierge desk.
It is at the hotel that the Author, now portrayed by Jude Law, spies an older gentleman (F. Murray Abraham) sitting patiently for no one in the lobby. When the author inquires about him, all he is told is that the man is the owner of the hotel and that he only stays once or twice a year, and even then, refuses to stay anywhere but a small room with a cot. The two meet in the baths (covered with grimy tile rather than elegant marble) and agree to join each other for dinner. It is there, in a large and empty dining hall, that the old man decides to tell the story of his time as a young lobby boy named Zero, his mentorship under the tutelage of the incredible and indelible Gustav H, and how the hotel came to be in his name.
As we see his story we realize how truly great the Grand Budapest Hotel once was, with its raised balconies, elegant carpentry, vaulted staircases, and chandeliers galore. The clientele is comprised of the world’s upper crust, coming from far and wide to experience the best Zubrowka has to offer, and the staff make it their mission to ensure they get it. The film is now in the nearly-square Academy ratio (again, like the films of its time), turning the wide realism into a jewel box we can’t help but admire. But underneath the majesty is an obvious melancholy, that throughout this fictional tale of excitement and adventure, prison breaks and murder, we are also seeing what we lost when Europe set itself on fire.
Let’s forget, for a second, that the sovereign nation of Zubrowka and the Zig Zag forces are entirely fictional and, instead, recognize the real-world counterparts they represent — Eastern Europe and Nazi Germany, respectively. When most of us today think of the latter we, correctly, picture a fascist, totalitarian, and extremely oppressive regime responsible for the decimation and destruction of numerous minority communities throughout the continent, most notably Jews and Romani. When we think of the former, however, we usually picture a more run-down, war-torn part of the world replete with brutalist architecture, grey skies, and impoverished citizens (like the hotel of the ‘60s). It has been the butt of many jokes throughout Western pop culture, my personal favorite being the incredibly exaggerated Bratislava sequence in 2004’s Eurotrip. It is important to remember, though, that this idea we have of a large swath of Europe is only part of the story and a small one at that. The current state of Eastern Europe is a direct aftermath of two global wars, along with further Soviet occupation and smaller conflicts in places like Bosnia and, most recently, Ukraine. One of the great tragedies of our time, and the main one The Grand Budapest is grappling with, is how much of that region’s culture has been lost, bulldozed, and forgotten in the wake of conflagration.
World War I was a knotty, complicated conflict with no clear good or bad guys to pick from (though much of the allied West was keen to point the finger at Germany and their Kaiser, who they already hated anyway). With two bullets fired from a young man’s gun and the month of confusion that immediately followed, all of Europe’s longstanding treaties and agreements, the same ones that had prevented full-scale continental war throughout a perilous and tumultuous nineteenth century, drove every nation in the area into hell. Young men were enlisted on the promise of national pride only to be used as machine gun fodder in the unmoving trenches in Belgium. Others were sent to Arabia in an attempt to push back the already sickly Ottoman Empire not to liberate the locals but to create desert empires of their own. By the time America was dragged in to help the English and French secure victory from the face of otherwise sure stalemate, all of Europe’s true monarchies had fallen and every nation had, on some level, lost. It was supposed to be “the war to end all wars”, but the emotional crater it left was the perfect cauldron to breed hatred and resentment, and the inevitable power struggle commenced.
Smartly, Grand Budapest is primarily set in 1932, nearly smack dab in between the two world wars. The imagery in the costume and production design is most obviously that of the second, but I believe that much of the early story is actually referencing the first. In that war, despite the hellish destruction, there was a pretend air of dignity attached. When Gustav and Zero are first accosted near a barley field the decorum and history between the commander and the concierge allows for safe passage (presumably in both directions). But when they arrive at the estate it is immediately clear that something is amiss, and the staff is ushering our two heroes away for a private discussion.
What is taking place, as we will soon learn, is a quick reading of the dowager countess’s will, which leaves the bulk of her estate to her ungrateful children — all except the painting “Boy with Apple”, which has been bequeathed to a one M. Gustav H. Much like Europe in the wake of WWI, unhappy with whatever lot they were left with, so, too, is Céline’s son and chief heir, Dmitri (Adrian Brody). Not only is he furious that he wouldn’t receive the entire estate in full, but that even a sliver of it should go to a man far below his station (and, adding insult to injury, the man she was having a lurid affair with). The rest of the film is, essentially, the remnants of the old-world empires grasping at every ounce of power they can and refusing to allow anyone from a lower class to have even a sliver. All Gustav wants is the painting, and many will die in Dmitri’s attempt to get it back.
By compressing the larger time period into a short year, Anderson presents a crisscrossing subtext with numerous overlaps. In our world, the period between the two world wars allowed for the larger societal dissatisfaction to curdle into outright hatred and destructive nationalism. In the film, it happens all at once, with Dmitri using the increasingly oppressive Zig Zag corps to place Gustav in prison for a murder that the son himself almost certainly committed (Céline’s) — the ZZ is more than happy to play along to continue aligning itself with wealth and power. The allegory there is pretty simple as this is, effectively, what happened in Germany as soon as it was clear that the Nazi party was gaining insurmountable ground in the political sphere. Better to team up and consolidate rather than fight back.
What followed, tragically, was the Holocaust — a decade-long massacre across Europe that claimed the lives of an estimated 6 million Jews and millions of others based solely on their religion, ethnicity, political stances, or sexual orientation. Much of Eastern European culture, particularly Polish and Czech, was expressly suppressed and overtaken by the Aryan Reich — what was originally there was deemed too intellectual, too ephemeral, too Jewish. When we return to the hotel in the movie’s third act we see that nearly every shred of pink and rose and red, the ornate nature of the palatial estate we marveled at earlier on, is covered in black banners with ZZ logos. The total decimation of the structure has not yet taken place (the version of the hotel we see in widescreen), but the first attempt is apparent. Rather than tear down and rebuild in their own image, ZZ would rather cover up and pretend it was always theirs.
Working backward, it is no surprise that the monastery in the mountains provides little more than a detour, pretending to help Gustav and Zero find the one informant who can clear the concierge’s name (and, we will learn, knows about the contents of a secret will that has been hidden within the sought-after portrait). Instead, they are so ineffectual as to allow Dmitri’s bodyguard and hitman, J. G. Jopling (Willem Dafoe), to murder Madame D’s butler, Serge X (Mathieu Amalric), inside of a confessional. An irony, to be sure, but one also not without its real-world parallels like everything else.
The rise of fascism in Germany and Italy is a seminal tragedy borne in the wake of another, but we shouldn’t ignore the power structures that refused to stand in their way. And while the already rich and powerful certainly have gotten their due blame, a key group that gets largely forgotten in their culpability is the Catholic Church. The Vatican, and Pope Pius XII specifically, was largely silent during the Holocaust despite numerous pleas for help. I’ve heard it argued that there was only so much the Church could have publicly done, but I must disagree. Behind the scenes, Pius himself sheltered a small number of Jews and privately urged a few of his closest officials to do the same. But publicly, he remained neutral and refused to condemn the actions of Nazi Germany. He was more afraid of retaliation than doing what was right, despite the fact that the largely Catholic continent routinely looked to him for guidance. By outwardly staying silent it gave license to the general public to do the same. He allowed the assassins into the monastery.
A common thread throughout Grand Budapest is how it was truly the common man who maintained and tried to protect the precious culture and history that those in charge seemed more than willing to dismiss and destroy. When Gustav decides to secret “Boy with Apple” out of Madame D’s estate before anybody can stop him it is with the help of the staff, including Serge X and the maid Clotilde (Léa Seydoux), that the painting makes its way to the safe in the hotel (though it is Clotilde’s betrayal and Serge’s false testimony that lead Dmitri to Gustav — collaborators came from everywhere). To break Gustav and his new compatriots out of the comically large prison, it takes cooperation and coordination from everyone around him, including a fellow prisoner not in on the escape keeping quiet out of solidarity. The tools used are snuck in via Mendl’s fantastic baked goods, made with love by his assistant and Zero’s soon-to-be wife Agatha (Saoirse Ronan), and even the prison guards are too enamored with the craft and design to risk ruining the beauty to check for contraband. What’s more, the concierges across Europe are banded together in a secret society to ensure that nothing is lost that shouldn’t be.
So, too, did normal people carry the burden of protection of people and culture from the Nazis as their scourge spread across Europe. It wasn’t the bourgeois who hid Jews or assisted the allies in their attacks on German soldiers in France, but the everyday working class and those in bureaucratic positions with the power to do more than their jobs required. There are famous names among them, such as Oskar Schindler who spent a fortune protecting 1,100 Jews, and Raoul Wallenberg who risked his life (and lost it) smuggling over 7,000 more out of Europe, but many of the righteous were unknown and overlooked. These were people who had little to gain and so much to lose, and yet felt the need to act anyway. In addition to the lives that were saved, there are numerous artifacts, religious and secular, that only exist today because of the kindness regular men and women showed, great works of art that only survived due to their help.
Gustav H, in many ways, represents all of them in one. He is shown to be a solitary man content to live, alone, in the confines of a small closet nestled within the grand hotel’s chambers. He reads his men poetry during dinner every night, despite them paying little to no attention while they stuff their faces with delicious food (that he, himself, will not be eating). He values the painting not because of what it can make him financially (although he does recognize the practical nature of doing so before anyone can steal it back), but because of the beauty it contains — the painting will one day find its home behind his desk in the hotel and seemingly stay there until the establishment is demolished. He is also a man who wishes to comport with the elite (much like Schindler did), using his position to attend to the wealthy clientele (particularly the women), but he never truly becomes them even when the secret will names him to be the inheritor of the entire Grand Budapest Hotel, which Madam D is revealed to be the silent owner of prior to her death.
Of course, his most selfless act is his protection of Zero from certain death. Zero is a refugee from a different war-torn nation, a young man without a home or family to return to. It is clear from their encounter with the ZZ in the barley field that he is considered an undesirable, but Gustav refuses to allow anything to happen to the boy. He can say all he wants that it’s because he doesn’t want to replace such a perfect lobby boy, but we know he cares for those who need protection by his actions. Despite not having much to pass on himself, he makes Zero his sole heir — a gesture that Zero takes to heart and never forgets. The two become inseparable, and Gustav’s desire to shelter him will unfortunately lead to his demise. Near the end, the two are once again accosted on a train passing through the same barley field. The faux principles espoused during the First World War have since given way to true hatred and violence. There is no protecting Zero anymore, and Gustav is shot unceremoniously.
“We have lost some enthusiasm, it is true. We don’t go now in rose-colored spectacles to exhibitions, but we haven’t forgot when we did so.”
In June of 1830, a now-unknown author published the above in the essay “A Gossip About Art and Artists”, the earliest known example of any variation of the term “Rose Colored Glasses”. It harkens back to a time when many would where spectacles not to aid their vision, but to instead recolor the world around them in hues of pink and rose, to better hide blemishes and mistakes. A combination of two older turns of phrase, the 1700s use of the term “rosy” to denote cheerfulness and optimism, and the older still use of spectacles to represent one’s ability to discern the world around them. By bringing the two together, the author recognized that we once used rose-colored glasses to pretend we could see the world better with a different perspective, turning nightmares into beauty. The actual practice may be gone, but the irony in their writing indicates that the practice has become metaphorical.
For a director as keenly aware of his production design, the colors used in any Wes Anderson film cannot be viewed as accidental. Across his filmography, there is a pattern — darker and richer colors are readily prevalent, particularly browns, greens, and blues. There are always flashes of yellow and the occasional deep red, but rarely anything that one could deem “rosy”. The contrast he creates with harsh colors used to populate the measured and meticulous diorama of set design allows for an obvious subtext that beneath the layers of control and order there is a darkness and uncertainty that plagues all of us. The Grand Budapest begins with these same color palettes, the only notable red being the carpet strewn over the hotel lobby in 1968. But when we move backward to Gustav’s era, nearly every aspect of the hotel is pink, rosy, and lovely. Even the uniforms of the hotel staff are royal purple. The only spot that is not resplendent with the blushing hues is Gustav’s room, which is instead drab and light brown.
Anderson is telling a story, through the eyes of an old man, of a time long past and one that he views with great affection. The story, far more than any Wes has told before or since, is incredibly dark and violent. We are seeing a world attempting to hold on to its history and culture while the forces gaining ground are doing everything they can to strip it away, and because of the framing device (and our knowledge of actual history), we know that one day, it will. It’s no surprise that from Zero’s perspective, the time of his greatest adventure, fraught though it may be, is colored as rosy as the most beautiful flower he’s ever seen. Zero loves the hotel, he loves Gustav, and he loves what Zubrowka once was to a young, scared, orphaned boy searching for a new life and new home.
Zero also loves Agatha, though it is clear early on that she will be tragically lost before the Author makes his visit. When her image is first shown, Zero refuses to even discuss her further — it is too painful. When he, finally, begins to elaborate on their courtship it is with a grand smile and flowing tears that he does so. In his telling, the lights of Zubrowka revolve around her wonderful visage, a halo around a woman taken far too soon. We, the listeners, are like the Author wondering what tragedy would befall her — we even briefly believe that Jopling took her life, leading to an upsetting sense of relief when it is revealed his victim was instead Serge’s sister (why should we care any less about her?). In the end, her death is even more unceremonious than Gustav’s will be just one scene later. After the adventure is over Gustav presides over Zero and Agatha’s wedding, though instead of joy we get the matter-of-fact tale of how she died within two years.
“The Prussian grippe. An absurd little disease,” Zero tells us. “Today, we treat it in a single week; but in those days, many millions died.”
Recognizing the danger of looking at the past through rose-colored glasses is just as important as remembering the beauty that we lost. If Anderson was somehow making the argument that the world was a better place before the war, he undercuts it so brilliantly in moments just like this. We may be living in a time when so much of what made the world worth living in is gone, but it is also true that we don’t have to worry about disease in the same way — the things that killed millions without fail are now as survivable as a cold to most of us with the proper treatment and care (something we’ve seen since in compressed real-time with the COVID pandemic). Wars are still taking place across the globe, but many of us are privileged enough to live in places where that is not currently the case.
The question remains why Zero has chosen to maintain the hotel even in its dilapidated state, and why he chooses to return to a place that brings him so much pain regularly. The Author surmises that it must be his way of remembering the world his mentor, Gustav, cherished, one of class and culture. Zero, instead, dismisses this.
“You see, we shared a vocation, it wouldn’t have been necessary. No, the hotel I keep for Agatha. We were happy here, for a little while.” As for the world Gustav cherished, he continues, “To be frank, I think his world vanished long before he ever entered it. But I will say, he certainly sustained the illusion with marvelous grace.”
The Grand Budapest Hotel is a movie in a fictional place but in a real time, one when Europe wanted to pretend that, despite the devastation of The Great War, the era of prestige and bourgeois charm of the late 1800s was still intact and not, in fact, a dead man walking. People like Gustav H. lovingly acted as caretakers both in an attempt to restore this perceived greatness but also to remember it, in case it ever truly was lost. Gustav’s legacy is not the hotel he oversaw nor the wealthy women he consorted with, but the memories and ideas that he passed onto Zero. The same is true of us — we are the caretakers of the best of our time and our world. It is our responsibility to pass what we cherish onto future generations. But, it is vital that we do not forget the challenges and the problems that we collectively endured as well. Recalling our era with rose-colored glasses will only make it harder for the future to maintain what it has, what it cherishes. Only once we can enjoy the great things we have and learn from the mistakes surrounding them can we truly be the concierges to the next generation.

Budapest is only one hour flight from Frankfurt. I have heard so many great reviews of the city that I decided it was time to visit the capital of Hungary.
Jacob had a birthday on the 10th of October and I decided to surprise him by flying with him to Budapest for three days. Turned out, it was a fantastic present for both of us.
In the BUD airport, I withdrew local forints from an ATM, bought my 3-day Budapest public transportation ticket, and off we went to the city center by bus.
It turned out the only time I needed cash was when I used city toilets. All the restaurants, cafes, museums, and parking garages accept credit cards.
On the second thought, we found another use for unspent forints. More about it in the next story about the city.😉
Our apartment was located in a beautiful and grandiose building erected at the beginning of the 20th century, at the time when modern Hungary was a part of the powerful Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.
The apartment was located in a mostly flat Pest part of the capital, just 10 minutes walking distance away from the Hungarian Parliament building. From there, we could enjoy fantastic views of the hilly Buda and Obuda parts of the city, located across the Danube River.

We arrived in Budapest yesterday afternoon. It took quite a bit to get here from Wisconsin but that’s for another post. Our travels went as planned and we stepped on to the Viking Longship we were traveling on around 2 o’clock in the afternoon.
After drinks, dinner, and partially unpacking in our stateroom, I dragged my husband across town to walk over the famous Chain Bridge at night to get a much-wanted, even required, photograph of the Budapest Parliament Building.
It and other buildings in Budapest are beautifully illuminated at night, as are the bridges that span the Danube River in that part of Hungary.
Walking from our boat, between the Liberty Bridge and the Elizabeth Bridge, to the Parliament Building was at least a couple of miles. After traveling on a plane for most of the last day, walking was a welcome relief.
My husband and I are big walkers on vacation. We enjoy it.
Before we got to the Chain Bridge, we had beautiful views of Buda Castle high on the Budapest side of the Danube. Again, gorgeous!

It was the summer of 2015. My husband and I travelled to Budapest with our son and his better half.
Our three-day trip to the city was the most enjoyable and unforgettable. Budapest has a distinct charm, and its glorious setting astride the Danube River makes it a great place to visit.
The Budapest vacation helped us to build lifelong memories and break away from the usual hectic routine. It allowed us to enjoy a new culture, food and experiences.
The Szenchenyi chain bridge spans the river Danube between Buda on the western side and Pest on the eastern side. It is a permanent bridge across the Danube in Hungary. A series of bridges connect Buda and Pest.
Budapest is the most beautiful city on the Danube. The city’s panorama is breathtaking, and you can enjoy the most when on a cruise ship.
The best part of the tour was taking a cruise down the Danube, passing landmarks like the National Parliament and Buda Castle. It was an incredible experience!
Especially in the evening hours when you get to see the illuminated parliament. You get to enjoy the complimentary welcome drink as you take in the sights of the city.
The Liberty bridge is the southernmost public road bridge in Budapest. It is the shortest bridge in the centre of Budapest.
Our Funicular ride to the Buda Castle was enjoyable. You get a captivating view of the city below.
Buda Castle is a remarkable castle. The National Gallery, National Library and the History Museum are located inside this castle. It sits on the top of the castle hill.
We enjoyed the old-fashioned pastry shops and many good cafes and restaurants — a must-see place for anyone visiting Budapest.
Every colourful dish was equally inviting, and it was difficult to resist the temptation to gobble them all up!
The Dohany Synagogue was very close to our Airbnb. It is the largest European synagogue and has a seating arrangement for nearly 3000 people.
You can see travellers clicking pictures of the interior. You get to see the brilliant Tohrah Ark made of coloured and golden geometric shapes.
The weeping willow tree is in the synagogue's backyard. It has metal leaves on which family names of Hungarian Jews murdered in the Holocaust are carved.
On the last day of our stay, we visited the St Gerard Sagredo statue. It is one of the historical landmarks in Budapest.
The views from this place on top of the hill are stunning — one of the most visited attractions in Budapest.
Heroes Square is one of the major squares in Budapest. It has the museum of fine arts on the left and the Palace of art on the right.
The central feature is the Millennium memorial. The two colonnades behind the monument each have seven statues representing significant figures of Hungarian history.
“Travelling in the company of those we love is home in motion.”- Leigh Hunt.
The most significant benefit of family travel is bonding with the dearest people in your life and exploring places together.
Every year we look forward to family travel, visiting a new place, exploring and creating memories.

I wouldn’t classify myself as spontaneous. I always like to evaluate and ponder big decisions or dilemmas before taking any action. That being said I am becoming more aware of the privilege that being in my early 20s affords me. I am not settled in a specific place, have no real commitments apart from my work and no one yet depends on me to live their life. I find stating this particularly freeing, it is good to be able to make last-minute plans with friends and this is a luxury that is only typically afforded at the start and end of your life. However, this is not something I usually take advantage of and most recently I have been wanting to utilize it as I know I will miss it as life progresses.
In the company I work at, we have an internal shop slack channel where people can buy or sell goods. Last month, my friend spotted last-minute plane tickets being sold a week in advance for a weekend getaway to Budapest and naturally he suggested that we go. I was originally unsure about this, I wanted to spend this weekend achieving some tasks before climbing in Portland. But naturally, something in my mind told me to use this privilege in my life and go on the trip. So somewhat apprehensively I agreed! This blog is going to go over our adventure in Budapest!
Day 1
Our departing flight left at 8 am, so this meant a 5 am starting journey to Luton airport (thanks Ben for driving us). I typically don’t like taking early morning flights but I really enjoyed the experience of waking up early and being in another country by lunchtime.
Our flight landed just after lunch, and after getting through the terrible queues for passport control (thank you Brexit!) we got a bus and metro into town and picked out a great brunch spot for lunch called cookie beacon. This was a great restaurant to eat, it catered for Ben’s burger craving and my gluten allergy. They also had keto cookies, which were really good and filling. During this time we outlined what we wanted to achieve on this trip, where we wanted to go and the experiences we wanted to have.
We first headed into central Budapest (on the Pest side of the river) to check out a thermal bath. We decided that as it was a Friday, this was the best time to try and go to avoid it being overcrowded. We chose the Széchenyi Thermal Bath, while it is more expensive than some of the other baths it looked much better and was located in a lovely area near the central park. I would definitely recommend checking out a bath while in Budapest, while it is not on the level of the Blue Lagoon in Iceland they don’t have the eggy smell that sulphur baths have and unlike a swimming pool, they get very warm.
One word of advice is to make sure you bring your own flip-flops to these baths, most require you to wear them and the prices they charge for them are extortionate!
After spending the afternoon in the bath, we took a walk back to the Airbnb we picked out and cooked up some dinner, excited to make the most of our time in the country.
Day 2
As this was our only full day in Budapest we wanted to make the most of it. We decided to take an early morning walking tour of Budapest. These are pretty common in Europe, they are free to sign up for and the tour guide will expect tips at the end. I always enjoy taking these types of tours when a visit a new city, they are a great way to see as much of the city as you can and they provide much-needed context to any attractions.
We had a great tour guide (thanks Regina!), and some highlights for me included the St. Stephen’s Basilica church, the USSR and Nazi monuments and the Hungarian Parliament building. Regina was incredibly knowledgeable about all the sites we stopped off at and gave some great recommendations for clubs and bars in Budapest to visit.
One interesting moment for me during the tour was the Nazi monument. This monument was created in memory of the Nazi invasion and subsequent occupation of Hungary. As Regina explained to us, this statue has potential implications that Hungary is absolved from collaboration with the Nazi government and the actions that they took. As a result, this is a controversial attraction for some, especially Jewish Hungarians.
After taking the tour we grabbed some lunch and then walked across the river to Buda to visit the castle, stopping to take some scenic pictures of the Hungarian parliament building from the river.
To end our day we decided to double down on our spontaneity and go to a bar and club. We received a great piece of advice from Regina to visit the Szimpla Kert ruin bar, these ruin bars are built from bombed buildings in WW2. Instead of being rebuilt, they were minimally converted into bars and make for a really nice setting as they have a lot of natural light and character to them.
We ended our day with a night out at the Instant-Fogas Complex club. Clubbing is not something that I do often as in the past I have not had enjoyable experiences, but in the spirit of this holiday, I thought I would give it another go. Surprisingly we had a great time, even catching the closing stages of a Hungarian rock concert before the dancefloor started getting busy.
Day 3
After enjoying ourselves the night before we decided to have a lazy morning. We grabbed coffee at Anna’s cafe in the centre near the river and then relaxed in Elizabeth Square. At lunchtime, we headed back to the airport to catch our flight home.
Conclusions
Overall this was a really special trip for me. It took me outside of my comfort zone for the first time in a while and also took me away from my regular schedule. It felt really good to be spontaneous and I loved the trip. Budapest is a wonderful city full of beauty, character and history. Is it hard to comprehend coming from Britain that within the space of 70 or so years, Hungary has known 3 different types of political systems. It opens your mind and after all, that is the beauty of travelling, to take yourself out of your bubble and experience another country’s culture and educate yourself on their history.
Usually, I am very keen on planning out a schedule when going abroad, but during this trip I allowed myself to relax and let the plans get made as and when we chose to. There was something very freeing and relaxing about this. This was only possible as I had such good friends with me, I could trust that I could be honest with them and we had each other best interests at heart.
Overall this trip has been an amazing experience and I can’t wait to go on another weekend trip, spontaneous or not!

It was early on Thursday morning.
Neither my dad nor I got a good night’s sleep.
My father ate something which evidently didn’t agree with him.
While I was jittery with a mixture of anxiety and excitement.
Excited because I was about to visit a part of the world I’d never been to before:
Eastern Europe.
Prior to this experience, I’d never stepped foot in Eastern Europe before.
Sure, technically speaking, Istanbul is in Eastern Europe.
And I’d also been to Greece as a kid.
But this was different.
For the first time in my life, I’d be venturing deep into the land of the iron curtain.
I’d heard so much about this part of the world, and in modern times it’s been described as a European paradise.
All the benefits of capitalism while maintaining its traditional roots.
Something I wish I could say the same about Britain.
So yes, I was excited.
But I was also anxious.
Not about the journey, but about something else.
Namely my love life.
But I’ll save that for day 3.
Stick around and keep reading this series if you’d like to know what happens.
Either way, I barely got any sleep before our flight and was absolutely knackered.
I woke up around 8 and got ready for the taxi’s arrival at 9.
Everything was going according to plan.
We left the house at 9AM and zoomed off to the airport.
Despite the airport being miles away, we got there in just 45 minutes.
0 traffic = 0 problems.
The airport too was a walk in the park.
We checked our bags in with zero problems and got through security without a single hiccup.
I was a little nervous about the sheet of paper I’d been given by the immigration beaurea.
It didn’t look super legit and I wasn’t sure if I’d be turned away at passport control.
Thankfully, I didn’t and everything was cool.
We find our gate and chill out in the seats.
After a few minutes of listening to music and playing chess, we were ready to board the plane.
We queue up and see something strange…
Some people are being escorted out of the line and are being told some awful news.
Me and my dad looked at each other, puzzled.
What could possibly be going on?
Turns out, some people weren’t given any seats to board the plane!
It seems Budapest is quite a popular destination.
Thank goodness we had the foresight to check-in online prior to arriving at the airport, otherwise it would have been us who’d be escorted out of the line.
With a sigh of relief and a few empathetic looks, we were on the plane and seated.
The flight flew by in a flash as I slept through all of it.
2 hours later, we were in Budapest and ready to start our Eastern European adventure.
I’d done some research and was clued up on what to do once arriving at the airport.
We did all the formal stuff like going through passport control and picking up our bags.
Next came the fun part:
Finding our way into the city.
Me and my dad each bought a 15 day transport pass which allowed us unlimited access on every transportation in the city for… you guessed it, 15 days.
I had a look online and people were saying there was a week pass, but they’ve clearly changed it.
Either way, we grabbed one of those (called a 15-Day Budapest Pass) and made our way to the bus stop.
The plan was to get the 100E bus which would take us straight into the city centre.
We would have done this if it weren’t for the fact that our Budapest pass isn’t valid for that particular bus (typical).
I asked one of the conductors what to do and he told us we could get the 200E bus that would take us to where we needed to go.
Sweet!
I picked up a map and started doing some high IQ geographical calculations in my head.
I love this about going to a new place.
There’s a certain thrill about figuring out how to find your way around.
I do this everywhere I go.
When I first lived in Istanbul, I would always be hopping on different buses/tubes and exploring.
When I moved to London, I’d spend months venturing into the city centre and finding my way round.
Budapest was no exception.
We got on the 200E bus and ended up at the closest Metro station (Kőbánya-Kispest).
This was our first taste of Hungary, and I’m not gonna lie, it was weird.
A lot of the advertising was similar to the stuff you’d see in rural Turkey, except with a European twist.
Instead of a woman in a headscarf advertising a homemade pide restaurant, we had juiced up Europeans advertising a local supplement company.
The buildings were a mix of modern monstrosities and Soviet era crumblings.
It wasn’t until we entered the city of Budapest that I was faced with the sheer beauty of humanity’s potential.
There was also a moment where a homeless guy walked onto the bus and stunk the place up.
It brought me back to a sunny Spring day in Sheffield where a man who hadn’t showered in months had everyone gasping for fresh air with his stench.
Not exactly the warmest welcome…
From Kőbánya-Kispest we took the blue M3 Metro line to Ferenciek Tere.
If you’re curious, this is right into the centre of Pest and just a minutes walk from the Danube.
In hindsight, we didn’t need to go to this station as Deak Ferenc Ter (the stop before it) would have helped us get to our desired destination a lot faster.
Even so, we learnt this later on after some research.
From Ferenciek Tere we walked on the main street up towards Astoria and eventually reached Blaha Lujza Ter (where our hotel and subsequently our AirBNB was).
On our walk, we got our very first look at Budapest.
And honestly?
I was a little underwhelmed.
Lots of homeless people.
A strange smell in the air (mostly urine).
Much fewer Hungarians than I had pictured.
And it was absolutely scorching hot.
No doubt, this was my fault.
I had this idea of Hungary being a European bastion of beauty.
I expected everything to be pristine, clean and perfect.
With those kinds of high standards, I was bound to be met with some dissapointment.
If you’re Hungarian and reading this, don’t be offended.
I love Budapest.
I just want to give you my honest first impressions before fully discovering the true beauty of the city.
After a few minutes of walking, I noticed something concerning.
My dad was limping.
And he wasn’t limping a little, he was limping quite heavily.
He’d mentioned the night before our flight that he had a pain in his foot, and clearly the pain hadn’t subsided.
I asked him if he was alright and he grimaced back, “I’m fine, just get a bloody move on”.
I heard the man and we marched on towards our hotel.
We didn’t have to march long as within a few minutes were outside our hotel in the middle of town.
It was a really weird hotel.
Looked utterly rubbish on the outside, but the inside was as lavish as you could possibly imagine.
It’s called the Atrium Fashion Hotel and it’s located on Csokonai utca, one street behind the Blaha Lujza ter Metro station.
If you want to visit Budapest, I think you’d enjoy your time at this hotel.
Our room was cosy, the hotel staff were extremely helpful and friendly (Hi Adam!) and it’s right in the centre of Pest.
We were only there for one night, but we had a good time.
After getting into our room, we did what any normal people would do:
Have a shower and then a nap.
(Not together obviously, that would be weird lol).
After waking up, it was pretty late.
Like I said, neither of us slept well the night before and needed to recover.
Once we woke up, it was time to go for a wander.
My dad struggled to get into his trainers as his foot was as swollen as Arnold Schwarzenegger’s biceps. But once they were in, we were ready to go.
The first point of call was to find the place where my dad would be attending his business conference.
While he’d be spending most of his days in Budapest there, I’d be free to check out the Hungarian capital solo.
After swerving in and out of meandering side-streets, we were able to find the conference hall with little difficulty.
Weirdly, it was located right in the middle of Pest’s party district.
Surrounding the conference venue were plenty of pubs, bars and nightclubs which were teeming with tourists and locals all day and all night.
Luckily for us, we were also able to find an incredible Hungarian restaurant with a live pianist.
My dad instantly fell in love with the piano player and couldn’t stop applauding his every move.
I honestly think he loved the music more than the food, which is saying something because the food was outstanding.
I had a Goulash soup followed by a Goulash dish.
The result?
Love.
I officially love Hungarian food.
It’s incredible.
While I was busy guzzling down the wonderful meal that was in front of me, my dad was staring starry eyed at the pianist as he played love songs with his elegant fingers.
At one point, my dad got so into it that he began singing at the top of his lungs and began drawing confused looks from everyone in the restaurant.
My cheeks flushed red in embarassment as I pleaded for him to stop, but he wouldn’t listen:
“WEEEE ARE THE CHAMPIONS, MY FRIENDS…..
AND WEEEE’LL, KEEP ON FIIIGHTING TILL THE END…”
Safe to say we both had a great time on our first night in Budapest.
Tomorrow would be even better…
If you liked this little story, stay tuned for the next ones.
I’m going to be sharing everything I did and all the things I was feeling on my travels.
Thanks for reading,
Godfrey

Budapest, like other capital cities, have interesting memorials and statues that turn heads and force conversation. And there are plenty of them too; afterall, the largest statue park in Europe is also here, measuring a huge 56 hectares (Kerepesi Cemetery).
Memento Park is also just outside the city, and born from a difficult past. After the lifting of the Iron Curtain, Hungarians uprooted and dumped almost every statue placed during the communist period. Out of the city; out of the mind. The following are a list of the most interesting statues in Budapest.
Belgrád rkp., 1056
A lovely stroll down the Pest-side of the Danube pedestrian zone will bring you to these two wholesome figures. It’s a spitting distance to the ‘little princess’, and a beautiful place to photograph and take in the views of the Buda side. Look out for The Marriott Hotel.
Actually, not much is known about these statues, except that the Sculptor Raffay Dávid had known he wanted to be a sculptor from an early age — three years old!
Széchenyi Lánchíd, 1051
When I first arrived in Budapest, I was told the Myth about the Lions on the four corners of the Széchenyi Bridge. It goes a little something like this.
In 1852, sculptor János Marschalkó unveiled his stone work to be used on the recently opened Széchenyi Bridge. He was so proud of his work that he announced he would throw himself off the bridge if any faults were found. The story goes on to say that a girl spoke up that the lions had no tongues. He threw himself off the bridge out of embarrassment.
Whether he did or not, it’s a story full of passion, big-headedness, and a pinch of comedy (OK, tragedy). János Marschalkó lived well into the 1870’s, and for good reason — the lions HAVE tongues, they just can’t be seen from a low perspective.
NB — This made me think of The National Library in Sarajevo — Check it out!
Corvin sétány 1, 1082
I’m sure you know Bud Spencer — an actor, famous for adventure comedies, crime escapades and spaghetti westerns. This rootin’, tootin’ and gun-shootin’ Italian, originally from Naples, starred in over 50 films, a handful of TV and even a video game. Although Budapest is well known for filmmaking, Bud Spencer never came to Budapest, neither filmed any scenes here. So why the statue?
Bud Spencer didn’t receive the attention he did until he teamed up with Terence Hill in the late 60’s. Together, they created simple yet action packed films that everyone around the world could enjoy. Hungarians, during the communist occupation, fell in love with the entertainment he brought with each new film. They were the popular stars from a foreign country — an attractive one from outside the communist reach. Although they appeared dubbed, the story lines were easy enough to follow without needing to know the language.
The huge bronze statue weighs in at half a ton, and was placed there a year after his death in 2016 by sculptor Szandra Tasnádi as a beautiful sign of respect. It is the first one of its kind, and at the unveiling was Cristiana Pedersoli (daughter) and Olympic water polo player György Kárpáti (friend). The inscription “We never fought” were the words Terrence Hill used to describe Bud at his funeral.
Zrínyi u., 1051
One of the most visited and famous statues in Budapest is the fat policeman — you can tell by his shiny belly. His location couldn’t get any better as he gets to stare at the St. Stephan's Basilica all day. Tourists can’t help but get a snap of themselves with him.
The fat policeman statue in central Budapest was sculptured by Illyés András in 2008, and can be found on the corner of Zrínyi and Október 6. Street. The sculpture itself was based on the characteristics of peoples faces dwelling in the city, with the portly physique taken from the sculptors grandfather.
Práter u. 11, 1082
This collection of statues portrays a group of boys playing marbles outside an old brick school building. It is a depiction of a scene early on in the book Pál utcai fiúk — the Paul Street Boys.
You’ll find this gem just round the corner from Corvin Shopping Plaza.
This book by Hungarian author Ferenc Molnár tells the story of two gangs of children fighting over rundown territory. The book became hugely popular and turned into a famous Hungarian classic, still taught in primary school.
NB — If you like this story, the National Museum in Budapest has created a marble run and area in honour of the Pal Street Boys — perfect for young kids!
Walking Tour Idea — If you're looking for a street map of these statues, check out our link here.
Falk Miksa u., 1055
Columbo is one of Hungary’s most admired characters — it might have something to do with Peter Falk’s Hungarian heritage. His mother, a Jewish Hungarian emigrated to the States before he was born.
His statue shows his typical thinking posture with cigar in hand, while his basset hound dog named ‘dog’ stares at him patiently. Funnily enough, the statue was placed opposite the National Comedy Theatre, and visible from Jászai Mari square.
Dob u. 12, 1072
Carl Lutz was the Budapest based Swiss Vice-Consul from 1942 until 1945 — the end of World War II. As a designer and leader of the largest most successful rescue operation, he was instrumental in saving more than 62,000 Hungarian Jews. In fact, Budapest is the only capital in Eastern Europe where enough Hungarian Jews survived to continue their community — over 100,000.
You’ll find these statues one block away from the Dohány Street Synagogue’s Tree Of Life. The inscription reads: In the building at Szabadság tér 12, Swiss Vice Consul Carl Lutz honorably represented the interests of the United States of America and other countries between 1942 and 1945. He courageously saved the lives of tens of thousands of Hungarian citizens persecuted as Jews.
Belgrád rkp., 1051
The Little Princess statue is one of the most famous sculptures in Budapest because of its perfect location. This statuette sits on the railings next to the pedestrian area on the Pest side of the Danube and scenic Tram 2. Expect great views and a perfect place for photographs.
The artist, László Marton created this in 1972, taking his eldest daughter as inspiration. Apparently, she would wear his dressing gown and parade around as a princess. This statue is so loved that copies have sprung up in the Hungarian town of Tapolca and in front of the concert hall of the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Space in Japan.
Szabadság tér 16, 1054
Ronald Reagan is a little strange as a statue in Budapest, let alone in the very important Freedom Square (Szabadság tér). It feels out of place until you realise it was created to honour Reagan and his efforts in ending the cold war. The end of the cold war would end the Soviet occupation of Hungary.
The positioning is perfect — not only is he walking toward the American Embassy, he is also staring at the monument dedicated to the Soviet liberation of Hungary in World War II from Nazi German occupation.
Vajdahunyad stny, City Park, 1146
One of the most fascinating statues in Budapest is the one known as ‘Anonymous’, and definitely one of my favourites. The hooded man is sitting in a relaxed pose, holding a pen. An inscription starts with a capital ‘P’, and continues with “dictus magister ac quondam bone memorie gloriosissimi Bele regis Hungarie notarius” (and Bela the master of the king of Hungary was struck by the notary who were once of the most glorious of good memory). The ‘P’ is likely his name, or an abbrev. of praedictus, meaning ‘aforementioned’.
The anonymous statue of Budapest was the notary of the Hungarian king Béla III, and famous for his work Gesta Hungarorum (“The Deeds of the Hungarians”) over 800 years ago. It’s the most detailed account of the Hungarians’ arrival to the Carpathian basin. Being a very important writer, people make their way to the inner court area of the Vajdahunyad Castle to touch his pen, and receive special, ungodly writing powers. Worth a try.
These statues of peoples shoes on the Danube river bank hold on to one of the haunting and saddest situations in Hungary’s history. These 60 pairs of shoes are a memory to those who were killed by Arrow Cross Party in 1944–45. Let’s back up a little.
When Germany waged war through Europe, it was only a matter of time before their attention came to Hungary. The government was overthrown in October 1944, Ferenc Szalasi was the puppet that took the job. His fascist and antisemitic ideas were poured into the Arrow Cross Party, who beat and killed Jewish citizens of the city.
As shoes were valuable, the victims were made to remove their shoes before being executed and left to fall into the cold, strong current of the Danube. Almost 100,000 Jews vanished. 80,000 Jews left the country by force, and the other 20,000 were shot along the river banks. These life-sized shoes with amazing detail were installed in 2005 by Can Togay (Director; The Summer Guest) and Gyula Pauer (Sculptor).

A lot of Hungarian soldiers and civilians died during World War I and their loved ones went numb. Their fathers, brothers, husbands and sons were somewhere away from home, either mixed in soil or were feeding themselves to birds. Until then Budapest was more attractive than a magnet to tourists from every part of the world. The post-war effects and an approach of the new war engulfed Budapest.
Budapest was now in the arms of mass suicides, which arose from the day of losing their loved ones. Budapest became “The city of Suicides”. Will you believe me if I say all these happened because of a popular song “Gloomy Sunday”, which was printed in Sunday Times? It was also called ‘the suicide song’ and ‘the killer song’. It was written in a hundred languages around the world and has claimed to have killed hundreds of people.
All the people who drowned in the deep waters of Danube River had left behind the newspaper cutting of Sunday Times, which had the lyrics of the song. It was composed by Rezső Seress and published in 1933. Here are the lines.
“Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?
Gloomy Sunday
Death is no dream,
For in death I’m caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I’ll be blessing you
Gloomy Sunday”
The song somehow gave hope to all the people who wanted to reunite with their loved ones.
In 1937, ‘The Sunday Times’ wrote an article on the “ City of Suicides”. It’s funny how the newspaper criticises and asks to ban the song and the lyricist for suicides. When it was The Sunday Times, who propagated and shared those lines throughout Budapest in the first place. The song was then banned on radios.
The politicians, social activists, common people were searching for a solution. To bring out people from their sad lives. And now professor Jeno and hypnotist Binczo brought out the“Smile School”. This was to counteract the unending love for suicides.
People of Budapest had already forgotten how to smile. Not even a four-year-old smiled. The Smile School was introducing them to a different world. At first people were made to wear a smiling mask. Teaching them, how to smile by hiding their feelings inside. They thought that teaching the people how to smile would make them happier. And finally forget the pain!
Then they started teaching different styles of smile, the Roosevelt smile, the Mona Lisa smile, the Dick Powell smile, the Loretta smile, and a lot more. They could choose the smile of any celebrity they loved and the fees was depending on the type of smile they want to master. They claimed to charge up to $500 for teaching the Roosevelt smile in six weeks. Roosevelt had the best smile!
The Mona Lisa smile is more difficult but cheaper. They were asked to do the smiles they were learning five times a day, using a mirror. Founder of Smile School, hypnotist Jeno said says the best business is enabling pupils to achieve the talent of smiling naturally.
Thousands of people around Budapest joined the Smile Schools desperately to learn how to smile! All around the world, where Budapest was once called the “ City of Suicides” a new name came up, “The City of Smiles.” However there was no reduction in suicides, the change was only in the name!
There were still people dying around with the song “ Gloomy Sunday” near the banks of Danube.
By then the whole Smile School was proved to be a hoax by Het Leven.
BUDAPEST, “CITY OF SUICIDES,” IS TAUGHT TO FORCE A SMILE
A joker in Budapest, Hungary lately evolved the “smile school” The idea was made in purpose to counteract the bad publicity Budapest has gotten from the number of suicides supposedly inspired by the Budapest song, Gloomy Sunday. The suicide rate in Budapest is actually very high, even now.
The Smile School was then shut down, with the beginning of World War II. But this simple odd idea of teaching people smile led to the evolution of Laughter brigades and Laughter clubs around the world!
Love,
Dona

I wasn’t ready for Budapest.
In 2004, T, my sister, brother-in-law, and I found super cheap flights to Budapest and decided to travel there on a whim. Being that it was 2004, Budapest wasn’t on many travelers’ radars like it is now.
Of course we expected it to be beautiful, much like many of the other European cities we had previously visited. But we had no idea just how majestic and spellbinding Budapest truly is. A magical merge of striking allure, historical grandeur, and cutting-edge grittiness that had us enamored right from the start.
There are so many things to love about Budapest, but here’s a good start: it’s brimming with stunning architecture, amazing thermal baths, breathtaking views, and a distinguished culture.
Still not convinced? It’s extraordinarily affordable, especially when compared to many other European cities.
Below are the top ten things to do in beautiful Budapest.
One of the most iconic landmarks in all of Hungary, the Parliament Building is a spectacular example of exquisite Neo-Gothic architecture. This masterpiece of a building is a popular tourist attraction, equally due to its magnificent splendor and idyllic location along the meandering Danube River. It’s worth walking around the back as well to get the full scale of its grandness, as well as the sheer beauty of the structure.
Hailing as the second longest river in all of Europe, it’s pretty much impossible to miss this imposing Danube River. Riverside strolls and sails are not only a must here, they’re pretty much inevitable. The Danube River is the beating pulse of Budapest, coursing its way through the expansive city.
Fun fact: The capital city of Budapest was the result of the unification of separate towns of Buda and Pest in 1873.
One of the many things we loved about Budapest is its walkability, and perhaps nowhere within the city encourages individuals to explore it by foot than the Szechnyi Chain Bridge.The pedestrian-friendly bridge offers fantastic views of both Buda and Pest and is one of the main bridges in Budapest that links the majority of sites.
Perched upon Castle Hill, Fisherman’s Bastion is a remarkable spot to enjoy panoramic views of the river and Pest beyond it. Its historical charm and opulence outweigh the fellow tourists that will inevitable accompany your visit. Think striking towers, spilling-over terraces, and attractive cobbled streets. A lovely spot to soak up Budapest’s radiance.
This luxurious historical castle and royal palace complex pays homage to the Hungarian kings. As the most prominent building of Castle Hill, it dominates the hill and provides beyond impressive views of the city and river. While it’s worth visiting at any time of the day, nightfall is particularly special when it’s dramatically illuminated.
Thing to know: Riding the funicular is a relatively cheap and scenic way to reach the Buda Castle hill. Click here for rates and hours of operation.
Promise me this: you will not leave Budapest without visiting at least one of its delightful spas and soaking in its thermal baths. One of the highlights of our trip was spending an afternoon at Gellert Spa and Bath. Dating back to 1918, Gellert Baths is one of the city’s oldest and most famous bathhouses.
The building’s interior is ornate and lavish, with a number of various wellness treatments offered. My sister and I opted for a massage and soak in the heated pools. Note that the establishment does get busy, so you may want to go on the earlier (or later) side in hopes of avoiding large crowds. We visited later in the day and found the spa and pools to be pretty quiet. Remember to pack your swimwear and some thick skin-the Hungarian masseuses are known to be very strong and firm (I can definitely attest to this!).
It should be no surprise that Hungarian food is HEAVY. Stick-to-your-ribs heavy. But also, pretty damn delicious. Depending on what time of year you travel to Hungary, your level of appreciation for its gluttonous heavy ways may vary. It was cold during our travels, and our bellies and souls craved as much warming comfort food as we could possibly get. So you might say that we welcomed all of its savory goulashes, stews, and soups with open hearts and eager tastebuds.
Hungarian cuisine is the epitome of comfort food, and we wouldn’t have wanted it any other way.
Hands down the best meal of the trip was at Gundel, a formal restaurant that serves delicious gourmet Hungarian fare.
There is no shortage of grand and historical coffeehouses in Budapest. If you need to seek some solace from the cold, you are in for a real treat-we absolutely loved the cafe scene here. The most charming and delightful of all of the cafes that we visited was Gerbaud, an elegant cafe that’s worthy of the hype (and elevated prices).
The coffee, pastries, and desserts were decadently divine. We absolutely loved it here.
As mentioned previously, Budapest is a gloriously walkable city, with an efficient and reliable metro system to boot, making it a very easy city to explore. Take the time to meander and marvel at the unique architecture, iconic sites, and distinctive neighborhoods.
Heroes’ Square St. Stephen’s Basilica
Okay, so technically not in Budapest, but beautiful and lovely nonetheless, is Szentendre, an enchanting and picturesque Hungarian town alongside the Danube. A short and simple forty-five minute train ride delivers you directly to the quaint little village of a town, characterized by baroque architecture, historical churches, colorful houses and narrow, cobbled streets.
The charming main square and alleyways are lined with museum and art galleries, adorable shops and boutiques, and cozy restaurants and cafes.
We were captivated by Szentendre’s beauty and quietness. An absolutely delightful day trip from Budapest!
Four full days gave us a great introduction to the amazingness of Budapest. With its more recent rise in popularity, I’d love to return one day, especially to see how much the city has changed. Wishing you the happiest of travels to beautiful Budapest and beyond!

Travelling and seeing as many places as I can is a passion. It has never been solely about showcasing pictures just for the sake of it. It’s always been about the culture, community, language of communication, behaviour of the people, the structures, monuments, the history behind it and more such. It’s about knowing and absorbing and sharing this knowledge through written work and of course images corresponding to them.
Two days spent in Budapest, the capital of Hungary 🇭🇺 was like having been there for a long time. The way we devoured the sights of this city divided in two parts by the Danube River was just nothing short of amazing. This is an enchanting city with a vintage feel. Though the whole of Europe has an old world charm, there are differences in the structures and monuments from city to city.
We left on a Sunday morning by train from Vienna to Budapest with our daughter and family. It took only a little more than two and a half hours. The train was super comfortable where we could play card games with our little grandson who was our chief entertainer. Once there we took local trams and trains, hopping in and out of them to get around. But it was mostly a walking tour with our 4 year old in tow. He had his scooter and stroller when he required them. In his name we took a few ice cream and snack breaks. It was 35 degrees in the scorching sun which we combated with water, hats and sunscreen, running to the shaded parts of the promenades whenever possible.
After checking in at the hotel in Pest, we headed to Vajdahunyad Castle. It is a grand castle which has parts of buildings from different time periods displaying varied architectural styles. Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque. Its facade looks like a fairy tale castle. It’s an amazing amalgamation with a vast garden around it. This castle with vibrant stain glass windows, houses a museum of the Hungarian life over the years. It features their farming culture, use of animals such as cattle and horses. All the floors are lined with portrayals of the village life. Our grandson had an exciting time in the castle museum looking and touching all the stuffed real looking animals. He could even milk a fake cow.
The garden at the castle is vast, well tended and lush.
There is a sinister looking statue of a hooded person in the courtyard. It reminded me of ‘He who must not be named’ or Lord Voldemort from Harry Potter. It is the statue of Anonymus, created by Miklós Ligeti. Anonymus was a 12th-century chronicler whose real name remains a mystery. He served as a notary to King. He inspired the Dracula stories in books and movies. On the outer wall of the castle, there’s also a bust of Béla Lugosi, the Hungarian-American actor who is renowned for his role as Count Dracula in the original 1931 film.
While coming out of the castle grounds, we saw a hot air balloon at a distance. Naturally we walked towards it to go up in the air on it. When we approached the ticket counter and enquired we were told the balloon will go up only at 6 pm. It was only noon time and it was impossible to come back for it. We all felt ‘deflated’ by it.
Budapest is made up of two formerly separate cities, Buda and Pest, which lie on opposite sides of the Danube River. The Chain Bridge, which we saw from a distance, completed in 1849, was the first to connect them. In 1873, the two cities were officially unified under the name Budapest. We remained in the Pest side as we didn’t have time to go to Buda. Perhaps when we come next, we can only cover Buda, which apparently is a classier and more residential part of the city.
In spite of the intense heat, we lingered at the banks of the Danube which reflected the blue of the sky with a few boats floating on it. We saw the majestic looking Parliament building, which is the largest building in Hungary. Built in 1904, it’s a gothic structure influenced by the City Hall in Vienna. It’s declared as a UNESCO Heritage site.
While searching online for places to visit, my daughter came across this powerful memorial. Lined along the riverbank are worn looking cast iron shoes, symbolizing the Jewish victims shot into the Danube during World War II. Seeing it deeply moved me, as it brought the horrors of that time to life. This was created by film director Can Togay and sculptor Gyula Pauer. It honours Jews killed by members of the Arrow Cross Party. Victims were forced to remove their shoes before being shot, their bodies falling into the river. The memorial marks the place where they stood ..only their shoes remained.
The one regret I have is not having been able to go across the famous Chain Bridge to Buda. I looked at it longingly, the beauty of it enhanced by the blue of the Danube. Designed by English engineer William Tierney Clark and built by Scottish engineer Adam Clark, it was the first bridge across the Danube in Hungary. It was opened in 1849.
We stayed in Pest as it’s the livelier side, full of attractions, and it’s where most tourists end up wanting to spend their time in Budapest. It was crowded in the popular squares of the area where we stopped in shaded cafes to have cool drinks. Great for people watching. The Intercity Hotel was very comfortable. We slept well out of sheer exhaustion that night and had a filling breakfast in the morning.
Next day we went in search of The Metropolitan Ervin Szabó Library in Budapest, famous for its vintage interiors. It is a sprawling public library complex, with its main structure in an ornate 19th-century former palace, built in neo baroque style. Unfortunately we could not go into the classical side because there was a film shooting going on. What a disappointment! We had to make do with wandering in the less interesting part where there was a modern lending library. We admired the facade and had lunch at a near by open restaurant with our little hero making up games and running all around. I had an interesting salad with sun-dried tomatoes, red lettuce and Hungarian cheese topped with blueberry marmalade.
We debated going to Buda for a quick visit but we were not sure whether we would get back to the train station in time for our return. We decided to go and see the largest synagogue in Europe which was a few minutes walk away. It is a magnificent structure built between 1854 and 1859. It has twin octagonal towers topped by onion domes which has an oriental touch. The Star of David is embossed into the stone tablets. There is alternating yellow and red brick work on the imposing building ..standing the test of time.
Again sadly we could not go in because it was time to get back to our hotel for our luggage and head to the station. But we were happy to view the awe inspiring facade.
Some of the underground metro stations take you back in time like the late 1800s or early 1900s because of its vintage feel. It is compact and quaint in its tiled look with wooden benches and frames. Took me back into another era. Loved the ageless feeling while waiting for train which itself looked as if it was from another time long past. I visualised suited, hatted gentlemen with their canes or hooked umbrellas and slender women in long frocks and fashionable hats of that time waiting at the station.
I forgot to mention the street book shop that we saw while walking towards the Ervin Sazbo Library. It was heartening to see the lovely colourful cart with hoards of books surrounded by eager buyers. Mostly Hungarian books, so we didn’t delve further. We also passed by a big well organised secondhand book store with books from floor to ceiling.
Though there were hardly any books in English, it was a sight to behold and to be photographed.
On Sunday after our sightseeing and long walks in the hot sun, we went for dinner in a restaurant where they served beverages on little trains. This place was chosen for the youngest and most important traveller in our group. We ordered Hungarian food and drinks. It was fascinating to see the drinks coming on mini trains. There were railway tracks on every table. There was live music by musicians who came from table to table. They played a Greek song for us at our request along with Hungarian and German. It was a unique experience.
On our return train, I dozed off almost half the way vaguely listening to the little fella’s chatter like a lullaby in the background. Felt good to be back to our present turf reminiscing about the two days well spent in Budapest, thanks to our daughter and son in law. A special thanks to the little one for entertaining us all through.

Budapest has become one of the top tourist destinations in Europe, for a good reason. Often, we do not recognize the beauty of the place that we live in anymore. But Budapest is simply amazing, and there is no reason to argue about it. It is not a city to tick in one or two days. Here you can easily spend a week discovering something new. But as in every place, being a tourist or live and work somewhere are two different things. Read till the end of this article if you want to know more about the complex image and the less charming sides of Budapest as well.
After having been to several corners of Europe, I can say that Budapest is the most picturesque city at night when it is enveloped in lights. No, it is not Paris. Budapest is the city divided by the river Danube into two parts, Buda as Pest. Hence the name Budapest.
I can be bored of seeing Jungfrau in Switzerland, the picturesque villages of Austria, or the countless churches of Italy. Still, I cannot cross the river Danube without throwing an eye on the ensemble of stunning monuments (The Buda castle, The Fisherman’s Bastion, The Chain Bridge, the…

Today, coffee is more than just a drink; it’s a necessary component of the traditional morning ritual. Coffee plays an essential role in daily life, whether you stumble out of bed and head straight for the cafetière or impatiently wait in line, hoping the barista rushes to serve you a flat white so you can get to work on time. Coffee has become a cultural phenomenon embedded in societies worldwide, but the journey of coffee stretches far beyond the early-morning hustle of today’s world. In Budapest, coffee is one of the many threads of the city’s rich tapestry. This documentary, Budapest’s Coffee Obsession, takes audiences on a historical exploration of rich brewing techniques through the travels of coffee lover Lyrkan Thuery. This paper will begin by conducting a brief textual analysis of two screen productions: Rise of Empires: Ottomans (2020) and The Story Of Coffee (2016). The analysis of the two…

A travel essay about Budapest and London, written in Copenhagen, Frankfurt, and Zagreb. I think I need to grow some roots.
Onwards!👇
When I’d come back from London, last year, I was flooded with splendor and grandiosity, yes, but was also sticky with the smell of a city that was once a heart of an empire but isn’t quite any longer. This smell emanated from every statue, monument, and stolid building. It oozed from the English gardens, swelled and dissipated with the Thames, fluttered on the rooftops like drunken pigeons. Even the somber tolling of the Big Ben carried with it an obvious verdict — an end to an era. London is well on its way to becoming just another capital city, albeit with a few more trinkets to auction, and a rather nasty sting in the form of the Trident nuclear missiles.
Coming back from Budapest I am flooded with a similar feeling, although it is far more nuanced and light. Hungary was once a rather significant European power (at least until the arrival of Ottomans and the collapse of so much European hubris). It extended all the way to Dalmatia and Slavonia in Croatia, something that is still touted by the old coat of arms scattered throughout the city — on the faces of buildings, forts, and magnificent bridges.
The city itself is monumental and even monolithic. It boasts elaborate facades studded with gargoyles, satires, and that European animal rarer than the unicorn, leprechaun, and Baba Yaga together. I am talking, of course, about the common African lion which the Europeans have elevated above every other animal of much greater use, economy, and industry. The lion can roar, yes, but is otherwise rather lazy and disinterested in the plight of both lionkind and mankind. Which, come to think of it, does a decent job of summarizing royalty worldwide.
Fine then, let the lion stand.
Walking through the streets of Budapest one eventually emerges onto the Hero Square, or the Hungarian Parliament Building, or Istvan Basilica. These buildings, along with many others, impart one of the most salient impressions of the city.
Nothing is small.
The streets are long, straight, and immensely wide, even the side streets. There are no London back alleys in Budapest. Buildings don’t come in sizes smaller than big. Some, like the Hungarian Parliament Building or the Széchenyi Medicinal Bath, are so large that it is easy to feel lost while walking their perimeter, let alone wandering their innards. Then there’s the Buda Castle on the Castle Hill, Hungarian National Library, St. Stephen’s Basilica, and a myriad of edifices that all carry with them a particularly Hungarian flavor — the beauty of Budapest architecture is incredible, improbable even, and unapologetically big.
The city has, since the 20s, been called the City of Baths, owing to the many thermal springs that soak its foundation — there are at least 6 in Budapest proper, and over a thousand in the whole of Hungary. The country essentially consists of boiling water, a few layers of dirt, and a city thrown on top, here and there.
We soaked our bodies in the Szechenyi Baths along with a thousand other people, of all colors, from every corner of the world, even those that now mostly supply the nameless people on the Hungarian fenced borders, trusting in the healing properties of thermal springs that contained sulfites and smelled the part.
The Bath itself is enormous, covering more than 6000 square meters, and boasting both indoor and outdoor thermal pools of varying temperatures. The largest outdoor pool is a special experience, particularly in the winter, with 36-degree water in 2-degree weather. Needless to say, the scalp gets a little chilly. There I also noticed a pandemic of a disease whose symptoms terrorize attention, ruin sleep, and cause a strange craning of the neck. I’m talking, of course, of the infernal smartphone whose allure seems so immense that the bathers couldn’t seem to bear parting with them, even in the pool. This forced them to hold one hand outside the water in the cold air, somewhat like the hand waving of English royalty, that is to say, dumb and unnecessary.
Since my smartphone habits are less than exemplary, I write this with slight rudeness to my cheek.
The city is nestled in a valley of hills and offers both flat grounds to cycle on and slopes to climb. In Budapest, unlike Copenhagen where I live, one has a use for the Achilles heel.
On one of the days we set out to explore the Grand Market but by the time we managed to saunter toward it, it had closed, leaving us only with a sight of its iridescent roof tiles. These tiles, called the Zsolnay tiles, are one of the most memorable sights in Budapest if you’re into that kind of a thing, which you are probably not. Neither am I, but these tiles still persist in my memory for reasons that remain unaccounted for.
With the closed doors of the Grand Market behind us, we set off across the magnificent Szabadság Bridge that joins its brethren in spanning the wide, mighty, and lazy Danube River. Even though it flows through Croatia, I’d never seen the Danube before and it was a curious feeling to know that, only a three hour drive downstream, my father had grown up in the town of Borovo, fishing and splashing his way through a childhood so far removed from mine that it sometimes seems almost fantastical.
On the other side of the river stands yet another monumental building. This time it’s the Gellért Thermal Bath whose pools gaped empty that day like the hands of a beggar who once knew splendor.
The Gellért Baths squat in the shadow of Gellért Hill, which was named after Saint Gerard who was allegedly thrown down its slopes to meet a gruesome death. The crown jewel of the hilL is the Liberty Statue, erected by the Soviets as a token to themselves for the liberation of Hungary at the end of WWII. The inscription on the bottom originally read:
“To the memory of the liberating Soviet heroes erected by the grateful Hungarian people in 1945.”
After the overthrow of communism in Europe, the inscription was later changed to:
“To the memory of those all who sacrificed their lives for the independence, freedom, and prosperity of Hungary.”
I found it an interesting example of how history, once decided upon, can certainly be changed, and changed again if need be.
Be that as it may, hundreds of people milled about the Liberty Statue under an angry, frozen Sun — some examining the high walls above, some examining the city below, but most, as you can imagine, examining the smartphone in their hands.
Of our own conduct I will not say much, except that we’d opted to breathe in the hazy vista that blankets the horizon, entwining people, nature, and the city of Budapest into a memory of a few short days touched by the long thoughts of history.
Thank you for reading.

Will: Budapest has commonly been part of a list some people call “The Four B’s of Europe”.
Belgrade, Barcelona, Budapest, and Berlin.
These are widely considered the best party cities on the continent. “Party” is subjective, but the common theme between these cities is that they all have robust club and bar scenes that are famous for many reasons. Budapest is unique because the bars have a certain type of grit, which makes them mysterious. They are usually underground, decrepit, and extremely old. But this gives them an indescribable atmosphere.
Carolina: Throughout our relationship, Will and I constantly joke about the ""Hungarian caves"" as we like to call the Budapestian bars. Personally, while my days of party raging are behind me, I do enjoy an occasional ~causal clubbing~ night out and was excited to see what Budapest had to offer.
The expectations were: cheap drinks, quirky bars, and great house music.
If we haven't mentioned it already, I regret to inform you that it turns out Budapest isn't as cheap as they say. We were disappointed to find that drink prices were on par with what we commonly find in the U.S. — $5 beers and $12 cocktails. There were, however, a few spots closer to the local and low-key end of the spectrum that we truly enjoyed.
Kisüzem (1st and 2nd photos above) is a casual sit-down bar on the outskirts of the Jewish Quarter where Will and I got to enjoy $4 beers and $9 cocktails.
It was the perfect place to kick off a night out or even just to grab some drinks and chat. While the vibes of Kisüzem were very relaxed, it was extremely hard to score a table or even a windowsill to sit on outside. Most of the people were chatting in Hungarian — which made it seem like a popular spot amongst the locals.
Will: The most famous (probably) tourist bar in Budapest is known as Szimpla Kert (pictured above). It’s interchangeable with the “ruins bar” and is usually the first result on Google for the query “Best bars in Budapest”. When people say “ruins bars”, they are talking about this place, which is located in the heart of the Jewish Quarter. It’s a little confusing, but it’s not “bars” plural in the sense that there are individual “bars” within the building; Szimpla Kert is a bar that has several places to buy drinks within it. Makes sense?
It’s an incredible space with multiple levels and plenty of room to roam. Inside is straight out of a Jackson-Pollack-painting-come-to-life. Various, random knick-knacks cover the walls and ceiling while each room is draped in vibrant lights. As large as it is, they still manage to pack it night after night, especially in the high season. Caro and I tried to go on a Friday around midnight, and the line was horrid. The appeal of this place is valid, and I’ll say it’s a definite must if you’re planning on going out to Budapest. Price-wise you can expect beers ranging from $5-$9 and cocktails for about $9–$13.
Carolina: Szimpla Kert is truly a sight to behold. A big part of the experience is getting lost in the maze of bars. Each one of them has its unique atmosphere. However, don't mistake this for a bar to go dancing at. While they do play music, there isn't a dance floor. Instead, there are tables where people gather around and sit to talk or play cards like we did.
Will: When it’s time to go dancing, there is one option that could satisfy everybody’s musical taste. It’s called Instant/Fogas, and it’s the most insane club I’ve ever seen. For Caro and I, this was it — the CAVES!
It has 6 (yes, 6) different rooms. On the entry floor, there are two large dance halls, one playing house music and the other playing general pop and throwback dance bangers from the likes of Madonna, Lady Gaga, Brittany, and Black Eyed Peas. The entry floor also has 4 to 5 bars, so getting a drink is no issue.
Downstairs, however, below the street, is where the complexity of Fogas can be truly celebrated. The Fogas underground features three distinct caves: heavy metal & rock, techno, and deep house. Each is separated by thick concrete and has its own bar. Being down there makes you feel incredibly edgy, but downstairs is where Fogas is the most fun. The music is great, the rooms are very spacious, and the overall vibe can’t be replicated. Granted, there are other underground bars in Budapest, but none like this. You feel the mysteriousness and grit of the city in a very unique way.
Carolina: For someone who likes to go dancing and has a Frankenstein music taste like mine, the Instant-Fogas Complex was a dream come true. However, I gotta say that there was another bar that stood out against all others. That was Viadukt, a Danube-side bar hidden underneath the trolley tracks.
During the day, the bar's green-painted metal doors are hard to distinguish from the other ones that are part of the viaduct where the trolly passes through. At night, the road becomes pedestrian-only, a black canopy tent is set up outside with a DJ playing house music sets, and tables and chairs distributed among the Danube bank. The green metal doors are wide open and the inside is decorated with an exhibition from a local artist. There's plenty of space to dance by the DJ and to sit and chat a bit further where the music isn't as loud. Regardless of where you decide to hang out, you get to enjoy the gorgeous lights of Buda across the river as well as a view of the Széchenyi Chain Bridge.
Both Viadukt and Instant-Fogas served their drinks in reusable branded plastic cups which Will and I kept. So, if we host you once we're back home, there's a chance that you might get to enjoy a drink from the cups we brought from Budapest.

This is the story of one of the least appealing things I have ever eaten. And also, of friendship. But mostly it’s about the unappealing thing. Read at your own risk.
…
You’re still here? Alright… let’s do this.
The November rain in Budapest seems to stick in the air like an impenetrable damp fog. The buildings are grandiose but muted, the people walk with their heads down, not in a hurry, but simply uninterested in their surroundings. I’ve traveled here with Garrett, a dry humored Canadian who has just come aboard the kitchen at my job in Sweden. With a week off of work, we agree to try a short trip together.
We are on the edge of town, searching for a local’s restaurant that one of us saw on some travel TV program. We’ve ridden away from the water that cuts between Buda and Pest, past the ornate museums and old sandstone buildings, and beyond the golden roofs. We are in a residential neighborhood now, drab Eastern European blocks houses, Soviet in look and feel; the sky here seems even more grey than before, the colors of the painted buildings seem a touch more muted.
We find Pléhcsárda hidden behind another small shack of a restaurant. The whole operation looks like a trailer set up in a trailer park. The dining room is a single table set up in front of the ordering window, which looks like it was made of…

Back on the rails, listening to stories and walking the ragged end of Budapest’s nineth district. To reach a nearby built-up area rather than retrace my steps through a wasteland with the occasional industrial complex I had spent the morning exploring on foot, I must cross six railway tracks with no formal crossing point. I watch a woman navigate the rails from the other side of the tracks and ask her advice about gaps in the fence there between road and rail before stepping out. With some trepidation. It is just three months since I fell down a railway embankment outside of Sofia in Bulgaria breaking my ankle and putting my Belt-Road tour from Beijing to Europe on hold as I limped back to London on crutches.
In contrast to earlier sections of the Belt-Road’s Middle Passage, many rail tracks connect Sofia, the first stop in Europe with the rest of the continent. I settle on the route through Bucharest in Romania, skirting around Belgrade in Serbia where, as in Bucharest, stories of Chinese investments suggest built, financial and social landscapes reformatted. Leaving the ground for a moment and taking a more abstract view from above, these stories boil down to minimising regulations, short-circuiting tendering processes, riding rough shod over environmental regulations, confiscating land and poor compensation: all in the rush to begin construction. Beneath these stories are cash-strapped local economies, anxious politicians and local elites eager for Chinese finance and the profits they bring while local citizens pay off the loans through their taxes and watch the disappearance of public land. Budapest fits this description too. China’s direct investment in Hungary (2023) is more than US$8 billion, by far Europe’s biggest share.
Back on the ground, the wasteland I spent the morning exploring on the ragged edge of Budapest’s nineth district is the site of China’s first university in Europe; Fudan Hungary University announced to great fanfare by both governments in 2021. I walk towards it across three and four line highways, elevated routeways made for traffic not walking and dotted with corporate offices. The BYD offices sit here along with a string of high-end car dealerships and the ‘Dream Store’ that sells bathroom fittings. BYD — which stands for Build Your Dreams — is the Chinese electric car and world-leading battery manufacturer hedging its bets on sanctions against China by setting up factories inside the EU. So far it’s Hungarian operations only makes batteries, but car factories are planned and reported to be in construction in other parts of the country.
I walk past construction sites confirming the feeling that this is one of the city’s edges, a place where Budapest is still being built. One of these has blue shipping containers stacked and creatively repurposed as housing and bathrooms for construction workers. I wander around marvelling at the use of surplus Chinese containers — trade between the two countries is asymmetrical — until a man in a high vis jacket throws me out. Next I pass the stylish white tubular athletics stadium on the edge of the area where the university is supposed to be. I can see no university, no ground being prepared, no suggestion of construction, only a large tract of scrub land in autumnal browns and yellows and an impressive derelict building that is gently falling down in the distance.
Walking further I find the exact place where the university might be but isn’t. I only know this from the street names — Dali Lama, Uyghur Martyrs, Free Hong Kong and Bishop Xi Shinguang of China’s underground Catholic Church. Krisztiana Baranyi, mayor of the nineth district, renamed the streets on which the new university would sit so as to annoy the Chinese Government and discourage the university’s construction. Popular protests erupted in 2021. Building didn’t start then and the scheme didn’t deliver a completed campus by 2024 as reports claimed it would. Optimistic news reports and announcements from both the Chinese and the Hungarian side insist that there would be five to six thousand students enrolled in shiny new buildings and five hundred staff at this outpost of China’s top tier university system by 2024. Instead there is no university; only a piece of wasteland waiting for something to happen.
Local citizens protesting the scheme object to the appropriation of city land for the education of elite students. The Budapest branch of Shanghai’s top tier university intended to charge the sort of fees most Hungarian students couldn’t afford, making it a resource only for the wealthiest. City plans earlier earmarked this area as a ‘student city’ intending it to be used to build low cost rental accommodation for students and young academics. The estimated costs of building Fudan in Budapest is in the region of E1.5 billion — more than Hungary’s Higher Education operating budget for 2019 — to be financed by a loan from China repaid by Hungarian tax payers. A Chinese contractor mired in scandal — China State Construction Engineering Corporation — would build the university using Chinese labour and materials making it hard to see the benefit for local people. Perhaps most controversially of all, delivery of this project is the responsibility of a Board of Trustees, headed by the Minister of Culture. Although there is no university and no project to manage, the Board of Trustees is paid E1.5 million a year — to date E16 million — for maintenance and operating costs on non-existent buildings despite not even having an office nor producing any activity reports (Daily News Hungary 13 August 2023).
A source close to the mayor told me that the university project hasn’t gone away, but as the Hungarian Government runs out of money it has stopped or slowed a number of expensive Chinese investment projects including the Fudan campus. Another story was offered by a taxi driver taking me to Budapest Keleti station for my train to Germany and the last stop on my Belt-Road tour. He understood that the mayor had secured permission for the athletics stadium to be built in the nineth district if the university proposal was dropped. He says that while the university project isn’t a secret, ‘no one talks about it’, although Fudan University and other Chinese projects indicate radically different directions in Budapest’s future.
Bigger stories run along these rails through Hungary too. Orbán’s Fidesz Party is desperate to attract Chinese finance, even now signing deals for factories, security systems to ‘combat terrorism’ and new railway connections to Belgrade and Budapest airport. Media reports show that Orbán’s closest local allies if not Orbán himself benefit from Chinese contracts. But the biggest story of all is geopolitical. Among many rosy statements about Chinese-Hungarian cooperation and solidarity, Xi Jinping loudly proclaims that Hungary is in China’s inner ‘circle of friends’. By this he means those countries that do the most to support China’s efforts to counter US power and influence in the world. Hungary’s rail tracks are the front line in tilting the axis of global power in China’s direction: offer a new vision for how the world might work (Financial Times 11 May 2024). This makes the rails that run through Budapest and its non-existent university a very big deal indeed.

I visited Budapest in 1990 very soon after the fall of the Iron Curtain, when the first glimmers of open gay life were just starting to show — nervous glimmers indeed compared to the astounding turnout of an estimated 200,000 people at the LGBTQ+ Pride march in the Hungarian capital on the 28th June 2025, the march expanding from a previous peak of 35,000 people as people came together in defiance of a ban put on the assembly by the Prime Minister, Viktor Orban.
In 1990 the gays in Budapest were not visible. There was a bar or two in the fashionable city centre where Spartacus, the gay guide to the world that every gay traveler kept in their backpack in those days, said gays were welcome. They were in no way gay bars — and the only club in town was in a discrete backstreet location some distance from the centre, had no signage to indicate its presence — but once inside I found a fledgling gay scene taking its first, nervous, steps. People were shy and guarded, but the music was good and we danced. I remember meeting a Russian ballet dancer. That was it. Gays were definitely not in the news. The big story in Budapest at the time was the opening of their first MacDonalds.
28th June this year was the 56th anniversary of the start of the Stonewall Riots in New York, the moment that is regarded as the kicking off point for the Gay Pride movement that emerged in the 1970s. As a direct consequence of the Hungarian government’s vindictive attack on the LGBTQ+ community, the world now sees how far the Hungarian people have come in accepting their queer brothers, sisters and children — this anniversary year may stand out in history as something like Hungary’s own Stonewall moment.
But no riot in Budapest. Despite threats to use facial recognition software and fine attendees, in the end the government directed the police to not harass participants and although they also gave permission to right wing groups to stage counter protests, nothing of any significance emerged from that. Instead a massive parade celebrating love in all its forms with attendees from 40 countries, stretched through the city. The photos and videos are incredible.
The beauty, harmony, love, peacefulness and joy on display revealed how utterly phobic and toxic the homophobic attitude of the ruling party is. The official ban was justified on the grounds of Pride being a danger to children — which simply reveals the dark minds of those proposing the ban, who are actually projecting their own dark thoughts onto gay people when they see us as sexual deviants and predators. Pride is not about sex, it’s about freedom — and knowing that, many heterosexuals walked in the march too.
Hungary is not the only eastern European country in which right wing politicians are stoking public debate about gay and trans people to fire up their base and to distract from anti-democratic legislation which they are pushing through their parliaments. It’s happening in Slovenia too. And some might say there’s signs of the same in the UK.
Pride is a Freedom March.
A Protest. A Declaration of Power.
Pride is Love In Action.

Budapest was such an awesome city! Although not at the very top, it comes a very close second! It is very open and spread out, yet it still had its nooks and crannies to get lost in. The city reminded us of Brooklyn in NY, it had a trendy/hipster feel with a lot of young people. The nightlife was outrageous, with tons of restaurants to eat at and bars to socialize in, for all sorts of tastes. There were parks to lay around in or many shopping streets to keep you busy. There is something for everyone in Budapest… except a beach which is why Barcelona is still our favorite city visited so far.
Budapest has 23 districts and they are usually indicated by Roman numerals. The more central districts, like downtown, have lower numbers while the outer districts have higher numbers. The best districts to stay in are district V and VI as within these 2 districts you can find a lot of the major landmarks & attractions, along with the widest selection of restaurants, cafes, pubs and bars. Most, if not all, are walkable. We barely used the Metro system but it was very easy to navigate when necessary.
There were countless accommodation options in Budapest especially a huge range of hostels. Booking the day before still allowed us over 40+ hostels to choose from. We ended up staying at 11th Hour Hostel and Cinema which was located right in the middle of downtown. Some other popular hostels in a great location are Wombats, Big Fish, Downtown Oasis, Maverick City Lodge.
Szechenyi Baths and Pool — One of the largest spa complexes of its kind in Europe. The entry ticket is (5000 HUF/ 16 €) which includes the usage of a change room, locker, multiple different pools, saunas, steam rooms and fitness centre. We spent a couple of hours here relaxing in the pools & sweating it up in the saunas. Note: bring your own towel & lunch as there isn’t a large selection of food!
Conquer Budapest Walking tour visiting St Stephen Basilica, Matthias Church, Danube Promenade, Chain Bridge, National Opera House, Castle District (Royal Palace, Matthias Church, Fisherman Bastion). Our guide for this was one of our favourites of our Europe trip so far and we’ve done a lot of ‘free walking tours’. The tour was never boring even though we are slowly but surely getting tired of churches and history, he kept it interesting and fun for the whole 3 hours. The Fisherman Bastion is shown below.
Central Market Hall- A 3 story hall combing shopping and eating. Fresh fruit and vegetable stalls, meats, cheeses, souvenirs, shopping and most importantly a selection of food stalls with portions bigger than you can ever imagine. Classic Hungarian dishes are sold here but come hungry and forget trying to count calories.
Vaci Utca — Vaci Utca is one of the main shopping streets in Budapest and also a very popular tourist drag. The street is lined with cute cafes, great shops and a tonne of Thai massage parlours which we indulged in (do shop around).
Margaret Island — A 2.5km long central island laying in between “buda” and “pest”. A very well kept island with ample to do during the summer months. It’s a beautiful spot to spend an afternoon during the spring/summer. The island has a pool, water park, wildlife park & athletic centre. We strolled here from downtown Budapest or you can take the number 26 bus which is the only vehicle allowed on the island.
Gellert Hill — Panoramic views over Budapest. You can climb the Gellért Hill starting at the Elisabeth Bridge near the Gellért Monument, or you can take the steeper route starting at the Gellért Hotel. You can also take a bus or get there by taxi.
Eating in Budapest was a welcomed treat after indulging in so much pasta and pizza in Italy. Hungary had their typical cuisine but also every other type, so there was never too much repeating. It was cheap, the portions were often of a good size and there were countless restaurants to choose from.
Street food is also very common and convenient in Budapest. At Karavan you can find numerous food trucks in this little outdoor area. Perfect for a quick dinner or a late night snack after spending time at the famous ruin bar, Szimpla Kert.
Below is a list of the typical Hungarian dishes you should try if you are to visit the city! And before you finish, don’t be alarmed when we mention that we did eat all of them.. a few times.
You can easily sample all of these on your own throughout the city but if you enjoy food tours then we suggest signing up for one of the many tours Taste Hungary has to offer.
Hungarians typically eat their biggest meal during lunch so many restaurants offer a “Tourist Menu” which involves a three-course meal for less than $6 (100 HUF), this is often cheaper than ordering just one dish. However, when we weren’t eating a 3-course meal, you could find us at some of our other favourite restaurants:
Bors Gasztrobar — Always a line, freshly made baguette sandwiches, homemade soups & cheap cheap!Drum Cafe — Cheap, classic Hungarian food.Fruccola — Healthy, fresh, create your own salads/sandwiches.Magyar — Classic 3 course restaurant with generous portions. Close to the Grand Central Market but surprisingly not a tourist trap as we had first thought.
Just like restaurants, the nightlife options are endless and generally are within walking distance. We weren’t in Budapest over the weekend but each night had something going on.
Some of you may be aware of what a “Ruin Bar” is, some not… well Budapest is famous for these types of bars. It is simply a bar/pub, inside or next to an old building. The buildings have usually been abandoned and turned into bars by decorating them with many different types of objects, such as paper statues, foreign licence plates, unique lanterns and seats made from cushions, old cars, duck tape, you name it. If you use your imagination you can usually get a picture for what they look like. None of the interior makes sense and generally doesn’t have a theme except looking like ‘designed junk’. If the walls aren’t covered with pictures and objects then they are painted.
Some of the most popular Ruin bars in Budapest are Szimpla Kert, Grandio, Instant, Yellow Zebra Bikes & Bar and Anker’T. If you have to go to only one, make it Szimpla Kert! So much fun and so unique. It’s open during the day, so you can get a better look at the interior. Grandio is a hostel as well as a bar so don’t stay here if you’re wanting to sleep!
Gozsdu Courtyard is another popular area in downtown. Although they aren’t ruin bars, the courtyard/long street has a variety of beer gardens and restaurants and is both popular with locals and tourists. Check out Spiler, one of the biggest restaurants in the area with a solid menu both for food and drinks. The lamb burger was super tasty & recommended.
We were really sad to leave Budapest but until next time…..

A Peek Inside The House of Terror — One of Budapest’s Most Notorious and Frightening Museums,https://articlesbypauletteklein.medium.com/a-peek-inside-the-house-of-terror-one-of-budapests-most-notorious-and-frightening-museums-e0249b4156d8,"Sign up

The Terror Museum isn’t your run-of-the-mill macabre haunted house type museum meant to temporarily scare you like a Hollywood movie. Instead, the terrors that took place inside this building are real, carried out by two separate regimes spanning from World War II to the Soviet communist area by their secret police.
The Terror Museum is located on the beautiful Andrassy Utca, one of Budapest’s most elegant boulevards with lush shady trees, stately apartment buildings, and high-end designer boutiques. This upscale bustling area of Budapest also has a dark and storied past. Nestled among the buildings on this posh street is where visitors will find the museum, which is one of Budapest’s most notorious and frightening buildings.
As I approached the entrance to the museum, I was struck with a surreal sensation knowing that this beautiful building was once the headquarters to both the Hungarian Arrow Cross Party (Hungary’s Nazi Party) and AVO/AVH Communist Terrorist Organizations. The building, if not for the iron platform with the words “Terror” adorning its roof, was a beautiful example baroque architecture and the words did little to prepare me for the history of horror that awaited me just beyond the entrance doors.
Before entering the museum I took some time to admire a piece of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain Memorial, a chain sculpture reminding visitors of the city’s dark history during Soviet rule.
The ground floor of the museum consists of the lobby, cafe, cloakroom, restrooms, and ticket counter. After passing through the ticket admission turnstile, I entered a 3-story courtyard that houses a Soviet tank sitting in a reflection pool and a gallery that showcases a haunting display of hundreds of black and white photographs of Hungarians who were the victims of the communist terror organizations.
The museum’s tour began on the 3rd floor where a labyrinth of exhibits guided me through the history of the building’s infamous past; starting with the story of the rise of the Hungarian Nazis (The Arrow Cross Party), the end of the Nazi regime, rise of communism in Hungary, and the resistance. The displays are a fascinating look at how the atrocities of terror organizations impacted the lives of the citizens of Budapest.
After passing through the exhibits of the top floor, the tour descends down a spiral staircase to the 2nd floor. Here I had an opportunity to learn about the history of the AVO/AVH terror organizations and the practices of their secret police. The exhibits feature communist propaganda, the life of people living under communism, the offices of the Gabor Peter, the Head of the Hungarian Political Police, as well as other exhibits to help one understand the terrors the citizens faced during this bleak and dangerous time in history.
From the museum’s second floor, I entered the elevator where the tour’s darkest part was about to take place. Learning about the history of terrors that took place was truly tragic, but what was hidden below in the building’s basement was even more terrifyingly evil.
As I made my way through a through a maze of dungeonous prison cells, interrogation rooms complete with the original torture equipment, execution rooms, and the heart-wrenching Hall of Tears featuring lit crosses in remembrance of the victims whose lives ended here, I was left shaken. Imaging the terror the victims must have felt as they endured days spent subject to horrific torture and worse in these cold grey stone walls was a bit overwhelming, to say the least.
As I exited the tour and stepped back out into the bright daylight and onto Andrassy Utca, my mind was still trying to process the evil that humans can do to one another. It was one of the museums that I wished didn’t exist, but believe must be visited in order to understand that the dark times of history should never be repeated. It was a museum that I will never forget.
The Terror Haus is one of the most powerfully moving museums in Europe and one that needs to be on your Budapest itinerary. The museum is open Tuesday to Sunday, 10:00 am to 6:00 pm and is located at 60 Andrassy Boulevard.

We exited Szimpla Kert and stepped out into the dark, rustic alleys of Budapest. The fragrant fall air of late October brought hints of change, and this once-ruined city at night gave the impression we were traveling in another world.
While walking the streets in that state of traveler’s bliss, we joked about the twists of fate that had brought the two of us to this place, still buzzing on the beers we had shared in a vintage bathtub in the maze that was the ruin bar we had just left.
As we passed through the alley, a figure moving against the crowd was nonchalantly listing out choice substances to no one in particular, not-so-subtly soliciting interest.
The indulgences of the night had lulled me to let my guard down, and so I thought nothing of her flagging the guy down in the crowded street, and inquiring about the availability of some grass. There were two of us, and just this one man, so what risk was there?
As they conducted a transaction in hushed words, I felt no cause for alarm. My friend was confident in these kinds of situations and…

Budapest is renown for its spas — even the zoo has one, with many animals having their own thermal baths (and, apparently, a very high reproductive rate). On a glorious spring day I stood outside the belle epoch Széchenyi Baths, the phrases ‘taking the waters’ and ‘frequented by royalty’ running through my mind. Even the entrance to the baths was a work of wonder.
Inside was all high ceilings and chandeliers. An authoritarian attendant ushered me into a small change room, returning later to lock my clothes away. I shared my change room with half a dozen others — this was no place for false modesty.
And so, to the waters. Outside were two enormous baths (one at 30 degrees C, the other at 34) with a lap pool between them. Inside were another 15 or so baths, each catering to different needs.

December 29, 2024
When you first step into a new city, the vibe tells you a lot. Specially, when you go in without much research, like we did for this one. So, stepping into Budapest after the loud and lively Vienna felt like entering a quieter, more mysterious world. As we climbed up the escalator from the train station, the crisp cold air hit our faces, and the glowing Liberty Bridge appeared in the distance arching over Danube. It was a quiet welcome, and something about it felt right. Calm and inviting — that was our first taste of Budapest.
The walk to our hotel was an easy 10 minutes. Although, in -2°C, dragging suitcases, while our fingers and nose slowly froze, we couldn’t help but admire the streets. That moment, in a way, set the tone for the rest of the trip: embracing the unexpected and finding joy in the little things. My North Face jacket and Alaska-grade boots were doing their job, but Dev, who’s always “too cool for layers,” was clearly questioning his decisions. The streets were quiet, dimly lit, and peaceful — a stark contrast to where we had come from. Tired but content, something about the city felt quietly intriguing.
December 30, 2024
Day 1: When Things Don’t Go as Planned
The next morning, we woke up later than usual. Laundry was the first task of the day — a necessity for anyone packing light on long trips. We tried this for the first time last year during our trip to France and Spain, and it was a game changer. We found a laundromat nearby and got our oat milk lattes while waiting for the cycles to finish. It was a slow start, but it felt good to take our time. Given our type A personalities of always being on the go — Dev, especially — and me being a mix of high-energy and sometimes slowing down, we’ve both been trying to deliberately pace ourselves. This trip somehow made it easier, as if the city’s vibe gently nudged us to slow down and be present. It even tied into my New Year’s resolution. How? I am not going to spoil it for you! You’ll find out towards the end.
Then came breakfast — or rather, the search for it. Most places were closed for the holidays, and Google’s “open now” wasn’t exactly reliable. Isn’t it funny how we still trust Google blindly, even after so many travel time fails? No? Just us? Anyway, we ended up wandering aimlessly for what felt like forever, hangry. Finally, we stumbled upon Napfényes Restaurant and Confectionery, a vegan Hungarian spot. We had vegan versions of authentic Hungarian food, including vegan goulash. The desserts were the real winners: a sponge cake that reminded me of tiramisu and soy yogurt “cottage cheese” balls. We devoured it! When sharing dessert somehow we eat faster! No? Again, Just us?! 😲
We enjoyed a long brunch and by the time we were done it was already noon, so with no specific plans for the day, we decided to just walk along the Danube. The river stretched out, with the Buda Castle standing tall in the backdrop— it was mesmerizing.
While I posed at multiple locations by the river and Dev happily played photographer, a guy proposed to his girlfriend right next to us. I was so in the moment that I missed their moment and realized it when I saw people congratulating them. (You’ll see the exact moment I finally saw it in the picture below) I was so bummed that I missed it, but it also made us feel so warm and happy to see the happy couple! Also, I didn’t forget the usual:
Me: “You never proposed to me like that.”
Dev: “I’ve been on my knees ever since.”
Dude’s got lines!
The foggy walk along the river was really romantic, which explains the proposal as well. It’s an amazing spot to propose — if that’s something you’re considering. Notice the bench, that’s where you can pretend to take a picture from behind while the other person faces the river. Perfect moment to get on your knees. Good luck!
I took this picture of Dev on that same spot before the proposal happened.
As we moved along, we saw a street vendor mulling wine on the side of the road. Unlike the machine-made ones in Vienna, this one was simmering on a stove. We grabbed some, and Dev downed his so fast he claimed, “Fefde jal gaye” (burnt my insides). But it warmed us up perfectly for the evening.
Continuing our walk, we came across the Jewish Memorial — iron shoes lined up along the riverbank. These shoes commemorate the Jews tragically executed during World War II at this very spot. It’s a haunting and humbling reminder of history’s darker moments.
Hungarian Parliament
From there, we turned right and saw it — the Hungarian Parliament — a jaw-dropping masterpiece of architecture. It’s one of the most stunning buildings we’ve ever seen! I had heard it’s even better from the inside, but we didn’t have tickets, and it was sold out due to holidays on that day. So we happily admired the exteriors of this exquisite detailed gothic and renaissance gem! Of course, this meant photos galore. Dev quipped, “Seriously, itni photos li hain ki Parliament Sharma gaya!” (We clicked so many pictures that the Parliament itself got shy!)
After all that, we decided to take a coffee break but we realized we were completely coffee-d out! So, I ordered water — because, fun fact, Europe and dehydration seem to go hand in hand for me. Unless I’m super intentional about drinking water, I always end up forgetting to hydrate. Quick tip: Make sure you sip a lot of water while traveling! Over Dev’s chai latte with oat milk, water, some vegan Lindt chocolate, and some more geeking out over architecture history, we enjoyed the lit up view of the parliament. Dev after over 10 years of being married to an architect is pretty caught up with his architectural history!
Honestly, these little pauses are becoming some of our favorite moments. ❤️
Evening Adventures: Ruin Bars and New Friends
After that, wondering what to do next, we decided to explore a street nearby called Andrassy Ut. After walking that street, we found a small vegan restaurant tucked in a basement. At first glance, we were hesitant, but the cozy, homely vibe inside won us over. The place was run by a mother-daughter duo, with the mother cooking in an open kitchen and the daughter managing everything else. I tried vegan cottage cheese pasta, while Dev had a burger. They were out of their vegan Hungarian goulash, much to my disappointment. After enjoying our meal, we left chatting and laughing, only to realize ten minutes later that our handbag was missing! Dev sprinted back to the restaurant and thankfully , we retrieved it without issue and after some deliberation decided to head to the Jewish Ruin Bars, a must-visit in Budapest. These bars, created in abandoned Jewish factories post-World War II, are now vibrant spots of nightlife. There, we ran into an Indian couple living in the UK and had such a great time talking that we completely lost track of time. By 11 PM — a late night for us — we realized how much fun we’d had and how unexpectedly we ended up celebrating what felt like an early New Year’s Eve with newfound friends. Moments like these truly make travel special!
December 31, 2024
Day 2: Lost and Found on Gellért Hill
We started our day nice and slow, waking up around 10 AM. After getting ready, we headed to Buda for the first time, curious to see what it was all about. Our main stop? The St. Gerard Sagredo Statue on Gellért Hill. Now, this place has quite a story — turns out St. Gerard was a priest who was thrown off the hill for his beliefs. Pretty tragic, but hey, now he’s got this massive statue and a hill named after him. Goes to show, if you stay true to yourself, you can leave a lasting mark on the world. The views from up there? Totally worth the climb. The winding roads to get there — foggy and lined with leafless dark trees — felt straight out of a movie.
From the statue, I got it into my head that we needed to explore more of the hill. I wanted to see the Liberty Statue, Hungary’s version of the Statue of Liberty, perched somewhere higher up in the mountain. So, off we went, walking past fancy mansions and more winding roads. We somehow found ourselves passing the Saudi Arabia Embassy and even saw a mansion that had once belonged to a wealthy family but was sold due to tragedy and is now a museum, I think. It felt like a little adventure in our quest to find the Liberty Statue. Maybe it was the fog, or maybe it was the construction happening around the castle at the top, but we didn’t find the statue.
Eventually, what we did find, was a cozy café called Füge Shop and Café. We sat down, sipped hot coffee, and just chilled for a bit!
As the evening rolled in, we crossed the bridge from Buda back to Pest for our boat tour on the Danube. If you want to see Budapest in all its glory, this is the way to do it. The Parliament and Buda Castle lit up at night? Stunning. If I may get poetic — the Parliament glowed like a golden crown against the night sky, its reflection shimmering in the Danube — a sight to remember. Nothing could stop us from stepping out of the heated seating area onto the deck for better views, and wow, it was worth it. A flock of shadowy black birds danced against the Parliament’s glowing backdrop, the chill of the air felt nice, and the Danube looked majestic as ever. It was one of those quiet, perfect moments for Dev and me, just soaking it all in. Oh, and let’s not forget the Spanish group of revelers who at that moment asked me to take their group shot. I obliged, and my iPhone .5 shot skills made them so happy! It was all happening.
After the hour-long tour, we walked back to our hotel for a quiet New Year’s Eve. Leftovers, packaged dal from Costco (warmed up by the hotel staff, pro move, right? Which the hotel manager noticed and told us, Hungarian tradition says if you eat lentils on new years eve you will have immense wealth the next year, well, we’ll take that!) some snacks, a complimentary bottle of wine from the hotel, video calls with family, some Bollywood party music, a little dancing, and just enjoying each other’s company.
New Years Day — Jan 01, 2025
Day 3: Vampires, Witches, and Spooky Stories
Waking up on the first of January, the first thing that popped into my head was my New Year’s resolution: spend less time on social media. Over the past year, I’d realized I’d developed a bit of an addiction to scrolling. Sure, I love sharing travel pictures for many reasons, but it started to feel counterproductive. (We’ll save that discussion for another day!) So, before I slept on New Year’s Eve, I boldly deleted my Instagram app.
Fast forward to the next morning — I woke up feeling good but immediately wanted to reinstall the app. Classic, right? But guess what? The universe was on my side because I couldn’t log back in! Logging in from Budapest locked me out, and I didn’t remember my password. Taking this as a sign from the stars, I decided to roll with it.
I shared this with Dev over breakfast, and he confessed he could also do with less Reddit and LinkedIn time. Boom — joint New Year’s resolution made! Feeling all kinds of inspired, we got ready and stepped out into a cloudy, rainy Budapest winter.
Eating out on New Year’s Day is tricky. Most places are closed, and the ones that are open are usually packed. Our first stop was a café, but the only vegan option was, literally, a freezing spirulina beach bowl. So we moved on. Eventually, we stumbled upon a fancy Michelin-starred restaurant. It wasn’t entirely vegan, but hey, it sounded like a New Year’s treat. And it was super fancy — the server unfolded my napkin and placed it on my lap. Not the most comfortable I’ve been in a moment!
I ordered a delicious spinach salad with tofu, while Dev went for an acai bowl and fries (the only other vegan options). Oh, and the breads were vegan and delicious. The food was top-notch, and we felt fancy AF starting our year like this. Again, not planned at all!
Next up was Buda Castle, sitting pretty on a hill. Armed with layers of clothing and our enthusiasm, we started the climb — stairs and all. The view from the top was stunning, but man, it was freezing!
Once we reached the castle, we saw massive lines for the museum and ticket counters. After a quick debate, we decided to skip the museum. Why? Because we wanted to be more intentional with our time. Instead of rushing through, we chose to go back to our hotel, relax, and recharge for our evening plans. So unlike us, right? I think it’s all about fighting the FOMO!
Back at the hotel, we couldn’t distract ourselves with our phones (thanks to the new resolution), so we turned on the TV. To our delight, there was an orchestra performance playing — it felt oddly perfect for the day. We snacked on leftovers, took a quick nap, and felt recharged for the evening.
Our evening began with street food (yes, pav bhaji in Budapest!) before heading out for our walking tour. We took a quick stroll around the winter market and the giant Ferris wheel, which had completely baffled me earlier. The blue glow it cast on the sky behind the buildings had left me wondering where it was coming from — until I finally saw the Ferris wheel and it all made sense.
Eastern Europe has a rich history of eerie tales, and this walking tour was a deep dive into them. We learned about Vlad the Impaler, the Romanian ruler who gruesomely killed his enemies. Vlad was later captured by a Hungarian emperor and imprisoned under Buda Castle. This gruesome history inspired the vampire legends we know today, including Dracula!
The craziest part? As our tour guide was dramatically recounting this story, a bystander — Romanian, of course — who was not at all happy about the story, interrupted to say Vlad wasn’t that bad. Who’s to say? Maybe we’ll have to visit Romania to find out. New trip idea alert?
Then there was the story of the Crying Widow, a woman who allegedly ran a hospital in her basement but used the blood of young girls to maintain her beauty. Oh, and another witch apparently ate children straight out of their graves. 😱. By the end of the tour, we were thoroughly spooked — especially since we had to walk down the castle hill alone.
We grabbed a cab back to the hotel that was 5 minute drive away. Not because it was late at night and we were spooked, duh!, only because we had an early start the next day. 😅
That night, we packed up and got ready for our early morning train to Bratislava.
Final Thoughts
Budapest wasn’t what we expected, because we didn’t really know what to expect. It was better. From wandering aimlessly to stumbling upon cozy cafés, and from Gothic architecture debates to spooky vampire tales, every unplanned moment added a layer to our journey. It reminded us that sometimes, letting go of plans is the best way to truly experience a place. The unplanned moments — getting lost, discovering hidden gems, and letting go of rigid plans — made it unforgettable. Sometimes, the best travel stories aren’t the ones you plan. They’re the ones that find you.

Our complete running guide to Budapest is now on the Great Runs site. Below is a quick summary.
Budapest, Hungary is a wonderful city for traveling, with wonderfully preserved architecture, great restaurants and bars, and a good transport infrastructure. It is the capital of Hungary and the country’s largest city, with a population of 3.3 million. There are lots of great places to go running in Budapest.
The best places to run in Budapest are all centrally located. The highlight is Margaret Island, a recreational mecca with several km of trails with great river and city views. There is also excellent running along the Danube, on both sides, although one should look carefully at our guide to learn the best sections. There are also some great parks for running: City Park (Varosliget), Bikás Park, and Orczy Park. And for some hills, head to Gellért Hill in Buda and run up to the Citudella (fort), or enjoy the more expansive Normafa park, a few km west of the city. One thing that’s unique about running in Budapest is that there are many places with rubberized running tracks, which are dedicated paths for runners. The longest is 5.3 km on Margaret Island. Many of these tracks also feature an open air fitness park, with machines for exercising.
Our full guide to running in Budapest is on the Great Runs site. Click on the links to each of these routes for full description and maps.

I created a video about Budapest, Hungary’s capital, for the “Connecting cities” project. I took these photos while I was with the Erasmus program there, and I wanted to share with you my once in a lifetime experience! Enjoy! #connectingCities
Last year I was given the opportunity to participate in the Erasmus program. The city I was chosen to go was Budapest. As a student there I made a lot of friends, with most of them coming from other countries and cultures. As you can imagine, I broadened my horizons, I shifted my perspective about a variety of things and, as a result, I changed a lot about my way of thinking. My stay abroad was for one academic semester (about 6 months), where I was a student at Karoli Gaspar University! In particular, Erasmus is actually an exchange program between European Universities, in which students from European countries connect, collaborate and share their feelings and ideas with each other, while studying in a foreign country. In this way, students become more open-minded and self-confident.
Now, its time for me to show you some of the main attractions that Budapest is famous for, including what I felt and what I thought while being there. Also, I will try to make a comparison of these attractions to the Greek culture and natural heritage, trying to find out the similarities between these two ostensibly different countries, Hungary and Greece.
To begin with, one of the most famous attractions in Budapest, and Hungary in general, is the Danube river. While gazing the Danube river and its calm waves, I surely admired the serenity and the beauty of Hungary’s nature. It is such a nice place, where there are a lot of small kiosks, coffee shops and restaurants, in which you can enjoy this breathtaking landscape and view. It is definitely a place where even your deepest thoughts can be unfolded. Once, while I was drinking my cup of hot chocolate during a boat cruise through the river, it felt like I was in a sailing boat into the Aegean sea. Instantly, the lyrics of Randy Newman’s song came across my mind… ‘’I am looking at the river but I am thinking of the sea’’. Many feelings passed through me and along with this, the sense of nostalgia of the sea and my country made me feel that I am into the Aegean again.
It is said that one of the best known attractions of Budapest is “The Fisherman’s Bastion”, which was built in the 19th century. The Bastion is a castle named after the guild of fishermen that was responsible for defending the stretch of the city walls in the Middle Ages. At this time, it is a city viewing terrace, with a lot of stairs and walking paths, and serves the best panoramic view in Budapest! It is a spot that many tourists visit, in order to take amazing photos of the view and, of course, themselves, for remembering their holidays! Needless to say, the architectural style and placement of the castle makes you feel like you are a part of a fairy tale, by taking you back in time, especially in the wintertime.
When I started finding out more about the city, I discovered that, not only the close to Danube side of Budapest is amazing, but also the other districts both Buda and Pest. For example, there is an enormous square called ‘’Heroes square’’ in which huge buildings and monuments are exhibited. I recall that a guide was telling us once the detailed history of the square, and we were all amazed about how similar the Greek and Hungarian architecture was. For instance, the Museum’s of Fine Arts designers were inspired by the ancient temples of Greece, and that’s why the front of the building is classical with massive Corinthian columns. Apart from that, its exhibitions contain pieces of art from Ancient Greece and Rome, which is something that made me feel really proud.
In my opinion, Budapest is definitely a suitable place for traveling, but only someone who lives there can ascertain how the everyday life and behavior of its local citizens is. As a student there, sometimes I had reservations about some specific things, such as not being accompanied while walking home. But that’s an apprehension I would have in any city that I am not familiar with. In general, Budapest is considered an overcrowded city and people there are kind-hearten and open-minded, such as many Greeks are.
If you go to the city center of Budapest during the Christmas time, you will find small wooden houses selling traditional Hungarian, sweets, food and art, and everything smells cinnamon and coconut. Its typically called the “Christmas Market” and you will surely have a blast while being there!
While spending 6 months there, I tried to taste all kinds of different traditional Hungarian food. My main conclusion was that their recipes were similar with the Greek ones, but Hungarians use more spices and bigger amounts of garlic and onion. As an example to the above, both Hungary and Greece have a traditional recipe for stuffed peppers. In Greece this recipe is called ‘’Gemista’’, and apart from peppers, stuffed tomatoes and other vegetables may also be included. In Hungary, its called ‘’Töltött paprika’’ and, by default, there are only stuffed peppers included. In Greece, “Gemista” is stuffed with minced meat, rice, garlic, tomato sauce, onions and oil olive while in Hungary, it is stuffed with pork, rice, onion, garlic, paprika and tomato sauce. So, you can imagine how similar these recipes are to each other, despite the small differences that may occur.
Additionally, I need to write about the baroque style that characterizes Budapest. While walking around the city, the roads and the buildings make you feel like you are starring in a mystery movie! Most of European countries are conducted with this architectural style, which is why they are considered to be so “unique” and “special” compared to other countries. In Budapest, you will notice these buildings of Baroque architecture mainly in the castle district, but also in the Szechenyi Thermal baths, the Royal palace and St. Anna’s Church. This style makes the city an absolute architectural paradise!
Now days, there is a situation which many countries are facing, mainly due to the financial crisis that hit the European Union. Unfortunately, in both Budapest and Athens, are a lot of homeless people and their number is constantly being increased. Most of them are living in subway stations, underpasses, parks and areas with high criminality rates. A high percentage of them are drug addicts and alcoholics. The problem in both Budapest and Athens is that there aren’t enough shelters that can provide a descent place to live to those who can’t afford it. So, inevitably, they end up living in the streets. For example, as a solution to this unfortunate situation, the City Hall of Athens is planning to open an overnight shelter for the capital’s homeless, but this kind of plan needs a lot of effort and time to be invested in order to be successful soon enough.In conclusion, we realize that these two cities, Budapest and Athens, have come to deal with poverty due to all the problems caused by the financial crisis. As a case in point, the high level of unemployment was a fatal factor for the loss of many homes, which led to the increased number of homeless people all around the county.
If you are a new Erasmus student, don’t worry, you will quickly make a lot new friends from a bunch of different countries! Erasmus students are very friendly and open to new friendships and experiences. I remember the very first course where we got to meet each other. That course was the Hungarian language one, and my first thought about it was that the difficulty was pretty much the same as the Greek one. All the Erasmus students were joking about the difficulty of the language, and how we could cope with it. We couldn’t even pronounce the words in the right way! It’s really hard to speak Hungarian fluently…
Fortunately, 6 months are enough to find out a lot of hints about living in Budapest, and of course to get along with them too. I have to admit that I am really glad about choosing Budapest as my Erasmus destination. I gained a lot of experiences, felt a lot of emotions and I had the chance to bond with so many people from around the world! I strongly believe that if it wasn’t for Budapest, I wouldn’t be able to understand how much my country relates or differentiates with another one, or how identical or opposite it can be in various aspects! I would definitely not change a thing!

Yes, for sure!!
Budapest is one of the most beautiful, vibrant, and dynamic cities in the country of Hungary. It is the combination of two regions i.e., Buda — A hilly area, and Pest — A flat area, divided by the Danube River in centre.
The Hungarian capital has extremely exceptional sights on both banks of the Danube, a history of over 2000 years, vivid culture, and appetizing delicacies.
Everything you MUST know about the experiences here is as below:
This is one of the most architecturally spectacular and sacred buildings in the city located in the Pest region.
The St. Stephen Square in front of the basilica will give you a whole different feeling during the winters and summers as it comprises of Christmas market and terraces with parasols respectively.
The Basilica consists of a beautifully ornamented interior with statues, mosaics, murals, paintings, and stained glass which will surely amaze you about its history.

We arrived in Budapest after traveling for twenty-two hours. We were tired.
My husband and I were new to river cruising and decided to get our feet wet with what some call the grand-daddy of Viking cruises — The Grand European Tour.
This cruise would take us from Budapest to Amsterdam over two weeks on the Danube, Main, and Rhine Rivers through the heart of Europe. We had no idea what to expect on our first night.
Before dinner, I asked if my husband could walk through Budapest with me across the famous Chain Bridge. I knew he was tired, but for me — he said yes. I had explained that we’d be departing the next evening before the city was lit and I wanted to get some photographs.
I’m blessed with an adoring and amenable husband. He knows one of my life’s greatest pleasures is taking photographs—especially on a trip.
When we left the ship, we weren’t ready for the beauty of Budapest at night. This walk over the Chain Bridge from Pest to Buda, on that first night, is one of my favorite and most beautiful parts of our European river cruise vacation.

Will: We arrived in Budapest extremely hungry (see what I did there?). After disembarking from another lovely Flixbus trip, it was time to find our next home away from home.
Our Air BnB is in a popular area of the city called Oktogon. It’s a lively section of town full of restaurants, bars, shops, hotels, and grocery stores. We had no issues checking into our Air Bnb, and after a brief respite, it was time for dinner. Using our trusty dusty Happy Cow app we found a Mediterranean restaurant cheffing up some amazing salad bowls. Tucked in the Jewish Quarter, the owners welcomed us with big smiles and loaded us up with some felafel balls atop a bed of quinoa, salad greens, beats, and hummus. Post dinner we considered joining the masses in having a few drinks, but the travel day wore us out more than we anticipated. No need to rush it — we’ll be here all month!
Sunday was a settling-in type of day, and we had a mission.
Acquainting yourself with a brand-new city is fun in many ways; we’re learning to see its joy instead of overwhelming ourselves. Google Maps has become our best friend, and finding the most informative local blogs online has become a refined skill.
It might not seem like a real skill, but there are plenty of opportunities to be led astray when relying on the internet.
Carolina: As I'm writing this 22 days after ""moving"" to Budapest, I forget exactly the order of happenings for this day. But, as Will mentioned, we had some missions for Sunday.
For groceries, we gravitated towards Spar since that's the grocery chain we grew accustomed to in Zagreb. However, the Spar location near us wasn't the greatest — the quality of the veggies and variety was subpar, same could be said for their selection of vegan proteins, coffee, milk, and pasta. In the coming days we discovered that just across the street, there was a small local grocery chain (G Roby) that had everything we needed and more.
For the gym, we decided to tour a few spots. First, Nr1 Fitness — a 24/7 gym inside of what seemed to be an office building. As we walked in, we encountered a receptionist who, in broken English, told us that the gym was independent of the offices so she didn't have access to it. We decided to go check it out anyway behind the glass doors. As we did, two gym members came into the building and as they unlocked the doors to the gym, we slipped in with them.
The gym was small but not busy. It was a bit warm but it had everything we were looking for — ""It will be a good sweat session, kind of like hot yoga"" we told each other.
We then walked to 4% Fitness Corner — which is exactly what you would expect from a Budapest gym. House music booming through the speakers, cage-like room dividers, and muscle tees everywhere. It was only $10 extra than the other gym but there was more space, more machines, and the AC worked.
After touring the gyms, we decided to grab lunch and weigh our options. We walked to Kozmosz, an underground restaurant that serves vegan versions of traditional Hungarian dishes. Over chocolate-covered layered cake and coffee, we re-read the reviews for Nr1 and 4% and found out that many people had a hard time canceling their membership with Nr1, asking for a cancelation, still being charged, and not being able to get their money back. Now that's a problem we don't want to have. As we had discovered from our tours, 4% accepted cash payments. Additionally, there were no complaints of scammy business practices.
On the following day, we showed up at 4% and paid a month's worth of cash membership. And just like that, we had a gym.
Will: But what about when you’re suffering from screen fatigue? What is a way to explore a city without a phone? Caro and I have found going for a run works brilliantly.
Carolina: Going on casual runs has to be one of my favorite ways to explore somewhere. I say ""casual"" because the main objective of these runs isn't to hit a specific distance or keep at a certain pace. The objective is to go somewhere you've never been and see new things. To take the the byway just to see what it leads to. In these runs, it's more than okay to stop to take in the scenery, as the objective isn't to run.
That's how we decided to spend our first Sunday evening in Budapest. We ran up the street that connects Oktogon to the Budapest City Park — Andrássy út. Passing by gorgeous buildings such as HAB (Hungarian Art and Business), and the Alice Hotel. To reach the park, we ran around Hero's Square where we got a gorgeous view of the sunset (see picture below).
At the park, we ran aimlessly, allowing ourselves to get lost in the network of trails and pathways that cut through the park. At some point, we found ourselves at a Wine & Food festival (typical) in the shadows of the Vajdahunyad Castle. We also explored the park's extensive recreational sports infrastructures, and of course, the Széchenyi Thermal Bath.
On our way back, passing through the Hero's Square once again, we came across a Star Wars meet-up, over 200 people holding blue and red lightsabers. It was truly a sight to be seen.
Arriving back at Oktogon, we were lured into a local Pizza chain by the smell of baked dough, tomato sauce, and cheese. To my content, they had a veggie pizza option with no cheese. So we wrapped up another wholesome day with 2 slices of cheese-less pizza.

“Is it Paris or is it communist Russia? Who knows?!” Colin Hanks
These days, thanks to lower wages and a lower cost of living — and studio heads’ need for more money — there’s a lot of Hollywood production in Hungary. On any given night, some celebrity or muckety-muck can be found sipping palinka at the Four Seasons Hotel bar or wandering along the Danube. I’m here because my husband is working on a television show, our apartment’s Apple TV still has Eddie Redmayne’s login info and I know what Colin Hanks said about Budapest because my friend ran into him here, he was nice, they chatted, he described this place perfectly.
The comparison to Paris is obvious: classic pre-war buildings on either side of a glorious river spanned by majestic bridges. Communism lingers in the depressing grey concrete buildings shoved between old elegant ones and the unsmiling faces seen on the street.
But when I heard this quote, my first thought wasn’t architecture or national character, it was bread. Budapest’s bread and pastries are — for real — better than bread and pastries in Paris.
I swear. But just in case my taste buds or memory had gone awry, I went to Paris to test my hypothesis. Any excuse to mow down more flour, sugar and butter than any…

I knew the Danube River and Hungary at a very young age because of piano — Johann Strauss’s “The Blue Danube”. Nearly 15 years later, in 2014, I finally paid a visit to Hungary.
The Danube river is like a belt twining in the mid Europe. Budapest, straddles the banks of the Danube River, and the buildings in the city are pearls on the Danube belt. I arrived at Budapest at the end of April, as an unprecedented heat wave washed over Europe — from Berlin ,Warsaw, Krakow, Prague, to Budapest, the heat wave was chasing me, along with sudden showers that often arrived late afternoon. When it was not raining, the earth was shrouded in heat radiation.
Budapest used to be two cities — Buda, and Pest. Buda was the capital city, and is presently the capitol. Across the river, Pest is 2 times bigger, where most of the city residents live.
The front foot of Pest was already in modernity, everywhere is Costa Coffee,European version of Starbucks, and every car has a European Union’s license plate, indicating the reform and transition of Hungary; and the back foot was still halted in the old time, as trolleys in 1950s styles were still running, and the marble exterior of most buildings were with had turned into yellow over the years. Pest barely had urban forestry. Exposure to excessive sunlight in late April had melted my skin, as if was some sort of ice cream. Perhaps a while back ago, Pest did have sufficient street trees, but those trees withered. There were always a few corners of the street, full of overgrown glasses, existing there alone without the accompany of street tress.
I did some of my schoolwork (I was an exchange student in a university at Germany) on the first night at a Costa. The coffee shop was quite empty, I was facing a window covered by raindrops that look like crystal sticking on the glass window, reflecting the night light on the street. Only one waitress was serving behind the bar, and she was as young as me. I biked along the river bank crossed the bridge between Buda and pest, again and again. Even Pest was where most of the city population resided, its streets were quite empty, besides a bunch of tourists sitting on the outdoor seating of the cafés around the street corners.
Then the late afternoon rain started dropping. I hided in a Costa Coffee until the rain died down. I paddled the bike over the stone road shining like mirror after the shower. When I got back to the hostel we stayed, I ordered some dishes from the Turkish restaurant across the street — Budapest used to be the biggest Jewish populated city. Millions of Jews were transported to Auschwitz from this city. It’s also the biggest resided city of Romanic people, now, it also a population of Turkish immigrants.
I fled to a Costa coffee until The last night at Budapest, before our departure back to Germany, we met our temporary roommate in the hostel, a Korean lady, around 40 years old- she was single, just quitted her job, flied from South Korea to the European continent, travel alone around Europe. She slept on the upper level of the bunk bed, above me.

Let me tell you something upfront — Budapest isn’t the kind of city that screams for your attention like Paris or New York. It doesn’t shove its famous landmarks in your face. Instead, Budapest whispers. It draws you in quietly, one crumbling facade, one steaming chimney, one café window at a time. You don’t just “visit” Budapest — you drift through it.
I’ve walked these streets on misty winter mornings when the Danube looks like a silver ribbon cutting through the grey, and I’ve wandered them under the lazy orange glow of summer evenings when locals sit outside sipping fröccs and laughing like they’ve got all the time in the world. Budapest’s charm lives not only in its grand buildings but in the cracks between them.
This post isn’t about the tourist checklist. You already know the Parliament building looks like a gothic wedding cake and that the Chain Bridge is Instagram-worthy from every angle. I want to talk about the streets, the people, the smells, the awkward little corners where life in Budapest feels raw, imperfect, and utterly human.
You know you’re in the real Budapest when the sidewalks get uneven. The main boulevards — Andrássy Avenue, for example — are polished and postcard-perfect. But duck into the side streets, and suddenly the city exhales. Laundry flaps in courtyards, tiny grocery stores glow under flickering neon, old women with floral scarves shuffle along clutching plastic bags, and young students sit on crumbling stoops scrolling on their phones.
There’s graffiti here — some of it art, some of it just bored teenagers marking territory. But the layers of history are impossible to miss. You’ll pass an art nouveau balcony hanging precariously over a 1970s shoe repair shop. Above, the cracked stucco peels like old paint, revealing the city’s stubborn spirit underneath.
Walk around District VIII — Józsefváros. It’s raw, rough around the edges, but it’s real. Here, hip cafés with Edison bulbs and oat milk lattes sit side-by-side with corner bars where old men drink Unicum and mutter about politics. If you want shiny, sanitized Europe — this isn’t it. But if you want life? Welcome to Budapest.
Budapest has a specific smell — part bakery, part car exhaust, part sweet paprika floating from someone’s kitchen window. And yes, sometimes a hint of cigarettes — Hungarians smoke like it’s still 1995. But that mixture? It feels like a real city. A city where people live, not just pose for photos.
Stop by a pékség (bakery) in the morning. The langos might already be sizzling in oil, but most locals are grabbing simple pastries — kifli (crescent rolls), túrós batyu (sweet cheese pockets), maybe a slice of pogácsa (savory scone) if they skipped breakfast. Coffee? Strong. Cheap. No nonsense. Just the way it should be.
Here’s what I love — Budapest locals don’t care that you’re a tourist. They’re not rude, they’re not overly friendly — they’re just… doing their thing. If you want to fit in, keep your voice down, your head up, and your eyes open. Don’t expect big grins and “How’s your day going?” — this isn’t Disneyland. But ask for directions? Most people will help. Stumble through a few words in Hungarian? Their eyes soften immediately.
My favorite? Watching older folks play chess in the parks, completely oblivious to the TikTok kids filming dance videos nearby. It’s two worlds colliding — but that’s Budapest.
Skip the overpriced tourist menus on Váci Street. Head to the side streets for hearty, grandmother-approved meals. Goulash soup in a steaming ceramic bowl. Crispy duck legs with red cabbage. Cheap, buttery nokedli dumplings. It’s heavy. It’s filling. It’s perfect for cold evenings when your breath fogs the air.
And the bakeries? Let me say it again — never underestimate a Hungarian pastry.
Okay, let’s get real for a second. Budapest might feel like another world, but getting here isn’t rocket science.
Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport (BUD) welcomes budget airlines and major carriers alike. From most European cities, flights hover around €30–€100 if you book smart. From the US? Expect around $500–$800 round-trip, depending on the season.
Skip the overpriced taxis at arrivals. The 100E Airport Bus runs straight to the city center for about €5. Runs every 20 minutes. Easy.
It wasn’t the fancy cafés or grand architecture. It was this random Tuesday morning in early spring. Light drizzle. Streets still wet from rain. I ducked into a tiny coffee shop off Kálvin tér. The window fogged up as I sipped bitter coffee and listened to Hungarian indie rock playing softly. Outside, people hurried past with umbrellas, the city carrying on, oblivious to my little moment of stillness.
That? That’s why I travel. Not for the bucket list. For the seconds in between.
Budapest is rough around the edges, sometimes crumbling, often unpredictable — but never fake. It doesn’t try to impress you with perfection. It lets you discover its flaws, its beauty, its rhythm — and decide for yourself.
You might not “fall in love” instantly. But give it time. Walk the streets. Breathe in the mix of pastry, paprika, and city life. Listen to the language you don’t understand but somehow feels familiar.
And when you leave? You’ll miss it — I promise.

I know this is a blog about photography, but it’s also a blog about the way that we create and interpret imagery. I find Wes Anderson’s films a perfect focal point for this discussion about image, storytelling, and framing. Both because of what people seem to inherently understand about Anderson’s unique aesthetic, and also because of what people regularly misrepresent or ignore.
I’m not going to introduce Wes Anderson because if you’re reading this, you know his films. We all have our favourites- often the films which got us started with his 50s toned, highly symmetrical movies (mine is Rushmore). Today I’ll be talking about 2014’s The Grand Budapest Hotel and later about 2021’s The French Dispatch, because these films present (to me) a progression of Anderson’s use of the cinematic frame as a storytelling device.
Note on history of format and aspect ratio
35mm motion picture film- that is, the film itself- wasn’t a particularly revelatory technology. Industrial processing for 70mm photographic roll film was already established, and filmmaker WK Dickson found that by splitting the roll in half you got two 35mm rolls which were ample enough to capture the image rendered by lenses of the time.
Like many stories in early film history, Thomas Edison stuck his head in, forcing Dickson to spend the next five years attempting in vain to establish a new standard. But in the end and to this day, the economics of 35mm film have kept it as the standard, first capitalising on 70mm film industrialization, and later on its own mass production before any other format had the chance to get off the ground.
Traditional spherical lenses project a circular image. We cut the sides off for convenience and to avoid the outside edges of the image circle, which tend to be blurry. The most judicious use of the image circle (beyond simply leaving it circular) is to square it, which remains the standard in some large format photography. This square is, however, at odds with human perception. Every person experiences vision differently, but with two round eyes spaced apart, we can fairly assume that most people see the world significantly wider than square, and the history of aspect ratio is the economics and technology of rendering a cinematic image that better resembles our own eyes.
Early widescreen was limited by lens and film fidelity. You can only cut so far into your image before degrading the quality, widescreen had some success in using larger format 70mm film, but the most common ratios sat around 4:3. A slightly wider square, which was codified as the Academy Ratio after sound was added to movies.
The 4:3 academy frame was wider than square, without significantly reducing the amount of film (and ergo fidelity) used by each frame. Throughout the 1930s and 40s the Great Depression cut into discretionary spending, 70mm film was considered too expensive to use, and further widescreen advances lay dormant.
By the 1950s, the mainstream adoption of television forced filmmakers to innovate. Widescreen implementations which were as simple as changing the matte in a projector were only possible by letterboxing already small tv screens.
In 1952, 20th Century Fox bought rights to a military technology which allowed for wide angle viewing from inside tanks via oval lenses, and coming out with The Robe a year later– the first film shot in ‘scope’ format. Anamorphic lenses squeeze the image on the way into the film plane, allowing twice as much width to fit into a piece of film. The image is in turn desqueezed by the projector, turning a 4:3 frame of 35mm film into a 1:2.9 image. In 1954 Vistavision was established as a more economical way to widen screens, flipping 35mm negative sideways to give an aspect of 1:1.5 which could be further cropped to 1:2 and the modern television standard 1:1.85 (16:9).
Aspect Ratio in The Grand Budapest Hotel
The Grand Budapest Hotel is a nesting doll of narratives. We open to the shrine of a dead author, a visitor holds a book (The Grand Budapest Hotel), and turns to the author’s picture on the back cover. We match cut to the author in an office in 1985, the author tells us about the way stories fall into your lap once the world knows your an author. The aspect ratio changes to 1:1.85 (16:9).
The film is going to pull this menouvre on us often, and it’s keen to make us aware that multiple threads of storytelling are going to take place. It also wants us to know that these stories are being buffed a little with a polish of nostalgic recollection. When our author calls the hotel, “a picturesque, elaborate and once widely celebrated establishment” we cut again to 4:3, and a bright pink hotel reveals itself against an obvious matte painting and a foreground of dimensionless buildings. This part of the story, the filmmaking insists, is literally flattened by layers of recollection as the author character declares, “The incidents that follow were described to me exactly as I present them here, and in a wholly unexpected way.”
Through the remainder of Grand Budapest the moving frame lines serve to remind us not only that there are multiple timelines, but that each timeline is filtered through its own series of storytellers. Wes Anderson’s visuals get flack for being so easily identifiable, but they have an in-text justification in Grand Budapest, where the further removed our author gets from the action, the more the world takes on qualities of the fanciful and make-believe.
Throughout the film, danger is framed by windows- the Zubrowkan army enter the film via a train window, they are spied through a window in the hotel, and Dmitri’s henchman Joplin pursues Deputy Kovacs, first visible through a bus window: Danger abounds, but the existential threat of war seems almost out of scope with the limitations of the story. In the scene of Gustave’s death the frame is robbed of its intense colour, too raw still for Zero the storyteller (Agatha’s death is given no screen time, only narration over imagery of their wedding.)
Why?
So the movie is a nesting doll of different narratives which get progressively distorted through storytelling. It’s a study in the stories we tell, the people and places, we remember, and how we remember them. But also. Why?
Why 4:3 (1.375:1 for pedants), 1.85:1, and 2.35:1? Each time period in the film lines up with the mainstream adoption of that aspect ratio, and so the changing aspect ratios can be considered another part of the set design, which changes dramatically from timeline to timeline. As the browning halls of the 1968 Hotel are rendered in brilliant pinks and reds when we flash back to 1932, so too does the ceiling of the cinematic frame literally grow taller. The perspective literally grows wider and- perhaps- more nuanced- with the historical perspective. Does the film suggest that we’re so far removed from the 30s that what we can perceive is literally cut off on the sides? It’s for you to decide.
It may seem quite contrived to suggest that the narrowing aspect ratio represents a neglecting of the edges of our historical perception, but evidence for this can be found in the text. Our dual protagonists, Zero and Gustave, are a refugee and a bisexual, respectively. Theirs are stories which have been sidelined throughout history, and positioning them in this historical context- even in what remains a comedic romp for most of its runtime. Asks us as audience to consider what stories and characters like Zero and Gustave have been sidelined.
Wes Anderson’s movies draw attention to their own filmmaking to the point of easy categorisation and parody. But too often I believe people categorise as an easy out from analysis.
The estrangement effect has roots in Chinese theatre and Russian Formalism, but was codified into Western theatre by Bertolt Brecht. Brecht’s aim for the estrangement effect (verfremdungseffekt) was that breaking the illusion, and reminding the audience that they were viewing a piece of fiction would force them to engage with the underlying politics. Wikipedia’s description is quite elegant:
“By disclosing and making obvious the manipulative contrivances and “fictive” qualities of the medium, the actors attempt to alienate the viewer from any passive acceptance and enjoyment of the play as mere “entertainment”. Instead, the goal is to force viewers into a critical, analytical frame of mind that serves to disabuse them of the notion that what they are watching is necessarily an inviolable, self-contained narrative. This effect of making the familiar strange serves a didactic function insofar as it aims to teach the viewer not to take the style and content for granted, since (proponents argue) the theatrical medium itself is highly constructed and contingent upon many cultural and economic conditions.”
“Disclosing and making obvious the manipulative contrivances” may not be Wes Anderson’s obvious aim, but the fact that his films are so readily categorised and broken down may at least hint that the estrangement effect is in place. And what are the politics of The Grand Budapest Hotel? It concerns two fringe identities in the face of encroaching fascism.
It is in this way that Grand Budapest is tidily packaged in that thematic dichotomy can be found in the visual aesthetic, and the two feed back into one and other: The rose-tint of nostalgia against the cultural trauma of fascism.
It can seem counter-intuitive, when one of the major criticisms levied against Anderson’s films is that they hide lack of substance behind beautiful aesthetics. But if we consider that the opposite may be true, can the lush aesthetics of The Grand Budapest Hotel, especially during the aesthetic rug-pull of the tawdry 1968 hotel, be hiding its politics precisely within its visuals? The set designs of Grand Budapest Hotel took inspiration from ski resorts rendered in photochrom, a method of colouring black and white photography by hand. They appear stunning in their subtle pastel palettes. But at the same time, the colours they claim to represent are entirely fabricated- left to the artistic choices of the colourist. The hyperreality throughout The Grand Budapest Hotel reminds us that all is not what it seems, and the centering of characters who would have been sidelined by fascism and other historical oppressions serves to challenge our romanticised notions of pre-war Europe.
Which brings us back to the box. The shape of the box in which the Grand Budapest Hotel plays out literally changes shape throughout the movie. Within, it helps guide us through jumps between time periods, but outside of the box, the changing shape serves to remind us that it is the box that we are watching. That this is a fictionalised, romanticised and nostalgic rendition of a far different reality. I think, if you’ve been willing to follow me this far, the characteristic Wes Anderson visuals and irreverent humour do credit to this film. They make the film appear beautiful and whimsical, but in doing so, challenge the viewer to contemplate what parts of a story remain too painful to tell, what has recollection- and history in turn- brushed outside of the frame?

Hi there! Maeghan & Oli here - we're taking a break to travel the world and hope you'll join us for the ride. 🌏✈️ 👫 www.alittledetour.ca

We’re not going to lie, Maeghan was a little upset to learn that the Grand Budapest Hotel didn’t exist in real life…. but with everything that we heard about Budapest, she felt optimistic with the our next destination.
Budapest was fantastic. We walked around most days exploring the city and eating great food. There were so many different craft beer bars and bottles shops, this is the first time we didn’t have a chance to hit them all! Budapest was also super popular with stag parties and student travellers — I guess it is just that time of year.
We also hit a snag when we had our first encounter with bed bugs in our Airbnb downtown. But our skills as backpackers has reached a new level of awesome and we had identified the problem, found a new place, packed our bags and were out of there in under 15 minutes.
Other than that, we loved it here so much, we decided to extend our stay not once, but twice 😊
See more on our website www.alittledetour.ca🌏✈️👫
On our second day in Budapest. Maeghan was sitting on the couch journaling and Oli was on his computer researching. We decided to switch places so we could recharge our devices and Olivier went on a hunt to find another power outlet. He looked behind the couch and noticed a tiny little bug on the wall in the living room…. it looked kind of like a bed bug…
So he grabbed a spoon, put the little guy in a glass and started a fine eye search to see if there was more. Well… there was.
Olivier found a dozen or so dead bed bug bodies (or a high confidence they were after looking at Google) and put them on a paper towel. Maeghan called the Airbnb host to ask him about this.. since Olivier kept finding more and more bodies and the skins of the bugs inbetween all the crevases of the couch.
Our host said they had bed bugs a few weeks ago, but had the exterminator come twice.. and not to worry unless we found a living one… and we did..
So within 15 minutes… we had their bags packed, space cleaned and they were ready to peace — with success. No bed bugs were carried and they found a new nicer Airbnb all in the nick of time!
The 2nd largest thermal pools in the world next to Iceland. We hope to visit both!
We saw this and thought of all our PasswordBox friends❤️. Ping Pong was an intense sport in the office, we had two and there would always be tournaments.. or two co-workers battling it out. But this seems like a new level of ping pong!
Ruin bar. Made in the ruins of an old building and furnished with only 2nd hand things. Also, has 18 bars in the one location — so you can go to the wine bar, gin bar, craft beer bar… etc. The best place for any group party!

This article is a postscript to a previous article I wrote about how Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel uses a timeline of cinematic technology and formatting to differentiate nesting framing devices. Hinted at but slightly outside of the scope of that article was Anderson’s use of theatrical techniques. Specifically- in echoing Brecht’s Epic Theatre. The Grand Budapest Hotel deals directly with fascism, so it seems worthwhile to compare the Marxist and antifascist underpinnings of Brecht’s technique, with the ways Wes Anderson succeeds (and fails) to employ them.
One of the primary goals for the establishment of the Frankfurt School was to interrogate why the German Revolution of 1918 ended the way it did. How did the birthplace of Karl Marx find itself at the end of a political upheaval turning to the allures of capitalism, and ultimately, fascism?
Bertolt Brecht’s Epic Theatre is one of a number of artistic forms which attempted to side-step the motivations of capitalism and to speak directly to his audience. I am no Brecht scholar, and a lot of nuance will be glossed over in this article, however put as simply as possible Epic Theatre employed a range of techniques aimed to snap their audience back into reality. And where were they really? They were in a theatre, watching a play.
Brecht thought that by refusing to let his audience suspend their disbelief, he could force them to engage with the ideas and values of his play, rather than getting lost in investment in the character’s emotional journeys. Brecht was a Marxist, and the ideas and values his plays contained were often specifically anti-capitalist ones. Some thinkers of the Frankfurt School further theorised on these techniques, which we’ll talk about later in this article.
“I find Bertolt Brecht’s epic form, only out of focus, muddied by the bourgeois values of the neoliberal era.” says G.D. Brown of Wes Anderson’s most recent film The French Dispatch in a fairly incendiary Popmatters Article.
No matter Wes’ personal politics, his work is forged in neoliberalism. No matter how artistically successful any viewer may find his works, it is the box office that decides whether Wes Anderson keeps making movies. Furthermore, if he does aspire to the same revolutionary art which forged the Brechtian aesthetic, it is not apparent from his subject matter, nor his frequent brand collaborations.
“It is hardly a wonder that Anderson has directed commercials for SoftBank and American Express, for the likes of Stella Artois, Prada, H&M, AT&T, Hyundai, and Sony. His highly-stylized advertisements have connected common products and the arms of finance to sophisticated notions of film as elevated art, to visual reassurances of certain standards of taste and cultured cool. Of course, Anderson is not the first director of artistic merit to commercialize his talents. Supper won’t pay for itself.” G.D. Brown, Life After Brecht: Wes Anderson’s Lowbrow Dialectics
For Brown, the neoliberalism of Anderson’s aesthetic is rotten to its core: Its themes of minority identity under fascism function as appeals to the comfort of modernity rather than provocative calls to action. Indeed, the communists in Grand Budapest are just as hostile and threatening to the film's protagonists as the fascists (whether the communists depicted in Grand Budapest represent anything like actual communism is outside of the scope of this article.)
“In Brecht’s plays, his cues leading audiences away from the naturalist immersion of storytelling and toward the theater as an unreal portrayal (his breaking the fourth wall, his narrators and movements into song, and so on) were meant to prod the viewer into meaningful engagement with their own historical circumstances…
Anderson has faced criticism for his portrayal of largely white, upper-class characters in contrast with the roles of workers and people of color. As the viewer becomes aware of Anderson’s on-screen values, they must, like Brecht, take on the dialectical mindset to best understand the infusion of revolutionary form and bourgeois content, placing Anderson in the context of the neoliberal turn of the last half of the 20th Century.”
— G.D. Brown, Life After Brecht: Wes Anderson’s Lowbrow Dialectics
The accusation- for those who find this style exhausting (and I’m aware my writing often falls into this style)- is that Wes Anderson uses the stylings of revolutionary art, which is real and important. However, he uses them as a hollow appropriation. Anderson (though not necessarily through conscious intention) is packaging up the Brecht’s technique the same way he packages up other high-brow aesthetics (fine art, high fashion), resulting in an easily digestible remedy for intellectual and class anxiety.
An excellent quote from Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello’s The New Spirit of Capitalism, (which I pilfered from an also great Broey Deschanel video) spells out the process by which contemporary capitalism consumes and repackages revolutionary ideas, saying:
“To maintain its powers of attraction, capitalism therefore has to draw upon resources external to it, beliefs which, at a given moment in time, possess considerable powers of persuasion, striking ideologies, even when they are considered hostile to it.”
— Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello, The New Spirit of Capitalism
Conversely, it could be argued that this form of neoliberal media is the necessary conduit to deliver revolutionary ideas to a mainstream audience. In The Andersonian Theatricality by Irene Kalesi, Anderson’s use of humour is explored as a cloak through which to smuggle critique and revolutionary ideas. Having made the link to Brechtian technique, Kalesi writes:
Comedy when used accurately can be the harshest judge of situations and the greatest fighter for change. Jones points out that “comedy is a vehicle for subtly (or not so subtly) addressing these injustices by mocking the social norms in the hope of slowly changing the masses’ beliefs about the inequalities”. Therefore, the employment of comedy can be pointed towards parodying and thus criticizing war and the collapse of the social ideals. The comedic atmosphere helps the audience engage with the film’s sensitive topic, namely a story that takes place during a tumultuous historical period. This bittersweet story needs the comedic perspective in order to avoid being an overly emotional burden on the viewer. The power of theatre is that it helps the audience not to identify with a character per se but it makes them contemplate deeply about the events happening on stage. According to Aristophanes, serious matters should be touched by the genre of comedy. As Dicaepolis from “Acharnians” says: “Comedy too can sometimes discern what is right. I shall not please but I shall say what is true”. Therefore, the power of comedy is to reveal truths and centralize issues that concern the spectators.
— Irene Kalesi, The Andersonian Theatricality
In Marxist theory, praxis is the putting of theory into action: it can be used to emphasise the importance of engagement and activity toward a common goal, without dismissing the importance of theory.
So does Wes Anderson’s work, specifically The Grand Budapest Hotel, hold up to the criticisms of the Frankfurt School aestheticians who created the groundwork for understanding Brecht’s epic theatre? I’m not uniquely qualified to tell you. But we can try to chase the logic down together: Writing specifically about Brecht, Walter Benjamin wrote:
“The task of epic theatre, Brecht believes, is not so much to develop actions as to represent conditions. But ‘represent’ does not here signify ‘reproduce’ in the sense used by the theoreticians of Naturalism. Rather, the first point at issue is to uncover those conditions. (One could just as well say: to make them strange.) This uncovering (making strange, alienating) of conditions is brought about by processes being interrupted.”
— Walter Benjamin, Understanding Brecht
And furthermore:
“Epic theatre casts doubt upon the notion that theatre is entertainment. It shakes the social validity of theatre-as-entertainment by robbing it of its function within the capitalist system. It also threatens the privileges of the critics. These privileges are based on the technical expertise which enables the critic to make certain observations about productions and performances. The criteria he applies in making his observations are only very rarely within his own control; he seldom worries about this, but relies upon ‘theatre aesthetics’ in the details of which nobody is particularly interested. If, however, the aesthetic of the theatre ceases to remain in the background, if its forum is the audience and its criterion is no longer the effect registered by the nervous system of single individuals but the degree to which the mass of spectators becomes a coherent whole, then the critic as he is constituted today is no longer ahead of that mass but actually finds himself far behind it.”
— Walter Benjamin, Understanding Brecht
This leaves us at somewhat of a junction in considering Anderson. Is the Andersonian Aesthetic a reproduction of these ‘theatre aesthetics’, or does the use of theatrical technique and aesthetic in a cinematic context alienate the viewer from more conservative cinematic techniques? I think your opinions about neoliberalism may define where you sit.
If all revolutionary aesthetics are consumed and repackaged under capitalism, is praxis in media possible? Herbert Marcuse, another thinker of the Frankfurt School, was slightly more optimistic.
“It seems that art as art expresses a truth, an experience, a necessity which, although not in the domain of radical praxis, are nevertheless essential components of revolution”
— Herbert Marcuse, The Aesthetic Dimension
Marcuse took it one step further than Benjamin in that he believed it was the authentic artistic experience that anyone could encounter the thirst for revolution and come to sympathise with the failings of capitalism. Whether Wes Anderson’s art hits even this bar for authenticity is again up to personal judgment.
That capitalism will, in time, homogenise all cinematic aesthetics into a sort of grey sludge seems inevitable. You can see it happen in real time. But hangers-on like Wes Anderson, who thrive in a space that is alternative if only by degrees- these artists may well be the first glimpse of real art many filmgoers experience. Can intellectually honest ideas be mined from these works? This writer believes that even if they can’t, you ought to look.

Dear Margaret,
I traveled home to Hungary several times since I moved to France, the last time we met. I always just ran through the city to catch my connection to my home town and never stopped by to embrace the beauty of it again. Since you moved abroad too, there was nothing to keep me here for longer.
This time, it was different. My boyfriend came with me and I started to look at the streets we used to walk distinctly — like I’ve never seen them before, like an actual tourist.
At first glance, it seemed like everything remained the same — your favorite art nouveau buildings, the century old parks, historical squares… If only those walls could talk!
Yet, everything seemed changed. It’s been only 4 years since we said our goodbye here but it feels like decades have passed.
I took my boyfriend to the Danube river, or as we call it in Hungarian: Duna, for a stroll taking advantage of the last warm days of summer. I never noticed before how green our capital is, did you Margaret? I don’t recall if we ever talked about it.

When I was younger, single with not many cares in this world, I traveled quite a bit. I still do but it’s different now.
I was fortunate to work for a company based near Bristol, England. Once or twice a year I would travel to our corporate offices for meetings and/or training. Lucky me!
I would almost always take advantage of being overseas and book my vacations from there. Inexpensive flights to European cities made it a no-brainer.
One of the trips I took was to Budapest. I was quite spoiled as I acquired hotel points that allowed me to stay in hotels I would not have otherwise been able to afford.
Like the Marriott right on the Vltava River overlooking the Chain Bridge and Castle Hill. This was the view from my room.
I spent five or so days wandering around. For three of those days, a co-worker friend flew over and met me. It was nice to have someone to hang out with for a few days.

The more we observe a city, the more apparent it becomes that it surpasses the sum of its parts. It resembles a colossal, intricate organism with its network of organs and unique internal dynamics. These dynamics are a tapestry woven from our daily interactions within the city: the bustling morning and evening rush on the tram or subway lines and leisurely strolls along the riverbank — it all contributes to this vibrant tapestry.
Though it sounds idyllic, it stands worlds apart from the vast data streams of corporations, the omnipresent data visualization tools, the ongoing buzz about artificial intelligence across various platforms, or even the fundamental essence of artistic expression — music.
“Melody of Budapest,” sponsored by Telekom Hungary, aims to bridge these divides by transforming the city’s dynamic mobility patterns into a musical piece using data science and AI. Initially, Janosov and the data team of Telekom Hungary processed large-scale cell tower-based mobility data at a resolution of 100m into digestible information. This unpublished data covers the temporal and spatial specifics of every mobile phone event on Telekom’s network in Budapest, Hungary, from June 2022 to 2023, linked to their…

Recently, I was on a river cruise through the Lower Danube on AmaWaterways with Christian (TellMeWhyTravel). The stops along the way included Budapest, Hungary, Bratislava, Slovakia, Durnstein, Salzburg, and Vienna, Austria. All of the cities are known for its historical importance from war, due to their strategic location on the river, to arts and culture, where some of the greatest minds which ever existed created. However, by the time you’ve gotten to this page, you already know about Mozart, the Hungarian Parliament, Buda Castle, and the other tourist attractions your tour guide will show you. As our tour guide YOLO (Yes! That’s his name!) said, “Do you see ABC? ABC, another bloody church, additional broken castle.” While I can respect the art and architecture, and the blood, sweat, and tears that went into the churches, castles, and monuments of the era, once I’ve seen one (or two) I’ve kind of seen them all. (There are definitely some cool churches and castles but that’s for a different story!)
I’m going to take you off the beaten path and show you some of the art and culture of today in these cities. Today’s obscure artists will be the Mozart’s, Picasso’s, and Spielberg’s of tomorrow. The Internet has brought most of the things to our homes but art is something we must experience in person!
If you’re staying at the Aria next to the Church of St. Stephen, you’re in a good place to start.
Most of the museums are within walking distance between 1–3 miles and you’ll get to see the other landmarks of Budapest along the way!
So let’s get started!
Want to check out some contemporary art museums further up?
Both of these museums looked pretty cool, unfortunately the Q was temporarily closed for installation.
If you’re already tired or didn’t see anything interesting you can check out the Széchenyi Thermal Bath, which features 18 pools and saunas but also has an exciting retro architecture, which reminded me of high school.
But maybe you’re not done yet. Walk down past the ruin bars to the Palace District.
Have a drink or two here, usually you’ll find some live music, poetry reading, or lively conversation!
From here there are a few advanced options:
About 25 minutes away is the Ludwig Museum, related to the Mumok in Vienna. It’s worth seeing some of the collection which includes Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, and Joseph Beuys.
Cross the bridge and at the base of Gellért-hegy Jubileumi park is Faur Zsófi Gallery. We hiked to the top of it, but the park is still undergoing renovations but a stunning view nonetheless.
Also closeby is the music venue A38, where we were lucky enough to see the band Henge.
Not tired yet? Cross the chain bridge and get to the Buda side of the city.
In the oldest part of the city, Obuda, stands a shrine to one of the city’s most famous contemporary artists, Victor Vasarely, the father of the optical art movement.
Then cross back over to Pest and hit Kalman Maklary Fine Arts an interesting contemporary gallery (no exhibitions this year yet) which is close to parliament and a short stroll from the Aria.
If you happen to come in mid October, check out Art Market Budapest which is also near the first round of galleries near the opera house and the Aria.
Now if you didn’t finish all of that in your two day pre-cruise, don’t worry, you’ll have a chance to come back at the end of the cruise!
Sailing
The Slovak National Gallery is close to where the ship docks.
Three options for the outskirts of the city; I don’t think you can walk here, you might need to take a taxi, bike, or public transportation.
Rudavskys Magic Garden: The garden is closed for the winter, but looks incredible when it’s warmer!
The Július Koller Society
Tranzit
Danubiana Meulensteen Art Museum: This looks like a very cool museum atop a peninsula jutting into the Danube. I didn’t see it from the ship, but along with its sculpture park, it seems like an awesome place to check out the latest contemporary art!
Sailing
The next stop is in the Wachau Valley, specifically Durnstein. While Durnstein is a quiet town with not much contemporary art, 8km from Durnstein is a small cosmopolitan town, Krems an der Donau, with some interesting art options.
The map is zoomed out to show the proximity to Durnstein where the ship is docked.
Sailing
The following day we docked and took about a 90 minute bus ride to the quaint city of Salzburg, known for being the birthplace of Mozart. It’s also known for being the backdrop to the 1960’s classic The Sound of Music.
The city is surrounded by a steep rock face which made it an impenetrable during times of war. However, the top of mountain is a contemporary art museum. You get natural and manmade art from the top of the elevator ride!
But before we get there, global gallery Thaddaeus Ropac has two locations in Salzburg! Check to see if there are exhibitions at the farther one near the train station before you trek up there.
Finally, Galerie HAAS & GSCHWANDTNER is moving from its downtown location to somewhere else within Salzburg. Check their website to see where they end up!
Sailing
We made it! Vienna, Austria the largest, most cosmopolitan city on the Danube. The art scene here is huge with tons of galleries, museums, and history.
We will try to avoid the two most famous artists from Austria, Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt, because the Neue Gallery on 86th and 5th in New York houses Ronald Lauder’s huge collection of Austrian art including Klimt’s Lady in Gold.
The bus to old city will drop you about 5 minutes northeast of St. Stephen’s Cathedral.
There are a lot of galleries in the first district, here’s the east side of the city first.
The west side is next, the order is assuming that you are coming from the bus drop off location
On the east side of the outer museum loop
There are a few major art fairs that take place in Vienna:
March: Spark Art Fair
May: Affordable Art Fair
September: Vienna Contemporary and Curated By
November: Vienna Art Week
Austrian artists that I didn’t get a chance to see:
Stefan Eins: He stopped by my Times Square exhibition multiple times and had some crazy stories about when he started Fashion Moda in the South Bronx in the 80s.
Andre Heller: Multi-hyphenate who commissioned Luna Luna
Helmut Lang: the famed photographer
Franz West: Sculptor and artist
On the outskirts of the city is the Essl Museum, which houses what is considered the most important collection of Austrian art after 1945.
From here the ship sails back to the beginning port, Budapest.
Did we miss something? Drop a comment and we’ll be sure to check it out next time and let you know how it was.
Interested in recreating this experience? (You’ll now have the maps to save time instead of us stumbling around)
Here’s the link to the AmaWaterways cruise and the Aria hotel, which is voted the best in Central Europe consistently!
NB: There was an issue with Google Maps acting weird so instead of wasting time figuring it out, I made different maps for each art “district” in Budapest and Vienna.

Budapest is one of my favourite cities. Had an absolutely delightful day here. I would even chuck in a few of my other blog buzz words including “beautiful”, “lovely” and “ absolutely amazing”.
What better way to start the day. I had booked a tour which could have up to 8 guests and showed up at Central Market Hall. It was $145 which was a massive stretch but honestly why not. This is an incredible building inspired by the Eiffel Tower. The Hungarian government built four of these across the city in the 1870’s after all the open air markets got infested with cockroaches and snow for most of the year.
To my incredible fortune, the mysterious Mr & Mrs Chapelle from the US were both unwell and unable to attend. Private tour baby! With portions made for 4! I steeled myself for feeling like a spoiled baby.
I now also felt no concern in asking Orsha to photograph me as her happy customer.
Over the four hours and 12 spots I was reminded just why I love food tours. The history of a people is in their food. It explains their culture, customs and sends you directly into every family’s dinner table. Hungarian food also happens to perfectly correlate with my food preferences. We are talking:
I will now give you the rundown in several loose listicle paragraphs.
Market foods were first up.
This is their street food. A donut covered in garlic juice, sour cream and a mild cheddar. How could this not be delicious.
Next up we had the salami. I tried types called horse, curly haired pig, pork cheese (has all the different bits of the animal as different cubes) and Hungarian winter. Horse weirdly tasted how I thought it would. A wild earthy flavour that made me think of riding horses.
Some of the interesting things we saw in the market include a tonne of foie gras- Hungary is one the worlds largest producers- a tonne of fat and a delicacy of a whole chicken with an egg still in it.
A benefit of being on this tour alone was that Orsha had to field all my questions. She was likely unprepared for the grilling that arrived. Some facts for you:
The pickle tasting. That is right. The Hungarians are super into pickles. I was led down several alleys to the pickle basement. Cordoned off due to its offensive fragrance. She was concerned I might not like the smell. As an amateur pickler and somebody that has hosted an actual pickle party she couldn’t have worried more pointlessly.
Enter Marika, my hero. Handmaking pickles in the basement for over 50 years.
I got to choose my very own pickle selection and try them out. Easily the best I have ever had. My favourites were the kraut and the mini watermelons.
When I get back I am going to flat out not stop until I have prepared a pickle jar with a smile on it. Look forward to Christmas presents everybody as I think a month of unemployment should just about do it.
Also coincidentally I screenshotted this yesterday. I will just leave it here.
You know what else the Hungarians are into? Deliciousness. Lunch was this sausage and goulash place. Served with oodles of cabbage and horseradish. Divine. Followed by some iced coffee and cake that I ate before taking a picture of. It started with one forkful, then quickly snowballed until both slices were gobbled up.
I learnt a bit more historical stuff from Orsha too. Something I noticed as soon as I got off the train was how decrepit all the old buildings were. I asked Orsha what was up with that.
Basically what happened was that the Hungarians sided with Germany in both world wars. Hence they had massive damage in WW2 from gunfire and allied bombing.
After WW2 Hungary lost heaps of its land and was handed to the Soviets. After that they were largely communist. The soviets converted all the rich aristocratic houses into social housing and didn’t bother to repair them for 50 years. Hence the damage on these houses is genuinely from WW2.
There was also a large wall discovered from the original Budapest boundaries recently that we strolled past.
The strangest part of the whole thing was the final portion of the tour. Wine and cheese tasting with an actual sommelier in a huge cellar. I must say this was certainly not designed for one person, and certainly not a wine noob such as myself. I laughed and sipped and enjoyed desert wine with blue cheese as I nodded along to my very own personal wine lecture. A glorious combination.
My personal sommelier had not much to say to me after I requested to try some non alcoholic wines. I was having too much fun at this time and asked him all about what he thought about them. He said simply that it was a disgrace and “grape juice”. Oh Gregor. Keep pouring em.
I strolled home after this, quite drunk and somehow lost an earring. A perfect day really. Topped up off with such a heavy nap that I fell asleep on my sunglasses and hairbrush.
Loving it here. Really coming into its own this whole “Europe” thing. The further east we are getting the more I am loving it which is promising. The fast pace is also a nice change that is making time go very fast.
Today was just great. I very clearly need to do more food tours as it is just about my favourite experience a human can have. Tired but loved today.

I’m well aware that we don’t all rewatch films at the same time. We are all subject to individual whims that diverge and intersect largely at random. That said, I do think that in the near future many of us will be rewatching Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel.
This prediction is based on several factors: the impending release of Anderson’s new film The Phoenician Scheme, a renewed (or perhaps wholly original) fondness for Ralph Fiennes following his performance in Conclave, and the general critical consensus that The Grand Budapest Hotel represents the culmination of Anderson’s artistic vision. Essentially, if we’re due for a Wes Anderson rewatch, this will be the film a good 75–80% of participants will pick.
It’s my belief that when people do return to it, they’ll find the same thing I found during my recent rewatch. It’s better now than it was the first time. Why? Because time is a flat circle and our moral dilemmas have a habit of resurfacing in new disguises.
Viewers noted from the film’s release that one of its key themes was the rise of fascism. What I think we lacked in 2014 was an understanding of fascism as a recurring threat rather than one that was just as much an article of the past as the Grand Budapest itself. Sure, we could link the film’s commentary on the treatment of immigrants to ongoing crises in the world, but we didn’t see fascist militaries boarding trains and demanding visas. We saw… logistical challenges.
This political inattentiveness at the time of the film’s release contributed to a chronic misinterpretation of the two protagonists. Primarily, critics were prone to forgetting there were, in fact, two protagonists.
Readers may have noticed my use of the pronoun “we” up to this point when making my points. The “we” I am referring to are fellow white beneficiaries of the imperial core. To those reading who do not fit into that category, my apologies, but you’ll see the utility in a moment.
Our greatest failing when initially addressing The Grand Budapest Hotel at the time of its release, was to center our attentions almost entirely on M. Gustave for analysis. He is by all means a fascinating character with many aspects to pick apart and discuss; however, his function in the narrative is to serve as a catalyst and foil for our true central character, Zero.
The Grand Budapest Hotel is presented in layers, a trick Anderson has become quite fond of if his more recent film Asteroid City is any indication. The film opens on a young girl reading a book next to the grave of the book’s author, who awaits us in the next layer to detail a story from his youth, where in the next layer he meets with the aging proprietor of a hotel far past its prime situated in the fictional alpine nation of Zubrowka, and in the final layer where most of the film takes place, the proprietor recounts his time as a lobby boy at the hotel. By all accounts, the narrator and arbiter of style for most of the film is Zero (or at least the image of Zero his older self conveys to the author).
Like many of Anderson’s films, this one concerns itself with nostalgia for bygone eras. This nostalgia textures the memory of previous times to such a degree that they become more of a fantastical setting than a true reflection of the past, putting a pair of rose-tinted glasses on for the audience. Against the backdrop of a pastel 1930s Europe, we’re confronted with a group of characters who deliberately clash with it. While the staff of The Grand Budapest and the other members of the Society of Crossed Keys all stand out with vivid color, they are contrasted by the setting’s rising fascist movement dressed entirely in monochrome.
A common criticism I’ve found of Anderson’s work is that he prioritizes style over substance, that his chief concern is the aesthetic coherence of an auteur rather than the merit of his narratives. While in some cases this may be fair, what my rewatch of The Grand Budapest Hotel illustrated for me is that to measure style against substance is to create a false dichotomy. That is because, in this film style elucidates substance, substance that in 2014 we were perhaps less primed to recognize.
The rosiness of The Grand Budapest’s past and the whimsical absurdity of its inhabitants are the product of Zero’s recollection, because at this point in his life the hotel may as well be a fairyland compared to what came before. We learn later in the film, following a frustrated outburst from Gustave that gives way to a host of xenophobic insults, that Zero came to Zubrowka from an unnamed Arab country going through a state of political turmoil. He fled after witnessing the execution of his entire family and the lingering threat from the encroaching fascist army will mean death for him, should they choose to deport him.
While most reviews of the film at its release were positive, the few notable criticisms were leveled against the plot, some saying it felt nonsensical and unconnected to any broader theme. And when you view the film with Gustave as its true protagonist, the criticism makes sense. However, when you consider the film from Zero’s perspective, there’s an obvious logic as to why he would focus on patently silly events and madcap drama. To him, these are the good times. Times when he had his mentor and wife with him, when the fascists were a distant presence that only occasionally menaced him, and he had a home that filled him with a sense of purpose. This is the story he wishes to tell.
In the narrative layer where he speaks with the author, the now dilapidated Grand Budapest is the last vestige of that former life Zero still possesses. He explains that he maintains it not in memory of Gustave, who embodied the hotel’s spirit and ultimately bequeathed it to him, but in memory of his wife Agatha. This was the place they were happy together, however short that time may have been. The utility of memory is such that by sharing it we allow ourselves to be better understood.
We made the mistake of assuming fascism was included in the movie to emphasize that theme of memory, that is was a thing of the past that poked a hole in an otherwise happy period, but we also presumed that the only associations with it that mattered are our own. It is easier for us to relate to Gustave, because like him, our confrontations with fascist oppression are taken on by choice. Even with the added context that some of us, like Gustave, are queer and have that as a potential target on our backs, our existences are not constantly hounded by fascist dogma in the same way those of immigrants and refugees are.
While Zero’s growth over the course of the film is defined by him establishing himself as an integral part of the Grand Budapest’s community, Gustave’s arc centers his developing awareness of his own privilege and the value of his relationships with others. He comes to understand that there are ways to relate to others beyond providing a service.
The scene that I find most striking ten years later is a scene shot entirely in monochrome. It is an echo of an earlier scene and an escalation of the film’s color language. The fascist army boards the train and enters the train car occupied by Gustave, Zero, and Zero’s wife Agatha. They request the travelers’ papers, though this time with a heavier threat hanging over their heads should they produce the wrong kind of papers. Zero pulls out a wrinkled and ripped work visa, which Gustave confirms the legitimacy of and even produces a card from a commander in the fascist army indicating they should be allowed to pass. The fascist army members do not accept this. And Gustave, as the author is told by an older Zero, gave his life trying to ensure Zero’s safe passage. What precisely happened to Zero and Agatha in the two years between Gustave’s death and the death of Agatha and her child is left ambiguous, but one can presume they were not happy times.
It is easy for things to become commonplace which would have been unthinkable just a few years prior. We now live in a version of the US confident in its power to harass, detain, and deport immigrants on a whim. We have people boarding our trains and asking for our documents at this very moment. What The Grand Budapest Hotel wants us to realize is that we have a duty to the person sitting next to us. It can be easy to allow injustices to pass us by due to relative distance, to cling to a veneer of civility and not make a fuss.
Perhaps the most insidious misinterpretation of the film is that Gustave is a good man because of his civility, that his politeness brings him karmic rewards because he does not discriminate in who he is polite to. The aforementioned scene refutes this assertion, bookmarked in black and white so the audience takes care to remember. Gustave was a good man because he knew when to take action, and he gained that knowledge through his friendship with Zero. If his strength is his civility, then true civility must include a refusal to sit by and allow harm to come to the people around you.
The Grand Budapest Hotel is a better film now in 2025 than it was at release, because present political circumstances make it far more difficult for us to miss the point. Zero was always the heart of the story, his attachment to the hotel always in relation to how it provided a home for him rather than a vocation. It is only now that we begin to develop the consciousness to understand these things outside of our own privileged experience. It is no longer possible to ignore.
We feel the weight of the world of memory Anderson presents more keenly now because we have lost the benefit of distance from the time it represents.

There is a certain pattern I notice in cities all over Europe that is both unique and also interesting. If there is a huge shopping mall either as part of the complex or in the immediate vicinity of the main railway station of an urban area, that particular city has a lot to offer to its visitors. In the case of Poznań, it is no different either.
On the surface, the city on the River Warta is one of Poland’s largest urban conurbations, a hub of education, and an important business center. However, once you scratch the surface, the city becomes significantly more than another bustling metropolis. Poznań is home to a plethora of historic and cultural references.
Amid the many modern buildings and high-rise apartments, the city also showcases an eclectic mix of Baroque, Gothic and neoclassical architecture. There are many Budynek zabytkowy (listed buildings) and Pomnik historii (historic monuments) scattered around in the city, the ownership of which comes with certain obligations and restrictions.
On second thoughts, I believe a major shopping mall attached to the main station complex in…

Reading scripts. Absolutely critical to learn the craft of screenwriting. The focus of this weekly series is a deep structural and thematic analysis of each script we read. Our daily schedule:
Monday: Scene-By-Scene BreakdownTuesday: Major Plot PointsWednesday: SequencesThursday: Psychological JourneyFriday: Takeaways
Today: Major Plot Points.
In every scene, something happens. A plot point is a scene or group of scenes in which something major happens, an event that impacts the narrative causing it to turn in a new direction.
A relevant anecdote. Years ago, I was on the phone with a writer discussing a script project. My son Will, who was about four years old at the time, must have been listening to me talking about “plot points” during the conversation because after I hung up, he asked, “Daddy, what’s a plop point?”
That’s in effect what a plot point is. It’s an event that ‘plops’ into the narrative and changes its course. So when you think Plot Point, think Plop Point!
The value of this exercise:
* To identify the backbone of the story structure.
* To examine each major plot point and see how it is effective as an individual event.
* To analyze the major plot points in aggregate to determine why they work together as the central plot.
This week: The Grand Budapest Hotel. You may download the script — free and legal — here: The Grand Budapest Hotel.
Screenplay by Wes Anderson, story by Wes Anderson & Hugo Guinness, inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig
IMDb plot summary: The adventures of Gustave H, a legendary concierge at a famous hotel from the fictional Republic of Zubrowka between the first and second World Wars, and Zero Moustafa, the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend.
Writing Exercise: Go through the scene-by-scene breakdown of The Grand Budapest Hotel and identify the major plot points. Post your thoughts in comments and we’ll see if we can come up with a consensus.
For Part 1, to read the Scene-By-Scene Breakdown created by Rob Hoskins, go here.
Tomorrow we consider the script’s structure in terms of its sequences.
If you’d like a PDF of The Grand Budapest Hotel, script scene-by-scene breakdown, go here.
Major kudos to Rob Hoskins for doing this week’s breakdown.
Tomorrow: We focus on the sequences in the script.
This series started here and we have 26 volunteers to do scene-by-scene breakdowns of contemporary movie scripts. The scripts we have already analyzed are in italics.

If you’d like to participate and do a scene-by-scene breakdown yourself, please indicate which script in comments or email me. We are using scripts available on our site here. Note some of the 2014 scripts are now available there including Belle, Birdman, Boyhood, Calvary, Get On Up, Gone Girl, How To Train Your Dragon 2, Kill The Messenger, Locke, St. Vincent, The Boxtrolls, The Fault In Our Stars, The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Theory of Everything, and Wild.
For new volunteers and those who have already volunteered, but not sent me a breakdown yet, please do so as soon as possible. Thanks!
Circling back to where we started, reading scripts is hugely important. Analyzing them even more so. If you want to work in Hollywood as a writer, you need to develop your critical analytical skills. This is one way to do that.
So seize this opportunity and join in the conversation!
I hope to see you in comments about this week’s script: The Grand Budapest Hotel.Comment Archive

Ever wondered how to draw a map of less common geographical areas? And color them based on some data? This pair of tutorials shows how to build this from scratch! First, you need to construct the border of your polygons — Part 1 is about this task. After that you need to create a map, and color those polygons according to some value of your interest. That will be shown in Part 2.
Part 1 of this tutorial is available here.
There are many tutorials on the internet for drawing maps in Python, even more sophisticated maps like heatmaps (where heat is basically the density of points in an area) or choropleth maps (where polygons are colored according to some arbitrary value). However, these tutorials are mainly done on states of the United States. View some great ones with plot.ly or an also otherwise superb one with folium. For the US, these packages have some convenience methods, but for the rest of the world, they’re of little use. Alternatively, they are based on some accidentally available json file like this one with Altair. Obviously, these are not general solutions to the problem of creating a map of some areas of your choice. I aim to give a general solution in these articles.
In this second part you will:
The code is also available on GitHub:
github.com
A GeoJson is actually a JSON file with some predetermined structure. The function above generates a GeoJSON file from a list of points by JSON dumping a dictionary formatted like a GeoJSON file. In these dictionaries, there are only 3 keys: lat, lon and name. Lat and lon stand for the coordinates, while name identifies the shape that the point belongs to. The order of these dictionaries in the list is also critical, you can read about this in the first part of this tutorial.
GeoDataFrames are a subclass of classic `pandas` DataFrames with a special column. This special column, geometry contains all the information that makes this DataFrame geo-aware. A GeoDataFrame object can be easily created from a GeoJSON file, you can add additional data to polygons easily, and just as easily convert it back to a GeoJSON file for visualization purposes.
In this snippet to the left centroids are added to each polygon. By this, we can add a nice marker to the centroid’s location depicting information about the polygon - in this case, the district. Just as easily as this, other data can be added using a plain pandas merge. Here, income tax per capita data is added to each polygon!
The creation of the map consists of 4 important steps:
Firstly, map creation is just as easy as it seems. You should provide a starting position, a starting zoom, and a tiles argument which is responsible for the basic design of your map. Be aware, that folium expects coordinates in latitude, longitude order!
Secondly, creating the choropleth is also easy, but it requires a neatly structured GeoJSON file. The parameters of the choropleth method speak for themselves, but you can refer to the documentation if something is not clear. This creates a layer where polygons are colored according to income tax per capita data — the more the greener, the less the yellower.
Thirdly, A FeatureGroup object is created. This object consist of Marker objects signalling each district’s name and the respective income tax per capita value to give the reader exact amounts apart from the color coding from choropleth. Lastly, LayerControl is added to the map in order to make it possible to show or hide layers, such as the choropleth or the FeatureGroup layer.
Finally, the map can be saved and the created .html file opened using your browser. You can find it on my github, in the outputs folder, but here is a snippet of it:
The main takeaway here is that in creating a beautiful choropleth map — just like in any data science project — data preparation takes around 90% of the effort. We got to know OpenStreetMap data structures and the Overpass API, and solved an interesting problem in Part 1. In Part 2, using GeoDataFrames made it easier to add information to our GeoJSON files and maps. It is also clear for me, that if you are creating maps in Python, folium is the way to go. As you can see, creating a map can be a one-liner, and creating choropleth maps or showing markers with html popups are really easy with folium.

I knew so much, when I was living in Budapest thirty years ago. And not only a lot more Hungarian than I know today.
I knew about the national poet and revolutionary Sándor Petöfi and about playwright and author Ferenc Molnár, after whom I name the fictitious Molnár Club in Birds of Passage. I still know a bit about them, and you may know of them, too.
In 1990 I was hearing a lot of talk in our Budapest social circle about the poet and playwright János Pilinszki, who had died about 10 years earlier and was still revered. He would definitely be on my fictional playwright Gábor’s mind.
And back then I knew about Gyula Krúdy, too; I’d even seen the acclaimed 1972 Zoltán Huszárik film Szindbád based on his work. I liked the idea that down-and-out Kalliopé – my favourite character in the novel – would think so longingly of the bone soup that figures in the film.
But I’d forgotten all about Pilinszki and Krúdy by the time I was rereading Birds of Passage this spring. Their names had become as foreign to me as they may be to you. I had to Google them to figure out why I’d included them in the novel, what they add to the characterization of Gábor and Kalliopé, and how I wanted to create a sense of the Budapest cultural milieu of the time.
I had no great hopes for Birds of Passage when I was writing it, and it had become too close to me for me to see it clearly when I finished it. I was thrilled when Karen Haughian of Signature Editions (then Nuage) wanted to publish it in 1993, and surprised when the review copies she sent out included one to the Times Literary Supplement.
And I did get lots of reviews, even as an unknown and unheralded writer.
The Globe and Mail was reviewing first novels in those days, CBC Radio discussed them on air, and publications like Books in Canada (now defunct) published thoughtful pieces unimaginable today — and paid the reviewers small but useful sums for doing so. I was the cover story in Hour magazine, also long-defunct, and I was interviewed by Shelagh Rogers.
Publishing a novel is nerve-wracking, and publicising a first novel is like having ball lightning in your kitchen. The work you have been obsessing over for years is out in the world – and being read by people you know and people you don’t know. They all have opinions of it, and some will tell you what they think, and who knows what they’ll say? Most will say little, if they say anything at all, and there’s no way of knowing if that’s even worse.
And then there’ll be the reviews – and far more people will read those than ever read your book.
An awful lot depends on reviews, which is the main reason for lamenting how few there now are.
I read the reviews of Birds of Passage with trepidation and astonishment.
The Globe’s was among the first:“Leith handles emotional crisis adroitly, without being clichéd. Her prose style is observant, quick and spare.” That was okay, pretty good, really.
Speaking on “The Arts Tonight” on CBC Radio, author Antanas Sileika praised the book in extravagant terms: “If you like Milan Kundera, if you like Vaclav Havel, you’re going to love this novel.”
Books in Canada described my novel as “remarkable” and published a long and thoughtful review article:
“Because Birds of Passage is a very sophisticated book, the title cuts many ways. The various birds that inhabit apartments, tunnels, mines, and nests enrich the story without intruding on it: suggestions of freedom and confinement, of beauty and fragility, rise naturally into the narrative. Moreover, because Gabor is a writer, Leith is able to comment playfully on her own creation. The novel’s ending seemed a touch contrived, but in a book of such varied delights this is a very small quibble. Leith has the gifts of a natural storyteller.”
The Times Literary Supplement took its time (its review appeared in 1994), but was well worth the wait:
“Hungary 1990 — with dissident lives redundant after the defeat of Communism, market prices making beggars of the population and foreign feminism knocking rudely at the door — is the setting for this excellent first novel. Birds of Passage explores the tenuous relationship between a Canadian couple and their Hungarian neighbours. Linda Leith is perceptive and never sentimental about the role Hungary plays in the lives of the Canadians, Alice and Daniel.
“Across the street from them, the playwright, Gabor, a romantic, who has mostly escaped reality by living the cloak-and-dagger existence of an underground political activist, cannot settle down to domestic responsibility; his apartment is full of sparrows trapped by the closed windows.
“Leith is good on the claustrophobic, old-fashioned feel of Central Europe, with its male heroes, its sacred places and works of art which artificially perpetuate a culture shut off from the international mainstream. Hungarian men in particular are so well adapted to the cage that when released they can barely survive. Alice, who has a strong character and appalling clothes sense, is impressive. Leith has that cool, precise way with the passions that makes one think of Alison Lurie.”
I had read only one book by Alison Lurie, whom The New York Times described as a “tart-voiced novelist of manners.” I didn’t see Birds of Passage as a novel of manners, but I was delighted with my allegedly “cool, precise way with the passions.”
TLS reviews were unsigned back then, and I did wish (and I still wish) I knew who had written this. Whoever it had clearly made the acquaintance of one or two Central European men.
I also wish I’d written to these and other reviewers to tell them how much I appreciated their comments on my book. I was a novice, and I didn’t know I could do that.
Getting a great review is one of the joys of becoming a writer – but then I got a letter from an outraged Hungarian émigrée who didn’t like my book at all.
This woman sang the praises of her homeland — and heartily wished that Birds of Passage had done the same. She deplored characters in my novel that she found unsavoury, including dear Kalliopé — and protested I’d sold Hungary short.
I didn’t agree then, and I don’t agree now, for a novel is not a travel brochure, and Alison Lurie is hardly the only novelist who can be tart-voiced. As Mavis Gallant once put it, “No writer calls a truce.”
But I am grateful to this woman for her letter. Hers was the response to Birds of Passage that did most to convince me I’d done my job as a novelist.

Hansje van Halem gave an amazing and very inspiring lecture during the 8th edition of Graphifest in the Design Terminal on 11 November 2014. After her talk she was so kind and answered my questions.
It’s always good to meet a person who is so passionate and enthusiastic when it comes to talking about his/her job. Dutch graphic and book designer Hansje van Halem, who has studied at Gerrit Rietveld Academy and has been working as a freelancer since graduation, is such a person. She used to hate typography because of the rules, but since she can work freely and do experiments she introduces their wonderful creations to the world regularly.
First of all, thank you for your lecture, it was really great. You have mentioned a lot of things regarding your career so I would be interested in the beginnings now. How and when did you first meet design? Did you actually want to be a designer when you were a child?One of my first memories thinking about my future can be dated back to when I was around 8 years. It was when we were taught how to draw perspective by using a ruler; we drew lines that looked endless. I remember making those drawings and thinking: I would like to have a job where I could use a ruler. I have realised now that I have a job for which I can use a ruler as it’s about measuring and calculation.
I also remember, at some point being ten or eleven, I wanted to be a theatre or movie director. I think that also makes sense because I should make a lot of decisions and to do a lot of processing.
It also has to be mentioned that both of my parents are artists so I grew up in an environment where my father had his studio next to our house and my mother had her atelier inside the house. So I was always surrounded by people making stuff and by material and equipment. I didn’t grow up like going to museums all the time but I did grow up in an environment where if I had an idea it was okay to cut and make something. I also remember begging my father: I had a huge stack of paper, and I would beg my father if he could put it under my mother’s sewing machine. It had to be sewed in the middle, and then I folded and filled the book. Additionally, as a kid, I loved the typewriter, I used it to create books.
You also said that you hated typography, however, the Netherlands is famous for type design and letters, so I’m wondering how it was possible.I started art school when I was 19 or 20; I went to a really formal one where they said: “These are the rules, this is how you should do it. When you do it differently, you do it wrong.” Moreover, I was a kid of an artist, my mother was also a teacher in a different art school, and I knew that art/design is always about pushing boundaries, looking for differences in things. At my school they didn’t teach this way of designing, it was all about rules, and in order to do a good job you had to live up to them.
Personally, I was too afraid, I knew if I made an S, then it had to be according to the rules. Then I changed school and went to this more Bauhaus type of working with teachers like Experimental Jetset, (Good)Will Holder, Jop van Bennekom and Gerard Unger. They were all so secure of their own work, that they easily gave space to their students. They would not give you an assignment like “create an S”, but said like “do a project with numbers”. I could just loose my imagination into looking at their systems. In addition to that, I could also find the space to experiment and to find out what’s right or wrong on my own without having a teacher saying this is right and this is wrong.
Do you think education is necessary, I mean does one have to go to school to be a good graphic designer?Of course, there are people who don’t have education, but I don’t know how anyone could afford not to spend four years full-time with so many professionals dedicated to this specific topic. You can learn so much, and you can have such a great time. If you do it on your own with a job on aside, I don’t think you get this level of knowledge and practice. I wouldn’t be a graphic designer without education, as I couldn’t have learnt so much in such a short time. Of course, you learn more after school than during school but that’s not the same.
You have also mentioned that you have your studio in your apartment. Do you think it’s a good idea to have a studio in one’s home?I forgot to tell… I worked from my student room in 2003–2004. It started to feel really weird when I started to have clients over. Sometimes they would leave late to get the work finished and there would be only a short period of time between the moment when the client left and the moment when I got undressed to go to sleep. Time to get some studio space!
After having a studio for a couple of years I was fed up and moved my work space back into my (now bigger) house in 2009. That was a very productive period of two years. I took in an intern and started a gallery space in my living room showcase cabinet. But when I was sitting on the edge of my bed having dinner, I realised I needed my house back. Again, I started looking for a studio in 2011, and now I have a really nice one about 15 minutes away from my house. It’s good to have a start and a finish every day even if the day takes very long. It’s also nice that when I come home there isn’t a room full of sketches.
Do you work alone or sometimes within a group maybe?I work alone. Sometimes I need help but this is always on different levels. If I’m busy and some correction rounds need to be done regarding a book I know somebody who is more precise than I am so I just hire her. But I do everything alone basically. One of my wishes for my next life is to be a designer duo because it’s kind of lonely sometimes.
How many projects do you usually work on at the same time? I assume creating a book it’s a great amount of work.Oh, yes. It can be zero projects so I make my own stuff but it can be 5 or 7 projects at the same time. Of course, they don’t have the deadline all at once because it would be impossible to complete all the tasks, so it has to be one project starting, one waiting for reply, etc. I think I do my best when I have multiple things do to because otherwise I would start to make a big deal out of making decisions.
I’m just curious, do you use a calendar or do you know all the deadlines by heart?I keep many of them in my head, I usually know that I have a deadline next week.
How many projects are you working on right now?I am in some kind of troubles this week as I’m not working here. I’m getting a solo exhibition in Eindhoven; I’m making a spin-off of my publication, it will be 48 pages instead of 484 and it will be cheaper as well.
Yesterday I was in a supermarket in Budapest, and the printer called me and said: “We are running out of time. I’m afraid we are not gonna make it.” I was like “I’m in Budapest, I cannot do anything”. So it was a bit stressful. I was invited to design a fence for a company in Holland, which is a different thing, it’s working with material. I’m doing a poster design for a gallery located in Northern Holland. In fact, I just finished it last week, but I know there is a next one so I’ve started experimenting. This is something I do for free and I really enjoy. They always give me nice reviews. Of course, in between I make a diploma for students, and I’m working on logos for some individuals. So there are lot of stuff going on…
You work a lot. Can you stop working at some point? I’m asking because you’ve also said during your lecture that you do repetitious work in your free time.Yes, but I love watching TV as well. For the first 5 years I was working non-stop, later I realised there’ll always be work so it’s okay to take a break, it’s very normal to have weekends. There was a short period during the crisis when I was getting less money so I could not hire people and I was working during weekends, but I’m back on track now.
And finally, how do you like Budapest?For me it’s a cultural shock. I was just getting on the plane as it was taking a train to another city in Holland but getting out of the plane I had to realise this is not Holland. I didn’t really have time to think about being here, though. Today I was walking around, and first you go to the tourist layer and looking all the windows, but then I was taken to the House of Terror, which, of course, changes perspectives. You get the contrast between all the beautiful, decorated ceilings you could see in the buildings and this horrible history… And you meet nice people as well. I’ve been here for 30 hours maybe so I cannot say so much but it’s very intriguing.
You should come back later on!I’m going to treat my mother on a weeklong holiday in Budapest. I’m just thinking of stuff what we should do.
By the way, do you know anything about Hungarian graphic design?Only what I’ve seen on Graphifest, and, of course, I’be been looking around in the city as for graphic design it’s very important to get a platform, a space to show design. I’m just wondering what the operation spaces of Hungarian designers are.
They usually open a studio…Yes, but I mean in the street. I’ve seen posters but I don’t think those are designed by those people. Maybe different types of agencies…
There is an exhibition called ARC that has a theme every year, for instance.Yes, but for me exhibitions are designs for designers, however, designers should also meet clients who will hire them. Right now my problem is who will hire me, I might be invited to more exhibitions than for work. It’s lovely that people appreciate what you are doing and want to hang and show your work to other people but you need to make a living as well.
Do you think it should be offline, I’m just wondering, because you can be hired based on your portfolio on Behance/website, for example?I think your work should be everywhere. I’m on Cargo Collective because it has a gallery system so every time I do something I can put them in the front row. I get clients from there, and also from Instagram.
I don’t know how people did it before because when I graduated there was no Facebook or Tumblr, people did have websites but I have no idea how they did it. There were a lot of requests for portfolio books, though. There was always a book being published, and an art director called you that he/she wanted you in that book. Exposure is very important. I also have friends and colleagues who have maximum exposures but no paid assignments. So they get invited to Japan, for example, but nobody calling them saying: “Hello, we have some money, can you create something for us?” It would be nice to be found by an agent or something. I can see on Instagram that an agency is following me and I’m thinking: Oh, interesting, maybe they want me.

Budapest is Hungary’s capital and largest city. It is by far the most visited city in the country, with millions of tourists landing every year. It also happens to be one of my most favorite cities. That being said, I am a traveler and not a tourist.
As such, every time I plan to travel, the idea is to go beyond the usual. In the case of Hungary, it is no different. Every occasion I venture out to this beautiful European country, I behave very unlike me. I make at least a couple of impromptu decisions during every vacation, and this attitude has helped me explore a lot of the country. This trip was no different.
For starters, on this occasion, I had not landed in Budapest and planned further. Instead, I was on my way to the hitherto unexplored western part of Hungary, having flown in to neighboring Austria. While I landed at Vienna, it was not going to be my base for the next few days. On the contrary, I had towards Sopron.
In the eight days that followed, I ended up exploring Sopron, Szombathely, Kőszeg and the surrounding countryside in the Győr-Moson-Sopron County and the Vas County. All the cities I ended up visiting also have a German name. So it is Ödenburg for Sopron…

I was following our tour guide through Budapest’s Liberty Square when he stopped the group and pointed to a larger-than-life bronze statue. “Do you know who this is?”
We shuffled closer, and I gasped. “Ronald Reagan? You have a statue of Ronald Reagan in your capitol?”
My next question echoed what many of us were thinking. “Why?”
The tour guide beamed. “Hungarians believe Ronald Reagan had a lot to do with the fall of Communism in our country. His famous words, ‘Take down that wall,’ started the whole thing rolling.”
The guide continued, “There are many who believe his economic policies led to the downfall of the Soviet Union. The people wanted to show their appreciation for your former president’s efforts in ending the Cold War.”
As I spent more time in Budapest, I noticed a recurring theme. The Hungarians felt oppressed and stripped of their rights when the Soviet Union controlled their country, and feelings…

They say there are two types of people in Budapest, those who live in Buda and those who want to live in Buda.
Well, after my first trip to this stunning city with my high school best friend, Kat, I can see why. Buda, with its rolling hills and picturesque skyline, is undeniably the prettier side of the Danube, but I quickly fell for both Buda and Pest.
There’s a certain magic to the way the two sides blend, separated by the wide, winding river but bound together by history and charm.
From the moment we arrived, we were swept up in Budapest’s grandeur. The architecture alone felt like it was trying to impress us. It succeeded. Every street corner seemed to shout, “Look at me! I’m outrageously elegant!” with good reason.
The city is a feast for the eyes, with its majestic buildings, intricate monuments, and statues that could rival those in any European capital.

Wes Anderson’s “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” released in 2014, is a cinematic masterpiece that defies categorization. With its distinctive visual style, quirky characters, and intricate narrative structure, the film takes audiences on a whimsical journey through a world that is both charmingly surreal and emotionally resonant. As a testament to Anderson’s unique directorial vision, “The Grand Budapest Hotel” has left an indelible mark on the world of cinema.
A Visual Delight
From the moment the film begins, viewers are enveloped in a visually enchanting universe that could only have sprung from the mind of Wes Anderson. The movie’s meticulously crafted set designs, intricate color palettes, and meticulously arranged compositions create a mesmerizing experience. The Grand Budapest Hotel itself, with its pink façade and ornate interiors, serves as both a central character and a metaphor for the film’s whimsical allure.
Anderson’s keen attention to detail extends beyond the set design. The use of miniatures and practical effects adds a layer of tangible magic to the story, transporting the audience to a realm that feels both nostalgic and otherworldly. Each frame is a work of art, and the film’s distinctive visual style is as much a character as any of the actors.
An Ensemble of Eccentric Characters
At the heart of “The Grand Budapest Hotel” is an ensemble cast that brings the film’s eccentric characters to life with remarkable depth and charisma. The inimitable Ralph Fiennes leads the pack as the charismatic and witty concierge, Monsieur Gustave H. His magnetic performance adds a layer of charm and complexity to the character, making him simultaneously hilarious and heartwarming.
The supporting cast is equally impressive, with memorable performances from Saoirse Ronan, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Tilda Swinton, Jeff Goldblum, and many others. Each character, no matter how minor, contributes to the film’s rich tapestry, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.
A Narrative Maze
What sets “The Grand Budapest Hotel” apart is its intricate narrative structure. The film unfolds as a story within a story within a story, skillfully weaving together different timelines and perspectives. This layered approach not only keeps the audience engaged but also deepens the emotional resonance of the film.
The narrative structure is further enhanced by the film’s playful tone and dark humor. Anderson effortlessly transitions between moments of slapstick comedy and poignant introspection, creating a balance that keeps the audience emotionally invested while never taking itself too seriously.
Themes of Nostalgia and Loss
Beneath the film’s whimsy and humor lies a profound exploration of themes such as nostalgia, loss, and the passage of time. Through the character of Zero Moustafa (played by F. Murray Abraham and Tony Revolori), the audience witnesses the changing landscape of Europe and the hotel’s decline from its glamorous heyday. This melancholic undercurrent adds depth to the film, reminding us that even the most fantastical worlds are not immune to the effects of time.
Conclusion
“The Grand Budapest Hotel” is a cinematic gem that continues to captivate audiences with its unique blend of visual artistry, quirky characters, and intricate storytelling. Wes Anderson’s directorial vision shines through in every frame, creating a world that feels simultaneously nostalgic and fresh. The film’s ability to evoke laughter, wonder, and introspection is a testament to its enduring appeal. As we revisit the charming corridors of the Grand Budapest Hotel, we are reminded that, in the world of cinema, true magic knows no bounds.

In Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel, the moments of absurdity are essential to understanding the humanity of the story and how our relationships with others are what defines our lives. Anderson is sure to never spend too long on one tragic moment alone and tends to bundle emotion, comedy, and danger together in a scene. These moments of comedy act as a device to distance the viewer from the dark realities of the story and are key to making the film enjoyable instead of altogether sad.
From the moment the film starts, we are distanced from the story. We see a young girl visit a tribute to the author of our tale, who then discusses the true story of his book as it was told to him by Zero in his later years. We are quickly aware of the lenses we are seeing the story through and the fact that it is a story. It is through the form of a story that we can pay attention to the greater themes that are discussed about the world and the relationships that develop.
When Gustave receives news of Madame D., he immediately heads off to the funeral, and abruptly takes Zero with him. “We must go to her.” “We must?” “She needs me, and I need you to help me with my bags and so on.” Although this is the way in which he asks Zero to go with him and has him pack wine and his bag for him, it becomes clear that Gustave wants to have someone by his side. Like Zero, Gustave is alone in this world and has no one else that he would trust to go with him. Gustave clearly feels a strong bond with Zero early on and treats him as a friend once they are outside the hotel, but Zero does not feel that same way immediately. Gustave pours him wine (which Zero does not drink) and plans that if things were to go south, they should run away together. Gustave even chooses Zero as his heir to his estate when he is gone. Zero is the closest thing that Gustave has to family and the hotel is the closest thing either of them has to a home. He admits to Zero (on Madame D’s death), “I blame myself. She tried to warn me…but I didn’t listen…There’s really no point to doing anything in life because it’s all gone in the blink of an eye.” This is a truly dreary perspective from Gustave that he counters with telling Zero how good she was in bed. They are then interrupted by the militiamen who enter the train and who Gustave tries to charm and joke with as he would with anyone else, to no avail. After they are assaulted when Zero’s papers are not in order, it is Gustave’s charm after all that saved them. Heckels telling Zero, “Your companion was very kind to me when I was just a lonely little boy,” showing Zero how, while his charms do not always work, Gustave can make a difference in people’s lives by treating them with care and respect. It is through their performance of careful care as hotel employees that they are both detached and closer than anyone else, and, by sharing this secret, Zero allows Gustave to be the closest thing to “real” that is possible.
When Gustave is arrested and in prison, he continues his role as concierge. Anderson highlights this role with the comedic lines of Gustave as he rolls his food cart past each of the cells, offering slop like it is fine cuisine; even salting it for a prisoner. He’s surrounded by hardened criminals and fighting, yet all he wants to do is make life as good for these people as he possibly can. He has Mendl’s smuggled in and shares it with his fellow prisoners, the group including Pinky who he got in an altercation with early on, the altercation itself showing that Gustave can break his act of charm when it suits him and that his desire for control is stronger than his facade. The group has even discussed that he’s “a real straight fellow,” and, “one of us now.” Gustave is delighted and surprised, as he is probably not thanked in the same way for his services in the hotel, as well as the fact that he is just treating the prisoners the way he would anyone else, likely seeing them in a very similar light, saying that even, “The most dreadful and unattractive person only needs to be loved and they will open up like a flower.” Living for the hotel and acting as a concierge are Gustave’s sole purposes in life and are why he does not let go of his duties even while behind bars, giving letters to Zero to read on his behalf to take care of the hotel the way that he would, even giving poems to recite just as he would to remind them that he and the hotel are one in the same. Gustave’s idea to have the digging tools smuggled in with the pastries, that the guard cannot bear to destroy, acts as a metaphor for the charms and kindness of Gustave being the only way to combat the brutishness and bad in the world.
When Gustave escapes through the sewer with the prisoners and meets with Zero, he is quite the opposite of his charming self and is in the shoes of the concierge as a boss and not as a companion. Zero has no disguises for them, no safe house and has not brought a bottle of l’air de panache for Gustave to freshen up with. While not essential to their plan, these things were all included in how Gustave would have done them himself had he been in control. This lack of authority in the moment and his distance from the hotel trigger him to go off on Zero. He condemns him for coming to Zubrowska as an immigrant, saying that if he does not know how to act that they’d be better off if he went back to where he came from. When Zero rebuts with the story of how his father and family were killed and how the violence of the war caused him to leave, Gustave realizes the error of his ways and apologizes, “On behalf of the hotel… Don’t make excuses for me. I owe you my life. You are my dear friend and protégé and I am very proud of you.” What seems to be a very low point of Gustave’s character has a sudden redemption arc when he realizes that these material things don’t matter at all if he hadn’t had Zero to help him. This is the turning point for Gustave seeing Zero as a friend or brother and the only relationship that truly matters to him. This moment is essential to the later scene where Gustave officiates Zero and Agatha’s wedding as well as Gustave’s final moments in the train car where all three have become a family and would fight for each other.
In all, The Grand Budapest Hotel acts as a tale of light within the darkness. It shows how stories of individuals and their relationships can make dire times appear much brighter. Anderson uses the bonds of Zero and Gustave, and later the addition of Agatha, to present a realistic portrayal of how life goes on when tragedy occurs and that all you can do is laugh and try to make the best of your situation. Anderson carefully weaves in the exaggeration of comedic situations and actions with the grim reality of Gustave being framed, people being murdered, and the government falling to a new regime in just a way that makes you think about what you’re watching and makes you question why you feel the way you do. Anderson’s narrative works because, before the viewer even realizes it, they are shown loyalty, love, war, and loss and are told to face it just as the characters are, head-on.

🏩✨A number of years ago, upon writing this review, we had decided to spend the tenth day of August in the spa town of Nebelsbad below the Alpine Sudetenwaltz — and had taken up rooms in the Grand Budapest — a picturesque, elaborate, and a still widely-celebrated establishment. 🗓📝🏔We expect some of you will know it. 🌸🎟
After boarding the LFC Express, we have finally arrived at our destination: The Grand Budapest Hotel, with the Buda-best service, Mr. Gustave- approved! Read our review as we reminisce on this classic cinematic masterpiece!

Wes Anderson’s ‘The Grand Budapest Hotel’ is well positioned to win some Oscars on Sunday. It received nine Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Picture. The film’s editing has received widespread praise and Editor Barney Pilling is nominated in that category (his first Oscar nomination). Pilling’s work on ‘Budapest’ also recently won him an ACE Eddie Award for Best Edited Feature, Comedy/Musical. Pilling’s past projects include ‘An Education,’ ‘Never Let Me Go,’ and ‘One Day.’ He’s currently working on ‘Suffragette’ starring Meryl Streep and Helena Bonham Carter.
Here’s our Q&A on ‘The Grand Budapest Hotel’:
What inspired you to become an editor?
I’ve always loved watching films throughout my life and I’ve always had a creative drive…but I’d have to say that the sci-fi and war films of my childhood really fired my imagination in a way that little else did and probably set the foundation for a life of make-believe. ‘Star Wars,’ Spielberg, ‘Bladerunner,’ ‘2001 A Space Odyssey,’ ‘Alien,’ ‘Guns of Navarone,’ ‘Where Eagles Dare,’ ‘Bridge on the River Kwai’ and so on.
What’s it like to work on a Wes Anderson film?
It’s incredibly hard work and truly exhilarating, all at the same time! It’s also a privilege for me to work with so many outstanding craftspeople and performers.
What were the biggest challenges with editing the film?
Probably pulling in so many elements from so many different sources, studios and countries for the action pieces. We had green screen main unit, miniature model and landscape builds in Berlin, stop motion puppetry happening in London, and Look FX tinkering away in LA — so pulling all this into focus with the right rhythm was a long and tough process. Also technically really demanding of the editorial team and the Avid Software — many, many video layers!
Both you and your wife are in the business. Do you discuss work at home?
Yes! Lots. It’s hard not too. You have to be very passionate about what you are doing to succeed in the TV and Film industry, so it’s difficult to switch it off at home. Also, we end up being first audiences of our respective projects — bouncing things off each other — it’s nice.
Could you see yourself working with Wes Anderson again?
I hope so! I’m incredibly proud of the work we all did on that ‘Grand Budapest Hotel’ and have become close friends with many of my fellow craftspeople. These are feelings and relationships that of course anyone would want to repeat or perpetuate.

I have been pretty inactive on social media in the past few weeks because my phone was stolen while I was traveling in Budapest, Hungary. Losing your phone is very inconvenient in this day and age, when so much activity and business has moved to mobile platforms. Not having Google maps in my palm made navigation a bit more cumbersome, and many of my plane tickets and travel information were on my phone. I also couldn’t look up different restaurants to go and compare the reviews. Worst of all, I was cut off from the rest of the world as I couldn’t access my emails, texts, phone calls, social media, etc.
My first impression of Budapest was very positive. I liked how traditional Budapest is compared to other big cities in Europe, and the Hungarian culture is alive and thriving in this city. Many of the restaurants were over a hundred years old, serving traditional Hungarian cuisine the same way they had for centuries. There was a wide variety of meats, including goose, venison (deer meat), wild boar, duck, rabbit, etc., which I really appreciated because those types of meats are relatively rare in America and Western Europe, where people usually just eat chicken, beef, or pork for their protein. Moreover, prices in general were a lot lower in Budapest, although the exchange rate was pretty confusing because 1 US dollar is almost 300 Hungarian Forints (289.22 as of July 14, 2019). I…

October has always been my favorite month, filled with happiness, and fun, and began of the festival. But this October, we planned to do something different, So We decided to take our vacation to Budapest. We did not take a single vacation break this year which made us do something different, to feel like we did something this year apart from work or regular life.
Budapest the capital city of Hungary, is a town rich with history, beautiful breathtaking architecture, and unforgettable experiences.
But this trip was different from any other trip we had before because we ticked off one of the most thrilling items on our bucket list: skydiving.
I’ve always been drawn to the idea of flying, but nothing could prepare me for the rush of actually leaping from a plane at 10,000 feet. The sensation was beyond words. Budapest, with its stunning landscapes, became the perfect backdrop for…

We were awakened in the middle of the night on our European River Cruise by a loud noise, a shaking of the boat from left to right and back to left again, and the closet light flashing on and off as the door spontaneously opened and banged shut.
“What was that?” I asked my husband as I grabbed his arm. He looked out our glassed-in French Balcony. “We’re in a lock,” he said. “The boat must have hit the side of it.”
Within minutes, we were back to sleep. We had our safety drill early in the trip and no sirens went off nor was any announcement made — whatever it was, lock or no lock, we were safe.
When we planned our vacation traversing Europe on three iconic rivers — the Danube, Rhine, and Main — we had no idea we’d pass through so many locks.

Wes Anderson’s “The Grand Budapest Hotel” is colorful, quirky and almost surreal.
Behind Anderson’s detailed world is Marquette alumnus Adam Stockhausen, Comm ‘95.
Director Wes Anderson and Stockhausen looked at old hotels and other eastern European buildings to create the invented country of Zubrowka.
“The Grand Budapest Hotel” received nine Oscar nominations and won four of them.
Stockhausen took home his first Oscar for production design. He shares this award with set designer Anna Pinnock.
m.jsonline.com
He graduated from Marquette in 1995 with a degree in theater.
“He has that ability to wrap his mind around stuff and to get so engrossed in things that it really turns out some wonderful stuff,” Marquette Theatre Artistic director Debra Krajec told Fox6 News.
Stockhausen is the first Marquette graduate to win an Academy Award since Dom Ameche won for Best Supporting Actor in 1986.
Stochkausen was previously nominated for his work in the 2012 film “12 Years a Slave.” He has already worked on two films since “The Grand Budapest Hotel.”

The city smelled of days’ worn clothes. Streets are littered with piss stains, cigarette butts and small piles of dog shit. Budapest features a rich history, the majesty of time immemorial is written into ornate buildings riddled with bullet holes, and in somber pockmarked faces of passerbys. Ambulances in a foreign language squeal in the distance, like a whining dog. Trams charge up and murmur in electric tongues. Dark-haired people with thin lips and absent eyes mix into the landscape.
I get the sense of an underlying hardship, that people are struggling (later confirmed by talking with locals). Maybe it’s winter malady, absent of snow and joy. The only people laughing loudly are the tourists, who are everywhere; Flaunting their unburdened spirit, unbridled by work or school or obligations (here on holiday for cheap thrills). To walk down the sidewalk is to island hop between unrecognizable dialects. You know a tourist by: Loud chittering dispersed amid large flocks with cocked heads; raised eyes and abrupt stops to review digital maps; movement that is too fast or slow for the pace of the street.
I’m not sure what I was looking for in my trip, and I wouldn’t say that I’ve “learned about myself” or “grown” per se. I would like to continue streaking away from a traditional career in America; I want to let go of the rope on the bunny slope. I don’t desire being different as a matter of course, but simply following others is not the way towards individuation.
I do seek: Authenticity. As Dōgen, a Japanese Buddhist priest, writer, poet, philosopher, and founder of the Sōtō school of Zen in Japan, said, “We study the self to forget the self. When you forget the self, you can become one with the ten thousand things.” And as the Buddah proclaimed, “kill the Buddah.” Or, your ultimate goal is to make your own way. Guides, inspiration, models offer signposts, but the landscape is vast and inherently unique for each person; I intend to get off the trail, even if I need to come back and follow the blazes from time to time.
Towards the end of his life, Carl Jung stated that our greatest adventure today is in the exploration of our unconscious. Everything else is a distraction; to know ourselves is more important, meaningful, and challenging than say, colonizing Mars — while I appreciate the pursuit it seems more like an act of running away from the real meaning here on Earth (and from within ourselves).
In the Western world, we live in a culture of (inter-)connection in the form of: sociability and social networks; emails and Twitter streams; a prizing of extraversion; boredom and distraction. And yet loneliness is both ubiquitous and a condemnation. Jung would classify this as the Shadow of our collective Ego, because consciousness exists for individuals and societies, and we are very good at denying ourselves and each other at scale. To deny your Self is to empower the Shadow, which is the root for maladies of the human personality.
Tidying things up: In a world with excess information most of us are sponges, super-saturated with no spare volume for our own understanding… what would happen if we were all suddenly wrung dry?
AARON GERRY tries not to take himself too seriously, despite what the content may suggest. He enjoys pen and paper, perambulating, and donuts. Many donuts. Oh and writing. Speaking of which, his work can be found in journals and publications such as Chronogram, Lit Up, P.S. I Love You, The Creative Cafe, The Junction, and others. If you like this piece please do 👏clap👏 along!

A book that made me book a flight to Budapest. I guess it was one of the best decisions. Right now, crying here in “Vinikli” while enjoying Hungarian wine, still feeling so happy that I am here. Thank you Magda Szabó.
Oh, my heart. This book is why I’m sitting here in Budapest, crying my eyes out as I read the final pages. What a story… my heart is shattered into pieces. My dear Etelka. My dear Iza.
My journey with Hungarian literature began with Sándor Márai’s Portraits of a Marriage, which remains one of my favorite books. But this one, written by the talented Magda Szabó, is just as incredible. Reading the final pages in the very place where it all unfolded is truly a magical experience.
In Etelka, I saw so much of my own mother, and in the things Iza did thinking she was helping her mother, but slowly, unintentionally causing her to wither like a flower, I unfortunately found myself in her.
After my family lost their first child, perhaps because I am the only child my family had later in life, I empathized with the book deeply — I’m not sure — but it touched me profoundly. I felt an incredible sense of regret for every time I was unsympathetic toward my mother. At the same time, just like Etelka, Iza’s life was also changed, and I can truly relate to the turmoil and confusion she went…

Budapest is the capital and this was my second time here. This time the stay was in Hotel Danubius Helia at the Karpat Utca, on the banks of river Danubius. You get a view of Margaret island from the hotel rooms. I visited the island on the Day 1 evening, people usually go there for jogging, having alcohol at the restaurant, watching the ruins. There is also a presedved bio diversity, a few animals kept in there covered from all sides.
I took a walking tour on the second day and they take you through: the Parliament, American Embassy, Heroes square, Ruin Bars, the Jewish synagogue
Its a very small country in the Central Europe, part of which also meets the Adriatic Sea in the south. Almost any part can be reached in a couple of hours from the capital: Ljubljana. If compared, the country must be smaller than Indian state Madhya Pradesh.
Unlike rest of the European countries, the capital doesn’t have Tram trains and Subways as public transport. You can only use the local buses. In fact if you’re a tourist, every tourist spot can be covered by walk. Its all within a square kilometer from the main bus station. Preseren Square, Ljubljana castle, Dragon Bridge, National & University Library, Restaurants, Market are the only places that can be visited or are a must visit. You won’t find Starbucks, Subway, KFC et cetera here in the capital. Luckily, we have McD, Pizza Hut, at least for the Vegetarians.
25 minutes of walk to the castle, mostly climbing, you get a very beautiful view of the city from the top. There are multiple entries and exits at the bottom where you can start your climbing. You can also take a Funicular railway for a return ticket of 6 Euros, to avoid walking. I preferred walking because thats what I’ve been doing since last 6 days perhaps to save a few Euros for the remaining tour. I’ve started liking to walk (a lot) now a days. You’ll see a bunch of private restaurants, pretty costly too, on the top part of the castle. This part, privatization at the world heritage sites, I really hate it.
Bled is a beautiful town 55 kimoleters away from the capital. Arriva is the transport company here which takes you there with a good frequency of buses, for every half an hour, charging 13 Euros for return. I had planned for only 1 day for Bled unknowing of its charm. One can spend like a week here if you plan to see it thoroughly. There’s a lake in the middle of the town with a small island which has a church. People usually take local ferries to reach there, the charge is 15 Euros for return. Its a wooden boat and the person ferrying us has to row using the oars in both hands, sounds like bit of a stamina work, right? To add to that, there were around 16 people on the boat.
Vintgar Klamm is a place from where you can start your walk through gorge, to the waterfall alongside the picturesque Radovna river. 2 Euros for a return ticket by bus from Bled and about 30 minutes to reach.
Its a beautiful walk with cold breezes and lushy green forest. You can also go near the water, drink it, sit there for some time unless you are making any risky move.
For solo travellers or not tourists, who do not want to spend a lot on stay, I would suggest booking Turn Hostel in Mala Ulica near the main bus station which is 5 minutes walking distance. They charge around 25 Euros per night plus 3 Euros environment tax. Also all tourist places in Ljubljana are at a walking distance.
After the beautiful trip of Slovenia, I then took a bus from the main bus station of Ljubljana to Marburg where I’ll be meeting my brother in law. It was a 17 hours of journey by Bus, I had booked a Flixbus through their app, it costed me 53 Euros. The bus was scheduled at 21:05.
The bus was a double decker Flixbus and it was running late by an hour as it had started from Zagreb. To my surprise, Buses in Europe run late too. I hadn’t booked a specific seat number, so boarded and searched for the best available seat for me on the upper half. It doesn’t matter to be seated in last seats in European countries as the roads and speed breakers are smooth enough. More importantly, buses are comparatively comfortable too. I got a window seat exactly above the rear tyre set. It was a semi sleeper and the journey was for the entire night. Phew!!
It reached on time to the Frankfurt bus station at around 9:00 am and I had a connecting bus at 11:00 am to Marburg. I walked in to a nearby hotel to enquire for using the washroom. 1 Euro was the charge. I quickly refreshed myself, enquired for the coffee at the reception but unfortunately they didn’t serve only coffee, I needed to take the entire buffet which I was not in the mood to. I decoded to take a walk around the bus station, it was a big place, with many shops, hotels, tram stations et cetera. I could even see an Indian restaurant across the road, but it would only open after I take my bus to Marburg.
“I don’t know where I’m going but I’m on my way”
Trip Route:
Mumbai — Vienna — Budapest — Ljubljana — Bled — Ljubljana— Marburg — Munich — Vienna — Mumbai

UPDATE: This is a fairly old article, since the 2015 instagram update various aspect ratios are allowed to upload, from 1.91:1 to 1:1 hooray for cinematographers and directors like Reed Morano or Emmanuel Lubezki. But that doesn’t mean this article is of no use, all the contrary, the quick lessons within still apply if you want to give that somewhat classic look to your instagram account, much better if you like the squared ratio photos, like many photographers of the minimalist style wave do.
Those who saw “The Grand Budapest Hotel” can agree with me that it was marvelous in many aspects: Oscar worthy direction, scenarios, music and many others. But for now, i’m writing about his cinematography/ photography direction by the hand of Robert D. Yeoman and how he and the movie can make you a better instagrammer.
When I just finished watching it for the first time, at the moment the credits were rolling I realized that the movie itself is, in a way, an awesome and inspiring example of Instagram photography.
The frames were composed with such taste and detail that the first thing I say to my friends about the movie is that “It’s visually incredible”; and perhaps, some part of that beauty it’s because of the unusual (almost squared) 1.37:1 aspect ratio used on most of the length of the film.
That unusual look gave the movie that 30's vintage film look that I found absolutely beautiful and, in fact, it’s very Instagram-like.
Note that Instagram uses a 1:1 Squared aspect ratio, not 1.37:1, but between 1.37:1 and 1:1 there isn’t a lot difference.
The following are some examples of the key aspects I was able to absorb from the movie.
The Grand Budapest Hotel teaches us that keeping in mind the frame when composing is the key, every line, every element and just about everything is in the tone and fits perfectly on his aspect ratio. (look at the courtains in the example or the columns in the first picture)
One of the primary reasons that most people post bad photos on Instagram is that they not compose their photos thinking “squared”, they aren’t thinking in 1:1 ratio, some people just take the pictures, as usual, in the aspect ratio the camera app is set (usually 2:3 or 16:9), forgetting the composition, and later they crop the photo in Instagram, well, that’s a mistake. Use an app like VSCO cam, the square guide feature within the app is meant for Instagram users, it helps a lot.
“Always think 1:1”
It’s all about giving your subject his space, the movie does this perfectly, sometimes with flat backgrounds, brighter backgrounds and not making the subject to absorb the entire frame.
Make it simple
Sometimes there will be a trashcan or a chair that will come out on your way, disbalancing your shot, and the best way to treat this is simply moving them away to have a better and cleaner composition. Or you can incorporate them to become a part of your shot, as I explain in the next point.
One thing I found curious, specially in this shot, is the fact that all the elements in the movie are in a certain position and place that it almost feels painted.
The movie with that single shot tells us a story, some kind of manhunt or investigation. Well, that’s what a great photo achieves, to make the public imagine the reason of every element on the shot.
Tell a story with your elements
Just arrange the objects to give balance to your shot. And as the example shot shows: A little dramatic light always help.
This is actually very trendy among the photography and design community, but i’m not aware of the name of the trend, if you know it please leave me a note →
This one is the key aspect to make your photos look like the work of a pro (while you become one). The movie gave special attention to achieve symmetry to their shots. Perhaps that’s the main aspect I loved about The Grand Budapest Hotel (visually speaking), and the reason that lead me to write this article.
Make your shot stable, be sure your camera is completely vertical or horizontal and look for guides to help you give symmetry to your shot (Look at how the black tiles at the example helps to center the shot.)
Take your time
I suggest not to tilt your photos. I’ve seen very few pics on Instagram that work with a tilted crooked angle, the 1:1 aspect ratio pairs better with a flat horizon line. So, unless you’re absolutely conviced that the tilted angle will work, try to avoid it.The symmetry is the best friend of the aspect I explain next.
This is the ultimate “cheat” to make your squared Instagram photos look awesome. The cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman without a doubt loves the perspectives and we have the joy to experience many scenes like this one in the movie. (Similar to the Stanley Kubrick style)
This style draws your attention into the picture, creates movement in it and, virtually commands you to pay attention to the subject.
Give movement to your shot
The lines are everything. Take the example shot as a simple guide. Corridors, bridges or train tracks are ideal scenarios; make your perspective lines go to the corners of the frame, make it symmetrical (as I explained in the previous point); put one main subject at the center of the frame (max two subjects); and simply enjoy the moment. You’ll see the results. Your photos are gonna get a lot of ❤ on Instagram.
Now it’s up to you. Watch the movie, get inspired, follow this path and start shooting, you’re gonna love all of it.
Please, don’t get me wrong, i’m not saying this is the only way to shine at Instagram, but it’s certainly a beautiful path.
Here are some real examples of successful instagrammers of this style, follow them for an extra dose of inspiration. I II III IV V (I love the third one)
Thank you for reading!
This is my very first article and if you recommend it that will mean a lot to me. Let me know if you liked it. ☺Apologies if something is misspelled, I’m not very fluent at english.Share this article wherever you like. Thanks.

Overwhelming, volatile, passionate, affectionate, dependable and adoring.
Her emotions, like a wild storm gathering on a calm horizon, erupt without warning, casting doubt on my capacity and worth as a parent.
Despite our frequent squabbles, my teenage daughter approached me in October with travel plans for Fall break that felt more like a polished closing argument in a presidential debate. She artfully outlined her reasons for the trip, highlighted how it could strengthen our bond, and delivered a persuasive appeal for me to step away from my relentless 9-to-5 grind — stirring a sense of intrigue and the promise of much-needed relaxation.
It left a mark that lingered in my thoughts, pulling me in until I finally gave in.
A few weeks later, we were soaring above the clouds, Budapest-bound, carried by the thrill of reconnecting with old friends.
We touched down just past midnight, stepping into Budapest’s deserted streets, where every shadow seemed to echo the 12 years, I once called this city home. Meanwhile, I rehearsed the apartment code like a sacred verse, fearing my dead phone would turn this arrival into a pilgrimage of memory.

It was her fifth new date in as many weeks, and none of them had been a success. The men all appeared very attractive and almost perfect matches on the screen of her mobile phone. In real life, however, there was always something a bit off. Sometimes more than a bit.
Tonight, it was Jeff. Jeff had potential. Definitely handsome. Probably hadn’t lied about his age. Casual – both his outfit and his demeanour. It turned out his “college education” was a few months of online courses at a community college that had since closed down. He studied international hospitality but gave up when the family business needed his help. He now runs an industrial carpet cleaning firm. Pet odour removal is their specialty.
She’d been wondering if Jeff had noticed that her blazer was not freshly pressed. She’d convinced herself it wasn’t visible. Just to be on the safe side, though, she removed it after the appetiser. This manoeuvre put her full breasts on clear display, barely concealed by the cream-coloured dress she had chosen for the occasion.
Twenty-nine years old, chief researcher at a major pharmaceutical company, she was wondering what had gone wrong. Why did she have to drag herself to dates with strangers instead of curling up on the sofa in her cosy living room – book in one hand and a cabernet sauvignon in the other? Perhaps her father had been right. “You might as well move into a monastery. Just as likely you’ll meet someone there as locked up in your place.”
Jeff ventured into talking about politics just as the main course arrived. He sounded like he had rehearsed what he was saying, but his views were moderate, and for the most part, she found his points reasonable. Then his phone rang. He fished it out of his pocket, looked at the screen, and excused himself. She kept staring in front of her while he was gone, without touching the salmon on her plate.
When he returned, he sat, ran his fingers through his hair, and fidgeted with his shiny, oversized wristwatch.
Then he said, “Have I told you your nails are done beautifully?”

It was my husband’s 45th birthday in November 1989, and we went out to lunch.
I never went out to lunch. András and I never went out to lunch. There simply was no time in his life or in mine for such luxuries, but we did have reasons to celebrate — and plans to make.
The Berlin Wall had been crumbling for months before it came down that November. András had been watching the news with uncommon interest, both professionally, as a political scientist, and personally, as a boy who became a refugee when he and his family fled Soviet tanks during the 1956 Uprising.
His life was now full of teaching at Concordia University and consulting work; mine was filled with teaching at John Abbott College, publishing Matrix magazine, and editing fiction mss. for Véhicule Press. Both our lives were brimming over with our marriage, our three sons, our big house, a yellow Labrador named Hector, and our writing and research; I’d just finished writing my book on Hugh MacLennan’s Two Solitudes.
András was going to be on sabbatical from May 1990, and I’d had good news about a research grant that would release me from teaching for the next three years. We were going to leave this busy life behind, pack up our children and Hector, a few books and other belongings, and spend the year in Budapest.
That was the plan. And that was the start of the Budapest of my imagination.
It did work out, in most ways, but there were unpleasant surprises, along the way. The nastiest was learning that the man who rented our house was a crook. The loveliest was the fairytale hillside villa we moved into in Budapest in June, 1990. The fact that we ended up living there for two years rather than one was hardly any surprise at all.
The most miraculous surprise, for me, was that I was able to write a novel in Hungary.
We returned to Montreal in the summer of 1992, and Birds of Passage was published by Signature Editions in 1993. It’s been out of print for years and now, in a process of rediscovery, I’ve begun to serialize it here and here.
My own rediscovery of that early book, certainly, as I hadn’t reread it for decades.
A rediscovery of the Budapest of that pivotal time, when the first post-communist government elected in Hungary in June 1990 stumbled into something close to anarchy.
And a rediscovery of the hope that fledgling government represented — a hope already being dashed in our first months in Hungary, and a hope that looks poignantly, tragically over-optimistic when viewed in the dark light of today’s Hungary and today’s world.
I’ve never been an expert on Hungary.
I was a foreigner there with a limited understanding of the language. I had been there several times before, though, starting in 1972, and had always been one of only a few foreigners there. I was in the privileged position of having close contact with András, who is an expert, and with many other Hungarians through his extended family and close friends who had been dissidents under the old regime.
And I had daily contact, in my halting Hungarian and my almost-forgotten German, seldom in French and English, with neighbours, my sons’ friends, shopkeepers, my language teachers, and a widening circle of Hungarian writers and artists.
At that November lunch in Montreal, I dreamed I might have time to write while we were in Budapest. And I did start writing almost immediately after we settled in, keeping a journal, taking notes, working on what I thought might be an essay.
Only then, sometime in October 1990, history caught my imagination, and I found myself writing dialogue, structuring a story, and creating characters. I kept going all the next year, telling no one what I was doing, hardly daring to hope this would become a novel.
I was doing my research work, too, and I was editing manuscripts and working remotely with Matrix co-editor Kenneth Radu, designer Susan Valyi, and business manager Diane Hibbard on upcoming issues of the magazine — and, as the months went on, putting together a special issue of stories, poems and images by the writers, translators and artists I was meeting in Hungary. The title of that issue is “The Budapest of the Imagination.”
The rediscovery of Birds of Passage is the rediscovery, for me, of a city I loved and once knew quite well, for a foreigner.
It’s the rediscovery, too, of the person I was then — I was 40 years old in 1990 – and the warily hopeful and bedazzled eyes through which I saw that city at a time when it was impossible to guess what the future had in store for its world-weary denizens, its avian populations, myself, or my family.
Like this new Hungary, my literary career was just a fledgling in 1990. Blue Metropolis was nowhere on the horizon. I had no way of knowing I would one day be a publisher of other writers’ books. And the reason I never told anyone I was writing a novel is that I was afraid it would never get published.
I present it now for readers interested in a great city living through a period of turmoil; for anyone curious about the process of becoming a writer; for those few who will notice how literary mores have evolved in the intervening decades; for everyone mesmerized, as I am, by the power of the imagination; and for amateur ornithologists everywhere.

One of the beauties of this platform is that it allows me to publish chapters of a novel that’s long been out of print and, in the process reread it and reconsider it.
There are practical considerations. I have neither a Word version of the novel now, nor even a pdf, so I’ve been scanning the printed book, chapter by chapter. I then copy and paste each chapter into a Word document. This results in countless glitches I then edit —for “to” has repeatedly become “ot,” to take just that example, and entire paragraphs moved to another page. So, I’m looking for glitches as I reread, trying to catch them all, and making a (very) few other changes necessitated by the passage of time.
I haven’t read the novel as a whole since it was published in 1993, but I’ve now posted 7 of the novel’s 18 chapters online. And it’s a discovery — and not only because I’d forgotten so much of what I wrote in Hungary.
The woman I was 30 years ago is in many ways a stranger to me, for a start. And, as chapter follows chapter, I’m learning things I never knew about writing, about becoming a writer, about putting myself in other people’s shoes, pink or otherwise, and about the connections between writing and pivotal moments in a history, a story, a life.
I’ve been taking notes, this spring, for a new book, when I have half an hour to do so. I’m usually too busy, as I was in 1990, to sit down and just write.
In those days I was in the throes — of wrapping up a semester of teaching, research, editing a new issue of Matrix magazine, preparing another fiction manuscript for publication by Véhicule Press, walking Hector, preparing meals, taking my sons to music class, swimming, pottery.
And today, I’m on a family holiday in a world at war, playing with my grandson Remy, running a publishing business online, planning a boat ride on the Thames, pondering the meaning of family — and writing at 5 a.m. instead of sleeping.
Writing, in my experience, has always been what gets done when I should be doing something else. So, one surprise about Birds of Passage is that it ever got written.
I had forgotten much about Gábor, and almost everything about Eszter, Tivadar, Rudi, even Alice. I do remember focussing a lot of attention on Alice, in particular, for I didn’t want anyone to mistake her for me. In those days the inclusion of autobiographical traits was a favourite cavil in reviews of first novels written by women.
So I’d forgotten how unlike me Alice is, and how comical she can be. I’m both amused and bemused by her curious dress sense, her hair, her nose, her obsessive running, her jumpiness, her outspokenness — and her early career as a photographer with the Royal Ulster Constabulary, of all places.
1990 was a time of change. Every time is a time of change, personally and politically, it’s always both. Like right now, for example.
If I knew that Birds of Passage was a novel about change, though, I had forgotten the extent to which Northern Ireland — and Quebec — figure in the novel, which I remembered as being focused single-mindedly on Budapest.
That city has remained vivid in my memory, but the vividness is unspecific, so I’ve felt jolts of recognition when details in the novel remind me of so much I had forgotten — including the nesting Russian dolls with images of successive Soviet leaders that were on sale in those days on the streets of Budapest.
If I knew that Birds of Passage was a novel about change — everything I write being about change — I had forgotten the extent to which it’s also a novel about home. And about being homeless.
About nationalism, different nationalisms — the nationalisms of Hungary, of Ireland, of Canada and Quebec — that are not so very different from one another, at least to an outsider. And not that different from the nationalisms that are tearing the world apart right now.
The novel is about family, too, a subject that now interests me greatly, surrounded by three generations of my own family, travelling with them, attending a family wedding.It’s about love, about those who are close to you.About foreigners, too, and the foreigners who are close to you.About movement and migration, refugees, exiles, displaced persons, and expatriates, which include those closest to you.About what matters, and how what matters coalesces at key moments in a history, or a life.
I already knew, 30 years ago, that those moments were key, even if I had no way of knowing what would follow, what new vistas they might open up.
I now know what the next three decades had in store for me personally, and I know a lot more about how the future would unfold for Hungary and Ireland, too, not to mention Quebec.
And I now know my first novel did in fact get published; that’s what I hoped for, of course, when I lived in Budapest, hoping against hope. And that, too, has become part of my story. Which means my first novel does end up being in some way autobiographical, in spite of all.
I know much less Hungarian today than I did back then, and I know much less today about the marvellous, complicated city I loved and then left in 1992; that loss is part of the story, too.
And part of my own story. As is revisiting the novel on this platform today.
So, in some ways I don’t understand, Birds of Passage looks forward to a future it could not know, almost as though poised upon a peak in Darien.

Where to go when visiting Budapest?
Sure, you may want to get a little lazy and relax in Szecheny Thermal Baths, or climb the Gellért Hill to have a glance over the nightly Budapest, having a beer (or the famous Hungarian white dessert Tokaji aszú wine) sitting just by the feet of the Liberty Statue, there is a booming music scene n Budapest. And guess what, definitely worth checking out!
Aurora — Toldi — Golya — Ambient — Beat on the Brat — Keret — Durer Kert — Tinta Art Cafe — Larm — Kék ló —
Yes, there are many. And this is not a closed list.
But, for one who loves going for the specific music, here is the list.
If you are into electronic music, Aurora, Ambient and Larm would be the best bets. With Larm going for a dance and more or less techno-club style, Ambient is a more laid-back bar with an audience slightly more inclined to enjoy the drinks, instead of dancing. Aurora is the most un-clubbish of all three, with community centre being at its core, fighting for social rights. Still, you can enjoy some pretty awesome music there on Friday and Saturday nights.
Toldi is another good choice to go for. In daytime a cafe and a (good) movie theatre, it turns into a nightclub when the sun goes down. Located just by the Basilica, it is a good choice for those willing to take a stroll around the city before going clubbing.
Aurora and Golya will take a lead on this, with Durer Kert and Kek Lo following. Both being places hosting a wide set of events, these event avenues are mostly bar-like, welcoming people enjoying all sorts of music styles.
If a true vintage sound is what you are going for, Beat on the Brat is the fool-proof shot. At times feeling ridiculously small, it is a spot for the vintage-obsessed folk to get together at. You can hear everything, from swing to 80s rock, and meet one-of-a-kind people here. Located in the very centre, it is a great place to check out on your way to Larm or other mainstream clubs.
Summer is about to open the doors and bringing down roofs to allow music out. Durer Kert, A38 and Valyo Kikoto are all about open air music. On top of this, make sure not to miss the month of Budapest`s green bridge being locked for locals to enjoy weekend nights on! This is another post though. Stay tuned and meanwhile check the best deals from CuddlyNest!

We started our European River Cruise on a Viking Longship in Budapest! What a great place to begin our trip than surrounded by magnificent buildings and iconic bridges.
Our boat was docked by the Liberty Bridge. This bridge was started in 1894 and finished in 1896 in time for the Millennium World Exhibition. It is the shortest of Budapest’s three bridges (source).
It was built in the art nouveau style and originally named the Francis Joseph Bridge after the emperor who ruled Hungary at the time (source).
We got a good look at the Liberty Bridge on our second day in Budapest when we finished wandering the city’s Market Hall. From the market, we walked straight towards the river and found the Pest entrance of the bridge before us.
“Both portals are decorated with the coat of arms of Hungary designed by Virgil Nagy and two Turul statues each. Turuls are falcon-like birds, prominent in ancient Hungarian mythology.” —…

Much has changed in the literary firmament in the decades since I wrote Birds of Passage in 1990, and one of the most significant changes is our awareness as readers today of issues of cultural appropriation and the appropriation of voice.
Do I have the right to put myself in Gábor’s position? In that of other Hungarian characters, like Tivadar, István, Rudi, Kalliope and Magda?
Or in those Daniel, Pierrette, even Peter?
Is it only Indigenous stories that are out of bounds to me, as a writer with no Indigenous ancestry?
Are the stories of Black people are out of bounds to me, too? That of Alice’s husband Daniel, who is from Goa? How about that of Peter, Alice and Daniel’s mixed-race son?
And what other stories should I not be telling, as a white Canadian woman born in Belfast?
Those of male characters? Or not?
Those of Hungarians, given that I am not Hungarian?
What are the rules, exactly?And do they apply to any story that isn’t my very own?
No one seems too sure about all this, though it’s sometimes argued that these issues arise only (or mostly?) if, say, a white writer profits from their use of the stories of marginalized people.
The American poet Paisley Rekdal has explored this subject in her book Appropriate (Norton, 2021) and her Lithub piece, “Struggling in Workshop with the Question of Cultural Appropriation” (16 Feb 2021).
“Cultural appropriation,” Rekdal writes, “is less a question of ‘staying in one’s lane,’ …than an evolving conversation we must have around privilege and aesthetic fashion in literary practice.”
The English novelist Margaret Drabble argued in 2004 that “appropriation is what novelists do. Whatever we write is, knowingly or unknowingly, a borrowing. Nothing comes from nowhere.”
Having created Guyanese and Jewish characters for her novel The Witch of Exmore and an 18th- century Korean royal protagonist for The Red Queen, Drabble later revised her view in a Publishers Weekly interview, saying, “You can’t just barge in there and assume you have got the right to tell other people’s stories. You have to react sensitively to other people.”
Can that be it?
Is it a question of sensitivity? A question of quality? Is avoiding stereotypes key?
Avoiding stereotypes is always key, surely, but the question remains:
Did I have the right to write Birds of Passage?
It’s true that issues of appropriation were not in the forefront of public attention when I was writing the novel in the early 1990s, also that race is not particularly significant in its pages.
Next question:
Do I have the right to republish Birds of Passage today?
Yes?
No?
What is my “lane”?Am I allowed to write only about myself — out of my own personal experiences?
(As some of you are aware, I have done this several times, and it’s a practice that has sometimes landed me in hot water.)(And I seem to be writing about my own personal experience again, right now. Or, am I mistaken about that?)
Let me do my best to move on, through this thicket, for I do have another question:
What role, if any, is played in this by profit?

The Grand Budapest Hotel boasts a stellar cast, including Ralph Fiennes, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Willem Dafoe, Tilda Swinton, Adrien Brody, Jude Law, and Jeff Goldblum, among many others. However, the true star of the film is the hotel itself. Set in the fictional Eastern European state of Zubrowka (inspired by the spa city of Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic, and named after a Polish bison grass vodka), the film tells a short history of Eastern Europe in the 20th century through the lens of this once-grand establishment.
We witness the hotel in its gilded 1930s heyday, bask in its opulent glow, and then watch as the ravages of time and the Soviet era gradually erode its grandeur. Finally, we find it transformed into a faded relic, the inspiration for a cherished book in the present day. This ambitious narrative demanded a remarkable feat of production design. To capture the passage of time within the same in-film space, the filmmakers ingeniously constructed multiple sets, each intricately layered within the others, like a cinematic Russian nesting doll.
Production designer Adam Stockhausen, a frequent collaborator of director Wes Anderson who also worked on The Darjeeling Limited (2007), Moonrise Kingdom (2012), Isle of Dogs (2018), and The French Dispatch (2021), describes the filmmaking process of The Grand Budapest Hotel as akin to solving a complex puzzle. He candidly admits that The Grand Budapest Hotel presented one of the most formidable challenges of his illustrious career, a sentiment echoed by his experience crafting the intricate stage design for Charlie Kaufman’s film-within-a-film Synecdoche, New York (2008).
BackgroundBefore traveling to Europe for location scouting, Wes Anderson and Adam Stockhausen conducted extensive research, studying archival photographs of numerous hotels across various locations, including London, Scotland, and Switzerland. This research provided a foundation for their exploration, allowing them to identify potential sites that aligned with their vision for the film.
During their European travels, Anderson and Stockhausen drew significant inspiration from the historical narratives embedded within the real-world locations they encountered. A poignant example was a local civic centre, once a testament to architectural grandeur, now left to decay. Stockhausen vividly recalls the hammer marks that marred the intricate carvings, a stark reminder of the passage of time and the erosion of beauty.
The town of Karlovy Vary in Czech Republic, with its picturesque pastel-coloured buildings lining the riverfront and its collection of elegant hotels perched on overlooking hills, perfectly captured the desired aesthetic and mood for the film. Its unique atmosphere ultimately inspired the choice of this location as the primary outdoor shooting site.
Bristol Palace HotelWhile Grandhotel Pupp is often cited as the primary aesthetic inspiration for Wes Anderson’s fictional Grand Budapest Hotel, the Bristol Palace Hotel in Karlovy Vary bears a more striking resemblance to the film’s iconic structure. Its distinctive pink facade, adorned with mansard roof, dormer windows, flanking turrets, and a stag atop its peak, was remarkably replicated in the film, creating a visually striking homage that almost appears like a hyper-realistic, larger-than-life version of the Bristol Palace.
The Bristol Palace Hotel is an integral part of the Bristol Group complex, a collection of seven buildings developed by two prominent Karlovy Vary families: the esteemed physician Dr. Willem Fasolt and the renowned hotelier family, the Tellers. Between 1872 and 1908, they constructed several properties in the tranquil “Westend” district of the city, including the Bristol Villa (now the Bristol Palace Hotel), Königsvila (Královská Villa), Teresa (Tereza), and Fasolt (now Livia), all intended to provide a haven for hospitality and relaxation.
Designed by Viennese architects Hans Schidl and Alfred Bayer in the spirit of Viennese historicism, the Bristol Palace Hotel showcases a captivating blend of architectural styles inspired by castle architecture. Recognised as one of the most valuable and visually appealing buildings in the Czech Republic, the iconic Bristol Palace Hotel should not be confused with the larger Hotel Bristol, the main building within the Bristol Group complex. The latter was constructed on the site of a former Jewish synagogue, tragically destroyed during the Nazi-orchestrated Kristallnacht in 1938.
Grandhotel PuppWhile Adam Stockhausen often cited Grandhotel Pupp as a major inspiration for The Grand Budapest Hotel, many believe the film draws more inspiration from the hotel’s dramatic location — perched on a hill, surrounded by forest, and overlooking the town of Karlovy Vary — and its overall sense of grandeur.
The 228-room Grandhotel Pupp significantly surpasses the Bristol Palace Hotel in size and age. Its history dates back to 1907 with the construction of the Saxony Hall by Anton Deiml, then Mayor of Karlovy Vary. Subsequently, Mayor Becher built the Bohemian Hall on adjacent land, creating direct competition. The Pupp family acquired the Saxony Hall in 1776 and later the Bohemian Hall in 1890. Between 1896 and 1907, renowned Viennese architects Fellner & Helmer transformed these family-owned buildings into the neo-Baroque Grandhotel Pupp that stands today. This rich and intricate history is meticulously detailed on the hotel’s official website.
Grandhotel Pupp boasts a distinguished guest list, having welcomed a diverse array of luminaries throughout its history. From the intellectual giants like Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud and Czech writer Franz Kafka to renowned composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Richard Wagner, and even historical figures like Russian astronaut Yuri Gagarin and statesmen Napoleon Bonaparte and Otto von Bismarck, the hotel has played host to a veritable who’s who of history.
Grandhotel Pupp made a cinematic appearance in the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale, where it served as the fictional Hotel Splendide, set in Montenegro.
Görlitz WarenhausWes Anderson sought a realistic location for filming the Grand Budapest Hotel’s interiors and discovered the vacant Görlitz department store, an abandoned building that allowed complete artistic control and time flexibility. This twentieth-century Görlitz Warenhaus, with its impressive atrium, became the centrepiece of the production. The atrium itself was transformed into the hotel lobby, while the open galleries of the surrounding floors were adapted into hotel corridors, complete with meticulously placed hotel rooms.
To furnish these spaces, the production team meticulously sourced furniture and decor from various eras, ensuring authenticity within the film’s timeline. The top two floors of the department store were repurposed to house production offices and storage for cameras and wardrobe. During the ten-week shoot in early 2013, the entire film crew, including actors Tilda Swinton, Willem Dafoe, and Ralph Fiennes, resided at the neighbouring Hotel Börse.
The site of the Görlitz Warenhaus has a rich history. In 1717, it housed the “Goldener Strauß” (Golden Ostrich) inn, which later expanded into a hotel. Inspired by the renowned Wertheim department store on Leipziger Platz in Berlin, the Görlitz city council envisioned a similar establishment at this location. Potsdam architect Carl Schmanns designed the “department store at the ostrich,” and construction commenced in 1912 after the demolition of the existing hotel. Built with a steel skeleton and adorned with an Art Nouveau facade, the department store opened to the public on 30 September 1913.
The Görlitz Warenhaus experienced multiple changes in ownership, and at one point, Anderson even considered purchasing the building to prevent its demolition. In June 2013, investor Winfried Stöcker acquired the property with plans to revive it as a department store. However, the reopening faced numerous delays, initially planned for 2016 and then for the fall of 2017, due to the realisation that extensive restoration and renovation were necessary.
In November 2020, the project encountered a significant setback when a dispute arose concerning the demolition of two neighboring buildings. Stöcker sought to demolish these structures to improve delivery access to the store and a nearby parking garage. However, the local landmark preservation office mandated their preservation. This impasse led to Stöcker threatening to abandon the entire project if demolition was not permitted.
The smallest detailsOccasionally, the scope of a film’s vision surpasses the limitations of physical sets. In such instances, the filmmakers must employ creative solutions. For The Grand Budapest Hotel, this involved a skillful blend of practical and digital techniques, utilizing matte paintings and miniature effects to convincingly create the illusion of grandeur and scale. Wes Anderson, while primarily favouring practical filmmaking, recognises the value of post-production techniques like visual effects, colour timing, and other digital enhancements, when necessary.
This approach is evident from the very beginning of the film. The introduction scene to the hotel involves a sweeping horizontal movement across the landscape. It culminates in a dramatic reveal of the hotel perched majestically atop a hill, with a funicular ascending towards it. This specific image was intentionally created using miniatures, as no such location exists in reality. This technique harkens back to the classic Hollywood tradition of utilising models to achieve desired cinematic effects.
Under the guidance of Simon Weisse, a team of skilled prop makers at Studio Babelsberg in Berlin meticulously constructed scale models of the structures, working in tandem with the production team at the Görlitz Warenhaus. The Grand Budapest Hotel set, featuring the hotel building atop a wooded ledge complete with a funicular, was meticulously crafted. This was further enhanced by a Friedrichian landscape painting seamlessly integrated with green-screen technology. The 3-meter-high hotel model was meticulously sculpted using silicone resin molds and adorned with intricate brass embellishments. To create the illusion of light, photographs of the Görlitz Warenhaus set were strategically placed within the model’s windows.
To achieve the aged, brutalist aesthetic of the Soviet-era Grand Budapest Hotel, the visual effects team employed a combination of computer-generated models, intricate lighting, matte effects, and carefully orchestrated shadows. A similar technique was utilised to create the observatory, where the base miniature was constructed in separate pieces. The observatory was rendered with 20 distinct elements, with the final digital rendering refined further at Anderson’s request, requiring approximately one hour per shot.
Costume designer Milena Canonero meticulously captured the essence of each character through their wardrobe. While the hotel uniforms adhered to the stylistic conventions of the 1930s, the color palette was intentionally unconventional. The majority of the costumes were crafted within the Görlitz Warenhaus workshop, with additional pieces sourced from Berlin-based Theaterkunst and the uniforms produced by a Polish workshop. The filmmakers drew inspiration from renowned artists such as photographers Man Ray and George Hurrell, and painters Gustav Klimt, Kees van Dongen, Tamara de Lempicka, and George Grosz.
Just as Wes Anderson enlisted Marc Jacobs, then creative director of Louis Vuitton, to design period-inspired suitcases for The Darjeeling Limited, he commissioned Miuccia Prada to create a 21-piece set of luggage for Madame D. (Tilda Swinton) and Concierge Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) in The Grand Budapest Hotel. Drawing inspiration from the 1920s and 1930s, when Prada primarily focused on leather goods, the luggage showcases exquisite turn-of-the-century finishes and the iconic Grana Paglia pattern. While not a central plot point, these meticulously crafted pieces leave a lasting impression on the viewer.
Graphic designWes Anderson enlisted graphic designer Annie Atkins to bring the fictional world of The Grand Budapest Hotel to life. Previously an art director at McCann Erickson in Reykjavik, Iceland, Atkins was relatively new to film design. She meticulously designed nearly every on-screen artefact bearing text — ubrowka money, police reports, passports, telegrams, pastry packaging, perfume lettering, and even a prison map.
To achieve this, Atkins drew inspiration from reference materials meticulously collected by herself, Anderson, and production designer Adam Stockhausen during extensive location scouting. Her dedication was evident in her meticulous process, often sketching 20 variations of a single artefact by hand daily. This painstaking effort paid off, allowing her to keep cherished mementos like the iconic The Grand Budapest Hotel book, a Mendl’s box, and a bloodstained telegram from Serge the butler.
Atkins’s attention to detail extended beyond the screen. She adapted the hotel’s entrance sign from a 1930s metal sign Anderson discovered in Cairo, creating a hand-drawn version with somewhat uneven, jaunty serifs. Even objects unseen on screen, like Ralph Fiennes’ character Gustave H’s notebook, received meticulous consideration. Fiennes preferred lined pages, though, reflecting the character’s personality, a detail that Wes loves.
The fictional newspapers in The Grand Budapest Hotel — The Trans Alpine Yodel, The Daily Fact, and The Continental Drift — showcase Anderson’s meticulousness. He wrote every story, regardless of on-screen appearance or relevance to the main plot, and Atkins designed each newspaper accordingly. Authenticity was paramount. Atkins even studied Hitler’s calling card to design a business card for a fascist character in the film.
For those seeking to replicate the “aged” look of props, Atkins offers a practical tip: use three Barry’s tea bags to age paper by ten years. Even if props are new within the film’s narrative, the audience expects an “old” aesthetic for a period piece.
DigitalTo further immerse audiences in the world of The Grand Budapest Hotel, a fictional website called the Akademie Zubrowka was created. This online platform, reminiscent of the 1960s, offered a series of stylised lessons on the history of the fictional Republic of Zubrowka.
Designed to seamlessly blend the aesthetics of the late 1960s with the 1930s setting of the film, the Akademie Zubrowka website mimicked a microfiche machine, complete with a navigational wheel to guide viewers through the digital “slides.” Photographs were meticulously recreated to resemble hand-coloured black-and-white prints, further enhancing the nostalgic ambiance.
Watson Digital, working closely with Fox Searchlight and director Wes Anderson himself, produced the entire site in-house. This collaborative effort allowed Anderson to fully explore and develop the stylised fictional world he envisioned, including an unusual amount of written content. While this presented a design challenge, the team embraced the opportunity to work directly with the director to bring his vision to life.
The Akademie Zubrowka was met with enthusiastic reception from fans of Anderson’s work. It provided a unique opportunity to delve deeper into the film’s world and was featured in publications such as Variety and MovieWeb.
Unfortunately, the Akademie of Zubrowka website was discontinued around 2018. However, interested viewers can still explore it through the Wayback Machine. Alternatively, if you ever had the pleasure of staying at the fictional Grand Budapest Hotel, you might consider sharing your experiences by writing a review on its (fictional) TripAdvisor page here.
The Grand Budapest Hotel was basically a critical darling, showing up on tons of critics’ “best of” lists. Everyone raved about how incredibly well-crafted it was, especially its zany vibe and that signature Wes Anderson touch. On Rotten Tomatoes, a whopping 92% of 319 critics gave it the thumbs up, while Metacritic gave it a fancy score of 88 out of 100 based on 48 reviews. The film’s Akademie Zubrowka also won numerous awards including one Webby in 2015.
At the 87th Academy Awards, the film received nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Film Editing. It ultimately won awards for Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and Best Original Score, which you can hear below.

Illusions of Grandeur in THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL
“To be frank, I think his world has vanished long before he ever entered it. But I will say, he certainly sustained the illusion with a marvelous grace.” — Zero Mustafa, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL
The key to survival in Wes Anderson’s 2014 film “The Grand Budapest Hotel” is keeping up appearances. Though the film is presented in Anderson’s trademark pristine dollhouse-like style, the world within it can be as nasty and ruthless as our own. One look at a poster for the film with its pastel colored buildings and calligraphic lettering gives no indication that the film will that feature brutal prison shankings, a beheading, and an extended shootout occuring on several floors of the eponymous hotel.
But that’s the artistry at work in Wes Anderson’s masterpiece: what appears to be merely a light, madcap romp turns out also to be a rather melancholy tale of two social climbers learning that there are dangers in the ritzy world of the upper class no different from the ones they’ve escaped.
Our two leads Zero and Monsieur Gustave are outsiders dealing in matters far above their pay grade, and only survive by taking heed to the old adage “act like you’ve been here before”.
Zero, whom we meet as the unassuming Lobby Boy and loyal sidekick of Monsieur Gustave turns out to be a refugee of Anderson’s version of WWII and the eventual owner of the hotel. Behind his big, watchful eyes hides a painful past filled with memories of the family he lost in the war.
While Gustave’s past is never quite so defined, we know from his own words he also came from humble beginnings, even once having served as Lobby Boy himself. What’s most fascinating about Gustave is that the persona he displays throughout the movie is a whole cloth fabrication. He’s no more a member of high-society than Zero, though he’d never let you know and you’d never be able to tell. He’s absorbed his regal, professional disposition from the aristocrats and old-money figures who frequent the hotel.
When the pair escape the home of the DeGoff und Taxis family with “Boy with Apple” in tow, they do so by doing their best to blend in and not draw attention to themselves (despite their loud purple uniforms). It isn’t until Gustave announces his presence that anyone even notices the two were there to begin with. And this isn’t the only time they find a way to look the part. Much of the last act is filled with the two changing in and out of various disguises in order to keep themselves out of early graves.
On two occasions we see Zero and Gustave aboard a train whose path is blocked by soldiers. searching for refugees. On these occasions, Zero escapes the firing squads his family fell victim to on the strength of Gustave’s good name, — “he’s with me” Gustave assures the soldiers — while Gustave survives (at least once) due to his aristocratic manner and past kind deeds, but a kind, aristocrat is not exactly who he is. Outside of his duties as concierge, Gustave can be rather profane, bitter, vain, rude, insensitive, and even crass, but he knows when to turn on the charm. That charm gets him brief access to the finest things Anderson’s world has to offer. Until it doesn’t.
Ultimately, Gustave meets that early grave he’d been eluding. The costume he wears can’t get him through every door or out of every jam. Being a rich, vain, blonde doesn’t save his life in the end, and truth be told, it never did. The character of “Monsieur Gustave H. of the Grand Budapest Hotel” gave him entree into this fanciful world, but it doesn’t protect him within it. What saves Gustave is his willingness in his darkest moments to strip away all (most) pretense and meet Zero and others on their level. Not as the concierge of an esteemed hotel, but as a helpless man who had no one else to turn to. For it isn’t any of his rich lovers who break him out of prison. His escape is made with the help of some lowly inmates and his loyal lobby boy. It’s not until he hears Zero’s story and feels his pain that they truly connect and become as Zero puts it “brothers”.
What Gustave internalizes in the end is that what endears one most to others is the way you treat them. No one likes Gustave because he’s posh or learned, they like him because of his meticulous attention to detail, his loyalty, and being as Captain Henckels puts it “very kind”. That kindness and care is what wins over his man lady “friends”, it’s what wins over his cutthroat cellmates, and it’s what fully wins over his eventual heir, Zero.

Note: Most review fragments taken from the author’s Reddit review.
I must be the most pathetic movie aficionados to not get the chance to watch Wes Anderson movies. I’ve heard the words: picturesque, aesthetic, symmetrical. All-in-all satisfying. I’ve heard The Grand Budapest Hotel in years, yet it’s only in 2021 where I get to watch it, 7 years after its release.
Can I just open by saying how I love myself after this? Because finally, finally, anticipation is paid off. Nearly-decade long anticipation. It is rare for a movie to leave me so amused as if I have just littered by mouth with foams of fluffy clouds. It’s like marijuana, but visual, coming from Disney, and legal. At least, in some states — OK, I admit, I have a bad sense of humour.
Nobody shall deny that this is splendid. If you’re looking for a movie to relax and to improve your eyesight, this could be one. A vintage yet faithful depiction of a fascist regime framed by slapstick humour. Often movies can’t blend various elements, but The Grand Budapest Hotel does it right. The cinematography, visuals, and editing are to die for — I can’t stress this enough. The hype is not overhyped, it seems for the first time. There are some issues, though, with the brightness (it often feels too bright), and I don’t understand why a squared aspect ratio is preferred for the modern-day but widescreen is used for the late 60s and 80s.
But also, nobody can deny that there is a flaw in this movie. A huge, huge flaw. It is not delivered well.
The first minutes are nothing short of a masterpiece. Somehow I find the way Madame saying “I’m not leaving” funny, it sounds like a rom-com satire. The inciting incident is expressed naturally, so I have few complaints.
Amid it, the movie starts falling apart, apart from the camerawork, acting, and grandeur overture. Considering the prologue and first two parts takes a long time, I expect the remaining time to be much more, not specifically longer, but more elements. Right now the main plot is easily predictable: there’s gonna be a winter prison break, and a kiddie fight for Boy with Apple.
Right now, the cinematography is misleading. It is like a visual drug to keep you awake on a starting-to-get-boring movie. Kinda the same for the acting. Some of the throwaway plot points still remain enjoyable, but they don’t contribute to improving the plot. Because of the nature of the movie, everything feels trivial and I don’t connect with the characters anymore.
The ending is melancholic and satisfying. But a large part of “satisfying” is, “Finally! This movie is over I kinda… knew it.” I didn’t feel anything, other than the common chills I get every time I see a movie. I didn’t feel moved or questioning things or stuff like that. Except I did question one thing: “Why did they choose that font for the subtitles?”
The Grand Budapest Hotel is not a cursed premise nor an unnatural narrative. It explores controversial and strong themes, with great technical work. But Wes Anderson did not seem to dive deeper into the script, rather only anticipated in shooting it. The movie is a fine work. But it’s not great, and can do better. Nobody can deny, though, that Gustave’s legacy will carry on for long on the big screen.

Sitting in the Dark
Like most survivors of extreme trauma, my father Laszlo never talked about what he had endured during and after WWII. Such avoidance is understandable — why bring back pain so mercifully repressed with the help of time, distractions, and forgetfulness? Why relive reminders of suffering and death, when the guilt of survival is already too much to bear?
Laszlo never spoke much, anyway, facilitating his evasion while exacerbating my curiosity. Weekday nights he’d come home from work at 5pm, demanding dinner on the table. We ate with my mother in awkward silence, or cowering from his wrath. From there he sat in his big chair in front of the TV, reading the paper until 10pm. Off to bed, rinse and repeat.
One random night the power went out, no television and no light to read his newspaper. As we lit candles and sat in the flickering shadows, I asked him again about the war. The few times I tried were failures, Laszlo wondering why I would care, why would anyone care, since he and his family suffered to the indifference of their neighbors, and the world.
He made a good point, but that night I gave it another whirl, and — surprise surprise — he started to speak slowly in his native Hungarian, buried words arduously clawing to the surface. He had a deep, Bela Lugosi voice, and I felt as though The Grinch Who Stole Christmas were narrating The Bombing of Budapest. We journeyed to Hungary in 1944, only thirty years before…
That summer an average of ten thousand people were murdered per day in the camps. Meanwhile, sixteen-year-old Laszlo lived large at a refurbished Jewish Community Center taken over by the Gestapo and SD. He was part of the expendable local help that had been rounded up by the Germans soon after the Tiger tanks clanked through the cobbled Budapest streets.
Jewish talent was recruited by the Germans across various trades: tailors, seamstresses, carpenters, electricians. Laszlo was chosen by his high school principal as designated draftsman, price paid for being the most talented in shop class. The Nazis gave him his own secretary and office — he decorated it with mounted animal heads ripped from a taxidermist’s shop.
Laszlo was a tall, dashing, Errol Flynn-looking kid with a deeply cynical sense of humor, and the Übermensch thought he was cool. Laszlo thought the tall, dashing, blond-haired blue-eyed Aryans were cool, too, creating an odd Ashkenazi-Nazi dynamic. Entertaining them as class clown and mascot, they printed official documents making him an officer in the SD.
Laszlo felt invincible as most teens do, and had no idea what was soon in store, including a brush with Adolf Eichmann, being caught playing cards on the job, nearly beaten to death and thrown into solitary confinement, released with no shoes into the wintry Siege of Budapest, hidden in a neighbor’s cellar, and nearly deported to Siberia by the Russians.
At some point between sharing air with Eichmann and being tortured, Laszlo sat in his office one summer evening, drawing Wehrmacht uniform insignia and various armaments. The air raid siren went off, staffers panicked. Above them the B-24 Liberators from the Fifteenth Expeditionary Air Force were in formation, attacking the city.
The heavy aircraft dropped mines into the Danube River, and bombs onto Hungarian factories, refineries, and oil tanks. They also released leaflets throughout Budapest that boldly threatened the enemy with retribution for deporting thousands of Jews to the gas chambers in Auschwitz. The world was watching, they said — too bad the Allies didn’t actually try to stop it.
Seeing the Light
“We must go downstairs to the shelter!” the secretary shrieked, rushing into his office. Weighing whether to follow her and use the fog of war to try and get some nookie, or see what was going on, he opted for the latter. “A direct hit kills us all, anyway,” he said. “So I’m going up to the roof. Want to join me?” Despite his resemblance to Errol Flynn, she fled into the bunker.
He went up, not down, made himself comfortable on the rooftop, and watched the show. Search lights darted across the sky, as anti-aircraft flak burst around the illuminated bomber formations and escorting fighter squadrons. Laszlo watched streams of incendiaries pour out of the big planes, saw the distant explosions as factories and depots erupted.
An unlucky Liberator took a direct hit, left wing breaking off as the bomber dipped and plummeted. Spiraling downward, several parachutes became visible, bobbing dreamily as they floated serenely over the roiling city. Laszlo wondered what being an allied serviceman flying in those planes and now shot down must be like, descending into a strange city at war.
As a kid, Laszlo loved watching American movies, and like most Europeans romanticized the States based on Hollywood films. His emulation of Errol Flynn was no accident, the actor smoothly embodying the epitome of a swashbuckling lady’s man. Laszlo loved him in The Adventures of Robin Hood. Bored in class, he dreamt of some day becoming a Yankee Doodle.
As a teen, Laszlo watched the real life show of swiveling beams reflect off the flak bursts and vapor trails, as the surviving heavy bombers released their loads and flew back to safety, the anti-aircraft fire dying down and search lights thinning. Still alive, he trundled back downstairs and returned to his office. “You are crazy!” his secretary said, duly impressed.
Everything went back to “normal” until about an hour later, when Laszlo heard commotion and loud, guttural German voices outside his office. He went to his door, opened it, and saw his Nazi buddies standing nearby chatting, pointing, and calling out. One of the parachuting bombardiers had been caught, and was now put on display for his merciless captors.
Three decades later in flickering candle light, Laszlo shared his wonder at making direct eye contact with his first American: A young man only a few years older, red haired and freckled, wearing a US airman’s uniform and boots. Beaten, his face was covered in gashes and welts — too weak to walk, he was dragged down the hallway, his crimson blood trailing behind.
Laszlo knew nothing about the Geneva Conventions, and neither did the Gestapo, who tortured Laszlo’s First American to death a few doors down the hall. As I watched my father speak, I imagined young Laszlo at his desk beneath the mounted animal heads, trying to concentrate as the young US flyer cried out. American dream turned to nightmare, an ominous sign?
Only a few months earlier, Laszlo was hanging out with his friends, complaining about his parents, ignoring his younger brother, trying to get laid, and wondering about his future when the most brutal war in human history literally came knocking at his door. Of the hundred or so students in his high school class, only sixteen survived. He was one of them.
The price usually paid for survival is guilt: “Why was I spared, and not the others?” Another cost is the jealousy, defeatism, and victimization that guilt-ridden survivors hurl at their own families. A few decades after that fateful evening, Laszlo stared into the face of another American — his first and only son. I likely filled him with equal curiosity, wonder, and terror.

Apart from one firecracker set off one day early, a neighbor having a short but noisy party in the late evening, and a couple waking me up with their rather loud orgasms the morning after, there was no real sign of celebration.
I traveled to Budapest on the 27th of December, thinking that New Year’s Eve (NYE) may be like Christmas in Budapest; everything including the busses shuts down around 3 PM, and if you’re unlucky enough not to have booked a taxi then you aren’t likely to go anywhere unless you are walking. And many people do. From morning until late afternoon, you will see people out for ‘walks’, but they are actually on their way to where they are celebrating Christmas Eve. They’ll be dressed in moderately nice clothes and carrying wine bottles or other enjoyable Christmas things. However, NYE is not all like like Christmas Eve in this bohemian city — people just don’t care that much — and this surprised me enough to jump into an air balloon — literally.
You see, when I realized that I had again made a booboo — last year I knew nothing about busses shutting down and ended up needing to get picked up by family members — and that I should have booked myself onto a NYE boat trip or some form of party for tourists, I was rather upset. Not even my cousin…

It wasn’t a long time ago when I asked Stefan about his work, but here comes a new interview, since he has just finished another drawing on Budapest. Let’s find out what has happened to him since last September.
What has happened to you since we spoke last year?All of a sudden, things went really fast after our first interview. Apart from two successful exhibitions in Holland, the media took note of my work last December, which led to newspaper publications in the UK, Belgium, Holland and Italy and a score of Internet publications. Later on, in January, I was invited to appear on the Belgian national television in a talk show named Bart and Siska. Currently, I’m preparing work for a number of future exhibitions in Holland and Switzerland later this year.
If you speak Dutch here is the video for you to watch:http://www.een.be/programmas/bart-siska/tekentalent-stefan-bleekrode
You have just finished another drawing on Budapest. Could you tell us about the process? The initial large-scale drawing was merely based on Budapest; I used the architecture and many landmarks to create a “new” city based on Budapest. I wasn’t entirely satisfied with that work because of the faulty perspective and somewhat monotonous background. Immediately, I felt I needed to do another piece sometime. It took me almost two years to meditate on this new piece that had to include not just most of the famous sights but also offers a view more captivating than the previous drawing.
The perspective plays a major role in all of Stefan’s works. He is well known for drawing from a bird’s eye perspective so I was eager to hear about how the process went this time. Furthermore, Budapest also belongs to that group of cities that offer a lot of possibilities for artists to capture it on their artworks. Last time Stefan was flying from the Liberty Bridge towards the Margaret Island, but now he has begun his trip in District 13.
How did you decide on the perspective of the drawing this time?This perspective was in my mind already for quite a long time but it took me a while to get things sorted out, and not until my previous visit to Budapest, last year in May, I felt confident enough to tackle what was really quite a difficult subject. When I walked around the city I noticed there were many geometric forms, for instance the street layout and the rooftop angles. This perspective is broken by straight and diagonal boulevards, and the river running across the city. Getting the perspective right was essential.
Before I did any ink drawing I made extensive pencil sketches to get the composition right. So I made the Saint Stephen’s Boulevard shorter than in reality and left some of the area South of it out of the drawing. To make the drawing a bit less monotonous, an endless sea of roofs, I made Elisabeth Square and Déak Square bigger, kind of turned it into a park. Still, even as I went along I kept making changes: I made the river wider, and later on I decided to raise the horizon a bit and obscure it with a watercolour wash.
Stefan’s success cannot be only seen in the media but he actually makes a living as an artist, which does not necessarily happen to everyone who dedicates her/his life to art. Stefan is an exception as he has sold several of his artworks and probably will sell many more. Let’s find out where one should look for the new drawing(s)!
What happens to it now?The drawing got sold immediately upon completion to a Dutch family who used to live in Budapest for three years. I suppose it will be framed now before the buyers collect it from the gallery.
Are you planning to draw more pieces on Budapest?Yes, there’s already a small drawing under construction of a busy intersection with trams and buses, similar to Astoria. Maybe one day I’ll do a view of Buda Castle and the old district next to it. Other than that, I was thinking of doing perhaps a city like Pécs, I haven’t been there yet but it is apparently very beautiful.
Unfortunately, we still have to wait for an exhibition taking place in Hungary, but if you happen to be in the Netherlands or Switzerland, take the opportunity and visit one of the galleries showcasing Stefan’s pieces. Stefan is naming the destination in his last answer.
If someone is interested in seeing your works in person where s/he should go?My work is currently on sale and display at the Frank Welkenhuysen Gallery in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Besides this, I’ll have a show with oil colours at Galerie Müller in Luzern this summer and more drawings will go on display at Keine Kunst in Bern this fall. But it would be great to show some of my Hungary-inspired pieces in Budapest or elsewhere!

I will never forget the first time I saw the Danube. It was my first time in Budapest, and, as I walked toward the impressive world-famous Hungarian Parliament Building, I saw the beautiful city lights reflected on the river’s peaceful waters under the pink and purple sunset. I was speechless.
Hungary is most known for its fascinating capital, Budapest, recently considered the second best city to visit in Eastern Europe in U.S. News ranking and included in Time’s World’s Greatest Places in 2023. However, this country has much more to offer to international visitors and tourism has significantly recovered in the past few years.
Data Confirms Travelers Want To Explore Hungary And Love Budapest
More than 6 million international travelers explored the country this summer 2023. According to Statista, most foreign visitors are from neighboring countries: Slovakia, Romania, and Austria.
However, especially in Budapest, you can encounter travelers from all over the world. This is a relief as it’s easier to communicate in English and it is the most common language used in tourist places and among visitors. I tried to learn a few words in Hungarian but couldn’t get past “thank you” — Köszönöm — , and I quickly understood why Hungarian is considered one of the most difficult languages in the world. Luckily, this is not a barrier to visiting, but tour guides do help provide a much more enriching experience.
The Hungarian government said that tourism exceeded their expectations in 2022 and that this year the records will show higher rates compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019. And it’s easy to see why this destination attracts more travelers.
Hungary Is A Perfect Destination For Pleasure And Relaxation
There are over 1,300 thermal water springs — Budapest is home to more than 100 — where tourists can relax and experience the best of Hungarian culture most times of the year. From historical places with outstanding architecture to calming retreats in rural areas.
Travelers usually enjoy eating local food with unique flavors and exotic combinations. I can now say that the goulash is one of my favorite soups, and the Hungarian pizza, the Langallo, must be added to any traveler’s bucket list.
Enriching Experiences Beyond Food And Spas
Hungary has so much to offer. Those who enjoy a fun night can have a special time at the ruin bars or try one of Budapest’s top attractions: take a Danube River cruise.
History lovers will be amazed at all the drama related to Empress Elisabeth of Austria — known as Sissi — and can also admire the sculptures and all the incredible stories behind them.
Even though the predominant religion is Catholic, visitors can see fascinating buildings and chapels from different religions like the Great Synagogue of Budapest — the largest in Europe — or Matthias Church on Castle Hill in Budapest.
Depending on your travel plans, there are also festivals, events, and new attractions. Hungary is one of those destinations that make you want to go back even before you leave.

Budapest, Hungary.
We've had fun over these last few weeks trying to figure out how to ask the most basic of questions, “Do you speak English” which at face value doesn't sound overly difficult. You would be mistaken. Our brains are like sieves and as quick as I pour the “Sprechen Sie Englisch?”, “mluvíš anglicky” and “beszélsz angolul” in, it falls right back out. Personally, I blame the internet.
As you start getting hit with travel fatigue and a loss of direction on big trips like these, there are some cities which pull you right back into the fray and make you realise how beautiful Europe during Christmas can be. Budapest certainly falls into this category and after almost two months, two continents and nine countries deep we needed it.
Our first few days saw us checking out the usual city landmarks of castles, churches and Christmas markets and they certainly didn't disappoint in any way. The awe-inspiring Buda Castle in the aptly named Castle district where we visited an underground labyrinth (used as a war shelter, jail and even linked to Dracula!) was amazing. The stunning St Stephens Basilica and Fishermans Bastion; everywhere you look there is something gorgeous and jaw-dropping.
The highlight of this city was definitely the natural hot spring baths of Széchenyi, opened in 1913 and looking the part. Three huge outdoor pools (25°C–35°C) and a multitude of indoor pools, spas and steaming hot saunas. The snow falling all around and -4°C at arrival made it even more special. I highly recommend Budapest to anyone and everyone.
Christmas day was spent in Krakow, Poland and was indeed a white one. I will say it was a quiet few days for us as George came down with a nasty bout of the flu. I took to the streets myself and kept the step counter going by walking the wet and snowy alleys and side paths. Up to Wawel castle, through the Jewish quarter and around Old town.
While in Krakow we visited the Auschwitz concentration camp for the day. It sits about 60kms out of Krakow, it covers a massive area, contains multiple different camps and is about as sombre as you can imagine. It didn't feel right to take a heap of photos or selfies out of consideration for every one that passed through this place so I've only included a couple of the complex.
Next stop is Warsaw and then the Baltic states for New Year's Eve. Bring it on.
Gary.

Here is my take on this exercise from a previous series of posts — How To Read A Screenplay:
After a first pass, it’s time to crack open the script for a deeper analysis and you can do that by creating a scene-by-scene breakdown. It is precisely what it sounds like: A list of all the scenes in the script accompanied by a brief description of the events that transpire.
For purposes of this exercise, I have a slightly different take on scene. Here I am looking not just for individual scenes per se, but a scene or set of scenes that comprise one event or a continuous piece of action. Admittedly this is subjective and there is no right or wrong, the point is simply to break down the script into a series of parts which you then can use dig into the script’s structure and themes.
The value of this exercise:
* We pare down the story to its most constituent parts: Scenes.
* By doing this, we consciously explore the structure of the narrative.
* A scene-by-scene breakdown creates a foundation for even deeper analysis of the story.

The Grand Budapest Hotel
Scene by Scene Breakdown

1–2: In present day, a girl enters Old Lutz Cemetery. She stops at a bust of ‘Author’, memorialized with hotel-room keys hanging on hooks. She holds a book, ‘The Grand Budapest Hotel’, with the Author’s face on the back cover. Twenty years prior, in his study, the same-aged author, begins the narration of the story.
2–6: The late sixties. The author describes how he came to take up rooms in the once-celebrated GBH, and laments its “present” state and descent into shabbiness. It is sparsely populated by a rather solitary group of vacationers, and overseen by the second-rate concierge M. Jean.
Introducing Mr. Moustafa. A figure projecting true loneliness. M. Jean provides an overview of his rags to riches story and the author is intrigued. The primer on Mr. Moustafa is interrupted as M. Jean sprints to action, to save a fat businessman from choking on his biscotti.
6–8: Fate intervenes, and the author and Mr. Moustafa meet in the hammam. Mr. Moustafa opens a polite conversation by stating his admiration for the author’s work. “How did you come to buy it… the Grand Budapest?”, the curious author inquires. Mr. Moustafa invites him to dine and to hear his story.
8: Mr. Moustafa commences the narration of the main story: ‘It begins of course with…’
Part 1: “M. Gustave”
9–16: M. Gustave, in his element, directing hotel staff in the service of guests. An elegant, well-oiled (and well-perfumed) machine. He sits with Madame C.V.D.u.T. (referred to in the script as “Madame D.”). It soon becomes apparent that M.G. is personally redefining “customer service”. He attempts to soothe her fearful intuition that they will never see each other again. They exchange “I love you”s, and he abruptly dispatches Madame D.’s driver to Lutz. As M. Gustave dictates to the lobby boy he suddenly realizes that he doesn’t know him.
16–19: Young Zero Moustafa’s interview begins. He has “zero” experience, education, or family, but impresses M.G. with a perfect answer to a deceptively tricky question.
19–20: Montage: Lobby Boy training begins. M. Gustave will be Zero’s counselor and guardian.
Zero performs the various and sundry tasks and duties of his position, anticipating the needs of the guests, with discretion as a guiding principle.
21–22: Zero begins to realize that, with respect to M. Gustave, “many of the guests came for him”, and that it “was also his pleasure.”
22–23: A day in the life, as Zero awakens in his tiny room and quickly grooms himself.Gustave sermonizes and recites from a small podium in the mess hall as the staff is served.
M.G. dines in a small room, nearly identical to Zero’s, but well-stocked with “L’air de Panache”.
23: Deputy Kovacs arrives to review the books with M. Gustave and business manager Herr Becker. Kovacs also conveys messages on behalf of the mysterious, unidentified owner of the GBH.
23–24: Introducing Agatha. Plain, graceful, seventeen years old, with a birthmark the shape of Mexico on the side of her face. She works a rolling pin in Mendl’s patisserie and has the air of a true artisan. She rides her bicycle through the town, a yoke bearing pink boxes balanced across her shoulders. Mr. Moustafa’s story ends abruptly: “ — but we won’t discuss that.”
Part 2: “Madame C.V.D.u.T.”
24–26: Carrying a stack of newspapers, Zero scans the headlines and comes to a stop. He dashes off to share the news with M. Gustave: Madame D. is dead. M.G.: “We must go to her.” He instructs Zero to pack quickly… and to bring a bottle of the Pouilly-Jouve ‘26.
26–31: As the train speeds toward Lutz, they sit in the first class cabin drinking chilled white wine. M.G. assesses the situation, particulary the disposition and motives of Madame D.’s family. He waxes philosophic, and rather bluntly discusses their physical intimacy.
The train comes to an abrupt halt in the middle of nowhere, and soldiers burst into their cabin. They ask them to produce papers, and briefly question Zero. M.G.’s charm offensive fails, and the soldiers sieze Zero against the protestations of his guardian. Cpt. Henckels arrives, having heard the commotion. He recognizes M. Gustave and apologizes, ordering his and Zero’s release. He gives Zero a temporary transit permit.
Gustave favorably notes the “faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity.”
31–34: They arrive in Lutz, at Madame D.’s mansion. Clotilde the maid attends to them.
Gustave surveys Madame D.’s corpse and expresses his admiration for her appearance. She has finally gotten in right… in death.
The butler M. Serge, via Clotilde, asks for a word with M.G. He and Zero wait for a moment for Serge, who is seen through the glass looking agitated and distraught.
34–39: M. Gustave impatiently marches into the Grand Hall, where relatives close and distant have gathered, their greed roused.
Kovacs enters and unceremoniously deposits onto a podium a large pile of documents that comprise Madame D.’s last will and testament. He sums up her intention as granting the bulk of the estate to Dimitri, her son, but then refers to an “additional codicil” recently received but not yet legally verified.
He reads the codicil: M. Gustave receives the priceless painting “Boy with Apple”.
Dimitri, outraged, confronts M.G., questioning both his intentions and his virility. A punchout, with the final blow struck by Dimitri’s muscle, Jopling.
39–42: M.G. goes to leave. Waiting again for the still agitated Serge, he piques Zero’s interest and they go to have a look at the painting. Zero suggests, first with his eyes, then by fetching a footstool, that possession is nine tenths of the law.
Serge wraps the painting for them, but not before surreptitiously inserting a letter marked “Confidential”. He remains cryptic, preferring to say no more. They depart for the train station.
42–44: In their train compartment at night, M. Gustave and Zero make a pact. They will sell “Boy with Apple”, with Zero to receive a commission, and then “lay low somewhere along the Maltese Riviera until the troubles blow over”. M.G. also bequeaths his belongings to Zero upon his death in exchange for Zero’s assistance.
44–45: Back at The Grand Budapest, they hide and lock up the painting. One of the bellboys advises that the police have arrived and are asking for M. Gustave. M.G. warns Zero to remain silent before the authorities. They announce his arrest. He acknowledges the murder, as if having suspected it, then suddenly bolts to escape. The policemen give chase.
Part 3: “Checkpoint 19 Criminal Internment Camp”
45–49: Zero visits M. Gustave, whose eyes are blackened. He has had to prove his virility to his new best friends.
Zero has spoken to Kovacs, who in flashback explains the theory of M.G.’s guilt to zero. Serge is revealed to have been the “witness” to M.G.’s illegal entry. Zero attempts to encourage M. Gustave and leaves him with a courtesan au chocolat from Mendl’s.
49–50: The dark, menacing Jopling visits the sister of Serge, looking for him. He continues his search by night, speeding through the city on his black motorcycle.
50–52: Zero reads a letter from M.G. to the staff, dictating his wishes and effectively managing the hotel from prison. Zero embodies the presence of M. Gustave, even taking the time to recite his tediously florid stanzas from the podium.
52–56: M. Gustave makes friends in prison, serving mush to a scar-faced giant, then sharing a beautiful, decadent Mendl’s pastry with Pinky and the gang. Ludwig sums up the physical challenges of an escape. They’ve found a possible way out, but need digging tools.
56: Returning to Mr. Moustafa, who cries as he recounts to the author the role Agatha played.
56–58: Zero and Agatha’s romance. He proposes, she accepts. He presents her with a gift of poetry.
58–59: M. Gustave interviews Agatha, ostensibly on Zero’s behalf. He playfully flirts with her and gives her gifts — a white porcelain pendant and five dozen white tulips — arousing Zero’s jealousy.
59–60: The equally brave and skilled Agatha hides digging tools in pastries so beautifully decorated that the “slice and dice” guard decides against damaging them with his cleaver.
60–62: Kovacs attempts to counsel Dimitri and family but they refuse his advice, uninterested in either the legal process or the intentions of the deceased. Jopling throws Kovacs’ cat out the window.
62: M. Gustave and the inmates are making progress, digging through the floor of their cell.
62–64: Zero sneaks into Agatha’s room and they share a couple’s moment together. He tells her of the stolen painting. She refuses to participate or even accept the note describing its location. He leaves it for her anyway.
64–66: Jopling rejoins his pursuit of Kovacs, following him to and through the darkened art museum. He slams shut an exit door, cutting off Kovacs’ escape route and his fingers, then delivers the death blow.
Later Herr Becker receives a message from the office of Kovacs, postponing their scheduled meeting indefinitely.
67–75: Zero arrives by bus to a dark, deserted roadside. He makes his way to an open area with a manhole, and seems to be waiting.
Lights out in the prison, and the inmates make their escape. M. Gustave’s large, scar-faced friend aides them by silencing a would-be whistle blower. One inmate loses his life as he assassinates three guards gathered around a card table.
They exit through the manhole, to the waiting Zero. M.G. introduces them all and begins to pontificate. The other three beat a hasty retreat to a waiting bus.
For his part, Zero has failed to secure a safe house, an escape route, and has even failed to bring the L’air de Panache. M.G. berates him, until Zero explains how he became a refugee. M.G. delivers a heartful apology on behalf of himself and the hotel, and reiterates to Zero and his affection for him. “We’re brothers”, says Zero.
Gustave makes a collect call to M. Ivan of…
Part 4: “The Society of the Crossed Keys”
76–78: The concierge fraternity jumps into action. A chain of phone calls. Each concierge drops what he is doing — whether giving directions, conducting a chorus of “Happy Birthday”, or administering emergency medical assistance — and delegates to his second in command. “Take over!”
78–81: M. Gustave assesses the situation and tries to make sense of it all, alongside a confused Zero. M. Ivan speeds into frame in his limo and spirits them away to the train station. The society has found Serge and a meeting with him has already been arranged. And M. Ivan has even brought the L’air de Panache.
81–83: Cpt. Henckels discovers their escape and gives “dragnet” instructions. Jopling also begins tracking them.
83–84: Dimitri orders Jopling to step up the aggression with Serge’s sister. He suddenly notices the obscene painting which has taken the place of “Boy with Apple”, and smashes it against a small marble statue.
84–86: M.G. puts Serge’s supposed betrayal in perspective. He expresses to Zero his admiration for Agatha and asks to officiate the wedding.
86–87: Alone in her room, Agatha packs. Hearing a noise, she sticks her head through the frame of the skylight. She sees nothing.
Henckels reads a headline “Young Girl’s Head Found in Laundry Basket”. The basket is brought to him. He reaches in and lifts out the head of Serge’s sister.
Part 5: “Gabelmeister’s Peak”
87–95: In the Alpine foothills, Jopling examines a bloodied document as a young attendant fuels up his motorcycle.
Soldiers catch the scent of L’air de Panache.
Zero and M. Gustave make for their high-altitude rendez-vous with Serge X. A monk instructs that they board the next cable car. Halfway up, another monk intercepts them and switches cable cars with the two, sending them off to the opposite peak. A third monk provides them with robes and bibles to join the choral assembly. The final monk send them to confess.
Serge sits opposite in the confessional box. He tells M.G. that there is a second will, and he has made a second copy. Suddenly his story is interrupted. He has been strangled by a now escaping Jopling.
95–99: As Jopling skis away, M.G. and Zero give chase by sled. They speed down the mountain, with Zero barely able to steer.
Jopling comes to the end of the run and watches as M. Gustave and Zero come barreling down, out of control, slamming into the snow bank at the bottom, then flying through the air. Zero lands head first in the snow, practically disappearing, and M. Gustave is nearly thrown off the edge of the cliff.
As M.G. dangles over the edge, Jopling fractures the ice with the heel of his boot. Graceful even in the face of death, M. Gustave’s poetic verses are rudely interrupted as Zero shoves Jopling off the mountain.
Henckels spots the fugitive and accomplice and warns them not to flee. They flee. Zero’s plan is to steal Jopling’s motorcycle, fetch Agatha, take back “Boy with Apple”, and head for the Maltese Riviera, once and for all. But first, a moment of silence for Serge.
99–109: Mr. Moustafa narrates: “The war began at midnight.” The lobby of the GBH is filled with fascists. It has become “a troops’ barracks”. “Z-Z” symbols are plastered everywhere.
Agatha makes a delivery of pink boxes for the soldiers as M. Chuck manages room logistics for his new guests.
Agatha, alone in the vault, follows Zero’s written instructions and retrieves the wrapped painting. Outside the hotel, M. Gustave and Zero observe from a Mendl’s truck. M.G. laments the state of the Grand Budapest under its new occupants. They watch with concern as Dimitri enters the hotel.
Agatha looks for an escape route, and bee-lines into the elevator, asking the operator for the top floor. Dimitri intercepts her and goes along for the ride, while she nervously avoids eye contact. He eyes the package she’s carrying and gingerly peels back the wrapping. “Boy with Apple”.
Gustave and Zero deliver another stack of pink pastry boxes courtesy of Herr Mendl. Dimitri follows Agatha off the elevator and she makes a break for it. He has lost her in the hallway. As M.G. and Zero step from the elevator Dimitri spots them and opens fire. A shootout ensues as soldiers step out from their rooms to enter the fray. Henckels calls for them to cease fire.
A scream. Agatha, and the painting, hang from the edge of the building. Zero leaps to save her, but overshoots and now dangles from the same railing. They are saved as they crash into the Mendl’s truck below.
She has noticed something on the back of the painting…
Part 6: “The Second Copy of the Second Will”
109–114: Madame D. left everything to M. Gustave: the mansion, the factories, a newspaper syndicate… and the GBH.
M.G. anoints Zero as his successor, the new concierge. He officiates the wedding of Zero and Agatha. Mr. Moustafa recounts how two years later Agatha and his infant son died from the ‘Prussian gripe’.
Zero and Agatha travel with M. Gustave by train toward Lutz. M.G. acknowledges his humble beginnings as a lobby boy, and that Zero finally surpassed him. Agatha recites a stanza about two brothers, “one from the east and one from the west”.
They are again stopped in the middle of nowhere by fascist thugs. This time they are not so lucky. The leader rips up Zero’s transit papers. M. Gustave steps up to defend him.
Back to 1965: Mr. Moustafa reveals that the soldiers shot him.
114–117: In summing up M. Gustave he echoes his mentor’s own words. “There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse once known as humanity. He was one of them.”
The author inquires hesitantly as to why Mr. Moustafa has traded a great fortune for this doomed hotel. He kept it for Agatha. Her crossed-keys pendant is pinned to his jacket.
The author sits alone writing in a small notebook.
“It was an enchanting old ruin, but I never managed to see it again.”
The author at seventy five sits alone writing in a small notebook.
Back to present day. The girl sits on a bench, finishing the final chapter of “The Grand Budapest Hotel”.

The most important thing I learned is that my Magyar definitely needs some work!
I also realized that I have accepted that certain cuisines are not globally popular for a good reason. I have disliked food from other countries but that was not the case in Hungary. I did not dislike it but I was not blown away with it either. Maybe I did not try all the right places but made an attempt based on TripAdvisor and Yelp reviews. When I travel with my son I prefer hotel rooms with Breakfast included because the little guy is not exactly the most patient toddler so that does remove one meal off any day.
That was the only thing about my trip that skews towards the disappointed side of a straight line so I started with it. Now lets move onto why Budapest is sooooo amazing because I loved generally everything else about it. I am writing this about a month after the trip but that is one memorable and beautiful city! If you have ever read about Budapest I am confident that the first thing you will read about is the attractiveness of the city. It’s like that pretty girl you can’t help but look more than once.
Ok so onto the trip, we stayed at the Budapest Marriott. It was an older looking hotel from the outside but the inside was great! If you enjoy views get a room with a view of the river. A disclaimer from me, I have a friend who got me a friends and family rate otherwise I probably would not have stayed at a non chain hotel because American chains are almost always more expensive than their local counterparts. The breakfast at the hotel tasted like Marriott food which means it was predictable but very good and expansive. Back to the view, awesome. My son featured in a great deal of pictures with it in the background and since I am an IPhone camera pro they obviously came out great and it was all my doing.
Moving on. The stuff I think I enjoyed the most with a young child was:
Budapest Castle,
walking down Andrassy Avenue to Heroe’s square,
the walk across the Chain bridge(or any bridge really across the Danube),
the city parks we stopped by,
There was also some spring festival type event going on at Vati Utca with music playing along with food and drink stalls that kept him occupied.
Finally my absolute favorite thing was Szechenyi baths and pools. So when you read on the internet you will get some confusing information about whether it is ok to take your children to the pools. Well here is the final word on that based on my personal experience so take it to the bank. If you kid is not a jerk you should be good to go! Here are the caveats because you knew they were coming. We only took the little guy into the HUGE pools. Basically here it is step by step, layman’s terms, if you will. You walk in and there are some counters where you buy tickets. It was packed when we went. They have a menu of options on these little flyers near those ticket counters in various languages so grab yours but regardless of what it says at minimum get a private cabin changing room. Quit being cheap. Its actually not crazy expensive but I think its the minimum for a basic level of comfort if you have a family. If your solo or with all adults maybe other options will work. The cabins are all over the damn place so an attendant will show you one and its basically a tiny little room you can change and store your stuff in. The storing stuff being important. Our umbrella stroller fit like a charm. The other thing is if your sharing cabins between people they are tiny so I would not recommend going in all at once. Anyways, once your ready you go through this huge complex which is all medicinal pools. We skipped all of those because they may or may not be good for a small toddler. When you get outside you’ll find the huge pools I mentioned. It was packed!! Heres the kicker…plenty of kids having a good time. Since you are in a crowded space you’ll probably want to keep the kiddos under control as not to disturb others but for the most part everyone seemed ok with it. If you want to check out the inside you can do what we did and go one by one while the other entertained. All in all great way to spend a day, experience something local, and entertain a rugrat. As if they knew what I was thinking I later saw in our hotel magazine(that one WHERE magazine thats in every room in every hotel, in every place ever), I seriously need to work for that company that sometimes they turn those polls into pool/club parties. EBC in Budapest if you will. I obviously didn’t attend but I would have. Ohhh, actually come to think of it we had a tough time finding a swim diaper for the little guy anywhere so we used the extra thick night diapers but were checking all the time to make sure he didn’t code brown or yellow so save some peace of mind and bring swim diapers!!
My other favorite thing was the hospital under the rock behind/under Budapest castle. This was a suggestion from my parents and what a cool if somewhat underfunded museum. Tickets were expensive but I think they had discounts for students or people who took the bus tour of the city. Incidentally, there seemed to be 3 big companies offering that tour. We took the red\yellow bus one and it was ok. It was just called the hop on\hop off tour. Bought the tickets at the hotel because they were the same price as the door which was surprising to me but they let me pay with my card so you know, points. The big bus tour company buses actually looked better to me from what I saw on the outside but since I did not experience it I can’t really say they are. Back to the museum, its all underground and basically they show you how they ran this intense hospital under the castle during war times. I usually get real yawny at museums but this one was cool if not depressing. One of those reflective, I am so glad to be born where and when I was born type moments(yay genetic lottery). My son happened to sleep through most of itso I don’t know how it would have been had be been awake but my guess is that it would have been fine since the space is tiny inside. Mostly would have had to keep him from touching everything.
Finally, we took a few Ubers to get to starting points but really your doing yourself an injustice if you don’t walk around everywhere. Quit being lazy.
Notes and recap:
Vati Utca — Its like a happening street with restaurants, shops, bars, etc. Touristy like any social area of any big city but if your reading this your probably a tourist.
Andrassy Avenue, think Rodeo Drive(not as expensive). Fancy shops, beautiful architecture, Mcdonalds, Burger King, and Starbucks. They also have the miniversum, this pretty cool tiny train museum which would be better if you could interact more with the trains rather than just watch them but from their perspective it would probably get destroyed really fast if they let that happen so never mind what I have to say. If you have kids they may enjoy checking it out. The play area in the back with some barely working trains was great for a toddler though. We sat there for 2 hours at least while the little guy went to town. My croc water sandal fell out of the stroller at the miniversum so if anyone finds it let me know!
Faust Winery — Found this place on tripadvisor. Like the hospital it is underground in a cavernous space under Budapest castle very close to the Hilton nearby. Really cool wine tasting experience. The couple that was running it were super friendly and seemed informed, not that I could have told you if they were not. I just tend to nod my head when someone asks if I am getting the fruity notes. I do like wine though so we tasted some really great local stuff. It was 20 bucks a head for 6 tastings and solid pours. A really cool date place from the look of it in case you happen to have a date in Budapest is my favorite way of describing it, plus a good chance the other person winds up a little buzzed so you will be more interesting without even trying! My one advice because its a real cool setting and you don’t want to be the people with children running around in there try to plan your tasting around a nap time. Its super chilly and dark in there so my little guy slept great in his stroller.
Tokaji — We did not actually go to the wine region because its a long car trip but totally doable for adults from what I could gather. Unreasonable with a little one so we did the next best thing. We bought and tasted a bunch. Tokaji is a sometimes sweet white wine that is delicious if you like that sort of thing. I do. The Mrs., not so much but since its my blog and not hers I think you should drink up as much as you can. They have a rating scale for them which obviously effects costs so you can read up on that if your interested. We tried a few at the Faust cellars mentioned above so maybe ask them what to get. Hungarian Wine ftw!
Thats all I have for now but any questions let me know and I can try to help. This was a on the surface first trip for me and I hope I get to make it back to explore more and maybe make it out to wine region. We had a blast in Mendoza, Argentina and honestly liked it better than Napa so I am always game for new regions revolving around booze.
I am a new writer but am enjoying it so far. People often ask me for travel advice so thought I would just make it public. Hopefully its simplified enough that the work is just done for you. That is the goal at least. I am sure it will be a work in progress. I will also post them to my blog at www.jaideeps.com. Sign up, I have some other topics too that I enjoy writing about especially as I learn more about them. Hope of one of them makes life easier for you!

People always ask me for travel advice since I travel frequently for leisure. Never wrote it down before! Beyond that I also write about anything I’m working on

Wes Anderson’s picture book masterpiece for the ages
Last Saturday I revisited the unloved Christopher Nolan masterpiece The Prestige and last night, with the now inevitable drawing in of the heatwave summer nights, I continued with an aged custom of my “Saturday Night Film Club” and treated myself to another trip to The Grand Budapest Hotel. As you will gather if you read the entirety of the opus blog article I’ve gratuitously plugged and linked to the end of this opening paragraph, I’m rather in love with the films of Wes Anderson and my love-in articles on Isle of Dogs (2018) and The French Dispatch (2021) can also be found deep within my film archives.
No great revelations here. No deep dive into the merits of a masterpiece that only time and an open consciousness will appreciate.
Just oodles of love for a cinematic masterpiece and a gratuitous plug for a film article I wrote many years ago?
As the inhabitants of the Coen Brothers film Fargo would say
“You Betcha!”
medium.com
“I’m afraid that’s me darling!”
I consider myself very fortunate to see Wes Anderson’s eighth film just after opening night at my local picture house and instantly fell in love with it. For personal reasons only I rank it second in my all time personal favourite films of his but sixteen years after Rushmore it truly runs it close for my all time favourite. The Grand Budapest Hotel is far more elegant, poetic and picturesque than Rushmore and I adore the comic book/picture book feel of the film. It’s timeless flow and imagination makes an instant re-watching an easy decision, especially when you consider the film itself is almost a film within a film, within a film. The three separate time periods of 1985, 1968 and 1932 flow together seamlessly and whilst the film may be predominantly set in the 1930’s the movements forward in time are never jarring or awkward and simply add to the majesty of this wonderful film. As I write this ode to joy on 1st October 2014 the Oscar buzz has not yet started but surely this is the breakthrough film of Oscar recognition Wes Anderson has thoroughly deserved since the eponymous Rushmore sixteen long years ago. Whilst Oscars are not the yardstick by which to measure a film’s success, we can but hope.
The film is inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig (who is thanked in the closing credits) but Anderson and fellow writer Hugo Guinness deserve an Oscar nomination for their surreal screenplay and for the poetic, dancing dialogue given to Ralph Fiennes and Jeff Goldblum, both of whom pull of their linguistic treats to perfection but more of this later. Robert Yeoman’s cinematography is again inspired, adding to the picture book texture of the film and combined with Adam Stockhausen’s production design and miniature models provide so many endearing and effective cinematic shots that deserve Oscar recognition in 2015 but the same can be said for Milena Canonero’s wonderful array of costumes that truly are a centre piece of the film, Anna Pinnock’s set decoration and Stephen Gessler’s art direction are all worthy of recognition and in Oscar circles, if it’s The Grand Budapest’s year in 2015, all will be worthy recipients of the prized statue. The film is such an incredible achievement Wes Anderson’s entire behind the scenes crew deserve special praise for realising an astonishing looking film that enchants you with every watch, but a final nod goes to Film Editor Barney Pilling for weaving together three differing timelines, so many narrative strands and of course, the long held Wes Anderson trademarks which proliferate the film and work so wonderfully well as ever.
In front of the camera is a real ensemble cast of returning actors from previous Anderson films or A-List first timers that each portray highly original character creations that I will briefly appraise below. But to whet your appetite we have, in no particular order: a dastardly double dealing Frenchman, a vicious German enforcer, a spurned son, a pompous writer, a heavily tattooed yet loquacious prison inmate, an equally loquacious lawyer, a bizarre local Captain of the Military, a beautiful pastry chef, several surreal concierges, one strident, wistful, foul mouthed yet sweet tongued lothario who also occasionally acts as a concierge, oh, and a Lobby Boy named Zero! All of whom are in the very capable hands of Ralph Fiennes, Adrien Brody, Bill Murray, F Murray Abraham, Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Mathieu Amalric, Edward Norton, Jude Law, Saoirse Ronan, Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson, Tony Revolori, and returning favourites Owen Wilson and Jason Schwartzman.
The opening frame of the film sets the tone and immediately you’re aware this is a Wes Anderson film. All three time periods of 1985, 1968 and 1932 were shot in different aspect ratios to suitably reflect the change in period so don’t adjust your set! The film has a continuing narration throughout however the narrator changes with the time period and firstly in 1985 we have the bizarre spectacle of “Author” (Tom Wilkinson) narrating direct to camera whilst being shot at by his son with an air gun!. We now jump back to 1968 and the second of our narrators “Young Writer” (Jude Law) who details the demise of the once opulent and highly regarded Grand Budapest Hotel, located in Zubrowka, a fictional European town high in the hills and formerly a hive of activity that attracted only the very wealthy prior to the outbreak of war in the 1930’s. But here in 1968 it is now rather decrepit and a monument to a bygone age but which still retains it character and remnants of it’s more luxurious past and now houses singular visitors who keep themselves to themselves whilst passing through. The Young Writer is wont to stand “elbow to elbow” of an evening with “M.Jean” (Jason Schwartzman) the hotel’s current incumbent in the role of concierge and the returning Schwartzman is excellently bizarre in a small cameo role. M.Jean alerts the young writer to the exception to the visitors who pass nominally through the hotel, “Mr Moustafa” (F Murray Abraham) the current owner of the hotel, and through “fate” the young writer is able to ask the scene setting question to Mr Moustafa of how he came to own such a grand building with such grand history and with such a grand tale to tell? The particular tale Mr Moustafa tells is of intrigue, suspense, murder, philandering and of colourful characters in very colourful and bizarre circumstances. It’s also a tale of young love, a Lobby Boy named Zero and a loquacious concierge who came to own the priceless painting of “Boy With Apple” and the story is told, indeed narrated, over an evening meal between the two men as they dine in the huge, imposing dining hall of the Grand Budapest Hotel.
Wes Anderson’s masterpiece is split into five parts (each with it’s own title slide naturally) and are occasionally preceded by a slight change in the colour palette of the film. All Anderson hallmarks are present and correct: overhead shots, extreme close ups on books, paintings, newspapers, sepia tinged photographs, together with beautiful rolling camera shots, surreal inserts (look out for the cloakroom ticket!), plus there’s the obligatory “man hanging out of a window” shot that has appeared in nearly all of his films. The picture book style of the film is an absolute joy, the narrative blending with the bizarre character creations perfectly and every frame has been meticulously planned to the nth degree. But what impresses me time and time again in Anderson’s eight cinematic offering are the small segments of scenes not seen in his previous works. The multi doors sweeping open as we approach the reading of the will and “Zero” (Tony Revolori) about to commence the obligatory reading of the concierge letter and poem before the staff’s evening meal but an instant cutaway to an imprisoned “M.Gustave” (Ralph Fiennes) and his surreal reading of the letter whilst surrounded by unemotional fellow inmates and prison officers are two examples of many. The chase in the Kunstmuseum is just phenomenal and a credit to the genius Director of Photography Robert Yeoman, as is the prison escape sequence and only surpassed by the acting and prose delivered by Tony Revolori and Ralph Fiennes at it’s touching, yet amusing denouement.
These are but minor examples of so many brilliant scenes devised and shot through the prism of Messrs Anderson and Yeoman lens but even these are topped by a Wes Anderson staple, but with a twist! The film’s touching love story centres on Zero and the beautiful “Agatha” (Saoirse Ronan) and during their early courtship they enjoy a merry-go-round ride that is simply shot and ended with an Anderson hallmark of a straight on extreme close up on Agatha but rather than an unemotional shot (as is the norm) she is bright eyed and smiling. All five parts or acts of the film are an absolute joy, and here’s a very brief dissection of a very colourful cast of characters:
“M.Gustave” (Ralph Fiennes) Busy yet meticulous concierge of The Grand Budapest Hotel in the 1930’s who has a penchant for fine wine, blonde haired older ladies and L’air de Penache’. Has a wonderful linguistic use of English and a lothario who calls everyone, regardless of sex, as “darling”.
A stellar performance worthy of a 2015 Oscar.
“Zero” (Tony Revolori) Zero experience and zero family and friends. Deeply in love with his beloved Agatha but don’t you dare flirt with her! Following numerous roles in TV and short films, this is Tony’s first major role and many more are sure to follow this accomplished performance.
“Young Writer” (Jude Law) Well spoken writer, English Gentleman, European traveller and one of the film’s numerous narrators who’s told an incredible tale in an incredible dining room in an incredible film.
A cameo yet important role from Law.
“Mr Moustafa” (F Murray Abraham) Quiet and unassuming owner of The Grand Budapest Hotel who remains utterly devoted to Agatha, deeply misses his “Agatha” and has an intriguing tale to tell. It maybe a cameo role but it’s F Murray Abraham — what else do you need to know?
“Agatha” (Saoirse Ronan) Owner of Zero’s heart, saviour and bravest of the film’s eclectic and surreal cast of characters and she’s far more than a mere “pastry chef”. Atonement, The Lovely Bones and now The Grand Budapest Hotel, Ronan’s star is on the rise and justifiably so.
“Henckels” (Edward Norton) Surreal Captain of the Local Military who is big on moustaches, quizzical looks and very definitely not “Little Albert” anymore! A priceless cameo from the ever dependable Edward Norton.
“Nobody move. Everybody’s under arrest!”.
“Ludwig” (Harvey Keitel) Heavily tattooed prison inmate who can see the vulnerability of their “flophouse” and impresses M.Gustave with his artistic talents. Only included here as he’s a cherished actor I greatly admire and can drive any distance in just nine minutes and thirty seven seconds!
“Deputy Kovacs” (Jeff Goldblum) An eloquent, elegant and operatic cameo from a deadpan and utterly brilliant Goldblum as a conflicted but straight as a die lawyer. But please, don’t mention his cat!
“Dmitri” (Adrien Brody) Angry, very, very angry spurned son of a wealthy departed blonde lady who’s missing a priceless painting. As eloquent as his fellow characters but with a rather more foul mouth than the rest, even in front of his sisters! Yet another superb performance from Brody in an Anderson film.
“Jopling” (Willem Dafoe) Ruthless family enforcer who is also a remarkably accomplished motorbike rider and Olympic skier! An almost wordless performance but there’s nothing quiet or subtle about Jopling’s methods of disposal. Another returnee to an Anderson film and another accomplished and important cameo from Dafoe.
Supporting these premier roles are many more fleeting and cameo roles from Mathieu Amalric as a strangely staring French concierge “Serge X”, Bill Murray as the ever helpful “M.Ivan”, Jason Schwartzman as the comical concierge “M.Jean”, Tilda Swinton as the ill fated and fabulously wealthy “Madame D”, Owen Wilson as concierge “M.Chuck”, Florian Lukas as “Pinky”, Karl Markovics from the utterly brilliant and highly recommended film of 2007 The Counterfeiters as “Wolf”, a returning Bob Balaban as “M.Martin” and fellow returnees to a Wes Anderson film of Wallace Wolodarsky as concierge “M.George” and Waris Ahluwalia as concierge “M.Dino”.
A truly stellar ensemble cast in a wonderfully spellbinding film that showcases the very best in the Director of this magnum opus of a love in, Wes Anderson. I cannot recommend his films enough and The Grand Budapest may be his best yet and come 2015, hopefully he will receive further Oscar recognition to go with this particular film fan’s total admiration for his vision and desire to produce visually stunning pieces of cinematic art.

While writing and researching in Budapest last year, we ate a couple of times at a local restaurant that takes enormous pride in its food and service (Kispiac) and went there for our last evening meal before leaving Budapest.
The owner asked us about our time in Budapest and whether we’d like to return. Before we left, he came out with a bottle of Hungarian sparkling tokaji as a going away gift. Whilst Hungarians are rarely effusive, we found them helpful and generous — I can’t imagine that kind of gesture from a London restaurant after a couple of visits.
Budapest is an extraordinary place — there’s a quiet kindness in so many people — unshowy, but vital. There’s also deep melancholy — a history replete with suffering and ongoing political corruption and extremism.
It’s a place where beautiful Art Nouveau buildings are sometimes fading and uncared for. There are architectural gems are so in need of restoration that chunks of masonry fall into the street (we saw two passers-by almost felled by falling stone). And yet there’s also pride in good service and good food, in art and architecture, in being humane.
When I arrived, one of the themes in my novel was the debate over whether Attila József committed suicide or died in a tragic accident. The preponderance of opinion has always been that his death was by suicide, but I wanted to leave the question open, to stay with the ambiguity.
A conversation with László Kúnos of Corvina Press convinced me otherwise. Sad as it is to believe that this exceptional man chose to kill himself, the more I read the poetry and biographies, the more I realised that there is an internal logic to the life and death.
This is a scene when I’ve explored this in the novel:
She walks back slowly. She will go to the place where he wrote when editing the magazine, Beautiful Word, another day, but the statue on the Danube near the Parliament building is only a short detour on the route to her apartment.
József sits, coat thrown down beside him, hat in his hand, watching the river, the epitome of contemplation and lament. He looks as though he’d spent the day walking across this city searching for something, Catherine thinks. The lines from ‘By the Danube’ are in a facsimile of József’s handwriting: Mintha szivembôl folyt volna tova Zavaros, bölcs és nagy volt a Duna — As if it flowed straight from my heart / Troubled, wise and great was the Danube.
How was it that Székely translated those lines? Catherine asks the statue.
As if my own heart had opened its gate:
The Danube was turbulent, wise and great.
She thinks of the conversation with Margit and András, how a thing mutates between languages, but even in one language how every action, every nuance is open to interpretation.
Catherine sits on the bottom step beneath Attila, looking towards the Danube with him. When she begins to feel stiff and colder she walks towards the figure, touches his hand.
There is such melancholy here, she tells him. Suicide seems to be everywhere, your language is unlike any neighbouring country’s, your borders have changed, to say there has been one too many invasion is an understatement and even your national anthem talks of pity and sorrow. So much sadness and I have endless questions for you that you can’t answer. Did you kill yourself? I’m minded to agree with Margit and András that you did. Why didn’t you take another route? And the strangest question of all — Did you know a woman called Selene Solweig Virág?
At the Attila József Museum, I was further convinced that the poet took his own life. We took a tram to the south of the city to the IXth District. It was the most run-down area we visited and a shock after the picturesque tram-ride along the Danube. It was a blazing hot day and we were glad to find that museum after only ten minutes walking.
When we found the museum there seemed to be no way in, but after a rather halting phone call a curator let us in. We weren’t charged the entrance fee and had the museum to ourselves for two hours. The curator was helpful and delighted to have visitors. All this investment and care and no-one there.
The place was beautifully presented, tiny yet brimming with photos, artefacts and interactive displays. There are first edition copies of his collections, the pencil he wrote with, notebooks, letters and a copy of his birth certificate.
Attila could fall in love in minutes and does so with my character, Selene, who never appears in the histories or photographs as she is not from the same time as Attila. She may be imagining her relationship with him during the trauma of her imprisonment after the 1956 Uprising. Or perhaps not? Either way, she fits the pattern of József’s often unrequited and always difficult love life.
Ah, Catherine? the curator asks. I am with you.
Márta Tákacs appears moments later and Catherine holds out her hand to shake. They walk through a small courtyard and into the ground floor two-roomed apartment, Marta tall and elegant, her fair hair held behind a blue band that matches her eyes.
People come from everywhere, Márta says as they enter.
The walls are covered in black and white photographs. Catherine notes the picture of József’s father in military uniform that she has a copy of and one of his mother that she has not seen previously. Borbála is young and pretty, with soft features. Another image shows a house further along the street where the family lived when József was a toddler — It says: Papa disappeared from this flat, Márta says, translating legend.
By the door a map shows another nineteen apartments that the family lived in after Attila ran back to his mother from the foster family at Öcsöd, who set him to work as a five-year-old swineherd.
They were constantly thrown out for not being able to pay the rent, Márta tells her. Attila was lucky that later his brother-in-law paid for his education so he didn’t have to go on sell newspapers for a living. In his childhood, he’d already known work — collecting coal, selling paper whirligigs that he made from scraps to better-off children. In the war he’d queue all night to buy food for the family, only to find that the cooking lard had run out and there was nothing to be had by eight in the morning. He was only fourteen when his mother died and Makai sent him to the Makó boarding school. They tried to send him to a seminary too, but he left after a week, telling them he was Orthodox, not Catholic. He got good grades at school, but he was already suffering with depression and tried to kill himself when he was only sixteen. I will leave you to look, she says finally, but I’m in the next room if you have questions.
There are copies of József’s poetry collections on a small table, beginning with Szépség koldusa, Beauty’s Beggar, written when he was seventeen. Catherine lingers over each picture, each book, but feels no sense of Attila in the rooms.
After a while Márta reappears with a set of pictures. These were his women, she says. This one was the daughter of the director of his boarding school — Márta Gebe. He was very young, but she inspired several poems. Then Maria Esprit, this time his landlord’s daughter. And this one is most interesting.
The black and white picture is of a beautiful girl, aquiline features, large eyes, her close-cut bobbed hair under a fashionable cap.
Luca Wallennsz was the daughter of Gitta Genes, a very fine artist and ceramicist. There are beautiful works in the National Gallery. Her husband wrote novels and poetry. Very refined Jewish family. They gave salons and many famous names were there, but Gitta met Attila first in the park. He sat next to her on a bench and declared his love five minutes later. He was only nineteen and she was a mature woman, beautiful, but thirty-six. They became close — not what we would call an affair, but a relationship still. He wrote poems for her, of course, like ‘It was summertime’ and then her daughter, Luca, became interested in the salons and Attila fell in love once more. He wrote her many excellent poems, mostly in ’28. Very beautiful — ‘I bless you with sadness and happiness’ is best known of them, set to music often.
He fell in love often, Catherine notes.
Indeed. And he loved Gitta and Luca at the same time too.
Ah, Catherine says, thinking of Attila loving Flóra and Selene simultaneously.
You will know this one, of course.
Catherine holds the picture of Márta Vágó. Yes. The first serious love of his life, perhaps.
Márta nods. They wrote every day when she first went to London, but the distance was too much to sustain. I think that’s what her parents hoped for. They were wealthy intelligentsia, he was the son of a soap factory worker and a peasant, after all. Márta pauses. And this one –
She hands Catherine an image of Judit Szánto.
I always think the most sad, Márta finishes. She lived with him six years, tried to make a place of security for him. He was very broken after the relationship with Márta Vágó ended. But he said it was ‘not love, but an alliance’. Particularly harsh from a man who loved easily. He wrote one poem, ‘Judit’ and a few scraps that never became poems, that was all. While he was with Judit he met Edit.
Márta hands her the photograph of Edit Gyömrői. She was his doctor and he became … she searches for the word … fixated on her so that another doctor, Robert Bak, had to take over.
And then one day he saw this girl, Márta Márton –
Catherine studies the beautiful young face.
He didn’t know her. He saw her and decided he was in love. He wrote the poem ‘Ode’ for her, an exquisite love poem, and when Judit realised that she was not the muse of this poem, she tried to kill herself. They’d already tried to part earlier, but broke apart after this.
An finally –
The last picture is of Flóra Kozmutza. No picture of Selene, Catherine thinks.
They met at Anna Daniels apartment in February ’37 and were engaged by April, but it was never to be of course.
Catherine nods. Thank you. They’re all so beautiful.
Yes, lovely but sad, Márta adds.
After our final dinner at Kispiac, we walked to the Danube, sat by Attila’s statue and read some of his poetry, including ’By the Danube’.
I very much hoped it would be ‘au revoir’, and not goodbye. And I’m now looking forward to launching the novel in Budapest in November, at the wonderful Massolit bookshop and cafe.
By the Danube.
1.
As I sat on the bottom step of the wharf,
A melon-rind flowed by with the current;
Wrapped in my fate I hardly heard the chatter
Of the surface, while the deep was silent.
As if my own heart had opened its gate:
The Danube was turbulent, wise and great. …

First thing’s first, what’s your name and how old are you?
Julia, 31 years old.
And what do you do, workwise?
Director of Sales at Craft Travel Group.
What was it that attracted you to Nomad House (or coliving in general)?
The chance to visit Budapest and experience a co-living retreat.
Where were you before joining?
All over! In between Miami (my “home”), Madrid, New York and Rio de Janeiro…but I came to Budapest after 3 weeks in Barcelona/Madrid
What advice have you found most helpful, since beginning to travel and work remotely?
Try to establish some sort of routine. Find one place you can work from where you know internet will be good and you’ll have limited distractions. Find one other person who is also looking to get shit done and partner up with them. If you are like me and get distracted by just about anything, you’ll need to try extra hard while traveling to be productive because there is ALWAYS something going on.
Which lessons will you be taking from Nomad House?
So many! First off, it’s amazing how many different people I met from all over with all different interests. I would have never met these people under other circumstances and I’m SO glad I did. I learned so much on both a personal and professional level by living and traveling with this talented, diverse group of like-minded wanderlusters. So I suppose the main lesson would be to always be open-minded and take risks. I signed up to NH Budapest without any idea as to what I was getting into. But it ended up being one of the best weeks of my life.
How has Nomad House shaped your future?
Being around people with so many different professional backgrounds and talents really helped me identify my own strengths and learn from theirs. For example, in talking so much about different ideas and projects I discovered during the retreat that I was much more creative and that I have more entrepreneurial qualities than I thought previously. And by learning about others’ backgrounds I could identify the skills that I definitely DON’T have and understand them a bit better so I would know what/who to look for when pursuing future projects.
How do you feel about this lifestyle now — how do you think it will grow, and will you be trying more coliving programs in the future?
100% more convinced that my life will always involve some mix of co-living/retreat/nomadic activity for the foreseable future. :)
And a quickfire round…
Describe your gear setup [what do you take with you, your essential ‘in kit’ items]
Protein bars- they are my travel must-have because nobody wants to see me cranky. Also sneakers and headphones so I can go running or workout anywhere. And some sleeping pills for those long flights.
Describe your essential apps.
WhatsApp, RunKeeper, American Airlines (I’m obsessive about my Executive Platinum status), Splitwise (discovered during NH Budapest), and of course Tinder. :)
Describe your travel stack [your preferred websites for booking travel].
Kayak, Skyscanner, AA.com
Where can people get in touch with you?
Instagram @julia.crafted, or Craft’s website.

Let me start with the obvious; the colour grading is so unique in its pastel flavours whilst the cinematography is so very peculiar it is almost impossible for these 2 productions to be anything other than engaging, however, even more than this, it is the premise of these 2 films that make them so immensely beautiful to watch. Let me explain.
What truly makes Moonrise kingdom and Grand Budapest Hotel so interesting, engaging and unique is the fact that their storylines are based on delving into the real grit of people with life choices and occupations that we simply don’t think about. Anderson manages to turn what appear like random, uninteresting occupations such as Khaki Scouts and Hotel Bell Boy’s into the premise of his films, and he makes them look so exceptionally interesting.
By the end of the films, you truly believe that it would be exciting and thrilling to be the bell boy of a prestigious yet almost chaotic hotel, or a member of a scout group so regimental it makes school look like an atrocity. By giving small, seemingly unimportant jobs a real and professional status, it allows us as the audience to understand what it must feel like to belong to a group who take even the lightest job as a strict routine that must be followed. That has power.
As a viewer, it makes me wish I had as much passion and discipline as to carry out my job in the way Anderson manages to portray the characters within his film. And that’s what film is all about; allowing the viewer to escape to a reality that they cannot possibly escape to in real life. Without Moonrise Kingdom and The Grand Budapest Hotel, I would not have given hotel staff or scout groups a second thought, and now, I see their lives and their stories as so interesting and different, I can’t help but think of an alternative reality whereby I venture into these professions; but hey, maybe I’ve been watching too much Rick and Morty.

Budapest is in the top 3 best European cities where to party.
Just ask the countless bachelors bringing all their friends over from London for a wild weekend. Or the Erasmus students going crazy on a regular Monday night. Or basically, any young people living in Budapest.
The reason: lots of cool bars + cheap alcohol.
Out of these bars, many of them are ruin pubs, run-down places that emerged from the ruins of ancient buildings and are now one of the most iconic symbols of Budapest.
I am Portuguese but I lived in Budapest for 3.5 years. Pandemic times aside, I explored the nightlife of my beloved home away from home, always arriving home at the end of the night with the same feeling “This is the coolest city in Europe”.
So here are my recommendations for anyone wanting to explore the best bars in Budapest!
The first and most iconic ruin bar of Budapest. Going to Budapest and not visiting Szimpla is like going to Rome and not seeing the Pope. If going out is not your thing, try it during the day, when it’s quiet and you can simply admire the place, or on Sunday morning, when the place hosts a Farmers…

Our two heroes, concierge extraordinaire Monsieur Gustav H (Ralph Finnes) and his lobby boy protégé Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori), sit across the table from each other in a moving railcar headed to the memorial of the tragically deceased Dowager Countess Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton). The mysterious old woman, a close friend (and frequent lover) of M. Gustav, had feared her death was imminent just three months prior, though specifically what she knew remains unclear. In her wake, the vultures are coming, ready to pick apart her financial corpse and no leave aspect of her estate unclaimed. Gustav, however, comes as a dove wishing to pay respect to the woman and ensure that she is as beautiful in death as she was in during her last stay at the Grand Budapest Hotel in Zubrowka. But before they reach their destination the train comes to an abrupt stop in a barley field, invaded by Zig Zag Stormtroopers looking for undesirables which, it seems, includes Zero. It takes Gustav both his tenacity and his previous kindness to the mother of the Zig Zag commander to earn protection for the young refugee. A woman is dead, and Europe seems to be following.
In 1914, Gavrilo Princip’s bullets struck Austria-Hungary’s Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie. They would die together as their car sped away on the streets of Sarajevo, the first domino in a long chain to fall that would lead to The Great War, ending true monarchy in Europe in just four years’ time, and shattering the continent’s economy and stability in the process. The rise of fascism that followed, in hindsight, seems inevitable. By 1945, the Second World War would be fought on many of the same battlefields, an attempt to push back against the totalitarian evils of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, and while the Allied resistance would ultimately win it came at a grave cost — before the midpoint of the twentieth century, Eastern European culture as we knew it was destroyed, replaced with a brutalist architecture and new forms of totalitarianism in the form of Soviet expansion.
When Wes Anderson’s 2014 masterpiece The Grand Budapest Hotel begins, we are not with Gustav at the grand chateau atop the mountain, but in a cemetery after the aforementioned Soviet Union itself has fallen. A young girl has come to visit the grave of a renowned Author (only known as such, played by the great Tom Wilkinson). She greatly admires a book of his and starts to read at the gravesite, one that was written in 1985 about a time in 1968 when he himself visited the titular hotel after its character and history were stripped in favor of the aesthetic du jour in Eastern Europe. No longer does the exterior resemble the pink majesty on the film’s poster, nor does the interior suggest an opulence reserved for royalty. Even the film’s aspect ratio has changed, from a small letterbox to a widescreen vantage like many of the historical epics being made at the time, only serving to contrast the drab and dreary nature of the establishment. The closest thing to culture or opulence we can spot is a painting of a boy holding an apple at the concierge desk.
It is at the hotel that the Author, now portrayed by Jude Law, spies an older gentleman (F. Murray Abraham) sitting patiently for no one in the lobby. When the author inquires about him, all he is told is that the man is the owner of the hotel and that he only stays once or twice a year, and even then, refuses to stay anywhere but a small room with a cot. The two meet in the baths (covered with grimy tile rather than elegant marble) and agree to join each other for dinner. It is there, in a large and empty dining hall, that the old man decides to tell the story of his time as a young lobby boy named Zero, his mentorship under the tutelage of the incredible and indelible Gustav H, and how the hotel came to be in his name.
As we see his story we realize how truly great the Grand Budapest Hotel once was, with its raised balconies, elegant carpentry, vaulted staircases, and chandeliers galore. The clientele is comprised of the world’s upper crust, coming from far and wide to experience the best Zubrowka has to offer, and the staff make it their mission to ensure they get it. The film is now in the nearly-square Academy ratio (again, like the films of its time), turning the wide realism into a jewel box we can’t help but admire. But underneath the majesty is an obvious melancholy, that throughout this fictional tale of excitement and adventure, prison breaks and murder, we are also seeing what we lost when Europe set itself on fire.
Let’s forget, for a second, that the sovereign nation of Zubrowka and the Zig Zag forces are entirely fictional and, instead, recognize the real-world counterparts they represent — Eastern Europe and Nazi Germany, respectively. When most of us today think of the latter we, correctly, picture a fascist, totalitarian, and extremely oppressive regime responsible for the decimation and destruction of numerous minority communities throughout the continent, most notably Jews and Romani. When we think of the former, however, we usually picture a more run-down, war-torn part of the world replete with brutalist architecture, grey skies, and impoverished citizens (like the hotel of the ‘60s). It has been the butt of many jokes throughout Western pop culture, my personal favorite being the incredibly exaggerated Bratislava sequence in 2004’s Eurotrip. It is important to remember, though, that this idea we have of a large swath of Europe is only part of the story and a small one at that. The current state of Eastern Europe is a direct aftermath of two global wars, along with further Soviet occupation and smaller conflicts in places like Bosnia and, most recently, Ukraine. One of the great tragedies of our time, and the main one The Grand Budapest is grappling with, is how much of that region’s culture has been lost, bulldozed, and forgotten in the wake of conflagration.
World War I was a knotty, complicated conflict with no clear good or bad guys to pick from (though much of the allied West was keen to point the finger at Germany and their Kaiser, who they already hated anyway). With two bullets fired from a young man’s gun and the month of confusion that immediately followed, all of Europe’s longstanding treaties and agreements, the same ones that had prevented full-scale continental war throughout a perilous and tumultuous nineteenth century, drove every nation in the area into hell. Young men were enlisted on the promise of national pride only to be used as machine gun fodder in the unmoving trenches in Belgium. Others were sent to Arabia in an attempt to push back the already sickly Ottoman Empire not to liberate the locals but to create desert empires of their own. By the time America was dragged in to help the English and French secure victory from the face of otherwise sure stalemate, all of Europe’s true monarchies had fallen and every nation had, on some level, lost. It was supposed to be “the war to end all wars”, but the emotional crater it left was the perfect cauldron to breed hatred and resentment, and the inevitable power struggle commenced.
Smartly, Grand Budapest is primarily set in 1932, nearly smack dab in between the two world wars. The imagery in the costume and production design is most obviously that of the second, but I believe that much of the early story is actually referencing the first. In that war, despite the hellish destruction, there was a pretend air of dignity attached. When Gustav and Zero are first accosted near a barley field the decorum and history between the commander and the concierge allows for safe passage (presumably in both directions). But when they arrive at the estate it is immediately clear that something is amiss, and the staff is ushering our two heroes away for a private discussion.
What is taking place, as we will soon learn, is a quick reading of the dowager countess’s will, which leaves the bulk of her estate to her ungrateful children — all except the painting “Boy with Apple”, which has been bequeathed to a one M. Gustav H. Much like Europe in the wake of WWI, unhappy with whatever lot they were left with, so, too, is Céline’s son and chief heir, Dmitri (Adrian Brody). Not only is he furious that he wouldn’t receive the entire estate in full, but that even a sliver of it should go to a man far below his station (and, adding insult to injury, the man she was having a lurid affair with). The rest of the film is, essentially, the remnants of the old-world empires grasping at every ounce of power they can and refusing to allow anyone from a lower class to have even a sliver. All Gustav wants is the painting, and many will die in Dmitri’s attempt to get it back.
By compressing the larger time period into a short year, Anderson presents a crisscrossing subtext with numerous overlaps. In our world, the period between the two world wars allowed for the larger societal dissatisfaction to curdle into outright hatred and destructive nationalism. In the film, it happens all at once, with Dmitri using the increasingly oppressive Zig Zag corps to place Gustav in prison for a murder that the son himself almost certainly committed (Céline’s) — the ZZ is more than happy to play along to continue aligning itself with wealth and power. The allegory there is pretty simple as this is, effectively, what happened in Germany as soon as it was clear that the Nazi party was gaining insurmountable ground in the political sphere. Better to team up and consolidate rather than fight back.
What followed, tragically, was the Holocaust — a decade-long massacre across Europe that claimed the lives of an estimated 6 million Jews and millions of others based solely on their religion, ethnicity, political stances, or sexual orientation. Much of Eastern European culture, particularly Polish and Czech, was expressly suppressed and overtaken by the Aryan Reich — what was originally there was deemed too intellectual, too ephemeral, too Jewish. When we return to the hotel in the movie’s third act we see that nearly every shred of pink and rose and red, the ornate nature of the palatial estate we marveled at earlier on, is covered in black banners with ZZ logos. The total decimation of the structure has not yet taken place (the version of the hotel we see in widescreen), but the first attempt is apparent. Rather than tear down and rebuild in their own image, ZZ would rather cover up and pretend it was always theirs.
Working backward, it is no surprise that the monastery in the mountains provides little more than a detour, pretending to help Gustav and Zero find the one informant who can clear the concierge’s name (and, we will learn, knows about the contents of a secret will that has been hidden within the sought-after portrait). Instead, they are so ineffectual as to allow Dmitri’s bodyguard and hitman, J. G. Jopling (Willem Dafoe), to murder Madame D’s butler, Serge X (Mathieu Amalric), inside of a confessional. An irony, to be sure, but one also not without its real-world parallels like everything else.
The rise of fascism in Germany and Italy is a seminal tragedy borne in the wake of another, but we shouldn’t ignore the power structures that refused to stand in their way. And while the already rich and powerful certainly have gotten their due blame, a key group that gets largely forgotten in their culpability is the Catholic Church. The Vatican, and Pope Pius XII specifically, was largely silent during the Holocaust despite numerous pleas for help. I’ve heard it argued that there was only so much the Church could have publicly done, but I must disagree. Behind the scenes, Pius himself sheltered a small number of Jews and privately urged a few of his closest officials to do the same. But publicly, he remained neutral and refused to condemn the actions of Nazi Germany. He was more afraid of retaliation than doing what was right, despite the fact that the largely Catholic continent routinely looked to him for guidance. By outwardly staying silent it gave license to the general public to do the same. He allowed the assassins into the monastery.
A common thread throughout Grand Budapest is how it was truly the common man who maintained and tried to protect the precious culture and history that those in charge seemed more than willing to dismiss and destroy. When Gustav decides to secret “Boy with Apple” out of Madame D’s estate before anybody can stop him it is with the help of the staff, including Serge X and the maid Clotilde (Léa Seydoux), that the painting makes its way to the safe in the hotel (though it is Clotilde’s betrayal and Serge’s false testimony that lead Dmitri to Gustav — collaborators came from everywhere). To break Gustav and his new compatriots out of the comically large prison, it takes cooperation and coordination from everyone around him, including a fellow prisoner not in on the escape keeping quiet out of solidarity. The tools used are snuck in via Mendl’s fantastic baked goods, made with love by his assistant and Zero’s soon-to-be wife Agatha (Saoirse Ronan), and even the prison guards are too enamored with the craft and design to risk ruining the beauty to check for contraband. What’s more, the concierges across Europe are banded together in a secret society to ensure that nothing is lost that shouldn’t be.
So, too, did normal people carry the burden of protection of people and culture from the Nazis as their scourge spread across Europe. It wasn’t the bourgeois who hid Jews or assisted the allies in their attacks on German soldiers in France, but the everyday working class and those in bureaucratic positions with the power to do more than their jobs required. There are famous names among them, such as Oskar Schindler who spent a fortune protecting 1,100 Jews, and Raoul Wallenberg who risked his life (and lost it) smuggling over 7,000 more out of Europe, but many of the righteous were unknown and overlooked. These were people who had little to gain and so much to lose, and yet felt the need to act anyway. In addition to the lives that were saved, there are numerous artifacts, religious and secular, that only exist today because of the kindness regular men and women showed, great works of art that only survived due to their help.
Gustav H, in many ways, represents all of them in one. He is shown to be a solitary man content to live, alone, in the confines of a small closet nestled within the grand hotel’s chambers. He reads his men poetry during dinner every night, despite them paying little to no attention while they stuff their faces with delicious food (that he, himself, will not be eating). He values the painting not because of what it can make him financially (although he does recognize the practical nature of doing so before anyone can steal it back), but because of the beauty it contains — the painting will one day find its home behind his desk in the hotel and seemingly stay there until the establishment is demolished. He is also a man who wishes to comport with the elite (much like Schindler did), using his position to attend to the wealthy clientele (particularly the women), but he never truly becomes them even when the secret will names him to be the inheritor of the entire Grand Budapest Hotel, which Madam D is revealed to be the silent owner of prior to her death.
Of course, his most selfless act is his protection of Zero from certain death. Zero is a refugee from a different war-torn nation, a young man without a home or family to return to. It is clear from their encounter with the ZZ in the barley field that he is considered an undesirable, but Gustav refuses to allow anything to happen to the boy. He can say all he wants that it’s because he doesn’t want to replace such a perfect lobby boy, but we know he cares for those who need protection by his actions. Despite not having much to pass on himself, he makes Zero his sole heir — a gesture that Zero takes to heart and never forgets. The two become inseparable, and Gustav’s desire to shelter him will unfortunately lead to his demise. Near the end, the two are once again accosted on a train passing through the same barley field. The faux principles espoused during the First World War have since given way to true hatred and violence. There is no protecting Zero anymore, and Gustav is shot unceremoniously.
“We have lost some enthusiasm, it is true. We don’t go now in rose-colored spectacles to exhibitions, but we haven’t forgot when we did so.”
In June of 1830, a now-unknown author published the above in the essay “A Gossip About Art and Artists”, the earliest known example of any variation of the term “Rose Colored Glasses”. It harkens back to a time when many would where spectacles not to aid their vision, but to instead recolor the world around them in hues of pink and rose, to better hide blemishes and mistakes. A combination of two older turns of phrase, the 1700s use of the term “rosy” to denote cheerfulness and optimism, and the older still use of spectacles to represent one’s ability to discern the world around them. By bringing the two together, the author recognized that we once used rose-colored glasses to pretend we could see the world better with a different perspective, turning nightmares into beauty. The actual practice may be gone, but the irony in their writing indicates that the practice has become metaphorical.
For a director as keenly aware of his production design, the colors used in any Wes Anderson film cannot be viewed as accidental. Across his filmography, there is a pattern — darker and richer colors are readily prevalent, particularly browns, greens, and blues. There are always flashes of yellow and the occasional deep red, but rarely anything that one could deem “rosy”. The contrast he creates with harsh colors used to populate the measured and meticulous diorama of set design allows for an obvious subtext that beneath the layers of control and order there is a darkness and uncertainty that plagues all of us. The Grand Budapest begins with these same color palettes, the only notable red being the carpet strewn over the hotel lobby in 1968. But when we move backward to Gustav’s era, nearly every aspect of the hotel is pink, rosy, and lovely. Even the uniforms of the hotel staff are royal purple. The only spot that is not resplendent with the blushing hues is Gustav’s room, which is instead drab and light brown.
Anderson is telling a story, through the eyes of an old man, of a time long past and one that he views with great affection. The story, far more than any Wes has told before or since, is incredibly dark and violent. We are seeing a world attempting to hold on to its history and culture while the forces gaining ground are doing everything they can to strip it away, and because of the framing device (and our knowledge of actual history), we know that one day, it will. It’s no surprise that from Zero’s perspective, the time of his greatest adventure, fraught though it may be, is colored as rosy as the most beautiful flower he’s ever seen. Zero loves the hotel, he loves Gustav, and he loves what Zubrowka once was to a young, scared, orphaned boy searching for a new life and new home.
Zero also loves Agatha, though it is clear early on that she will be tragically lost before the Author makes his visit. When her image is first shown, Zero refuses to even discuss her further — it is too painful. When he, finally, begins to elaborate on their courtship it is with a grand smile and flowing tears that he does so. In his telling, the lights of Zubrowka revolve around her wonderful visage, a halo around a woman taken far too soon. We, the listeners, are like the Author wondering what tragedy would befall her — we even briefly believe that Jopling took her life, leading to an upsetting sense of relief when it is revealed his victim was instead Serge’s sister (why should we care any less about her?). In the end, her death is even more unceremonious than Gustav’s will be just one scene later. After the adventure is over Gustav presides over Zero and Agatha’s wedding, though instead of joy we get the matter-of-fact tale of how she died within two years.
“The Prussian grippe. An absurd little disease,” Zero tells us. “Today, we treat it in a single week; but in those days, many millions died.”
Recognizing the danger of looking at the past through rose-colored glasses is just as important as remembering the beauty that we lost. If Anderson was somehow making the argument that the world was a better place before the war, he undercuts it so brilliantly in moments just like this. We may be living in a time when so much of what made the world worth living in is gone, but it is also true that we don’t have to worry about disease in the same way — the things that killed millions without fail are now as survivable as a cold to most of us with the proper treatment and care (something we’ve seen since in compressed real-time with the COVID pandemic). Wars are still taking place across the globe, but many of us are privileged enough to live in places where that is not currently the case.
The question remains why Zero has chosen to maintain the hotel even in its dilapidated state, and why he chooses to return to a place that brings him so much pain regularly. The Author surmises that it must be his way of remembering the world his mentor, Gustav, cherished, one of class and culture. Zero, instead, dismisses this.
“You see, we shared a vocation, it wouldn’t have been necessary. No, the hotel I keep for Agatha. We were happy here, for a little while.” As for the world Gustav cherished, he continues, “To be frank, I think his world vanished long before he ever entered it. But I will say, he certainly sustained the illusion with marvelous grace.”
The Grand Budapest Hotel is a movie in a fictional place but in a real time, one when Europe wanted to pretend that, despite the devastation of The Great War, the era of prestige and bourgeois charm of the late 1800s was still intact and not, in fact, a dead man walking. People like Gustav H. lovingly acted as caretakers both in an attempt to restore this perceived greatness but also to remember it, in case it ever truly was lost. Gustav’s legacy is not the hotel he oversaw nor the wealthy women he consorted with, but the memories and ideas that he passed onto Zero. The same is true of us — we are the caretakers of the best of our time and our world. It is our responsibility to pass what we cherish onto future generations. But, it is vital that we do not forget the challenges and the problems that we collectively endured as well. Recalling our era with rose-colored glasses will only make it harder for the future to maintain what it has, what it cherishes. Only once we can enjoy the great things we have and learn from the mistakes surrounding them can we truly be the concierges to the next generation.

“Where are you guys from?”
The young man’s face was pockmarked with acne. His sandy blonde hair was swept back and held in place with a generous amount of some pungent product. On his chest, a bullet dangled from a long silver chain.
“Canada.”
“Oh, Canada? You know who I love who is from Canada? Musician. I give you a clue. He’s been famous since he was a little guy.”
“Um… Justin Bieber?”
The man scowled.
“No, man! Not Justin Bieber! Drake, man! Not Justin Bieber!”
Budapest is a long way from Canada, almost a quarter of the way around the world from our Vancouver home. But somehow, wherever we went in the Hungarian capital, Canada kept coming up.
It was a long ride. The highway roughly followed the path of the Danube, and we were grateful for the air conditioning. When we finally stepped out into the city’s central bus station, the heat hit us like a wall.
Budapest has been around forever, even if the city was only officially formed in the 19th century. Like all of this…

I arrived in Budapest and was greeted by hugs and tears — some were my own and others were from my wife as she waited expectantly at the airport for me. Rachel and I have spent the first four months of our married life in the season of advent, marked by daily FaceTime video chats. For us, advent ended on December 22nd in Budapest Airport. We moved into the season of Marriage Together, finally.
In my couple weeks in Budapest, much of our time has been spent walking up and down Fillér Utca, the street that takes us up and down the enormous hill that we live on. In between treks up this hill we’ve celebrated Christmas, grocery shopped, watched movies, made lefse, gotten our hair cut, marched for peace, and learned to re-light the water heater in our apartment.
We have attended services at Budavári Evangélikus Templom, a Lutheran Church that is about a 25 minute walk from our apartment. This church is located inside the castle district of Buda. The church is a little bit off of the beaten path, but Rachel tells me that’s not uncommon for Lutheran churches in this area of the world.
Services last about 1.5 hours each, with sermons going about 30–45 minutes. The services have been in Hungarian, so it is quite hard to follow; however, one of the first songs we sang at the Christmas Eve service was “A Mighty Fortress is Our God” or “Erős Vár a mi Istenünk.” This phrase is an important one to Lutherans in Hungary, and it is traditionally said when shaking hands with the pastor after the service. Also, we found it quite amusing in the Christmas Eve service when the pastor giving the sermon swiped his iPad and a Star Wars image spoof appeared projected above him.
At another service, Bishop Dr. Tamás Fabiny, of the Northern Diocese of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Hungary, helped preside and give the sermon. Bishop Fabiny has been a strong Lutheran voice in Hungary about the church’s responsibility to help refugees. Rachel and Bishop Fabiny have already begun to work together on ways to further integrate the YAGM program with the Lutheran Church in Hungary.
In my mind, one of the most adventuresome things to do when experiencing a new country and culture is to get your haircut. To me, there’s a real vulnerability in trusting another person to shape part of your physical appearance — especially when you’re not able to communicate to them fully what it is you want done. Rachel and I both took the plunge one evening, and it turned out to be a fun experience. Plus, I think that our stylist did a nice job!
On New Years Day we were invited to an ecumenical peace march by Bishop Fabiny. Together with faith leaders from the Roman Catholic Church, Coptic Church, Scottish Presbyterian, and Lutheran Church we marched about 10 blocks to a Catholic Church near the city center. At the church, there was a brief service for peace, where prayers were recited and candles were lit for each country that is experiencing war within its geographical boundaries.
It’s wonderful to finally be with Rachel in Budapest, and begin to live into our lives together. We are so thankful to all the people that have supported us in the months and years leading up to now. We look forward to crossing paths again with those that have helped us get to this point, and we look forward to the trails that lead to new friendships and experiences in the future.

I am Portuguese but have been living in Budapest for 1.5 years. Unfortunately, now I am temporarily back to Portugal because of the virus. But can’t wait to go back to my beloved adopted city. It is the coolest city in Europe!! I’m glad you got the chance to visit and I’m happy to see you liked it! Hopefully you can go back one day :)

Groundhopping in Budapest: MTK Budapest — Hidegkuti Nandor Stadion,https://medium.com/@kevinmccluskie01/groundhopping-in-budapest-mtk-budapest-hidegkuti-nandor-stadion-b6ba9c3a95c,"Sign up

In a change of pace, this Groundhop adventure took me back to the Hidegkuti Nandor Stadion for the first time since September 2019 when I took in an NBII match between MTK Budapest and Nyiregyhaza Spartacus; a game most memorable for then Nyiregyhaza goalkeeper Jova Levente scoring from the penalty spot.
My return to the Hidegkuti Nandor Stadion after a two-year hiatus was not, however, to see MTK Budapest but instead to watch the Hungary v Scotland Women’s World Cup Qualifier.
Hidegkuti Nandor is a legend of the Hungarian game and famed member of the Arany Csapat who played for MTK Budapest, in their numerous guises, between 1946 and 1958. Hidegkuti is best known for his starring role in Hungary’s famous 6–3 victory over England at Wembley Stadium, where he scored a hat-trick; the game is immortalised in mural on Rumback Sebestyn U. in Budapest’s Jewish Quarter.
Hidegkuti was a talent ahead of his time helping to pioneer the deep lying forward role — a role that the likes of Denis Bergkamp would later find much success in — with his innovative and creative play helping him to over 260 career goals along with countless assists for his team-mates at both club and national level.
Upon his death in 2012 MTK Hungaria, as MTK were then known, renamed their stadium in honour of the club hero and when the original stadium was torn down and rebuilt in 2016 the new stadium maintained the name of Hidegkuti Nandor.
The stadium has a capacity of just over 5,300, however, it has one weird peculiarity about it — behind both goals are large concrete walls giving the stadium the air of a prison yard at times.
If truth be told, I had no idea that this game was even taking place until around midday on the day of the game when a message from a friend in New Zealand alerted me to the fixture. Despite the short notice, the evening’s plans were quickly changed to take in the rare occasion of a Scotland match.
For this one I would be joined by my wife — whose native Hungarian language skills would come in extremely handy — and our young daughter; I was on my best behaviour.
By error, which later turned out to be quite fortuitous, we arrived at the stadium about an hour and a half before kick-off; I hadn’t put two and two together that the kick-off time on the BBC Alba advert I’d been sent was the UK time and not the Budapest kick-off time. Sometimes I wonder about myself.
Arriving at the stadium to buy our tickets we noticed that the Penztar offices were shut. Step up my wife who found out from the security guards that we had to register and buy tickets on the MLSZ website. For those unaware, selecting your seats and purchasing tickets on the MLSZ website via mobile is possibly the most frustrating experience known to man.
After approximately 45 minutes of seats being added to the basket, dropping out the basket, and being re-added to the basket, we were finally able to purchase and download our matchday tickets for the reasonable price of 1,000 HUF each — circa £3.
Perhaps the takeaway lessons here are to make sure of the kick-off time and way to purchase tickets in advance of rocking up at the stadium.
Once in inside and pre-match refreshments purchased we made our way to our seats, my daughter enthralled by the floodlights and sight of girls out on the pitch where ‘men normally play’, and talking incessantly about everything she saw. It was great.
Anthem Time — The Hidegkuti Nandor fell silent for the National anthems. As Flower of Scotland echoed out over the tannoy system a lone Scottish voice, in amongst the couple of thousand Hungarians in attendance, began to belt out the Anthem with as much pride and gusto as he could manage; his daughter telling him with mild panic “Daddy, everyone’s looking at us”.
Yes, dear reader, that lone Scottish voice was mine.
From the off Scotland were dominant and maintained the upper hand for the majority of the game, the first in charge for new manager Pedro Martinez Losa.
After a bright opening, the breakthrough came in the 17th minute through Erin Cuthbert who scored from the rebound of her own missed penalty.
As the first half wore on complacency and slack passing crept into the Scottish game and Hungary began to grow in confidence but without really threatening Lee Alexander in the Scotland goal.
The second half picked up where the first ended with Scotland still the better side but prone to being their own worst enemy with some poor decision making at vital times giving Hungary hope of a way back into the game.
That all changed with the introductions of Lana Clelland and Martha Thomas just after the hour. The subs made an immediate impact with Clelland going close on a couple of occasions and causing the home defence problems before Thomas headed in a second for Scotland with a quarter of an hour to go.
Thomas’ goal effectively killed the game as a contest and, try as they did, Hungary failed to carve open the Scotland backline and find a route back into the game. In fact, it was Scotland who could and should have scored again with Claire Emslie missing a guilt edged chance towards the end.
It’s traditional in Hungary that the home side applaud the fans for coming out to see them, and at International level the men’s team are often serenaded by the Ultras giving a rousing post-match rendition of Himnusz, the Hungarian national anthem.
On Friday night, not only did the home players applaud the fans, but several of the Scotland team also came over to show appreciation of the (ahem) vocal minority of Scots in attendance. A small act that was greatly appreciated, especially by my daughter who had been blown away by the action on the pitch and the fact Scotland won, and hasn’t stopped about talking about the two players who ‘asked her’ for a picture; Lisa Robertson and Eartha Cummings, that small gesture meant the world to her (and me, if I’m being honest).
Next up for Scotland is a home game against the Faroe Islands on Tuesday — I’ll try to get the right kick-off time so I can tune in — and for Hungary, they host Spain, also on Tuesday and at the Hidegkuti Nandor Stadion.

I had done a fair amount of research on Budapest before I landed there, unlike my other random trip. This was a 13day long trip to East Europe and I had done all my bookings, research well in advance. I also got lucky with Budapest because a friends friend had lived there for three years and was immensely helpful in guiding me about the place and telling me about things I cannot miss in Budapest.
I have five days in Budapest and had fair amount of time to hand to cover all the things this friend had mentioned about in leisure. And trust me it wasn’t a point A to Point B, cover all the tourist points kind of a plan. She and I had common interests and she guided me on things that I would enjoy the most. Old and rustic pubs with live music for instance, a spa is always what I love to indulge in, you could call it a festish if you like.
There are so many experiences from Budapest that I would like to share about but what always stands out for me is something that changes something inside me. It could be anything from a conversation with a fellow traveller to an authentic meal. In Budapest it had to be the thermal bath experience.
I was told there are natural thermal baths and spas across the city and one can literally spend the day in one of those. Based on my friends recommendation, I decided to go to the one of the most popular one. While this is an experience I was waiting for, there was a lot running in my mind. I had asked none of them to my friend and the internet gave adequate information but for some reason I wasn’t trusting everything. As Indian’s we are not so familiar with public bath’s unless you are taking a dip in the holy rivers with all your clothes on. I had things running in my head and what did I have to shed to enjoy the experience fully?
Fortunately or unfortunately for me I just had to shed my inhibitions and walk into this beautiful place equipped with my swim suit. I got to Szechenyi Baths around three in the afternoon, it was fairly crowded and there was a small queue in front of the ticket counter and I was fourth or fifth in line, waiting to get my ticket and brimming with anticipation. When I got to the counter there was a man behind the counter and I asked if I could get a ticket for couple of hours, he answered politely and said the passes are for full day and I could use any of the baths I like. Now that is again something I discovered, I assumed there was only one large thermal bath. And I had not carried my own towel or flip flops so I could rent them at the counter as well and they would return the money on your way out when you return the towel and flip flop back.
Then I walked down to a narrow corridor after my tickets was punched to the women’s changing room and to get myself a locker. The fear of being nude in a public place is something I was not sure of and I was grateful that I could be in my swim suit. I mostly saw couples coming together or families or group of friends, I do not remember seeing another single traveller looking around lost and thrilled as I was.
As I made my way up to the baths finally I was freezing in my swimsuit, the temperature must have been around 8 degrees or lesser but the breeze was cold. In from of me were these three huge bath areas where filled with people, I could hardly wait to jump in, there were lockers by the pool side for people to keep their valuables and phones. I could not miss taking a few selfies and then locked my phone safely and left the towel at one of the chairs and walked right into the water. Oh man, so warm and relaxing, it was a bit too crowded for my liking by I found my spot and just chilled there soaking in the water for sometime before looking around and figuring what next. then I saw a fun whirlpool in the middle. I saw groups of people losing control and getting dragged into the whirlpool and having a lot of fun but again my minds talk started to converse. Everyone you see there are either couples or families or groups of friends having a blast, what would you to there alone. I though for a couple of minutes, wished I had my friends along but jumped right in. Let nothing stop you from living your life to the fullest a voice said inside me, I assumed it to be my mum.
Then it was time to experience the other pools and check the temperature difference and just experience everything that there was to experience. There was close to 12 smaller pools, which were indoor, less crowded and each one had different temperature and were in different sizes. Though I must admit that the vibe outdoors was way better. I believe there are all nigh parties that happens in these baths but I am not an all night party person at all, so that idea was not too exciting for me.
I had spent over three hours jumping from one pool to the other and now was starting to feel a bit tired and hungry. So, I bid farewell to the water and got straight into the shower and changing room. I would highly recommend the thermal baths in Budapest. But do not go there in a rush go post lunch and spend at least 3 hours. I would surely travel back to Budapest and dip in the water shedding a few more inhibitions and doubts of the mind. But till then the memories stays alive within.
Tips:
Highly recommend the full day pass at Szechenyi Thermal bath.
The ticket cost is about 22 Euros.
Carry you own towel and flip flops.
Spend 3 to 4 hours at least.

In this exercise I will try to recommend players for MTK Budapest. To suggest specific players we have to create player profiles. These profiles are important because every football club (like regular businesses) wants to maximize their return on investment. In sports, return is not only measured financially. Sporting results are usually higher in the hierarchy of the football clubs’ goals. To create player profiles we must know the tasks that the players are instructed to do. The closer the specific player’s profile is to the desired profile (usually called fit), the better the system works. These instructions are based on the coaching philosophy. Coaching philosophy obviously should be clear for every decision maker at the club. Coaching philosophy and club philosophy should also match, because both parties work for the same goal. Another important aspect is club identity and tradition, which is based on club history, club community and other environmental factors. If these 3 factors are synchronized (coaching philosophy, club philosophy, club identity and tradition) then it is easy to document tasks and therefore create player profiles. After this non-club specific entry let’s get into it.
MTK Budapest is undeniably one of the most important clubs (not only football) in Hungary. They won the second most (23x) Hungarian championships, which is quite impressive. But their effect on Hungarian football is even more impressive than that. To shorten your reading experience I will list some of the most important words that come to my mind about MTK Budapest. Tradition, culture, openness, innovation, talent management, intellectuality, community. These values could be easily seen on the pitch. MTK’s traditional football is arguably the blueprint for modern teams. High possession, lots of short passes, patience and near perfect organization. This should be the starting point of every decision at the club.
The club has one of the best youth system installed in Hungary. They founded the first football academy in Hungary in 2001. It is a key point in MTK’s current strategy to promote youth players to the first team, therefore it is crucial to have succession planning in mind when we try to recruit players. Pathways for talented individuals to the first team should be clear. Although my recruitment model is able to value relevant youth players (U16 and older), for this exercise I am not gonna use it. Upon request I can value the youth players of MTK and set up 3–5 year succession planning.
Dávid Horváth is one of the most talented coaches in Hungarian football. It is rare that a 38-year old coach is given trust in the first division. Firstly let’s see how he describes his own philosophy:
“We want to dominate in ball possession, create big chances, we don’t want to win with only 1 goal scored in the long term.”
“ I’m trying to make my own way. I don’t want to name anyone, from every great coach I try to take those elements that I like. Our coaching courses have followed a lot of directions, that is undeniable, when I studied the German style was emphasized, which is great If take a look on world football, German managers dominate, actually Jürgen Klopp and Thomas Tuchel were the coaches in the FA cup final. But I look up to the Italian coaches as well, Carlo Ancelotti doing fantastic things leading Real Madrid. I read a lot, I try to follow the international trends. At the same time when I got here, I took a deep dive in the club history, I try to follow the traditions laid by Jimmy Hogan and Márton Bukovi. I know for a fact that the legendary manager, József Garami followed the Dutch school.”
“The high intensity football that we showed in the last 4 rounds…is my ideal football. I think with this we can follow the world trends.”
index.hu
“The kind of playing style I try to instill is dependent on the club I work for. MTK has the identity, the club philosophy, even the playing style, here you have to be an MTK-style coach, and that football is — high possession, modern game, creating quantitative and qualitative superiority mixed with enough flexibility — is close to my heart, It is not hard to adapt.”
bunteto.com
Let’see how Dávid Horváth performed and whether he could show his philosophy. He managed 26 games in NB2 in the 2022/23 season. A traditional way too evaluate managerial performance is to use the point per match metric. It is certainly a good starting point, but this metric does not account for two important aspects. Home field advantage and opponent strength. Luckily my model include both of these elements providing a clearer picture than the traditional PPM. Here is the output document.
Although he had great resources, he did not disappoint results wise. It is clear that it was a good decision to appoint him as a manager. Stylistically he followed the club identity and traditions. Low number of crosses in chance creation is pleasing to see if you are a decision maker at MTK.
The defensive side is not as steady as the offensive, but still good for a 86 score out of 100. Probably a bit more aggressive approach would benefit MTK Budapest as they let the opponent keep the ball for longer periods. This coaching profile is another great addition to the tradition and club philosophy to create player profiles. Now we know what we are looking for.
I’m not going to analyze every player one by one, because this piece would be waaaay too long. I don’t really know, which formation will be the primary option. Some say 3–5–2 will be the one, but I would go with the 3–4–3. Maximizing the potential of Mátyás Kovács should be a primary goal for this season. In my opinion 3–5–2 does not suit him. The depth chart is based on a 3–4–3, because I think they will change to that soon. But these are just numbers and there is more depth to formations than this format.
Obviously there is much more nuance to rating players then grouping them into 3 categories, but it gives us a starting point. It is very important to note that I categorized players based on how I imagine their role in a team in the 4th — 6th range, which is not an unrealistic expectation based on wage expenses.
Sorted positions are: GK, central CB, LCB, LWB, CM, LW, CF
Positions that may need upgrading: RCB, RWB, RW
In this position MTK Budapest has the numbers, but I’m not sure there is enough quality. Kaka Godwords has a lot to improve to even reach NB2 level. Bence Várkonyi had a loan spell last season, he played for Kozármisleny FC in the spring. He is an aggressive defender, who performs well in defensive duels and has the recovery pace to cover large areas. When Várkonyi played, the defense of Kozármisleny was much better. For me the problems are on the ball with him. He is not a great passer. He rarely attempts progressive or forward passes and does not really asks for the ball, which is weird for an MTK Budapest alumni. He is still a good player, but did not pop off the screen. That is why I consider him as a quality rotation option in NB1 or a good starter in NB2.
I thought about moving Gergő Kocsis into the starter quality, so he is definitely on the fringes for me. He had a great season in NB2, he is very good on the ball, aggressive in duels (bit too much) and a versatile player. The only “problem” I have with him, is that Kocsis is 29 years old and only once in his professional career edged the 50% mark. What does the 50% mark mean? It means that the player played in 50% or more of the available minutes. It is a good measure to decide who is a starter and who’s not. That is why I grouped him as a quality rotation piece.
Benedek Varju is another player, where I was unsure where to place him. He is 22 years old, but has over 100 matches for MTK Budapest. For me he is best suited to play in the RCB position in a 3-man defense. Last season he played the most minutes at the right-back position. He was aggressive and performed well in defensive duels. He is great in the air, compared to other fullbacks. He is good in build-up play, takes good care of the ball. His progressive play and chance creation is also great, but well below the elite level. The reason why I’m not sure he is a clear starter is that he is often caught out of position, he definitely has to improve this part of his game. According to transfermarkt his contract will expire in 2024, although I expect MTK to extend his contract (I would probably do it, too).
Viktor Gey like Varju, is also a player who can play as a full-back/wing-back and centre-back. He is a new arrival from Kisvárda. He reached 2000+ minutes in NB1 the last 3 seasons, but his impact score is only 10 out of 100 in my model, rating him well below league average. It is hard to project future impact, it is even more difficult when a player changes teams. But I would have gone with a different choice.
We’ve covered the current options, now it is time to describe what we need.
I think these characteristics are important to be a great RCB in Dávid Horváth’s system.
Felix Bacher is a versatile, 22-year old Austrian centre-back. He is comfortable in a 3-man defense, and in a 4-man defense too. Can be deployed as a central CB, a right-sided CB or as right-back. He has a good frame, fast enough, no problem with physical capabilities. Extremely comfortable with the ball. Teammates trust him. Progressive passes and progressive runs are both part of his game. He has to adopt his style to MTK. Pass selection must tilt towards safety a bit more. Although Bacher is 1,9 m tall, he is below average in the air, which is an issue. All in all, I rate Bacher very highly. He was part of the Austrian Bundesliga Team of The Year, which is very impressive from a 9th placed WSG Tirol team. He is definitely good enough to play for MTK Budapest and this is probably the last time, when he can be attainable.
Another interesting name is Saba Khvadagiani. He is 20 years old and plays for Dinamo Tbilisi. He is well suited to play in a 3-man defense. He is very aggressive, he likes to “chase” his man and step out of the defensive line frequently. He has the speed and agility to play in a high line. Khvadagiani is a ball-playing centre-back, an elite ball progressor using both carries and passes. He is used to high possession and highly efficient in build-up play. He already debuted in the Georgian National Team and his reputation is growing by the day. He is a Georgian champion, and has experience in European Qualifiers as well. I would highly recommend him for MTK Budapest.
I think both of these players would significantly raise the talent level at MTK and have high resale value potential in them.
We’ve already covered the two main options Viktor Gey and Varju Benedek I don’t think they are the best options to be starting wing-backs. Ádám Miknyóczki played wing-back last season, but he is definitely a winger. This position is surely one I would upgrade.
Some of the needed characteristics are obviously same as for the centre-backs, but there are some post-specific requirements too.
The first name is Erik Kusnyír, whose contract expires in the summer of 2024, according to transfermarkt.com. He is one of my favorite players in the Hungarian NB1. I expect him to debut in the Hungarian National Team soon.
Kusnyír would be a fantastic addition for MTK, he fits the profile needed and possess high quality. I would highly recommend him.
Another player, who could be an option is Dan Sirbu of FCV Farul Constanta. He was a regular player of the Romanian champions. Sirbu is a versatile player, who can play as a RB, RWB, DM and CB also.
Sirbu is definitely a more attacking-minded player, than Kusnyír. I don’t know if the Romanian could be an affordable option for MTK, I guess it depends on the contract situation. Personally I would pick Kusnyír, because he fits the profile better, and for now a better player.
This position has the depth, but may need 1 quality signing. As I mentioned this is Ádám Miknyóczky’s main position, but he could not establish himself in NB2, unlikely to see him succeed in NB1. A loan would be the best option for him personally. I thought Nikolas Spalek will be a bigger boom in NB2, but he barely edged the 200 minutes mark. Most likely to start is Zoltán Stieber. Stieber delivered great numbers, but my model did not like him in NB2, which is unlikely to change one division higher. He is still a very good offensive player, but his defensive contribution is not enough for this level. There is a player, who haven’t played a lot at RW last season, whom I would certainly try to instill into the team. His name is Ákos Zuigeber. The well-rounded attacker always had great potential (still do), but injuries slowed down his development. Last season he mostly played as a LW, but he can play across the front line.
My first option would be to move him to the right side. But if MTK wants to solve this problem with another choice, here is what I would do.
I expect the wing-backs to provide width → Inside forward type, attacks the box, scores goals
Patient build-up → Can create against set defenses
High-possession style → Has the opportunities to try and create, has self-confidence to express himself
Creation not reliant on crosses → Creative both as a passer and receiver
One player, who fits this profile is Balázs Vogyicska. NB1 teams should have been all over him considering his age and talent.
Vogyicska is the player of Ferencvárosi TC. I don’t think he will play for them this season. It would be a shame if he is loaned to Soroksár SC in NB2. I would definitely recommend him for MTK Budapest.
I think both Zuigeber and Vogyicska would be a very good option for MTK.
Let’s see how MTK Budapest looks after our attempt to strengthen the side.
This side has the defensive quality to achieve the expectations. My model estimates that there are only 2 players out of this 11, who has a negative impact on the defensive side.
The offensive quality is probably even more starring. With the same of players (2) who are below average on offense per my model. We have players, who are comfortable on the ball. Mátyás Kovács and Ákos Zuigeber are interchangable in the half spaces. Every player fits well in the system.
In my opinion we strengthened the squad of MTK Budapest significantly at least in theory. This team would be good enough to contend for European places in NB1. Most of the players have significant value and could enter the market after a successful season, which fits well into the philosophy of MTK.
In this exercise I used transfermarkt and wyscout data. To value the coach and players I used my own holistic model, which accounts for quality of teammates and strength of opponents. If you have any questions or suggestions or just want to talk about football please let me know.

I have stood on many parts of the banks of this great river and looked down the Danube. But none stays with me like this moment in Budapest.
We had finished our visit to Buda Castle and stopped for dinner by sunset on the banks of the Danube. We were beginning our walk back home because we wanted to cross the Danube under the stars. It did not disappoint us.
The Chain Bridge is beautiful at twilight. From the moment the sun transitions from harsh brightness to golden yellow, the Chain Bridge passes through many seasons. Each is different and lingers, even if it lasts only a few minutes.
But all this fades away before the night. As the lights go out one by one, the Chain Bridge is transformed into a magnificent apparition over the water. It sits like a tiara above the Danube.
It does not surprise me to remember that when it was inaugurated in 1848, it was hailed as a work of engineering and among the largest such bridges in the world. Today, the world may have raised other more complex structures, but anyone who walks…

I was quite worried about coming back to The Grand Budapest Hotel. I watched it in late 2014, around the time of its release, when I was first starting to take cinema more seriously. At the time, it completely alienated me. That being said, I would’ve been 12 then… not exactly in Anderson’s target (or even considered) audience.
I returned to the film in 2020, when I had to watch it for one of my first year classes at university. I… still didn’t like it, but at least it made me laugh a few times in the process.
Considering that I have, up to this point, enjoyed every Anderson film to a certain extent, I was curious to see if my opinion on The Grand Budapest Hotel might finally change, making a radical, gradual shift across nine years from frustration to love.
My opinion did not change, though.

I love Hungary. Budapest was my favorite city ever when I visited it in 2022, and the food, the people, everything was fantastic. Although I understand some of what Viktor Orban believes, I can't fathom why he is blocking Sweden from joining NATO.

I stepped forward and found myself surrounded by several men. Their faces were serious and their eyes were watching me with unshielded curiosity.
I generally thought my family was somehow odd. Every year, as a general rule, we left on a few most colorful getaways, abandoning the commonplace everyday practice of our regular routines. It wasn’t so much that we were rich or had some mysterious fortune buried; we just had a talent for tracking down the most dark and exciting objections. Yet, it was only after we visited Budapest that I started to think something was wrong.
The city was a mix of old-world appeal and dynamic innovation, its roads overflowing with history and culture. We showed up at our leased condo, a curious little spot settled among the cobblestone roads of Buda, ignoring the glory of the Danube Waterway. It was the ideal setting for one more of our yearly experiences.
The night after our appearance, I chose to investigate the city all alone, drawn by the persona of Budapest’s complex roads. As I wandered through the architecturally significant area of the Palace Slope, I coincidentally found a little bookshop. Charmed, I pushed open the creaky entryway and wound up encompassed by racks loaded up with dusty old books, maps, and blurred photos.
An old man standing behind the overloaded counter was looking at me through the thick lenses of his glasses. He appeared to be pretty much as old as the books he protected. “Searching for something particularly amazing, youthful one?” he scratched.
“Simply perusing”, I answered. “But, I’d be intrigued assuming you have some books about Budapest’s secret history.”
His eyes shimmered with a disrupting glimmer. “Oh, unlike the others. Most vacationers come here for knickknacks and keepsakes, however, you look for a real thing.”
I raised an eyebrow, inquisitive. “A real thing?”
The old man inclined nearer, his voice scarcely above a murmur. “Budapest holds privileged insights, my boy. Privileged insights that a few families have protected for ages.”
My heart animated as I paid attention to the elderly person’s secretive words. “What sort of mysteries?”
He looked around to make sure no other person was tuning in before proceeding, “Professional assassins, my dear. This city has been home to an old and mysterious guild of professional assassins for quite a long time.”
I was unable to accept what I was hearing. It must be a fanciful story turned by a whimsical elderly person. “Professional assassins? Here in Budapest? That is absurd.”
He reached under the counter and gave me a well-used calfskin-bound book. Its pages were yellowed with age, and its title was just “The Budapest Guild.” I flipped through the pages, my suspicion winding down with each word. I was so confused by the story that I didn’t realize that the book was written in Hungarian. And that I was reading it with no problem.
The book spoke about the Budapest Guild, whose roots extend back to the Middle Ages.
As per the book, individuals from the guild worked in the shadows, executing clandestine missions for strong and cryptic clients. They were experts in camouflage, penetration, and trickiness, leaving no hint of their presence. In any case, the most stunning disclosure was on the way — the organization was reputed to be comprised of select, honorable families who passed down their knowledge and skills from one generation to the next.
I got back to our condo, my psyche hustling about the Budapest Guild. I couldn’t resist the opportunity to contemplate whether my family was in some way or another associated with it. Their often getaways to intriguing areas unexpectedly took on a vile contort.
That evening, as we plunked down to supper sitting above the city’s gleaming lights, I wanted to concentrate on my family with freshly discovered doubt. Their chuckling appeared to be all in all too practiced, their discussions excessively enigmatic. Might it be said that they were simply unpredictable voyagers, or was there more to them than met the eye?
As I dove further into the privileged insights of Budapest, I understood that my mission for reality could uncover beyond anything I expected. I was going to find that some family getaways were destructive businesses and that the Budapest Guild’s shadowy association had ringlets that came farther than I at any point envisioned.
Amid the charming roads of Budapest, my journey for truth was slowly unfolding secret and interest. The finding of the Budapest Guild had shaken my entire life, and with days passing, I was getting more hungry to reveal the whole story. And my role in it. Luckily, the antiquated book was helpful in my quest. Its yellowed pages helped me to uncover the Guild’s main seat.
So one night, while my family ate in our leased loft, I got away to investigate the city’s privileged insights all alone. The moon hung low in the night sky, creating long shaded areas on the cobblestone roads of Buda. It was during these nighttime hours that Budapest uncovered its most profound secrets.
I meandered through the complex back streets of Palace Slope, my expectations becoming stronger with every step I took. As I wandered further into the evening, I coincidentally found a faintly lit back street that coaxed me forward.
It was in this dark back street that I experienced a gathering of shadowy figures, their countenances clouded by the shroud of haziness. My heart hustled as I understood they were talking in quiet tones, their words a melodic rhythm of the Hungarian language. I stood frozen, concealed in the shadows, and tuned in.
Suddenly, one voice transcended the others — a voice I knew quite well. It was my dad’s, his tone firm and commanding. He ordered me to come closer and join the group.
“Your opportunity has arrived,” he said. His words rang with seriousness. “It’s your time to become familiar with our inheritance.”
I stepped forward and found myself surrounded by several men. Their faces were serious and their eyes were watching me with unshielded curiosity.
“Welcome to the Guild young man”, one of them said. Later, I learned that he was the Grand Master of the Guild and Master of the school I was about to join.
My father came over, gave me a quick hug, and said: “Make our family proud.” After that, he turned and walked down the street. I watched him until he disappeared into the dark shadows.
Then I turned to my new teachers. They simply turned and stepped toward the dead end of the street. They stopped briefly, just long enough to open a door that had not been seen until then. I stepped through them without hesitation, into my new life.

Budapest has become one of the top tourist destinations in Europe, for a good reason. Often, we do not recognize the beauty of the place that we live in anymore. But Budapest is simply amazing, and there is no reason to argue about it. It is not a city to tick in one or two days. Here you can easily spend a week discovering something new. But as in every place, being a tourist or live and work somewhere are two different things. Read till the end of this article if you want to know more about the complex image and the less charming sides of Budapest as well.
After having been to several corners of Europe, I can say that Budapest is the most picturesque city at night when it is enveloped in lights. No, it is not Paris. Budapest is the city divided by the river Danube into two parts, Buda as Pest. Hence the name Budapest.
I can be bored of seeing Jungfrau in Switzerland, the picturesque villages of Austria, or the countless churches of Italy. Still, I cannot cross the river Danube without throwing an eye on the ensemble of stunning monuments (The Buda castle, The Fisherman’s Bastion, The Chain Bridge, the…

A travel essay about Budapest and London, written in Copenhagen, Frankfurt, and Zagreb. I think I need to grow some roots.
Onwards!👇
When I’d come back from London, last year, I was flooded with splendor and grandiosity, yes, but was also sticky with the smell of a city that was once a heart of an empire but isn’t quite any longer. This smell emanated from every statue, monument, and stolid building. It oozed from the English gardens, swelled and dissipated with the Thames, fluttered on the rooftops like drunken pigeons. Even the somber tolling of the Big Ben carried with it an obvious verdict — an end to an era. London is well on its way to becoming just another capital city, albeit with a few more trinkets to auction, and a rather nasty sting in the form of the Trident nuclear missiles.
Coming back from Budapest I am flooded with a similar feeling, although it is far more nuanced and light. Hungary was once a rather significant European power (at least until the arrival of Ottomans and the collapse of so much European hubris). It extended all the way to Dalmatia and Slavonia in Croatia, something that is still touted by the old coat of arms scattered throughout the city — on the faces of buildings, forts, and magnificent bridges.
The city itself is monumental and even monolithic. It boasts elaborate facades studded with gargoyles, satires, and that European animal rarer than the unicorn, leprechaun, and Baba Yaga together. I am talking, of course, about the common African lion which the Europeans have elevated above every other animal of much greater use, economy, and industry. The lion can roar, yes, but is otherwise rather lazy and disinterested in the plight of both lionkind and mankind. Which, come to think of it, does a decent job of summarizing royalty worldwide.
Fine then, let the lion stand.
Walking through the streets of Budapest one eventually emerges onto the Hero Square, or the Hungarian Parliament Building, or Istvan Basilica. These buildings, along with many others, impart one of the most salient impressions of the city.
Nothing is small.
The streets are long, straight, and immensely wide, even the side streets. There are no London back alleys in Budapest. Buildings don’t come in sizes smaller than big. Some, like the Hungarian Parliament Building or the Széchenyi Medicinal Bath, are so large that it is easy to feel lost while walking their perimeter, let alone wandering their innards. Then there’s the Buda Castle on the Castle Hill, Hungarian National Library, St. Stephen’s Basilica, and a myriad of edifices that all carry with them a particularly Hungarian flavor — the beauty of Budapest architecture is incredible, improbable even, and unapologetically big.
The city has, since the 20s, been called the City of Baths, owing to the many thermal springs that soak its foundation — there are at least 6 in Budapest proper, and over a thousand in the whole of Hungary. The country essentially consists of boiling water, a few layers of dirt, and a city thrown on top, here and there.
We soaked our bodies in the Szechenyi Baths along with a thousand other people, of all colors, from every corner of the world, even those that now mostly supply the nameless people on the Hungarian fenced borders, trusting in the healing properties of thermal springs that contained sulfites and smelled the part.
The Bath itself is enormous, covering more than 6000 square meters, and boasting both indoor and outdoor thermal pools of varying temperatures. The largest outdoor pool is a special experience, particularly in the winter, with 36-degree water in 2-degree weather. Needless to say, the scalp gets a little chilly. There I also noticed a pandemic of a disease whose symptoms terrorize attention, ruin sleep, and cause a strange craning of the neck. I’m talking, of course, of the infernal smartphone whose allure seems so immense that the bathers couldn’t seem to bear parting with them, even in the pool. This forced them to hold one hand outside the water in the cold air, somewhat like the hand waving of English royalty, that is to say, dumb and unnecessary.
Since my smartphone habits are less than exemplary, I write this with slight rudeness to my cheek.
The city is nestled in a valley of hills and offers both flat grounds to cycle on and slopes to climb. In Budapest, unlike Copenhagen where I live, one has a use for the Achilles heel.
On one of the days we set out to explore the Grand Market but by the time we managed to saunter toward it, it had closed, leaving us only with a sight of its iridescent roof tiles. These tiles, called the Zsolnay tiles, are one of the most memorable sights in Budapest if you’re into that kind of a thing, which you are probably not. Neither am I, but these tiles still persist in my memory for reasons that remain unaccounted for.
With the closed doors of the Grand Market behind us, we set off across the magnificent Szabadság Bridge that joins its brethren in spanning the wide, mighty, and lazy Danube River. Even though it flows through Croatia, I’d never seen the Danube before and it was a curious feeling to know that, only a three hour drive downstream, my father had grown up in the town of Borovo, fishing and splashing his way through a childhood so far removed from mine that it sometimes seems almost fantastical.
On the other side of the river stands yet another monumental building. This time it’s the Gellért Thermal Bath whose pools gaped empty that day like the hands of a beggar who once knew splendor.
The Gellért Baths squat in the shadow of Gellért Hill, which was named after Saint Gerard who was allegedly thrown down its slopes to meet a gruesome death. The crown jewel of the hilL is the Liberty Statue, erected by the Soviets as a token to themselves for the liberation of Hungary at the end of WWII. The inscription on the bottom originally read:
“To the memory of the liberating Soviet heroes erected by the grateful Hungarian people in 1945.”
After the overthrow of communism in Europe, the inscription was later changed to:
“To the memory of those all who sacrificed their lives for the independence, freedom, and prosperity of Hungary.”
I found it an interesting example of how history, once decided upon, can certainly be changed, and changed again if need be.
Be that as it may, hundreds of people milled about the Liberty Statue under an angry, frozen Sun — some examining the high walls above, some examining the city below, but most, as you can imagine, examining the smartphone in their hands.
Of our own conduct I will not say much, except that we’d opted to breathe in the hazy vista that blankets the horizon, entwining people, nature, and the city of Budapest into a memory of a few short days touched by the long thoughts of history.
Thank you for reading.

This is the story of one of the least appealing things I have ever eaten. And also, of friendship. But mostly it’s about the unappealing thing. Read at your own risk.
…
You’re still here? Alright… let’s do this.
The November rain in Budapest seems to stick in the air like an impenetrable damp fog. The buildings are grandiose but muted, the people walk with their heads down, not in a hurry, but simply uninterested in their surroundings. I’ve traveled here with Garrett, a dry humored Canadian who has just come aboard the kitchen at my job in Sweden. With a week off of work, we agree to try a short trip together.
We are on the edge of town, searching for a local’s restaurant that one of us saw on some travel TV program. We’ve ridden away from the water that cuts between Buda and Pest, past the ornate museums and old sandstone buildings, and beyond the golden roofs. We are in a residential neighborhood now, drab Eastern European blocks houses, Soviet in look and feel; the sky here seems even more grey than before, the colors of the painted buildings seem a touch more muted.
We find Pléhcsárda hidden behind another small shack of a restaurant. The whole operation looks like a trailer set up in a trailer park. The dining room is a single table set up in front of the ordering window, which looks like it was made of…

Back on the rails, listening to stories and walking the ragged end of Budapest’s nineth district. To reach a nearby built-up area rather than retrace my steps through a wasteland with the occasional industrial complex I had spent the morning exploring on foot, I must cross six railway tracks with no formal crossing point. I watch a woman navigate the rails from the other side of the tracks and ask her advice about gaps in the fence there between road and rail before stepping out. With some trepidation. It is just three months since I fell down a railway embankment outside of Sofia in Bulgaria breaking my ankle and putting my Belt-Road tour from Beijing to Europe on hold as I limped back to London on crutches.
In contrast to earlier sections of the Belt-Road’s Middle Passage, many rail tracks connect Sofia, the first stop in Europe with the rest of the continent. I settle on the route through Bucharest in Romania, skirting around Belgrade in Serbia where, as in Bucharest, stories of Chinese investments suggest built, financial and social landscapes reformatted. Leaving the ground for a moment and taking a more abstract view from above, these stories boil down to minimising regulations, short-circuiting tendering processes, riding rough shod over environmental regulations, confiscating land and poor compensation: all in the rush to begin construction. Beneath these stories are cash-strapped local economies, anxious politicians and local elites eager for Chinese finance and the profits they bring while local citizens pay off the loans through their taxes and watch the disappearance of public land. Budapest fits this description too. China’s direct investment in Hungary (2023) is more than US$8 billion, by far Europe’s biggest share.
Back on the ground, the wasteland I spent the morning exploring on the ragged edge of Budapest’s nineth district is the site of China’s first university in Europe; Fudan Hungary University announced to great fanfare by both governments in 2021. I walk towards it across three and four line highways, elevated routeways made for traffic not walking and dotted with corporate offices. The BYD offices sit here along with a string of high-end car dealerships and the ‘Dream Store’ that sells bathroom fittings. BYD — which stands for Build Your Dreams — is the Chinese electric car and world-leading battery manufacturer hedging its bets on sanctions against China by setting up factories inside the EU. So far it’s Hungarian operations only makes batteries, but car factories are planned and reported to be in construction in other parts of the country.
I walk past construction sites confirming the feeling that this is one of the city’s edges, a place where Budapest is still being built. One of these has blue shipping containers stacked and creatively repurposed as housing and bathrooms for construction workers. I wander around marvelling at the use of surplus Chinese containers — trade between the two countries is asymmetrical — until a man in a high vis jacket throws me out. Next I pass the stylish white tubular athletics stadium on the edge of the area where the university is supposed to be. I can see no university, no ground being prepared, no suggestion of construction, only a large tract of scrub land in autumnal browns and yellows and an impressive derelict building that is gently falling down in the distance.
Walking further I find the exact place where the university might be but isn’t. I only know this from the street names — Dali Lama, Uyghur Martyrs, Free Hong Kong and Bishop Xi Shinguang of China’s underground Catholic Church. Krisztiana Baranyi, mayor of the nineth district, renamed the streets on which the new university would sit so as to annoy the Chinese Government and discourage the university’s construction. Popular protests erupted in 2021. Building didn’t start then and the scheme didn’t deliver a completed campus by 2024 as reports claimed it would. Optimistic news reports and announcements from both the Chinese and the Hungarian side insist that there would be five to six thousand students enrolled in shiny new buildings and five hundred staff at this outpost of China’s top tier university system by 2024. Instead there is no university; only a piece of wasteland waiting for something to happen.
Local citizens protesting the scheme object to the appropriation of city land for the education of elite students. The Budapest branch of Shanghai’s top tier university intended to charge the sort of fees most Hungarian students couldn’t afford, making it a resource only for the wealthiest. City plans earlier earmarked this area as a ‘student city’ intending it to be used to build low cost rental accommodation for students and young academics. The estimated costs of building Fudan in Budapest is in the region of E1.5 billion — more than Hungary’s Higher Education operating budget for 2019 — to be financed by a loan from China repaid by Hungarian tax payers. A Chinese contractor mired in scandal — China State Construction Engineering Corporation — would build the university using Chinese labour and materials making it hard to see the benefit for local people. Perhaps most controversially of all, delivery of this project is the responsibility of a Board of Trustees, headed by the Minister of Culture. Although there is no university and no project to manage, the Board of Trustees is paid E1.5 million a year — to date E16 million — for maintenance and operating costs on non-existent buildings despite not even having an office nor producing any activity reports (Daily News Hungary 13 August 2023).
A source close to the mayor told me that the university project hasn’t gone away, but as the Hungarian Government runs out of money it has stopped or slowed a number of expensive Chinese investment projects including the Fudan campus. Another story was offered by a taxi driver taking me to Budapest Keleti station for my train to Germany and the last stop on my Belt-Road tour. He understood that the mayor had secured permission for the athletics stadium to be built in the nineth district if the university proposal was dropped. He says that while the university project isn’t a secret, ‘no one talks about it’, although Fudan University and other Chinese projects indicate radically different directions in Budapest’s future.
Bigger stories run along these rails through Hungary too. Orbán’s Fidesz Party is desperate to attract Chinese finance, even now signing deals for factories, security systems to ‘combat terrorism’ and new railway connections to Belgrade and Budapest airport. Media reports show that Orbán’s closest local allies if not Orbán himself benefit from Chinese contracts. But the biggest story of all is geopolitical. Among many rosy statements about Chinese-Hungarian cooperation and solidarity, Xi Jinping loudly proclaims that Hungary is in China’s inner ‘circle of friends’. By this he means those countries that do the most to support China’s efforts to counter US power and influence in the world. Hungary’s rail tracks are the front line in tilting the axis of global power in China’s direction: offer a new vision for how the world might work (Financial Times 11 May 2024). This makes the rails that run through Budapest and its non-existent university a very big deal indeed.

I visited Budapest in 1990 very soon after the fall of the Iron Curtain, when the first glimmers of open gay life were just starting to show — nervous glimmers indeed compared to the astounding turnout of an estimated 200,000 people at the LGBTQ+ Pride march in the Hungarian capital on the 28th June 2025, the march expanding from a previous peak of 35,000 people as people came together in defiance of a ban put on the assembly by the Prime Minister, Viktor Orban.
In 1990 the gays in Budapest were not visible. There was a bar or two in the fashionable city centre where Spartacus, the gay guide to the world that every gay traveler kept in their backpack in those days, said gays were welcome. They were in no way gay bars — and the only club in town was in a discrete backstreet location some distance from the centre, had no signage to indicate its presence — but once inside I found a fledgling gay scene taking its first, nervous, steps. People were shy and guarded, but the music was good and we danced. I remember meeting a Russian ballet dancer. That was it. Gays were definitely not in the news. The big story in Budapest at the time was the opening of their first MacDonalds.
28th June this year was the 56th anniversary of the start of the Stonewall Riots in New York, the moment that is regarded as the kicking off point for the Gay Pride movement that emerged in the 1970s. As a direct consequence of the Hungarian government’s vindictive attack on the LGBTQ+ community, the world now sees how far the Hungarian people have come in accepting their queer brothers, sisters and children — this anniversary year may stand out in history as something like Hungary’s own Stonewall moment.
But no riot in Budapest. Despite threats to use facial recognition software and fine attendees, in the end the government directed the police to not harass participants and although they also gave permission to right wing groups to stage counter protests, nothing of any significance emerged from that. Instead a massive parade celebrating love in all its forms with attendees from 40 countries, stretched through the city. The photos and videos are incredible.
The beauty, harmony, love, peacefulness and joy on display revealed how utterly phobic and toxic the homophobic attitude of the ruling party is. The official ban was justified on the grounds of Pride being a danger to children — which simply reveals the dark minds of those proposing the ban, who are actually projecting their own dark thoughts onto gay people when they see us as sexual deviants and predators. Pride is not about sex, it’s about freedom — and knowing that, many heterosexuals walked in the march too.
Hungary is not the only eastern European country in which right wing politicians are stoking public debate about gay and trans people to fire up their base and to distract from anti-democratic legislation which they are pushing through their parliaments. It’s happening in Slovenia too. And some might say there’s signs of the same in the UK.
Pride is a Freedom March.
A Protest. A Declaration of Power.
Pride is Love In Action.

A Peek Inside The House of Terror — One of Budapest’s Most Notorious and Frightening Museums,https://articlesbypauletteklein.medium.com/a-peek-inside-the-house-of-terror-one-of-budapests-most-notorious-and-frightening-museums-e0249b4156d8,"Sign up

The Terror Museum isn’t your run-of-the-mill macabre haunted house type museum meant to temporarily scare you like a Hollywood movie. Instead, the terrors that took place inside this building are real, carried out by two separate regimes spanning from World War II to the Soviet communist area by their secret police.
The Terror Museum is located on the beautiful Andrassy Utca, one of Budapest’s most elegant boulevards with lush shady trees, stately apartment buildings, and high-end designer boutiques. This upscale bustling area of Budapest also has a dark and storied past. Nestled among the buildings on this posh street is where visitors will find the museum, which is one of Budapest’s most notorious and frightening buildings.
As I approached the entrance to the museum, I was struck with a surreal sensation knowing that this beautiful building was once the headquarters to both the Hungarian Arrow Cross Party (Hungary’s Nazi Party) and AVO/AVH Communist Terrorist Organizations. The building, if not for the iron platform with the words “Terror” adorning its roof, was a beautiful example baroque architecture and the words did little to prepare me for the history of horror that awaited me just beyond the entrance doors.
Before entering the museum I took some time to admire a piece of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain Memorial, a chain sculpture reminding visitors of the city’s dark history during Soviet rule.
The ground floor of the museum consists of the lobby, cafe, cloakroom, restrooms, and ticket counter. After passing through the ticket admission turnstile, I entered a 3-story courtyard that houses a Soviet tank sitting in a reflection pool and a gallery that showcases a haunting display of hundreds of black and white photographs of Hungarians who were the victims of the communist terror organizations.
The museum’s tour began on the 3rd floor where a labyrinth of exhibits guided me through the history of the building’s infamous past; starting with the story of the rise of the Hungarian Nazis (The Arrow Cross Party), the end of the Nazi regime, rise of communism in Hungary, and the resistance. The displays are a fascinating look at how the atrocities of terror organizations impacted the lives of the citizens of Budapest.
After passing through the exhibits of the top floor, the tour descends down a spiral staircase to the 2nd floor. Here I had an opportunity to learn about the history of the AVO/AVH terror organizations and the practices of their secret police. The exhibits feature communist propaganda, the life of people living under communism, the offices of the Gabor Peter, the Head of the Hungarian Political Police, as well as other exhibits to help one understand the terrors the citizens faced during this bleak and dangerous time in history.
From the museum’s second floor, I entered the elevator where the tour’s darkest part was about to take place. Learning about the history of terrors that took place was truly tragic, but what was hidden below in the building’s basement was even more terrifyingly evil.
As I made my way through a through a maze of dungeonous prison cells, interrogation rooms complete with the original torture equipment, execution rooms, and the heart-wrenching Hall of Tears featuring lit crosses in remembrance of the victims whose lives ended here, I was left shaken. Imaging the terror the victims must have felt as they endured days spent subject to horrific torture and worse in these cold grey stone walls was a bit overwhelming, to say the least.
As I exited the tour and stepped back out into the bright daylight and onto Andrassy Utca, my mind was still trying to process the evil that humans can do to one another. It was one of the museums that I wished didn’t exist, but believe must be visited in order to understand that the dark times of history should never be repeated. It was a museum that I will never forget.
The Terror Haus is one of the most powerfully moving museums in Europe and one that needs to be on your Budapest itinerary. The museum is open Tuesday to Sunday, 10:00 am to 6:00 pm and is located at 60 Andrassy Boulevard.

Travelling and seeing as many places as I can is a passion. It has never been solely about showcasing pictures just for the sake of it. It’s always been about the culture, community, language of communication, behaviour of the people, the structures, monuments, the history behind it and more such. It’s about knowing and absorbing and sharing this knowledge through written work and of course images corresponding to them.
Two days spent in Budapest, the capital of Hungary 🇭🇺 was like having been there for a long time. The way we devoured the sights of this city divided in two parts by the Danube River was just nothing short of amazing. This is an enchanting city with a vintage feel. Though the whole of Europe has an old world charm, there are differences in the structures and monuments from city to city.
We left on a Sunday morning by train from Vienna to Budapest with our daughter and family. It took only a little more than two and a half hours. The train was super comfortable where we could play card games with our little grandson who was our chief entertainer. Once there we took local trams and trains, hopping in and out of them to get around. But it was mostly a walking tour with our 4 year old in tow. He had his scooter and stroller when he required them. In his name we took a few ice cream and snack breaks. It was 35 degrees in the scorching sun which we combated with water, hats and sunscreen, running to the shaded parts of the promenades whenever possible.
After checking in at the hotel in Pest, we headed to Vajdahunyad Castle. It is a grand castle which has parts of buildings from different time periods displaying varied architectural styles. Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque. Its facade looks like a fairy tale castle. It’s an amazing amalgamation with a vast garden around it. This castle with vibrant stain glass windows, houses a museum of the Hungarian life over the years. It features their farming culture, use of animals such as cattle and horses. All the floors are lined with portrayals of the village life. Our grandson had an exciting time in the castle museum looking and touching all the stuffed real looking animals. He could even milk a fake cow.
The garden at the castle is vast, well tended and lush.
There is a sinister looking statue of a hooded person in the courtyard. It reminded me of ‘He who must not be named’ or Lord Voldemort from Harry Potter. It is the statue of Anonymus, created by Miklós Ligeti. Anonymus was a 12th-century chronicler whose real name remains a mystery. He served as a notary to King. He inspired the Dracula stories in books and movies. On the outer wall of the castle, there’s also a bust of Béla Lugosi, the Hungarian-American actor who is renowned for his role as Count Dracula in the original 1931 film.
While coming out of the castle grounds, we saw a hot air balloon at a distance. Naturally we walked towards it to go up in the air on it. When we approached the ticket counter and enquired we were told the balloon will go up only at 6 pm. It was only noon time and it was impossible to come back for it. We all felt ‘deflated’ by it.
Budapest is made up of two formerly separate cities, Buda and Pest, which lie on opposite sides of the Danube River. The Chain Bridge, which we saw from a distance, completed in 1849, was the first to connect them. In 1873, the two cities were officially unified under the name Budapest. We remained in the Pest side as we didn’t have time to go to Buda. Perhaps when we come next, we can only cover Buda, which apparently is a classier and more residential part of the city.
In spite of the intense heat, we lingered at the banks of the Danube which reflected the blue of the sky with a few boats floating on it. We saw the majestic looking Parliament building, which is the largest building in Hungary. Built in 1904, it’s a gothic structure influenced by the City Hall in Vienna. It’s declared as a UNESCO Heritage site.
While searching online for places to visit, my daughter came across this powerful memorial. Lined along the riverbank are worn looking cast iron shoes, symbolizing the Jewish victims shot into the Danube during World War II. Seeing it deeply moved me, as it brought the horrors of that time to life. This was created by film director Can Togay and sculptor Gyula Pauer. It honours Jews killed by members of the Arrow Cross Party. Victims were forced to remove their shoes before being shot, their bodies falling into the river. The memorial marks the place where they stood ..only their shoes remained.
The one regret I have is not having been able to go across the famous Chain Bridge to Buda. I looked at it longingly, the beauty of it enhanced by the blue of the Danube. Designed by English engineer William Tierney Clark and built by Scottish engineer Adam Clark, it was the first bridge across the Danube in Hungary. It was opened in 1849.
We stayed in Pest as it’s the livelier side, full of attractions, and it’s where most tourists end up wanting to spend their time in Budapest. It was crowded in the popular squares of the area where we stopped in shaded cafes to have cool drinks. Great for people watching. The Intercity Hotel was very comfortable. We slept well out of sheer exhaustion that night and had a filling breakfast in the morning.
Next day we went in search of The Metropolitan Ervin Szabó Library in Budapest, famous for its vintage interiors. It is a sprawling public library complex, with its main structure in an ornate 19th-century former palace, built in neo baroque style. Unfortunately we could not go into the classical side because there was a film shooting going on. What a disappointment! We had to make do with wandering in the less interesting part where there was a modern lending library. We admired the facade and had lunch at a near by open restaurant with our little hero making up games and running all around. I had an interesting salad with sun-dried tomatoes, red lettuce and Hungarian cheese topped with blueberry marmalade.
We debated going to Buda for a quick visit but we were not sure whether we would get back to the train station in time for our return. We decided to go and see the largest synagogue in Europe which was a few minutes walk away. It is a magnificent structure built between 1854 and 1859. It has twin octagonal towers topped by onion domes which has an oriental touch. The Star of David is embossed into the stone tablets. There is alternating yellow and red brick work on the imposing building ..standing the test of time.
Again sadly we could not go in because it was time to get back to our hotel for our luggage and head to the station. But we were happy to view the awe inspiring facade.
Some of the underground metro stations take you back in time like the late 1800s or early 1900s because of its vintage feel. It is compact and quaint in its tiled look with wooden benches and frames. Took me back into another era. Loved the ageless feeling while waiting for train which itself looked as if it was from another time long past. I visualised suited, hatted gentlemen with their canes or hooked umbrellas and slender women in long frocks and fashionable hats of that time waiting at the station.
I forgot to mention the street book shop that we saw while walking towards the Ervin Sazbo Library. It was heartening to see the lovely colourful cart with hoards of books surrounded by eager buyers. Mostly Hungarian books, so we didn’t delve further. We also passed by a big well organised secondhand book store with books from floor to ceiling.
Though there were hardly any books in English, it was a sight to behold and to be photographed.
On Sunday after our sightseeing and long walks in the hot sun, we went for dinner in a restaurant where they served beverages on little trains. This place was chosen for the youngest and most important traveller in our group. We ordered Hungarian food and drinks. It was fascinating to see the drinks coming on mini trains. There were railway tracks on every table. There was live music by musicians who came from table to table. They played a Greek song for us at our request along with Hungarian and German. It was a unique experience.
On our return train, I dozed off almost half the way vaguely listening to the little fella’s chatter like a lullaby in the background. Felt good to be back to our present turf reminiscing about the two days well spent in Budapest, thanks to our daughter and son in law. A special thanks to the little one for entertaining us all through.

Budapest was such an awesome city! Although not at the very top, it comes a very close second! It is very open and spread out, yet it still had its nooks and crannies to get lost in. The city reminded us of Brooklyn in NY, it had a trendy/hipster feel with a lot of young people. The nightlife was outrageous, with tons of restaurants to eat at and bars to socialize in, for all sorts of tastes. There were parks to lay around in or many shopping streets to keep you busy. There is something for everyone in Budapest… except a beach which is why Barcelona is still our favorite city visited so far.
Budapest has 23 districts and they are usually indicated by Roman numerals. The more central districts, like downtown, have lower numbers while the outer districts have higher numbers. The best districts to stay in are district V and VI as within these 2 districts you can find a lot of the major landmarks & attractions, along with the widest selection of restaurants, cafes, pubs and bars. Most, if not all, are walkable. We barely used the Metro system but it was very easy to navigate when necessary.
There were countless accommodation options in Budapest especially a huge range of hostels. Booking the day before still allowed us over 40+ hostels to choose from. We ended up staying at 11th Hour Hostel and Cinema which was located right in the middle of downtown. Some other popular hostels in a great location are Wombats, Big Fish, Downtown Oasis, Maverick City Lodge.
Szechenyi Baths and Pool — One of the largest spa complexes of its kind in Europe. The entry ticket is (5000 HUF/ 16 €) which includes the usage of a change room, locker, multiple different pools, saunas, steam rooms and fitness centre. We spent a couple of hours here relaxing in the pools & sweating it up in the saunas. Note: bring your own towel & lunch as there isn’t a large selection of food!
Conquer Budapest Walking tour visiting St Stephen Basilica, Matthias Church, Danube Promenade, Chain Bridge, National Opera House, Castle District (Royal Palace, Matthias Church, Fisherman Bastion). Our guide for this was one of our favourites of our Europe trip so far and we’ve done a lot of ‘free walking tours’. The tour was never boring even though we are slowly but surely getting tired of churches and history, he kept it interesting and fun for the whole 3 hours. The Fisherman Bastion is shown below.
Central Market Hall- A 3 story hall combing shopping and eating. Fresh fruit and vegetable stalls, meats, cheeses, souvenirs, shopping and most importantly a selection of food stalls with portions bigger than you can ever imagine. Classic Hungarian dishes are sold here but come hungry and forget trying to count calories.
Vaci Utca — Vaci Utca is one of the main shopping streets in Budapest and also a very popular tourist drag. The street is lined with cute cafes, great shops and a tonne of Thai massage parlours which we indulged in (do shop around).
Margaret Island — A 2.5km long central island laying in between “buda” and “pest”. A very well kept island with ample to do during the summer months. It’s a beautiful spot to spend an afternoon during the spring/summer. The island has a pool, water park, wildlife park & athletic centre. We strolled here from downtown Budapest or you can take the number 26 bus which is the only vehicle allowed on the island.
Gellert Hill — Panoramic views over Budapest. You can climb the Gellért Hill starting at the Elisabeth Bridge near the Gellért Monument, or you can take the steeper route starting at the Gellért Hotel. You can also take a bus or get there by taxi.
Eating in Budapest was a welcomed treat after indulging in so much pasta and pizza in Italy. Hungary had their typical cuisine but also every other type, so there was never too much repeating. It was cheap, the portions were often of a good size and there were countless restaurants to choose from.
Street food is also very common and convenient in Budapest. At Karavan you can find numerous food trucks in this little outdoor area. Perfect for a quick dinner or a late night snack after spending time at the famous ruin bar, Szimpla Kert.
Below is a list of the typical Hungarian dishes you should try if you are to visit the city! And before you finish, don’t be alarmed when we mention that we did eat all of them.. a few times.
You can easily sample all of these on your own throughout the city but if you enjoy food tours then we suggest signing up for one of the many tours Taste Hungary has to offer.
Hungarians typically eat their biggest meal during lunch so many restaurants offer a “Tourist Menu” which involves a three-course meal for less than $6 (100 HUF), this is often cheaper than ordering just one dish. However, when we weren’t eating a 3-course meal, you could find us at some of our other favourite restaurants:
Bors Gasztrobar — Always a line, freshly made baguette sandwiches, homemade soups & cheap cheap!Drum Cafe — Cheap, classic Hungarian food.Fruccola — Healthy, fresh, create your own salads/sandwiches.Magyar — Classic 3 course restaurant with generous portions. Close to the Grand Central Market but surprisingly not a tourist trap as we had first thought.
Just like restaurants, the nightlife options are endless and generally are within walking distance. We weren’t in Budapest over the weekend but each night had something going on.
Some of you may be aware of what a “Ruin Bar” is, some not… well Budapest is famous for these types of bars. It is simply a bar/pub, inside or next to an old building. The buildings have usually been abandoned and turned into bars by decorating them with many different types of objects, such as paper statues, foreign licence plates, unique lanterns and seats made from cushions, old cars, duck tape, you name it. If you use your imagination you can usually get a picture for what they look like. None of the interior makes sense and generally doesn’t have a theme except looking like ‘designed junk’. If the walls aren’t covered with pictures and objects then they are painted.
Some of the most popular Ruin bars in Budapest are Szimpla Kert, Grandio, Instant, Yellow Zebra Bikes & Bar and Anker’T. If you have to go to only one, make it Szimpla Kert! So much fun and so unique. It’s open during the day, so you can get a better look at the interior. Grandio is a hostel as well as a bar so don’t stay here if you’re wanting to sleep!
Gozsdu Courtyard is another popular area in downtown. Although they aren’t ruin bars, the courtyard/long street has a variety of beer gardens and restaurants and is both popular with locals and tourists. Check out Spiler, one of the biggest restaurants in the area with a solid menu both for food and drinks. The lamb burger was super tasty & recommended.
We were really sad to leave Budapest but until next time…..

Budapest is renown for its spas — even the zoo has one, with many animals having their own thermal baths (and, apparently, a very high reproductive rate). On a glorious spring day I stood outside the belle epoch Széchenyi Baths, the phrases ‘taking the waters’ and ‘frequented by royalty’ running through my mind. Even the entrance to the baths was a work of wonder.
Inside was all high ceilings and chandeliers. An authoritarian attendant ushered me into a small change room, returning later to lock my clothes away. I shared my change room with half a dozen others — this was no place for false modesty.
And so, to the waters. Outside were two enormous baths (one at 30 degrees C, the other at 34) with a lap pool between them. Inside were another 15 or so baths, each catering to different needs.

Our complete running guide to Budapest is now on the Great Runs site. Below is a quick summary.
Budapest, Hungary is a wonderful city for traveling, with wonderfully preserved architecture, great restaurants and bars, and a good transport infrastructure. It is the capital of Hungary and the country’s largest city, with a population of 3.3 million. There are lots of great places to go running in Budapest.
The best places to run in Budapest are all centrally located. The highlight is Margaret Island, a recreational mecca with several km of trails with great river and city views. There is also excellent running along the Danube, on both sides, although one should look carefully at our guide to learn the best sections. There are also some great parks for running: City Park (Varosliget), Bikás Park, and Orczy Park. And for some hills, head to Gellért Hill in Buda and run up to the Citudella (fort), or enjoy the more expansive Normafa park, a few km west of the city. One thing that’s unique about running in Budapest is that there are many places with rubberized running tracks, which are dedicated paths for runners. The longest is 5.3 km on Margaret Island. Many of these tracks also feature an open air fitness park, with machines for exercising.
Our full guide to running in Budapest is on the Great Runs site. Click on the links to each of these routes for full description and maps.

December 29, 2024
When you first step into a new city, the vibe tells you a lot. Specially, when you go in without much research, like we did for this one. So, stepping into Budapest after the loud and lively Vienna felt like entering a quieter, more mysterious world. As we climbed up the escalator from the train station, the crisp cold air hit our faces, and the glowing Liberty Bridge appeared in the distance arching over Danube. It was a quiet welcome, and something about it felt right. Calm and inviting — that was our first taste of Budapest.
The walk to our hotel was an easy 10 minutes. Although, in -2°C, dragging suitcases, while our fingers and nose slowly froze, we couldn’t help but admire the streets. That moment, in a way, set the tone for the rest of the trip: embracing the unexpected and finding joy in the little things. My North Face jacket and Alaska-grade boots were doing their job, but Dev, who’s always “too cool for layers,” was clearly questioning his decisions. The streets were quiet, dimly lit, and peaceful — a stark contrast to where we had come from. Tired but content, something about the city felt quietly intriguing.
December 30, 2024
Day 1: When Things Don’t Go as Planned
The next morning, we woke up later than usual. Laundry was the first task of the day — a necessity for anyone packing light on long trips. We tried this for the first time last year during our trip to France and Spain, and it was a game changer. We found a laundromat nearby and got our oat milk lattes while waiting for the cycles to finish. It was a slow start, but it felt good to take our time. Given our type A personalities of always being on the go — Dev, especially — and me being a mix of high-energy and sometimes slowing down, we’ve both been trying to deliberately pace ourselves. This trip somehow made it easier, as if the city’s vibe gently nudged us to slow down and be present. It even tied into my New Year’s resolution. How? I am not going to spoil it for you! You’ll find out towards the end.
Then came breakfast — or rather, the search for it. Most places were closed for the holidays, and Google’s “open now” wasn’t exactly reliable. Isn’t it funny how we still trust Google blindly, even after so many travel time fails? No? Just us? Anyway, we ended up wandering aimlessly for what felt like forever, hangry. Finally, we stumbled upon Napfényes Restaurant and Confectionery, a vegan Hungarian spot. We had vegan versions of authentic Hungarian food, including vegan goulash. The desserts were the real winners: a sponge cake that reminded me of tiramisu and soy yogurt “cottage cheese” balls. We devoured it! When sharing dessert somehow we eat faster! No? Again, Just us?! 😲
We enjoyed a long brunch and by the time we were done it was already noon, so with no specific plans for the day, we decided to just walk along the Danube. The river stretched out, with the Buda Castle standing tall in the backdrop— it was mesmerizing.
While I posed at multiple locations by the river and Dev happily played photographer, a guy proposed to his girlfriend right next to us. I was so in the moment that I missed their moment and realized it when I saw people congratulating them. (You’ll see the exact moment I finally saw it in the picture below) I was so bummed that I missed it, but it also made us feel so warm and happy to see the happy couple! Also, I didn’t forget the usual:
Me: “You never proposed to me like that.”
Dev: “I’ve been on my knees ever since.”
Dude’s got lines!
The foggy walk along the river was really romantic, which explains the proposal as well. It’s an amazing spot to propose — if that’s something you’re considering. Notice the bench, that’s where you can pretend to take a picture from behind while the other person faces the river. Perfect moment to get on your knees. Good luck!
I took this picture of Dev on that same spot before the proposal happened.
As we moved along, we saw a street vendor mulling wine on the side of the road. Unlike the machine-made ones in Vienna, this one was simmering on a stove. We grabbed some, and Dev downed his so fast he claimed, “Fefde jal gaye” (burnt my insides). But it warmed us up perfectly for the evening.
Continuing our walk, we came across the Jewish Memorial — iron shoes lined up along the riverbank. These shoes commemorate the Jews tragically executed during World War II at this very spot. It’s a haunting and humbling reminder of history’s darker moments.
Hungarian Parliament
From there, we turned right and saw it — the Hungarian Parliament — a jaw-dropping masterpiece of architecture. It’s one of the most stunning buildings we’ve ever seen! I had heard it’s even better from the inside, but we didn’t have tickets, and it was sold out due to holidays on that day. So we happily admired the exteriors of this exquisite detailed gothic and renaissance gem! Of course, this meant photos galore. Dev quipped, “Seriously, itni photos li hain ki Parliament Sharma gaya!” (We clicked so many pictures that the Parliament itself got shy!)
After all that, we decided to take a coffee break but we realized we were completely coffee-d out! So, I ordered water — because, fun fact, Europe and dehydration seem to go hand in hand for me. Unless I’m super intentional about drinking water, I always end up forgetting to hydrate. Quick tip: Make sure you sip a lot of water while traveling! Over Dev’s chai latte with oat milk, water, some vegan Lindt chocolate, and some more geeking out over architecture history, we enjoyed the lit up view of the parliament. Dev after over 10 years of being married to an architect is pretty caught up with his architectural history!
Honestly, these little pauses are becoming some of our favorite moments. ❤️
Evening Adventures: Ruin Bars and New Friends
After that, wondering what to do next, we decided to explore a street nearby called Andrassy Ut. After walking that street, we found a small vegan restaurant tucked in a basement. At first glance, we were hesitant, but the cozy, homely vibe inside won us over. The place was run by a mother-daughter duo, with the mother cooking in an open kitchen and the daughter managing everything else. I tried vegan cottage cheese pasta, while Dev had a burger. They were out of their vegan Hungarian goulash, much to my disappointment. After enjoying our meal, we left chatting and laughing, only to realize ten minutes later that our handbag was missing! Dev sprinted back to the restaurant and thankfully , we retrieved it without issue and after some deliberation decided to head to the Jewish Ruin Bars, a must-visit in Budapest. These bars, created in abandoned Jewish factories post-World War II, are now vibrant spots of nightlife. There, we ran into an Indian couple living in the UK and had such a great time talking that we completely lost track of time. By 11 PM — a late night for us — we realized how much fun we’d had and how unexpectedly we ended up celebrating what felt like an early New Year’s Eve with newfound friends. Moments like these truly make travel special!
December 31, 2024
Day 2: Lost and Found on Gellért Hill
We started our day nice and slow, waking up around 10 AM. After getting ready, we headed to Buda for the first time, curious to see what it was all about. Our main stop? The St. Gerard Sagredo Statue on Gellért Hill. Now, this place has quite a story — turns out St. Gerard was a priest who was thrown off the hill for his beliefs. Pretty tragic, but hey, now he’s got this massive statue and a hill named after him. Goes to show, if you stay true to yourself, you can leave a lasting mark on the world. The views from up there? Totally worth the climb. The winding roads to get there — foggy and lined with leafless dark trees — felt straight out of a movie.
From the statue, I got it into my head that we needed to explore more of the hill. I wanted to see the Liberty Statue, Hungary’s version of the Statue of Liberty, perched somewhere higher up in the mountain. So, off we went, walking past fancy mansions and more winding roads. We somehow found ourselves passing the Saudi Arabia Embassy and even saw a mansion that had once belonged to a wealthy family but was sold due to tragedy and is now a museum, I think. It felt like a little adventure in our quest to find the Liberty Statue. Maybe it was the fog, or maybe it was the construction happening around the castle at the top, but we didn’t find the statue.
Eventually, what we did find, was a cozy café called Füge Shop and Café. We sat down, sipped hot coffee, and just chilled for a bit!
As the evening rolled in, we crossed the bridge from Buda back to Pest for our boat tour on the Danube. If you want to see Budapest in all its glory, this is the way to do it. The Parliament and Buda Castle lit up at night? Stunning. If I may get poetic — the Parliament glowed like a golden crown against the night sky, its reflection shimmering in the Danube — a sight to remember. Nothing could stop us from stepping out of the heated seating area onto the deck for better views, and wow, it was worth it. A flock of shadowy black birds danced against the Parliament’s glowing backdrop, the chill of the air felt nice, and the Danube looked majestic as ever. It was one of those quiet, perfect moments for Dev and me, just soaking it all in. Oh, and let’s not forget the Spanish group of revelers who at that moment asked me to take their group shot. I obliged, and my iPhone .5 shot skills made them so happy! It was all happening.
After the hour-long tour, we walked back to our hotel for a quiet New Year’s Eve. Leftovers, packaged dal from Costco (warmed up by the hotel staff, pro move, right? Which the hotel manager noticed and told us, Hungarian tradition says if you eat lentils on new years eve you will have immense wealth the next year, well, we’ll take that!) some snacks, a complimentary bottle of wine from the hotel, video calls with family, some Bollywood party music, a little dancing, and just enjoying each other’s company.
New Years Day — Jan 01, 2025
Day 3: Vampires, Witches, and Spooky Stories
Waking up on the first of January, the first thing that popped into my head was my New Year’s resolution: spend less time on social media. Over the past year, I’d realized I’d developed a bit of an addiction to scrolling. Sure, I love sharing travel pictures for many reasons, but it started to feel counterproductive. (We’ll save that discussion for another day!) So, before I slept on New Year’s Eve, I boldly deleted my Instagram app.
Fast forward to the next morning — I woke up feeling good but immediately wanted to reinstall the app. Classic, right? But guess what? The universe was on my side because I couldn’t log back in! Logging in from Budapest locked me out, and I didn’t remember my password. Taking this as a sign from the stars, I decided to roll with it.
I shared this with Dev over breakfast, and he confessed he could also do with less Reddit and LinkedIn time. Boom — joint New Year’s resolution made! Feeling all kinds of inspired, we got ready and stepped out into a cloudy, rainy Budapest winter.
Eating out on New Year’s Day is tricky. Most places are closed, and the ones that are open are usually packed. Our first stop was a café, but the only vegan option was, literally, a freezing spirulina beach bowl. So we moved on. Eventually, we stumbled upon a fancy Michelin-starred restaurant. It wasn’t entirely vegan, but hey, it sounded like a New Year’s treat. And it was super fancy — the server unfolded my napkin and placed it on my lap. Not the most comfortable I’ve been in a moment!
I ordered a delicious spinach salad with tofu, while Dev went for an acai bowl and fries (the only other vegan options). Oh, and the breads were vegan and delicious. The food was top-notch, and we felt fancy AF starting our year like this. Again, not planned at all!
Next up was Buda Castle, sitting pretty on a hill. Armed with layers of clothing and our enthusiasm, we started the climb — stairs and all. The view from the top was stunning, but man, it was freezing!
Once we reached the castle, we saw massive lines for the museum and ticket counters. After a quick debate, we decided to skip the museum. Why? Because we wanted to be more intentional with our time. Instead of rushing through, we chose to go back to our hotel, relax, and recharge for our evening plans. So unlike us, right? I think it’s all about fighting the FOMO!
Back at the hotel, we couldn’t distract ourselves with our phones (thanks to the new resolution), so we turned on the TV. To our delight, there was an orchestra performance playing — it felt oddly perfect for the day. We snacked on leftovers, took a quick nap, and felt recharged for the evening.
Our evening began with street food (yes, pav bhaji in Budapest!) before heading out for our walking tour. We took a quick stroll around the winter market and the giant Ferris wheel, which had completely baffled me earlier. The blue glow it cast on the sky behind the buildings had left me wondering where it was coming from — until I finally saw the Ferris wheel and it all made sense.
Eastern Europe has a rich history of eerie tales, and this walking tour was a deep dive into them. We learned about Vlad the Impaler, the Romanian ruler who gruesomely killed his enemies. Vlad was later captured by a Hungarian emperor and imprisoned under Buda Castle. This gruesome history inspired the vampire legends we know today, including Dracula!
The craziest part? As our tour guide was dramatically recounting this story, a bystander — Romanian, of course — who was not at all happy about the story, interrupted to say Vlad wasn’t that bad. Who’s to say? Maybe we’ll have to visit Romania to find out. New trip idea alert?
Then there was the story of the Crying Widow, a woman who allegedly ran a hospital in her basement but used the blood of young girls to maintain her beauty. Oh, and another witch apparently ate children straight out of their graves. 😱. By the end of the tour, we were thoroughly spooked — especially since we had to walk down the castle hill alone.
We grabbed a cab back to the hotel that was 5 minute drive away. Not because it was late at night and we were spooked, duh!, only because we had an early start the next day. 😅
That night, we packed up and got ready for our early morning train to Bratislava.
Final Thoughts
Budapest wasn’t what we expected, because we didn’t really know what to expect. It was better. From wandering aimlessly to stumbling upon cozy cafés, and from Gothic architecture debates to spooky vampire tales, every unplanned moment added a layer to our journey. It reminded us that sometimes, letting go of plans is the best way to truly experience a place. The unplanned moments — getting lost, discovering hidden gems, and letting go of rigid plans — made it unforgettable. Sometimes, the best travel stories aren’t the ones you plan. They’re the ones that find you.

Will: Budapest has commonly been part of a list some people call “The Four B’s of Europe”.
Belgrade, Barcelona, Budapest, and Berlin.
These are widely considered the best party cities on the continent. “Party” is subjective, but the common theme between these cities is that they all have robust club and bar scenes that are famous for many reasons. Budapest is unique because the bars have a certain type of grit, which makes them mysterious. They are usually underground, decrepit, and extremely old. But this gives them an indescribable atmosphere.
Carolina: Throughout our relationship, Will and I constantly joke about the ""Hungarian caves"" as we like to call the Budapestian bars. Personally, while my days of party raging are behind me, I do enjoy an occasional ~causal clubbing~ night out and was excited to see what Budapest had to offer.
The expectations were: cheap drinks, quirky bars, and great house music.
If we haven't mentioned it already, I regret to inform you that it turns out Budapest isn't as cheap as they say. We were disappointed to find that drink prices were on par with what we commonly find in the U.S. — $5 beers and $12 cocktails. There were, however, a few spots closer to the local and low-key end of the spectrum that we truly enjoyed.
Kisüzem (1st and 2nd photos above) is a casual sit-down bar on the outskirts of the Jewish Quarter where Will and I got to enjoy $4 beers and $9 cocktails.
It was the perfect place to kick off a night out or even just to grab some drinks and chat. While the vibes of Kisüzem were very relaxed, it was extremely hard to score a table or even a windowsill to sit on outside. Most of the people were chatting in Hungarian — which made it seem like a popular spot amongst the locals.
Will: The most famous (probably) tourist bar in Budapest is known as Szimpla Kert (pictured above). It’s interchangeable with the “ruins bar” and is usually the first result on Google for the query “Best bars in Budapest”. When people say “ruins bars”, they are talking about this place, which is located in the heart of the Jewish Quarter. It’s a little confusing, but it’s not “bars” plural in the sense that there are individual “bars” within the building; Szimpla Kert is a bar that has several places to buy drinks within it. Makes sense?
It’s an incredible space with multiple levels and plenty of room to roam. Inside is straight out of a Jackson-Pollack-painting-come-to-life. Various, random knick-knacks cover the walls and ceiling while each room is draped in vibrant lights. As large as it is, they still manage to pack it night after night, especially in the high season. Caro and I tried to go on a Friday around midnight, and the line was horrid. The appeal of this place is valid, and I’ll say it’s a definite must if you’re planning on going out to Budapest. Price-wise you can expect beers ranging from $5-$9 and cocktails for about $9–$13.
Carolina: Szimpla Kert is truly a sight to behold. A big part of the experience is getting lost in the maze of bars. Each one of them has its unique atmosphere. However, don't mistake this for a bar to go dancing at. While they do play music, there isn't a dance floor. Instead, there are tables where people gather around and sit to talk or play cards like we did.
Will: When it’s time to go dancing, there is one option that could satisfy everybody’s musical taste. It’s called Instant/Fogas, and it’s the most insane club I’ve ever seen. For Caro and I, this was it — the CAVES!
It has 6 (yes, 6) different rooms. On the entry floor, there are two large dance halls, one playing house music and the other playing general pop and throwback dance bangers from the likes of Madonna, Lady Gaga, Brittany, and Black Eyed Peas. The entry floor also has 4 to 5 bars, so getting a drink is no issue.
Downstairs, however, below the street, is where the complexity of Fogas can be truly celebrated. The Fogas underground features three distinct caves: heavy metal & rock, techno, and deep house. Each is separated by thick concrete and has its own bar. Being down there makes you feel incredibly edgy, but downstairs is where Fogas is the most fun. The music is great, the rooms are very spacious, and the overall vibe can’t be replicated. Granted, there are other underground bars in Budapest, but none like this. You feel the mysteriousness and grit of the city in a very unique way.
Carolina: For someone who likes to go dancing and has a Frankenstein music taste like mine, the Instant-Fogas Complex was a dream come true. However, I gotta say that there was another bar that stood out against all others. That was Viadukt, a Danube-side bar hidden underneath the trolley tracks.
During the day, the bar's green-painted metal doors are hard to distinguish from the other ones that are part of the viaduct where the trolly passes through. At night, the road becomes pedestrian-only, a black canopy tent is set up outside with a DJ playing house music sets, and tables and chairs distributed among the Danube bank. The green metal doors are wide open and the inside is decorated with an exhibition from a local artist. There's plenty of space to dance by the DJ and to sit and chat a bit further where the music isn't as loud. Regardless of where you decide to hang out, you get to enjoy the gorgeous lights of Buda across the river as well as a view of the Széchenyi Chain Bridge.
Both Viadukt and Instant-Fogas served their drinks in reusable branded plastic cups which Will and I kept. So, if we host you once we're back home, there's a chance that you might get to enjoy a drink from the cups we brought from Budapest.

I created a video about Budapest, Hungary’s capital, for the “Connecting cities” project. I took these photos while I was with the Erasmus program there, and I wanted to share with you my once in a lifetime experience! Enjoy! #connectingCities
Last year I was given the opportunity to participate in the Erasmus program. The city I was chosen to go was Budapest. As a student there I made a lot of friends, with most of them coming from other countries and cultures. As you can imagine, I broadened my horizons, I shifted my perspective about a variety of things and, as a result, I changed a lot about my way of thinking. My stay abroad was for one academic semester (about 6 months), where I was a student at Karoli Gaspar University! In particular, Erasmus is actually an exchange program between European Universities, in which students from European countries connect, collaborate and share their feelings and ideas with each other, while studying in a foreign country. In this way, students become more open-minded and self-confident.
Now, its time for me to show you some of the main attractions that Budapest is famous for, including what I felt and what I thought while being there. Also, I will try to make a comparison of these attractions to the Greek culture and natural heritage, trying to find out the similarities between these two ostensibly different countries, Hungary and Greece.
To begin with, one of the most famous attractions in Budapest, and Hungary in general, is the Danube river. While gazing the Danube river and its calm waves, I surely admired the serenity and the beauty of Hungary’s nature. It is such a nice place, where there are a lot of small kiosks, coffee shops and restaurants, in which you can enjoy this breathtaking landscape and view. It is definitely a place where even your deepest thoughts can be unfolded. Once, while I was drinking my cup of hot chocolate during a boat cruise through the river, it felt like I was in a sailing boat into the Aegean sea. Instantly, the lyrics of Randy Newman’s song came across my mind… ‘’I am looking at the river but I am thinking of the sea’’. Many feelings passed through me and along with this, the sense of nostalgia of the sea and my country made me feel that I am into the Aegean again.
It is said that one of the best known attractions of Budapest is “The Fisherman’s Bastion”, which was built in the 19th century. The Bastion is a castle named after the guild of fishermen that was responsible for defending the stretch of the city walls in the Middle Ages. At this time, it is a city viewing terrace, with a lot of stairs and walking paths, and serves the best panoramic view in Budapest! It is a spot that many tourists visit, in order to take amazing photos of the view and, of course, themselves, for remembering their holidays! Needless to say, the architectural style and placement of the castle makes you feel like you are a part of a fairy tale, by taking you back in time, especially in the wintertime.
When I started finding out more about the city, I discovered that, not only the close to Danube side of Budapest is amazing, but also the other districts both Buda and Pest. For example, there is an enormous square called ‘’Heroes square’’ in which huge buildings and monuments are exhibited. I recall that a guide was telling us once the detailed history of the square, and we were all amazed about how similar the Greek and Hungarian architecture was. For instance, the Museum’s of Fine Arts designers were inspired by the ancient temples of Greece, and that’s why the front of the building is classical with massive Corinthian columns. Apart from that, its exhibitions contain pieces of art from Ancient Greece and Rome, which is something that made me feel really proud.
In my opinion, Budapest is definitely a suitable place for traveling, but only someone who lives there can ascertain how the everyday life and behavior of its local citizens is. As a student there, sometimes I had reservations about some specific things, such as not being accompanied while walking home. But that’s an apprehension I would have in any city that I am not familiar with. In general, Budapest is considered an overcrowded city and people there are kind-hearten and open-minded, such as many Greeks are.
If you go to the city center of Budapest during the Christmas time, you will find small wooden houses selling traditional Hungarian, sweets, food and art, and everything smells cinnamon and coconut. Its typically called the “Christmas Market” and you will surely have a blast while being there!
While spending 6 months there, I tried to taste all kinds of different traditional Hungarian food. My main conclusion was that their recipes were similar with the Greek ones, but Hungarians use more spices and bigger amounts of garlic and onion. As an example to the above, both Hungary and Greece have a traditional recipe for stuffed peppers. In Greece this recipe is called ‘’Gemista’’, and apart from peppers, stuffed tomatoes and other vegetables may also be included. In Hungary, its called ‘’Töltött paprika’’ and, by default, there are only stuffed peppers included. In Greece, “Gemista” is stuffed with minced meat, rice, garlic, tomato sauce, onions and oil olive while in Hungary, it is stuffed with pork, rice, onion, garlic, paprika and tomato sauce. So, you can imagine how similar these recipes are to each other, despite the small differences that may occur.
Additionally, I need to write about the baroque style that characterizes Budapest. While walking around the city, the roads and the buildings make you feel like you are starring in a mystery movie! Most of European countries are conducted with this architectural style, which is why they are considered to be so “unique” and “special” compared to other countries. In Budapest, you will notice these buildings of Baroque architecture mainly in the castle district, but also in the Szechenyi Thermal baths, the Royal palace and St. Anna’s Church. This style makes the city an absolute architectural paradise!
Now days, there is a situation which many countries are facing, mainly due to the financial crisis that hit the European Union. Unfortunately, in both Budapest and Athens, are a lot of homeless people and their number is constantly being increased. Most of them are living in subway stations, underpasses, parks and areas with high criminality rates. A high percentage of them are drug addicts and alcoholics. The problem in both Budapest and Athens is that there aren’t enough shelters that can provide a descent place to live to those who can’t afford it. So, inevitably, they end up living in the streets. For example, as a solution to this unfortunate situation, the City Hall of Athens is planning to open an overnight shelter for the capital’s homeless, but this kind of plan needs a lot of effort and time to be invested in order to be successful soon enough.In conclusion, we realize that these two cities, Budapest and Athens, have come to deal with poverty due to all the problems caused by the financial crisis. As a case in point, the high level of unemployment was a fatal factor for the loss of many homes, which led to the increased number of homeless people all around the county.
If you are a new Erasmus student, don’t worry, you will quickly make a lot new friends from a bunch of different countries! Erasmus students are very friendly and open to new friendships and experiences. I remember the very first course where we got to meet each other. That course was the Hungarian language one, and my first thought about it was that the difficulty was pretty much the same as the Greek one. All the Erasmus students were joking about the difficulty of the language, and how we could cope with it. We couldn’t even pronounce the words in the right way! It’s really hard to speak Hungarian fluently…
Fortunately, 6 months are enough to find out a lot of hints about living in Budapest, and of course to get along with them too. I have to admit that I am really glad about choosing Budapest as my Erasmus destination. I gained a lot of experiences, felt a lot of emotions and I had the chance to bond with so many people from around the world! I strongly believe that if it wasn’t for Budapest, I wouldn’t be able to understand how much my country relates or differentiates with another one, or how identical or opposite it can be in various aspects! I would definitely not change a thing!

Yes, for sure!!
Budapest is one of the most beautiful, vibrant, and dynamic cities in the country of Hungary. It is the combination of two regions i.e., Buda — A hilly area, and Pest — A flat area, divided by the Danube River in centre.
The Hungarian capital has extremely exceptional sights on both banks of the Danube, a history of over 2000 years, vivid culture, and appetizing delicacies.
Everything you MUST know about the experiences here is as below:
This is one of the most architecturally spectacular and sacred buildings in the city located in the Pest region.
The St. Stephen Square in front of the basilica will give you a whole different feeling during the winters and summers as it comprises of Christmas market and terraces with parasols respectively.
The Basilica consists of a beautifully ornamented interior with statues, mosaics, murals, paintings, and stained glass which will surely amaze you about its history.

Will: We arrived in Budapest extremely hungry (see what I did there?). After disembarking from another lovely Flixbus trip, it was time to find our next home away from home.
Our Air BnB is in a popular area of the city called Oktogon. It’s a lively section of town full of restaurants, bars, shops, hotels, and grocery stores. We had no issues checking into our Air Bnb, and after a brief respite, it was time for dinner. Using our trusty dusty Happy Cow app we found a Mediterranean restaurant cheffing up some amazing salad bowls. Tucked in the Jewish Quarter, the owners welcomed us with big smiles and loaded us up with some felafel balls atop a bed of quinoa, salad greens, beats, and hummus. Post dinner we considered joining the masses in having a few drinks, but the travel day wore us out more than we anticipated. No need to rush it — we’ll be here all month!
Sunday was a settling-in type of day, and we had a mission.
Acquainting yourself with a brand-new city is fun in many ways; we’re learning to see its joy instead of overwhelming ourselves. Google Maps has become our best friend, and finding the most informative local blogs online has become a refined skill.
It might not seem like a real skill, but there are plenty of opportunities to be led astray when relying on the internet.
Carolina: As I'm writing this 22 days after ""moving"" to Budapest, I forget exactly the order of happenings for this day. But, as Will mentioned, we had some missions for Sunday.
For groceries, we gravitated towards Spar since that's the grocery chain we grew accustomed to in Zagreb. However, the Spar location near us wasn't the greatest — the quality of the veggies and variety was subpar, same could be said for their selection of vegan proteins, coffee, milk, and pasta. In the coming days we discovered that just across the street, there was a small local grocery chain (G Roby) that had everything we needed and more.
For the gym, we decided to tour a few spots. First, Nr1 Fitness — a 24/7 gym inside of what seemed to be an office building. As we walked in, we encountered a receptionist who, in broken English, told us that the gym was independent of the offices so she didn't have access to it. We decided to go check it out anyway behind the glass doors. As we did, two gym members came into the building and as they unlocked the doors to the gym, we slipped in with them.
The gym was small but not busy. It was a bit warm but it had everything we were looking for — ""It will be a good sweat session, kind of like hot yoga"" we told each other.
We then walked to 4% Fitness Corner — which is exactly what you would expect from a Budapest gym. House music booming through the speakers, cage-like room dividers, and muscle tees everywhere. It was only $10 extra than the other gym but there was more space, more machines, and the AC worked.
After touring the gyms, we decided to grab lunch and weigh our options. We walked to Kozmosz, an underground restaurant that serves vegan versions of traditional Hungarian dishes. Over chocolate-covered layered cake and coffee, we re-read the reviews for Nr1 and 4% and found out that many people had a hard time canceling their membership with Nr1, asking for a cancelation, still being charged, and not being able to get their money back. Now that's a problem we don't want to have. As we had discovered from our tours, 4% accepted cash payments. Additionally, there were no complaints of scammy business practices.
On the following day, we showed up at 4% and paid a month's worth of cash membership. And just like that, we had a gym.
Will: But what about when you’re suffering from screen fatigue? What is a way to explore a city without a phone? Caro and I have found going for a run works brilliantly.
Carolina: Going on casual runs has to be one of my favorite ways to explore somewhere. I say ""casual"" because the main objective of these runs isn't to hit a specific distance or keep at a certain pace. The objective is to go somewhere you've never been and see new things. To take the the byway just to see what it leads to. In these runs, it's more than okay to stop to take in the scenery, as the objective isn't to run.
That's how we decided to spend our first Sunday evening in Budapest. We ran up the street that connects Oktogon to the Budapest City Park — Andrássy út. Passing by gorgeous buildings such as HAB (Hungarian Art and Business), and the Alice Hotel. To reach the park, we ran around Hero's Square where we got a gorgeous view of the sunset (see picture below).
At the park, we ran aimlessly, allowing ourselves to get lost in the network of trails and pathways that cut through the park. At some point, we found ourselves at a Wine & Food festival (typical) in the shadows of the Vajdahunyad Castle. We also explored the park's extensive recreational sports infrastructures, and of course, the Széchenyi Thermal Bath.
On our way back, passing through the Hero's Square once again, we came across a Star Wars meet-up, over 200 people holding blue and red lightsabers. It was truly a sight to be seen.
Arriving back at Oktogon, we were lured into a local Pizza chain by the smell of baked dough, tomato sauce, and cheese. To my content, they had a veggie pizza option with no cheese. So we wrapped up another wholesome day with 2 slices of cheese-less pizza.

Few days after I came back from Trieste, I had lined up another trip, and this type it was sort of a vacation. Except that it wasn’t, since it was a summer school with a full 9–5 schedule and all that. But it was summer and I was going to be there for a week, so for me it was like taking a vacation trip!
This was my second time in Budapest, since I visited the city previously in 2016, but back then it was November and pretty cold, so I didn’t get to fully experience the city, the agenda was packed so I only got to see a little bit from the night life, which had intrigued me and I knew that sooner or later I would return to finish the job.
Also one big difference since the previous trip was that now I was staying at Pest — the bohemian part of the city, while the first time I was situated at Buda — the part with the hills and castles.
I got a really cheap flight from Skopje, like 40 Euros a round trip, which was a great deal considering that the first time I had to take THREE flights just to get to Budapest and additional two on the way back.
As soon as I got to my accommodation, the Ludovika Kampus Dormitory — which was fairly easy to find, I met my roommates, Pranav from Nepal and Yahya from Pakistan.
Since our dinner was scheduled for later that evening, we went to have coffee in the centre and to do some sightseeing. Some places were familiar to me, the St. Stephen Basilica and the famous Hungarian Parliament (which amazes me every time I see it).
Since Pranav and Yahya hadn’t been to the city before I showed them some of sights that I knew, the weather was great so we took a walk and after that we had some coffee. Soon it was time to go back and to prepare for the dinner where would meet that rest of the participants at the summer school.
The organizers had also provided us with public transport tickets for the whole week, so this was particularly useful since we could use whatever we like — the subway, trams, buses, even ferries!
Soon we met up with the rest of the participants, so there I’d meet the people with who I would spent the next week — Bernat from Catalunya, Silva from Italy, Leonie and Nina from Germany, fellow Balkanian Stere from Romania, Heidi from US/Netherlands, Celine from China, my great friend Vassiliki from Greece, Zuhair from Iraqi Kurdistan and many more.
During the next few days we got to hear some interesting lecture on populism and it’s rapid rise in Europe — but I also got to learn that it wasn’t just a problem that the EU is dealing with, but that the struggle is real for other parts in the world as well.
At that time the situation was also beginning to become complicated in Catalunya and Iraqi Kurdistan — so it was great to share some opinions and discuss the matter.
It was quite nice that we were in Hungary and discussing this topic — since we all know about Viktor Orban and his policy towards refugees. This added another dimension to the discussions and we heard some interesting points, coming from the Hungarian side, or at least some Hungarian experts that took part as lecturers.
So the next five days during the days we we’re discussing and researching this topics, while at nights we were discovering Budapest’s amazing nightlife! One of my favorite things from the Budapest nightlife is the vast number of ruin pubs throughout the city, and during that week we probably got to see like close to 10 different ruin pubs.
The first night we went to my favorite spot, the one that I visited three nights in a row during my last trip — Szimpla Kert! So basically this is like bar, that is set in a garden (or maybe the garden is set inside of a bar) and it has all kind of cool stuff — like old phones, chairs, chandeliers, video arcades — the place has everything, plus some quality drinks and it’s packed with tourists!
The first night we went there with Heidi and Stere, while most of the others were already tired, but the next night we also went to this place and had a great time!
However, during the next few days we got to some see different places and what I can say is that we weren’t disappoint! Budapest has so many ruin pubs to offer, so I’d definitely recommend that if you go there, go to Szimpla Kert for a while, and then visit some other places as well!
So one night we went to this place Golya Presso — also a ruin pub but much smaller than Szimpla but quite similar in a way. A Hungarian friend of mine, Zoltan, told me before that this place was sort of a hub for the leftists, and it definitely had that kind of atmosphere — especially it’s enterier.
Another night we went to this Red Ruin — by the name you can guess what kind place of it was –filled up communist memorabilia and Stalin, Mao, Lenin etc caricatures on the walls.
Has some beer and some palinka there — I have to admit that I could managed to drink just one shot of palinka, since in my opinion it was terrible — rakija is way better than that! We met some crazy drunk people there — one of them was a drunk barking man who scared couple of dogs that were inside the pub (sounds weird but it happened).
One more place that left a good impression on me was this ruin pub called Ankerts, where they had some great draft beer, good music and atmosphere, but unfortunately we didn’t stay there for too long.
During the day, beside the lectures, once or twice we also went around the city, on the Danube bank and it was pretty awesome to watch the sunset there and to have some drinks.
I love this city since it has it all — great architecture with a lot of history, awesome nightlife and good public transport — which means that you can truly get a great experience!
But I’d recommend going there during spring or summer, winter is not really friendly if you want to go and do some sightseeing. Budapest is especially breathtaking at night, with it’s shining lights — the Parliament building is just marvelous at night! The bridges on the Danube are quite the gem too, especially Szechenyi bridge!
I didn’t go to the Buda part this time, since most of the days we had activities and always stayed on the Pest side, which was full of nice surprises on every corner.
On the last day before we departed, actually it was our free day, we took a ferry on the Danube and visited the little riverside town of Szentendre,or as Lilit from Armenia would describe — a Serbian-style art town!
Beautiful small city with a big Serbian minority there and signs around the place that I could actually read — since they were written in cyrilics.
We had great lunch there — gulash inside a bread dish (I guess I can call it like this). We had gulash multiple times that week and other than that I can also remember eating one dessert that was really to die for — called Samloi Galushka.
The rest of the food we had was mostly international — we ate pasta, hummus, pizza, etc.
I guess that it actually was a vacation, beside all of the lectures and discussions, so during that week in Budapest I had fun, met some amazing people again, and learned a lot of new and cool stuff. The last day I had my flight in the morning, so basically it was time to go back to reality once again.

I know this is a blog about photography, but it’s also a blog about the way that we create and interpret imagery. I find Wes Anderson’s films a perfect focal point for this discussion about image, storytelling, and framing. Both because of what people seem to inherently understand about Anderson’s unique aesthetic, and also because of what people regularly misrepresent or ignore.
I’m not going to introduce Wes Anderson because if you’re reading this, you know his films. We all have our favourites- often the films which got us started with his 50s toned, highly symmetrical movies (mine is Rushmore). Today I’ll be talking about 2014’s The Grand Budapest Hotel and later about 2021’s The French Dispatch, because these films present (to me) a progression of Anderson’s use of the cinematic frame as a storytelling device.
Note on history of format and aspect ratio
35mm motion picture film- that is, the film itself- wasn’t a particularly revelatory technology. Industrial processing for 70mm photographic roll film was already established, and filmmaker WK Dickson found that by splitting the roll in half you got two 35mm rolls which were ample enough to capture the image rendered by lenses of the time.
Like many stories in early film history, Thomas Edison stuck his head in, forcing Dickson to spend the next five years attempting in vain to establish a new standard. But in the end and to this day, the economics of 35mm film have kept it as the standard, first capitalising on 70mm film industrialization, and later on its own mass production before any other format had the chance to get off the ground.
Traditional spherical lenses project a circular image. We cut the sides off for convenience and to avoid the outside edges of the image circle, which tend to be blurry. The most judicious use of the image circle (beyond simply leaving it circular) is to square it, which remains the standard in some large format photography. This square is, however, at odds with human perception. Every person experiences vision differently, but with two round eyes spaced apart, we can fairly assume that most people see the world significantly wider than square, and the history of aspect ratio is the economics and technology of rendering a cinematic image that better resembles our own eyes.
Early widescreen was limited by lens and film fidelity. You can only cut so far into your image before degrading the quality, widescreen had some success in using larger format 70mm film, but the most common ratios sat around 4:3. A slightly wider square, which was codified as the Academy Ratio after sound was added to movies.
The 4:3 academy frame was wider than square, without significantly reducing the amount of film (and ergo fidelity) used by each frame. Throughout the 1930s and 40s the Great Depression cut into discretionary spending, 70mm film was considered too expensive to use, and further widescreen advances lay dormant.
By the 1950s, the mainstream adoption of television forced filmmakers to innovate. Widescreen implementations which were as simple as changing the matte in a projector were only possible by letterboxing already small tv screens.
In 1952, 20th Century Fox bought rights to a military technology which allowed for wide angle viewing from inside tanks via oval lenses, and coming out with The Robe a year later– the first film shot in ‘scope’ format. Anamorphic lenses squeeze the image on the way into the film plane, allowing twice as much width to fit into a piece of film. The image is in turn desqueezed by the projector, turning a 4:3 frame of 35mm film into a 1:2.9 image. In 1954 Vistavision was established as a more economical way to widen screens, flipping 35mm negative sideways to give an aspect of 1:1.5 which could be further cropped to 1:2 and the modern television standard 1:1.85 (16:9).
Aspect Ratio in The Grand Budapest Hotel
The Grand Budapest Hotel is a nesting doll of narratives. We open to the shrine of a dead author, a visitor holds a book (The Grand Budapest Hotel), and turns to the author’s picture on the back cover. We match cut to the author in an office in 1985, the author tells us about the way stories fall into your lap once the world knows your an author. The aspect ratio changes to 1:1.85 (16:9).
The film is going to pull this menouvre on us often, and it’s keen to make us aware that multiple threads of storytelling are going to take place. It also wants us to know that these stories are being buffed a little with a polish of nostalgic recollection. When our author calls the hotel, “a picturesque, elaborate and once widely celebrated establishment” we cut again to 4:3, and a bright pink hotel reveals itself against an obvious matte painting and a foreground of dimensionless buildings. This part of the story, the filmmaking insists, is literally flattened by layers of recollection as the author character declares, “The incidents that follow were described to me exactly as I present them here, and in a wholly unexpected way.”
Through the remainder of Grand Budapest the moving frame lines serve to remind us not only that there are multiple timelines, but that each timeline is filtered through its own series of storytellers. Wes Anderson’s visuals get flack for being so easily identifiable, but they have an in-text justification in Grand Budapest, where the further removed our author gets from the action, the more the world takes on qualities of the fanciful and make-believe.
Throughout the film, danger is framed by windows- the Zubrowkan army enter the film via a train window, they are spied through a window in the hotel, and Dmitri’s henchman Joplin pursues Deputy Kovacs, first visible through a bus window: Danger abounds, but the existential threat of war seems almost out of scope with the limitations of the story. In the scene of Gustave’s death the frame is robbed of its intense colour, too raw still for Zero the storyteller (Agatha’s death is given no screen time, only narration over imagery of their wedding.)
Why?
So the movie is a nesting doll of different narratives which get progressively distorted through storytelling. It’s a study in the stories we tell, the people and places, we remember, and how we remember them. But also. Why?
Why 4:3 (1.375:1 for pedants), 1.85:1, and 2.35:1? Each time period in the film lines up with the mainstream adoption of that aspect ratio, and so the changing aspect ratios can be considered another part of the set design, which changes dramatically from timeline to timeline. As the browning halls of the 1968 Hotel are rendered in brilliant pinks and reds when we flash back to 1932, so too does the ceiling of the cinematic frame literally grow taller. The perspective literally grows wider and- perhaps- more nuanced- with the historical perspective. Does the film suggest that we’re so far removed from the 30s that what we can perceive is literally cut off on the sides? It’s for you to decide.
It may seem quite contrived to suggest that the narrowing aspect ratio represents a neglecting of the edges of our historical perception, but evidence for this can be found in the text. Our dual protagonists, Zero and Gustave, are a refugee and a bisexual, respectively. Theirs are stories which have been sidelined throughout history, and positioning them in this historical context- even in what remains a comedic romp for most of its runtime. Asks us as audience to consider what stories and characters like Zero and Gustave have been sidelined.
Wes Anderson’s movies draw attention to their own filmmaking to the point of easy categorisation and parody. But too often I believe people categorise as an easy out from analysis.
The estrangement effect has roots in Chinese theatre and Russian Formalism, but was codified into Western theatre by Bertolt Brecht. Brecht’s aim for the estrangement effect (verfremdungseffekt) was that breaking the illusion, and reminding the audience that they were viewing a piece of fiction would force them to engage with the underlying politics. Wikipedia’s description is quite elegant:
“By disclosing and making obvious the manipulative contrivances and “fictive” qualities of the medium, the actors attempt to alienate the viewer from any passive acceptance and enjoyment of the play as mere “entertainment”. Instead, the goal is to force viewers into a critical, analytical frame of mind that serves to disabuse them of the notion that what they are watching is necessarily an inviolable, self-contained narrative. This effect of making the familiar strange serves a didactic function insofar as it aims to teach the viewer not to take the style and content for granted, since (proponents argue) the theatrical medium itself is highly constructed and contingent upon many cultural and economic conditions.”
“Disclosing and making obvious the manipulative contrivances” may not be Wes Anderson’s obvious aim, but the fact that his films are so readily categorised and broken down may at least hint that the estrangement effect is in place. And what are the politics of The Grand Budapest Hotel? It concerns two fringe identities in the face of encroaching fascism.
It is in this way that Grand Budapest is tidily packaged in that thematic dichotomy can be found in the visual aesthetic, and the two feed back into one and other: The rose-tint of nostalgia against the cultural trauma of fascism.
It can seem counter-intuitive, when one of the major criticisms levied against Anderson’s films is that they hide lack of substance behind beautiful aesthetics. But if we consider that the opposite may be true, can the lush aesthetics of The Grand Budapest Hotel, especially during the aesthetic rug-pull of the tawdry 1968 hotel, be hiding its politics precisely within its visuals? The set designs of Grand Budapest Hotel took inspiration from ski resorts rendered in photochrom, a method of colouring black and white photography by hand. They appear stunning in their subtle pastel palettes. But at the same time, the colours they claim to represent are entirely fabricated- left to the artistic choices of the colourist. The hyperreality throughout The Grand Budapest Hotel reminds us that all is not what it seems, and the centering of characters who would have been sidelined by fascism and other historical oppressions serves to challenge our romanticised notions of pre-war Europe.
Which brings us back to the box. The shape of the box in which the Grand Budapest Hotel plays out literally changes shape throughout the movie. Within, it helps guide us through jumps between time periods, but outside of the box, the changing shape serves to remind us that it is the box that we are watching. That this is a fictionalised, romanticised and nostalgic rendition of a far different reality. I think, if you’ve been willing to follow me this far, the characteristic Wes Anderson visuals and irreverent humour do credit to this film. They make the film appear beautiful and whimsical, but in doing so, challenge the viewer to contemplate what parts of a story remain too painful to tell, what has recollection- and history in turn- brushed outside of the frame?

I knew the Danube River and Hungary at a very young age because of piano — Johann Strauss’s “The Blue Danube”. Nearly 15 years later, in 2014, I finally paid a visit to Hungary.
The Danube river is like a belt twining in the mid Europe. Budapest, straddles the banks of the Danube River, and the buildings in the city are pearls on the Danube belt. I arrived at Budapest at the end of April, as an unprecedented heat wave washed over Europe — from Berlin ,Warsaw, Krakow, Prague, to Budapest, the heat wave was chasing me, along with sudden showers that often arrived late afternoon. When it was not raining, the earth was shrouded in heat radiation.
Budapest used to be two cities — Buda, and Pest. Buda was the capital city, and is presently the capitol. Across the river, Pest is 2 times bigger, where most of the city residents live.
The front foot of Pest was already in modernity, everywhere is Costa Coffee,European version of Starbucks, and every car has a European Union’s license plate, indicating the reform and transition of Hungary; and the back foot was still halted in the old time, as trolleys in 1950s styles were still running, and the marble exterior of most buildings were with had turned into yellow over the years. Pest barely had urban forestry. Exposure to excessive sunlight in late April had melted my skin, as if was some sort of ice cream. Perhaps a while back ago, Pest did have sufficient street trees, but those trees withered. There were always a few corners of the street, full of overgrown glasses, existing there alone without the accompany of street tress.
I did some of my schoolwork (I was an exchange student in a university at Germany) on the first night at a Costa. The coffee shop was quite empty, I was facing a window covered by raindrops that look like crystal sticking on the glass window, reflecting the night light on the street. Only one waitress was serving behind the bar, and she was as young as me. I biked along the river bank crossed the bridge between Buda and pest, again and again. Even Pest was where most of the city population resided, its streets were quite empty, besides a bunch of tourists sitting on the outdoor seating of the cafés around the street corners.
Then the late afternoon rain started dropping. I hided in a Costa Coffee until the rain died down. I paddled the bike over the stone road shining like mirror after the shower. When I got back to the hostel we stayed, I ordered some dishes from the Turkish restaurant across the street — Budapest used to be the biggest Jewish populated city. Millions of Jews were transported to Auschwitz from this city. It’s also the biggest resided city of Romanic people, now, it also a population of Turkish immigrants.
I fled to a Costa coffee until The last night at Budapest, before our departure back to Germany, we met our temporary roommate in the hostel, a Korean lady, around 40 years old- she was single, just quitted her job, flied from South Korea to the European continent, travel alone around Europe. She slept on the upper level of the bunk bed, above me.

Hi there! Maeghan & Oli here - we're taking a break to travel the world and hope you'll join us for the ride. 🌏✈️ 👫 www.alittledetour.ca

We’re not going to lie, Maeghan was a little upset to learn that the Grand Budapest Hotel didn’t exist in real life…. but with everything that we heard about Budapest, she felt optimistic with the our next destination.
Budapest was fantastic. We walked around most days exploring the city and eating great food. There were so many different craft beer bars and bottles shops, this is the first time we didn’t have a chance to hit them all! Budapest was also super popular with stag parties and student travellers — I guess it is just that time of year.
We also hit a snag when we had our first encounter with bed bugs in our Airbnb downtown. But our skills as backpackers has reached a new level of awesome and we had identified the problem, found a new place, packed our bags and were out of there in under 15 minutes.
Other than that, we loved it here so much, we decided to extend our stay not once, but twice 😊
See more on our website www.alittledetour.ca🌏✈️👫
On our second day in Budapest. Maeghan was sitting on the couch journaling and Oli was on his computer researching. We decided to switch places so we could recharge our devices and Olivier went on a hunt to find another power outlet. He looked behind the couch and noticed a tiny little bug on the wall in the living room…. it looked kind of like a bed bug…
So he grabbed a spoon, put the little guy in a glass and started a fine eye search to see if there was more. Well… there was.
Olivier found a dozen or so dead bed bug bodies (or a high confidence they were after looking at Google) and put them on a paper towel. Maeghan called the Airbnb host to ask him about this.. since Olivier kept finding more and more bodies and the skins of the bugs inbetween all the crevases of the couch.
Our host said they had bed bugs a few weeks ago, but had the exterminator come twice.. and not to worry unless we found a living one… and we did..
So within 15 minutes… we had their bags packed, space cleaned and they were ready to peace — with success. No bed bugs were carried and they found a new nicer Airbnb all in the nick of time!
The 2nd largest thermal pools in the world next to Iceland. We hope to visit both!
We saw this and thought of all our PasswordBox friends❤️. Ping Pong was an intense sport in the office, we had two and there would always be tournaments.. or two co-workers battling it out. But this seems like a new level of ping pong!
Ruin bar. Made in the ruins of an old building and furnished with only 2nd hand things. Also, has 18 bars in the one location — so you can go to the wine bar, gin bar, craft beer bar… etc. The best place for any group party!

Let me tell you something upfront — Budapest isn’t the kind of city that screams for your attention like Paris or New York. It doesn’t shove its famous landmarks in your face. Instead, Budapest whispers. It draws you in quietly, one crumbling facade, one steaming chimney, one café window at a time. You don’t just “visit” Budapest — you drift through it.
I’ve walked these streets on misty winter mornings when the Danube looks like a silver ribbon cutting through the grey, and I’ve wandered them under the lazy orange glow of summer evenings when locals sit outside sipping fröccs and laughing like they’ve got all the time in the world. Budapest’s charm lives not only in its grand buildings but in the cracks between them.
This post isn’t about the tourist checklist. You already know the Parliament building looks like a gothic wedding cake and that the Chain Bridge is Instagram-worthy from every angle. I want to talk about the streets, the people, the smells, the awkward little corners where life in Budapest feels raw, imperfect, and utterly human.
You know you’re in the real Budapest when the sidewalks get uneven. The main boulevards — Andrássy Avenue, for example — are polished and postcard-perfect. But duck into the side streets, and suddenly the city exhales. Laundry flaps in courtyards, tiny grocery stores glow under flickering neon, old women with floral scarves shuffle along clutching plastic bags, and young students sit on crumbling stoops scrolling on their phones.
There’s graffiti here — some of it art, some of it just bored teenagers marking territory. But the layers of history are impossible to miss. You’ll pass an art nouveau balcony hanging precariously over a 1970s shoe repair shop. Above, the cracked stucco peels like old paint, revealing the city’s stubborn spirit underneath.
Walk around District VIII — Józsefváros. It’s raw, rough around the edges, but it’s real. Here, hip cafés with Edison bulbs and oat milk lattes sit side-by-side with corner bars where old men drink Unicum and mutter about politics. If you want shiny, sanitized Europe — this isn’t it. But if you want life? Welcome to Budapest.
Budapest has a specific smell — part bakery, part car exhaust, part sweet paprika floating from someone’s kitchen window. And yes, sometimes a hint of cigarettes — Hungarians smoke like it’s still 1995. But that mixture? It feels like a real city. A city where people live, not just pose for photos.
Stop by a pékség (bakery) in the morning. The langos might already be sizzling in oil, but most locals are grabbing simple pastries — kifli (crescent rolls), túrós batyu (sweet cheese pockets), maybe a slice of pogácsa (savory scone) if they skipped breakfast. Coffee? Strong. Cheap. No nonsense. Just the way it should be.
Here’s what I love — Budapest locals don’t care that you’re a tourist. They’re not rude, they’re not overly friendly — they’re just… doing their thing. If you want to fit in, keep your voice down, your head up, and your eyes open. Don’t expect big grins and “How’s your day going?” — this isn’t Disneyland. But ask for directions? Most people will help. Stumble through a few words in Hungarian? Their eyes soften immediately.
My favorite? Watching older folks play chess in the parks, completely oblivious to the TikTok kids filming dance videos nearby. It’s two worlds colliding — but that’s Budapest.
Skip the overpriced tourist menus on Váci Street. Head to the side streets for hearty, grandmother-approved meals. Goulash soup in a steaming ceramic bowl. Crispy duck legs with red cabbage. Cheap, buttery nokedli dumplings. It’s heavy. It’s filling. It’s perfect for cold evenings when your breath fogs the air.
And the bakeries? Let me say it again — never underestimate a Hungarian pastry.
Okay, let’s get real for a second. Budapest might feel like another world, but getting here isn’t rocket science.
Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport (BUD) welcomes budget airlines and major carriers alike. From most European cities, flights hover around €30–€100 if you book smart. From the US? Expect around $500–$800 round-trip, depending on the season.
Skip the overpriced taxis at arrivals. The 100E Airport Bus runs straight to the city center for about €5. Runs every 20 minutes. Easy.
It wasn’t the fancy cafés or grand architecture. It was this random Tuesday morning in early spring. Light drizzle. Streets still wet from rain. I ducked into a tiny coffee shop off Kálvin tér. The window fogged up as I sipped bitter coffee and listened to Hungarian indie rock playing softly. Outside, people hurried past with umbrellas, the city carrying on, oblivious to my little moment of stillness.
That? That’s why I travel. Not for the bucket list. For the seconds in between.
Budapest is rough around the edges, sometimes crumbling, often unpredictable — but never fake. It doesn’t try to impress you with perfection. It lets you discover its flaws, its beauty, its rhythm — and decide for yourself.
You might not “fall in love” instantly. But give it time. Walk the streets. Breathe in the mix of pastry, paprika, and city life. Listen to the language you don’t understand but somehow feels familiar.
And when you leave? You’ll miss it — I promise.

We exited Szimpla Kert and stepped out into the dark, rustic alleys of Budapest. The fragrant fall air of late October brought hints of change, and this once-ruined city at night gave the impression we were traveling in another world.
While walking the streets in that state of traveler’s bliss, we joked about the twists of fate that had brought the two of us to this place, still buzzing on the beers we had shared in a vintage bathtub in the maze that was the ruin bar we had just left.
As we passed through the alley, a figure moving against the crowd was nonchalantly listing out choice substances to no one in particular, not-so-subtly soliciting interest.
The indulgences of the night had lulled me to let my guard down, and so I thought nothing of her flagging the guy down in the crowded street, and inquiring about the availability of some grass. There were two of us, and just this one man, so what risk was there?
As they conducted a transaction in hushed words, I felt no cause for alarm. My friend was confident in these kinds of situations and…

This article is a postscript to a previous article I wrote about how Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel uses a timeline of cinematic technology and formatting to differentiate nesting framing devices. Hinted at but slightly outside of the scope of that article was Anderson’s use of theatrical techniques. Specifically- in echoing Brecht’s Epic Theatre. The Grand Budapest Hotel deals directly with fascism, so it seems worthwhile to compare the Marxist and antifascist underpinnings of Brecht’s technique, with the ways Wes Anderson succeeds (and fails) to employ them.
One of the primary goals for the establishment of the Frankfurt School was to interrogate why the German Revolution of 1918 ended the way it did. How did the birthplace of Karl Marx find itself at the end of a political upheaval turning to the allures of capitalism, and ultimately, fascism?
Bertolt Brecht’s Epic Theatre is one of a number of artistic forms which attempted to side-step the motivations of capitalism and to speak directly to his audience. I am no Brecht scholar, and a lot of nuance will be glossed over in this article, however put as simply as possible Epic Theatre employed a range of techniques aimed to snap their audience back into reality. And where were they really? They were in a theatre, watching a play.
Brecht thought that by refusing to let his audience suspend their disbelief, he could force them to engage with the ideas and values of his play, rather than getting lost in investment in the character’s emotional journeys. Brecht was a Marxist, and the ideas and values his plays contained were often specifically anti-capitalist ones. Some thinkers of the Frankfurt School further theorised on these techniques, which we’ll talk about later in this article.
“I find Bertolt Brecht’s epic form, only out of focus, muddied by the bourgeois values of the neoliberal era.” says G.D. Brown of Wes Anderson’s most recent film The French Dispatch in a fairly incendiary Popmatters Article.
No matter Wes’ personal politics, his work is forged in neoliberalism. No matter how artistically successful any viewer may find his works, it is the box office that decides whether Wes Anderson keeps making movies. Furthermore, if he does aspire to the same revolutionary art which forged the Brechtian aesthetic, it is not apparent from his subject matter, nor his frequent brand collaborations.
“It is hardly a wonder that Anderson has directed commercials for SoftBank and American Express, for the likes of Stella Artois, Prada, H&M, AT&T, Hyundai, and Sony. His highly-stylized advertisements have connected common products and the arms of finance to sophisticated notions of film as elevated art, to visual reassurances of certain standards of taste and cultured cool. Of course, Anderson is not the first director of artistic merit to commercialize his talents. Supper won’t pay for itself.” G.D. Brown, Life After Brecht: Wes Anderson’s Lowbrow Dialectics
For Brown, the neoliberalism of Anderson’s aesthetic is rotten to its core: Its themes of minority identity under fascism function as appeals to the comfort of modernity rather than provocative calls to action. Indeed, the communists in Grand Budapest are just as hostile and threatening to the film's protagonists as the fascists (whether the communists depicted in Grand Budapest represent anything like actual communism is outside of the scope of this article.)
“In Brecht’s plays, his cues leading audiences away from the naturalist immersion of storytelling and toward the theater as an unreal portrayal (his breaking the fourth wall, his narrators and movements into song, and so on) were meant to prod the viewer into meaningful engagement with their own historical circumstances…
Anderson has faced criticism for his portrayal of largely white, upper-class characters in contrast with the roles of workers and people of color. As the viewer becomes aware of Anderson’s on-screen values, they must, like Brecht, take on the dialectical mindset to best understand the infusion of revolutionary form and bourgeois content, placing Anderson in the context of the neoliberal turn of the last half of the 20th Century.”
— G.D. Brown, Life After Brecht: Wes Anderson’s Lowbrow Dialectics
The accusation- for those who find this style exhausting (and I’m aware my writing often falls into this style)- is that Wes Anderson uses the stylings of revolutionary art, which is real and important. However, he uses them as a hollow appropriation. Anderson (though not necessarily through conscious intention) is packaging up the Brecht’s technique the same way he packages up other high-brow aesthetics (fine art, high fashion), resulting in an easily digestible remedy for intellectual and class anxiety.
An excellent quote from Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello’s The New Spirit of Capitalism, (which I pilfered from an also great Broey Deschanel video) spells out the process by which contemporary capitalism consumes and repackages revolutionary ideas, saying:
“To maintain its powers of attraction, capitalism therefore has to draw upon resources external to it, beliefs which, at a given moment in time, possess considerable powers of persuasion, striking ideologies, even when they are considered hostile to it.”
— Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello, The New Spirit of Capitalism
Conversely, it could be argued that this form of neoliberal media is the necessary conduit to deliver revolutionary ideas to a mainstream audience. In The Andersonian Theatricality by Irene Kalesi, Anderson’s use of humour is explored as a cloak through which to smuggle critique and revolutionary ideas. Having made the link to Brechtian technique, Kalesi writes:
Comedy when used accurately can be the harshest judge of situations and the greatest fighter for change. Jones points out that “comedy is a vehicle for subtly (or not so subtly) addressing these injustices by mocking the social norms in the hope of slowly changing the masses’ beliefs about the inequalities”. Therefore, the employment of comedy can be pointed towards parodying and thus criticizing war and the collapse of the social ideals. The comedic atmosphere helps the audience engage with the film’s sensitive topic, namely a story that takes place during a tumultuous historical period. This bittersweet story needs the comedic perspective in order to avoid being an overly emotional burden on the viewer. The power of theatre is that it helps the audience not to identify with a character per se but it makes them contemplate deeply about the events happening on stage. According to Aristophanes, serious matters should be touched by the genre of comedy. As Dicaepolis from “Acharnians” says: “Comedy too can sometimes discern what is right. I shall not please but I shall say what is true”. Therefore, the power of comedy is to reveal truths and centralize issues that concern the spectators.
— Irene Kalesi, The Andersonian Theatricality
In Marxist theory, praxis is the putting of theory into action: it can be used to emphasise the importance of engagement and activity toward a common goal, without dismissing the importance of theory.
So does Wes Anderson’s work, specifically The Grand Budapest Hotel, hold up to the criticisms of the Frankfurt School aestheticians who created the groundwork for understanding Brecht’s epic theatre? I’m not uniquely qualified to tell you. But we can try to chase the logic down together: Writing specifically about Brecht, Walter Benjamin wrote:
“The task of epic theatre, Brecht believes, is not so much to develop actions as to represent conditions. But ‘represent’ does not here signify ‘reproduce’ in the sense used by the theoreticians of Naturalism. Rather, the first point at issue is to uncover those conditions. (One could just as well say: to make them strange.) This uncovering (making strange, alienating) of conditions is brought about by processes being interrupted.”
— Walter Benjamin, Understanding Brecht
And furthermore:
“Epic theatre casts doubt upon the notion that theatre is entertainment. It shakes the social validity of theatre-as-entertainment by robbing it of its function within the capitalist system. It also threatens the privileges of the critics. These privileges are based on the technical expertise which enables the critic to make certain observations about productions and performances. The criteria he applies in making his observations are only very rarely within his own control; he seldom worries about this, but relies upon ‘theatre aesthetics’ in the details of which nobody is particularly interested. If, however, the aesthetic of the theatre ceases to remain in the background, if its forum is the audience and its criterion is no longer the effect registered by the nervous system of single individuals but the degree to which the mass of spectators becomes a coherent whole, then the critic as he is constituted today is no longer ahead of that mass but actually finds himself far behind it.”
— Walter Benjamin, Understanding Brecht
This leaves us at somewhat of a junction in considering Anderson. Is the Andersonian Aesthetic a reproduction of these ‘theatre aesthetics’, or does the use of theatrical technique and aesthetic in a cinematic context alienate the viewer from more conservative cinematic techniques? I think your opinions about neoliberalism may define where you sit.
If all revolutionary aesthetics are consumed and repackaged under capitalism, is praxis in media possible? Herbert Marcuse, another thinker of the Frankfurt School, was slightly more optimistic.
“It seems that art as art expresses a truth, an experience, a necessity which, although not in the domain of radical praxis, are nevertheless essential components of revolution”
— Herbert Marcuse, The Aesthetic Dimension
Marcuse took it one step further than Benjamin in that he believed it was the authentic artistic experience that anyone could encounter the thirst for revolution and come to sympathise with the failings of capitalism. Whether Wes Anderson’s art hits even this bar for authenticity is again up to personal judgment.
That capitalism will, in time, homogenise all cinematic aesthetics into a sort of grey sludge seems inevitable. You can see it happen in real time. But hangers-on like Wes Anderson, who thrive in a space that is alternative if only by degrees- these artists may well be the first glimpse of real art many filmgoers experience. Can intellectually honest ideas be mined from these works? This writer believes that even if they can’t, you ought to look.

When I was younger, single with not many cares in this world, I traveled quite a bit. I still do but it’s different now.
I was fortunate to work for a company based near Bristol, England. Once or twice a year I would travel to our corporate offices for meetings and/or training. Lucky me!
I would almost always take advantage of being overseas and book my vacations from there. Inexpensive flights to European cities made it a no-brainer.
One of the trips I took was to Budapest. I was quite spoiled as I acquired hotel points that allowed me to stay in hotels I would not have otherwise been able to afford.
Like the Marriott right on the Vltava River overlooking the Chain Bridge and Castle Hill. This was the view from my room.
I spent five or so days wandering around. For three of those days, a co-worker friend flew over and met me. It was nice to have someone to hang out with for a few days.

The more we observe a city, the more apparent it becomes that it surpasses the sum of its parts. It resembles a colossal, intricate organism with its network of organs and unique internal dynamics. These dynamics are a tapestry woven from our daily interactions within the city: the bustling morning and evening rush on the tram or subway lines and leisurely strolls along the riverbank — it all contributes to this vibrant tapestry.
Though it sounds idyllic, it stands worlds apart from the vast data streams of corporations, the omnipresent data visualization tools, the ongoing buzz about artificial intelligence across various platforms, or even the fundamental essence of artistic expression — music.
“Melody of Budapest,” sponsored by Telekom Hungary, aims to bridge these divides by transforming the city’s dynamic mobility patterns into a musical piece using data science and AI. Initially, Janosov and the data team of Telekom Hungary processed large-scale cell tower-based mobility data at a resolution of 100m into digestible information. This unpublished data covers the temporal and spatial specifics of every mobile phone event on Telekom’s network in Budapest, Hungary, from June 2022 to 2023, linked to their…

Dear Margaret,
I traveled home to Hungary several times since I moved to France, the last time we met. I always just ran through the city to catch my connection to my home town and never stopped by to embrace the beauty of it again. Since you moved abroad too, there was nothing to keep me here for longer.
This time, it was different. My boyfriend came with me and I started to look at the streets we used to walk distinctly — like I’ve never seen them before, like an actual tourist.
At first glance, it seemed like everything remained the same — your favorite art nouveau buildings, the century old parks, historical squares… If only those walls could talk!
Yet, everything seemed changed. It’s been only 4 years since we said our goodbye here but it feels like decades have passed.
I took my boyfriend to the Danube river, or as we call it in Hungarian: Duna, for a stroll taking advantage of the last warm days of summer. I never noticed before how green our capital is, did you Margaret? I don’t recall if we ever talked about it.

We arrived in Budapest after traveling for twenty-two hours. We were tired.
My husband and I were new to river cruising and decided to get our feet wet with what some call the grand-daddy of Viking cruises — The Grand European Tour.
This cruise would take us from Budapest to Amsterdam over two weeks on the Danube, Main, and Rhine Rivers through the heart of Europe. We had no idea what to expect on our first night.
Before dinner, I asked if my husband could walk through Budapest with me across the famous Chain Bridge. I knew he was tired, but for me — he said yes. I had explained that we’d be departing the next evening before the city was lit and I wanted to get some photographs.
I’m blessed with an adoring and amenable husband. He knows one of my life’s greatest pleasures is taking photographs—especially on a trip.
When we left the ship, we weren’t ready for the beauty of Budapest at night. This walk over the Chain Bridge from Pest to Buda, on that first night, is one of my favorite and most beautiful parts of our European river cruise vacation.

Recently, I was on a river cruise through the Lower Danube on AmaWaterways with Christian (TellMeWhyTravel). The stops along the way included Budapest, Hungary, Bratislava, Slovakia, Durnstein, Salzburg, and Vienna, Austria. All of the cities are known for its historical importance from war, due to their strategic location on the river, to arts and culture, where some of the greatest minds which ever existed created. However, by the time you’ve gotten to this page, you already know about Mozart, the Hungarian Parliament, Buda Castle, and the other tourist attractions your tour guide will show you. As our tour guide YOLO (Yes! That’s his name!) said, “Do you see ABC? ABC, another bloody church, additional broken castle.” While I can respect the art and architecture, and the blood, sweat, and tears that went into the churches, castles, and monuments of the era, once I’ve seen one (or two) I’ve kind of seen them all. (There are definitely some cool churches and castles but that’s for a different story!)
I’m going to take you off the beaten path and show you some of the art and culture of today in these cities. Today’s obscure artists will be the Mozart’s, Picasso’s, and Spielberg’s of tomorrow. The Internet has brought most of the things to our homes but art is something we must experience in person!
If you’re staying at the Aria next to the Church of St. Stephen, you’re in a good place to start.
Most of the museums are within walking distance between 1–3 miles and you’ll get to see the other landmarks of Budapest along the way!
So let’s get started!
Want to check out some contemporary art museums further up?
Both of these museums looked pretty cool, unfortunately the Q was temporarily closed for installation.
If you’re already tired or didn’t see anything interesting you can check out the Széchenyi Thermal Bath, which features 18 pools and saunas but also has an exciting retro architecture, which reminded me of high school.
But maybe you’re not done yet. Walk down past the ruin bars to the Palace District.
Have a drink or two here, usually you’ll find some live music, poetry reading, or lively conversation!
From here there are a few advanced options:
About 25 minutes away is the Ludwig Museum, related to the Mumok in Vienna. It’s worth seeing some of the collection which includes Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, and Joseph Beuys.
Cross the bridge and at the base of Gellért-hegy Jubileumi park is Faur Zsófi Gallery. We hiked to the top of it, but the park is still undergoing renovations but a stunning view nonetheless.
Also closeby is the music venue A38, where we were lucky enough to see the band Henge.
Not tired yet? Cross the chain bridge and get to the Buda side of the city.
In the oldest part of the city, Obuda, stands a shrine to one of the city’s most famous contemporary artists, Victor Vasarely, the father of the optical art movement.
Then cross back over to Pest and hit Kalman Maklary Fine Arts an interesting contemporary gallery (no exhibitions this year yet) which is close to parliament and a short stroll from the Aria.
If you happen to come in mid October, check out Art Market Budapest which is also near the first round of galleries near the opera house and the Aria.
Now if you didn’t finish all of that in your two day pre-cruise, don’t worry, you’ll have a chance to come back at the end of the cruise!
Sailing
The Slovak National Gallery is close to where the ship docks.
Three options for the outskirts of the city; I don’t think you can walk here, you might need to take a taxi, bike, or public transportation.
Rudavskys Magic Garden: The garden is closed for the winter, but looks incredible when it’s warmer!
The Július Koller Society
Tranzit
Danubiana Meulensteen Art Museum: This looks like a very cool museum atop a peninsula jutting into the Danube. I didn’t see it from the ship, but along with its sculpture park, it seems like an awesome place to check out the latest contemporary art!
Sailing
The next stop is in the Wachau Valley, specifically Durnstein. While Durnstein is a quiet town with not much contemporary art, 8km from Durnstein is a small cosmopolitan town, Krems an der Donau, with some interesting art options.
The map is zoomed out to show the proximity to Durnstein where the ship is docked.
Sailing
The following day we docked and took about a 90 minute bus ride to the quaint city of Salzburg, known for being the birthplace of Mozart. It’s also known for being the backdrop to the 1960’s classic The Sound of Music.
The city is surrounded by a steep rock face which made it an impenetrable during times of war. However, the top of mountain is a contemporary art museum. You get natural and manmade art from the top of the elevator ride!
But before we get there, global gallery Thaddaeus Ropac has two locations in Salzburg! Check to see if there are exhibitions at the farther one near the train station before you trek up there.
Finally, Galerie HAAS & GSCHWANDTNER is moving from its downtown location to somewhere else within Salzburg. Check their website to see where they end up!
Sailing
We made it! Vienna, Austria the largest, most cosmopolitan city on the Danube. The art scene here is huge with tons of galleries, museums, and history.
We will try to avoid the two most famous artists from Austria, Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt, because the Neue Gallery on 86th and 5th in New York houses Ronald Lauder’s huge collection of Austrian art including Klimt’s Lady in Gold.
The bus to old city will drop you about 5 minutes northeast of St. Stephen’s Cathedral.
There are a lot of galleries in the first district, here’s the east side of the city first.
The west side is next, the order is assuming that you are coming from the bus drop off location
On the east side of the outer museum loop
There are a few major art fairs that take place in Vienna:
March: Spark Art Fair
May: Affordable Art Fair
September: Vienna Contemporary and Curated By
November: Vienna Art Week
Austrian artists that I didn’t get a chance to see:
Stefan Eins: He stopped by my Times Square exhibition multiple times and had some crazy stories about when he started Fashion Moda in the South Bronx in the 80s.
Andre Heller: Multi-hyphenate who commissioned Luna Luna
Helmut Lang: the famed photographer
Franz West: Sculptor and artist
On the outskirts of the city is the Essl Museum, which houses what is considered the most important collection of Austrian art after 1945.
From here the ship sails back to the beginning port, Budapest.
Did we miss something? Drop a comment and we’ll be sure to check it out next time and let you know how it was.
Interested in recreating this experience? (You’ll now have the maps to save time instead of us stumbling around)
Here’s the link to the AmaWaterways cruise and the Aria hotel, which is voted the best in Central Europe consistently!
NB: There was an issue with Google Maps acting weird so instead of wasting time figuring it out, I made different maps for each art “district” in Budapest and Vienna.

There is a certain pattern I notice in cities all over Europe that is both unique and also interesting. If there is a huge shopping mall either as part of the complex or in the immediate vicinity of the main railway station of an urban area, that particular city has a lot to offer to its visitors. In the case of Poznań, it is no different either.
On the surface, the city on the River Warta is one of Poland’s largest urban conurbations, a hub of education, and an important business center. However, once you scratch the surface, the city becomes significantly more than another bustling metropolis. Poznań is home to a plethora of historic and cultural references.
Amid the many modern buildings and high-rise apartments, the city also showcases an eclectic mix of Baroque, Gothic and neoclassical architecture. There are many Budynek zabytkowy (listed buildings) and Pomnik historii (historic monuments) scattered around in the city, the ownership of which comes with certain obligations and restrictions.
On second thoughts, I believe a major shopping mall attached to the main station complex in…

Ever wondered how to draw a map of less common geographical areas? And color them based on some data? This pair of tutorials shows how to build this from scratch! First, you need to construct the border of your polygons — Part 1 is about this task. After that you need to create a map, and color those polygons according to some value of your interest. That will be shown in Part 2.
Part 1 of this tutorial is available here.
There are many tutorials on the internet for drawing maps in Python, even more sophisticated maps like heatmaps (where heat is basically the density of points in an area) or choropleth maps (where polygons are colored according to some arbitrary value). However, these tutorials are mainly done on states of the United States. View some great ones with plot.ly or an also otherwise superb one with folium. For the US, these packages have some convenience methods, but for the rest of the world, they’re of little use. Alternatively, they are based on some accidentally available json file like this one with Altair. Obviously, these are not general solutions to the problem of creating a map of some areas of your choice. I aim to give a general solution in these articles.
In this second part you will:
The code is also available on GitHub:
github.com
A GeoJson is actually a JSON file with some predetermined structure. The function above generates a GeoJSON file from a list of points by JSON dumping a dictionary formatted like a GeoJSON file. In these dictionaries, there are only 3 keys: lat, lon and name. Lat and lon stand for the coordinates, while name identifies the shape that the point belongs to. The order of these dictionaries in the list is also critical, you can read about this in the first part of this tutorial.
GeoDataFrames are a subclass of classic `pandas` DataFrames with a special column. This special column, geometry contains all the information that makes this DataFrame geo-aware. A GeoDataFrame object can be easily created from a GeoJSON file, you can add additional data to polygons easily, and just as easily convert it back to a GeoJSON file for visualization purposes.
In this snippet to the left centroids are added to each polygon. By this, we can add a nice marker to the centroid’s location depicting information about the polygon - in this case, the district. Just as easily as this, other data can be added using a plain pandas merge. Here, income tax per capita data is added to each polygon!
The creation of the map consists of 4 important steps:
Firstly, map creation is just as easy as it seems. You should provide a starting position, a starting zoom, and a tiles argument which is responsible for the basic design of your map. Be aware, that folium expects coordinates in latitude, longitude order!
Secondly, creating the choropleth is also easy, but it requires a neatly structured GeoJSON file. The parameters of the choropleth method speak for themselves, but you can refer to the documentation if something is not clear. This creates a layer where polygons are colored according to income tax per capita data — the more the greener, the less the yellower.
Thirdly, A FeatureGroup object is created. This object consist of Marker objects signalling each district’s name and the respective income tax per capita value to give the reader exact amounts apart from the color coding from choropleth. Lastly, LayerControl is added to the map in order to make it possible to show or hide layers, such as the choropleth or the FeatureGroup layer.
Finally, the map can be saved and the created .html file opened using your browser. You can find it on my github, in the outputs folder, but here is a snippet of it:
The main takeaway here is that in creating a beautiful choropleth map — just like in any data science project — data preparation takes around 90% of the effort. We got to know OpenStreetMap data structures and the Overpass API, and solved an interesting problem in Part 1. In Part 2, using GeoDataFrames made it easier to add information to our GeoJSON files and maps. It is also clear for me, that if you are creating maps in Python, folium is the way to go. As you can see, creating a map can be a one-liner, and creating choropleth maps or showing markers with html popups are really easy with folium.

Budapest is one of my favourite cities. Had an absolutely delightful day here. I would even chuck in a few of my other blog buzz words including “beautiful”, “lovely” and “ absolutely amazing”.
What better way to start the day. I had booked a tour which could have up to 8 guests and showed up at Central Market Hall. It was $145 which was a massive stretch but honestly why not. This is an incredible building inspired by the Eiffel Tower. The Hungarian government built four of these across the city in the 1870’s after all the open air markets got infested with cockroaches and snow for most of the year.
To my incredible fortune, the mysterious Mr & Mrs Chapelle from the US were both unwell and unable to attend. Private tour baby! With portions made for 4! I steeled myself for feeling like a spoiled baby.
I now also felt no concern in asking Orsha to photograph me as her happy customer.
Over the four hours and 12 spots I was reminded just why I love food tours. The history of a people is in their food. It explains their culture, customs and sends you directly into every family’s dinner table. Hungarian food also happens to perfectly correlate with my food preferences. We are talking:
I will now give you the rundown in several loose listicle paragraphs.
Market foods were first up.
This is their street food. A donut covered in garlic juice, sour cream and a mild cheddar. How could this not be delicious.
Next up we had the salami. I tried types called horse, curly haired pig, pork cheese (has all the different bits of the animal as different cubes) and Hungarian winter. Horse weirdly tasted how I thought it would. A wild earthy flavour that made me think of riding horses.
Some of the interesting things we saw in the market include a tonne of foie gras- Hungary is one the worlds largest producers- a tonne of fat and a delicacy of a whole chicken with an egg still in it.
A benefit of being on this tour alone was that Orsha had to field all my questions. She was likely unprepared for the grilling that arrived. Some facts for you:
The pickle tasting. That is right. The Hungarians are super into pickles. I was led down several alleys to the pickle basement. Cordoned off due to its offensive fragrance. She was concerned I might not like the smell. As an amateur pickler and somebody that has hosted an actual pickle party she couldn’t have worried more pointlessly.
Enter Marika, my hero. Handmaking pickles in the basement for over 50 years.
I got to choose my very own pickle selection and try them out. Easily the best I have ever had. My favourites were the kraut and the mini watermelons.
When I get back I am going to flat out not stop until I have prepared a pickle jar with a smile on it. Look forward to Christmas presents everybody as I think a month of unemployment should just about do it.
Also coincidentally I screenshotted this yesterday. I will just leave it here.
You know what else the Hungarians are into? Deliciousness. Lunch was this sausage and goulash place. Served with oodles of cabbage and horseradish. Divine. Followed by some iced coffee and cake that I ate before taking a picture of. It started with one forkful, then quickly snowballed until both slices were gobbled up.
I learnt a bit more historical stuff from Orsha too. Something I noticed as soon as I got off the train was how decrepit all the old buildings were. I asked Orsha what was up with that.
Basically what happened was that the Hungarians sided with Germany in both world wars. Hence they had massive damage in WW2 from gunfire and allied bombing.
After WW2 Hungary lost heaps of its land and was handed to the Soviets. After that they were largely communist. The soviets converted all the rich aristocratic houses into social housing and didn’t bother to repair them for 50 years. Hence the damage on these houses is genuinely from WW2.
There was also a large wall discovered from the original Budapest boundaries recently that we strolled past.
The strangest part of the whole thing was the final portion of the tour. Wine and cheese tasting with an actual sommelier in a huge cellar. I must say this was certainly not designed for one person, and certainly not a wine noob such as myself. I laughed and sipped and enjoyed desert wine with blue cheese as I nodded along to my very own personal wine lecture. A glorious combination.
My personal sommelier had not much to say to me after I requested to try some non alcoholic wines. I was having too much fun at this time and asked him all about what he thought about them. He said simply that it was a disgrace and “grape juice”. Oh Gregor. Keep pouring em.
I strolled home after this, quite drunk and somehow lost an earring. A perfect day really. Topped up off with such a heavy nap that I fell asleep on my sunglasses and hairbrush.
Loving it here. Really coming into its own this whole “Europe” thing. The further east we are getting the more I am loving it which is promising. The fast pace is also a nice change that is making time go very fast.
Today was just great. I very clearly need to do more food tours as it is just about my favourite experience a human can have. Tired but loved today.

I knew so much, when I was living in Budapest thirty years ago. And not only a lot more Hungarian than I know today.
I knew about the national poet and revolutionary Sándor Petöfi and about playwright and author Ferenc Molnár, after whom I name the fictitious Molnár Club in Birds of Passage. I still know a bit about them, and you may know of them, too.
In 1990 I was hearing a lot of talk in our Budapest social circle about the poet and playwright János Pilinszki, who had died about 10 years earlier and was still revered. He would definitely be on my fictional playwright Gábor’s mind.
And back then I knew about Gyula Krúdy, too; I’d even seen the acclaimed 1972 Zoltán Huszárik film Szindbád based on his work. I liked the idea that down-and-out Kalliopé – my favourite character in the novel – would think so longingly of the bone soup that figures in the film.
But I’d forgotten all about Pilinszki and Krúdy by the time I was rereading Birds of Passage this spring. Their names had become as foreign to me as they may be to you. I had to Google them to figure out why I’d included them in the novel, what they add to the characterization of Gábor and Kalliopé, and how I wanted to create a sense of the Budapest cultural milieu of the time.
I had no great hopes for Birds of Passage when I was writing it, and it had become too close to me for me to see it clearly when I finished it. I was thrilled when Karen Haughian of Signature Editions (then Nuage) wanted to publish it in 1993, and surprised when the review copies she sent out included one to the Times Literary Supplement.
And I did get lots of reviews, even as an unknown and unheralded writer.
The Globe and Mail was reviewing first novels in those days, CBC Radio discussed them on air, and publications like Books in Canada (now defunct) published thoughtful pieces unimaginable today — and paid the reviewers small but useful sums for doing so. I was the cover story in Hour magazine, also long-defunct, and I was interviewed by Shelagh Rogers.
Publishing a novel is nerve-wracking, and publicising a first novel is like having ball lightning in your kitchen. The work you have been obsessing over for years is out in the world – and being read by people you know and people you don’t know. They all have opinions of it, and some will tell you what they think, and who knows what they’ll say? Most will say little, if they say anything at all, and there’s no way of knowing if that’s even worse.
And then there’ll be the reviews – and far more people will read those than ever read your book.
An awful lot depends on reviews, which is the main reason for lamenting how few there now are.
I read the reviews of Birds of Passage with trepidation and astonishment.
The Globe’s was among the first:“Leith handles emotional crisis adroitly, without being clichéd. Her prose style is observant, quick and spare.” That was okay, pretty good, really.
Speaking on “The Arts Tonight” on CBC Radio, author Antanas Sileika praised the book in extravagant terms: “If you like Milan Kundera, if you like Vaclav Havel, you’re going to love this novel.”
Books in Canada described my novel as “remarkable” and published a long and thoughtful review article:
“Because Birds of Passage is a very sophisticated book, the title cuts many ways. The various birds that inhabit apartments, tunnels, mines, and nests enrich the story without intruding on it: suggestions of freedom and confinement, of beauty and fragility, rise naturally into the narrative. Moreover, because Gabor is a writer, Leith is able to comment playfully on her own creation. The novel’s ending seemed a touch contrived, but in a book of such varied delights this is a very small quibble. Leith has the gifts of a natural storyteller.”
The Times Literary Supplement took its time (its review appeared in 1994), but was well worth the wait:
“Hungary 1990 — with dissident lives redundant after the defeat of Communism, market prices making beggars of the population and foreign feminism knocking rudely at the door — is the setting for this excellent first novel. Birds of Passage explores the tenuous relationship between a Canadian couple and their Hungarian neighbours. Linda Leith is perceptive and never sentimental about the role Hungary plays in the lives of the Canadians, Alice and Daniel.
“Across the street from them, the playwright, Gabor, a romantic, who has mostly escaped reality by living the cloak-and-dagger existence of an underground political activist, cannot settle down to domestic responsibility; his apartment is full of sparrows trapped by the closed windows.
“Leith is good on the claustrophobic, old-fashioned feel of Central Europe, with its male heroes, its sacred places and works of art which artificially perpetuate a culture shut off from the international mainstream. Hungarian men in particular are so well adapted to the cage that when released they can barely survive. Alice, who has a strong character and appalling clothes sense, is impressive. Leith has that cool, precise way with the passions that makes one think of Alison Lurie.”
I had read only one book by Alison Lurie, whom The New York Times described as a “tart-voiced novelist of manners.” I didn’t see Birds of Passage as a novel of manners, but I was delighted with my allegedly “cool, precise way with the passions.”
TLS reviews were unsigned back then, and I did wish (and I still wish) I knew who had written this. Whoever it had clearly made the acquaintance of one or two Central European men.
I also wish I’d written to these and other reviewers to tell them how much I appreciated their comments on my book. I was a novice, and I didn’t know I could do that.
Getting a great review is one of the joys of becoming a writer – but then I got a letter from an outraged Hungarian émigrée who didn’t like my book at all.
This woman sang the praises of her homeland — and heartily wished that Birds of Passage had done the same. She deplored characters in my novel that she found unsavoury, including dear Kalliopé — and protested I’d sold Hungary short.
I didn’t agree then, and I don’t agree now, for a novel is not a travel brochure, and Alison Lurie is hardly the only novelist who can be tart-voiced. As Mavis Gallant once put it, “No writer calls a truce.”
But I am grateful to this woman for her letter. Hers was the response to Birds of Passage that did most to convince me I’d done my job as a novelist.

Hansje van Halem gave an amazing and very inspiring lecture during the 8th edition of Graphifest in the Design Terminal on 11 November 2014. After her talk she was so kind and answered my questions.
It’s always good to meet a person who is so passionate and enthusiastic when it comes to talking about his/her job. Dutch graphic and book designer Hansje van Halem, who has studied at Gerrit Rietveld Academy and has been working as a freelancer since graduation, is such a person. She used to hate typography because of the rules, but since she can work freely and do experiments she introduces their wonderful creations to the world regularly.
First of all, thank you for your lecture, it was really great. You have mentioned a lot of things regarding your career so I would be interested in the beginnings now. How and when did you first meet design? Did you actually want to be a designer when you were a child?One of my first memories thinking about my future can be dated back to when I was around 8 years. It was when we were taught how to draw perspective by using a ruler; we drew lines that looked endless. I remember making those drawings and thinking: I would like to have a job where I could use a ruler. I have realised now that I have a job for which I can use a ruler as it’s about measuring and calculation.
I also remember, at some point being ten or eleven, I wanted to be a theatre or movie director. I think that also makes sense because I should make a lot of decisions and to do a lot of processing.
It also has to be mentioned that both of my parents are artists so I grew up in an environment where my father had his studio next to our house and my mother had her atelier inside the house. So I was always surrounded by people making stuff and by material and equipment. I didn’t grow up like going to museums all the time but I did grow up in an environment where if I had an idea it was okay to cut and make something. I also remember begging my father: I had a huge stack of paper, and I would beg my father if he could put it under my mother’s sewing machine. It had to be sewed in the middle, and then I folded and filled the book. Additionally, as a kid, I loved the typewriter, I used it to create books.
You also said that you hated typography, however, the Netherlands is famous for type design and letters, so I’m wondering how it was possible.I started art school when I was 19 or 20; I went to a really formal one where they said: “These are the rules, this is how you should do it. When you do it differently, you do it wrong.” Moreover, I was a kid of an artist, my mother was also a teacher in a different art school, and I knew that art/design is always about pushing boundaries, looking for differences in things. At my school they didn’t teach this way of designing, it was all about rules, and in order to do a good job you had to live up to them.
Personally, I was too afraid, I knew if I made an S, then it had to be according to the rules. Then I changed school and went to this more Bauhaus type of working with teachers like Experimental Jetset, (Good)Will Holder, Jop van Bennekom and Gerard Unger. They were all so secure of their own work, that they easily gave space to their students. They would not give you an assignment like “create an S”, but said like “do a project with numbers”. I could just loose my imagination into looking at their systems. In addition to that, I could also find the space to experiment and to find out what’s right or wrong on my own without having a teacher saying this is right and this is wrong.
Do you think education is necessary, I mean does one have to go to school to be a good graphic designer?Of course, there are people who don’t have education, but I don’t know how anyone could afford not to spend four years full-time with so many professionals dedicated to this specific topic. You can learn so much, and you can have such a great time. If you do it on your own with a job on aside, I don’t think you get this level of knowledge and practice. I wouldn’t be a graphic designer without education, as I couldn’t have learnt so much in such a short time. Of course, you learn more after school than during school but that’s not the same.
You have also mentioned that you have your studio in your apartment. Do you think it’s a good idea to have a studio in one’s home?I forgot to tell… I worked from my student room in 2003–2004. It started to feel really weird when I started to have clients over. Sometimes they would leave late to get the work finished and there would be only a short period of time between the moment when the client left and the moment when I got undressed to go to sleep. Time to get some studio space!
After having a studio for a couple of years I was fed up and moved my work space back into my (now bigger) house in 2009. That was a very productive period of two years. I took in an intern and started a gallery space in my living room showcase cabinet. But when I was sitting on the edge of my bed having dinner, I realised I needed my house back. Again, I started looking for a studio in 2011, and now I have a really nice one about 15 minutes away from my house. It’s good to have a start and a finish every day even if the day takes very long. It’s also nice that when I come home there isn’t a room full of sketches.
Do you work alone or sometimes within a group maybe?I work alone. Sometimes I need help but this is always on different levels. If I’m busy and some correction rounds need to be done regarding a book I know somebody who is more precise than I am so I just hire her. But I do everything alone basically. One of my wishes for my next life is to be a designer duo because it’s kind of lonely sometimes.
How many projects do you usually work on at the same time? I assume creating a book it’s a great amount of work.Oh, yes. It can be zero projects so I make my own stuff but it can be 5 or 7 projects at the same time. Of course, they don’t have the deadline all at once because it would be impossible to complete all the tasks, so it has to be one project starting, one waiting for reply, etc. I think I do my best when I have multiple things do to because otherwise I would start to make a big deal out of making decisions.
I’m just curious, do you use a calendar or do you know all the deadlines by heart?I keep many of them in my head, I usually know that I have a deadline next week.
How many projects are you working on right now?I am in some kind of troubles this week as I’m not working here. I’m getting a solo exhibition in Eindhoven; I’m making a spin-off of my publication, it will be 48 pages instead of 484 and it will be cheaper as well.
Yesterday I was in a supermarket in Budapest, and the printer called me and said: “We are running out of time. I’m afraid we are not gonna make it.” I was like “I’m in Budapest, I cannot do anything”. So it was a bit stressful. I was invited to design a fence for a company in Holland, which is a different thing, it’s working with material. I’m doing a poster design for a gallery located in Northern Holland. In fact, I just finished it last week, but I know there is a next one so I’ve started experimenting. This is something I do for free and I really enjoy. They always give me nice reviews. Of course, in between I make a diploma for students, and I’m working on logos for some individuals. So there are lot of stuff going on…
You work a lot. Can you stop working at some point? I’m asking because you’ve also said during your lecture that you do repetitious work in your free time.Yes, but I love watching TV as well. For the first 5 years I was working non-stop, later I realised there’ll always be work so it’s okay to take a break, it’s very normal to have weekends. There was a short period during the crisis when I was getting less money so I could not hire people and I was working during weekends, but I’m back on track now.
And finally, how do you like Budapest?For me it’s a cultural shock. I was just getting on the plane as it was taking a train to another city in Holland but getting out of the plane I had to realise this is not Holland. I didn’t really have time to think about being here, though. Today I was walking around, and first you go to the tourist layer and looking all the windows, but then I was taken to the House of Terror, which, of course, changes perspectives. You get the contrast between all the beautiful, decorated ceilings you could see in the buildings and this horrible history… And you meet nice people as well. I’ve been here for 30 hours maybe so I cannot say so much but it’s very intriguing.
You should come back later on!I’m going to treat my mother on a weeklong holiday in Budapest. I’m just thinking of stuff what we should do.
By the way, do you know anything about Hungarian graphic design?Only what I’ve seen on Graphifest, and, of course, I’be been looking around in the city as for graphic design it’s very important to get a platform, a space to show design. I’m just wondering what the operation spaces of Hungarian designers are.
They usually open a studio…Yes, but I mean in the street. I’ve seen posters but I don’t think those are designed by those people. Maybe different types of agencies…
There is an exhibition called ARC that has a theme every year, for instance.Yes, but for me exhibitions are designs for designers, however, designers should also meet clients who will hire them. Right now my problem is who will hire me, I might be invited to more exhibitions than for work. It’s lovely that people appreciate what you are doing and want to hang and show your work to other people but you need to make a living as well.
Do you think it should be offline, I’m just wondering, because you can be hired based on your portfolio on Behance/website, for example?I think your work should be everywhere. I’m on Cargo Collective because it has a gallery system so every time I do something I can put them in the front row. I get clients from there, and also from Instagram.
I don’t know how people did it before because when I graduated there was no Facebook or Tumblr, people did have websites but I have no idea how they did it. There were a lot of requests for portfolio books, though. There was always a book being published, and an art director called you that he/she wanted you in that book. Exposure is very important. I also have friends and colleagues who have maximum exposures but no paid assignments. So they get invited to Japan, for example, but nobody calling them saying: “Hello, we have some money, can you create something for us?” It would be nice to be found by an agent or something. I can see on Instagram that an agency is following me and I’m thinking: Oh, interesting, maybe they want me.

Reading scripts. Absolutely critical to learn the craft of screenwriting. The focus of this weekly series is a deep structural and thematic analysis of each script we read. Our daily schedule:
Monday: Scene-By-Scene BreakdownTuesday: Major Plot PointsWednesday: SequencesThursday: Psychological JourneyFriday: Takeaways
Today: Major Plot Points.
In every scene, something happens. A plot point is a scene or group of scenes in which something major happens, an event that impacts the narrative causing it to turn in a new direction.
A relevant anecdote. Years ago, I was on the phone with a writer discussing a script project. My son Will, who was about four years old at the time, must have been listening to me talking about “plot points” during the conversation because after I hung up, he asked, “Daddy, what’s a plop point?”
That’s in effect what a plot point is. It’s an event that ‘plops’ into the narrative and changes its course. So when you think Plot Point, think Plop Point!
The value of this exercise:
* To identify the backbone of the story structure.
* To examine each major plot point and see how it is effective as an individual event.
* To analyze the major plot points in aggregate to determine why they work together as the central plot.
This week: The Grand Budapest Hotel. You may download the script — free and legal — here: The Grand Budapest Hotel.
Screenplay by Wes Anderson, story by Wes Anderson & Hugo Guinness, inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig
IMDb plot summary: The adventures of Gustave H, a legendary concierge at a famous hotel from the fictional Republic of Zubrowka between the first and second World Wars, and Zero Moustafa, the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend.
Writing Exercise: Go through the scene-by-scene breakdown of The Grand Budapest Hotel and identify the major plot points. Post your thoughts in comments and we’ll see if we can come up with a consensus.
For Part 1, to read the Scene-By-Scene Breakdown created by Rob Hoskins, go here.
Tomorrow we consider the script’s structure in terms of its sequences.
If you’d like a PDF of The Grand Budapest Hotel, script scene-by-scene breakdown, go here.
Major kudos to Rob Hoskins for doing this week’s breakdown.
Tomorrow: We focus on the sequences in the script.
This series started here and we have 26 volunteers to do scene-by-scene breakdowns of contemporary movie scripts. The scripts we have already analyzed are in italics.

For new volunteers and those who have already volunteered, but not sent me a breakdown yet, please do so as soon as possible. Thanks!
Circling back to where we started, reading scripts is hugely important. Analyzing them even more so. If you want to work in Hollywood as a writer, you need to develop your critical analytical skills. This is one way to do that.
So seize this opportunity and join in the conversation!
I hope to see you in comments about this week’s script: The Grand Budapest Hotel.Comment Archive

Budapest is Hungary’s capital and largest city. It is by far the most visited city in the country, with millions of tourists landing every year. It also happens to be one of my most favorite cities. That being said, I am a traveler and not a tourist.
As such, every time I plan to travel, the idea is to go beyond the usual. In the case of Hungary, it is no different. Every occasion I venture out to this beautiful European country, I behave very unlike me. I make at least a couple of impromptu decisions during every vacation, and this attitude has helped me explore a lot of the country. This trip was no different.
For starters, on this occasion, I had not landed in Budapest and planned further. Instead, I was on my way to the hitherto unexplored western part of Hungary, having flown in to neighboring Austria. While I landed at Vienna, it was not going to be my base for the next few days. On the contrary, I had towards Sopron.
In the eight days that followed, I ended up exploring Sopron, Szombathely, Kőszeg and the surrounding countryside in the Győr-Moson-Sopron County and the Vas County. All the cities I ended up visiting also have a German name. So it is Ödenburg for Sopron…

I’m well aware that we don’t all rewatch films at the same time. We are all subject to individual whims that diverge and intersect largely at random. That said, I do think that in the near future many of us will be rewatching Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel.
This prediction is based on several factors: the impending release of Anderson’s new film The Phoenician Scheme, a renewed (or perhaps wholly original) fondness for Ralph Fiennes following his performance in Conclave, and the general critical consensus that The Grand Budapest Hotel represents the culmination of Anderson’s artistic vision. Essentially, if we’re due for a Wes Anderson rewatch, this will be the film a good 75–80% of participants will pick.
It’s my belief that when people do return to it, they’ll find the same thing I found during my recent rewatch. It’s better now than it was the first time. Why? Because time is a flat circle and our moral dilemmas have a habit of resurfacing in new disguises.
Viewers noted from the film’s release that one of its key themes was the rise of fascism. What I think we lacked in 2014 was an understanding of fascism as a recurring threat rather than one that was just as much an article of the past as the Grand Budapest itself. Sure, we could link the film’s commentary on the treatment of immigrants to ongoing crises in the world, but we didn’t see fascist militaries boarding trains and demanding visas. We saw… logistical challenges.
This political inattentiveness at the time of the film’s release contributed to a chronic misinterpretation of the two protagonists. Primarily, critics were prone to forgetting there were, in fact, two protagonists.
Readers may have noticed my use of the pronoun “we” up to this point when making my points. The “we” I am referring to are fellow white beneficiaries of the imperial core. To those reading who do not fit into that category, my apologies, but you’ll see the utility in a moment.
Our greatest failing when initially addressing The Grand Budapest Hotel at the time of its release, was to center our attentions almost entirely on M. Gustave for analysis. He is by all means a fascinating character with many aspects to pick apart and discuss; however, his function in the narrative is to serve as a catalyst and foil for our true central character, Zero.
The Grand Budapest Hotel is presented in layers, a trick Anderson has become quite fond of if his more recent film Asteroid City is any indication. The film opens on a young girl reading a book next to the grave of the book’s author, who awaits us in the next layer to detail a story from his youth, where in the next layer he meets with the aging proprietor of a hotel far past its prime situated in the fictional alpine nation of Zubrowka, and in the final layer where most of the film takes place, the proprietor recounts his time as a lobby boy at the hotel. By all accounts, the narrator and arbiter of style for most of the film is Zero (or at least the image of Zero his older self conveys to the author).
Like many of Anderson’s films, this one concerns itself with nostalgia for bygone eras. This nostalgia textures the memory of previous times to such a degree that they become more of a fantastical setting than a true reflection of the past, putting a pair of rose-tinted glasses on for the audience. Against the backdrop of a pastel 1930s Europe, we’re confronted with a group of characters who deliberately clash with it. While the staff of The Grand Budapest and the other members of the Society of Crossed Keys all stand out with vivid color, they are contrasted by the setting’s rising fascist movement dressed entirely in monochrome.
A common criticism I’ve found of Anderson’s work is that he prioritizes style over substance, that his chief concern is the aesthetic coherence of an auteur rather than the merit of his narratives. While in some cases this may be fair, what my rewatch of The Grand Budapest Hotel illustrated for me is that to measure style against substance is to create a false dichotomy. That is because, in this film style elucidates substance, substance that in 2014 we were perhaps less primed to recognize.
The rosiness of The Grand Budapest’s past and the whimsical absurdity of its inhabitants are the product of Zero’s recollection, because at this point in his life the hotel may as well be a fairyland compared to what came before. We learn later in the film, following a frustrated outburst from Gustave that gives way to a host of xenophobic insults, that Zero came to Zubrowka from an unnamed Arab country going through a state of political turmoil. He fled after witnessing the execution of his entire family and the lingering threat from the encroaching fascist army will mean death for him, should they choose to deport him.
While most reviews of the film at its release were positive, the few notable criticisms were leveled against the plot, some saying it felt nonsensical and unconnected to any broader theme. And when you view the film with Gustave as its true protagonist, the criticism makes sense. However, when you consider the film from Zero’s perspective, there’s an obvious logic as to why he would focus on patently silly events and madcap drama. To him, these are the good times. Times when he had his mentor and wife with him, when the fascists were a distant presence that only occasionally menaced him, and he had a home that filled him with a sense of purpose. This is the story he wishes to tell.
In the narrative layer where he speaks with the author, the now dilapidated Grand Budapest is the last vestige of that former life Zero still possesses. He explains that he maintains it not in memory of Gustave, who embodied the hotel’s spirit and ultimately bequeathed it to him, but in memory of his wife Agatha. This was the place they were happy together, however short that time may have been. The utility of memory is such that by sharing it we allow ourselves to be better understood.
We made the mistake of assuming fascism was included in the movie to emphasize that theme of memory, that is was a thing of the past that poked a hole in an otherwise happy period, but we also presumed that the only associations with it that mattered are our own. It is easier for us to relate to Gustave, because like him, our confrontations with fascist oppression are taken on by choice. Even with the added context that some of us, like Gustave, are queer and have that as a potential target on our backs, our existences are not constantly hounded by fascist dogma in the same way those of immigrants and refugees are.
While Zero’s growth over the course of the film is defined by him establishing himself as an integral part of the Grand Budapest’s community, Gustave’s arc centers his developing awareness of his own privilege and the value of his relationships with others. He comes to understand that there are ways to relate to others beyond providing a service.
The scene that I find most striking ten years later is a scene shot entirely in monochrome. It is an echo of an earlier scene and an escalation of the film’s color language. The fascist army boards the train and enters the train car occupied by Gustave, Zero, and Zero’s wife Agatha. They request the travelers’ papers, though this time with a heavier threat hanging over their heads should they produce the wrong kind of papers. Zero pulls out a wrinkled and ripped work visa, which Gustave confirms the legitimacy of and even produces a card from a commander in the fascist army indicating they should be allowed to pass. The fascist army members do not accept this. And Gustave, as the author is told by an older Zero, gave his life trying to ensure Zero’s safe passage. What precisely happened to Zero and Agatha in the two years between Gustave’s death and the death of Agatha and her child is left ambiguous, but one can presume they were not happy times.
It is easy for things to become commonplace which would have been unthinkable just a few years prior. We now live in a version of the US confident in its power to harass, detain, and deport immigrants on a whim. We have people boarding our trains and asking for our documents at this very moment. What The Grand Budapest Hotel wants us to realize is that we have a duty to the person sitting next to us. It can be easy to allow injustices to pass us by due to relative distance, to cling to a veneer of civility and not make a fuss.
Perhaps the most insidious misinterpretation of the film is that Gustave is a good man because of his civility, that his politeness brings him karmic rewards because he does not discriminate in who he is polite to. The aforementioned scene refutes this assertion, bookmarked in black and white so the audience takes care to remember. Gustave was a good man because he knew when to take action, and he gained that knowledge through his friendship with Zero. If his strength is his civility, then true civility must include a refusal to sit by and allow harm to come to the people around you.
The Grand Budapest Hotel is a better film now in 2025 than it was at release, because present political circumstances make it far more difficult for us to miss the point. Zero was always the heart of the story, his attachment to the hotel always in relation to how it provided a home for him rather than a vocation. It is only now that we begin to develop the consciousness to understand these things outside of our own privileged experience. It is no longer possible to ignore.
We feel the weight of the world of memory Anderson presents more keenly now because we have lost the benefit of distance from the time it represents.

They say there are two types of people in Budapest, those who live in Buda and those who want to live in Buda.
Well, after my first trip to this stunning city with my high school best friend, Kat, I can see why. Buda, with its rolling hills and picturesque skyline, is undeniably the prettier side of the Danube, but I quickly fell for both Buda and Pest.
There’s a certain magic to the way the two sides blend, separated by the wide, winding river but bound together by history and charm.
From the moment we arrived, we were swept up in Budapest’s grandeur. The architecture alone felt like it was trying to impress us. It succeeded. Every street corner seemed to shout, “Look at me! I’m outrageously elegant!” with good reason.
The city is a feast for the eyes, with its majestic buildings, intricate monuments, and statues that could rival those in any European capital.

🏩✨A number of years ago, upon writing this review, we had decided to spend the tenth day of August in the spa town of Nebelsbad below the Alpine Sudetenwaltz — and had taken up rooms in the Grand Budapest — a picturesque, elaborate, and a still widely-celebrated establishment. 🗓📝🏔We expect some of you will know it. 🌸🎟
After boarding the LFC Express, we have finally arrived at our destination: The Grand Budapest Hotel, with the Buda-best service, Mr. Gustave- approved! Read our review as we reminisce on this classic cinematic masterpiece!

Wes Anderson’s ‘The Grand Budapest Hotel’ is well positioned to win some Oscars on Sunday. It received nine Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Picture. The film’s editing has received widespread praise and Editor Barney Pilling is nominated in that category (his first Oscar nomination). Pilling’s work on ‘Budapest’ also recently won him an ACE Eddie Award for Best Edited Feature, Comedy/Musical. Pilling’s past projects include ‘An Education,’ ‘Never Let Me Go,’ and ‘One Day.’ He’s currently working on ‘Suffragette’ starring Meryl Streep and Helena Bonham Carter.
Here’s our Q&A on ‘The Grand Budapest Hotel’:
What inspired you to become an editor?
I’ve always loved watching films throughout my life and I’ve always had a creative drive…but I’d have to say that the sci-fi and war films of my childhood really fired my imagination in a way that little else did and probably set the foundation for a life of make-believe. ‘Star Wars,’ Spielberg, ‘Bladerunner,’ ‘2001 A Space Odyssey,’ ‘Alien,’ ‘Guns of Navarone,’ ‘Where Eagles Dare,’ ‘Bridge on the River Kwai’ and so on.
What’s it like to work on a Wes Anderson film?
It’s incredibly hard work and truly exhilarating, all at the same time! It’s also a privilege for me to work with so many outstanding craftspeople and performers.
What were the biggest challenges with editing the film?
Probably pulling in so many elements from so many different sources, studios and countries for the action pieces. We had green screen main unit, miniature model and landscape builds in Berlin, stop motion puppetry happening in London, and Look FX tinkering away in LA — so pulling all this into focus with the right rhythm was a long and tough process. Also technically really demanding of the editorial team and the Avid Software — many, many video layers!
Both you and your wife are in the business. Do you discuss work at home?
Yes! Lots. It’s hard not too. You have to be very passionate about what you are doing to succeed in the TV and Film industry, so it’s difficult to switch it off at home. Also, we end up being first audiences of our respective projects — bouncing things off each other — it’s nice.
Could you see yourself working with Wes Anderson again?
I hope so! I’m incredibly proud of the work we all did on that ‘Grand Budapest Hotel’ and have become close friends with many of my fellow craftspeople. These are feelings and relationships that of course anyone would want to repeat or perpetuate.

I have been pretty inactive on social media in the past few weeks because my phone was stolen while I was traveling in Budapest, Hungary. Losing your phone is very inconvenient in this day and age, when so much activity and business has moved to mobile platforms. Not having Google maps in my palm made navigation a bit more cumbersome, and many of my plane tickets and travel information were on my phone. I also couldn’t look up different restaurants to go and compare the reviews. Worst of all, I was cut off from the rest of the world as I couldn’t access my emails, texts, phone calls, social media, etc.
My first impression of Budapest was very positive. I liked how traditional Budapest is compared to other big cities in Europe, and the Hungarian culture is alive and thriving in this city. Many of the restaurants were over a hundred years old, serving traditional Hungarian cuisine the same way they had for centuries. There was a wide variety of meats, including goose, venison (deer meat), wild boar, duck, rabbit, etc., which I really appreciated because those types of meats are relatively rare in America and Western Europe, where people usually just eat chicken, beef, or pork for their protein. Moreover, prices in general were a lot lower in Budapest, although the exchange rate was pretty confusing because 1 US dollar is almost 300 Hungarian Forints (289.22 as of July 14, 2019). I…

October has always been my favorite month, filled with happiness, and fun, and began of the festival. But this October, we planned to do something different, So We decided to take our vacation to Budapest. We did not take a single vacation break this year which made us do something different, to feel like we did something this year apart from work or regular life.
Budapest the capital city of Hungary, is a town rich with history, beautiful breathtaking architecture, and unforgettable experiences.
But this trip was different from any other trip we had before because we ticked off one of the most thrilling items on our bucket list: skydiving.
I’ve always been drawn to the idea of flying, but nothing could prepare me for the rush of actually leaping from a plane at 10,000 feet. The sensation was beyond words. Budapest, with its stunning landscapes, became the perfect backdrop for…

We were awakened in the middle of the night on our European River Cruise by a loud noise, a shaking of the boat from left to right and back to left again, and the closet light flashing on and off as the door spontaneously opened and banged shut.
“What was that?” I asked my husband as I grabbed his arm. He looked out our glassed-in French Balcony. “We’re in a lock,” he said. “The boat must have hit the side of it.”
Within minutes, we were back to sleep. We had our safety drill early in the trip and no sirens went off nor was any announcement made — whatever it was, lock or no lock, we were safe.
When we planned our vacation traversing Europe on three iconic rivers — the Danube, Rhine, and Main — we had no idea we’d pass through so many locks.

Wes Anderson’s “The Grand Budapest Hotel” is colorful, quirky and almost surreal.
Behind Anderson’s detailed world is Marquette alumnus Adam Stockhausen, Comm ‘95.
Director Wes Anderson and Stockhausen looked at old hotels and other eastern European buildings to create the invented country of Zubrowka.
“The Grand Budapest Hotel” received nine Oscar nominations and won four of them.
Stockhausen took home his first Oscar for production design. He shares this award with set designer Anna Pinnock.

He graduated from Marquette in 1995 with a degree in theater.
“He has that ability to wrap his mind around stuff and to get so engrossed in things that it really turns out some wonderful stuff,” Marquette Theatre Artistic director Debra Krajec told Fox6 News.
Stockhausen is the first Marquette graduate to win an Academy Award since Dom Ameche won for Best Supporting Actor in 1986.
Stochkausen was previously nominated for his work in the 2012 film “12 Years a Slave.” He has already worked on two films since “The Grand Budapest Hotel.”

The city smelled of days’ worn clothes. Streets are littered with piss stains, cigarette butts and small piles of dog shit. Budapest features a rich history, the majesty of time immemorial is written into ornate buildings riddled with bullet holes, and in somber pockmarked faces of passerbys. Ambulances in a foreign language squeal in the distance, like a whining dog. Trams charge up and murmur in electric tongues. Dark-haired people with thin lips and absent eyes mix into the landscape.
I get the sense of an underlying hardship, that people are struggling (later confirmed by talking with locals). Maybe it’s winter malady, absent of snow and joy. The only people laughing loudly are the tourists, who are everywhere; Flaunting their unburdened spirit, unbridled by work or school or obligations (here on holiday for cheap thrills). To walk down the sidewalk is to island hop between unrecognizable dialects. You know a tourist by: Loud chittering dispersed amid large flocks with cocked heads; raised eyes and abrupt stops to review digital maps; movement that is too fast or slow for the pace of the street.
I’m not sure what I was looking for in my trip, and I wouldn’t say that I’ve “learned about myself” or “grown” per se. I would like to continue streaking away from a traditional career in America; I want to let go of the rope on the bunny slope. I don’t desire being different as a matter of course, but simply following others is not the way towards individuation.
I do seek: Authenticity. As Dōgen, a Japanese Buddhist priest, writer, poet, philosopher, and founder of the Sōtō school of Zen in Japan, said, “We study the self to forget the self. When you forget the self, you can become one with the ten thousand things.” And as the Buddah proclaimed, “kill the Buddah.” Or, your ultimate goal is to make your own way. Guides, inspiration, models offer signposts, but the landscape is vast and inherently unique for each person; I intend to get off the trail, even if I need to come back and follow the blazes from time to time.
Towards the end of his life, Carl Jung stated that our greatest adventure today is in the exploration of our unconscious. Everything else is a distraction; to know ourselves is more important, meaningful, and challenging than say, colonizing Mars — while I appreciate the pursuit it seems more like an act of running away from the real meaning here on Earth (and from within ourselves).
In the Western world, we live in a culture of (inter-)connection in the form of: sociability and social networks; emails and Twitter streams; a prizing of extraversion; boredom and distraction. And yet loneliness is both ubiquitous and a condemnation. Jung would classify this as the Shadow of our collective Ego, because consciousness exists for individuals and societies, and we are very good at denying ourselves and each other at scale. To deny your Self is to empower the Shadow, which is the root for maladies of the human personality.
Tidying things up: In a world with excess information most of us are sponges, super-saturated with no spare volume for our own understanding… what would happen if we were all suddenly wrung dry?
AARON GERRY tries not to take himself too seriously, despite what the content may suggest. He enjoys pen and paper, perambulating, and donuts. Many donuts. Oh and writing. Speaking of which, his work can be found in journals and publications such as Chronogram, Lit Up, P.S. I Love You, The Creative Cafe, The Junction, and others. If you like this piece please do 👏clap👏 along!

Wes Anderson’s “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” released in 2014, is a cinematic masterpiece that defies categorization. With its distinctive visual style, quirky characters, and intricate narrative structure, the film takes audiences on a whimsical journey through a world that is both charmingly surreal and emotionally resonant. As a testament to Anderson’s unique directorial vision, “The Grand Budapest Hotel” has left an indelible mark on the world of cinema.
A Visual Delight
From the moment the film begins, viewers are enveloped in a visually enchanting universe that could only have sprung from the mind of Wes Anderson. The movie’s meticulously crafted set designs, intricate color palettes, and meticulously arranged compositions create a mesmerizing experience. The Grand Budapest Hotel itself, with its pink façade and ornate interiors, serves as both a central character and a metaphor for the film’s whimsical allure.
Anderson’s keen attention to detail extends beyond the set design. The use of miniatures and practical effects adds a layer of tangible magic to the story, transporting the audience to a realm that feels both nostalgic and otherworldly. Each frame is a work of art, and the film’s distinctive visual style is as much a character as any of the actors.
An Ensemble of Eccentric Characters
At the heart of “The Grand Budapest Hotel” is an ensemble cast that brings the film’s eccentric characters to life with remarkable depth and charisma. The inimitable Ralph Fiennes leads the pack as the charismatic and witty concierge, Monsieur Gustave H. His magnetic performance adds a layer of charm and complexity to the character, making him simultaneously hilarious and heartwarming.
The supporting cast is equally impressive, with memorable performances from Saoirse Ronan, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Tilda Swinton, Jeff Goldblum, and many others. Each character, no matter how minor, contributes to the film’s rich tapestry, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.
A Narrative Maze
What sets “The Grand Budapest Hotel” apart is its intricate narrative structure. The film unfolds as a story within a story within a story, skillfully weaving together different timelines and perspectives. This layered approach not only keeps the audience engaged but also deepens the emotional resonance of the film.
The narrative structure is further enhanced by the film’s playful tone and dark humor. Anderson effortlessly transitions between moments of slapstick comedy and poignant introspection, creating a balance that keeps the audience emotionally invested while never taking itself too seriously.
Themes of Nostalgia and Loss
Beneath the film’s whimsy and humor lies a profound exploration of themes such as nostalgia, loss, and the passage of time. Through the character of Zero Moustafa (played by F. Murray Abraham and Tony Revolori), the audience witnesses the changing landscape of Europe and the hotel’s decline from its glamorous heyday. This melancholic undercurrent adds depth to the film, reminding us that even the most fantastical worlds are not immune to the effects of time.
Conclusion
“The Grand Budapest Hotel” is a cinematic gem that continues to captivate audiences with its unique blend of visual artistry, quirky characters, and intricate storytelling. Wes Anderson’s directorial vision shines through in every frame, creating a world that feels simultaneously nostalgic and fresh. The film’s ability to evoke laughter, wonder, and introspection is a testament to its enduring appeal. As we revisit the charming corridors of the Grand Budapest Hotel, we are reminded that, in the world of cinema, true magic knows no bounds.

A book that made me book a flight to Budapest. I guess it was one of the best decisions. Right now, crying here in “Vinikli” while enjoying Hungarian wine, still feeling so happy that I am here. Thank you Magda Szabó.
Oh, my heart. This book is why I’m sitting here in Budapest, crying my eyes out as I read the final pages. What a story… my heart is shattered into pieces. My dear Etelka. My dear Iza.
My journey with Hungarian literature began with Sándor Márai’s Portraits of a Marriage, which remains one of my favorite books. But this one, written by the talented Magda Szabó, is just as incredible. Reading the final pages in the very place where it all unfolded is truly a magical experience.
In Etelka, I saw so much of my own mother, and in the things Iza did thinking she was helping her mother, but slowly, unintentionally causing her to wither like a flower, I unfortunately found myself in her.
After my family lost their first child, perhaps because I am the only child my family had later in life, I empathized with the book deeply — I’m not sure — but it touched me profoundly. I felt an incredible sense of regret for every time I was unsympathetic toward my mother. At the same time, just like Etelka, Iza’s life was also changed, and I can truly relate to the turmoil and confusion she went…

Budapest is the capital and this was my second time here. This time the stay was in Hotel Danubius Helia at the Karpat Utca, on the banks of river Danubius. You get a view of Margaret island from the hotel rooms. I visited the island on the Day 1 evening, people usually go there for jogging, having alcohol at the restaurant, watching the ruins. There is also a presedved bio diversity, a few animals kept in there covered from all sides.
I took a walking tour on the second day and they take you through: the Parliament, American Embassy, Heroes square, Ruin Bars, the Jewish synagogue
Its a very small country in the Central Europe, part of which also meets the Adriatic Sea in the south. Almost any part can be reached in a couple of hours from the capital: Ljubljana. If compared, the country must be smaller than Indian state Madhya Pradesh.
Unlike rest of the European countries, the capital doesn’t have Tram trains and Subways as public transport. You can only use the local buses. In fact if you’re a tourist, every tourist spot can be covered by walk. Its all within a square kilometer from the main bus station. Preseren Square, Ljubljana castle, Dragon Bridge, National & University Library, Restaurants, Market are the only places that can be visited or are a must visit. You won’t find Starbucks, Subway, KFC et cetera here in the capital. Luckily, we have McD, Pizza Hut, at least for the Vegetarians.
25 minutes of walk to the castle, mostly climbing, you get a very beautiful view of the city from the top. There are multiple entries and exits at the bottom where you can start your climbing. You can also take a Funicular railway for a return ticket of 6 Euros, to avoid walking. I preferred walking because thats what I’ve been doing since last 6 days perhaps to save a few Euros for the remaining tour. I’ve started liking to walk (a lot) now a days. You’ll see a bunch of private restaurants, pretty costly too, on the top part of the castle. This part, privatization at the world heritage sites, I really hate it.
Bled is a beautiful town 55 kimoleters away from the capital. Arriva is the transport company here which takes you there with a good frequency of buses, for every half an hour, charging 13 Euros for return. I had planned for only 1 day for Bled unknowing of its charm. One can spend like a week here if you plan to see it thoroughly. There’s a lake in the middle of the town with a small island which has a church. People usually take local ferries to reach there, the charge is 15 Euros for return. Its a wooden boat and the person ferrying us has to row using the oars in both hands, sounds like bit of a stamina work, right? To add to that, there were around 16 people on the boat.
Vintgar Klamm is a place from where you can start your walk through gorge, to the waterfall alongside the picturesque Radovna river. 2 Euros for a return ticket by bus from Bled and about 30 minutes to reach.
Its a beautiful walk with cold breezes and lushy green forest. You can also go near the water, drink it, sit there for some time unless you are making any risky move.
For solo travellers or not tourists, who do not want to spend a lot on stay, I would suggest booking Turn Hostel in Mala Ulica near the main bus station which is 5 minutes walking distance. They charge around 25 Euros per night plus 3 Euros environment tax. Also all tourist places in Ljubljana are at a walking distance.
After the beautiful trip of Slovenia, I then took a bus from the main bus station of Ljubljana to Marburg where I’ll be meeting my brother in law. It was a 17 hours of journey by Bus, I had booked a Flixbus through their app, it costed me 53 Euros. The bus was scheduled at 21:05.
The bus was a double decker Flixbus and it was running late by an hour as it had started from Zagreb. To my surprise, Buses in Europe run late too. I hadn’t booked a specific seat number, so boarded and searched for the best available seat for me on the upper half. It doesn’t matter to be seated in last seats in European countries as the roads and speed breakers are smooth enough. More importantly, buses are comparatively comfortable too. I got a window seat exactly above the rear tyre set. It was a semi sleeper and the journey was for the entire night. Phew!!
It reached on time to the Frankfurt bus station at around 9:00 am and I had a connecting bus at 11:00 am to Marburg. I walked in to a nearby hotel to enquire for using the washroom. 1 Euro was the charge. I quickly refreshed myself, enquired for the coffee at the reception but unfortunately they didn’t serve only coffee, I needed to take the entire buffet which I was not in the mood to. I decoded to take a walk around the bus station, it was a big place, with many shops, hotels, tram stations et cetera. I could even see an Indian restaurant across the road, but it would only open after I take my bus to Marburg.
“I don’t know where I’m going but I’m on my way”
Trip Route:
Mumbai — Vienna — Budapest — Ljubljana — Bled — Ljubljana— Marburg — Munich — Vienna — Mumbai

UPDATE: This is a fairly old article, since the 2015 instagram update various aspect ratios are allowed to upload, from 1.91:1 to 1:1 hooray for cinematographers and directors like Reed Morano or Emmanuel Lubezki. But that doesn’t mean this article is of no use, all the contrary, the quick lessons within still apply if you want to give that somewhat classic look to your instagram account, much better if you like the squared ratio photos, like many photographers of the minimalist style wave do.
Those who saw “The Grand Budapest Hotel” can agree with me that it was marvelous in many aspects: Oscar worthy direction, scenarios, music and many others. But for now, i’m writing about his cinematography/ photography direction by the hand of Robert D. Yeoman and how he and the movie can make you a better instagrammer.
When I just finished watching it for the first time, at the moment the credits were rolling I realized that the movie itself is, in a way, an awesome and inspiring example of Instagram photography.
The frames were composed with such taste and detail that the first thing I say to my friends about the movie is that “It’s visually incredible”; and perhaps, some part of that beauty it’s because of the unusual (almost squared) 1.37:1 aspect ratio used on most of the length of the film.
That unusual look gave the movie that 30's vintage film look that I found absolutely beautiful and, in fact, it’s very Instagram-like.
Note that Instagram uses a 1:1 Squared aspect ratio, not 1.37:1, but between 1.37:1 and 1:1 there isn’t a lot difference.
The following are some examples of the key aspects I was able to absorb from the movie.
The Grand Budapest Hotel teaches us that keeping in mind the frame when composing is the key, every line, every element and just about everything is in the tone and fits perfectly on his aspect ratio. (look at the courtains in the example or the columns in the first picture)
One of the primary reasons that most people post bad photos on Instagram is that they not compose their photos thinking “squared”, they aren’t thinking in 1:1 ratio, some people just take the pictures, as usual, in the aspect ratio the camera app is set (usually 2:3 or 16:9), forgetting the composition, and later they crop the photo in Instagram, well, that’s a mistake. Use an app like VSCO cam, the square guide feature within the app is meant for Instagram users, it helps a lot.
“Always think 1:1”
It’s all about giving your subject his space, the movie does this perfectly, sometimes with flat backgrounds, brighter backgrounds and not making the subject to absorb the entire frame.
Make it simple
Sometimes there will be a trashcan or a chair that will come out on your way, disbalancing your shot, and the best way to treat this is simply moving them away to have a better and cleaner composition. Or you can incorporate them to become a part of your shot, as I explain in the next point.
One thing I found curious, specially in this shot, is the fact that all the elements in the movie are in a certain position and place that it almost feels painted.
The movie with that single shot tells us a story, some kind of manhunt or investigation. Well, that’s what a great photo achieves, to make the public imagine the reason of every element on the shot.
Tell a story with your elements
Just arrange the objects to give balance to your shot. And as the example shot shows: A little dramatic light always help.
This is actually very trendy among the photography and design community, but i’m not aware of the name of the trend, if you know it please leave me a note →
This one is the key aspect to make your photos look like the work of a pro (while you become one). The movie gave special attention to achieve symmetry to their shots. Perhaps that’s the main aspect I loved about The Grand Budapest Hotel (visually speaking), and the reason that lead me to write this article.
Make your shot stable, be sure your camera is completely vertical or horizontal and look for guides to help you give symmetry to your shot (Look at how the black tiles at the example helps to center the shot.)
Take your time
I suggest not to tilt your photos. I’ve seen very few pics on Instagram that work with a tilted crooked angle, the 1:1 aspect ratio pairs better with a flat horizon line. So, unless you’re absolutely conviced that the tilted angle will work, try to avoid it.The symmetry is the best friend of the aspect I explain next.
This is the ultimate “cheat” to make your squared Instagram photos look awesome. The cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman without a doubt loves the perspectives and we have the joy to experience many scenes like this one in the movie. (Similar to the Stanley Kubrick style)
This style draws your attention into the picture, creates movement in it and, virtually commands you to pay attention to the subject.
Give movement to your shot
The lines are everything. Take the example shot as a simple guide. Corridors, bridges or train tracks are ideal scenarios; make your perspective lines go to the corners of the frame, make it symmetrical (as I explained in the previous point); put one main subject at the center of the frame (max two subjects); and simply enjoy the moment. You’ll see the results. Your photos are gonna get a lot of ❤ on Instagram.
Now it’s up to you. Watch the movie, get inspired, follow this path and start shooting, you’re gonna love all of it.
Please, don’t get me wrong, i’m not saying this is the only way to shine at Instagram, but it’s certainly a beautiful path.
Here are some real examples of successful instagrammers of this style, follow them for an extra dose of inspiration. I II III IV V (I love the third one)
Thank you for reading!
This is my very first article and if you recommend it that will mean a lot to me. Let me know if you liked it. ☺Apologies if something is misspelled, I’m not very fluent at english.Share this article wherever you like. Thanks.

Overwhelming, volatile, passionate, affectionate, dependable and adoring.
Her emotions, like a wild storm gathering on a calm horizon, erupt without warning, casting doubt on my capacity and worth as a parent.
Despite our frequent squabbles, my teenage daughter approached me in October with travel plans for Fall break that felt more like a polished closing argument in a presidential debate. She artfully outlined her reasons for the trip, highlighted how it could strengthen our bond, and delivered a persuasive appeal for me to step away from my relentless 9-to-5 grind — stirring a sense of intrigue and the promise of much-needed relaxation.
It left a mark that lingered in my thoughts, pulling me in until I finally gave in.
A few weeks later, we were soaring above the clouds, Budapest-bound, carried by the thrill of reconnecting with old friends.
We touched down just past midnight, stepping into Budapest’s deserted streets, where every shadow seemed to echo the 12 years, I once called this city home. Meanwhile, I rehearsed the apartment code like a sacred verse, fearing my dead phone would turn this arrival into a pilgrimage of memory.

In Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel, the moments of absurdity are essential to understanding the humanity of the story and how our relationships with others are what defines our lives. Anderson is sure to never spend too long on one tragic moment alone and tends to bundle emotion, comedy, and danger together in a scene. These moments of comedy act as a device to distance the viewer from the dark realities of the story and are key to making the film enjoyable instead of altogether sad.
From the moment the film starts, we are distanced from the story. We see a young girl visit a tribute to the author of our tale, who then discusses the true story of his book as it was told to him by Zero in his later years. We are quickly aware of the lenses we are seeing the story through and the fact that it is a story. It is through the form of a story that we can pay attention to the greater themes that are discussed about the world and the relationships that develop.
When Gustave receives news of Madame D., he immediately heads off to the funeral, and abruptly takes Zero with him. “We must go to her.” “We must?” “She needs me, and I need you to help me with my bags and so on.” Although this is the way in which he asks Zero to go with him and has him pack wine and his bag for him, it becomes clear that Gustave wants to have someone by his side. Like Zero, Gustave is alone in this world and has no one else that he would trust to go with him. Gustave clearly feels a strong bond with Zero early on and treats him as a friend once they are outside the hotel, but Zero does not feel that same way immediately. Gustave pours him wine (which Zero does not drink) and plans that if things were to go south, they should run away together. Gustave even chooses Zero as his heir to his estate when he is gone. Zero is the closest thing that Gustave has to family and the hotel is the closest thing either of them has to a home. He admits to Zero (on Madame D’s death), “I blame myself. She tried to warn me…but I didn’t listen…There’s really no point to doing anything in life because it’s all gone in the blink of an eye.” This is a truly dreary perspective from Gustave that he counters with telling Zero how good she was in bed. They are then interrupted by the militiamen who enter the train and who Gustave tries to charm and joke with as he would with anyone else, to no avail. After they are assaulted when Zero’s papers are not in order, it is Gustave’s charm after all that saved them. Heckels telling Zero, “Your companion was very kind to me when I was just a lonely little boy,” showing Zero how, while his charms do not always work, Gustave can make a difference in people’s lives by treating them with care and respect. It is through their performance of careful care as hotel employees that they are both detached and closer than anyone else, and, by sharing this secret, Zero allows Gustave to be the closest thing to “real” that is possible.
When Gustave is arrested and in prison, he continues his role as concierge. Anderson highlights this role with the comedic lines of Gustave as he rolls his food cart past each of the cells, offering slop like it is fine cuisine; even salting it for a prisoner. He’s surrounded by hardened criminals and fighting, yet all he wants to do is make life as good for these people as he possibly can. He has Mendl’s smuggled in and shares it with his fellow prisoners, the group including Pinky who he got in an altercation with early on, the altercation itself showing that Gustave can break his act of charm when it suits him and that his desire for control is stronger than his facade. The group has even discussed that he’s “a real straight fellow,” and, “one of us now.” Gustave is delighted and surprised, as he is probably not thanked in the same way for his services in the hotel, as well as the fact that he is just treating the prisoners the way he would anyone else, likely seeing them in a very similar light, saying that even, “The most dreadful and unattractive person only needs to be loved and they will open up like a flower.” Living for the hotel and acting as a concierge are Gustave’s sole purposes in life and are why he does not let go of his duties even while behind bars, giving letters to Zero to read on his behalf to take care of the hotel the way that he would, even giving poems to recite just as he would to remind them that he and the hotel are one in the same. Gustave’s idea to have the digging tools smuggled in with the pastries, that the guard cannot bear to destroy, acts as a metaphor for the charms and kindness of Gustave being the only way to combat the brutishness and bad in the world.
When Gustave escapes through the sewer with the prisoners and meets with Zero, he is quite the opposite of his charming self and is in the shoes of the concierge as a boss and not as a companion. Zero has no disguises for them, no safe house and has not brought a bottle of l’air de panache for Gustave to freshen up with. While not essential to their plan, these things were all included in how Gustave would have done them himself had he been in control. This lack of authority in the moment and his distance from the hotel trigger him to go off on Zero. He condemns him for coming to Zubrowska as an immigrant, saying that if he does not know how to act that they’d be better off if he went back to where he came from. When Zero rebuts with the story of how his father and family were killed and how the violence of the war caused him to leave, Gustave realizes the error of his ways and apologizes, “On behalf of the hotel… Don’t make excuses for me. I owe you my life. You are my dear friend and protégé and I am very proud of you.” What seems to be a very low point of Gustave’s character has a sudden redemption arc when he realizes that these material things don’t matter at all if he hadn’t had Zero to help him. This is the turning point for Gustave seeing Zero as a friend or brother and the only relationship that truly matters to him. This moment is essential to the later scene where Gustave officiates Zero and Agatha’s wedding as well as Gustave’s final moments in the train car where all three have become a family and would fight for each other.
In all, The Grand Budapest Hotel acts as a tale of light within the darkness. It shows how stories of individuals and their relationships can make dire times appear much brighter. Anderson uses the bonds of Zero and Gustave, and later the addition of Agatha, to present a realistic portrayal of how life goes on when tragedy occurs and that all you can do is laugh and try to make the best of your situation. Anderson carefully weaves in the exaggeration of comedic situations and actions with the grim reality of Gustave being framed, people being murdered, and the government falling to a new regime in just a way that makes you think about what you’re watching and makes you question why you feel the way you do. Anderson’s narrative works because, before the viewer even realizes it, they are shown loyalty, love, war, and loss and are told to face it just as the characters are, head-on.

It was her fifth new date in as many weeks, and none of them had been a success. The men all appeared very attractive and almost perfect matches on the screen of her mobile phone. In real life, however, there was always something a bit off. Sometimes more than a bit.
Tonight, it was Jeff. Jeff had potential. Definitely handsome. Probably hadn’t lied about his age. Casual – both his outfit and his demeanour. It turned out his “college education” was a few months of online courses at a community college that had since closed down. He studied international hospitality but gave up when the family business needed his help. He now runs an industrial carpet cleaning firm. Pet odour removal is their specialty.
She’d been wondering if Jeff had noticed that her blazer was not freshly pressed. She’d convinced herself it wasn’t visible. Just to be on the safe side, though, she removed it after the appetiser. This manoeuvre put her full breasts on clear display, barely concealed by the cream-coloured dress she had chosen for the occasion.
Twenty-nine years old, chief researcher at a major pharmaceutical company, she was wondering what had gone wrong. Why did she have to drag herself to dates with strangers instead of curling up on the sofa in her cosy living room – book in one hand and a cabernet sauvignon in the other? Perhaps her father had been right. “You might as well move into a monastery. Just as likely you’ll meet someone there as locked up in your place.”
Jeff ventured into talking about politics just as the main course arrived. He sounded like he had rehearsed what he was saying, but his views were moderate, and for the most part, she found his points reasonable. Then his phone rang. He fished it out of his pocket, looked at the screen, and excused himself. She kept staring in front of her while he was gone, without touching the salmon on her plate.
When he returned, he sat, ran his fingers through his hair, and fidgeted with his shiny, oversized wristwatch.
Then he said, “Have I told you your nails are done beautifully?”

It was my husband’s 45th birthday in November 1989, and we went out to lunch.
I never went out to lunch. András and I never went out to lunch. There simply was no time in his life or in mine for such luxuries, but we did have reasons to celebrate — and plans to make.
The Berlin Wall had been crumbling for months before it came down that November. András had been watching the news with uncommon interest, both professionally, as a political scientist, and personally, as a boy who became a refugee when he and his family fled Soviet tanks during the 1956 Uprising.
His life was now full of teaching at Concordia University and consulting work; mine was filled with teaching at John Abbott College, publishing Matrix magazine, and editing fiction mss. for Véhicule Press. Both our lives were brimming over with our marriage, our three sons, our big house, a yellow Labrador named Hector, and our writing and research; I’d just finished writing my book on Hugh MacLennan’s Two Solitudes.
András was going to be on sabbatical from May 1990, and I’d had good news about a research grant that would release me from teaching for the next three years. We were going to leave this busy life behind, pack up our children and Hector, a few books and other belongings, and spend the year in Budapest.
That was the plan. And that was the start of the Budapest of my imagination.
It did work out, in most ways, but there were unpleasant surprises, along the way. The nastiest was learning that the man who rented our house was a crook. The loveliest was the fairytale hillside villa we moved into in Budapest in June, 1990. The fact that we ended up living there for two years rather than one was hardly any surprise at all.
The most miraculous surprise, for me, was that I was able to write a novel in Hungary.
We returned to Montreal in the summer of 1992, and Birds of Passage was published by Signature Editions in 1993. It’s been out of print for years and now, in a process of rediscovery, I’ve begun to serialize it here and here.
My own rediscovery of that early book, certainly, as I hadn’t reread it for decades.
A rediscovery of the Budapest of that pivotal time, when the first post-communist government elected in Hungary in June 1990 stumbled into something close to anarchy.
And a rediscovery of the hope that fledgling government represented — a hope already being dashed in our first months in Hungary, and a hope that looks poignantly, tragically over-optimistic when viewed in the dark light of today’s Hungary and today’s world.
I’ve never been an expert on Hungary.
I was a foreigner there with a limited understanding of the language. I had been there several times before, though, starting in 1972, and had always been one of only a few foreigners there. I was in the privileged position of having close contact with András, who is an expert, and with many other Hungarians through his extended family and close friends who had been dissidents under the old regime.
And I had daily contact, in my halting Hungarian and my almost-forgotten German, seldom in French and English, with neighbours, my sons’ friends, shopkeepers, my language teachers, and a widening circle of Hungarian writers and artists.
At that November lunch in Montreal, I dreamed I might have time to write while we were in Budapest. And I did start writing almost immediately after we settled in, keeping a journal, taking notes, working on what I thought might be an essay.
Only then, sometime in October 1990, history caught my imagination, and I found myself writing dialogue, structuring a story, and creating characters. I kept going all the next year, telling no one what I was doing, hardly daring to hope this would become a novel.
I was doing my research work, too, and I was editing manuscripts and working remotely with Matrix co-editor Kenneth Radu, designer Susan Valyi, and business manager Diane Hibbard on upcoming issues of the magazine — and, as the months went on, putting together a special issue of stories, poems and images by the writers, translators and artists I was meeting in Hungary. The title of that issue is “The Budapest of the Imagination.”
The rediscovery of Birds of Passage is the rediscovery, for me, of a city I loved and once knew quite well, for a foreigner.
It’s the rediscovery, too, of the person I was then — I was 40 years old in 1990 – and the warily hopeful and bedazzled eyes through which I saw that city at a time when it was impossible to guess what the future had in store for its world-weary denizens, its avian populations, myself, or my family.
Like this new Hungary, my literary career was just a fledgling in 1990. Blue Metropolis was nowhere on the horizon. I had no way of knowing I would one day be a publisher of other writers’ books. And the reason I never told anyone I was writing a novel is that I was afraid it would never get published.
I present it now for readers interested in a great city living through a period of turmoil; for anyone curious about the process of becoming a writer; for those few who will notice how literary mores have evolved in the intervening decades; for everyone mesmerized, as I am, by the power of the imagination; and for amateur ornithologists everywhere.

One of the beauties of this platform is that it allows me to publish chapters of a novel that’s long been out of print and, in the process reread it and reconsider it.
There are practical considerations. I have neither a Word version of the novel now, nor even a pdf, so I’ve been scanning the printed book, chapter by chapter. I then copy and paste each chapter into a Word document. This results in countless glitches I then edit —for “to” has repeatedly become “ot,” to take just that example, and entire paragraphs moved to another page. So, I’m looking for glitches as I reread, trying to catch them all, and making a (very) few other changes necessitated by the passage of time.
I haven’t read the novel as a whole since it was published in 1993, but I’ve now posted 7 of the novel’s 18 chapters online. And it’s a discovery — and not only because I’d forgotten so much of what I wrote in Hungary.
The woman I was 30 years ago is in many ways a stranger to me, for a start. And, as chapter follows chapter, I’m learning things I never knew about writing, about becoming a writer, about putting myself in other people’s shoes, pink or otherwise, and about the connections between writing and pivotal moments in a history, a story, a life.
I’ve been taking notes, this spring, for a new book, when I have half an hour to do so. I’m usually too busy, as I was in 1990, to sit down and just write.
In those days I was in the throes — of wrapping up a semester of teaching, research, editing a new issue of Matrix magazine, preparing another fiction manuscript for publication by Véhicule Press, walking Hector, preparing meals, taking my sons to music class, swimming, pottery.
And today, I’m on a family holiday in a world at war, playing with my grandson Remy, running a publishing business online, planning a boat ride on the Thames, pondering the meaning of family — and writing at 5 a.m. instead of sleeping.
Writing, in my experience, has always been what gets done when I should be doing something else. So, one surprise about Birds of Passage is that it ever got written.
I had forgotten much about Gábor, and almost everything about Eszter, Tivadar, Rudi, even Alice. I do remember focussing a lot of attention on Alice, in particular, for I didn’t want anyone to mistake her for me. In those days the inclusion of autobiographical traits was a favourite cavil in reviews of first novels written by women.
So I’d forgotten how unlike me Alice is, and how comical she can be. I’m both amused and bemused by her curious dress sense, her hair, her nose, her obsessive running, her jumpiness, her outspokenness — and her early career as a photographer with the Royal Ulster Constabulary, of all places.
1990 was a time of change. Every time is a time of change, personally and politically, it’s always both. Like right now, for example.
If I knew that Birds of Passage was a novel about change, though, I had forgotten the extent to which Northern Ireland — and Quebec — figure in the novel, which I remembered as being focused single-mindedly on Budapest.
That city has remained vivid in my memory, but the vividness is unspecific, so I’ve felt jolts of recognition when details in the novel remind me of so much I had forgotten — including the nesting Russian dolls with images of successive Soviet leaders that were on sale in those days on the streets of Budapest.
If I knew that Birds of Passage was a novel about change — everything I write being about change — I had forgotten the extent to which it’s also a novel about home. And about being homeless.
About nationalism, different nationalisms — the nationalisms of Hungary, of Ireland, of Canada and Quebec — that are not so very different from one another, at least to an outsider. And not that different from the nationalisms that are tearing the world apart right now.
The novel is about family, too, a subject that now interests me greatly, surrounded by three generations of my own family, travelling with them, attending a family wedding.It’s about love, about those who are close to you.About foreigners, too, and the foreigners who are close to you.About movement and migration, refugees, exiles, displaced persons, and expatriates, which include those closest to you.About what matters, and how what matters coalesces at key moments in a history, or a life.
I already knew, 30 years ago, that those moments were key, even if I had no way of knowing what would follow, what new vistas they might open up.
I now know what the next three decades had in store for me personally, and I know a lot more about how the future would unfold for Hungary and Ireland, too, not to mention Quebec.
And I now know my first novel did in fact get published; that’s what I hoped for, of course, when I lived in Budapest, hoping against hope. And that, too, has become part of my story. Which means my first novel does end up being in some way autobiographical, in spite of all.
I know much less Hungarian today than I did back then, and I know much less today about the marvellous, complicated city I loved and then left in 1992; that loss is part of the story, too.
And part of my own story. As is revisiting the novel on this platform today.
So, in some ways I don’t understand, Birds of Passage looks forward to a future it could not know, almost as though poised upon a peak in Darien.

Where to go when visiting Budapest?
Sure, you may want to get a little lazy and relax in Szecheny Thermal Baths, or climb the Gellért Hill to have a glance over the nightly Budapest, having a beer (or the famous Hungarian white dessert Tokaji aszú wine) sitting just by the feet of the Liberty Statue, there is a booming music scene n Budapest. And guess what, definitely worth checking out!
Aurora — Toldi — Golya — Ambient — Beat on the Brat — Keret — Durer Kert — Tinta Art Cafe — Larm — Kék ló —
Yes, there are many. And this is not a closed list.
But, for one who loves going for the specific music, here is the list.
If you are into electronic music, Aurora, Ambient and Larm would be the best bets. With Larm going for a dance and more or less techno-club style, Ambient is a more laid-back bar with an audience slightly more inclined to enjoy the drinks, instead of dancing. Aurora is the most un-clubbish of all three, with community centre being at its core, fighting for social rights. Still, you can enjoy some pretty awesome music there on Friday and Saturday nights.
Toldi is another good choice to go for. In daytime a cafe and a (good) movie theatre, it turns into a nightclub when the sun goes down. Located just by the Basilica, it is a good choice for those willing to take a stroll around the city before going clubbing.
Aurora and Golya will take a lead on this, with Durer Kert and Kek Lo following. Both being places hosting a wide set of events, these event avenues are mostly bar-like, welcoming people enjoying all sorts of music styles.
If a true vintage sound is what you are going for, Beat on the Brat is the fool-proof shot. At times feeling ridiculously small, it is a spot for the vintage-obsessed folk to get together at. You can hear everything, from swing to 80s rock, and meet one-of-a-kind people here. Located in the very centre, it is a great place to check out on your way to Larm or other mainstream clubs.
Summer is about to open the doors and bringing down roofs to allow music out. Durer Kert, A38 and Valyo Kikoto are all about open air music. On top of this, make sure not to miss the month of Budapest`s green bridge being locked for locals to enjoy weekend nights on! This is another post though. Stay tuned and meanwhile check the best deals from CuddlyNest!

We started our European River Cruise on a Viking Longship in Budapest! What a great place to begin our trip than surrounded by magnificent buildings and iconic bridges.
Our boat was docked by the Liberty Bridge. This bridge was started in 1894 and finished in 1896 in time for the Millennium World Exhibition. It is the shortest of Budapest’s three bridges (source).
It was built in the art nouveau style and originally named the Francis Joseph Bridge after the emperor who ruled Hungary at the time (source).
We got a good look at the Liberty Bridge on our second day in Budapest when we finished wandering the city’s Market Hall. From the market, we walked straight towards the river and found the Pest entrance of the bridge before us.
“Both portals are decorated with the coat of arms of Hungary designed by Virgil Nagy and two Turul statues each. Turuls are falcon-like birds, prominent in ancient Hungarian mythology.” —…

Much has changed in the literary firmament in the decades since I wrote Birds of Passage in 1990, and one of the most significant changes is our awareness as readers today of issues of cultural appropriation and the appropriation of voice.
Do I have the right to put myself in Gábor’s position? In that of other Hungarian characters, like Tivadar, István, Rudi, Kalliope and Magda?
Or in those Daniel, Pierrette, even Peter?
Is it only Indigenous stories that are out of bounds to me, as a writer with no Indigenous ancestry?
Are the stories of Black people are out of bounds to me, too? That of Alice’s husband Daniel, who is from Goa? How about that of Peter, Alice and Daniel’s mixed-race son?
And what other stories should I not be telling, as a white Canadian woman born in Belfast?
Those of male characters? Or not?
Those of Hungarians, given that I am not Hungarian?
What are the rules, exactly?And do they apply to any story that isn’t my very own?
No one seems too sure about all this, though it’s sometimes argued that these issues arise only (or mostly?) if, say, a white writer profits from their use of the stories of marginalized people.
The American poet Paisley Rekdal has explored this subject in her book Appropriate (Norton, 2021) and her Lithub piece, “Struggling in Workshop with the Question of Cultural Appropriation” (16 Feb 2021).
“Cultural appropriation,” Rekdal writes, “is less a question of ‘staying in one’s lane,’ …than an evolving conversation we must have around privilege and aesthetic fashion in literary practice.”
The English novelist Margaret Drabble argued in 2004 that “appropriation is what novelists do. Whatever we write is, knowingly or unknowingly, a borrowing. Nothing comes from nowhere.”
Having created Guyanese and Jewish characters for her novel The Witch of Exmore and an 18th- century Korean royal protagonist for The Red Queen, Drabble later revised her view in a Publishers Weekly interview, saying, “You can’t just barge in there and assume you have got the right to tell other people’s stories. You have to react sensitively to other people.”
Can that be it?
Is it a question of sensitivity? A question of quality? Is avoiding stereotypes key?
Avoiding stereotypes is always key, surely, but the question remains:
Did I have the right to write Birds of Passage?
It’s true that issues of appropriation were not in the forefront of public attention when I was writing the novel in the early 1990s, also that race is not particularly significant in its pages.
Next question:
Do I have the right to republish Birds of Passage today?
Yes?
No?
What is my “lane”?Am I allowed to write only about myself — out of my own personal experiences?
(As some of you are aware, I have done this several times, and it’s a practice that has sometimes landed me in hot water.)(And I seem to be writing about my own personal experience again, right now. Or, am I mistaken about that?)
Let me do my best to move on, through this thicket, for I do have another question:
What role, if any, is played in this by profit?

The Grand Budapest Hotel boasts a stellar cast, including Ralph Fiennes, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Willem Dafoe, Tilda Swinton, Adrien Brody, Jude Law, and Jeff Goldblum, among many others. However, the true star of the film is the hotel itself. Set in the fictional Eastern European state of Zubrowka (inspired by the spa city of Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic, and named after a Polish bison grass vodka), the film tells a short history of Eastern Europe in the 20th century through the lens of this once-grand establishment.
We witness the hotel in its gilded 1930s heyday, bask in its opulent glow, and then watch as the ravages of time and the Soviet era gradually erode its grandeur. Finally, we find it transformed into a faded relic, the inspiration for a cherished book in the present day. This ambitious narrative demanded a remarkable feat of production design. To capture the passage of time within the same in-film space, the filmmakers ingeniously constructed multiple sets, each intricately layered within the others, like a cinematic Russian nesting doll.
Production designer Adam Stockhausen, a frequent collaborator of director Wes Anderson who also worked on The Darjeeling Limited (2007), Moonrise Kingdom (2012), Isle of Dogs (2018), and The French Dispatch (2021), describes the filmmaking process of The Grand Budapest Hotel as akin to solving a complex puzzle. He candidly admits that The Grand Budapest Hotel presented one of the most formidable challenges of his illustrious career, a sentiment echoed by his experience crafting the intricate stage design for Charlie Kaufman’s film-within-a-film Synecdoche, New York (2008).
BackgroundBefore traveling to Europe for location scouting, Wes Anderson and Adam Stockhausen conducted extensive research, studying archival photographs of numerous hotels across various locations, including London, Scotland, and Switzerland. This research provided a foundation for their exploration, allowing them to identify potential sites that aligned with their vision for the film.
During their European travels, Anderson and Stockhausen drew significant inspiration from the historical narratives embedded within the real-world locations they encountered. A poignant example was a local civic centre, once a testament to architectural grandeur, now left to decay. Stockhausen vividly recalls the hammer marks that marred the intricate carvings, a stark reminder of the passage of time and the erosion of beauty.
The town of Karlovy Vary in Czech Republic, with its picturesque pastel-coloured buildings lining the riverfront and its collection of elegant hotels perched on overlooking hills, perfectly captured the desired aesthetic and mood for the film. Its unique atmosphere ultimately inspired the choice of this location as the primary outdoor shooting site.
Bristol Palace HotelWhile Grandhotel Pupp is often cited as the primary aesthetic inspiration for Wes Anderson’s fictional Grand Budapest Hotel, the Bristol Palace Hotel in Karlovy Vary bears a more striking resemblance to the film’s iconic structure. Its distinctive pink facade, adorned with mansard roof, dormer windows, flanking turrets, and a stag atop its peak, was remarkably replicated in the film, creating a visually striking homage that almost appears like a hyper-realistic, larger-than-life version of the Bristol Palace.
The Bristol Palace Hotel is an integral part of the Bristol Group complex, a collection of seven buildings developed by two prominent Karlovy Vary families: the esteemed physician Dr. Willem Fasolt and the renowned hotelier family, the Tellers. Between 1872 and 1908, they constructed several properties in the tranquil “Westend” district of the city, including the Bristol Villa (now the Bristol Palace Hotel), Königsvila (Královská Villa), Teresa (Tereza), and Fasolt (now Livia), all intended to provide a haven for hospitality and relaxation.
Designed by Viennese architects Hans Schidl and Alfred Bayer in the spirit of Viennese historicism, the Bristol Palace Hotel showcases a captivating blend of architectural styles inspired by castle architecture. Recognised as one of the most valuable and visually appealing buildings in the Czech Republic, the iconic Bristol Palace Hotel should not be confused with the larger Hotel Bristol, the main building within the Bristol Group complex. The latter was constructed on the site of a former Jewish synagogue, tragically destroyed during the Nazi-orchestrated Kristallnacht in 1938.
Grandhotel PuppWhile Adam Stockhausen often cited Grandhotel Pupp as a major inspiration for The Grand Budapest Hotel, many believe the film draws more inspiration from the hotel’s dramatic location — perched on a hill, surrounded by forest, and overlooking the town of Karlovy Vary — and its overall sense of grandeur.
The 228-room Grandhotel Pupp significantly surpasses the Bristol Palace Hotel in size and age. Its history dates back to 1907 with the construction of the Saxony Hall by Anton Deiml, then Mayor of Karlovy Vary. Subsequently, Mayor Becher built the Bohemian Hall on adjacent land, creating direct competition. The Pupp family acquired the Saxony Hall in 1776 and later the Bohemian Hall in 1890. Between 1896 and 1907, renowned Viennese architects Fellner & Helmer transformed these family-owned buildings into the neo-Baroque Grandhotel Pupp that stands today. This rich and intricate history is meticulously detailed on the hotel’s official website.
Grandhotel Pupp boasts a distinguished guest list, having welcomed a diverse array of luminaries throughout its history. From the intellectual giants like Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud and Czech writer Franz Kafka to renowned composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Richard Wagner, and even historical figures like Russian astronaut Yuri Gagarin and statesmen Napoleon Bonaparte and Otto von Bismarck, the hotel has played host to a veritable who’s who of history.
Grandhotel Pupp made a cinematic appearance in the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale, where it served as the fictional Hotel Splendide, set in Montenegro.
Görlitz WarenhausWes Anderson sought a realistic location for filming the Grand Budapest Hotel’s interiors and discovered the vacant Görlitz department store, an abandoned building that allowed complete artistic control and time flexibility. This twentieth-century Görlitz Warenhaus, with its impressive atrium, became the centrepiece of the production. The atrium itself was transformed into the hotel lobby, while the open galleries of the surrounding floors were adapted into hotel corridors, complete with meticulously placed hotel rooms.
To furnish these spaces, the production team meticulously sourced furniture and decor from various eras, ensuring authenticity within the film’s timeline. The top two floors of the department store were repurposed to house production offices and storage for cameras and wardrobe. During the ten-week shoot in early 2013, the entire film crew, including actors Tilda Swinton, Willem Dafoe, and Ralph Fiennes, resided at the neighbouring Hotel Börse.
The site of the Görlitz Warenhaus has a rich history. In 1717, it housed the “Goldener Strauß” (Golden Ostrich) inn, which later expanded into a hotel. Inspired by the renowned Wertheim department store on Leipziger Platz in Berlin, the Görlitz city council envisioned a similar establishment at this location. Potsdam architect Carl Schmanns designed the “department store at the ostrich,” and construction commenced in 1912 after the demolition of the existing hotel. Built with a steel skeleton and adorned with an Art Nouveau facade, the department store opened to the public on 30 September 1913.
The Görlitz Warenhaus experienced multiple changes in ownership, and at one point, Anderson even considered purchasing the building to prevent its demolition. In June 2013, investor Winfried Stöcker acquired the property with plans to revive it as a department store. However, the reopening faced numerous delays, initially planned for 2016 and then for the fall of 2017, due to the realisation that extensive restoration and renovation were necessary.
In November 2020, the project encountered a significant setback when a dispute arose concerning the demolition of two neighboring buildings. Stöcker sought to demolish these structures to improve delivery access to the store and a nearby parking garage. However, the local landmark preservation office mandated their preservation. This impasse led to Stöcker threatening to abandon the entire project if demolition was not permitted.
The smallest detailsOccasionally, the scope of a film’s vision surpasses the limitations of physical sets. In such instances, the filmmakers must employ creative solutions. For The Grand Budapest Hotel, this involved a skillful blend of practical and digital techniques, utilizing matte paintings and miniature effects to convincingly create the illusion of grandeur and scale. Wes Anderson, while primarily favouring practical filmmaking, recognises the value of post-production techniques like visual effects, colour timing, and other digital enhancements, when necessary.
This approach is evident from the very beginning of the film. The introduction scene to the hotel involves a sweeping horizontal movement across the landscape. It culminates in a dramatic reveal of the hotel perched majestically atop a hill, with a funicular ascending towards it. This specific image was intentionally created using miniatures, as no such location exists in reality. This technique harkens back to the classic Hollywood tradition of utilising models to achieve desired cinematic effects.
Under the guidance of Simon Weisse, a team of skilled prop makers at Studio Babelsberg in Berlin meticulously constructed scale models of the structures, working in tandem with the production team at the Görlitz Warenhaus. The Grand Budapest Hotel set, featuring the hotel building atop a wooded ledge complete with a funicular, was meticulously crafted. This was further enhanced by a Friedrichian landscape painting seamlessly integrated with green-screen technology. The 3-meter-high hotel model was meticulously sculpted using silicone resin molds and adorned with intricate brass embellishments. To create the illusion of light, photographs of the Görlitz Warenhaus set were strategically placed within the model’s windows.
To achieve the aged, brutalist aesthetic of the Soviet-era Grand Budapest Hotel, the visual effects team employed a combination of computer-generated models, intricate lighting, matte effects, and carefully orchestrated shadows. A similar technique was utilised to create the observatory, where the base miniature was constructed in separate pieces. The observatory was rendered with 20 distinct elements, with the final digital rendering refined further at Anderson’s request, requiring approximately one hour per shot.
Costume designer Milena Canonero meticulously captured the essence of each character through their wardrobe. While the hotel uniforms adhered to the stylistic conventions of the 1930s, the color palette was intentionally unconventional. The majority of the costumes were crafted within the Görlitz Warenhaus workshop, with additional pieces sourced from Berlin-based Theaterkunst and the uniforms produced by a Polish workshop. The filmmakers drew inspiration from renowned artists such as photographers Man Ray and George Hurrell, and painters Gustav Klimt, Kees van Dongen, Tamara de Lempicka, and George Grosz.
Just as Wes Anderson enlisted Marc Jacobs, then creative director of Louis Vuitton, to design period-inspired suitcases for The Darjeeling Limited, he commissioned Miuccia Prada to create a 21-piece set of luggage for Madame D. (Tilda Swinton) and Concierge Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) in The Grand Budapest Hotel. Drawing inspiration from the 1920s and 1930s, when Prada primarily focused on leather goods, the luggage showcases exquisite turn-of-the-century finishes and the iconic Grana Paglia pattern. While not a central plot point, these meticulously crafted pieces leave a lasting impression on the viewer.
Graphic designWes Anderson enlisted graphic designer Annie Atkins to bring the fictional world of The Grand Budapest Hotel to life. Previously an art director at McCann Erickson in Reykjavik, Iceland, Atkins was relatively new to film design. She meticulously designed nearly every on-screen artefact bearing text — ubrowka money, police reports, passports, telegrams, pastry packaging, perfume lettering, and even a prison map.
To achieve this, Atkins drew inspiration from reference materials meticulously collected by herself, Anderson, and production designer Adam Stockhausen during extensive location scouting. Her dedication was evident in her meticulous process, often sketching 20 variations of a single artefact by hand daily. This painstaking effort paid off, allowing her to keep cherished mementos like the iconic The Grand Budapest Hotel book, a Mendl’s box, and a bloodstained telegram from Serge the butler.
Atkins’s attention to detail extended beyond the screen. She adapted the hotel’s entrance sign from a 1930s metal sign Anderson discovered in Cairo, creating a hand-drawn version with somewhat uneven, jaunty serifs. Even objects unseen on screen, like Ralph Fiennes’ character Gustave H’s notebook, received meticulous consideration. Fiennes preferred lined pages, though, reflecting the character’s personality, a detail that Wes loves.
The fictional newspapers in The Grand Budapest Hotel — The Trans Alpine Yodel, The Daily Fact, and The Continental Drift — showcase Anderson’s meticulousness. He wrote every story, regardless of on-screen appearance or relevance to the main plot, and Atkins designed each newspaper accordingly. Authenticity was paramount. Atkins even studied Hitler’s calling card to design a business card for a fascist character in the film.
For those seeking to replicate the “aged” look of props, Atkins offers a practical tip: use three Barry’s tea bags to age paper by ten years. Even if props are new within the film’s narrative, the audience expects an “old” aesthetic for a period piece.
DigitalTo further immerse audiences in the world of The Grand Budapest Hotel, a fictional website called the Akademie Zubrowka was created. This online platform, reminiscent of the 1960s, offered a series of stylised lessons on the history of the fictional Republic of Zubrowka.
Designed to seamlessly blend the aesthetics of the late 1960s with the 1930s setting of the film, the Akademie Zubrowka website mimicked a microfiche machine, complete with a navigational wheel to guide viewers through the digital “slides.” Photographs were meticulously recreated to resemble hand-coloured black-and-white prints, further enhancing the nostalgic ambiance.
Watson Digital, working closely with Fox Searchlight and director Wes Anderson himself, produced the entire site in-house. This collaborative effort allowed Anderson to fully explore and develop the stylised fictional world he envisioned, including an unusual amount of written content. While this presented a design challenge, the team embraced the opportunity to work directly with the director to bring his vision to life.
The Akademie Zubrowka was met with enthusiastic reception from fans of Anderson’s work. It provided a unique opportunity to delve deeper into the film’s world and was featured in publications such as Variety and MovieWeb.
Unfortunately, the Akademie of Zubrowka website was discontinued around 2018. However, interested viewers can still explore it through the Wayback Machine. Alternatively, if you ever had the pleasure of staying at the fictional Grand Budapest Hotel, you might consider sharing your experiences by writing a review on its (fictional) TripAdvisor page here.
The Grand Budapest Hotel was basically a critical darling, showing up on tons of critics’ “best of” lists. Everyone raved about how incredibly well-crafted it was, especially its zany vibe and that signature Wes Anderson touch. On Rotten Tomatoes, a whopping 92% of 319 critics gave it the thumbs up, while Metacritic gave it a fancy score of 88 out of 100 based on 48 reviews. The film’s Akademie Zubrowka also won numerous awards including one Webby in 2015.
At the 87th Academy Awards, the film received nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Film Editing. It ultimately won awards for Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and Best Original Score, which you can hear below.

Illusions of Grandeur in THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL
“To be frank, I think his world has vanished long before he ever entered it. But I will say, he certainly sustained the illusion with a marvelous grace.” — Zero Mustafa, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL
The key to survival in Wes Anderson’s 2014 film “The Grand Budapest Hotel” is keeping up appearances. Though the film is presented in Anderson’s trademark pristine dollhouse-like style, the world within it can be as nasty and ruthless as our own. One look at a poster for the film with its pastel colored buildings and calligraphic lettering gives no indication that the film will that feature brutal prison shankings, a beheading, and an extended shootout occuring on several floors of the eponymous hotel.
But that’s the artistry at work in Wes Anderson’s masterpiece: what appears to be merely a light, madcap romp turns out also to be a rather melancholy tale of two social climbers learning that there are dangers in the ritzy world of the upper class no different from the ones they’ve escaped.
Our two leads Zero and Monsieur Gustave are outsiders dealing in matters far above their pay grade, and only survive by taking heed to the old adage “act like you’ve been here before”.
Zero, whom we meet as the unassuming Lobby Boy and loyal sidekick of Monsieur Gustave turns out to be a refugee of Anderson’s version of WWII and the eventual owner of the hotel. Behind his big, watchful eyes hides a painful past filled with memories of the family he lost in the war.
While Gustave’s past is never quite so defined, we know from his own words he also came from humble beginnings, even once having served as Lobby Boy himself. What’s most fascinating about Gustave is that the persona he displays throughout the movie is a whole cloth fabrication. He’s no more a member of high-society than Zero, though he’d never let you know and you’d never be able to tell. He’s absorbed his regal, professional disposition from the aristocrats and old-money figures who frequent the hotel.
When the pair escape the home of the DeGoff und Taxis family with “Boy with Apple” in tow, they do so by doing their best to blend in and not draw attention to themselves (despite their loud purple uniforms). It isn’t until Gustave announces his presence that anyone even notices the two were there to begin with. And this isn’t the only time they find a way to look the part. Much of the last act is filled with the two changing in and out of various disguises in order to keep themselves out of early graves.
On two occasions we see Zero and Gustave aboard a train whose path is blocked by soldiers. searching for refugees. On these occasions, Zero escapes the firing squads his family fell victim to on the strength of Gustave’s good name, — “he’s with me” Gustave assures the soldiers — while Gustave survives (at least once) due to his aristocratic manner and past kind deeds, but a kind, aristocrat is not exactly who he is. Outside of his duties as concierge, Gustave can be rather profane, bitter, vain, rude, insensitive, and even crass, but he knows when to turn on the charm. That charm gets him brief access to the finest things Anderson’s world has to offer. Until it doesn’t.
Ultimately, Gustave meets that early grave he’d been eluding. The costume he wears can’t get him through every door or out of every jam. Being a rich, vain, blonde doesn’t save his life in the end, and truth be told, it never did. The character of “Monsieur Gustave H. of the Grand Budapest Hotel” gave him entree into this fanciful world, but it doesn’t protect him within it. What saves Gustave is his willingness in his darkest moments to strip away all (most) pretense and meet Zero and others on their level. Not as the concierge of an esteemed hotel, but as a helpless man who had no one else to turn to. For it isn’t any of his rich lovers who break him out of prison. His escape is made with the help of some lowly inmates and his loyal lobby boy. It’s not until he hears Zero’s story and feels his pain that they truly connect and become as Zero puts it “brothers”.
What Gustave internalizes in the end is that what endears one most to others is the way you treat them. No one likes Gustave because he’s posh or learned, they like him because of his meticulous attention to detail, his loyalty, and being as Captain Henckels puts it “very kind”. That kindness and care is what wins over his man lady “friends”, it’s what wins over his cutthroat cellmates, and it’s what fully wins over his eventual heir, Zero.

Note: Most review fragments taken from the author’s Reddit review.
I must be the most pathetic movie aficionados to not get the chance to watch Wes Anderson movies. I’ve heard the words: picturesque, aesthetic, symmetrical. All-in-all satisfying. I’ve heard The Grand Budapest Hotel in years, yet it’s only in 2021 where I get to watch it, 7 years after its release.
Can I just open by saying how I love myself after this? Because finally, finally, anticipation is paid off. Nearly-decade long anticipation. It is rare for a movie to leave me so amused as if I have just littered by mouth with foams of fluffy clouds. It’s like marijuana, but visual, coming from Disney, and legal. At least, in some states — OK, I admit, I have a bad sense of humour.
Nobody shall deny that this is splendid. If you’re looking for a movie to relax and to improve your eyesight, this could be one. A vintage yet faithful depiction of a fascist regime framed by slapstick humour. Often movies can’t blend various elements, but The Grand Budapest Hotel does it right. The cinematography, visuals, and editing are to die for — I can’t stress this enough. The hype is not overhyped, it seems for the first time. There are some issues, though, with the brightness (it often feels too bright), and I don’t understand why a squared aspect ratio is preferred for the modern-day but widescreen is used for the late 60s and 80s.
But also, nobody can deny that there is a flaw in this movie. A huge, huge flaw. It is not delivered well.
The first minutes are nothing short of a masterpiece. Somehow I find the way Madame saying “I’m not leaving” funny, it sounds like a rom-com satire. The inciting incident is expressed naturally, so I have few complaints.
Amid it, the movie starts falling apart, apart from the camerawork, acting, and grandeur overture. Considering the prologue and first two parts takes a long time, I expect the remaining time to be much more, not specifically longer, but more elements. Right now the main plot is easily predictable: there’s gonna be a winter prison break, and a kiddie fight for Boy with Apple.
Right now, the cinematography is misleading. It is like a visual drug to keep you awake on a starting-to-get-boring movie. Kinda the same for the acting. Some of the throwaway plot points still remain enjoyable, but they don’t contribute to improving the plot. Because of the nature of the movie, everything feels trivial and I don’t connect with the characters anymore.
The ending is melancholic and satisfying. But a large part of “satisfying” is, “Finally! This movie is over I kinda… knew it.” I didn’t feel anything, other than the common chills I get every time I see a movie. I didn’t feel moved or questioning things or stuff like that. Except I did question one thing: “Why did they choose that font for the subtitles?”
The Grand Budapest Hotel is not a cursed premise nor an unnatural narrative. It explores controversial and strong themes, with great technical work. But Wes Anderson did not seem to dive deeper into the script, rather only anticipated in shooting it. The movie is a fine work. But it’s not great, and can do better. Nobody can deny, though, that Gustave’s legacy will carry on for long on the big screen.

Sitting in the Dark
Like most survivors of extreme trauma, my father Laszlo never talked about what he had endured during and after WWII. Such avoidance is understandable — why bring back pain so mercifully repressed with the help of time, distractions, and forgetfulness? Why relive reminders of suffering and death, when the guilt of survival is already too much to bear?
Laszlo never spoke much, anyway, facilitating his evasion while exacerbating my curiosity. Weekday nights he’d come home from work at 5pm, demanding dinner on the table. We ate with my mother in awkward silence, or cowering from his wrath. From there he sat in his big chair in front of the TV, reading the paper until 10pm. Off to bed, rinse and repeat.
One random night the power went out, no television and no light to read his newspaper. As we lit candles and sat in the flickering shadows, I asked him again about the war. The few times I tried were failures, Laszlo wondering why I would care, why would anyone care, since he and his family suffered to the indifference of their neighbors, and the world.
He made a good point, but that night I gave it another whirl, and — surprise surprise — he started to speak slowly in his native Hungarian, buried words arduously clawing to the surface. He had a deep, Bela Lugosi voice, and I felt as though The Grinch Who Stole Christmas were narrating The Bombing of Budapest. We journeyed to Hungary in 1944, only thirty years before…
That summer an average of ten thousand people were murdered per day in the camps. Meanwhile, sixteen-year-old Laszlo lived large at a refurbished Jewish Community Center taken over by the Gestapo and SD. He was part of the expendable local help that had been rounded up by the Germans soon after the Tiger tanks clanked through the cobbled Budapest streets.
Jewish talent was recruited by the Germans across various trades: tailors, seamstresses, carpenters, electricians. Laszlo was chosen by his high school principal as designated draftsman, price paid for being the most talented in shop class. The Nazis gave him his own secretary and office — he decorated it with mounted animal heads ripped from a taxidermist’s shop.
Laszlo was a tall, dashing, Errol Flynn-looking kid with a deeply cynical sense of humor, and the Übermensch thought he was cool. Laszlo thought the tall, dashing, blond-haired blue-eyed Aryans were cool, too, creating an odd Ashkenazi-Nazi dynamic. Entertaining them as class clown and mascot, they printed official documents making him an officer in the SD.
Laszlo felt invincible as most teens do, and had no idea what was soon in store, including a brush with Adolf Eichmann, being caught playing cards on the job, nearly beaten to death and thrown into solitary confinement, released with no shoes into the wintry Siege of Budapest, hidden in a neighbor’s cellar, and nearly deported to Siberia by the Russians.
At some point between sharing air with Eichmann and being tortured, Laszlo sat in his office one summer evening, drawing Wehrmacht uniform insignia and various armaments. The air raid siren went off, staffers panicked. Above them the B-24 Liberators from the Fifteenth Expeditionary Air Force were in formation, attacking the city.
The heavy aircraft dropped mines into the Danube River, and bombs onto Hungarian factories, refineries, and oil tanks. They also released leaflets throughout Budapest that boldly threatened the enemy with retribution for deporting thousands of Jews to the gas chambers in Auschwitz. The world was watching, they said — too bad the Allies didn’t actually try to stop it.
Seeing the Light
“We must go downstairs to the shelter!” the secretary shrieked, rushing into his office. Weighing whether to follow her and use the fog of war to try and get some nookie, or see what was going on, he opted for the latter. “A direct hit kills us all, anyway,” he said. “So I’m going up to the roof. Want to join me?” Despite his resemblance to Errol Flynn, she fled into the bunker.
He went up, not down, made himself comfortable on the rooftop, and watched the show. Search lights darted across the sky, as anti-aircraft flak burst around the illuminated bomber formations and escorting fighter squadrons. Laszlo watched streams of incendiaries pour out of the big planes, saw the distant explosions as factories and depots erupted.
An unlucky Liberator took a direct hit, left wing breaking off as the bomber dipped and plummeted. Spiraling downward, several parachutes became visible, bobbing dreamily as they floated serenely over the roiling city. Laszlo wondered what being an allied serviceman flying in those planes and now shot down must be like, descending into a strange city at war.
As a kid, Laszlo loved watching American movies, and like most Europeans romanticized the States based on Hollywood films. His emulation of Errol Flynn was no accident, the actor smoothly embodying the epitome of a swashbuckling lady’s man. Laszlo loved him in The Adventures of Robin Hood. Bored in class, he dreamt of some day becoming a Yankee Doodle.
As a teen, Laszlo watched the real life show of swiveling beams reflect off the flak bursts and vapor trails, as the surviving heavy bombers released their loads and flew back to safety, the anti-aircraft fire dying down and search lights thinning. Still alive, he trundled back downstairs and returned to his office. “You are crazy!” his secretary said, duly impressed.
Everything went back to “normal” until about an hour later, when Laszlo heard commotion and loud, guttural German voices outside his office. He went to his door, opened it, and saw his Nazi buddies standing nearby chatting, pointing, and calling out. One of the parachuting bombardiers had been caught, and was now put on display for his merciless captors.
Three decades later in flickering candle light, Laszlo shared his wonder at making direct eye contact with his first American: A young man only a few years older, red haired and freckled, wearing a US airman’s uniform and boots. Beaten, his face was covered in gashes and welts — too weak to walk, he was dragged down the hallway, his crimson blood trailing behind.
Laszlo knew nothing about the Geneva Conventions, and neither did the Gestapo, who tortured Laszlo’s First American to death a few doors down the hall. As I watched my father speak, I imagined young Laszlo at his desk beneath the mounted animal heads, trying to concentrate as the young US flyer cried out. American dream turned to nightmare, an ominous sign?
Only a few months earlier, Laszlo was hanging out with his friends, complaining about his parents, ignoring his younger brother, trying to get laid, and wondering about his future when the most brutal war in human history literally came knocking at his door. Of the hundred or so students in his high school class, only sixteen survived. He was one of them.
The price usually paid for survival is guilt: “Why was I spared, and not the others?” Another cost is the jealousy, defeatism, and victimization that guilt-ridden survivors hurl at their own families. A few decades after that fateful evening, Laszlo stared into the face of another American — his first and only son. I likely filled him with equal curiosity, wonder, and terror.

Apart from one firecracker set off one day early, a neighbor having a short but noisy party in the late evening, and a couple waking me up with their rather loud orgasms the morning after, there was no real sign of celebration.
I traveled to Budapest on the 27th of December, thinking that New Year’s Eve (NYE) may be like Christmas in Budapest; everything including the busses shuts down around 3 PM, and if you’re unlucky enough not to have booked a taxi then you aren’t likely to go anywhere unless you are walking. And many people do. From morning until late afternoon, you will see people out for ‘walks’, but they are actually on their way to where they are celebrating Christmas Eve. They’ll be dressed in moderately nice clothes and carrying wine bottles or other enjoyable Christmas things. However, NYE is not all like like Christmas Eve in this bohemian city — people just don’t care that much — and this surprised me enough to jump into an air balloon — literally.
You see, when I realized that I had again made a booboo — last year I knew nothing about busses shutting down and ended up needing to get picked up by family members — and that I should have booked myself onto a NYE boat trip or some form of party for tourists, I was rather upset. Not even my cousin…

It wasn’t a long time ago when I asked Stefan about his work, but here comes a new interview, since he has just finished another drawing on Budapest. Let’s find out what has happened to him since last September.
What has happened to you since we spoke last year?All of a sudden, things went really fast after our first interview. Apart from two successful exhibitions in Holland, the media took note of my work last December, which led to newspaper publications in the UK, Belgium, Holland and Italy and a score of Internet publications. Later on, in January, I was invited to appear on the Belgian national television in a talk show named Bart and Siska. Currently, I’m preparing work for a number of future exhibitions in Holland and Switzerland later this year.
If you speak Dutch here is the video for you to watch:http://www.een.be/programmas/bart-siska/tekentalent-stefan-bleekrode
You have just finished another drawing on Budapest. Could you tell us about the process? The initial large-scale drawing was merely based on Budapest; I used the architecture and many landmarks to create a “new” city based on Budapest. I wasn’t entirely satisfied with that work because of the faulty perspective and somewhat monotonous background. Immediately, I felt I needed to do another piece sometime. It took me almost two years to meditate on this new piece that had to include not just most of the famous sights but also offers a view more captivating than the previous drawing.
The perspective plays a major role in all of Stefan’s works. He is well known for drawing from a bird’s eye perspective so I was eager to hear about how the process went this time. Furthermore, Budapest also belongs to that group of cities that offer a lot of possibilities for artists to capture it on their artworks. Last time Stefan was flying from the Liberty Bridge towards the Margaret Island, but now he has begun his trip in District 13.
How did you decide on the perspective of the drawing this time?This perspective was in my mind already for quite a long time but it took me a while to get things sorted out, and not until my previous visit to Budapest, last year in May, I felt confident enough to tackle what was really quite a difficult subject. When I walked around the city I noticed there were many geometric forms, for instance the street layout and the rooftop angles. This perspective is broken by straight and diagonal boulevards, and the river running across the city. Getting the perspective right was essential.
Before I did any ink drawing I made extensive pencil sketches to get the composition right. So I made the Saint Stephen’s Boulevard shorter than in reality and left some of the area South of it out of the drawing. To make the drawing a bit less monotonous, an endless sea of roofs, I made Elisabeth Square and Déak Square bigger, kind of turned it into a park. Still, even as I went along I kept making changes: I made the river wider, and later on I decided to raise the horizon a bit and obscure it with a watercolour wash.
Stefan’s success cannot be only seen in the media but he actually makes a living as an artist, which does not necessarily happen to everyone who dedicates her/his life to art. Stefan is an exception as he has sold several of his artworks and probably will sell many more. Let’s find out where one should look for the new drawing(s)!
What happens to it now?The drawing got sold immediately upon completion to a Dutch family who used to live in Budapest for three years. I suppose it will be framed now before the buyers collect it from the gallery.
Are you planning to draw more pieces on Budapest?Yes, there’s already a small drawing under construction of a busy intersection with trams and buses, similar to Astoria. Maybe one day I’ll do a view of Buda Castle and the old district next to it. Other than that, I was thinking of doing perhaps a city like Pécs, I haven’t been there yet but it is apparently very beautiful.
Unfortunately, we still have to wait for an exhibition taking place in Hungary, but if you happen to be in the Netherlands or Switzerland, take the opportunity and visit one of the galleries showcasing Stefan’s pieces. Stefan is naming the destination in his last answer.
If someone is interested in seeing your works in person where s/he should go?My work is currently on sale and display at the Frank Welkenhuysen Gallery in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Besides this, I’ll have a show with oil colours at Galerie Müller in Luzern this summer and more drawings will go on display at Keine Kunst in Bern this fall. But it would be great to show some of my Hungary-inspired pieces in Budapest or elsewhere!

I will never forget the first time I saw the Danube. It was my first time in Budapest, and, as I walked toward the impressive world-famous Hungarian Parliament Building, I saw the beautiful city lights reflected on the river’s peaceful waters under the pink and purple sunset. I was speechless.
Hungary is most known for its fascinating capital, Budapest, recently considered the second best city to visit in Eastern Europe in U.S. News ranking and included in Time’s World’s Greatest Places in 2023. However, this country has much more to offer to international visitors and tourism has significantly recovered in the past few years.
Data Confirms Travelers Want To Explore Hungary And Love Budapest
More than 6 million international travelers explored the country this summer 2023. According to Statista, most foreign visitors are from neighboring countries: Slovakia, Romania, and Austria.
However, especially in Budapest, you can encounter travelers from all over the world. This is a relief as it’s easier to communicate in English and it is the most common language used in tourist places and among visitors. I tried to learn a few words in Hungarian but couldn’t get past “thank you” — Köszönöm — , and I quickly understood why Hungarian is considered one of the most difficult languages in the world. Luckily, this is not a barrier to visiting, but tour guides do help provide a much more enriching experience.
The Hungarian government said that tourism exceeded their expectations in 2022 and that this year the records will show higher rates compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019. And it’s easy to see why this destination attracts more travelers.
Hungary Is A Perfect Destination For Pleasure And Relaxation
There are over 1,300 thermal water springs — Budapest is home to more than 100 — where tourists can relax and experience the best of Hungarian culture most times of the year. From historical places with outstanding architecture to calming retreats in rural areas.
Travelers usually enjoy eating local food with unique flavors and exotic combinations. I can now say that the goulash is one of my favorite soups, and the Hungarian pizza, the Langallo, must be added to any traveler’s bucket list.
Enriching Experiences Beyond Food And Spas
Hungary has so much to offer. Those who enjoy a fun night can have a special time at the ruin bars or try one of Budapest’s top attractions: take a Danube River cruise.
History lovers will be amazed at all the drama related to Empress Elisabeth of Austria — known as Sissi — and can also admire the sculptures and all the incredible stories behind them.
Even though the predominant religion is Catholic, visitors can see fascinating buildings and chapels from different religions like the Great Synagogue of Budapest — the largest in Europe — or Matthias Church on Castle Hill in Budapest.
Depending on your travel plans, there are also festivals, events, and new attractions. Hungary is one of those destinations that make you want to go back even before you leave.

Budapest, Hungary.
We've had fun over these last few weeks trying to figure out how to ask the most basic of questions, “Do you speak English” which at face value doesn't sound overly difficult. You would be mistaken. Our brains are like sieves and as quick as I pour the “Sprechen Sie Englisch?”, “mluvíš anglicky” and “beszélsz angolul” in, it falls right back out. Personally, I blame the internet.
As you start getting hit with travel fatigue and a loss of direction on big trips like these, there are some cities which pull you right back into the fray and make you realise how beautiful Europe during Christmas can be. Budapest certainly falls into this category and after almost two months, two continents and nine countries deep we needed it.
Our first few days saw us checking out the usual city landmarks of castles, churches and Christmas markets and they certainly didn't disappoint in any way. The awe-inspiring Buda Castle in the aptly named Castle district where we visited an underground labyrinth (used as a war shelter, jail and even linked to Dracula!) was amazing. The stunning St Stephens Basilica and Fishermans Bastion; everywhere you look there is something gorgeous and jaw-dropping.
The highlight of this city was definitely the natural hot spring baths of Széchenyi, opened in 1913 and looking the part. Three huge outdoor pools (25°C–35°C) and a multitude of indoor pools, spas and steaming hot saunas. The snow falling all around and -4°C at arrival made it even more special. I highly recommend Budapest to anyone and everyone.
Christmas day was spent in Krakow, Poland and was indeed a white one. I will say it was a quiet few days for us as George came down with a nasty bout of the flu. I took to the streets myself and kept the step counter going by walking the wet and snowy alleys and side paths. Up to Wawel castle, through the Jewish quarter and around Old town.
While in Krakow we visited the Auschwitz concentration camp for the day. It sits about 60kms out of Krakow, it covers a massive area, contains multiple different camps and is about as sombre as you can imagine. It didn't feel right to take a heap of photos or selfies out of consideration for every one that passed through this place so I've only included a couple of the complex.
Next stop is Warsaw and then the Baltic states for New Year's Eve. Bring it on.
Gary.

Here is my take on this exercise from a previous series of posts — How To Read A Screenplay:
After a first pass, it’s time to crack open the script for a deeper analysis and you can do that by creating a scene-by-scene breakdown. It is precisely what it sounds like: A list of all the scenes in the script accompanied by a brief description of the events that transpire.
For purposes of this exercise, I have a slightly different take on scene. Here I am looking not just for individual scenes per se, but a scene or set of scenes that comprise one event or a continuous piece of action. Admittedly this is subjective and there is no right or wrong, the point is simply to break down the script into a series of parts which you then can use dig into the script’s structure and themes.
The value of this exercise:
* We pare down the story to its most constituent parts: Scenes.
* By doing this, we consciously explore the structure of the narrative.
* A scene-by-scene breakdown creates a foundation for even deeper analysis of the story.
This week: The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). You may download the script here.
Screenplay by Wes Anderson, story by Wes Anderson & Hugo Guinness, inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig
IMDb plot summary: The adventures of Gustave H, a legendary concierge at a famous hotel from the fictional Republic of Zubrowka between the first and second World Wars, and Zero Moustafa, the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend.
The Grand Budapest Hotel
Scene by Scene Breakdown
by Rob Hoskins
GoIntoTheStory.com
1–2: In present day, a girl enters Old Lutz Cemetery. She stops at a bust of ‘Author’, memorialized with hotel-room keys hanging on hooks. She holds a book, ‘The Grand Budapest Hotel’, with the Author’s face on the back cover. Twenty years prior, in his study, the same-aged author, begins the narration of the story.
2–6: The late sixties. The author describes how he came to take up rooms in the once-celebrated GBH, and laments its “present” state and descent into shabbiness. It is sparsely populated by a rather solitary group of vacationers, and overseen by the second-rate concierge M. Jean.
Introducing Mr. Moustafa. A figure projecting true loneliness. M. Jean provides an overview of his rags to riches story and the author is intrigued. The primer on Mr. Moustafa is interrupted as M. Jean sprints to action, to save a fat businessman from choking on his biscotti.
6–8: Fate intervenes, and the author and Mr. Moustafa meet in the hammam. Mr. Moustafa opens a polite conversation by stating his admiration for the author’s work. “How did you come to buy it… the Grand Budapest?”, the curious author inquires. Mr. Moustafa invites him to dine and to hear his story.
8: Mr. Moustafa commences the narration of the main story: ‘It begins of course with…’
Part 1: “M. Gustave”
9–16: M. Gustave, in his element, directing hotel staff in the service of guests. An elegant, well-oiled (and well-perfumed) machine. He sits with Madame C.V.D.u.T. (referred to in the script as “Madame D.”). It soon becomes apparent that M.G. is personally redefining “customer service”. He attempts to soothe her fearful intuition that they will never see each other again. They exchange “I love you”s, and he abruptly dispatches Madame D.’s driver to Lutz. As M. Gustave dictates to the lobby boy he suddenly realizes that he doesn’t know him.
16–19: Young Zero Moustafa’s interview begins. He has “zero” experience, education, or family, but impresses M.G. with a perfect answer to a deceptively tricky question.
19–20: Montage: Lobby Boy training begins. M. Gustave will be Zero’s counselor and guardian.
Zero performs the various and sundry tasks and duties of his position, anticipating the needs of the guests, with discretion as a guiding principle.
21–22: Zero begins to realize that, with respect to M. Gustave, “many of the guests came for him”, and that it “was also his pleasure.”
22–23: A day in the life, as Zero awakens in his tiny room and quickly grooms himself.Gustave sermonizes and recites from a small podium in the mess hall as the staff is served.
M.G. dines in a small room, nearly identical to Zero’s, but well-stocked with “L’air de Panache”.
23: Deputy Kovacs arrives to review the books with M. Gustave and business manager Herr Becker. Kovacs also conveys messages on behalf of the mysterious, unidentified owner of the GBH.
23–24: Introducing Agatha. Plain, graceful, seventeen years old, with a birthmark the shape of Mexico on the side of her face. She works a rolling pin in Mendl’s patisserie and has the air of a true artisan. She rides her bicycle through the town, a yoke bearing pink boxes balanced across her shoulders. Mr. Moustafa’s story ends abruptly: “ — but we won’t discuss that.”
Part 2: “Madame C.V.D.u.T.”
24–26: Carrying a stack of newspapers, Zero scans the headlines and comes to a stop. He dashes off to share the news with M. Gustave: Madame D. is dead. M.G.: “We must go to her.” He instructs Zero to pack quickly… and to bring a bottle of the Pouilly-Jouve ‘26.
26–31: As the train speeds toward Lutz, they sit in the first class cabin drinking chilled white wine. M.G. assesses the situation, particulary the disposition and motives of Madame D.’s family. He waxes philosophic, and rather bluntly discusses their physical intimacy.
The train comes to an abrupt halt in the middle of nowhere, and soldiers burst into their cabin. They ask them to produce papers, and briefly question Zero. M.G.’s charm offensive fails, and the soldiers sieze Zero against the protestations of his guardian. Cpt. Henckels arrives, having heard the commotion. He recognizes M. Gustave and apologizes, ordering his and Zero’s release. He gives Zero a temporary transit permit.
Gustave favorably notes the “faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity.”
31–34: They arrive in Lutz, at Madame D.’s mansion. Clotilde the maid attends to them.
Gustave surveys Madame D.’s corpse and expresses his admiration for her appearance. She has finally gotten in right… in death.
The butler M. Serge, via Clotilde, asks for a word with M.G. He and Zero wait for a moment for Serge, who is seen through the glass looking agitated and distraught.
34–39: M. Gustave impatiently marches into the Grand Hall, where relatives close and distant have gathered, their greed roused.
Kovacs enters and unceremoniously deposits onto a podium a large pile of documents that comprise Madame D.’s last will and testament. He sums up her intention as granting the bulk of the estate to Dimitri, her son, but then refers to an “additional codicil” recently received but not yet legally verified.
He reads the codicil: M. Gustave receives the priceless painting “Boy with Apple”.
Dimitri, outraged, confronts M.G., questioning both his intentions and his virility. A punchout, with the final blow struck by Dimitri’s muscle, Jopling.
39–42: M.G. goes to leave. Waiting again for the still agitated Serge, he piques Zero’s interest and they go to have a look at the painting. Zero suggests, first with his eyes, then by fetching a footstool, that possession is nine tenths of the law.
Serge wraps the painting for them, but not before surreptitiously inserting a letter marked “Confidential”. He remains cryptic, preferring to say no more. They depart for the train station.
42–44: In their train compartment at night, M. Gustave and Zero make a pact. They will sell “Boy with Apple”, with Zero to receive a commission, and then “lay low somewhere along the Maltese Riviera until the troubles blow over”. M.G. also bequeaths his belongings to Zero upon his death in exchange for Zero’s assistance.
44–45: Back at The Grand Budapest, they hide and lock up the painting. One of the bellboys advises that the police have arrived and are asking for M. Gustave. M.G. warns Zero to remain silent before the authorities. They announce his arrest. He acknowledges the murder, as if having suspected it, then suddenly bolts to escape. The policemen give chase.
Part 3: “Checkpoint 19 Criminal Internment Camp”
45–49: Zero visits M. Gustave, whose eyes are blackened. He has had to prove his virility to his new best friends.
Zero has spoken to Kovacs, who in flashback explains the theory of M.G.’s guilt to zero. Serge is revealed to have been the “witness” to M.G.’s illegal entry. Zero attempts to encourage M. Gustave and leaves him with a courtesan au chocolat from Mendl’s.
49–50: The dark, menacing Jopling visits the sister of Serge, looking for him. He continues his search by night, speeding through the city on his black motorcycle.
50–52: Zero reads a letter from M.G. to the staff, dictating his wishes and effectively managing the hotel from prison. Zero embodies the presence of M. Gustave, even taking the time to recite his tediously florid stanzas from the podium.
52–56: M. Gustave makes friends in prison, serving mush to a scar-faced giant, then sharing a beautiful, decadent Mendl’s pastry with Pinky and the gang. Ludwig sums up the physical challenges of an escape. They’ve found a possible way out, but need digging tools.
56: Returning to Mr. Moustafa, who cries as he recounts to the author the role Agatha played.
56–58: Zero and Agatha’s romance. He proposes, she accepts. He presents her with a gift of poetry.
58–59: M. Gustave interviews Agatha, ostensibly on Zero’s behalf. He playfully flirts with her and gives her gifts — a white porcelain pendant and five dozen white tulips — arousing Zero’s jealousy.
59–60: The equally brave and skilled Agatha hides digging tools in pastries so beautifully decorated that the “slice and dice” guard decides against damaging them with his cleaver.
60–62: Kovacs attempts to counsel Dimitri and family but they refuse his advice, uninterested in either the legal process or the intentions of the deceased. Jopling throws Kovacs’ cat out the window.
62: M. Gustave and the inmates are making progress, digging through the floor of their cell.
62–64: Zero sneaks into Agatha’s room and they share a couple’s moment together. He tells her of the stolen painting. She refuses to participate or even accept the note describing its location. He leaves it for her anyway.
64–66: Jopling rejoins his pursuit of Kovacs, following him to and through the darkened art museum. He slams shut an exit door, cutting off Kovacs’ escape route and his fingers, then delivers the death blow.
Later Herr Becker receives a message from the office of Kovacs, postponing their scheduled meeting indefinitely.
67–75: Zero arrives by bus to a dark, deserted roadside. He makes his way to an open area with a manhole, and seems to be waiting.
Lights out in the prison, and the inmates make their escape. M. Gustave’s large, scar-faced friend aides them by silencing a would-be whistle blower. One inmate loses his life as he assassinates three guards gathered around a card table.
They exit through the manhole, to the waiting Zero. M.G. introduces them all and begins to pontificate. The other three beat a hasty retreat to a waiting bus.
For his part, Zero has failed to secure a safe house, an escape route, and has even failed to bring the L’air de Panache. M.G. berates him, until Zero explains how he became a refugee. M.G. delivers a heartful apology on behalf of himself and the hotel, and reiterates to Zero and his affection for him. “We’re brothers”, says Zero.
Gustave makes a collect call to M. Ivan of…
Part 4: “The Society of the Crossed Keys”
76–78: The concierge fraternity jumps into action. A chain of phone calls. Each concierge drops what he is doing — whether giving directions, conducting a chorus of “Happy Birthday”, or administering emergency medical assistance — and delegates to his second in command. “Take over!”
78–81: M. Gustave assesses the situation and tries to make sense of it all, alongside a confused Zero. M. Ivan speeds into frame in his limo and spirits them away to the train station. The society has found Serge and a meeting with him has already been arranged. And M. Ivan has even brought the L’air de Panache.
81–83: Cpt. Henckels discovers their escape and gives “dragnet” instructions. Jopling also begins tracking them.
83–84: Dimitri orders Jopling to step up the aggression with Serge’s sister. He suddenly notices the obscene painting which has taken the place of “Boy with Apple”, and smashes it against a small marble statue.
84–86: M.G. puts Serge’s supposed betrayal in perspective. He expresses to Zero his admiration for Agatha and asks to officiate the wedding.
86–87: Alone in her room, Agatha packs. Hearing a noise, she sticks her head through the frame of the skylight. She sees nothing.
Henckels reads a headline “Young Girl’s Head Found in Laundry Basket”. The basket is brought to him. He reaches in and lifts out the head of Serge’s sister.
Part 5: “Gabelmeister’s Peak”
87–95: In the Alpine foothills, Jopling examines a bloodied document as a young attendant fuels up his motorcycle.
Soldiers catch the scent of L’air de Panache.
Zero and M. Gustave make for their high-altitude rendez-vous with Serge X. A monk instructs that they board the next cable car. Halfway up, another monk intercepts them and switches cable cars with the two, sending them off to the opposite peak. A third monk provides them with robes and bibles to join the choral assembly. The final monk send them to confess.
Serge sits opposite in the confessional box. He tells M.G. that there is a second will, and he has made a second copy. Suddenly his story is interrupted. He has been strangled by a now escaping Jopling.
95–99: As Jopling skis away, M.G. and Zero give chase by sled. They speed down the mountain, with Zero barely able to steer.
Jopling comes to the end of the run and watches as M. Gustave and Zero come barreling down, out of control, slamming into the snow bank at the bottom, then flying through the air. Zero lands head first in the snow, practically disappearing, and M. Gustave is nearly thrown off the edge of the cliff.
As M.G. dangles over the edge, Jopling fractures the ice with the heel of his boot. Graceful even in the face of death, M. Gustave’s poetic verses are rudely interrupted as Zero shoves Jopling off the mountain.
Henckels spots the fugitive and accomplice and warns them not to flee. They flee. Zero’s plan is to steal Jopling’s motorcycle, fetch Agatha, take back “Boy with Apple”, and head for the Maltese Riviera, once and for all. But first, a moment of silence for Serge.
99–109: Mr. Moustafa narrates: “The war began at midnight.” The lobby of the GBH is filled with fascists. It has become “a troops’ barracks”. “Z-Z” symbols are plastered everywhere.
Agatha makes a delivery of pink boxes for the soldiers as M. Chuck manages room logistics for his new guests.
Agatha, alone in the vault, follows Zero’s written instructions and retrieves the wrapped painting. Outside the hotel, M. Gustave and Zero observe from a Mendl’s truck. M.G. laments the state of the Grand Budapest under its new occupants. They watch with concern as Dimitri enters the hotel.
Agatha looks for an escape route, and bee-lines into the elevator, asking the operator for the top floor. Dimitri intercepts her and goes along for the ride, while she nervously avoids eye contact. He eyes the package she’s carrying and gingerly peels back the wrapping. “Boy with Apple”.
Gustave and Zero deliver another stack of pink pastry boxes courtesy of Herr Mendl. Dimitri follows Agatha off the elevator and she makes a break for it. He has lost her in the hallway. As M.G. and Zero step from the elevator Dimitri spots them and opens fire. A shootout ensues as soldiers step out from their rooms to enter the fray. Henckels calls for them to cease fire.
A scream. Agatha, and the painting, hang from the edge of the building. Zero leaps to save her, but overshoots and now dangles from the same railing. They are saved as they crash into the Mendl’s truck below.
She has noticed something on the back of the painting…
Part 6: “The Second Copy of the Second Will”
109–114: Madame D. left everything to M. Gustave: the mansion, the factories, a newspaper syndicate… and the GBH.
M.G. anoints Zero as his successor, the new concierge. He officiates the wedding of Zero and Agatha. Mr. Moustafa recounts how two years later Agatha and his infant son died from the ‘Prussian gripe’.
Zero and Agatha travel with M. Gustave by train toward Lutz. M.G. acknowledges his humble beginnings as a lobby boy, and that Zero finally surpassed him. Agatha recites a stanza about two brothers, “one from the east and one from the west”.
They are again stopped in the middle of nowhere by fascist thugs. This time they are not so lucky. The leader rips up Zero’s transit papers. M. Gustave steps up to defend him.
Back to 1965: Mr. Moustafa reveals that the soldiers shot him.
114–117: In summing up M. Gustave he echoes his mentor’s own words. “There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse once known as humanity. He was one of them.”
The author inquires hesitantly as to why Mr. Moustafa has traded a great fortune for this doomed hotel. He kept it for Agatha. Her crossed-keys pendant is pinned to his jacket.
The author sits alone writing in a small notebook.
“It was an enchanting old ruin, but I never managed to see it again.”
The author at seventy five sits alone writing in a small notebook.
Back to present day. The girl sits on a bench, finishing the final chapter of “The Grand Budapest Hotel”.

The most important thing I learned is that my Magyar definitely needs some work!
I also realized that I have accepted that certain cuisines are not globally popular for a good reason. I have disliked food from other countries but that was not the case in Hungary. I did not dislike it but I was not blown away with it either. Maybe I did not try all the right places but made an attempt based on TripAdvisor and Yelp reviews. When I travel with my son I prefer hotel rooms with Breakfast included because the little guy is not exactly the most patient toddler so that does remove one meal off any day.
That was the only thing about my trip that skews towards the disappointed side of a straight line so I started with it. Now lets move onto why Budapest is sooooo amazing because I loved generally everything else about it. I am writing this about a month after the trip but that is one memorable and beautiful city! If you have ever read about Budapest I am confident that the first thing you will read about is the attractiveness of the city. It’s like that pretty girl you can’t help but look more than once.
Ok so onto the trip, we stayed at the Budapest Marriott. It was an older looking hotel from the outside but the inside was great! If you enjoy views get a room with a view of the river. A disclaimer from me, I have a friend who got me a friends and family rate otherwise I probably would not have stayed at a non chain hotel because American chains are almost always more expensive than their local counterparts. The breakfast at the hotel tasted like Marriott food which means it was predictable but very good and expansive. Back to the view, awesome. My son featured in a great deal of pictures with it in the background and since I am an IPhone camera pro they obviously came out great and it was all my doing.
Moving on. The stuff I think I enjoyed the most with a young child was:
Budapest Castle,
walking down Andrassy Avenue to Heroe’s square,
the walk across the Chain bridge(or any bridge really across the Danube),
the city parks we stopped by,
There was also some spring festival type event going on at Vati Utca with music playing along with food and drink stalls that kept him occupied.
Finally my absolute favorite thing was Szechenyi baths and pools. So when you read on the internet you will get some confusing information about whether it is ok to take your children to the pools. Well here is the final word on that based on my personal experience so take it to the bank. If you kid is not a jerk you should be good to go! Here are the caveats because you knew they were coming. We only took the little guy into the HUGE pools. Basically here it is step by step, layman’s terms, if you will. You walk in and there are some counters where you buy tickets. It was packed when we went. They have a menu of options on these little flyers near those ticket counters in various languages so grab yours but regardless of what it says at minimum get a private cabin changing room. Quit being cheap. Its actually not crazy expensive but I think its the minimum for a basic level of comfort if you have a family. If your solo or with all adults maybe other options will work. The cabins are all over the damn place so an attendant will show you one and its basically a tiny little room you can change and store your stuff in. The storing stuff being important. Our umbrella stroller fit like a charm. The other thing is if your sharing cabins between people they are tiny so I would not recommend going in all at once. Anyways, once your ready you go through this huge complex which is all medicinal pools. We skipped all of those because they may or may not be good for a small toddler. When you get outside you’ll find the huge pools I mentioned. It was packed!! Heres the kicker…plenty of kids having a good time. Since you are in a crowded space you’ll probably want to keep the kiddos under control as not to disturb others but for the most part everyone seemed ok with it. If you want to check out the inside you can do what we did and go one by one while the other entertained. All in all great way to spend a day, experience something local, and entertain a rugrat. As if they knew what I was thinking I later saw in our hotel magazine(that one WHERE magazine thats in every room in every hotel, in every place ever), I seriously need to work for that company that sometimes they turn those polls into pool/club parties. EBC in Budapest if you will. I obviously didn’t attend but I would have. Ohhh, actually come to think of it we had a tough time finding a swim diaper for the little guy anywhere so we used the extra thick night diapers but were checking all the time to make sure he didn’t code brown or yellow so save some peace of mind and bring swim diapers!!
My other favorite thing was the hospital under the rock behind/under Budapest castle. This was a suggestion from my parents and what a cool if somewhat underfunded museum. Tickets were expensive but I think they had discounts for students or people who took the bus tour of the city. Incidentally, there seemed to be 3 big companies offering that tour. We took the red\yellow bus one and it was ok. It was just called the hop on\hop off tour. Bought the tickets at the hotel because they were the same price as the door which was surprising to me but they let me pay with my card so you know, points. The big bus tour company buses actually looked better to me from what I saw on the outside but since I did not experience it I can’t really say they are. Back to the museum, its all underground and basically they show you how they ran this intense hospital under the castle during war times. I usually get real yawny at museums but this one was cool if not depressing. One of those reflective, I am so glad to be born where and when I was born type moments(yay genetic lottery). My son happened to sleep through most of itso I don’t know how it would have been had be been awake but my guess is that it would have been fine since the space is tiny inside. Mostly would have had to keep him from touching everything.
Finally, we took a few Ubers to get to starting points but really your doing yourself an injustice if you don’t walk around everywhere. Quit being lazy.
Notes and recap:
Vati Utca — Its like a happening street with restaurants, shops, bars, etc. Touristy like any social area of any big city but if your reading this your probably a tourist.
Andrassy Avenue, think Rodeo Drive(not as expensive). Fancy shops, beautiful architecture, Mcdonalds, Burger King, and Starbucks. They also have the miniversum, this pretty cool tiny train museum which would be better if you could interact more with the trains rather than just watch them but from their perspective it would probably get destroyed really fast if they let that happen so never mind what I have to say. If you have kids they may enjoy checking it out. The play area in the back with some barely working trains was great for a toddler though. We sat there for 2 hours at least while the little guy went to town. My croc water sandal fell out of the stroller at the miniversum so if anyone finds it let me know!
Faust Winery — Found this place on tripadvisor. Like the hospital it is underground in a cavernous space under Budapest castle very close to the Hilton nearby. Really cool wine tasting experience. The couple that was running it were super friendly and seemed informed, not that I could have told you if they were not. I just tend to nod my head when someone asks if I am getting the fruity notes. I do like wine though so we tasted some really great local stuff. It was 20 bucks a head for 6 tastings and solid pours. A really cool date place from the look of it in case you happen to have a date in Budapest is my favorite way of describing it, plus a good chance the other person winds up a little buzzed so you will be more interesting without even trying! My one advice because its a real cool setting and you don’t want to be the people with children running around in there try to plan your tasting around a nap time. Its super chilly and dark in there so my little guy slept great in his stroller.
Tokaji — We did not actually go to the wine region because its a long car trip but totally doable for adults from what I could gather. Unreasonable with a little one so we did the next best thing. We bought and tasted a bunch. Tokaji is a sometimes sweet white wine that is delicious if you like that sort of thing. I do. The Mrs., not so much but since its my blog and not hers I think you should drink up as much as you can. They have a rating scale for them which obviously effects costs so you can read up on that if your interested. We tried a few at the Faust cellars mentioned above so maybe ask them what to get. Hungarian Wine ftw!
Thats all I have for now but any questions let me know and I can try to help. This was a on the surface first trip for me and I hope I get to make it back to explore more and maybe make it out to wine region. We had a blast in Mendoza, Argentina and honestly liked it better than Napa so I am always game for new regions revolving around booze.
I am a new writer but am enjoying it so far. People often ask me for travel advice so thought I would just make it public. Hopefully its simplified enough that the work is just done for you. That is the goal at least. I am sure it will be a work in progress. I will also post them to my blog at www.jaideeps.com. Sign up, I have some other topics too that I enjoy writing about especially as I learn more about them. Hope of one of them makes life easier for you!

People always ask me for travel advice since I travel frequently for leisure. Never wrote it down before! Beyond that I also write about anything I’m working on

Wes Anderson’s picture book masterpiece for the ages
Last Saturday I revisited the unloved Christopher Nolan masterpiece The Prestige and last night, with the now inevitable drawing in of the heatwave summer nights, I continued with an aged custom of my “Saturday Night Film Club” and treated myself to another trip to The Grand Budapest Hotel. As you will gather if you read the entirety of the opus blog article I’ve gratuitously plugged and linked to the end of this opening paragraph, I’m rather in love with the films of Wes Anderson and my love-in articles on Isle of Dogs (2018) and The French Dispatch (2021) can also be found deep within my film archives.
No great revelations here. No deep dive into the merits of a masterpiece that only time and an open consciousness will appreciate.
Just oodles of love for a cinematic masterpiece and a gratuitous plug for a film article I wrote many years ago?
As the inhabitants of the Coen Brothers film Fargo would say
“You Betcha!”
medium.com
“I’m afraid that’s me darling!”
I consider myself very fortunate to see Wes Anderson’s eighth film just after opening night at my local picture house and instantly fell in love with it. For personal reasons only I rank it second in my all time personal favourite films of his but sixteen years after Rushmore it truly runs it close for my all time favourite. The Grand Budapest Hotel is far more elegant, poetic and picturesque than Rushmore and I adore the comic book/picture book feel of the film. It’s timeless flow and imagination makes an instant re-watching an easy decision, especially when you consider the film itself is almost a film within a film, within a film. The three separate time periods of 1985, 1968 and 1932 flow together seamlessly and whilst the film may be predominantly set in the 1930’s the movements forward in time are never jarring or awkward and simply add to the majesty of this wonderful film. As I write this ode to joy on 1st October 2014 the Oscar buzz has not yet started but surely this is the breakthrough film of Oscar recognition Wes Anderson has thoroughly deserved since the eponymous Rushmore sixteen long years ago. Whilst Oscars are not the yardstick by which to measure a film’s success, we can but hope.
The film is inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig (who is thanked in the closing credits) but Anderson and fellow writer Hugo Guinness deserve an Oscar nomination for their surreal screenplay and for the poetic, dancing dialogue given to Ralph Fiennes and Jeff Goldblum, both of whom pull of their linguistic treats to perfection but more of this later. Robert Yeoman’s cinematography is again inspired, adding to the picture book texture of the film and combined with Adam Stockhausen’s production design and miniature models provide so many endearing and effective cinematic shots that deserve Oscar recognition in 2015 but the same can be said for Milena Canonero’s wonderful array of costumes that truly are a centre piece of the film, Anna Pinnock’s set decoration and Stephen Gessler’s art direction are all worthy of recognition and in Oscar circles, if it’s The Grand Budapest’s year in 2015, all will be worthy recipients of the prized statue. The film is such an incredible achievement Wes Anderson’s entire behind the scenes crew deserve special praise for realising an astonishing looking film that enchants you with every watch, but a final nod goes to Film Editor Barney Pilling for weaving together three differing timelines, so many narrative strands and of course, the long held Wes Anderson trademarks which proliferate the film and work so wonderfully well as ever.
In front of the camera is a real ensemble cast of returning actors from previous Anderson films or A-List first timers that each portray highly original character creations that I will briefly appraise below. But to whet your appetite we have, in no particular order: a dastardly double dealing Frenchman, a vicious German enforcer, a spurned son, a pompous writer, a heavily tattooed yet loquacious prison inmate, an equally loquacious lawyer, a bizarre local Captain of the Military, a beautiful pastry chef, several surreal concierges, one strident, wistful, foul mouthed yet sweet tongued lothario who also occasionally acts as a concierge, oh, and a Lobby Boy named Zero! All of whom are in the very capable hands of Ralph Fiennes, Adrien Brody, Bill Murray, F Murray Abraham, Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Mathieu Amalric, Edward Norton, Jude Law, Saoirse Ronan, Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson, Tony Revolori, and returning favourites Owen Wilson and Jason Schwartzman.
The opening frame of the film sets the tone and immediately you’re aware this is a Wes Anderson film. All three time periods of 1985, 1968 and 1932 were shot in different aspect ratios to suitably reflect the change in period so don’t adjust your set! The film has a continuing narration throughout however the narrator changes with the time period and firstly in 1985 we have the bizarre spectacle of “Author” (Tom Wilkinson) narrating direct to camera whilst being shot at by his son with an air gun!. We now jump back to 1968 and the second of our narrators “Young Writer” (Jude Law) who details the demise of the once opulent and highly regarded Grand Budapest Hotel, located in Zubrowka, a fictional European town high in the hills and formerly a hive of activity that attracted only the very wealthy prior to the outbreak of war in the 1930’s. But here in 1968 it is now rather decrepit and a monument to a bygone age but which still retains it character and remnants of it’s more luxurious past and now houses singular visitors who keep themselves to themselves whilst passing through. The Young Writer is wont to stand “elbow to elbow” of an evening with “M.Jean” (Jason Schwartzman) the hotel’s current incumbent in the role of concierge and the returning Schwartzman is excellently bizarre in a small cameo role. M.Jean alerts the young writer to the exception to the visitors who pass nominally through the hotel, “Mr Moustafa” (F Murray Abraham) the current owner of the hotel, and through “fate” the young writer is able to ask the scene setting question to Mr Moustafa of how he came to own such a grand building with such grand history and with such a grand tale to tell? The particular tale Mr Moustafa tells is of intrigue, suspense, murder, philandering and of colourful characters in very colourful and bizarre circumstances. It’s also a tale of young love, a Lobby Boy named Zero and a loquacious concierge who came to own the priceless painting of “Boy With Apple” and the story is told, indeed narrated, over an evening meal between the two men as they dine in the huge, imposing dining hall of the Grand Budapest Hotel.
Wes Anderson’s masterpiece is split into five parts (each with it’s own title slide naturally) and are occasionally preceded by a slight change in the colour palette of the film. All Anderson hallmarks are present and correct: overhead shots, extreme close ups on books, paintings, newspapers, sepia tinged photographs, together with beautiful rolling camera shots, surreal inserts (look out for the cloakroom ticket!), plus there’s the obligatory “man hanging out of a window” shot that has appeared in nearly all of his films. The picture book style of the film is an absolute joy, the narrative blending with the bizarre character creations perfectly and every frame has been meticulously planned to the nth degree. But what impresses me time and time again in Anderson’s eight cinematic offering are the small segments of scenes not seen in his previous works. The multi doors sweeping open as we approach the reading of the will and “Zero” (Tony Revolori) about to commence the obligatory reading of the concierge letter and poem before the staff’s evening meal but an instant cutaway to an imprisoned “M.Gustave” (Ralph Fiennes) and his surreal reading of the letter whilst surrounded by unemotional fellow inmates and prison officers are two examples of many. The chase in the Kunstmuseum is just phenomenal and a credit to the genius Director of Photography Robert Yeoman, as is the prison escape sequence and only surpassed by the acting and prose delivered by Tony Revolori and Ralph Fiennes at it’s touching, yet amusing denouement.
These are but minor examples of so many brilliant scenes devised and shot through the prism of Messrs Anderson and Yeoman lens but even these are topped by a Wes Anderson staple, but with a twist! The film’s touching love story centres on Zero and the beautiful “Agatha” (Saoirse Ronan) and during their early courtship they enjoy a merry-go-round ride that is simply shot and ended with an Anderson hallmark of a straight on extreme close up on Agatha but rather than an unemotional shot (as is the norm) she is bright eyed and smiling. All five parts or acts of the film are an absolute joy, and here’s a very brief dissection of a very colourful cast of characters:
“M.Gustave” (Ralph Fiennes) Busy yet meticulous concierge of The Grand Budapest Hotel in the 1930’s who has a penchant for fine wine, blonde haired older ladies and L’air de Penache’. Has a wonderful linguistic use of English and a lothario who calls everyone, regardless of sex, as “darling”.
A stellar performance worthy of a 2015 Oscar.
“Zero” (Tony Revolori) Zero experience and zero family and friends. Deeply in love with his beloved Agatha but don’t you dare flirt with her! Following numerous roles in TV and short films, this is Tony’s first major role and many more are sure to follow this accomplished performance.
“Young Writer” (Jude Law) Well spoken writer, English Gentleman, European traveller and one of the film’s numerous narrators who’s told an incredible tale in an incredible dining room in an incredible film.
A cameo yet important role from Law.
“Mr Moustafa” (F Murray Abraham) Quiet and unassuming owner of The Grand Budapest Hotel who remains utterly devoted to Agatha, deeply misses his “Agatha” and has an intriguing tale to tell. It maybe a cameo role but it’s F Murray Abraham — what else do you need to know?
“Agatha” (Saoirse Ronan) Owner of Zero’s heart, saviour and bravest of the film’s eclectic and surreal cast of characters and she’s far more than a mere “pastry chef”. Atonement, The Lovely Bones and now The Grand Budapest Hotel, Ronan’s star is on the rise and justifiably so.
“Henckels” (Edward Norton) Surreal Captain of the Local Military who is big on moustaches, quizzical looks and very definitely not “Little Albert” anymore! A priceless cameo from the ever dependable Edward Norton.
“Nobody move. Everybody’s under arrest!”.
“Ludwig” (Harvey Keitel) Heavily tattooed prison inmate who can see the vulnerability of their “flophouse” and impresses M.Gustave with his artistic talents. Only included here as he’s a cherished actor I greatly admire and can drive any distance in just nine minutes and thirty seven seconds!
“Deputy Kovacs” (Jeff Goldblum) An eloquent, elegant and operatic cameo from a deadpan and utterly brilliant Goldblum as a conflicted but straight as a die lawyer. But please, don’t mention his cat!
“Dmitri” (Adrien Brody) Angry, very, very angry spurned son of a wealthy departed blonde lady who’s missing a priceless painting. As eloquent as his fellow characters but with a rather more foul mouth than the rest, even in front of his sisters! Yet another superb performance from Brody in an Anderson film.
“Jopling” (Willem Dafoe) Ruthless family enforcer who is also a remarkably accomplished motorbike rider and Olympic skier! An almost wordless performance but there’s nothing quiet or subtle about Jopling’s methods of disposal. Another returnee to an Anderson film and another accomplished and important cameo from Dafoe.
Supporting these premier roles are many more fleeting and cameo roles from Mathieu Amalric as a strangely staring French concierge “Serge X”, Bill Murray as the ever helpful “M.Ivan”, Jason Schwartzman as the comical concierge “M.Jean”, Tilda Swinton as the ill fated and fabulously wealthy “Madame D”, Owen Wilson as concierge “M.Chuck”, Florian Lukas as “Pinky”, Karl Markovics from the utterly brilliant and highly recommended film of 2007 The Counterfeiters as “Wolf”, a returning Bob Balaban as “M.Martin” and fellow returnees to a Wes Anderson film of Wallace Wolodarsky as concierge “M.George” and Waris Ahluwalia as concierge “M.Dino”.
A truly stellar ensemble cast in a wonderfully spellbinding film that showcases the very best in the Director of this magnum opus of a love in, Wes Anderson. I cannot recommend his films enough and The Grand Budapest may be his best yet and come 2015, hopefully he will receive further Oscar recognition to go with this particular film fan’s total admiration for his vision and desire to produce visually stunning pieces of cinematic art.

While writing and researching in Budapest last year, we ate a couple of times at a local restaurant that takes enormous pride in its food and service (Kispiac) and went there for our last evening meal before leaving Budapest.
The owner asked us about our time in Budapest and whether we’d like to return. Before we left, he came out with a bottle of Hungarian sparkling tokaji as a going away gift. Whilst Hungarians are rarely effusive, we found them helpful and generous — I can’t imagine that kind of gesture from a London restaurant after a couple of visits.
Budapest is an extraordinary place — there’s a quiet kindness in so many people — unshowy, but vital. There’s also deep melancholy — a history replete with suffering and ongoing political corruption and extremism.
It’s a place where beautiful Art Nouveau buildings are sometimes fading and uncared for. There are architectural gems are so in need of restoration that chunks of masonry fall into the street (we saw two passers-by almost felled by falling stone). And yet there’s also pride in good service and good food, in art and architecture, in being humane.
When I arrived, one of the themes in my novel was the debate over whether Attila József committed suicide or died in a tragic accident. The preponderance of opinion has always been that his death was by suicide, but I wanted to leave the question open, to stay with the ambiguity.
A conversation with László Kúnos of Corvina Press convinced me otherwise. Sad as it is to believe that this exceptional man chose to kill himself, the more I read the poetry and biographies, the more I realised that there is an internal logic to the life and death.
This is a scene when I’ve explored this in the novel:
She walks back slowly. She will go to the place where he wrote when editing the magazine, Beautiful Word, another day, but the statue on the Danube near the Parliament building is only a short detour on the route to her apartment.
József sits, coat thrown down beside him, hat in his hand, watching the river, the epitome of contemplation and lament. He looks as though he’d spent the day walking across this city searching for something, Catherine thinks. The lines from ‘By the Danube’ are in a facsimile of József’s handwriting: Mintha szivembôl folyt volna tova Zavaros, bölcs és nagy volt a Duna — As if it flowed straight from my heart / Troubled, wise and great was the Danube.
How was it that Székely translated those lines? Catherine asks the statue.
As if my own heart had opened its gate:
The Danube was turbulent, wise and great.
She thinks of the conversation with Margit and András, how a thing mutates between languages, but even in one language how every action, every nuance is open to interpretation.
Catherine sits on the bottom step beneath Attila, looking towards the Danube with him. When she begins to feel stiff and colder she walks towards the figure, touches his hand.
There is such melancholy here, she tells him. Suicide seems to be everywhere, your language is unlike any neighbouring country’s, your borders have changed, to say there has been one too many invasion is an understatement and even your national anthem talks of pity and sorrow. So much sadness and I have endless questions for you that you can’t answer. Did you kill yourself? I’m minded to agree with Margit and András that you did. Why didn’t you take another route? And the strangest question of all — Did you know a woman called Selene Solweig Virág?
At the Attila József Museum, I was further convinced that the poet took his own life. We took a tram to the south of the city to the IXth District. It was the most run-down area we visited and a shock after the picturesque tram-ride along the Danube. It was a blazing hot day and we were glad to find that museum after only ten minutes walking.
When we found the museum there seemed to be no way in, but after a rather halting phone call a curator let us in. We weren’t charged the entrance fee and had the museum to ourselves for two hours. The curator was helpful and delighted to have visitors. All this investment and care and no-one there.
The place was beautifully presented, tiny yet brimming with photos, artefacts and interactive displays. There are first edition copies of his collections, the pencil he wrote with, notebooks, letters and a copy of his birth certificate.
Attila could fall in love in minutes and does so with my character, Selene, who never appears in the histories or photographs as she is not from the same time as Attila. She may be imagining her relationship with him during the trauma of her imprisonment after the 1956 Uprising. Or perhaps not? Either way, she fits the pattern of József’s often unrequited and always difficult love life.
Ah, Catherine? the curator asks. I am with you.
Márta Tákacs appears moments later and Catherine holds out her hand to shake. They walk through a small courtyard and into the ground floor two-roomed apartment, Marta tall and elegant, her fair hair held behind a blue band that matches her eyes.
People come from everywhere, Márta says as they enter.
The walls are covered in black and white photographs. Catherine notes the picture of József’s father in military uniform that she has a copy of and one of his mother that she has not seen previously. Borbála is young and pretty, with soft features. Another image shows a house further along the street where the family lived when József was a toddler — It says: Papa disappeared from this flat, Márta says, translating legend.
By the door a map shows another nineteen apartments that the family lived in after Attila ran back to his mother from the foster family at Öcsöd, who set him to work as a five-year-old swineherd.
They were constantly thrown out for not being able to pay the rent, Márta tells her. Attila was lucky that later his brother-in-law paid for his education so he didn’t have to go on sell newspapers for a living. In his childhood, he’d already known work — collecting coal, selling paper whirligigs that he made from scraps to better-off children. In the war he’d queue all night to buy food for the family, only to find that the cooking lard had run out and there was nothing to be had by eight in the morning. He was only fourteen when his mother died and Makai sent him to the Makó boarding school. They tried to send him to a seminary too, but he left after a week, telling them he was Orthodox, not Catholic. He got good grades at school, but he was already suffering with depression and tried to kill himself when he was only sixteen. I will leave you to look, she says finally, but I’m in the next room if you have questions.
There are copies of József’s poetry collections on a small table, beginning with Szépség koldusa, Beauty’s Beggar, written when he was seventeen. Catherine lingers over each picture, each book, but feels no sense of Attila in the rooms.
After a while Márta reappears with a set of pictures. These were his women, she says. This one was the daughter of the director of his boarding school — Márta Gebe. He was very young, but she inspired several poems. Then Maria Esprit, this time his landlord’s daughter. And this one is most interesting.
The black and white picture is of a beautiful girl, aquiline features, large eyes, her close-cut bobbed hair under a fashionable cap.
Luca Wallennsz was the daughter of Gitta Genes, a very fine artist and ceramicist. There are beautiful works in the National Gallery. Her husband wrote novels and poetry. Very refined Jewish family. They gave salons and many famous names were there, but Gitta met Attila first in the park. He sat next to her on a bench and declared his love five minutes later. He was only nineteen and she was a mature woman, beautiful, but thirty-six. They became close — not what we would call an affair, but a relationship still. He wrote poems for her, of course, like ‘It was summertime’ and then her daughter, Luca, became interested in the salons and Attila fell in love once more. He wrote her many excellent poems, mostly in ’28. Very beautiful — ‘I bless you with sadness and happiness’ is best known of them, set to music often.
He fell in love often, Catherine notes.
Indeed. And he loved Gitta and Luca at the same time too.
Ah, Catherine says, thinking of Attila loving Flóra and Selene simultaneously.
You will know this one, of course.
Catherine holds the picture of Márta Vágó. Yes. The first serious love of his life, perhaps.
Márta nods. They wrote every day when she first went to London, but the distance was too much to sustain. I think that’s what her parents hoped for. They were wealthy intelligentsia, he was the son of a soap factory worker and a peasant, after all. Márta pauses. And this one –
She hands Catherine an image of Judit Szánto.
I always think the most sad, Márta finishes. She lived with him six years, tried to make a place of security for him. He was very broken after the relationship with Márta Vágó ended. But he said it was ‘not love, but an alliance’. Particularly harsh from a man who loved easily. He wrote one poem, ‘Judit’ and a few scraps that never became poems, that was all. While he was with Judit he met Edit.
Márta hands her the photograph of Edit Gyömrői. She was his doctor and he became … she searches for the word … fixated on her so that another doctor, Robert Bak, had to take over.
And then one day he saw this girl, Márta Márton –
Catherine studies the beautiful young face.
He didn’t know her. He saw her and decided he was in love. He wrote the poem ‘Ode’ for her, an exquisite love poem, and when Judit realised that she was not the muse of this poem, she tried to kill herself. They’d already tried to part earlier, but broke apart after this.
An finally –
The last picture is of Flóra Kozmutza. No picture of Selene, Catherine thinks.
They met at Anna Daniels apartment in February ’37 and were engaged by April, but it was never to be of course.
Catherine nods. Thank you. They’re all so beautiful.
Yes, lovely but sad, Márta adds.
After our final dinner at Kispiac, we walked to the Danube, sat by Attila’s statue and read some of his poetry, including ’By the Danube’.
I very much hoped it would be ‘au revoir’, and not goodbye. And I’m now looking forward to launching the novel in Budapest in November, at the wonderful Massolit bookshop and cafe.
By the Danube.
1.
As I sat on the bottom step of the wharf,
A melon-rind flowed by with the current;
Wrapped in my fate I hardly heard the chatter
Of the surface, while the deep was silent.
As if my own heart had opened its gate:
The Danube was turbulent, wise and great. …

First thing’s first, what’s your name and how old are you?
Julia, 31 years old.
And what do you do, workwise?
Director of Sales at Craft Travel Group.
What was it that attracted you to Nomad House (or coliving in general)?
The chance to visit Budapest and experience a co-living retreat.
Where were you before joining?
All over! In between Miami (my “home”), Madrid, New York and Rio de Janeiro…but I came to Budapest after 3 weeks in Barcelona/Madrid
What advice have you found most helpful, since beginning to travel and work remotely?
Try to establish some sort of routine. Find one place you can work from where you know internet will be good and you’ll have limited distractions. Find one other person who is also looking to get shit done and partner up with them. If you are like me and get distracted by just about anything, you’ll need to try extra hard while traveling to be productive because there is ALWAYS something going on.
Which lessons will you be taking from Nomad House?
So many! First off, it’s amazing how many different people I met from all over with all different interests. I would have never met these people under other circumstances and I’m SO glad I did. I learned so much on both a personal and professional level by living and traveling with this talented, diverse group of like-minded wanderlusters. So I suppose the main lesson would be to always be open-minded and take risks. I signed up to NH Budapest without any idea as to what I was getting into. But it ended up being one of the best weeks of my life.
How has Nomad House shaped your future?
Being around people with so many different professional backgrounds and talents really helped me identify my own strengths and learn from theirs. For example, in talking so much about different ideas and projects I discovered during the retreat that I was much more creative and that I have more entrepreneurial qualities than I thought previously. And by learning about others’ backgrounds I could identify the skills that I definitely DON’T have and understand them a bit better so I would know what/who to look for when pursuing future projects.
How do you feel about this lifestyle now — how do you think it will grow, and will you be trying more coliving programs in the future?
100% more convinced that my life will always involve some mix of co-living/retreat/nomadic activity for the foreseable future. :)
And a quickfire round…
Describe your gear setup [what do you take with you, your essential ‘in kit’ items]
Protein bars- they are my travel must-have because nobody wants to see me cranky. Also sneakers and headphones so I can go running or workout anywhere. And some sleeping pills for those long flights.
Describe your essential apps.
WhatsApp, RunKeeper, American Airlines (I’m obsessive about my Executive Platinum status), Splitwise (discovered during NH Budapest), and of course Tinder. :)
Describe your travel stack [your preferred websites for booking travel].
Kayak, Skyscanner, AA.com
Where can people get in touch with you?
Instagram @julia.crafted, or Craft’s website.

Let me start with the obvious; the colour grading is so unique in its pastel flavours whilst the cinematography is so very peculiar it is almost impossible for these 2 productions to be anything other than engaging, however, even more than this, it is the premise of these 2 films that make them so immensely beautiful to watch. Let me explain.
What truly makes Moonrise kingdom and Grand Budapest Hotel so interesting, engaging and unique is the fact that their storylines are based on delving into the real grit of people with life choices and occupations that we simply don’t think about. Anderson manages to turn what appear like random, uninteresting occupations such as Khaki Scouts and Hotel Bell Boy’s into the premise of his films, and he makes them look so exceptionally interesting.
By the end of the films, you truly believe that it would be exciting and thrilling to be the bell boy of a prestigious yet almost chaotic hotel, or a member of a scout group so regimental it makes school look like an atrocity. By giving small, seemingly unimportant jobs a real and professional status, it allows us as the audience to understand what it must feel like to belong to a group who take even the lightest job as a strict routine that must be followed. That has power.
As a viewer, it makes me wish I had as much passion and discipline as to carry out my job in the way Anderson manages to portray the characters within his film. And that’s what film is all about; allowing the viewer to escape to a reality that they cannot possibly escape to in real life. Without Moonrise Kingdom and The Grand Budapest Hotel, I would not have given hotel staff or scout groups a second thought, and now, I see their lives and their stories as so interesting and different, I can’t help but think of an alternative reality whereby I venture into these professions; but hey, maybe I’ve been watching too much Rick and Morty.

Budapest is in the top 3 best European cities where to party.
Just ask the countless bachelors bringing all their friends over from London for a wild weekend. Or the Erasmus students going crazy on a regular Monday night. Or basically, any young people living in Budapest.
The reason: lots of cool bars + cheap alcohol.
Out of these bars, many of them are ruin pubs, run-down places that emerged from the ruins of ancient buildings and are now one of the most iconic symbols of Budapest.
I am Portuguese but I lived in Budapest for 3.5 years. Pandemic times aside, I explored the nightlife of my beloved home away from home, always arriving home at the end of the night with the same feeling “This is the coolest city in Europe”.
So here are my recommendations for anyone wanting to explore the best bars in Budapest!
The first and most iconic ruin bar of Budapest. Going to Budapest and not visiting Szimpla is like going to Rome and not seeing the Pope. If going out is not your thing, try it during the day, when it’s quiet and you can simply admire the place, or on Sunday morning, when the place hosts a Farmers…

“Is it Paris or is it communist Russia? Who knows?!” Colin Hanks
These days, thanks to lower wages and a lower cost of living — and studio heads’ need for more money — there’s a lot of Hollywood production in Hungary. On any given night, some celebrity or muckety-muck can be found sipping palinka at the Four Seasons Hotel bar or wandering along the Danube. I’m here because my husband is working on a television show, our apartment’s Apple TV still has Eddie Redmayne’s login info and I know what Colin Hanks said about Budapest because my friend ran into him here, he was nice, they chatted, he described this place perfectly.
The comparison to Paris is obvious: classic pre-war buildings on either side of a glorious river spanned by majestic bridges. Communism lingers in the depressing grey concrete buildings shoved between old elegant ones and the unsmiling faces seen on the street.
But when I heard this quote, my first thought wasn’t architecture or national character, it was bread. Budapest’s bread and pastries are — for real — better than bread and pastries in Paris.
I swear. But just in case my taste buds or memory had gone awry, I went to Paris to test my hypothesis. Any excuse to mow down more flour, sugar and butter than any…

Our two heroes, concierge extraordinaire Monsieur Gustav H (Ralph Finnes) and his lobby boy protégé Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori), sit across the table from each other in a moving railcar headed to the memorial of the tragically deceased Dowager Countess Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton). The mysterious old woman, a close friend (and frequent lover) of M. Gustav, had feared her death was imminent just three months prior, though specifically what she knew remains unclear. In her wake, the vultures are coming, ready to pick apart her financial corpse and no leave aspect of her estate unclaimed. Gustav, however, comes as a dove wishing to pay respect to the woman and ensure that she is as beautiful in death as she was in during her last stay at the Grand Budapest Hotel in Zubrowka. But before they reach their destination the train comes to an abrupt stop in a barley field, invaded by Zig Zag Stormtroopers looking for undesirables which, it seems, includes Zero. It takes Gustav both his tenacity and his previous kindness to the mother of the Zig Zag commander to earn protection for the young refugee. A woman is dead, and Europe seems to be following.
In 1914, Gavrilo Princip’s bullets struck Austria-Hungary’s Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie. They would die together as their car sped away on the streets of Sarajevo, the first domino in a long chain to fall that would lead to The Great War, ending true monarchy in Europe in just four years’ time, and shattering the continent’s economy and stability in the process. The rise of fascism that followed, in hindsight, seems inevitable. By 1945, the Second World War would be fought on many of the same battlefields, an attempt to push back against the totalitarian evils of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, and while the Allied resistance would ultimately win it came at a grave cost — before the midpoint of the twentieth century, Eastern European culture as we knew it was destroyed, replaced with a brutalist architecture and new forms of totalitarianism in the form of Soviet expansion.
When Wes Anderson’s 2014 masterpiece The Grand Budapest Hotel begins, we are not with Gustav at the grand chateau atop the mountain, but in a cemetery after the aforementioned Soviet Union itself has fallen. A young girl has come to visit the grave of a renowned Author (only known as such, played by the great Tom Wilkinson). She greatly admires a book of his and starts to read at the gravesite, one that was written in 1985 about a time in 1968 when he himself visited the titular hotel after its character and history were stripped in favor of the aesthetic du jour in Eastern Europe. No longer does the exterior resemble the pink majesty on the film’s poster, nor does the interior suggest an opulence reserved for royalty. Even the film’s aspect ratio has changed, from a small letterbox to a widescreen vantage like many of the historical epics being made at the time, only serving to contrast the drab and dreary nature of the establishment. The closest thing to culture or opulence we can spot is a painting of a boy holding an apple at the concierge desk.
It is at the hotel that the Author, now portrayed by Jude Law, spies an older gentleman (F. Murray Abraham) sitting patiently for no one in the lobby. When the author inquires about him, all he is told is that the man is the owner of the hotel and that he only stays once or twice a year, and even then, refuses to stay anywhere but a small room with a cot. The two meet in the baths (covered with grimy tile rather than elegant marble) and agree to join each other for dinner. It is there, in a large and empty dining hall, that the old man decides to tell the story of his time as a young lobby boy named Zero, his mentorship under the tutelage of the incredible and indelible Gustav H, and how the hotel came to be in his name.
As we see his story we realize how truly great the Grand Budapest Hotel once was, with its raised balconies, elegant carpentry, vaulted staircases, and chandeliers galore. The clientele is comprised of the world’s upper crust, coming from far and wide to experience the best Zubrowka has to offer, and the staff make it their mission to ensure they get it. The film is now in the nearly-square Academy ratio (again, like the films of its time), turning the wide realism into a jewel box we can’t help but admire. But underneath the majesty is an obvious melancholy, that throughout this fictional tale of excitement and adventure, prison breaks and murder, we are also seeing what we lost when Europe set itself on fire.
Let’s forget, for a second, that the sovereign nation of Zubrowka and the Zig Zag forces are entirely fictional and, instead, recognize the real-world counterparts they represent — Eastern Europe and Nazi Germany, respectively. When most of us today think of the latter we, correctly, picture a fascist, totalitarian, and extremely oppressive regime responsible for the decimation and destruction of numerous minority communities throughout the continent, most notably Jews and Romani. When we think of the former, however, we usually picture a more run-down, war-torn part of the world replete with brutalist architecture, grey skies, and impoverished citizens (like the hotel of the ‘60s). It has been the butt of many jokes throughout Western pop culture, my personal favorite being the incredibly exaggerated Bratislava sequence in 2004’s Eurotrip. It is important to remember, though, that this idea we have of a large swath of Europe is only part of the story and a small one at that. The current state of Eastern Europe is a direct aftermath of two global wars, along with further Soviet occupation and smaller conflicts in places like Bosnia and, most recently, Ukraine. One of the great tragedies of our time, and the main one The Grand Budapest is grappling with, is how much of that region’s culture has been lost, bulldozed, and forgotten in the wake of conflagration.
World War I was a knotty, complicated conflict with no clear good or bad guys to pick from (though much of the allied West was keen to point the finger at Germany and their Kaiser, who they already hated anyway). With two bullets fired from a young man’s gun and the month of confusion that immediately followed, all of Europe’s longstanding treaties and agreements, the same ones that had prevented full-scale continental war throughout a perilous and tumultuous nineteenth century, drove every nation in the area into hell. Young men were enlisted on the promise of national pride only to be used as machine gun fodder in the unmoving trenches in Belgium. Others were sent to Arabia in an attempt to push back the already sickly Ottoman Empire not to liberate the locals but to create desert empires of their own. By the time America was dragged in to help the English and French secure victory from the face of otherwise sure stalemate, all of Europe’s true monarchies had fallen and every nation had, on some level, lost. It was supposed to be “the war to end all wars”, but the emotional crater it left was the perfect cauldron to breed hatred and resentment, and the inevitable power struggle commenced.
Smartly, Grand Budapest is primarily set in 1932, nearly smack dab in between the two world wars. The imagery in the costume and production design is most obviously that of the second, but I believe that much of the early story is actually referencing the first. In that war, despite the hellish destruction, there was a pretend air of dignity attached. When Gustav and Zero are first accosted near a barley field the decorum and history between the commander and the concierge allows for safe passage (presumably in both directions). But when they arrive at the estate it is immediately clear that something is amiss, and the staff is ushering our two heroes away for a private discussion.
What is taking place, as we will soon learn, is a quick reading of the dowager countess’s will, which leaves the bulk of her estate to her ungrateful children — all except the painting “Boy with Apple”, which has been bequeathed to a one M. Gustav H. Much like Europe in the wake of WWI, unhappy with whatever lot they were left with, so, too, is Céline’s son and chief heir, Dmitri (Adrian Brody). Not only is he furious that he wouldn’t receive the entire estate in full, but that even a sliver of it should go to a man far below his station (and, adding insult to injury, the man she was having a lurid affair with). The rest of the film is, essentially, the remnants of the old-world empires grasping at every ounce of power they can and refusing to allow anyone from a lower class to have even a sliver. All Gustav wants is the painting, and many will die in Dmitri’s attempt to get it back.
By compressing the larger time period into a short year, Anderson presents a crisscrossing subtext with numerous overlaps. In our world, the period between the two world wars allowed for the larger societal dissatisfaction to curdle into outright hatred and destructive nationalism. In the film, it happens all at once, with Dmitri using the increasingly oppressive Zig Zag corps to place Gustav in prison for a murder that the son himself almost certainly committed (Céline’s) — the ZZ is more than happy to play along to continue aligning itself with wealth and power. The allegory there is pretty simple as this is, effectively, what happened in Germany as soon as it was clear that the Nazi party was gaining insurmountable ground in the political sphere. Better to team up and consolidate rather than fight back.
What followed, tragically, was the Holocaust — a decade-long massacre across Europe that claimed the lives of an estimated 6 million Jews and millions of others based solely on their religion, ethnicity, political stances, or sexual orientation. Much of Eastern European culture, particularly Polish and Czech, was expressly suppressed and overtaken by the Aryan Reich — what was originally there was deemed too intellectual, too ephemeral, too Jewish. When we return to the hotel in the movie’s third act we see that nearly every shred of pink and rose and red, the ornate nature of the palatial estate we marveled at earlier on, is covered in black banners with ZZ logos. The total decimation of the structure has not yet taken place (the version of the hotel we see in widescreen), but the first attempt is apparent. Rather than tear down and rebuild in their own image, ZZ would rather cover up and pretend it was always theirs.
Working backward, it is no surprise that the monastery in the mountains provides little more than a detour, pretending to help Gustav and Zero find the one informant who can clear the concierge’s name (and, we will learn, knows about the contents of a secret will that has been hidden within the sought-after portrait). Instead, they are so ineffectual as to allow Dmitri’s bodyguard and hitman, J. G. Jopling (Willem Dafoe), to murder Madame D’s butler, Serge X (Mathieu Amalric), inside of a confessional. An irony, to be sure, but one also not without its real-world parallels like everything else.
The rise of fascism in Germany and Italy is a seminal tragedy borne in the wake of another, but we shouldn’t ignore the power structures that refused to stand in their way. And while the already rich and powerful certainly have gotten their due blame, a key group that gets largely forgotten in their culpability is the Catholic Church. The Vatican, and Pope Pius XII specifically, was largely silent during the Holocaust despite numerous pleas for help. I’ve heard it argued that there was only so much the Church could have publicly done, but I must disagree. Behind the scenes, Pius himself sheltered a small number of Jews and privately urged a few of his closest officials to do the same. But publicly, he remained neutral and refused to condemn the actions of Nazi Germany. He was more afraid of retaliation than doing what was right, despite the fact that the largely Catholic continent routinely looked to him for guidance. By outwardly staying silent it gave license to the general public to do the same. He allowed the assassins into the monastery.
A common thread throughout Grand Budapest is how it was truly the common man who maintained and tried to protect the precious culture and history that those in charge seemed more than willing to dismiss and destroy. When Gustav decides to secret “Boy with Apple” out of Madame D’s estate before anybody can stop him it is with the help of the staff, including Serge X and the maid Clotilde (Léa Seydoux), that the painting makes its way to the safe in the hotel (though it is Clotilde’s betrayal and Serge’s false testimony that lead Dmitri to Gustav — collaborators came from everywhere). To break Gustav and his new compatriots out of the comically large prison, it takes cooperation and coordination from everyone around him, including a fellow prisoner not in on the escape keeping quiet out of solidarity. The tools used are snuck in via Mendl’s fantastic baked goods, made with love by his assistant and Zero’s soon-to-be wife Agatha (Saoirse Ronan), and even the prison guards are too enamored with the craft and design to risk ruining the beauty to check for contraband. What’s more, the concierges across Europe are banded together in a secret society to ensure that nothing is lost that shouldn’t be.
So, too, did normal people carry the burden of protection of people and culture from the Nazis as their scourge spread across Europe. It wasn’t the bourgeois who hid Jews or assisted the allies in their attacks on German soldiers in France, but the everyday working class and those in bureaucratic positions with the power to do more than their jobs required. There are famous names among them, such as Oskar Schindler who spent a fortune protecting 1,100 Jews, and Raoul Wallenberg who risked his life (and lost it) smuggling over 7,000 more out of Europe, but many of the righteous were unknown and overlooked. These were people who had little to gain and so much to lose, and yet felt the need to act anyway. In addition to the lives that were saved, there are numerous artifacts, religious and secular, that only exist today because of the kindness regular men and women showed, great works of art that only survived due to their help.
Gustav H, in many ways, represents all of them in one. He is shown to be a solitary man content to live, alone, in the confines of a small closet nestled within the grand hotel’s chambers. He reads his men poetry during dinner every night, despite them paying little to no attention while they stuff their faces with delicious food (that he, himself, will not be eating). He values the painting not because of what it can make him financially (although he does recognize the practical nature of doing so before anyone can steal it back), but because of the beauty it contains — the painting will one day find its home behind his desk in the hotel and seemingly stay there until the establishment is demolished. He is also a man who wishes to comport with the elite (much like Schindler did), using his position to attend to the wealthy clientele (particularly the women), but he never truly becomes them even when the secret will names him to be the inheritor of the entire Grand Budapest Hotel, which Madam D is revealed to be the silent owner of prior to her death.
Of course, his most selfless act is his protection of Zero from certain death. Zero is a refugee from a different war-torn nation, a young man without a home or family to return to. It is clear from their encounter with the ZZ in the barley field that he is considered an undesirable, but Gustav refuses to allow anything to happen to the boy. He can say all he wants that it’s because he doesn’t want to replace such a perfect lobby boy, but we know he cares for those who need protection by his actions. Despite not having much to pass on himself, he makes Zero his sole heir — a gesture that Zero takes to heart and never forgets. The two become inseparable, and Gustav’s desire to shelter him will unfortunately lead to his demise. Near the end, the two are once again accosted on a train passing through the same barley field. The faux principles espoused during the First World War have since given way to true hatred and violence. There is no protecting Zero anymore, and Gustav is shot unceremoniously.
“We have lost some enthusiasm, it is true. We don’t go now in rose-colored spectacles to exhibitions, but we haven’t forgot when we did so.”
In June of 1830, a now-unknown author published the above in the essay “A Gossip About Art and Artists”, the earliest known example of any variation of the term “Rose Colored Glasses”. It harkens back to a time when many would where spectacles not to aid their vision, but to instead recolor the world around them in hues of pink and rose, to better hide blemishes and mistakes. A combination of two older turns of phrase, the 1700s use of the term “rosy” to denote cheerfulness and optimism, and the older still use of spectacles to represent one’s ability to discern the world around them. By bringing the two together, the author recognized that we once used rose-colored glasses to pretend we could see the world better with a different perspective, turning nightmares into beauty. The actual practice may be gone, but the irony in their writing indicates that the practice has become metaphorical.
For a director as keenly aware of his production design, the colors used in any Wes Anderson film cannot be viewed as accidental. Across his filmography, there is a pattern — darker and richer colors are readily prevalent, particularly browns, greens, and blues. There are always flashes of yellow and the occasional deep red, but rarely anything that one could deem “rosy”. The contrast he creates with harsh colors used to populate the measured and meticulous diorama of set design allows for an obvious subtext that beneath the layers of control and order there is a darkness and uncertainty that plagues all of us. The Grand Budapest begins with these same color palettes, the only notable red being the carpet strewn over the hotel lobby in 1968. But when we move backward to Gustav’s era, nearly every aspect of the hotel is pink, rosy, and lovely. Even the uniforms of the hotel staff are royal purple. The only spot that is not resplendent with the blushing hues is Gustav’s room, which is instead drab and light brown.
Anderson is telling a story, through the eyes of an old man, of a time long past and one that he views with great affection. The story, far more than any Wes has told before or since, is incredibly dark and violent. We are seeing a world attempting to hold on to its history and culture while the forces gaining ground are doing everything they can to strip it away, and because of the framing device (and our knowledge of actual history), we know that one day, it will. It’s no surprise that from Zero’s perspective, the time of his greatest adventure, fraught though it may be, is colored as rosy as the most beautiful flower he’s ever seen. Zero loves the hotel, he loves Gustav, and he loves what Zubrowka once was to a young, scared, orphaned boy searching for a new life and new home.
Zero also loves Agatha, though it is clear early on that she will be tragically lost before the Author makes his visit. When her image is first shown, Zero refuses to even discuss her further — it is too painful. When he, finally, begins to elaborate on their courtship it is with a grand smile and flowing tears that he does so. In his telling, the lights of Zubrowka revolve around her wonderful visage, a halo around a woman taken far too soon. We, the listeners, are like the Author wondering what tragedy would befall her — we even briefly believe that Jopling took her life, leading to an upsetting sense of relief when it is revealed his victim was instead Serge’s sister (why should we care any less about her?). In the end, her death is even more unceremonious than Gustav’s will be just one scene later. After the adventure is over Gustav presides over Zero and Agatha’s wedding, though instead of joy we get the matter-of-fact tale of how she died within two years.
“The Prussian grippe. An absurd little disease,” Zero tells us. “Today, we treat it in a single week; but in those days, many millions died.”
Recognizing the danger of looking at the past through rose-colored glasses is just as important as remembering the beauty that we lost. If Anderson was somehow making the argument that the world was a better place before the war, he undercuts it so brilliantly in moments just like this. We may be living in a time when so much of what made the world worth living in is gone, but it is also true that we don’t have to worry about disease in the same way — the things that killed millions without fail are now as survivable as a cold to most of us with the proper treatment and care (something we’ve seen since in compressed real-time with the COVID pandemic). Wars are still taking place across the globe, but many of us are privileged enough to live in places where that is not currently the case.
The question remains why Zero has chosen to maintain the hotel even in its dilapidated state, and why he chooses to return to a place that brings him so much pain regularly. The Author surmises that it must be his way of remembering the world his mentor, Gustav, cherished, one of class and culture. Zero, instead, dismisses this.
“You see, we shared a vocation, it wouldn’t have been necessary. No, the hotel I keep for Agatha. We were happy here, for a little while.” As for the world Gustav cherished, he continues, “To be frank, I think his world vanished long before he ever entered it. But I will say, he certainly sustained the illusion with marvelous grace.”
The Grand Budapest Hotel is a movie in a fictional place but in a real time, one when Europe wanted to pretend that, despite the devastation of The Great War, the era of prestige and bourgeois charm of the late 1800s was still intact and not, in fact, a dead man walking. People like Gustav H. lovingly acted as caretakers both in an attempt to restore this perceived greatness but also to remember it, in case it ever truly was lost. Gustav’s legacy is not the hotel he oversaw nor the wealthy women he consorted with, but the memories and ideas that he passed onto Zero. The same is true of us — we are the caretakers of the best of our time and our world. It is our responsibility to pass what we cherish onto future generations. But, it is vital that we do not forget the challenges and the problems that we collectively endured as well. Recalling our era with rose-colored glasses will only make it harder for the future to maintain what it has, what it cherishes. Only once we can enjoy the great things we have and learn from the mistakes surrounding them can we truly be the concierges to the next generation.

“Where are you guys from?”
The young man’s face was pockmarked with acne. His sandy blonde hair was swept back and held in place with a generous amount of some pungent product. On his chest, a bullet dangled from a long silver chain.
“Canada.”
“Oh, Canada? You know who I love who is from Canada? Musician. I give you a clue. He’s been famous since he was a little guy.”
“Um… Justin Bieber?”
The man scowled.
“No, man! Not Justin Bieber! Drake, man! Not Justin Bieber!”
Budapest is a long way from Canada, almost a quarter of the way around the world from our Vancouver home. But somehow, wherever we went in the Hungarian capital, Canada kept coming up.
It was a long ride. The highway roughly followed the path of the Danube, and we were grateful for the air conditioning. When we finally stepped out into the city’s central bus station, the heat hit us like a wall.
Budapest has been around forever, even if the city was only officially formed in the 19th century. Like all of this…

I arrived in Budapest and was greeted by hugs and tears — some were my own and others were from my wife as she waited expectantly at the airport for me. Rachel and I have spent the first four months of our married life in the season of advent, marked by daily FaceTime video chats. For us, advent ended on December 22nd in Budapest Airport. We moved into the season of Marriage Together, finally.
In my couple weeks in Budapest, much of our time has been spent walking up and down Fillér Utca, the street that takes us up and down the enormous hill that we live on. In between treks up this hill we’ve celebrated Christmas, grocery shopped, watched movies, made lefse, gotten our hair cut, marched for peace, and learned to re-light the water heater in our apartment.
We have attended services at Budavári Evangélikus Templom, a Lutheran Church that is about a 25 minute walk from our apartment. This church is located inside the castle district of Buda. The church is a little bit off of the beaten path, but Rachel tells me that’s not uncommon for Lutheran churches in this area of the world.
Services last about 1.5 hours each, with sermons going about 30–45 minutes. The services have been in Hungarian, so it is quite hard to follow; however, one of the first songs we sang at the Christmas Eve service was “A Mighty Fortress is Our God” or “Erős Vár a mi Istenünk.” This phrase is an important one to Lutherans in Hungary, and it is traditionally said when shaking hands with the pastor after the service. Also, we found it quite amusing in the Christmas Eve service when the pastor giving the sermon swiped his iPad and a Star Wars image spoof appeared projected above him.
At another service, Bishop Dr. Tamás Fabiny, of the Northern Diocese of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Hungary, helped preside and give the sermon. Bishop Fabiny has been a strong Lutheran voice in Hungary about the church’s responsibility to help refugees. Rachel and Bishop Fabiny have already begun to work together on ways to further integrate the YAGM program with the Lutheran Church in Hungary.
In my mind, one of the most adventuresome things to do when experiencing a new country and culture is to get your haircut. To me, there’s a real vulnerability in trusting another person to shape part of your physical appearance — especially when you’re not able to communicate to them fully what it is you want done. Rachel and I both took the plunge one evening, and it turned out to be a fun experience. Plus, I think that our stylist did a nice job!
On New Years Day we were invited to an ecumenical peace march by Bishop Fabiny. Together with faith leaders from the Roman Catholic Church, Coptic Church, Scottish Presbyterian, and Lutheran Church we marched about 10 blocks to a Catholic Church near the city center. At the church, there was a brief service for peace, where prayers were recited and candles were lit for each country that is experiencing war within its geographical boundaries.
It’s wonderful to finally be with Rachel in Budapest, and begin to live into our lives together. We are so thankful to all the people that have supported us in the months and years leading up to now. We look forward to crossing paths again with those that have helped us get to this point, and we look forward to the trails that lead to new friendships and experiences in the future.

I am Portuguese but have been living in Budapest for 1.5 years. Unfortunately, now I am temporarily back to Portugal because of the virus. But can’t wait to go back to my beloved adopted city. It is the coolest city in Europe!! I’m glad you got the chance to visit and I’m happy to see you liked it! Hopefully you can go back one day :)

Groundhopping in Budapest: MTK Budapest — Hidegkuti Nandor Stadion,https://medium.com/@kevinmccluskie01/groundhopping-in-budapest-mtk-budapest-hidegkuti-nandor-stadion-b6ba9c3a95c,"Sign up

In a change of pace, this Groundhop adventure took me back to the Hidegkuti Nandor Stadion for the first time since September 2019 when I took in an NBII match between MTK Budapest and Nyiregyhaza Spartacus; a game most memorable for then Nyiregyhaza goalkeeper Jova Levente scoring from the penalty spot.
My return to the Hidegkuti Nandor Stadion after a two-year hiatus was not, however, to see MTK Budapest but instead to watch the Hungary v Scotland Women’s World Cup Qualifier.
Hidegkuti Nandor is a legend of the Hungarian game and famed member of the Arany Csapat who played for MTK Budapest, in their numerous guises, between 1946 and 1958. Hidegkuti is best known for his starring role in Hungary’s famous 6–3 victory over England at Wembley Stadium, where he scored a hat-trick; the game is immortalised in mural on Rumback Sebestyn U. in Budapest’s Jewish Quarter.
Hidegkuti was a talent ahead of his time helping to pioneer the deep lying forward role — a role that the likes of Denis Bergkamp would later find much success in — with his innovative and creative play helping him to over 260 career goals along with countless assists for his team-mates at both club and national level.
Upon his death in 2012 MTK Hungaria, as MTK were then known, renamed their stadium in honour of the club hero and when the original stadium was torn down and rebuilt in 2016 the new stadium maintained the name of Hidegkuti Nandor.
The stadium has a capacity of just over 5,300, however, it has one weird peculiarity about it — behind both goals are large concrete walls giving the stadium the air of a prison yard at times.
If truth be told, I had no idea that this game was even taking place until around midday on the day of the game when a message from a friend in New Zealand alerted me to the fixture. Despite the short notice, the evening’s plans were quickly changed to take in the rare occasion of a Scotland match.
For this one I would be joined by my wife — whose native Hungarian language skills would come in extremely handy — and our young daughter; I was on my best behaviour.
By error, which later turned out to be quite fortuitous, we arrived at the stadium about an hour and a half before kick-off; I hadn’t put two and two together that the kick-off time on the BBC Alba advert I’d been sent was the UK time and not the Budapest kick-off time. Sometimes I wonder about myself.
Arriving at the stadium to buy our tickets we noticed that the Penztar offices were shut. Step up my wife who found out from the security guards that we had to register and buy tickets on the MLSZ website. For those unaware, selecting your seats and purchasing tickets on the MLSZ website via mobile is possibly the most frustrating experience known to man.
After approximately 45 minutes of seats being added to the basket, dropping out the basket, and being re-added to the basket, we were finally able to purchase and download our matchday tickets for the reasonable price of 1,000 HUF each — circa £3.
Perhaps the takeaway lessons here are to make sure of the kick-off time and way to purchase tickets in advance of rocking up at the stadium.
Once in inside and pre-match refreshments purchased we made our way to our seats, my daughter enthralled by the floodlights and sight of girls out on the pitch where ‘men normally play’, and talking incessantly about everything she saw. It was great.
Anthem Time — The Hidegkuti Nandor fell silent for the National anthems. As Flower of Scotland echoed out over the tannoy system a lone Scottish voice, in amongst the couple of thousand Hungarians in attendance, began to belt out the Anthem with as much pride and gusto as he could manage; his daughter telling him with mild panic “Daddy, everyone’s looking at us”.
Yes, dear reader, that lone Scottish voice was mine.
From the off Scotland were dominant and maintained the upper hand for the majority of the game, the first in charge for new manager Pedro Martinez Losa.
After a bright opening, the breakthrough came in the 17th minute through Erin Cuthbert who scored from the rebound of her own missed penalty.
As the first half wore on complacency and slack passing crept into the Scottish game and Hungary began to grow in confidence but without really threatening Lee Alexander in the Scotland goal.
The second half picked up where the first ended with Scotland still the better side but prone to being their own worst enemy with some poor decision making at vital times giving Hungary hope of a way back into the game.
That all changed with the introductions of Lana Clelland and Martha Thomas just after the hour. The subs made an immediate impact with Clelland going close on a couple of occasions and causing the home defence problems before Thomas headed in a second for Scotland with a quarter of an hour to go.
Thomas’ goal effectively killed the game as a contest and, try as they did, Hungary failed to carve open the Scotland backline and find a route back into the game. In fact, it was Scotland who could and should have scored again with Claire Emslie missing a guilt edged chance towards the end.
It’s traditional in Hungary that the home side applaud the fans for coming out to see them, and at International level the men’s team are often serenaded by the Ultras giving a rousing post-match rendition of Himnusz, the Hungarian national anthem.
On Friday night, not only did the home players applaud the fans, but several of the Scotland team also came over to show appreciation of the (ahem) vocal minority of Scots in attendance. A small act that was greatly appreciated, especially by my daughter who had been blown away by the action on the pitch and the fact Scotland won, and hasn’t stopped about talking about the two players who ‘asked her’ for a picture; Lisa Robertson and Eartha Cummings, that small gesture meant the world to her (and me, if I’m being honest).
Next up for Scotland is a home game against the Faroe Islands on Tuesday — I’ll try to get the right kick-off time so I can tune in — and for Hungary, they host Spain, also on Tuesday and at the Hidegkuti Nandor Stadion.

I had done a fair amount of research on Budapest before I landed there, unlike my other random trip. This was a 13day long trip to East Europe and I had done all my bookings, research well in advance. I also got lucky with Budapest because a friends friend had lived there for three years and was immensely helpful in guiding me about the place and telling me about things I cannot miss in Budapest.
I have five days in Budapest and had fair amount of time to hand to cover all the things this friend had mentioned about in leisure. And trust me it wasn’t a point A to Point B, cover all the tourist points kind of a plan. She and I had common interests and she guided me on things that I would enjoy the most. Old and rustic pubs with live music for instance, a spa is always what I love to indulge in, you could call it a festish if you like.
There are so many experiences from Budapest that I would like to share about but what always stands out for me is something that changes something inside me. It could be anything from a conversation with a fellow traveller to an authentic meal. In Budapest it had to be the thermal bath experience.
I was told there are natural thermal baths and spas across the city and one can literally spend the day in one of those. Based on my friends recommendation, I decided to go to the one of the most popular one. While this is an experience I was waiting for, there was a lot running in my mind. I had asked none of them to my friend and the internet gave adequate information but for some reason I wasn’t trusting everything. As Indian’s we are not so familiar with public bath’s unless you are taking a dip in the holy rivers with all your clothes on. I had things running in my head and what did I have to shed to enjoy the experience fully?
Fortunately or unfortunately for me I just had to shed my inhibitions and walk into this beautiful place equipped with my swim suit. I got to Szechenyi Baths around three in the afternoon, it was fairly crowded and there was a small queue in front of the ticket counter and I was fourth or fifth in line, waiting to get my ticket and brimming with anticipation. When I got to the counter there was a man behind the counter and I asked if I could get a ticket for couple of hours, he answered politely and said the passes are for full day and I could use any of the baths I like. Now that is again something I discovered, I assumed there was only one large thermal bath. And I had not carried my own towel or flip flops so I could rent them at the counter as well and they would return the money on your way out when you return the towel and flip flop back.
Then I walked down to a narrow corridor after my tickets was punched to the women’s changing room and to get myself a locker. The fear of being nude in a public place is something I was not sure of and I was grateful that I could be in my swim suit. I mostly saw couples coming together or families or group of friends, I do not remember seeing another single traveller looking around lost and thrilled as I was.
As I made my way up to the baths finally I was freezing in my swimsuit, the temperature must have been around 8 degrees or lesser but the breeze was cold. In from of me were these three huge bath areas where filled with people, I could hardly wait to jump in, there were lockers by the pool side for people to keep their valuables and phones. I could not miss taking a few selfies and then locked my phone safely and left the towel at one of the chairs and walked right into the water. Oh man, so warm and relaxing, it was a bit too crowded for my liking by I found my spot and just chilled there soaking in the water for sometime before looking around and figuring what next. then I saw a fun whirlpool in the middle. I saw groups of people losing control and getting dragged into the whirlpool and having a lot of fun but again my minds talk started to converse. Everyone you see there are either couples or families or groups of friends having a blast, what would you to there alone. I though for a couple of minutes, wished I had my friends along but jumped right in. Let nothing stop you from living your life to the fullest a voice said inside me, I assumed it to be my mum.
Then it was time to experience the other pools and check the temperature difference and just experience everything that there was to experience. There was close to 12 smaller pools, which were indoor, less crowded and each one had different temperature and were in different sizes. Though I must admit that the vibe outdoors was way better. I believe there are all nigh parties that happens in these baths but I am not an all night party person at all, so that idea was not too exciting for me.
I had spent over three hours jumping from one pool to the other and now was starting to feel a bit tired and hungry. So, I bid farewell to the water and got straight into the shower and changing room. I would highly recommend the thermal baths in Budapest. But do not go there in a rush go post lunch and spend at least 3 hours. I would surely travel back to Budapest and dip in the water shedding a few more inhibitions and doubts of the mind. But till then the memories stays alive within.
Tips:
Highly recommend the full day pass at Szechenyi Thermal bath.
The ticket cost is about 22 Euros.
Carry you own towel and flip flops.
Spend 3 to 4 hours at least.

In this exercise I will try to recommend players for MTK Budapest. To suggest specific players we have to create player profiles. These profiles are important because every football club (like regular businesses) wants to maximize their return on investment. In sports, return is not only measured financially. Sporting results are usually higher in the hierarchy of the football clubs’ goals. To create player profiles we must know the tasks that the players are instructed to do. The closer the specific player’s profile is to the desired profile (usually called fit), the better the system works. These instructions are based on the coaching philosophy. Coaching philosophy obviously should be clear for every decision maker at the club. Coaching philosophy and club philosophy should also match, because both parties work for the same goal. Another important aspect is club identity and tradition, which is based on club history, club community and other environmental factors. If these 3 factors are synchronized (coaching philosophy, club philosophy, club identity and tradition) then it is easy to document tasks and therefore create player profiles. After this non-club specific entry let’s get into it.
MTK Budapest is undeniably one of the most important clubs (not only football) in Hungary. They won the second most (23x) Hungarian championships, which is quite impressive. But their effect on Hungarian football is even more impressive than that. To shorten your reading experience I will list some of the most important words that come to my mind about MTK Budapest. Tradition, culture, openness, innovation, talent management, intellectuality, community. These values could be easily seen on the pitch. MTK’s traditional football is arguably the blueprint for modern teams. High possession, lots of short passes, patience and near perfect organization. This should be the starting point of every decision at the club.
The club has one of the best youth system installed in Hungary. They founded the first football academy in Hungary in 2001. It is a key point in MTK’s current strategy to promote youth players to the first team, therefore it is crucial to have succession planning in mind when we try to recruit players. Pathways for talented individuals to the first team should be clear. Although my recruitment model is able to value relevant youth players (U16 and older), for this exercise I am not gonna use it. Upon request I can value the youth players of MTK and set up 3–5 year succession planning.
Dávid Horváth is one of the most talented coaches in Hungarian football. It is rare that a 38-year old coach is given trust in the first division. Firstly let’s see how he describes his own philosophy:
“We want to dominate in ball possession, create big chances, we don’t want to win with only 1 goal scored in the long term.”
“ I’m trying to make my own way. I don’t want to name anyone, from every great coach I try to take those elements that I like. Our coaching courses have followed a lot of directions, that is undeniable, when I studied the German style was emphasized, which is great If take a look on world football, German managers dominate, actually Jürgen Klopp and Thomas Tuchel were the coaches in the FA cup final. But I look up to the Italian coaches as well, Carlo Ancelotti doing fantastic things leading Real Madrid. I read a lot, I try to follow the international trends. At the same time when I got here, I took a deep dive in the club history, I try to follow the traditions laid by Jimmy Hogan and Márton Bukovi. I know for a fact that the legendary manager, József Garami followed the Dutch school.”
“The high intensity football that we showed in the last 4 rounds…is my ideal football. I think with this we can follow the world trends.”
index.hu
“The kind of playing style I try to instill is dependent on the club I work for. MTK has the identity, the club philosophy, even the playing style, here you have to be an MTK-style coach, and that football is — high possession, modern game, creating quantitative and qualitative superiority mixed with enough flexibility — is close to my heart, It is not hard to adapt.”
bunteto.com
Let’see how Dávid Horváth performed and whether he could show his philosophy. He managed 26 games in NB2 in the 2022/23 season. A traditional way too evaluate managerial performance is to use the point per match metric. It is certainly a good starting point, but this metric does not account for two important aspects. Home field advantage and opponent strength. Luckily my model include both of these elements providing a clearer picture than the traditional PPM. Here is the output document.
Although he had great resources, he did not disappoint results wise. It is clear that it was a good decision to appoint him as a manager. Stylistically he followed the club identity and traditions. Low number of crosses in chance creation is pleasing to see if you are a decision maker at MTK.
The defensive side is not as steady as the offensive, but still good for a 86 score out of 100. Probably a bit more aggressive approach would benefit MTK Budapest as they let the opponent keep the ball for longer periods. This coaching profile is another great addition to the tradition and club philosophy to create player profiles. Now we know what we are looking for.
I’m not going to analyze every player one by one, because this piece would be waaaay too long. I don’t really know, which formation will be the primary option. Some say 3–5–2 will be the one, but I would go with the 3–4–3. Maximizing the potential of Mátyás Kovács should be a primary goal for this season. In my opinion 3–5–2 does not suit him. The depth chart is based on a 3–4–3, because I think they will change to that soon. But these are just numbers and there is more depth to formations than this format.
Obviously there is much more nuance to rating players then grouping them into 3 categories, but it gives us a starting point. It is very important to note that I categorized players based on how I imagine their role in a team in the 4th — 6th range, which is not an unrealistic expectation based on wage expenses.
Sorted positions are: GK, central CB, LCB, LWB, CM, LW, CF
Positions that may need upgrading: RCB, RWB, RW
In this position MTK Budapest has the numbers, but I’m not sure there is enough quality. Kaka Godwords has a lot to improve to even reach NB2 level. Bence Várkonyi had a loan spell last season, he played for Kozármisleny FC in the spring. He is an aggressive defender, who performs well in defensive duels and has the recovery pace to cover large areas. When Várkonyi played, the defense of Kozármisleny was much better. For me the problems are on the ball with him. He is not a great passer. He rarely attempts progressive or forward passes and does not really asks for the ball, which is weird for an MTK Budapest alumni. He is still a good player, but did not pop off the screen. That is why I consider him as a quality rotation option in NB1 or a good starter in NB2.
I thought about moving Gergő Kocsis into the starter quality, so he is definitely on the fringes for me. He had a great season in NB2, he is very good on the ball, aggressive in duels (bit too much) and a versatile player. The only “problem” I have with him, is that Kocsis is 29 years old and only once in his professional career edged the 50% mark. What does the 50% mark mean? It means that the player played in 50% or more of the available minutes. It is a good measure to decide who is a starter and who’s not. That is why I grouped him as a quality rotation piece.
Benedek Varju is another player, where I was unsure where to place him. He is 22 years old, but has over 100 matches for MTK Budapest. For me he is best suited to play in the RCB position in a 3-man defense. Last season he played the most minutes at the right-back position. He was aggressive and performed well in defensive duels. He is great in the air, compared to other fullbacks. He is good in build-up play, takes good care of the ball. His progressive play and chance creation is also great, but well below the elite level. The reason why I’m not sure he is a clear starter is that he is often caught out of position, he definitely has to improve this part of his game. According to transfermarkt his contract will expire in 2024, although I expect MTK to extend his contract (I would probably do it, too).
Viktor Gey like Varju, is also a player who can play as a full-back/wing-back and centre-back. He is a new arrival from Kisvárda. He reached 2000+ minutes in NB1 the last 3 seasons, but his impact score is only 10 out of 100 in my model, rating him well below league average. It is hard to project future impact, it is even more difficult when a player changes teams. But I would have gone with a different choice.
We’ve covered the current options, now it is time to describe what we need.
I think these characteristics are important to be a great RCB in Dávid Horváth’s system.
Felix Bacher is a versatile, 22-year old Austrian centre-back. He is comfortable in a 3-man defense, and in a 4-man defense too. Can be deployed as a central CB, a right-sided CB or as right-back. He has a good frame, fast enough, no problem with physical capabilities. Extremely comfortable with the ball. Teammates trust him. Progressive passes and progressive runs are both part of his game. He has to adopt his style to MTK. Pass selection must tilt towards safety a bit more. Although Bacher is 1,9 m tall, he is below average in the air, which is an issue. All in all, I rate Bacher very highly. He was part of the Austrian Bundesliga Team of The Year, which is very impressive from a 9th placed WSG Tirol team. He is definitely good enough to play for MTK Budapest and this is probably the last time, when he can be attainable.
Another interesting name is Saba Khvadagiani. He is 20 years old and plays for Dinamo Tbilisi. He is well suited to play in a 3-man defense. He is very aggressive, he likes to “chase” his man and step out of the defensive line frequently. He has the speed and agility to play in a high line. Khvadagiani is a ball-playing centre-back, an elite ball progressor using both carries and passes. He is used to high possession and highly efficient in build-up play. He already debuted in the Georgian National Team and his reputation is growing by the day. He is a Georgian champion, and has experience in European Qualifiers as well. I would highly recommend him for MTK Budapest.
I think both of these players would significantly raise the talent level at MTK and have high resale value potential in them.
We’ve already covered the two main options Viktor Gey and Varju Benedek I don’t think they are the best options to be starting wing-backs. Ádám Miknyóczki played wing-back last season, but he is definitely a winger. This position is surely one I would upgrade.
Some of the needed characteristics are obviously same as for the centre-backs, but there are some post-specific requirements too.
The first name is Erik Kusnyír, whose contract expires in the summer of 2024, according to transfermarkt.com. He is one of my favorite players in the Hungarian NB1. I expect him to debut in the Hungarian National Team soon.
Kusnyír would be a fantastic addition for MTK, he fits the profile needed and possess high quality. I would highly recommend him.
Another player, who could be an option is Dan Sirbu of FCV Farul Constanta. He was a regular player of the Romanian champions. Sirbu is a versatile player, who can play as a RB, RWB, DM and CB also.
Sirbu is definitely a more attacking-minded player, than Kusnyír. I don’t know if the Romanian could be an affordable option for MTK, I guess it depends on the contract situation. Personally I would pick Kusnyír, because he fits the profile better, and for now a better player.
This position has the depth, but may need 1 quality signing. As I mentioned this is Ádám Miknyóczky’s main position, but he could not establish himself in NB2, unlikely to see him succeed in NB1. A loan would be the best option for him personally. I thought Nikolas Spalek will be a bigger boom in NB2, but he barely edged the 200 minutes mark. Most likely to start is Zoltán Stieber. Stieber delivered great numbers, but my model did not like him in NB2, which is unlikely to change one division higher. He is still a very good offensive player, but his defensive contribution is not enough for this level. There is a player, who haven’t played a lot at RW last season, whom I would certainly try to instill into the team. His name is Ákos Zuigeber. The well-rounded attacker always had great potential (still do), but injuries slowed down his development. Last season he mostly played as a LW, but he can play across the front line.
My first option would be to move him to the right side. But if MTK wants to solve this problem with another choice, here is what I would do.
I expect the wing-backs to provide width → Inside forward type, attacks the box, scores goals
Patient build-up → Can create against set defenses
High-possession style → Has the opportunities to try and create, has self-confidence to express himself
Creation not reliant on crosses → Creative both as a passer and receiver
One player, who fits this profile is Balázs Vogyicska. NB1 teams should have been all over him considering his age and talent.
Vogyicska is the player of Ferencvárosi TC. I don’t think he will play for them this season. It would be a shame if he is loaned to Soroksár SC in NB2. I would definitely recommend him for MTK Budapest.
I think both Zuigeber and Vogyicska would be a very good option for MTK.
Let’s see how MTK Budapest looks after our attempt to strengthen the side.
This side has the defensive quality to achieve the expectations. My model estimates that there are only 2 players out of this 11, who has a negative impact on the defensive side.
The offensive quality is probably even more starring. With the same of players (2) who are below average on offense per my model. We have players, who are comfortable on the ball. Mátyás Kovács and Ákos Zuigeber are interchangable in the half spaces. Every player fits well in the system.
In my opinion we strengthened the squad of MTK Budapest significantly at least in theory. This team would be good enough to contend for European places in NB1. Most of the players have significant value and could enter the market after a successful season, which fits well into the philosophy of MTK.
In this exercise I used transfermarkt and wyscout data. To value the coach and players I used my own holistic model, which accounts for quality of teammates and strength of opponents. If you have any questions or suggestions or just want to talk about football please let me know.

I have stood on many parts of the banks of this great river and looked down the Danube. But none stays with me like this moment in Budapest.
We had finished our visit to Buda Castle and stopped for dinner by sunset on the banks of the Danube. We were beginning our walk back home because we wanted to cross the Danube under the stars. It did not disappoint us.
The Chain Bridge is beautiful at twilight. From the moment the sun transitions from harsh brightness to golden yellow, the Chain Bridge passes through many seasons. Each is different and lingers, even if it lasts only a few minutes.
But all this fades away before the night. As the lights go out one by one, the Chain Bridge is transformed into a magnificent apparition over the water. It sits like a tiara above the Danube.
It does not surprise me to remember that when it was inaugurated in 1848, it was hailed as a work of engineering and among the largest such bridges in the world. Today, the world may have raised other more complex structures, but anyone who walks…

I was following our tour guide through Budapest’s Liberty Square when he stopped the group and pointed to a larger-than-life bronze statue. “Do you know who this is?”
We shuffled closer, and I gasped. “Ronald Reagan? You have a statue of Ronald Reagan in your capitol?”
My next question echoed what many of us were thinking. “Why?”
The tour guide beamed. “Hungarians believe Ronald Reagan had a lot to do with the fall of Communism in our country. His famous words, ‘Take down that wall,’ started the whole thing rolling.”
The guide continued, “There are many who believe his economic policies led to the downfall of the Soviet Union. The people wanted to show their appreciation for your former president’s efforts in ending the Cold War.”
As I spent more time in Budapest, I noticed a recurring theme. The Hungarians felt oppressed and stripped of their rights when the Soviet Union controlled their country, and feelings…

I was quite worried about coming back to The Grand Budapest Hotel. I watched it in late 2014, around the time of its release, when I was first starting to take cinema more seriously. At the time, it completely alienated me. That being said, I would’ve been 12 then… not exactly in Anderson’s target (or even considered) audience.
I returned to the film in 2020, when I had to watch it for one of my first year classes at university. I… still didn’t like it, but at least it made me laugh a few times in the process.
Considering that I have, up to this point, enjoyed every Anderson film to a certain extent, I was curious to see if my opinion on The Grand Budapest Hotel might finally change, making a radical, gradual shift across nine years from frustration to love.
My opinion did not change, though.

I love Hungary. Budapest was my favorite city ever when I visited it in 2022, and the food, the people, everything was fantastic. Although I understand some of what Viktor Orban believes, I can't fathom why he is blocking Sweden from joining NATO.

I stepped forward and found myself surrounded by several men. Their faces were serious and their eyes were watching me with unshielded curiosity.
I generally thought my family was somehow odd. Every year, as a general rule, we left on a few most colorful getaways, abandoning the commonplace everyday practice of our regular routines. It wasn’t so much that we were rich or had some mysterious fortune buried; we just had a talent for tracking down the most dark and exciting objections. Yet, it was only after we visited Budapest that I started to think something was wrong.
The city was a mix of old-world appeal and dynamic innovation, its roads overflowing with history and culture. We showed up at our leased condo, a curious little spot settled among the cobblestone roads of Buda, ignoring the glory of the Danube Waterway. It was the ideal setting for one more of our yearly experiences.
The night after our appearance, I chose to investigate the city all alone, drawn by the persona of Budapest’s complex roads. As I wandered through the architecturally significant area of the Palace Slope, I coincidentally found a little bookshop. Charmed, I pushed open the creaky entryway and wound up encompassed by racks loaded up with dusty old books, maps, and blurred photos.
An old man standing behind the overloaded counter was looking at me through the thick lenses of his glasses. He appeared to be pretty much as old as the books he protected. “Searching for something particularly amazing, youthful one?” he scratched.
“Simply perusing”, I answered. “But, I’d be intrigued assuming you have some books about Budapest’s secret history.”
His eyes shimmered with a disrupting glimmer. “Oh, unlike the others. Most vacationers come here for knickknacks and keepsakes, however, you look for a real thing.”
I raised an eyebrow, inquisitive. “A real thing?”
The old man inclined nearer, his voice scarcely above a murmur. “Budapest holds privileged insights, my boy. Privileged insights that a few families have protected for ages.”
My heart animated as I paid attention to the elderly person’s secretive words. “What sort of mysteries?”
He looked around to make sure no other person was tuning in before proceeding, “Professional assassins, my dear. This city has been home to an old and mysterious guild of professional assassins for quite a long time.”
I was unable to accept what I was hearing. It must be a fanciful story turned by a whimsical elderly person. “Professional assassins? Here in Budapest? That is absurd.”
He reached under the counter and gave me a well-used calfskin-bound book. Its pages were yellowed with age, and its title was just “The Budapest Guild.” I flipped through the pages, my suspicion winding down with each word. I was so confused by the story that I didn’t realize that the book was written in Hungarian. And that I was reading it with no problem.
The book spoke about the Budapest Guild, whose roots extend back to the Middle Ages.
As per the book, individuals from the guild worked in the shadows, executing clandestine missions for strong and cryptic clients. They were experts in camouflage, penetration, and trickiness, leaving no hint of their presence. In any case, the most stunning disclosure was on the way — the organization was reputed to be comprised of select, honorable families who passed down their knowledge and skills from one generation to the next.
I got back to our condo, my psyche hustling about the Budapest Guild. I couldn’t resist the opportunity to contemplate whether my family was in some way or another associated with it. Their often getaways to intriguing areas unexpectedly took on a vile contort.
That evening, as we plunked down to supper sitting above the city’s gleaming lights, I wanted to concentrate on my family with freshly discovered doubt. Their chuckling appeared to be all in all too practiced, their discussions excessively enigmatic. Might it be said that they were simply unpredictable voyagers, or was there more to them than met the eye?
As I dove further into the privileged insights of Budapest, I understood that my mission for reality could uncover beyond anything I expected. I was going to find that some family getaways were destructive businesses and that the Budapest Guild’s shadowy association had ringlets that came farther than I at any point envisioned.
Amid the charming roads of Budapest, my journey for truth was slowly unfolding secret and interest. The finding of the Budapest Guild had shaken my entire life, and with days passing, I was getting more hungry to reveal the whole story. And my role in it. Luckily, the antiquated book was helpful in my quest. Its yellowed pages helped me to uncover the Guild’s main seat.
So one night, while my family ate in our leased loft, I got away to investigate the city’s privileged insights all alone. The moon hung low in the night sky, creating long shaded areas on the cobblestone roads of Buda. It was during these nighttime hours that Budapest uncovered its most profound secrets.
I meandered through the complex back streets of Palace Slope, my expectations becoming stronger with every step I took. As I wandered further into the evening, I coincidentally found a faintly lit back street that coaxed me forward.
It was in this dark back street that I experienced a gathering of shadowy figures, their countenances clouded by the shroud of haziness. My heart hustled as I understood they were talking in quiet tones, their words a melodic rhythm of the Hungarian language. I stood frozen, concealed in the shadows, and tuned in.
Suddenly, one voice transcended the others — a voice I knew quite well. It was my dad’s, his tone firm and commanding. He ordered me to come closer and join the group.
“Your opportunity has arrived,” he said. His words rang with seriousness. “It’s your time to become familiar with our inheritance.”
I stepped forward and found myself surrounded by several men. Their faces were serious and their eyes were watching me with unshielded curiosity.
“Welcome to the Guild young man”, one of them said. Later, I learned that he was the Grand Master of the Guild and Master of the school I was about to join.
My father came over, gave me a quick hug, and said: “Make our family proud.” After that, he turned and walked down the street. I watched him until he disappeared into the dark shadows.
Then I turned to my new teachers. They simply turned and stepped toward the dead end of the street. They stopped briefly, just long enough to open a door that had not been seen until then. I stepped through them without hesitation, into my new life.

What up, it’s ya boy Yung Wes Anderson back again with another blog post. I know I’m a bit late, it’s been hard synthesizing everything that went down in Budapest. Luckily, there’s a thunderstorm raging outside my window, so I’ve finally got some time to piece together my past week in what’s been my favorite city so far.
Budapest is a gorgeous, walk-able city that reminded me a lot of San Francisco without the expensive price tag. The city is actually a combination of two : Buda and Pest, divided by the Danube river that runs through the middle. A recent influx in tourism is causing a massive spike in development and, contrary to Prague, Budapest felt geared to host tourists. There’s an extensive hostel network that’s deeply intertwined with the city and its offerings, allowing you to purchase tickets for many of the main attractions at the reception desk of wherever you’re staying. Stories of people extending their stay multiple times were commonplace. I was definitely tempted.
I arrived in the afternoon with Kiah, the Australian traveler I met in Vienna. We had booked the same hostel, Sziget City (named after Budapest’s annual musical festival), for its cheap price and non-party hostel status. I was still getting over the traveler’s cold I picked up in Prague and needed a quiet place to recover while I coughed and sneezed my way through a box of tissue paper. I was naive to critique Prague’s party scene before seeing Budapest’s, which took the concept to the next level.
Sziget City is an old, re-purposed apartment complex with a quiet courtyard overshadowed by a large cherry tree. It’s also five doors down from Retox, the nexus of a six hostel network where massive drinking events like the Jager Train (300 shots of Jagermeister being made simultaneously) or the AlchOlymips (six intense drinking “sports”) take place nightly. Sziget City provided the best of both worlds, allowing me to tap into either atmosphere whenever if I felt like it.
I’d make my social debut the following night at Retox for karaoke night, but not for too long. I stared in disbelief with a guy from New York as people made out on the dance floor to an awful rendition of the Backstreet Boy’s “I Want It That Way”. We talked a bit about the global pervasiveness of Western pop culture, which would follow me everywhere I went throughout the week. My bus driver was playing Leona Lewis. The vegetarian burger stand was blasting Arctic Monkeys. The sandwich shop was playing Kamaiyah (ayyy).
I slowly eased myself into being more active. And by eased, I mean the opposite. I went out dancing the following evening. The DJ was spinning absolute bangers from Missy Elliot to Migos. I found a dance partner from D.C. who was studying abroad in Berlin and vacationing in Budapest. We danced until we were drenched in sweat, exchanged contact info, and called it a night.
The next day I went with Kiah to the Szechenyi Spa house, deep in the Pest side of the city. Budapest has a natural geothermal network running beneath it, so you’ll find hot-springs scattered throughout the city. Szechenyi is one of the largest in Europe, a dandelion rectangle enclosing three turquoise pools. I felt like I was in a Wes Anderson film, except the grandiose locations he portrays are usually long past their heyday with a few stragglers desperately, nostalgically grasping for the past. Szechenyi is very much in its prime. Like animals at a waterhole, humans waded around, some on the backs of others, sitting on the steps, beneath the fountain head, eyes closed, breathing deeply. We explored the interior after lounging in and out of the pools outside. More spas, more saunas of different shapes, depths, and temperatures. We concluded our stay at the bath house with an hour-long Thai massage that opened up my shoulders and legs and left me sore for the next two days.
Later that evening I attended one of the famous boat parties along the river between Buda and Pest. All of the main government buildings were illuminated on the river bank and their reflections danced on the river’s surface (see cover photo above). I met up with Grace, my dance partner from the night before, and we chatted about growing up mixed and our family dynamics (she had 14 au pairs growing up). She introduced me to two of her friends who were staying at my hostel, Marco and Isabelle. They had all met at NYU and their travels and holidays happened to coincide. It was an all-you-can-drink event so people were going to town on the booze, but alcohol is so cheap out here that there’s no way anyone could beat the bar and live to tell the tale. I did a decent job pacing myself, but when the ferry abruptly docked, I took two more cups of wine for the road and put myself into solidly drunken territory. We all had separately rough endings to our night.
The next morning, I went on a free walking tour (which I highly recommend to anyone exploring a new city) with Damon, a new roommate with a great attitude from New Zealand. I met up with Grace and her friends from NYU and we slowly made our way around town. We saw St. Stephens Cathedral, based off the first christian king of Hungary. They have his 500 year old hand inside and they follow it around during one of the hottest days of the year, annually. We crossed the river to the Buda side and checked out the government palaces before ending up in front of another yet another old church with yet another stunning view that overlooked all of Pest.
The NYU students and I stopped by a small, 200 year old coffee shop before making our way across the river for dinner. We went to an open mic night hosted by the hostels and Isabelle and Marco did a live rendition of some Kanye lyrics in spoken word fashion. We hung out upstairs afterwards and debated the ethics of music consumption before heading towards Szimpla, a collection of bars and dance floors that inhabit the ruins of an old, abandoned building. We found ourselves sharing shisha amidst the street art, graffiti, and re-purposed sculptures. We danced to Central American music until 3 in the morning before parting ways with Grace, who’d be returning to Berlin that morning.
I said my goodbyes to Kiah the next afternoon before checking out the House of Terror with Damon. What was once a KGB/Nazi torture facility has now been transformed into an exhibition/memorial about soviet and Nazi activity in Hungary before, during, and after World War II. The exhibition started at the top floor and slowly made its way to the torture dungeons in the cellar. A large tank sat on a platform in the center of the atrium, semi-submerged in six inches of still, black water, with just a razor’s-width of liquid seeping ominously down the sides. No photos allowed :(
I met up with Marco and Isabelle in the evening, tried some local cuisine, and explored a few of the ruins bars again. On the way out, a college-aged woman was cursing out a tall, gruff Hungarian man for catcalling one of her friends. She and her friends were clearly drunk and the guy threatened to hit her if she kept saying “fuck you” to his face. We intervened and created some distance between the two groups, but the man suddenly sprinted down the street and slapped the girl hard on the side of her face from behind. The girl ran off crying with her friends. He started walking after us, telling me to turn around and face him, saying I’d be a bitch if I didn’t, and finally backing away in the opposite direction after it was clear we weren’t going to engage with him.
We walked the group back to their hostel while the woman who had been assaulted sobbed about how men are horrible (true), how she wants to go back home to Florida (fair), how she’s a nice girl who volunteers and doesn’t deserve this (uh, ok), how she didn’t want anyone to touch her (despite the fact that she and her friend were both very drunk and crossing the busiest street in Budapest at a red light. I had to physically move them in order to dodge oncoming traffic like a game of Frogger). One of her friends kept insisting on going back to fight the guy, leaving the group, and requiring us to run after her. Another was hitting on Marco as her friend cried nearby. We had a lot of mixed emotions about the whole ordeal, and were equal parts relieved and exhausted by the time we got them home.
I spent my last day in Budapest saying farewell to all of the amazing people I’d met throughout the week. I took one last stroll through the city with Isabelle before throwing my backpack on and departing. It was the most raw and bittersweet I’ve felt so far. In just six short days, I’d shared so many conversations with guests and hostel staff in the courtyard that they started to feel like family. Budapest’s street had become so familiar to me I could walk them without a map. I can see how people end up here indefinitely. But it was getting colder, which meant it was time for me to get going, I’m running south from the winter every few days like some god damn Game of Thrones character.
I’m in Croatia now. A guard with a silver pistol checked my passport at the border and was crazy enough to let me in. I’m entering week four of my travels and feeling more adjusted, though there are still days where I wake up and forget which country I’m in. I’m happy I have five more months ahead of me. The sadness I feel leaving new friends in a new city will soon be replaced by the happiness of meeting new friends in a new city, but the process is emotionally exhausting. I guess that just comes with the territory.
Well! You’ve made it to the end, thanks for reading. I hope it was worth your time. Stay tuned for some saucy shots from the Balkans next week!

It’s 10:26 a.m and I am in the outside of a McDonald’s in the middle of Budapest stealing Wi-Fi. My fingers are cold, I over-spent the money I had for the trip, and I am very tired. Gabriel and I booked the wrong tickets to get back to Mostar, so we came here to try and reserve a quicker way to get back home. If we can call our student residences “home”, of course.
The word “home” has interesting connotations. While it can be somewhat accurately described as a succession of four letters used to describe a place where you go to sleep every day, it is not exactly that. Home is the place where you come back to, no matter where you are. It is the Rome of our lives: the place where all our roads end up.
However, Rome also fell. At some point, it was more meaningful for all roads to go through Constantinople than through Rome. At some point, it was more useful for the center of the world to be in England than in Constantinople. And, at some point, it is better for home to disappear.
As I stop writing this article to look at the door of the McDonald’s to see if any employee is coming to get us away, I look at my luggage: a small carry-on with a questionable sense of blue-and-grey fashion. Where did I get it? I truly do not have a clue. My father just randomly appeared at my home with it, just a few days before I left.
At my “home” that I won’t be visiting for quite a long time. At a “home” that I grew up in, but whose ceiling is now too low for what I can achieve. A “home” that none of my roads go through it anymore. A former home.
It is very easy to take things for granted. I, for one, took my home for granted my whole life: even in the worst of the days in my school in Venezuela, I would always come back to find comfort in the arms of my mom or the warmth of my bedroom. A “bedroom” that has my name, but hasn’t been shaken by my steps in more than two months.
Two months that could be understood as a whole life, because I never got to travel with any of my friends in Venezuela and now, I am here with Gabriel, my friend from Brazil. A person that I randomly met at Split airport on the 26th of August, but with whom now I am willing to travel with. A person that probably doesn’t know as much about me as my friends back in Venezuela, but with whom I have been writing a lot of amazing stories in these months.
Some of them are fun, but some of them are very stressing. Booking the wrong bus back to Mostar is not a fun experience, but an interesting story. It is very easy to find the charm in stressful situations if you imagine them as written stories, and it is easier to make decisions if you see yourself as an intrepid reader rather than a teenager ten thousand kilometers away from home.
Home, again. A word that did not really cross my mind before but now is bouncing inside my head almost every day. A word that I did not say because I took its existence for granted, while it was not. I find very remarkable that we tend to forget the value of the things we have in our lives because we take them for granted.
I might be complaining about being stuck in Budapest, but by doing so I take a whole lot of things for granted. First of all, being stuck in a foreign country without speaking the language is an amazing opportunity: even if you feel at risk, you are privileged to feel such risk. No opportunity comes without risks.
One of the most amazing books I have ever read is A Hundred Years of Solitude, by Gabriel García Márquez. In one of the most stunning chapters of the book, the wife of the main character says that she is willing to die in their current house just to make it home. She is willing to take the risk of dying just to have the opportunity to have a home.
And yet, the reason why she associates home with dying is because of people. The trees around it could freeze forever and the landscape remain still for a thousand years, but it wouldn’t still be home if people were not born or deceased there. Home is not about places, but about people.
When I feel homesick, I do not find myself cooking Venezuelan traditional food or eating my reserves of Venezuelan chocolate. I do not listen to our traditional music or read our national writers, but I call my parents. Home is, after all, about people.
As I write this paragraph, it is 10:53 a.m. Our new bus leaves at 12:30 and I am waiting for Gabriel to come back from a motorcycle store he wanted to see here. As I see the clock going on and on, a little bit of excitement goes through my veins at the speed of light. Even though I will arrive to Mostar later than we would have with our original bus, every minute that passes is a minute closer to being back there.
A minute closer to being back with my people. People that I met just a few months ago, but people I would be willing to die for. And home is not about a place or a tradition: home is about people. And my people is not limited to Venezuela or to Mostar: my people could be all over the world and I would still die for them.
My home could be spread throughout five continents, and it would still be completely mine. Yet, I would still like to be writing this from the comfort of my room in Mostar or in Los Teques rather than in the middle of a McDonald’s in the middle of Budapest.
Nothing is like we would wish it to be.

There’s something about solo travel that sharpens your senses. You notice the curve of a bridge, the smell of paprika, the hush before sunset. In Budapest, I didn’t need a grand itinerary — just a lightweight waterproof backpack and four slow days.
Here’s the route I followed, and why I wouldn’t change a thing.
I landed late, skipped the fuss of taxis, and dropped my bag at a quiet little hostel near the Central Market. Just before golden hour, I walked straight to the Danube.
Crossing Chain Bridge as the sky darkened felt like an old film reel — trams humming below, Parliament glowing across the water. I joined a few locals on Batthyány tér, camera in hand, watching the city pulse softly to life.
Started slow at Great Market Hall — two floors of paprika, pastries, and handmade trinkets. Bought a chilli necklace and a loaf of dark bread, both stuffed easily into the side pocket of my expandable backpack.
Climbed up to Fisherman’s Bastion by afternoon, passed a wedding shoot and a sleepy busker playing violin. Stayed for sunset, just sitting. That view? Better than anything on Google Images.
Booked the Legenda evening cruise — 8:20 PM is golden. People say to arrive early for a good seat, but I barely made it and still ended up top deck. The breeze was warm, the Parliament lit up like a palace.
Dinner was paprika pork and beer at a riverside place I stumbled into. One of those no-English-menu gems. Not fancy, just good.
Had time for one last bowl of gulyás on the Pest side. Locals swear by Getto Gulyás, and they’re not wrong. Beef, paprika, warm bread, and a bench under the trees.
Packed up in minutes. No suitcase to wrestle, just one trusty, lightweight waterproof backpack that held it all.
Budapest was a surprise — equal parts regal and relaxed. I didn’t rush, didn’t overplan. Just moved when I felt like it. That’s the thing about solo travel: you can follow your feet. And when you pack light, they carry you further.

"Essencia, Budapest: “A Match Made in Heaven of Hungarian and Portuguese cuisine” — restaurant review",https://medium.com/@samanthaxlo/essencia-budapest-a-match-made-in-heaven-of-hungarian-and-portuguese-cuisine-restaurant-9657dd38a958,"Sign up

Travelling on a student budget, a Michelin-starred restaurant seemed completely out of reach. Thanks to the generally lower prices in Eastern Europe though, Essencia turned out to be pretty affordable, a pleasant surprise for both my friend and me. Its fair price is what attracted me to the restaurant initially, but after enjoying its exceptional food and friendly service, I would have happily paid a standard Michelin price, even though that translates to Tesco meal deals for the rest of the month.
Essencia is a restaurant that creates beautiful dishes celebrating the respective Portuguese and Hungarian heritage of its owner, Tiago Sabarigo, and his wife, Eva Jenei. Despite having different mother tongues, the couple speaks the same love language for food. The delicious creations they put on the table for diners are a testament of their success as a modern business couple.
Stepping into the restaurant, we were welcomed by cordial smiles and a tranquil ambience that speaks to the restaurant’s self-assurance in bringing us a memorable experience. The interior design is not lavish in the slightest — wood and grey-coloured furniture surround the space in a humble, quiet tone. Visiting the restaurant at lunchtime to avoid a noisier dinner crowd was clearly a wise choice.
We can’t be that surprised to have been served complimentary small plates from the chef in a high-end restaurant like Essencia. Two miniature pieces of cheese sandwiched by thin crackers, topped with pumpkin gel, was one way to win our hearts over before the meal even begins. They were standing upright on a little Portuguese-style ceramic tile, looking elegant and dainty. The slightly sweetened pumpkin gel balances the naturally salty cheese — oh such an enjoyable mouthful!
We found lots to admire in the starter, ‘Hungarian water buffalo tartare’ (7,400 HUF/ ~16.8 GBP), which was served with house salted butter and scones. This dish showcases raw buffalo meat blended with egg yolk, delicately garnished with edible leaves. The melt-in-the-mouth mixture teams up perfectly with the scones which were tougher in texture. There weren’t enough scones to scoop up all the delicious tartare, but we found it equally satisfying to eat the tartare alone.
Our luck for free food doesn’t end with the cheese bites. We enjoyed soft bread, served with Distintus olive oil produced by a family business in a small village in the north of Portugal. I was convinced that this wouldn’t taste any different from supermarket olive oil, but I was gladly proven wrong. The olive oil carries walnut and almond notes, and is incredibly clear. Despite soaking the entire slice of bread in it, there were no oily residues at all.
Although priced similarly, the ‘Mangalica, wild mushrooms, dumplings’ (8,900 HUF/ ~20.2 GBP) was much more impressive than the ‘Traditional octopus rice’ (8,800 HUF/ ~20.0 GBP). Despite sounding promising, the Portuguese-inspired octopus rice was so salty that it becomes bland after a few mouthfuls. Perhaps it would be better enjoyed if the sauce was not drowning the rice completely. That said, the octopus was served in generous portions and did bring freshness from the sea.
The Mangalica is a local breed of pig in Hungary, which was grilled to perfection with a tinge of pink in the middle. It is tender all the way through, complimented by the crunchy breadcrumbs served on the side. The server poured a deep, flavourful mushroom sauce gracefully on the side, and I’ve got to admire any dish presented with such theatricality. The dish is served with a side of sharp pickled mushrooms and Hungarian nokedli (dumplings), which made it more vibrant and filling.
After enjoying the main course, another complimentary small plate was gifted to us — two pieces of pastel de nata. Dusted with cinnamon powder, the Portuguese egg custard tart was very palatable indeed. The gooeyness of the custard juxtaposes with the tart’s crispy edges and crunchy surface, creating a kind of textural symphony. These tarts were served on the same Portuguese-style ceramic tile as the cheese bites, bringing the meal to a full circle. It is not only a reminder of the restaurant’s tribute to Portuguese cuisine, but also of the chef’s attention to detail and generosity in serving us tasty small plates.
The rule of a ‘second stomach for dessert’ did not apply that day. The ‘Apple pie, créme fraiche, vanilla’ (4,900 HUF/ ~11.1 GBP) sounded like a perfect full-stop to the meal but we were too fulfilled to enjoy it properly. The ‘Pão de Ló’ (4,500 HUF, ~10.2 GBP), a kind of Portugese sponge cake, also makes a good excuse for me to revisit Essencia! From the amiable service, sophisticated interior, to the truly remarkable and creative plates of food, Essecia no doubt deserves to be adorned with a Michelin star. Next time I travel to Budapest, I will be taking an Uber to Essencia the moment I leave the airport.

Wes Anderson is slowly assuming his ultimate form. This is my observation as a long time fan of his films. He is embracing his quirks and tropes and coming more and more into his own. I have always loved how his movies are so multifaceted. They are dramatic stories with lots of comedy and always a touch of melancholy. Grand Budapest Hotel continues that tradition telling the story of a precocious lobby boy and his gallant mentor Mr. Gustav played by Ralph Fiennes in rare form. His character is a Quixotic hotel concierge who drops so many great lines and pearls of wisdom you’ll be quoting him for weeks.
Mixed into this setup we get a classic murder mystery and a hero’s journey set in a gorgeously constructed vision of mid 20th century Europe. The attention to detail is impressive as is always the case in Anderson’s films. It is a bit overwrought at times. We probably didn’t need quite so many narrative framing devices and cameos (the casting is so good frankly it feels like a flex at this point). Yet the core story is heartfelt and it is all filmed so beautifully. Not my favorite Anderson film but still easy to recommend.
Grade: B+

The cab dropped us off five minutes to midnight in front of the Athens train station. Without wasting an instant, we grabbed our bags and ran.
The train was grimy and packed. We had to hoist our luggage- one suitcase apiece- onto the racks at the end of the car. Even though it was an overnight train, the seats did not recline, nor were the flickering, incandescent lights turned off.
The entire ride, a man’s snores filled the car.
I still tried to sleep, even though my legs were cramped from my seated position and I woke every few moments with panic, eyes searching for my suitcase in the pile of luggage, heart not resting until I found it. As it was, the lights and sonorous snores made what little sleep I got a miracle.
The train pulled in to Thessaloniki, the major city in Northern Greece, a little after 6 am.
We emerged to a ghost station. Nothing open. No people. Our suitcases were loud against the tile floor.
“What time is our bus?” I asked my friend Jordan.
“Three,” he said.
Nine hours. My eyes were already drooping, my body was shutting down. No way I would make it.
Then there was the worry. Because when I’d said, “Our bus,” what I’d meant was, “The bus to Budapest that we tried to buy tickets for a few days ago and were told we could only get in person, but not to worry, it would be fine.” We had an address for a ticket office, a two and a half week itinerary starting in Budapest, already booked, and no backup plan.
Finally, we found an open cafe inside the station. We each got a coffee and a sandwich. I took a two-hour nap in the vinyl booth, curled up like a cat, my backpack as my pillow.
The cafe had Wifi, too, which was good. We found the hours of the bus station, as well as its location on Google Maps.
“It’s half a mile’s walk,” Jordan said, squinting a little at his screen.
I nodded, fantasizing all the while about finding one of those motels that charged by the hour and sleeping for a few. Maybe the walk would help me stay awake.
Suitcases in tow, we took to the streets of Thessaloniki. We’d both been there before as part of our abroad program. It’s a vibrant city, full of students and cafes and pastry shops. I was thinking we might stop at one of those places, thinking that the warm air outside and the energy of the city might make me feel better.
But it was pouring rain that day. Luckily, both of us had the presence of mind to bring umbrellas, but there was only so much an umbrella could stop during a half a mile’s walk in the deluge.
We were the only people in the ticket office. The man behind the desk looked us up and down. Wet hair, wet shoes, suitcases dripping on the floor. “Would you like some tea?” he asked.
We nodded. “Efcharisto.”
We set our suitcases down on the chairs in the reception area and took a moment to sit, to shake off some of the wet, though it was air-conditioned inside and my hands were turning purple.
“Do you have a bathroom?” I asked. The man pointed the way to an upstairs office.
When I came back, I was handed my tea. “Efcharisto polli.”
Jordan looked mildly concerned. “He says we can’t buy a ticket to Budapest.”
My heart fell. Two and a half weeks of booked hostels and trains, carefully planned, gone. Shit.
But the man was shaking his head, “No, no, no,” he said, referring to Jordan.
“No? We can go?” It rose again.
The man looked hesitant. He spoke in broken English, and Jordan and I tried to make sense of it with each of our one semester of Modern Greek and three years of Ancient. And finally, we understood what was going on, even though we had not learned words for things like “customs strike” or “border.”
“Beograd,” the man finished after switching back to Greek.
“Beograd?” Jordan repeated.
The man nodded.
We exchanged glances. “Wait. Belgrade? In Serbia?”
The man nodded.
“And can we get from Belgrade to Budapest?” I asked.
“Oh, easy,” the man said, shrugging it off in a very Greek way.
My heart pounded. Suppose we got stuck in Belgrade? But what other choice did we have?
“Fifty Euros each,” the man said.
Jordan and I locked eyes. Then I handed over my credit card.
The bus left from the main station across town. In the still-pouring rain, we walked to the nearest bus stop and waited, then boarded the bus and rode it fifteen stops before realizing that we were going the wrong way. Crossing the street was like fording a river. A river with a lot of oncoming traffic.
We each got a gyro, our last gyro after four months of living in Greece, in the main bus station and we sat and talked for a time. Fifteen minutes till our bus was to leave, we wandered around to find it.
Then we were running again because this bus left from half a mile up the road. We took a cab there and sprinted into an empty, tiny station.
“Belgrade? Bus?” I gasped in broken Greek. “To leophorio?”
The woman behind the desk nodded. “It’s coming,” she said.
So we sat.
There was air conditioning on blast. I unzipped my soaked suitcase and dug out a pair of thick socks and a sweater.
“Thank god the bus is late,” I said.
“Yeah,” Jordan replied.
The bus station had Wifi, too, another miracle. I took the time to send my parents an update, send some friends a Snapchat with the caption “NBD, going to Serbia.”
The time seemed to crawl by. But Jordan and I each had a book to read.
We checked our watches some time later. It was five in the afternoon, a full two hours after our bus was supposed to leave. There had been no movement in the station in all the time that we had been waiting. Not a single coming or going.
I was getting nervous. Again, that trip we’d painstakingly booked flashed before my eyes. “It’s not coming,” I said.
Jordan shook his head. “If I’ve learned one thing about Greece it’s that the bus is coming. It may be hours late — but it will be there.”
Despite my worry, I smiled. He had a point.
And, true to form, the bus did come. Another hour later.
It was one of those coach buses that I used to take on school field trips. One with rainbow seats and a built-in bathroom, as well as a small screen suspended every five rows. Our luggage was stowed in the underbelly, and we each got a row of seats to ourselves. The lap of luxury, compared to the train from Athens.
The bus to Budapest we had researched was supposed to leave at 3 pm and arrive at 8 am. This bus was three hours late and supposed to drop us off much closer in our journey. When, exactly, it would arrive was anyone’s guess.
For a while, we sat and read in our seats, and I relaxed. Okay. We were on the bus. It wasn’t the bus to Budapest, but we were leaving Greece, and we would be able to get to Budapest eventually. Hopefully. I even started to doze off and on, though it was still light out.
The Northern Greece flitting by was very different from the rest of the country I had come to know. Here were lush forests, farms. I had become accustomed to the yellow-green, grey, and shocking blue color palette of Athens and the islands, the “rocky Greece” of Homer, not this deep green and brown with the sun starting to set purple through the clouds.
After a few hours of watching the land go by, though, there was something familiar. A few hills, valleys between them, and then, against a water tank on the side of the road in huge, bold letters, the tag: “Fuck the Border Police.”
Behind it was a field of tents. Hundreds if not thousands of them, a rainbow of colors in various states of wear. They filled a whole valley. The bus going at highway speed took several long moments to pass them.
“Whoa,” Jordan said, looking out his window on the other side of the road from me. Filled as well.
I kept watching the side of the road after that. Trying to catch a better glimpse. Trying to understand better what I had just seen. All I saw, though, was the asphodel that grew unchecked in thickets on the side of the road, and distant villages that I would never visit.
Asphodel. That was the afterlife, according to the Ancient Greeks. Your spirit standing forever in the Fields of Asphodel, waiting for something that would never come.
Ten minutes later, we stopped at the border. The driver collected our passports, descended, and returned with them stamped. On we drove.
That was what struck me the most, I think. How easy it was. For me.
We stopped at the first gas station on the side of the road in Macedonia, only a mile from the border. Jordan and I disembarked and stretched.
I walked into the station, which looked exactly like every gas station I have ever been inside aside from the Cyrillic lettering of the big, red sign. I wandered around for a minute, thought about buying a snack, and then realized with a great shock that we were out of the Euro zone. I had no money, here.
I left a little while later, looking out onto the road. The day was turning grey and dark.
When I was getting back on the bus I turned around and took my camera out to take this picture:
A man immediately started yelling at me and coming closer, and I put down the camera, heart racing.
“No photos!” He said.
“Okay, okay,” I said, making a show of turning off my camera and putting it away.
“I guess we’re still too close to the border,” Jordan muttered as I filed back onto the bus with him.
Darkness fell soon after. The bus driver had a movie playing on all the screens. Burnt starring Bradley Cooper. I watched for a while.
It was hard to sleep for a second night in a row sitting up. I had never before appreciated the importance of lying down to a good night’s sleep.
I eventually found a way to stretch out, legs extended over the aisle, a bridge between the rows of seats, with my backpack as my pillow.
We were woken some time a few hours later to exit the bus, yawning, freezing in the cold, passports in hand. After a few minutes in line, I handed mine over. It was stamped. I retreated back to the warmth of the bus.
We were in Serbia.
At three in the morning by the clock on the bus, we came to our final stop.
“Belgrade.”
Jordan and I shuffled off. We retrieved our suitcases, which were standing at attention on the side of the road, already removed from their lonely compartment.
“There’s the train station,” the bus driver said, pointing across five lanes of street. I stared at it, at the large steps leading up to the yellow façade. My eyes traveled counterclockwise, from building to building, all covered in shadows, all labeled, some in neon, with words from a language that I did not know. There were no people on the streets. The wind had a deep chill.
As I watched, the bus stirred behind me and then was gone.
Jordan and I crossed the empty streets, bags in tow rolling loudly behind us.
Up the steps we went, through the façade, through the atrium, to an open-air plaza with four tracks in front of us. To the right was a separate complex with a door and guard. To the left, the building façade extended. A closed café had outdoor tables in front of it. Quite a few people, silent and somber, were seated there, huddled up to stave off the cold.
We both started to the left, away from the people. There was a light on in a room built into the station and we peeked inside.
A man emerged, brisk. His hair was cropped, his dress was military. A massive gun was strapped across his chest and in his hands.
Stammering, we asked in English, “Ticket booth?”
His face did not change. He pointed to a door past the café, past the collection of huddled people.
We thanked him and he returned to his room.
Still trembling, a little, we walked through the gauntlet of people, through the doors, and into a dark ticket office. We sat on stone barriers as others were doing. I looked at the station clock and my heart sank when I realized that we had crossed time zones. It was 2 am here. Three hours until the ticket office would open.
The station was not empty. Many people sat with their bags. The glowing screen of the arrival and departure times indicated that there would be a few trains every hour until we left. Nobody was talking.
I pulled out my book, Gone Girl, and Jordan did the same with his. I read, fighting exhaustion. I had never been so tired. My shoes were still wet from the rain in Thessaloniki. And perhaps it was the image of the gun carried by the guard, perhaps it was the fact that I was reading a thriller, but whenever someone so much as moved in the silence of the train station, the back of my neck prickled.
At some point, Jordan left to find the bathroom, and I sat with both our bags, alone in the dark, heart thumping until he came back.
“Well,” he said in a hushed voice when he returned. “You have to pay to use the bathroom. And pay extra for toilet paper.”
“Seriously?”
“Yep.”
The time passed in dollops. I started to mark the progression of the morning not by the clock, but by the gradual lightening of the sky, taking comfort in the small amounts of light that were slowing trickling into the sky.
Air that smelled like autumn came with the rising of the sun, though the city did not get warmer.
The light calmed me a little. It made the blank stares that I would occasionally exchange with the other people in the station feel less sinister. It made me see behind those stares, to the eyelids drooping, the hands clutching bags close, and remember that they, too, were here for a reason.
The ticket office opened ten minutes after five.
When we were two from the front, I turned to Jordan in a panic. “What’s the exchange rate, here?”
“Oh no,” he said. He pulled out his phone to furiously Google.
But before we could find an answer, it was our turn. “Two tickets to Budapest?” I said.
The woman said something back to me in Serbian. Then, at my blank stare, she handed me the receipt. It said 40,000.00 of their currency.
I stared at it. I looked back to Jordan. I stared at the paper again. “Well…” I gave her my card. It wasn’t declined. Well. Good news for that, at least.
We got our tickets and noticed, to our dismay, that the train departed at 7:20 am. So we had two more hours to kill.
I lent Jordan my jacket and we walked a little away to find a coffee shop, because we both needed caffeine desperately.
We boarded the train on time, and it left on time. And we chugged along, passing by green fields and villages, stopping occasionally as we went and exchanging passengers.
We had meant to take turns napping, to have someone keep an eye on our bags just in case, but I kept falling asleep when it was my turn to keep watch.
“Emilllllllyyyy,” Jordan kept saying.
“Sorry,” I kept replying.
After hours of traveling, a woman came through, checking and stamping passports.
Once in Hungary, I thought that it couldn’t possibly be long now. For hours I peered across the vast, flat land and just kept thinking, “I will see the city soon,” but only saw flat and green.
I really tried to stay awake, but in the end, I spent the entire ride drifting unwillingly in and out of sleep, fighting hard against my exhaustion but losing every battle. Each time I opened my eyes, I’d see new shades of green in farms, in fields, in bushes, and in the forests of thin-trunked trees, and then my eyelids would clamp down again like heavy metal doors.
Close. A dream of checking the time, reaching for my bag.
Open. I’d jolt, my cheek pressed against the window, no idea what time it was, and all I’d see were fields.
Close. A dream of talking to someone, starting to see the city on the horizon.
Open. I checked to make sure that my bag was still safe on the seat next to me. Jordan was asleep across from me, cheek to shoulder. Oops.
And then my eyes snapped open, and we were there.

In the past few weeks, my wife and I decided to take a short, few-day trip to visit some Central European cities. When organizing the trip, we considered two important aspects. The first and most important was that we would only use public transportation during our journey. The second was that we would organize a trip involving several Central European countries.
It wasn’t easy to organize this short, 5-day getaway under these conditions. However, after careful planning, we managed to complete our spring itinerary. As a result, our program plan is shaped as follows.
From Budapest, the capital of Hungary, we traveled by train to Graz, Austria’s second-largest city. After a few days’ stay there, we would also take the train to Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. Here we would stay for two nights as well, and then return to Budapest by long-distance bus.
This writing summarizes our travel experiences. I hope it will be as enjoyable and useful for readers as we enjoyed this active relaxation.

On a recent vacation, we spent a few extra days in Budapest. The first day after we arrived we went on a private walking tour. I thought I’d share not only images but also some advice and tips for taking photos during a tour.
When I made the reservation for the tour I let the tour guide know that I was a photographer and wanted to be sure I had a little time to get some decent images without being rushed. Granted, there were three other people on the tour so this was not all about photography in any way.
Do your homework as well. Look up the locations you know you’ll be stopping at. This particular tour was described as including city highlights with specific sites listed. It also touted hidden gems, you know, the places only locals know about. And a stop for a local delicacy along the way.

Dating while living and working in a foreign country can either be 1 or 2 things — exciting and interesting or an absolute wasteland. For me it is a wasteland. The facts are this. I am a Black woman living and working in Budapest, Hungary. I have a decent job and a decent apartment, but a man — decent or otherwise, is nowhere in sight. And like Carrie said, “.. you’re always looking for a job, a boyfriend or an apartment” and I had 2 out of the 3 so I considered myself to be marginally blessed. Now, this is not a lament — this is just me stating some facts about my life as a Black expat living in Central Europe.
I left — read fled — New York at a time when my personal and professional life was in turmoil. My family had suffered a traumatic loss and my boss at the time was a heartless idiot who repeatedly questioned why I needed to support them as much as I did. So when the offer to move to Budapest came, I readily accepted and quit my job on the spot. Now, 5 years later I can say it was one of the best decisions I ever made. It is one that I have never regretted, despite the lack of any worthy romantic entanglements. Not to say I had a flourishing love life in NYC, no it was dismal too, but I was very focused on climbing the corporate ladder and enjoying my busy social life with my equally career focused single friends.
