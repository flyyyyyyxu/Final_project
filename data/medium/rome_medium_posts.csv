“If the whole world lived in their favorite vacation spots, then the whole world would live in Hawaii and Italy and Cleveland.”
Floyd to Liz, 30 Rock, Season 1, Episode 20 “Cleveland”
That is one of my favorite TV Show quotes ever. What Floyd from 30 Rock is really saying is that everyone loves Italy, right? Well, actually, we didn’t love Italy and we very nearly hated Rome. Rome was the next stop on our month-long tour of Europe, which started in the United Kingdom. (You can check out our UK itinerary and trip information here, here, and here.)
I was particularly looking forward to visiting Italy. After I’d gone to Rome in my 20’s, I thought of it as one of my favorite cities in the world. Now, perhaps because we went during tourist season or because I have different travel tastes, it’s basically a reeking cesspool of humanity with some amazing historic structures and art. Ok, ok, maybe I’m being too harsh here. There are some highly delightful things to do in Rome, but I’m going to take off my rose-colored Italy glasses right now and share with you all of the Roman highlights: the good, the bad, and the ugly.
This was our Italy itinerary. We didn’t actually bike around Italy like my map shows, we took the train, but this is where we went. We started with five full days in Rome and then got out into the countryside from there.
Let’s start by talking about the highlights, starting with the good stuff and moving down to the bad.
One of my favorite Italian adventures was Pompeii. Seeing Pompeii has been on my bucket list for a really long time and it did not disappoint. You can get down to Pompeii from Rome and back in a day. Typically, you’d drive or take a tour bus and it would take 15 hours or so to take the tour, but we found a tour that took us to Pompeii by high speed train. We got an amazing guided tour of Pompeii for around two hours and then went to a local winery with very good wine and very good food. We were home by 5pm instead of the normal 9 or 10pm for the typical Pompeii tour from Rome.
Pompeii itself was truly amazing! We saw the original streets, bars, residences with beautiful frescoes and mosaic floors, political graffiti, the famous brothel, the forum, an amphitheater, and plaster casts of Pompeiians just as they were discovered. There is a section of Pompeii that just opened up to visitors where you can see some of the most amazing frescoes in the whole town, a bakery complete with intact terracotta ovens, and large wine jars, also completely intact. The whole time you’re touring in the shadows of Mt. Vesuvius, just as the Pompeiians lived. I highly recommend taking a tour through Pompeii with a tour guide as ours added a lot to our visit.
Italian food is fresh and delicious. Yes, the pizza is the best pizza you’ll ever eat in your life. Yes, they do gelato better than any other ice cream in the world. And, yes, the pasta is also amazing and you can eat at a new restaurant every single night and never get the same dish twice. But, we did get sick of pizza and pasta by the end of our trip. We found an Indian restaurant on our first night in Florence and were relieved to have a little variety.
Our very favorite meals were the ones that we ate in tiny restaurants tucked into narrow streets, far from the throngs of tourists. There was a six table place down the street from our AirBNB with wine racks covering the walls. We had an amazing carbonara there. We also had a wonderful meal in a three-table restaurant in Vernazza (Cinqueterre), where we were scrunched in a corner and had to keep moving to let the waitress by. They had the best seafood linguini I’ll probably ever have in my life.
We got used to having wine with all of our meals and gelato on almost a daily basis. I won’t miss Rome, but I will miss the food.
First up on our list of “bad” Italian experiences is seeing the ancient Roman ruins. If you haven’t seen the famous ancient Roman sites yet, go. They themselves are amazing. I adore the Colosseum and Roman Forum. I love standing there and imagining life around 100 AD and I loved learning about ancient Rome.
But, these sites bring new meaning to the word “crowded”, at least during peak tourist season. There are so many tourists that you can’t freely move around. There are so many aggressive salesmen lying to you about their work and just trying to make a sale. Tourists pose everywhere, sometimes for 30–60 minutes trying to get the perfect selfie. No wonder the Italians are sick of us.
You must buy timed tickets ahead of time to most sites and none of the Italian websites are easy to navigate. I ended up just booking tours that came with tickets so I at least had a ticket and a guide. Just trying to see a few sites is hot (in June/July), uncomfortable, and annoying. It’s quite frankly not worth it. I don’t think I ever need to go back.
The Vatican Museums and Saint Peter’s Basilica are equally as crowded. They are beautiful and filled with famous works of art. At times, I loved it, but mostly I felt a bit like I did in the British Museum, where most items have been stolen from other cultures. I couldn’t stop thinking about how much money the Catholic leaders accepted from ordinary Catholics, telling them they could pay to get into heaven, then turning around and building the most ornate buildings in the world. We learned during our Colosseum tour that the Colosseum was once covered in marble. Then, the Vatican (as well as others) gutted the place so they could build St. Peter’s and other structures. I didn’t grow up Catholic and I have no tolerance for the Catholic church’s patriarchal views and other ongoing bullshit. So, visiting the Vatican was both mesmerizing and deeply appalling. No need to visit the Vatican again.
OK, now we’re getting into the “ugly” territory. After traveling around the UK for a couple of weeks, we got used to trains that were clean and ran on time. There seems to be no such thing in Italy. Trains are gross, packed, late, and graffitied. Buses don’t run on time and sometimes skip whole portions of their routes. Not to worry, you can just take a taxi, right?
Wrong. Italy doesn’t not have enough taxi drivers so the drivers they do have will only pick you up if they want to go exactly where you need to go. Especially at the airport. Finding a taxi at 11pm when we arrived was a nightmare. Everyone made up excuses until we found a great driver who needed to get home to our neighborhood. We also had a horrific experience trying to get from the airport to our final night’s hotel on the seaside in a town 25 minutes away. No one would take us. Not taxi drivers, not Uber drivers. No one. So, we spent two hours trying to figure out the bus system and I nearly lost it. If you go to Rome, find a place to stay that you can walk to from the Roma Termini train station. The train between the airport and Termini is great.
Luckily, we stayed in a place in Rome near the Campo d’Fiori, a famous outdoor market within walking distance (30–45 minutes) of the Roman Forum, Termini, and the Vatican. So, most of the time we were in Rome, we didn’t have to fight their public transit system.
And there you have it. My take on Rome: the good, the bad, and the ugly. I highly recommend visiting Italy during the off-season. The heat and the crowds were a major contributing factor to our impression of the country. But I sincerely also suggest you visit another country. So many people rave about Italy and I honestly don’t think it’s worth the hype. If you’re debating between Italy and somewhere else, do yourself a favor and pick somewhere else. Italy will be there for you to see later if you really need to go.

I always make it a habit when I travel to dig into understanding the history of countries and how it shapes their future. Ancient Rome was once a small village that rose to dominate the Mediterranean…

Many a poet has referred to Rome as the eternal city due to its seemingly immortal beauty, which has enchanted locals and visitors alike for millennia. It goes without saying that one day is not nearly enough time to fully appreciate, or even see, the thousands of years of history and culture located within, but until October 2, 2015, that’s exactly how much time I’d spent there.
See, three years earlier during a family trip to Germany, my parents, sister, and I hopped in Oma’s VW Rabbit and embarked on a whirlwind tour of Italy, southern France, and the Alps. In the time most would dedicate to Rome alone, we drove from Frankfurt to Venice via Austria, then to Florence, Siena, Rome, Pisa, Monaco, and Nice, before finishing up with a nearly non-stop dash from Cannes back to Frankfurt — we stopped once in Switzerland for the most scenic cold gas station pizza I’ve ever eaten.
We were on such a tight schedule that in Siena, for example, when we took a wrong turn and missed the famous town square by just a few streets, we simply stopped at a grocery store to quickly grab ice cream, then kept on driving towards Rome.
With that in mind, it may come as a surprise that we opted to stay an hour outside the city instead of finding a place in the midst of it all. If you are at all familiar with Roman traffic and the absolute disregard for rules, if any exist to begin with, however, our decision makes a lot of sense.
On the morning of our day in Rome, we parked the car at the station next to our eco-sport resort hotel and hopped on a train into town. As it wobbled back and forth on the tracks, the countryside gave way to industry, then apartment blocks, then all of a sudden we were there.
Rome, unlike say, Paris or New York, is the type of city that sneaks up on you. You feel like you could be anywhere and then all of a sudden, boom, you’re thrust into the middle of everything. There are no tall landmarks to warn you of your imminent descent into chaos.
We spent a total of 12 hours in Rome, running about trying to fit in as much as possible. We ticked off a few of our must-dos, the Coliseum, the Trevi Fountain, and Roman cuisine, but the list of stuff we missed was far longer.
Needless to say, I vowed to go back, and in 2015 I did. After nearly a year working at Value Village, I “quit” to travel for a bit, and mapped out a two-and-a-half-month long trip that took me to Toronto and New York, then over to Europe. Most of my time there was spent with family in Germany, but I also spent a couple weeks exploring southern and northern ends of the continent as well.
After visiting Paris, Torino, Bergamo, and Athens, I found myself once again in the eternal city, this time with three whole days to explore.
After flying in from Greece, I hopped on a train into town. When I stepped out of Roma Termini, I was taken aback by the sheer assault on my senses. The smell of fresh-baked goods and garbage mingled in my nose, producing a lovechild that wasn’t quite pleasant, but not entirely repulsive either. I heard people shouting at one another, but when I turned to look, I realized they were just speaking Italian; both had smiles on their faces.
And the horns. All around me locals zipped about on Vespas, beeping and showcasing both the country’s lax helmet policies and the city’s nonexistent traffic laws. Somehow, though, it worked. I didn’t understand why, but who was I to question a city that had been around that long.
I decided to knock out the famous sites first before delving into my preferred attraction, the city itself.
After a quick hop over to the Coliseum and other places you’d find on a Lonely Planet “Top 10” list, I made my way down to a neighbourhood called Trastavere. It’s the type of place that shows up on tourist maps, but is often overlooked. Wanting to explore the area sans local guide while still learning, I’d procured an audio tour by travel legend Rick Steves. He, and the impact he’s had on my life, warrant their own episode, but I digress.
Phone in hand, headphones in ear, I pressed play and began walking. As I passed through old courtyards with even older fountains, Rick told me about their history, and the role they played in present day Rome. Just as I neared the end of the tour, I saw a raindrop fall on my screen, followed by another, and another. Before long, it was a full on downpour.
I sought shelter under an awning, and, unable to check in to my hotel for a few more hours, looked on Google Maps for somewhere to wait out the storm. I wasn’t hungry, so I ignored all the restaurants, I didn’t want to stand around, so shopping was out of the question. Wait, what about a bookstore? There was a chain with numerous locations around the city called Feltrinelli, so I picked the closest open one, and headed over.
Upon arrival, I quickly realized that I had stumbled into a local shop. Everything was Italian — well, almost everything. There was a small English section with a variety of old and new titles. I looked at the options, and came across Oliver Sacks’ “The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat.” Perfect! See, at the time I was very into neuroscience and psychology, and had just the day before listened to a BBC podcast featuring Sacks, who had recently passed away.
Book in hand, I found a comfy chair by the window overlooking the street and sat down. I put some Italian instrumental on and cracked open the pages, losing myself in Sacks’ prose.
A couple hours later, I felt a rumble in my stomach. Time for lunch. I spent a few minutes looking for a place to eat on Google Maps, and came across this little restaurant nearby that had barely any reviews, all of which were in Italian, and no website. Perfect.
I did my best to uncrease “The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat” before placing it back on the shelf and walking out. A few twists and turns down back alleys later, I found myself at the restaurant. There was one small Italian sign out front advertising what, I assumed, was a 5-course meal, but if you weren’t looking for it, you couldn’t be blamed for walking right past.
Upon entering, I was greeted by the host, who, quickly realizing I was a foreigner, began speaking in broken English. He guided me to a table in the main dining area, and I sat down, noticing that I was the only one there. My earlier suspicions were confirmed when the waiter came by and informed me that the special of the day was, in fact, a five-course meal. Knowing it would likely be my only meal of the day, I went for it. He smiled, and hurried back into the kitchen.
The waiter returned a short time later with, I kid you not, a litre of wine and another of water. I poured a glass of the former and sank deeper into the well-worn seat of my chair. He then brought what I, in my naïvite, thought were the first four courses: green lentil soup, olive oil marinated tomatoes with fresh basil, prosciutto and mozzarella balls, and a basket of bread.
As I took my first bite, I looked up and saw an old woman peeking out from behind the wall that blocked off entry to the kitchen. She watched my every move, smiling as I dug in and returned an approving gesture.
When the plates holding what I soon learned had just been the antipasto were taken away, the waiter returned with the primo course, homemade pasta with two types of sauce.
“Grazi,” I said before digging in, alternating between the red and the white. When I looked up from my first bite, the old woman had moved closer, sitting at a table near the aforementioned wall. Once again I returned an approving gesture, and continued eating.
When every last lick of sauce had been cleaned from the plate, it was whisked away, another three taking its place on the table in front of me. The secondi course consisted of marinated fish from the Mediterranean, homemade potato chips, and Roman-style spinach.
I began with the latter, twirling a few strands around my fork and bringing it up to my mouth. It was only when I shovelled it in that I realized Roman-style meant cold. Now I’m not a fan of the vegetable to begin with, so this came as a bit of a surprise. Knowing who was watching, however, I tried my best to pretend I was enjoying it. From her vantage point now two tables away, the old woman chuckled and gave me an approving nod. Feeling as though I’d passed some sort of test, I finished the spinach with a smile.
The dolce and digestivo courses, a lemon curd cake and mango liqueur, arrived together shortly after I took my last bite of the fish and chips, as it were. As I took a bite and sip, in that order, I looked up. The old woman was sitting at the table right in front of me now. Any closer and we would have been asked, “together or separate?” when the cheque arrived.
For the fourth time, I transcended language barriers by exhibiting the universal gesture for “tasty.” She appeared oblivious to any such barrier, and launched into a conversation with me, in Italian.
I nodded along, smiling when her words sounded happy and donning a concerned expression when she pointed at the empty tables around us and frowned.
After a few minutes, the waiter came back out and said something to her, at which point she scurried back to the kitchen. He presented me with the cheque; everything I’d just devoured came to €25. At the time, that seemed like a lot, but looking back on it now, it was a deal.
I paid up, extended a round of “grazi”s to the waiter, the old woman who I learned was his nonna, and a chef, his brother, who emerged from the kitchen to see me off, then walked out of the restaurant.
The rain had subsided, the dark clouds giving way to blue sky. I looked at my phone, and realized it was time to check in to my hotel. It was a quick ride on the metro, but stomach full, I opted instead to walk.
I wandered through the streets in the hotel’s general direction, observing Romans as I went. Before long, however, the Italian conversations I heard were replaced by those being held in English, Japanese, and German. I glanced over at a sign hanging in front of a nearby restaurant. It was in four languages, confirming my fear that I’d unwittingly entered a touristy area.
As I made my way through the square, I saw countless other visitors sitting on crowded “ristorante tradizionale” patios with fellow foreigners, shelling out €25 for a pizza.
On one hand, I felt sorry for them for missing out on what I had just experienced, but on the other, I was happy places like the one I dined at were still unknown to all but the most curious and competent of travellers.
I was tempted to spread the word about the restaurant tucked away in the back alley a few streets down, but the only thing I feared more than them going out of business was returning next time to find that their menu was no longer only in Italian, and that the tables were filled with influencers too busy sharing the hidden gem with their followers to truly enjoy the experience. For the record, I only took my phone out to take pictures of each course, and waited until I returned to the hotel to post them. Most importantly, I did not name the restaurant, nor did I pin its location.
Over the next couple days, while I did venture down to the Vatican to admire the architecture, I spent pretty much all my time in areas not listed in any tourist brochure. I shopped at grocery stores where nobody spoke English, dined al fresco in local parks, and rode the bus alongside those on their way to work or running errands.
When people ask me now what they should see in Rome, my answer is always, “Rome.” I encourage them to hop on a bus and see where it goes, dine places where they don’t even know what they’re ordering, and truly immerse themselves in the city.
My southern excursion ended with an overnight train from Rome to Munich, for which I had declined to book a sleeping cabin. I was still at the stage in my travel career, and age, that I could sacrifice comfort at the altar of saving a few bucks and still feel fine the next morning.
As the train pulled out of Roma Termini, I pulled out a bag of things I’d picked up at a grocery store and laid them out on the table. Thankfully, the other passengers in the compartment weren’t getting on until Firenze, so until then I had it all to myself. I first went for the tomatoes with olive oil and fresh basil, pairing them with prosciutto and mozzarella.
As I took my first bite, I looked up, half expecting to see the old woman staring back at me. Though it was just me and my reflection in the window, I smiled and gave an approving gesture nonetheless…

Spending a summer in Rome, or anywhere in Italy, has long been on my bucket list, one I hoped to check off by the time I turned 30. However, the universe had other plans, and I found myself traveling there this summer at just 22 years old. The excitement was palpable as I anticipated visiting the iconic sites I had seen in encyclopedias and documentaries.
Those visuals—especially depicting battles and mythological tales— shaped my understanding of history. Although I’ve always been enchanted by Greek mythology, the allure of the Roman Empire is undeniable, I found myself both enchanted and repelled by the city.
I traveled with my mom, and we spent a few days first in Milan, then Verona, and Venice, before finally arriving in Rome. The train journey from Verona to Rome was straightforward and economical compared to other kinds of transportation, although our arrival was anything but pleasant.
The central train station was dirty and chaotic, reminiscent of a jungle. It was like that infamous scene from Mean Girls, where teenage life is likened to the wild antics of animals in the jungle, except without the comedic elements.
The station was filled with unruly crowds, a stark contrast to the pristine and gorgeous Milan Centrale, and it felt as though many of the travelers had never experienced civilized travel etiquette.
As we navigated the streets from the station to our hotel on Via Marsala—1.7 kilometers away—we were confronted with a shocking amount of litter. Having lived in Egypt for years, I thought I was prepared for extreme levels of pollution. Yet, this was Rome, a city many consider a first-world destination!
We couldn't help but feel disheartened about the historic sites we came to explore, deciding to lower our expectations. The walls were marred with vulgar graffiti, plastered with posters advocating for communism and the freedom of Palestine, which are important movements, yet for being such a historical and touristic city, these messages felt completely out of place.
What struck us most was the sight of people living on the streets—men and women surrounded by their belongings, some sleeping, others attending to their bodily needs or taking drugs. Witnessing such stark poverty in a city steeped in history was heart-wrenching. Our otherwise lovely trip to Italy took a downturn the moment we stepped into Rome. All of this unfolded in a span of maybe 45 minutes. What could we possibly expect for the rest of our stay?
Once we checked into our hotel, my mom suggested we take a moment to rest before embarking on our walking itinerary, which included the stunning Basilica of Santa María Maggiore, the Roman Coliseum, the Roman Forum, and the Victor Emmanuel II Monument.
Our spirits lifted slightly upon entering the Basilica, which was breathtaking both outside and in, with gold details adorning every surface. We then set off toward the Coliseum, and we could see it while walking along the Oppian Hill.
While it was indeed an impressive structure, being the largest construction of the Roman Empire, I found the hype surrounding it somewhat exaggerated. It didn’t match the grandeur depicted in countless documentaries and books. More than half of the structure has been replaced or supported by modern restoration efforts, which is understandable given its age, but it detracted from the authenticity. Nevertheless, it was a landmark worth checking off our itinerary.
Adjacent to the Coliseum lies the Roman Forum, easily viewable from the outside, which negated the need for us to purchase tickets. This led us to a lengthy walk, almost two kilometers more, through the remnants of Roman temples and architecture until we reached the Altar of the Fatherland, honoring Victor Emmanuel II.
This was undoubtedly my favorite part of the day. Victor Emmanuel II, the first king of unified Italy, played a crucial role in bringing together disparate kingdoms, fostering peace and unity among them. His story is fascinating, and his monument is nothing short of extraordinary.
The architecture and panoramic views of Rome from the top are breathtaking. Scattered sculptures of the twelve gods—Roman adaptations of the Greek deities—surround the site. It’s amusing how Rome appropriated so much from Greek culture, including its mythology, architecture, and even major elements of Catholicism, effectively erasing the origins and making them their own.
As the day waned, we needed to head back to the hotel. The journey back was over three kilometers, and we only walked a few meters before fatigue set in. We attempted to call a taxi, but in Italy, you must use an app, and you’ll need an Italian phone number for that (at least for the most popular app, itTaxi). In other cities, our hotel staff assisted us with this. With the sun setting, we didn’t want to risk being out too late.
Frustrated and weary, we decided to walk to the hotel. However, once we reached the station, we found ourselves surrounded by numerous vagrants, and two of them began to follow us. We quickened our pace until we felt we had to run and hide inside a supermarket located within the train station.
Desperate for help, we asked the staff if someone could call a taxi for us; the atmosphere outside felt increasingly unsafe. Unfortunately, the staff members were unhelpful, some pretending not to understand our language. As someone whose mother tongue is Spanish—almost identical to Italian in many aspects—I found it perplexing that they claimed not to understand us, as if the similarities in the languages weren’t striking.
We eventually located a taxi station, and although my mom couldn’t stop complaining about the experience the driver understood every word of our frustration.
It had been a long, exhausting day. We managed to appreciate the views, but at what cost? For the first time in our travels, Rome made us feel utterly insecure, even with its stunning beauty and historical significance, it can also be a place of stark contradictions.
The city projects an image of grandeur in glossy travel photographs and brochures, yet it can swiftly crumble upon closer inspection. Yet, there’s more to add to my bucket list, and more lessons to learn.
In the end, it's a matter of either falling in love with the city or feeling a sense of disappointment. While we visited some impressive monuments, most failed to live up to our expectations, except for the striking monument to Victor Emmanuel II. Our stay in Rome left us yearning for the beauty and charm we envisioned but couldn't quite find.

At first this can be quite a grotesque and confronting place. In about 1631, the Capuchin monks used the bones of over 4000 dead monks, plus a few others, to decorate the walls and ceilings of the crypts.
However, if you look past the fact you are surrounded by death, you can see the messages the monks have incorporated into these series of small chapels. Each chapel has a different point to make to visitors, but all share the common theme that life is short, while death is for eternity. This is not meant to be morbid. The bones are arranged to create symbols, such as clocks to remind us to embrace life, to live life well and with meaning.
The story of how the order of Capuchin monks was established and how these crypts were created are fascinating. Capuchin means hoods in Italian and they are a branch off from the Franciscan order. Occasionally there are performances of sacred music in the crypts, usually at night which would be both powerful and slightly petrifying, despite the uplifting messages.
A tour is probably the best way to get the most out of this place as the untrained eye will miss a lot of the details and hidden metaphors. City Wonders is the original tour of this kind, reasonably priced and the tour guides really know their stuff, often university graduate students in the field.
This is Rome’s answer to Pompeii. It is close enough to Rome to visit in a day trip.
During ancient Roman times, this was a major seaport, a significant city to the Roman Empire (509BC — 27BC). However, other seaports sprang up and Ostia became neglected. When a malaria plague hit the city, people left in droves and it became forgotten for centuries. At its height 100,000 people called Ostia home and your can still walk down the main street and see the theatre, taverns, and public baths.
Ostia provides a window into ancient Roman life without having to go too far afield.
Just up the road from the Colosseum, St Clements Basilica is an eye-opening experience. The current basilica, completed in the 12th century, was built on the ruins of Rome’s past. Rome is a city of layers as each era builds on top of the last. This is good for archaeology as it preserves the past, but not so good for building new metro lines. Construction has been held up for years because every time they dig, they find yet another historically significant site and have to down tools, but I digress. St Clements Basilica provides a first-hand experience of what lays beneath the surface of Rome. The Basilica itself holds and interesting story about St Clement, but narrow, damp stairs lead you down through history to a 4th century church. But it doesn’t end there. Further down is 1st century Rome including a store room for the Colosseum, a surprisingly intact pagan temple, alleyways, baths, homes and the river that connects to the Colosseum is still running down there. These all date back to Nero’s fire. Truly a journey through the hidden depths of Rome.
Note: A church (chiesa) is different from a basilica. A basilica in a church that contains a sacred relic and therefore hold more religious significance. This basilica allegedly holds the martyred remains of Saint Clement and Saint Ignatius, which leads me neatly to the next point.
Like many churches in Rome, the exterior of St Ignatius looks quite bland and you’d be forgiven for walking past it without giving it a second thought. I did. Once I went inside and was amazed, I pledged never to judge an Italian church by it’s cover again.
The beauty and magnificence of the ceiling fresco is awesome. It depicts representations of the continents to symbolise the missionary work of the Jesuit order, a refreshing change from the usual sacred art subjects. For me it is better than the Sistine chapel. A big call I know, but the optical illusion created of people seemingly falling and infinite space in genius. Andrea Pozzo is the Jesuit painter and architect who you have probably never heard of who specialised in these illusions in the 17th century.
Pozzo also created a false dome win St Ignatius, another optical illusion of great magnitude.
St Ignatius Church is just around the corner from the Pantheon. Entry is free.
While we’re on the subject of under rated artists: Bernini. So often he is overlooked, but without him Rome would be far less beautiful, or interesting. Rather than go one about it, here are some picture of his work. They speak for themselves.
6. Dawn
Dawn is the best time to appreciate Bernini’s masterpieces and the eternal city itself. It’s also a great time to take memorable photos, without random tourists and hawkers getting in the way. At this time there’s a serenity to the eternal city that is lost when battling the hoards.
7. Appian Way
When you ask: What have the Romans ever done for us? One of the first answers is the roads. Goes without saying. The Appian way is one of the first and most important roads the ancient Romans built, and the original paved path is still intact.
But even if you’re not mad keen on soaking up the beauty of ancient roadways, the Appian Way is another site to enjoy some distance from the crowds. It also provides a host of interesting attractions as well as a deliciously sinister history. Since it was prohibited to bury people within the city walls, the early Christians and Jews buried their loved ones in catacombs beneath the Appian Way. More infamously, Spartacus and his legion of slave followers were crucified along the road sides following their unsuccessful uprising to serve as a warning to other would-be upstarts.
If you’ve got the time or inclination you may want to walk the entire 62 KM length (originally it was more than 200 KM long), but you certainly don’t have to. Indeed, you don’t even have to walk. There are bike tours, and even Segway tours available.
I would rarely suggest a tour, but this one is different. It’s a 90-minute, small group night time walking tour that takes you to the sites of some dastardly happenings in the city. The cases selected for the tour tended to be more domestic nature, rather than political, so no Julius Caesar murder or incestuous Caligula. But there was one case involving a sinister pope. One doesn’t want to give too much away. The walk was easy, and the tour ends near a taxi rank. It’s also one of the cheapest tours on offer. Check out the tour and tickets here. Would recommend doing the tour before visiting the Castel St. Angelo.
Julius Cesar was famously stabbed in the back by his senators, including his best mate. It all went down in Pompey’s Theatre — not to be confused with Pompeii of volcano infamy.
Pompey’s Theatre is in the city of Rome. It is currently the site of a cat sanctuary where the city’s stray cats are fed, de-sexed, given medical treatment and re-homed. The cats live among the ruins of the theatre. It’s a great place for cat lovers. Be quick though as there are plans to re-purpose the site as a tourist attraction with new toilets and gift shop.
If you’re not a big fan of opera, but would like to experience some high Italian culture, then check out I Virtuosi Dell Opéra di Roma.
A collection of well-loved opera arias are performed in the Church of St. Paolo Entrole Le Mura and is far less formal than a full-blown operatic experience and at 22 Euro, much cheaper. The company has been around for a good 20 years. Musicians and singers are first rate and the acoustics in the church are phenomenal. But the company also offers other options of varying degrees of formality here.
Of course, there are far more fascinating and unusual things Rome has to offer. A city doesn’t get to be eternal without an eternity of captivating interest points. Just wandering about getting lost in the lanes and discovering hidden gems is a wonderful way to spend a few hours.
There are many tours available in Rome, but I recommend City Wonders because they are reasonably priced, the guides are experts in their fields and the content of the tours take you to next level, not just same-old tourism info.
For more nomadic tales and experiments come see me at Coolfooting where life is a journey not a race.

“Me, I have simpler tastes. I like to kill my enemies, take their gold and enjoy their women.” — roguish Titus Pullo
The first battle scene in the Rome TV series, which stunningly comes across like a movie, sets the tone of a rocky but true buddy relationship between two career Roman soldiers — the charming anti-hero Titus Pullo (played by Ray Stevenson) and his officious pal Lucius Vorenus (Kevin McKidd). By-the-book centurion Vorenus excoriates rabble-rouser legionary Pullo to “get back in formation you drunken fool” during the battle with the Gauls.
The Romans win the battle but Pullo is flogged for his insubordination, even though he single-handedly took down several Gallic warriors. After he gets his due punishment, Pullo, who knows how to drink, brawl, kill a lot of enemy combatants, and make love, continues to show his anti-heroic ways, chiding his torturers:
“Is that it? I was just beginning to enjoy myself…”
During the two seasons and 22 episodes of Rome, there were many more “Pullo-isms” — wisecracking, but sometimes surprisingly insightful quips by the brutal but lovably giant character that he was.
“Juno’s a c•nt, but you’re salty! And I was worried about bringing you!” Pullo to young Octavian, emperor to be
Englishman Stevenson and his onscreen creation Pullo were larger-than-life-characters. Pullo was described as a “devil-may-care soldier with the morals of a pirate, the appetites of a hedonist…”
When visiting Hollywood, where I live, actor Stevenson once told me: “Playing Pullo on Rome turned my life around. It got me agent representation in the States and effectively started my movie career, which led to my lead roles in the Punisher franchise, and another feature movie, Kill the Irishman, and much more. So much happened because of that portrayal of Pullo in Rome.”
Octavian: “We’ve given you up for dead.” Pullo: “Nah. One of these days maybe. But not yet.”
But Pullo the character survived the series and essentially outlasted the man who portrayed him. Stevenson was filming Star Wars: Ahsoka in Italy in 2023 when he suddenly and sadly passed away.
“I’ve never actually tortured anyone. I don’t know how… They have specialists!” — Pullo to Octavian
I knew Ray personally, as a journalist who hung out with him several times, met his family, and sipped scotch malt whisky with Ray, while interviewing him for Playboy and other magazines.
Once, I and entertainment lawyer Angela Jackson also listened to him play surprisingly well on his Dobro guitar in his hotel room off LA’s famous Sunset Strip — while sipping several glasses of The Macallan in some fine crystal. He told us of sipping scotch at The Scotch Malt Whisky Society in London. Oh, to be a fly on the wall there.
“Calm down, love. It’s not for me, it’s the young master we’re here for.” — Pullo to madam on taking Octavian to a brothel
Ray and I had an idea of writing up a book on the best Pullo-isms, and explaining the context. He immediately warmed to the idea, rhyming off some of his favorite sayings by Pullo.
“No one’s a traitor until they are.”
“Forculus, if you be the right god for the business here, I call on you to help me. If you will open this door, then I will kill for you a fine white lamb, or, failing that, if I couldn’t get a good one at a decent price, then six pigeons.”
Vorenus: “You… talk too much.” Pullo: “We all have our faults.”
Indeed, Stevenson said getting into the shoes of Pullo, helped him become the actor and person he was to become: “As an actor, playing Pullo, I feel I learned to get out of my own way in that series. I stopped having a stupid projected view about if I did this then maybe I could then know this or that thing about actors. It really made me sit down in my own skin and just turn up and do the job — the job’s enough.”
When we got to the impact of playing Pullo on his personal life, he added, “That period, shooting Rome mostly at the Cinecittà studios, was one of the major periods in my personal life, as well. I basically found my partner who was my landlady. And, that led to us having three boys together.”
The final scene of the second season of Rome, which set up the possibility of a third season which unfortunately never came off, involves Octavian with the returning Pullo, who “fibs” a little telling Octavian that young Caesarion is dead. Octavian is on his way to ascending as Caesar Augustus, Rome’s first emperor.
When Pullo leaves Octavian’s palace, he meets up with the still-quite-alive Caesarion, the son of Cleopatra and supposedly Julius Caesar. The young lad swears vengeance, saying, “By my blood, I’ll not rest until I have avenged my mother and redeemed my father’s name.”
Stevenson and I couldn’t help but crack up when we recalled that final scene with Pullo and Caesarion, and the final Pullo-ism of the series, a final line of dialog that encapsulates the mischief that underscored Stevenson’s portrayal of Pullo. The underlying context in this somewhat fictionalized version of the historical story, is that Pullo had done his soldier’s duty by “getting it on” with Cleopatra and afterwards exclaiming in his inimitable fashion: “That Gyppo princess, now that’s good c•nny.”
So, immediately after Caesarion’s little boy vow to avenge his mother, Pullo plainly but mischievously responds:
“Listen, about your father…” — Pullo to Caesarion
Rome debuted in summer of 2005, the first series on which HBO and the BBC worked together as co-producers. So, next year in 2025 would be the 20-year anniversary of Rome the series. For fans of the show and of Ray Stevenson (RIP, sir knight), wouldn’t it be a fine bow to have some celebration and/or memorial for both next year? So, let’s do something…
Check out the first and final scenes of “Rome” on YouTube. And, also drop in on Ray Stevenson’s IMDb Pro page with contacts.

Rome is one of the most history-rich cities in the world. It was our third stop on our whirlwind trip through Italy with my friend Melissa, who has been visiting from Texas. This was Eric’s and my fourth trip to Rome and we still saw things we’d not encountered before.
I’m going to take a different slant in this article. Everyone talks about the same “what you must see” things: the colosseum, Trevi fountain, the Roman Forum, Palatine Hill, the Pantheon, St. Peter’s Basilica, the Vatican Museum and Sistine Chapel, Piazza Navona, the Spanish Steps, and the Castel Sant’Angelo. Rather than do the same old/same old descriptions, however, here are some unique facts about three of the historic structures in this amazing city.
The most famous structure in Rome, and probably one of the most famous in the world, is the Flavian Amphitheater, better known as the Roman Coliseum. It’s the largest ancient amphitheater ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheater in the world today. Since 2007 it’s considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World.
The Colosseum was commissioned around 70–72 CE by Emperor Vespasian of the Flavian dynasty as a gift to the Roman people. In 80 CE, Vespasian’s son Titus opened the Colosseum–officially known as the Flavian Amphitheater–with 100 days of games.
Each sector (level) was reserved for a specific class of citizens, based on their importance. However, the entrance was free for anybody. It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history, having an average audience of some 65,000. The structure was so well designed and organized all of its audience could exit the structure in less than 15 minutes.
The Colosseum was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock sea battles. Nude synchronized swimmers sometimes performed by moonlight.
Usually the daily program was the following:
Once upon a time, the Colosseum featured a velarium (curtain) which was a type of awning. Retractable awnings were relatively common throughout the Roman Empire. Their unique design created a ventilation updraft, providing circulation and a cool breeze. The velarium stretched over the whole of the cavea, the seating area in the Colosseum, to protect spectators from the sun. Precisely how the awning was supported is a matter of conjecture.
The velarium that covered the Colosseum was the biggest that had ever been constructed. It’s believed that sailors from the Misenum fleet, with their background in sailmaking and rigging were employed to build, maintain and operate the velarium.
The colosseum remained almost intact until the 6th century, although t was damaged by earthquakes in 847 and 1231 (and subsequently repaired).
But after four centuries of active use, the fall of the Roman Empire brought an end to regular activities. The magnificent arena was abandoned and fell into neglect. It was repurposed many times, including being used for housing and shops, a church (that used the stage for a cemetery), a fortress for the Frangipani clan, and finally a monastery.
Unfortunately, until the 18th century, it was also used as a source of building materials. Marble cladding, seats, statues, support structures, and more were removed and used for other buildings around Rome, including a few larger projects by the Vatican. Two-thirds of the original Colosseum was destroyed through this “legal pillaging”.
Damage continued during the Middle Ages, when holes were drilled into the side during the Middle Ages in an attempt to locate the metal support structure.
The original floor of the Colosseum is long gone, exposing the hypogeum, the Colosseum’s substructure of underground passages, cages, and rooms where prisoners, animals, and gladiators were kept. The complex underground system’s hatches, hoists, and mobile types of machinery, allowed men, wild animals, and props to be brought up to the arena floor.
A partial floor has been constructed and is used as a stage for occasional concerts and performances.
Outside the Colosseum near the Arch of Constantine you can still see the remains of little shops which sold food, drinks, and souvenirs for the spectators, much like our professional sport arenas today. (They’re on the right in this picture.)
In 2013, a massive restoration and preservation project began. The last of it was still continuing when we visited, and some sections of the interior only opened the week after we left.
Today, the Roman Colosseum is the symbol of Rome in the world. It’s become a historical and archaeological treasure able to remind us of the greatness of the Roman Empire.
The city of Rome has big plans for the upcoming years of the Colosseum— including a retractable floor that will act as a stage for performances and shows. The arena will return to its original purpose: a space where visitors can attend concerts, theater performances, and more, just like it did nearly 2,000 years ago when it was first built (except without the human and animal deaths). Current completion is scheduled for 2023.
According to a calculation made by the Ministry of Culture, Flavio Amphitheater receives over 7 million visitors a year and ranks first among the most visited monuments in Italy. In 2018, TripAdvisor wrote that the Roman Colosseum was the most popular tourist attraction in the entire world.
Thanks to the above numbers, the Colosseum can get a bit crowded. We were lucky it was drizzly and overcast, not to mention off-season, so crowds were down. It’s absolutely worth seeing, but if you can go off-season, do it.
The largest fountain in Rome is the beautiful, baroque Trevi Fountain, featuring Neptune, the god of the sea, on his chariot. Construction of the fountain began in 1732 under the direction of Nicolo Salvi and was completed in 1762 by Pannini.
Rome has over 2000 fountains (more than any other city in the world). There are 50 monumental fountains, of which the Trevi is the most famous. There are also hundreds of smaller fountains and thousands of nasoni (big noses), which still supply citizens and tourists with free drinking water.
The fountain is located at the junction of three roads, which is actually how it got its name (the Latin name derives from the word trivium (tre vie — an intersection of three streets). It is literally the Three Street Fountain.
The fountain is located at the end point of what was the Aqua Virgo (Virgin Waters) Aqueduct, constructed in around 19 BCE. It was one of the eleven Roman aqueducts that supplied the city of ancient Rome. Legend says that with the help of a virgin, Roman technicians located a source of pure water some 13 km (8.1 miles) from the city. This scene is presented on the fountain’s façade.
The Trevi Fountain has been featured in many movies and TV shows, including: Roman Holiday (1953), Three Coins in the Fountain (1954), Federico Fellini’s classic La Dolce Vita (1960), Sabrina Goes to Rome (1998), and The Lizzie McGuire Movie (2003).
There’s a legend, inspired by the movie Three Coins in the Fountain, about throwing in three coins: the first guarantees a repeat visit to the city, the second means a love affair, and the third means a wedding. Yes, I did it, but only threw in one coin. I don’t need a love affair or a wedding, as I’m happily married for 30+ years. But I’d definitely like to return to Rome!
Over €2,000,000 worth of coins are thrown in by hopeful tourists every year. That money is regularly collected and used to support a food bank/social supermarket for people living in poverty in Rome.
The Trevi Fountain was once one of the most important sources for distributing fresh water to the public baths and drinking fountains across the city. Today the fountain is recirculated, to the tune of 2,823,800 cubic feet of water every 24 hours. It’s one of the few fountains that are non-potable (not safe to drink from).
The day we visited with Melissa was moderately crowded. The sun was out and air was warm, even though it was late March. We also went on a Sunday, so there were many locals enjoying the area. When you get a chance to go, pick a weekday, and go off-season. This picture IS off season, so if you go in the peak of summer, expect much denser crowds than this.
A bit less well-known, but equally spectacular, is the Roman Pantheon, the most preserved and influential building of ancient Rome. The name pantheon means “temple of all the gods” so it’s believed the Pantheon was originally dedicated to all the gods of pagan Rome.
It’s nearly as popular as the Roman Colosseum, with 7 million annual visitors. And unlike the Colosseum, the Pantheon is free to visit during the week.
It’s location wasn’t chosen by chance. According to legend, it’s the place where the founder of Rome, Romulus, at his death was seized by an eagle and taken off into the skies with the Gods.
The current Pantheon isn’t the original. It’s actually the third built on the same site. The first was built by Marcus Agrippa in 27 BCE. It burned down in 80 CE and was reconstructed by Emperor Domition. This second one was struck by lightning in 110 CE and burned down again. It was rebuilt the second time by Emperor Trajan, although he died before completion. The building was completed by Hadrian between 118–128 CE and remains to this day, having survived almost 2000 years. One problem with tracking Hadrian’s construction is that he reused the original inscription (from 27 BC) attributing the building to Agrippa.
The building is a rotunda (cylindrical in shape) with a portico of large granite Corinthian columns (eight in the first rank and two groups of four behind) under a pediment (the triangle gable). A rectangular vestibule links the porch to the rotunda. In the top of the dome is an oculus (central opening) to the sky. Almost two thousand years after it was built, the Pantheon’s dome is still the world’s largest unreinforced concrete dome.
The building precisely follows the rules of Classical architecture laid out by Vitruvius, creating an aesthetically pleasing form. The height of the building is exactly the same as the diameter, meaning that a perfect sphere would fit inside. This gives the Pantheon the impression of perfect balance and harmony.
The large circular domed cella (inner chamber of an ancient Greek or Roman temple), with a conventional temple portico front, was unique in Roman architecture. Nevertheless, it became one of the most imitated buildings in history. For example, the library Thomas Jefferson designed for the University of Virginia is based on the Pantheon. Michelangelo said it was the work of angels, not men.
The Pantheon wasn’t just built as a pagan temple dedicated to all the gods. In fact, it was the first temple built for the common people. That’s common for temples and churches today, but in ancient times temples were forbidden places, only for vestals and priests.
Had it stayed a pagan temple, it might have fallen into ruin like so many other ancient Roman buildings. But in the year 608, Emperor Phocas gave the temple to Pope Boniface IV as a gift. The Pope had all remnants of paganism removed and consecrated it as the church of St Mary and the Martyrs.
The building’s consecration as a church saved it from the abandonment, destruction, and the worst of the pillaging that the majority of ancient Rome’s buildings suffered during the early medieval period. It’s the reason the Pantheon is one of the best-preserved of all Ancient Roman buildings.
One of the Pantheon’s greatest elements is its 43.2 meter (142 foot) dome. It was the largest dome in the world for more than 1300 years until Brunelleschi, inspired by the Pantheon, built his famous Duomo in Florence. It’s still the largest unreinforced concrete dome in the world.
The dome was built with a single casting of concrete in subsequent layers. The concrete was lightened by mixing it with lighter stones as it neared the highest point, as well as gradually making the wall thinner. In lower levels, the concrete was mixed with heavy travertine stone. As the dome grew, progressively lighter materials (such as tuffo stone) were used. The top layer was made with pumice, a light-weight stone.
Plus, the coffers (sunken squares) in the ceiling also help to minimize the weight.
The dome was originally covered in bronze, which must have been a glorious sight in the sun. Unfortunately, throughout the Middle Ages, materials were gradually stripped away to be used elsewhere. Pope Urban VIII (a member of the Barberini family) took the bronze from the Pantheon’s portico in 1631 to construct cannons for the Vatican, giving rise to the saying quod non fecerunt barbari, fecerunt Barberini’(what the barbarians didn’t do was done by the Barberini).
At the centre of the dome, there is a 9 meter (30 foot) diameter hole, called the Oculus. Looking up, you’d never guess the hole is that big. It’s the only light source inside, and yes, water does get inside when it rains.
We walked an average of 17,000 steps every day we were in Rome, so we obviously saw much more than the above. I’ll add a few additional photos in closing, but am not going to go into detail about the locations (“minutes to read” matters).
I would very much like your thoughts on the style of my last couple of articles. Most writers do a travelogue/commentary style, describing their walk around a location, and including brief descriptions of everything they see. Instead, I’ve chosen to follow my former life as a technical writer, by giving facts, history, details, and trivia about a few select locations. Please let me know if you like this style or would rather read a more traditional travelogue.
More of our favorite stops in Rome:
And, of course…

The city of Rome, with its rich tapestry of history and legend, stands as a testament to the complexities of human civilization. Its origins, shrouded in the mists of time, are a blend of myth and historical fact, a confluence that has fascinated scholars, historians, and enthusiasts for centuries. This article delves into the depths of Rome’s founding, exploring the interplay of myth and history, and unraveling the threads of truth that lie within the legendary tale of Romulus and Remus.
At the heart of Rome’s foundation story is the legend of Romulus and Remus, twin brothers said to be the sons of Mars, the god of war, and Rhea Silvia, a Vestal Virgin. According to the myth, they were abandoned as infants and left to die in the Tiber River. However, fate intervened, and they were discovered and suckled by a she-wolf, an image that has become emblematic of Rome itself. The twins were later found and raised by a shepherd and his wife. As young men, Romulus and Remus became involved in a dispute over the rightful ruler of Alba Longa, their ancestral home. This conflict led them to leave and establish their own city. However, disagreement arose between the brothers over the location and governance of the new city. This dispute culminated in Romulus killing Remus, either in a fit of rage or as a consequence of Remus mocking his brother’s efforts to build a city wall. Romulus then became the sole founder and the first king of the new city, which he named Rome.

While the tale of Romulus and Remus is rich in symbolic and cultural significance, historical evidence paints a different picture of Rome’s origins. Historians generally agree that the city was founded in the 8th century BCE, though the exact date remains a topic of debate. The traditional date of Rome’s founding, as calculated by the Roman historian Varro, is 753 BCE, but archaeological evidence suggests that the area was inhabited earlier. The early Romans were likely a mix of Latin and Sabine peoples, indigenous tribes of the Italian peninsula. These groups settled on the seven hills that would later become central to Roman mythology and city planning. The location of Rome, near the Tiber River and at a crossroads of trade and migration routes, was strategic for commerce and defense, suggesting that the city’s origins were as much about practicality as they were about destiny.

The story of Romulus and Remus serves as a powerful founding myth, providing Rome with a narrative of divine origin and heroic founding. Myths like these often arise in ancient cultures to explain the unexplainable and to offer a sense of identity and purpose. In the case of Rome, the myth of its divine founding by the sons of Mars lent the city and its people an aura of destiny and greatness. However, the line between myth and history is not always clear. Historical events often become embellished with mythical elements, and myths may contain kernels of historical truth. The legend of Romulus and Remus, for instance, might be seen as a symbolic representation of the struggles and conflicts inherent in the founding of any city or civilization. The fratricidal conflict between the brothers could reflect the real-life conflicts between different tribes or social groups in early Rome.

Archaeological excavations in Rome and its surrounding areas have provided valuable insights into the city’s early history. Discoveries such as the remains of early settlements on the Palatine Hill, pottery, and burial sites have shed light on the lives of Rome’s earliest inhabitants. These findings suggest a gradual development of the city from a collection of small villages to a more organized urban center. One of the most significant discoveries is the Lapis Niger, an ancient shrine in the Roman Forum. Inscriptions found at the site date back to the 6th century BCE and reference a king, possibly linking to the period of the Roman Kingdom. While not directly confirming the existence of Romulus, these findings support the idea of a monarchical system in early Rome, as the legend suggests.

The influence of Greek culture on Roman mythology and history is undeniable. Many of the myths, including the story of Romulus and Remus, show parallels with Greek mythology. This cultural crossover is likely due to the close interactions between Greek colonies in southern Italy and the early Romans. The Romans were known to have adopted and adapted various elements of Greek culture, including art, religion, and literature. The adaptation of Greek myths and legends into Roman culture served not only to enrich Roman mythology but also to establish Rome as a continuation and successor of the great Greek civilization. This cultural appropriation helped Rome to build its own identity, borrowing from the prestige and legacy of the Greeks.

The legend of Romulus and Remus has had a lasting impact on Roman culture and identity. The image of the she-wolf nursing the twin brothers is a symbol of Rome that persists to this day. This iconography has been found on various artifacts, including coins, sculptures, and paintings, throughout the history of Rome. The story of the city’s founding by divine descendants also served to legitimize the rule of its leaders. Emperors and politicians often traced their lineage back to divine or heroic ancestors, using these connections to justify their authority and policies. The myth of Romulus and Remus thus became a tool for political propaganda as well as a foundational narrative.

The founding of Rome, a blend of myth and history, continues to captivate the imagination of people around the world. The story of Romulus and Remus, whether viewed as literal truth, symbolic narrative, or a combination of both, is central to understanding the ethos and identity of ancient Rome. It speaks to the human need for stories that give meaning to our past and shape our collective identity. As we explore the origins of this great city, we are reminded of the power of myths in shaping history and the importance of historical research in understanding our myths. The story of Rome’s founding, in all its complexity, is a testament to the enduring legacy of one of the world’s greatest civilizations, a legacy that continues to influence us to this day.

An Ancient Roman aristocrat would surely feel proud that 2,000 years later, Rome still looms large in the Western consciousness as the greatest empire that ever was. Careers have been built on studying why Rome fell, and even the general public has heard some of the proposals: was it immigration, horse-back barbarians, Christianity, inflation, dependency on slaves, the decadence of the elites, or perhaps even lead poisoning?
We care about this mostly because we see Ancient Rome as a mirror of modern empires, especially the US. If Rome fell because of barbarian hordes, then surely that means America must kick out all the Mexicans or else it will suffer the same fate! … Right?
Today, I will be putting my ancient history degree to use by writing not about why Rome fell, but about the even more thorny topic of when it fell (if we can even pinpoint a date). You learn very different lessons about its decline depending on whether you feel that Rome fell in 330 AD, 395 AD, 476 AD, 565 AD, 1453 AD, 27 BC or even 105 BC. Which of these was the “real” date has a lot to do with how you define “Roman-ness” — a tougher topic than it seems.

After experiencing my Venetian Dream and enjoying the sunsets of Florence, all roads lead me to Rome. And here I am…
Yet, it seemed Rome wasn’t so happy to see me. I went to the hotel and found out this wasn’t my hotel. Seems like there are 4 hotels with the same names or similar, and my map showed me the most-rated one. So I booked a hotel just by checking its name on the map without double checking the address and… My hotel is somewhere else… OK, not funny, but first, let’s find it.
It wasn’t super easy, but I like challenges. I found the hotel, and checked in, and I didn’t have the energy to go on. Usually, I book a hotel near the sites I want to visit. This helps me not to waste time and energy on transportation. Now my hotel isn’t in the place I thought and… In one word—stressful.
Okay! I just had a little rest and went out very hungry. I decided to eat carbonara and went to the nearest restaurant to my hotel. The pasta was very salty. Okay, Rome doesn’t like me.
Still tired and stressed, disappointed with Rome, I started walking, and in about 15 minutes I appeared near the Colosseum. Seems like my hotel wasn’t so far away. Maybe everything isn’t so bad, haha…
Colosseum — the first World Wonder my eyes saw!
It’s huge and impressive. I was walking around and going back through history. This is the largest amphitheater ever built, and it is still standing, despite its age. This is a great achievement in ancient architecture. Really significant… but I’ll speak more later, as this was just the first meeting and I was going to see this wonder every day.
Rome is rich with fountains. You can see these water sources in every square. For instance, another beautiful fountain is located in the Piazza Navona—the Fiumi Fountains. Yet, the pearl of the Roman fountains remains Trevi Fountains. I walked there and understood that this fountain was meant to become one of my favorite spots in Rome.
Trevi fountains are huge and significant. And, of course, overcrowded. I loved it a lot—the architecture and especially its symbolism.
It was built as a water source for the city and constructed in travertine stone—the same material as the Colosseum. The magnificent view and stone decorations we see today were done in the late 18th century, commissioned by Pope Clement XII, who wanted to showcase the power and influence of the Catholic Church in Rome.
You may know that people throw coins into the water. The first and most well-known reason is based on local lore: it will bring you back to Rome again someday. Yet, some people do it hoping to find love or romance while in Rome and to marry there happily. And they say that each wish requires its own coin. As for me, I just enjoyed the magnificence of the fountains.
Rome is Rome, and there’s anything to see, whatever corner you step into. I was just walking around and appearing in another beautiful and historical place to enjoy. Piazza Navona was one of them—a nice square where you may just have a break, sit on a bench, and enjoy the weather, and how Roman people live their daily lives, how tourists react, and so on—lots of emotions and feelings.
The Spanish Steps is another favorite site in Rome. The view from the top is very beautiful, and walking up is another way to discover the lifestyle in Rome. It all began when the French wanted to create a symbolic connection between France and Spain in Rome. Spanish Steps was given to the world to connect Trinità dei Monti church, owned by the French, to the Piazza di Spagna, named for the Bourbon Spanish Embassy that stood alongside it.
Quirinal Palace is another square and another historical building in Rome. This is the home of the president of Italy. They say that it is possible to have a guided tour of this building in Italian language. So, if you’re interested in where the Italian president lives and you’re okay with the Italian language, book a tour.
The next square you may easily appear in is the Piazza del Popolo. Here you will see the Twin Churches and fountains. I loved the idea of having such churches.
And if you walk up, you’ll appear at a viewpoint from which you can see the square and a beautiful view of the city as well. It is worth waiting for a sunset there.
Of course, I couldn’t be in Rome and not find an Armenian site. This time it was San Biagio degli Armeni—the national church of the Armenian community in Rome. The church is frequently recorded in medieval catalogs. It originated before the 10th century but was first recorded in a 1072 inscription preserved inside it.
I read that there’s Armenian liturgy on some days of the week. Unfortunately, when I went, there was a nun who was praying, and I didn’t want to disturb her. I would like to talk to somebody and try to learn more about this Armenian piece, but it wasn’t meant to be.
I met the Colosseum every morning and evening, but of course, I couldn’t miss my chance to enter this masterpiece and see the ancient history, architecture, and culture. I had booked a tour in advance, and it was one of the best things I did. First of all, let me tell you, the guides are very enthusiastic and funny, and they help you understand everything better. My tour started with the Roman Forum.
I learned a lot about Roman history when I visited the Roman Forum, surrounded by the ruins of several important ancient government buildings at the center of Rome. Here you may see even a few columns of an early building, and it’s so lovely how Italians preserve their history and ancient heritage.
These days, the Forum is part of the Parco Archeologico del Colosseo.
After exploring the Forum, my group was guided to the Colosseum. This amphitheater has three levels of arches around the outside. In height, the Colosseum was as tall as a modern 12-story building; it held 50,000 spectators.
When I entered, I saw that the walls were darker from the inside. They say that in ancient times, when there weren’t lights, people had to use torches when going inside, even during the day. This ancient giant is even greater from the inside. It was a very interesting experience to see the arena floor and imagine gladiators fighting.
When looking closer at the walls, you can see that the building has many holes that resemble Swiss cheese. The guide explained that the massive travertine blocks that make up the outer wall were not stuck together with mortar or cement, as you might expect. Instead, they used iron clamps. And after successive Barbarian invasions, iron had become very valuable. The Romans gouged out the plaster covering the iron, pulled it out, and used it for various purposes (mostly weaponry). I read somewhere that it is estimated that over 300 tons of iron were removed from the building, leaving it pockmarked as it is today.
In any case, Romans know how to preserve their history and historical heritage. There was even a few meters of the ancient floor outside the Colosseum that they enclosed so that people don’t walk on it.
I’ve always used to say that my eyes are blessed to see this world and its wonders. But in Rome, it became even more practical.
As the Colosseum was the nearest spot to my hotel, every morning I was passing by it. It was probably my second morning there when Viktor Hladchenko approached me and asked to take a photo of my eye reflecting the Colosseum. I leave it to your judgment.
Don’t you think I’m lucky? I do.
I forgot to tell you that wherever I was walking in Rome, the dome of Saint Peter Basilica was visible.
And finally, that day came when I visited the Vatican—the smallest country in the world. This isn’t a joke; imagine that this small territory is a separate country inside the city of Rome. It has everything: a passport system, license plates, a post office, a flag, a telephone system, and a radio station. The Pope himself heads the state, and every year, over 6 million tourists visit Vatican Museums.
This small country has great significance in the Christian world. And being an Armenian (the first nation that adopted Christianity as a state religion in 301), as well as being a museum lover, I was waiting for this day. Unfortunately, I wasn’t lucky enough to see the Pope… haha…
I spent 5 hours wandering in the Vatican Museum, Sistine Chapel, and Saint Peter’s Basilica. And I was impressed. However, the most significant for me was the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Here, I understood why it isn’t allowed to take photos there. No photo may express what my eyes saw, even a little similar to that. The ceiling is live, and all the figures and creatures are real, and sometimes it even seems they’re moving… This is a real masterpiece, and it is worth spending hours looking up at the ceilings, even if your neck already kills.
I also had a chance to see the dome of Saint Peter’s Basilica from one of the best possible angles, where the windows and the dome are wholly visible. It’s not possible to see it from the front side.
The inside of the church is impressive as well. It’s really huge, especially for me, as I am used to small Armenian churches with humble church architecture without so many colors. Imagine how tired I would be after walking so long and getting so much information and emotion. And that wasn’t enough. I went out of the basilica and looked up instinctively (because you need to look up in order not to miss), and you guess what?
In front of me on the wall of Saint Peter’s Basilica, there was a statue of St. Gregory the Illuminator—the Armenian Saint, thanks to whom Armenians adopted Christianity.
I saw the Armenian letters and thought I was so tired I had an illusion. But no, it was real, and you can see it when you visit the basilica.
After a tiring and informative day in Vatican City, I was very tired and tasty. So, I decided to walk to the Trastevere neighborhood to eat something. This part of Rome is well-known for its bars and restaurants. There is an interesting atmosphere and, of course, tasty dishes.
Trastevere is colorful, with many people sitting inside and outside restaurants, enjoying their Roman experience. I like this neighborhood and recommend going there even if you don’t want to eat; just enjoy the narrow streets, color, and atmosphere.
As I’ve already mentioned, I tried a salty Carbonara during my first day in Rome. But I never give up. I gave another chance to this pasta, which originated in Rome. I tried it once more in another restaurant (unfortunately, I don’t remember the name), and it was super delicious. I loved Romanian Carbonara.
In Trastevere, I tried another pasta originating in Rome—Cacio e Pepe (Spaghetti with Cheese and Pepper). This is a simple but very delicious pasta to try when you are in Rome. It was great.
To make the long story short, I loved Italian pasta.
I spent 4 full days in Rome and I think that’s enough to explore the city for your first visit.
I went to the hotel in the evening (by the way, as my hotel wasn’t in a walking area from everywhere I was going, I used buses to go back to the hotel). Of course, after enjoying the best tiramisu in my life and with the best view. I couldn’t leave Rome without saying “See you soon” to the Trevi fountains. Btw, do not miss this spot at night as well.
OK! Let’s come back. My flight was early in the morning (about 6 AM), and I had to arrive at the airport at night. Somehow scary, isn’t it? Okay, it wasn’t until it became.
No buses, no trains; I only have one option—a taxi. A friend told me I could use Uber. I tried earlier, and it showed some cars nearby, but when the time came and I tried to request a ride, it didn’t work. Okay, it was about 2 AM; I needed to go to the airport, and I didn’t know how. Then it was scary.
I went out of the hotel, walked for about 10 minutes, and saw some people. At first, I was scared to approach them, but I realized I didn’t have another chance. So, I asked them for help. Fortunately, they were very kind and willing to help me. It wasn’t easy to find a taxi for them as well. They called some services, tried some applications, and managed to find one for me. I’m so thankful to these people. If you read me, guys, write to me. I’ll be happy to help you whenever you’re in Armenia.
I love Rome!
I love people in Rome. I love the Italian way of enjoying life. And I love the idea of living in Rome for a few months. For me, Rome is a middle-aged man who is smart inside and who also cares about his look and appearance. He’s well-trained and wearing a classic outfit—a dark blue suit and white shirt with a tie, probably. And maybe he is riding a motorcycle.
Of the 3 Italian cities I lived in, I go for Rome. Okay, Venice is unique and special—a real dream of magic; Florence is cozy and cultural—with breathtaking views; but Rome is Rome—ancient but aesthetic, historical but fictional, architectural, sweet, and lovely. I loved the vibe in Rome. Rome is closer to my soul. It’s like me—romantic and real!
I love Italy 🖤

By now, all my friends know how obsessed with Ancient Roman history I am — if the Hadrian necklace around my neck wasn’t a major indicator, my Facebook wall is covered in memes about Julius Caesar’s stabbing and the gayness of Ancient Greeks. I don’t see how everyone isn’t googly-eyed about Trajan’s conquests in Dacia or the way Romans engineered their Forum.
But as my sister so eloquently said in Barnes&Noble, as I was crouched down at the ancient history section, “It’s just a bunch of dead guys.” Incorrect! The Gallic Wars by Julius Caesar, Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, and the speeches and private letters of Cicero create a breathing, amorphous view of Ancient Rome as the Romans lived it. They’re crumbling now, but it’s so easy to get into Rome when you hear them speaking to you. Here are a few ways to submerse yourself in Ancient culture without wasting money on classes or feeling like an anachronistic nitwit — because the Ancient do matter, and they were pretty wild.
Although a painfully in-depth history of Rome isn’t necessary, it does make understanding memes easier and dropping highfalutin facts at parties a treat. After I visited Rome for the first time, I flocked to the internet, looking for anything to teach me ancient history. I stumbled on this podcast, The History of Rome by Mike Duncan, which was a five-year project detailing the early years of the Roman kingdoms to its ignominious fall in 476 CE. 189 episodes of wry humor, encyclopedic facts, and anecdotes testifying to the gore of Rome, the series is thick but enjoyable. 14-year-old Mackenzie lived for this podcast, scrawling little notes in a dark bedroom (this is only half exaggeration). Although this fascination only heightened my social ineptness, I learned so much (too much) about dead guys.
2. Join the Ancient Roman Meme Pages
Browse a few Facebook meme pages, and you’ll have working knowledge of the big kahunas of ancient history. My top two pages are Roman SPQRposting and Rough Roman Memes — the former is crass and attaches names like Julius Caesar and Seneca to PornHub screenshots, but it’s so hilarious. My social media walls are a running joke, with all my friends knowing me as the Ancient Meme girl. But beyond the porn and Elon Musk memes, history is explained and jabbed at. It forces users to research memes they don’t understand (i.e. What happened at the Teutoburg Forest? What does the two walls of The Battle of Alesia mean?) This subculture of meme trolls is highly educated and highly derisive, with people posting revisions to already revised memes in the comments. Also, I just saw someone post 50 shades of Alcibiades, and I am done.
3. Brush Up on Ancient Roman TV and Movie Adaptations
Russell Crowe isn’t the apex of Roman history, but at least his attractiveness seduces people into the ancient history genre. Netflix has 5+ smarmy shows about Rome, although the HBO ROME series is the most salacious and salient of them all. And we can’t forget I, Claudius, that 1970s BBC show that was weirdly great despite the multiple incest and boob scenes. It’s important to take these shows with a granary of salt (get it?). While they are dramatic and make everything seem neatly cut and sequential, Ancient Rome wasn’t easy to follow — communication between armies took weeks or months and it’s easy to focus on megalomaniacal Emperors instead of the reams of “normal” Roman citizens.
As for movie adaptations, I would watch the 70s/80s movies that are as cringy as they are wholesome. Ben Hur, Quo Vadis, and Monty Python’s Life of Brian aren’t 100% accurate, but they uncork a lifetime so foreign to us today. Yeah, that lifetime is badly CGI-ed and filled with tan, blue-eyed men with chin dimples, but it gets us thinking about the Romans nonetheless.
4. Hit the {Serious} Books
Nothing beats a primary-source literature bath. To understand the Romans, one must read their words, marvel at the mosaics they left behind, see their skeleton structures. The Aeneid is nice & historical, but I’m talking about the meatier works — Julius Caesar’s Gallic Wars, the satire of Petronius, the personal letters that Cicero wrote to enemies, friends, and lovers (thanks for the inspiration, Mary Beard). A culture can be expressed through characters, and Mary Beard makes that evident in her Meet the Romans BBC series — reading the gravestones of imperial hairdressers, gladiators, and wine makers, she recreated life from thousands of years ago.
Besides primary sources, a Roman history dilettante should read seminal writings and critiques written in the last few centuries. The prime example of this is, of course, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon. Six volumes and published in the late 1700s, it discusses the reasons why Rome deteriorated, most notably by Christianity. A more recent *must read* is SPQR by my favorite intellectual, Mary Beard. Her first chapter situates readers in 63 BCE, during the throws of the Catiline Conspiracy and the Ciceronian executions — what a climax in the first few pages! I’m currently reading that book now, although I also have my eye on Resurrecting the Granary of Rome: Environmental History and French Colonial Expansion in North Africa.
5. Deck Yourself Out in Roman Jewelry
This isn’t strictly necessary (yes, I’ve said this before), but bejeweling your collarbone in Ancient denarius, a Roman currency, looks and feels like royalty. I bought a faded denarius with Hadrian’s profile from Civitas, an online coin dealer — it was only $50, so here’s to hoping it’s not a fake. Fitting the coin into a bezel (a plated ring the coin slips into), I then found a spare chain and aha! Now the Romans are literally close to my heart all the time. Forever 21 also sells bracelets made of fake gold ancient coins — it’s not the most savory or classy accessory, but I appreciate the nod to our forebears.
6. Adopt a Roman Diet for a Week
I’m not an expert on regular Roman diets, but I know it included a f*ck ton of grain, diluted wine, and homemade fish sauce spread on everything (in Latin, garum). By contrast, the rich ate lavishly, supplementing their goblets with fruits, cheese, rare meats (i.e. flamingo, duck, hare, snails), and lots of fish — it didn’t include any of the processed nonsense our palettes are used to.
As part of an upcoming Spoon article, I’m going to eat religiously Roman for a week — my mother just handed me a bottle of Portuguesier (a sweeter merlot), so let’s start this Bacchanalia. The oldest surviving cookbook in history, Cookery and Dining in Imperial Rome by Apicius, dates back to Ancient Rome. It describes in detail the opulence of Roman tongues and the food which modern people would consider gross and exotic — fish balls? Boiled ostrich? Ragout of brains anyone? I couldn’t eat those foods for a week, but I’m THRILLED about the plebeian alcohol and carbs.
7. Listen to Roman Music (aka the Lyre)
For all the audio learners out there, listening to traditional Roman music can set the SPQR mood. Roman music was heavily dependent on the lyre, a stringed instrument from classical Greece. Resembling the harp, it makes the listener simultaneously snoozed and hypnotized — it’s the music of cults, sounds of the Villa of the Mysteries. Music was traditionally played during funerals, although contrary to the popular phrase “Nero fiddled while Rome burned,” the fiddle was not around in Roman days. According to the History Channel, the Romans had the cithara (a wooden, stringed instrument) and the double-reeded aulos (the ancient version of the oboe). YouTube has several videos of European professors playing these outdated instruments, as well as the music of Michael Levy, a master lyre musician.
8. Watch Mary Beard Lectures on YouTube
My! Lady! I’ve already mentioned Mary Beard multiple times, but she’s truly an intellectual to be admired, praised, and learned from — her brain is impressive, but it’s her edge and distaste for sugar-coating that gets me. She’s a professor at Cambridge, author of several history books, a debater against Boris Johnson for Christ sakes, and yet she still says “bloody hell” during lectures! Any lady that can combine intellect with tongue-and-cheek is my kind of woman.
Her words fuse the modern and the ancient, the lascivious and high-brow. Watch her series Meet the Romans, take notes on her lectures about Women in Power, or marvel as she discusses portraits of Augustus. My early-morning routine includes boiling peppermint tea and fangirling over her excitement for the Romans. For Mary, the Romans aren’t crumbling headstones on the Appian way — they’re accessible if we read (or translate) close enough.
9. Travel to Rome
This tip seems obvious, but it’s difficult to grow an obsession without any substance. Walking in the Forum, seeing cats slink in the Largo di Torre Argentina (the square where Caesar was stabbed), or watching indigo skies through the Pantheon oculus is so much substance. Running into a literal brick wall of history is more affecting than listening to a podcast. There’s nothing like sticky hands after eating gelato outside the Circo Massimo. Dragging unwilling parents to Ostia Antica (an ancient port) is my idea of fun. I only became interested in Rome after traveling there — I didn’t know anything about ancient history; I just wanted to gorge on gelato and pizza. But the spell of the city creeps, like a mono contagion, overwhelming and all-consuming until you’re sitting in a closet scribbling notes about Nero. Or maybe that’s just me.
Hopefully this guide inspires readers to a) fly to Rome and/or b) hold the Ancients in a higher regard. Although we’re separated by 2,000 years, aspects of life like love, sex, food shortages, civil war, and satirical literature are familiar, both striking and unexpected. I will never stop being amazed by these humans, people I will never meet. I can read their poems, recreate their music, and steal little rock fragments from their remaining monuments — and yet they’re dead with nothing but epitaphs left. But despite dust and Latin separating us, they’re so close. Nothing unfamiliar about it.

by Robert Clines
Men cannot stop thinking about the Roman Empire. Viral social media posts and news outlets from The Guardian to Italy’s La Repubblica have all suggested that men are obsessed with Rome. Memes abound. Rome apparently crosses the minds of men anywhere from a few times a month to a few times a day! Rome remains a cultural touchstone, and that probably won’t change. Ancient history books remain best sellers; films like Gladiator or Ben-Hur are award-winning classics; Rome and Pompeii, as I saw firsthand this summer, are as crowded as ever.
As a scholar of Italian humanism, I spend a significant amount of time in Rome and I write about men who think about Rome. While I don’t find this phenomenon surprising, I believe it is problematic...and that’s because Rome is often equated with concepts like “Europe,” “Western Civilization,” and “whiteness.” No, the Romans were not white — whiteness as a marker of racial difference didn’t exist in antiquity. Romans weren’t even just from Italy or Europe. There were numerous Roman writers from Africa; the emperor Septimius Severus (145–211) was born in modern-day Libya; and Augustine of Hippo (354–430), a theologian whose works are central to Western Christianity, was from modern-day Algeria. But the Romans have been made white because white people — mostly men — have linked the Roman past to themselves.
Petrarch (1304–1374), whom we often problematically call the “Father of the Renaissance,” wrote letters to ancient figures like Cicero and Homer. After visiting Rome for the first time in 1337, he wrote “who can doubt that Rome will rise up again once she begins to recognize herself?” But what is the “self” Petrarch hoped Rome would recognize? Petrarch was writing after the Crusades and during the rise of the Ottomans and the papacy’s relocation to Avignon, France. This geopolitical reality led Petrarch to believe that Europeans must revive Rome and end the Middle or Dark Ages, which for him meant everything Rome was not and everything we should resist: backwardness, barbarism, unfettered violence, lack of culture.
Petrarch wasn’t alone. Humanists like Poggio Bracciolini (1380–1459) scoured libraries and monasteries for ancient texts. In his On the Vicissitudes of Fortune, Bracciolini used the ruins of the Roman Forum to wax philosophical on how far European society had fallen. Lorenzo Valla (1406–1457) believed the barbarians who destroyed Rome corrupted the purity of Latin; the result was Italian, which was called volgare. Biondo Flavio (1392–1463) called for restoring the Forum and Colosseum so they could be centerpieces in victory parades against Europe’s Muslim enemies, similar to ancient triumphs. Cyriac of Ancona (1391–1452) wrote about invading the Ottoman Empire to reclaim antiquities from Islam.
This preoccupation with the Romans as the forefathers of Western Civilization continued beyond Italian humanists as Europeans began building global empires. In two important essays in The New Centennial Review and Boundary 2, Sylvia Wynter shows how debates on the humanity of both Indigenous peoples and enslaved Africans centered on their perceived distance from Rome. Roman civilization’s purported Europeanness thus became justification for Indigenous genocide, mass African enslavement, and colonialism.
As their empires grew, Europeans constantly invoked Rome to prove white supremacy. In the eighteenth century, the Grand Tour — an educational journey that terminated in Rome or Naples — became an important way for wealthy Europeans and Americans to see themselves as the heirs of Rome. While in Italy, Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717–68), clearly unaware of ancient polychromy, saw the whiteness of Roman sculpture, including copies of Greek originals, as proof of European racial supremacy. As the historian Nell Irvin Painter argues, “Winckelmann elevated Rome’s white marble copies of Greek statuary into emblems of beauty and created a new white aesthetic.”
Winckelmann’s contemporary, Edward Gibbon (1737–1794), saw Rome as a moral lesson for contemporary Britain. In his History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Gibbon argued that the Roman Empire fell due to a lack of civic virtue and the onset of barbarism, i.e., foreign invasions. His now famous motivation from his memoir for writing captures the essence of white men thinking about Rome: “It was at Rome, on the 15th of October, 1764, as I sat musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol, while the barefooted friars were singing vespers in the Temple of Jupiter, that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the city first started to my mind.”
This linkage between Ancient Rome, imperialism, and white supremacy informed the new American Republic and how Europeans ran their empires. The Founders were obsessed with Rome and Greece, often citing ancient authors in their debates of what the United States would look like. This use of classically-inspired architecture, which has a long history, also appeared in Washington, D.C., plantations across the American South, and scores of other structures, linking the United States to Ancient Rome. As Lyra D. Monteiro shows, this neoclassical obsession is grounded in a racially-exclusive vision of the ancient past used to justify American settler colonialism, slavery, and white supremacy. Similarly, in European empires across the globe, perhaps most notably Britain’s, visions of empire and white supremacy have been mediated through antiquity. In French colonial North Africa, agricultural planning was based not on environmental realities, but on French attempts to revive North Africa as Rome’s breadbasket. Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy also put antiquity front and center in their supremacist ideologies.
Since Petrarch, the study of Rome has been tied to imperialism and white supremacy. We have to confront this reality and find new ways to show that the study of Rome need not be a project of whiteness or simply a passive exercise in drawing parallels between our world and theirs simply because we see ourselves in the Romans. It’s important to remember, as Keith Hopkins quipped, “Romans were dangerously different.”
But as teacher-scholars of antiquity and its reception, we face an uphill battle on two fronts. First is the belief that studying the past against the grain of whiteness is an attack on Western Civilization, which, as Kwame Anthony Appiah reminds us, doesn’t even exist. The School Choice Movement and the Classical Learning Test aim to shield students from a more critical study of the past, opting to celebrate antiquity as the font of Western Civilization. They want us to think more about Rome. I love Rome. Having spent a significant part of my life there, I am immersed in the practice...but how we think about Rome is where the problem lies.
The other battle is the increased neoliberalization of higher education and the shift toward job training and more “relevant” and presentist topics, even within the humanities. At the time of writing, there are only twenty-nine tenure track searches in classics nationwide. Ancient history and premodern history in general — where classical reception emerges — are faring far worse. According to the American Historical Association, only thirty-seven (about 8%) of all full-time history positions in 2022–23, both tenure track and non-tenure track, were in premodern history.
But if people are thinking about Rome every day, then it’s clearly relevant. Therefore, we should invest in research and teaching about Rome, its impact, and its reception in ways that change the narrative about its meaning. To be sure, scholars in ancient studies as well as in premodern critical race studies have been working hard to detach views of Ancient Rome from white supremacy. For example, two recent special volumes of the American Journal of Philology have tackled the legacy of white supremacy in the study of ancient literature. And I think there is an opportunity to capture the attention of students who think about Rome. I mean, who doesn’t want students who think about the topic of their class daily?! Courses on Greece and Rome are very popular, and my Renaissance class usually fills within twenty-four hours. When I take undergraduates to Rome, they are blown away by the heterogeneity of the city’s people, food, art, and history.
Because this pervasive white supremacist image of Rome doesn’t actually reflect any truth about the Roman Empire and its impact on the world, we have a responsibility as scholars and teachers to cultivate a deeper understanding of Rome in all its diversity and richness. It’s a job for all of us — from classicists to modernists and everyone in between — to help students abandon simplistic and often racist views of Rome and instead see its complexities, contradictions, and nuances. And thinking about that Rome every day is never a bad thing.

He is a literary historian of race, religion, and cross-cultural encounters in premodern Italy. His first book, A Jewish Jesuit in the Eastern Mediterranean, was published in 2019. He’s received research support from the Bogliasco Foundation, the Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, the American Academy in Rome, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and the US-Italy Fulbright Commission. His most recent essays have explored anti-Blackness and white femininity in Petrarch’s Africa and Orientalism and Roman ruins in fifteenth-century antiquarianism. He is currently completing a book manuscript entitled Ancient Others: Race, Empire, and the Invention of the Italian Renaissance.

I think about Rome all the time. Specifically, I think about the big-budget HBO drama Rome that ran from 2005–2007. That magnificent series was a richly realized historical epic that mixed sex and violence and back-stabbing political intrigue and served as a blueprint for the mega-hit series Game of Thrones, which was vastly inferior to its prototype in every way.
Rome was a show about power, loyalty, and betrayal set against the greatest empire in human history. Game of Thrones was lots of drinking from goblets, whispering secrets and dragons, and other childish bullshit. Game of Thrones was great fun, but it was always a naughty fairytale for adults.
Rome, on the other hand, explored big themes like ambition, love, and nudity.
I’m not the only person who thinks about Rome… and Rome. According to a recent social media trend, men think about Rome daily. The hashtag #RomanEmpire leads to videos with millions of views of women asking the men in their lives if they think about Rome and the men usually say “yes.” Let’s agree that social media trends are usually short-lived, superficial call-and-response games where someone, somewhere, posts an opinion or a hot take and then the entire internet, a…

How to slow down on your post-Pandemic trip to Rome. Do not rush to the famous sites, because the city has plenty of hidden, underrated monuments that give you an equal — and sometimes a better — taste of Roman art and history.
I n June 2021, Italy opened its borders to tourists from a range of countries, including the U.S., and allowed the vaccinated arrivals to skip quarantine. Soon afterward, I flew straight into Rome because after all, who knows how long the window of opportunity may last. After eighteen months without an international trip, I walked out of my guesthouse at Piazza di Spagna and began staggering around the hot streets of Rome, not knowing how to travel anymore. Should I immediately start taking photos as usual, or should I run to the Colosseum just to cross an item off a list? The confusion began to feel like a hangover after a long delirium. The kind of hangover that makes you want to start a new life. And with that, I made a decision — no return to the pre-Pandemic way of traveling; no hunt for pictures that are considered iconic; no visiting of the famous sites, or at least, not only the famous sites. I was in Rome, and I was craving to feel it, explore it, and learn from it. But how to turn the lofty sentiment into reality? Maybe by turning the trip into a search for hidden Rome, as I began to call the most underrated places in the city.
Just as it seems that luck begins to favor you as soon as you make the right decision, I quickly found out about another recent opening in Rome; one that received much less attention, but would let me step under the surface of the city — literally. On June 23, 2021, for the first time after many years, members of the public could enter Domus Aurea, the ancient palace of Emperor Nero. This could be my first foray into the realm of hidden Rome. For a reason unclear at first, however, the advertisement for the tour featured Raphael as well.
Traveling in the time of the pandemic
The walk to the palace leads around the Colosseum, where I reluctantly paused to take a picture after all. But while I was doing that, there was an unusual sound — the sound of the Italian language. Who would expect so much Italian at prominent tourist sites? Well, that was the Pandemic Rome. It is too soon to have meaningful figures, but my eyes estimated that the tourist numbers were at about a half of the pre-pandemic level, a rough figure in line with taxi drivers’ experiences, restaurant occupancy, and affordable hotel prices, even in the most central locations. Crucially, however, the new visitor demographics included much fewer inter-continental arrivals and somewhat more domestic ones, which created an atmosphere very different from from the 2010s, the decade of the world tourism explosion.
If you assume that having fewer visitors around means easier access into the Colosseum or the Vatican, you will be sorely mistaken. Yes, pandemic rules reduced the tourist figures, but they also limited the numbers of admissions into museums, galleries, St. Peter’s Basilica, and all the sites. Since the operation of some ticket offices was restricted as well, the most efficient way to see Rome in 2021 is to book all visits and tours online, at least several days in advance —as before the pandemic.
Narcissist’s house
At Domus Aurea, I joined a small group, and we were greeted by our guide Marcella because the only way to visit the palace is with a guided tour, provided in English as well as in Italian. Marcella is an archeologist, who worked directly on excavations of the elusive structure. She had a joy in her eyes, with the rest of her face behind a mask, when she saw us. She explained: “We have been restoring the palace for a long time — we have even excavated new rooms that no one had ever seen before. But then, there were no people to see it! So, it’s great to finally show our work to someone.” And with that, our group stepped into a large tunnel leading into the Esquiline Hill.
Since Domus Aurea lies underground now, the temperature hovers around 10ºC (50ºF). Soon, some fellow visitors began to put on sweaters. New lamps, installed during the period of closure, produced only a dim light for esthetic and conservation reasons. I had zero right to complain; this was my new way to see Rome, with the cold air of the city’s soil on my skin and limited opportunity to take well-exposed photos. The mysterious lighting made it indeed feel like we were discovering hidden Rome.
Nero built his palace on a plot in the heart of Rome, which was rather conveniently cleared up by the Great Fire. Given that previous emperors lived in what still resembled villas, Nero’s new residence caused outrage for its location and opulence. Many rooms had their walls covered with marble that sparkled in yellow color on contact with sunlight. Together with decorations of golden leaves, these effects gave the palace its name — the Golden House, as Domus Aurea translates.
So, why did we find ourselves underground? Marcella pointed to the bricked-up windows: “Trajan wanted to erase the memory of Nero, so he had the palace sealed off, covered with earth, and incorporated into the hill. That way, he created a platform on which he could build new baths — Trajan’s Baths, of course.” Unfortunately, the art and the marble were mostly ripped off from the palace and reused in the baths upstairs, which have eventually become ruins, too. But we do not need to feel bad because Nero did not get to enjoy his Domus Aurea either. During the construction, he toured Greece to participate in singing competitions — yes, he won all the first prizes — and after he returned to Rome, he was forced to commit suicide just six months after moving into the palace.
A hole in the ceiling
Precisely because we were underground, cut off from the honking and bustle of the streets, the immersion in the world of Ancient Rome was complete, or almost complete, because it still required a lot of imagination, aided by several new multimedia projections on the walls and by Marcella’s stories. We walked through tens of rooms. My neck began to hurt because I kept staring at the vaulted ceilings, some of which were 11 meters (36 feet) high. Those were made possible only because Romans, unlike Greeks, mastered the use of concrete. The remains of the artwork were sparse, but we did see ancient frescos of Trojan War scenes, painted columns showing off the art of perspective, and sketches of fantastical creatures. As history flows in waves, none of these paintings could have been made in the Middle Ages, by which time the required skills and creativity went into decline.
We ended the tour in the most famous of the rooms, the octagonal hall, and left the palace through another tunnel, which has a new ramp designed by the architect Stefano Boeri. The most intriguing spot of the tour was in one of the less important rooms, however. Neither a fresco nor a piece of marble. Marcella alerted us to a hole in the ceiling that someone dug out with simple tools, centuries after the palace was buried into the hill. That hole was an opening expanded by Renaissance artists who scaled down into what looked like a grotto with paintings. The grotto was discovered by accident when a 15th-century young Roman just fell into it while on a stroll.
These grotto visits left the artists in awe that turned into inspiration. One of the motifs they began to replicate was the painted frames around main frescos, full of small, fanciful creatures with animal bodies and human heads, or completely random shapes, made “without any rules,” as art books say. Such a style of art became known as the “grotesque.” The octagonal hall had a special exhibition on this connection between the Ancient and Renaissance eras. Given that Raphael was one of the painters who lowered himself into Domus Aurea, the theme of the whole tour became finally obvious.
A banker and his friend
Raphael created such an amount of art over his twelve years in Rome that even some of his more exquisite work is not well known. Visitors usually get to see the frescoed Raphael Rooms in the Vatican Museums, but then, in a book on Raphael, I read about Villa Farnesina, a suburban palace hidden in a park on the right side of the Tiber, which I identified as another potential hidden treasure. The walk to the villa turned out to be a pleasant, fresh air escape from the narrow streets of the city. You can cross the river on the Ponte Fabricio bridge built in 62 B.C., the oldest one standing in Rome, and take in the view of the surrounding greenery.
Villa Farnesina was built as the main Roman residence of one of the richest men of the Renaissance, Agostino Chigi, who was a banker from Siena and the papal treasurer. While architecturally the building met all the symmetry and elegance requirements of the era, its central room, the loggia, needed an eye-catching decoration. That was when Chigi reached out to Raphael, who was not only a fellow member of the Roman elite but also a close friend of the banker. Raphael got to work, which moved, however, at a suspiciously slow pace— at least according to Giorgio Vasari. The frustrated patron found out that the reason was Raphael’s frequent absence due to “the pursuit of carnal pleasures.” To ensure the painter would stay close to his work, Chigi allegedly asked Raphael’s mistress, with some reluctance, to move into the villa.
But after all, Vasari’s story might be just another example of Roman gossip blown out of proportion because Raphael’s workshop was so established that his assistants could paint by consulting the master’s drawings only, without requiring his presence. Even if Chigi had a lot of hassles with the artist, the result was more than worth it. The large ceiling fresco of Cupid and Psyche, with a blue background and a plethora of figures, many of them naked, of course, represents Raphael at the height of his career. Actually, he passed away only two years later. As I was admiring the work, with only one more visitor around, I also knew to look at the arches on the walls. There they were; the playful, abstract shapes of the grotesques — Raphael’s variation on what he had seen in Domus Aurea.
While I was on the right side of the river, I climbed up through a park to Gianicolo Hill, which stands above Villa Farnesina. The terrace at the top provides a panoramic view of the city, even though, unlike Paris, Rome does not have a single dominating structure. You can see the top of the Colosseum, the National Monument, Spanish Steps and domes of many churches, but none of them stand out, which makes the city appear uniform in the diversity of its architecture. The view is made scenic, nonetheless, thanks to the green skyline of the Sabine and the Alban Hills in the distance.
My view was suddenly interrupted by a guitarist on the terrace, who began playing romantic tunes for the Italian couples enjoying the panorama and gelatos. I got the memo — that spot is more for a Raphael and his mistress than for me and my geographic musings. The only problem was that all great terraces in Rome serve as rendezvous places, whether the Pincio Hill terrace or my favorite archeological viewpoint at the back of the Capitoline Hill.
La Papessa
A higher-than-usual number of people was storming through the streets on scooters and they were carrying Italian flags. The reason turned out to be simple — while I had already forgotten that the country won the Euro 2021 cup in soccer several days before, many Italians had not. Both the night of the final and the subsequent celebrations brought hundreds of people out, with pizzerias putting television sets on the streets and the city putting up a gigantic screen at the Colosseum. The ripples of cheers when Italy scored went through the narrow streets like a tsunami. There was a downside, however. Locals and visitors alike were religious about wearing masks indoors — in restaurants, museums, trains, shops — but then, some let their guards down at the crowded soccer-watching parties, which might have helped fuel an increase in the Covid-19 cases in Rome, leading to new rounds of restrictions.
Although it is romantically simplistic, I like to think that Romans took the pandemic on the chin because, in the end, their city is one big monument to a millennia-long history of fires, sackings, and much, much deadlier plagues. The Antonine plague of the 2nd century A.D. is thought to have contributed to the decline of the Empire. But there were many others. In 1657, a wave of plague claimed the life of the most formidable woman that Rome ever had — Olimpia Maidalchini Pamphilj, who was responsible for another hidden place in Rome that I was going to visit.
Under the right circumstances, Olimpia might have been a ruler in her own right, but in the Rome of her time, the only way to channel her ambition was through a man. Incredibly, that man was the brother of her deceased husband; she dragged the brother up through the hierarchy of the Church until he became Pope Innocent X. It would not have been a Roman story, however, if it did not include a spicy twist, which was easy to conjure up in their case. The city took it for granted that Olimpia was the pope’s lover. Even if that claim proved an exaggeration, no one can dispute that she became the power behind St. Peter’s throne. She made personnel appointments and decided on important issues — so much so that she got a derogatory nickname “La Papessa”, or the female pope.
The hidden worlds behind the doors of Rome
Olimpia knew how to leverage her position to amass a fantastic fortune for the Pamphilj dynasty. Fortunately for us, they invested a large chunk of it into something tangible — an urban palace stuffed with a world-class art collection, which survives to this day as Palazzo Doria Pamphilj, with its Galleria. In any other city, the gallery would be a top attraction. But in Rome, it must compete with other shrines of Baroque art, like Villa Borghese. If you plan properly and book a ticket in advance — the gallery is open only on limited days — you will be treated to a spectacle. The pale grey façade of the Palazzo hides behind scaffolding on the shopping avenue, Via del Corso. As with Domus Aurea, stepping inside means entering a completely different world. There is a quaint, green courtyard with a fountain in the middle and then a series of lavishly decorated rooms where the family lived. The highlight comes in the gilded Hall of Mirrors, with a grandeur that would make it shine even in Versailles.
The collections of the gallery, displayed throughout the Palazzo, include a Raphael, but the Pamphiljs represent a different era — theirs is the Rome of Bernini, Velázquez, and Caravaggio. The first two artists sculpted and painted Innocent X, and those works are exhibited in the Palazzo. Caravaggio was somewhat of a different story, given that he passed away thirty years before the ascent of the Pamphiljs. Even so, they spotted potential in the paintings of the forgotten artist and bought three pieces for their collection. The family was far-sighted in another aspect — they forbid their descendants to sell any works from the gallery, thus preserving this mini-Louvre behind an inconspicuous Roman door.
Once you start searching for hidden and underrated places in Rome, you will find them everywhere. One small door close to Piazza de Navona led me to the Chiostro del Bramante, a courtyard of a perfectly squared shape and with perfectly symmetrical columns. I chose that place to unwind after long walks because there was a café on the upper floor, with a view. While sipping my Americano, I watched people downstairs lining up for a Banksy exhibition inside the cloister. I was, however, more incited by the upper-floor door to the lounge of the coffee shop. I ended up walking in there, and once I got past the sofas occupied by youngsters with laptops, I reached a window that did not lead into a street but into a church. Inside, I could see a beautiful fresco on the wall. The fresco is called Sibyls. It was commissioned by Agostino Chigi, created by Raphael, and, apparently, evaluated by Michelangelo for the patron, so that the right amount could be paid to the painter. Is there any other city in the world where even an attempt to have a quiet coffee in a hidden spot turns into a preview of some of the most magnificent artists in history?

Many rulers throughout history were given epithets by their subjects, such as “the Terrible,” “the Great,” or even “the Holy” and “the Divine.” The Romans were no exception, though they generally preferred less flattering nicknames derived from some article of clothing favored by the emperor — like Caligula, meaning “little soldier’s boot,” or Caracalla, “the Gallic cloak.”
The same Romans gave their final emperor a rather disparaging nickname. In the best case, Flavius Romulus Augustus was referred to as “Augustulus” (“little Augustus,” “minor Augustus”), and in the worst case, “Momillus” (“little disgrace,” “shameful trifle”). Were these nicknames justified? If we speak of the unfortunate Flavius Romulus as a person, most likely not. He could not distinguish himself by either good or bad deeds. His father, General Orestes Flavius, put him on the throne when the lad was about fifteen years old. His reign ended ten months later, with Orestes’s overthrow and the abdication of his son. In reality, during all that time, Flavius Romulus did not rule personally — his father did.

As long as the Coliseum stands, Rome shall stand; when the Coliseum falls, Rome will fall; when Rome falls, the whole world will fall.” — Venerable Bede
Being thirty minutes late is considered normal here, while punctuality feels inappropriate.
Rome is a city where food is a religion. Here, people argue about the best carbonara with the same passion as they do about football. Where coffee is not just a drink but a way of life.
I was there in the summer, the air thick with the scent of espresso and the distant hum of vespas weaving through the streets. The sun hung high over the Eternal City as I made my way to the Colosseum, I ran my hand over the weathered stone. The heat was rising from the ancient cobblestones beneath my feet. With every step, history wrapped itself around me like a well-worn toga, heavy with the weight of emperors’ ambitions and gladiators’ final breaths.
These walls have seen emperors rise and fall, gladiators meet their fate, and crowds roar with bloodlust. They have witnessed the grandeur of Rome at its peak and its slow decline. Every stone here tells stories of the past, if only one could listen closely enough. The underground hypogeum, now exposed to the sky, once was full of life. Hidden…

Also known as the Eternal City, Rome is home to some of the most historic monuments, art, and architecture in the world. Harking back to a time when gladiator fights were the daily form of entertainment, the city is bursting at the seams with fascinating things to see and do.
If you’re not yet convinced, here are 7 reasons why you should visit Rome.
The central Trevi Fountain is one of the most famous fountains in the world. Tourists gather around its impressive carvings every single day to throw coins into the clear water and make a wish.
But it’s not just the Trevi Fountain that promises a showy display of water and statues. In fact, Rome has a lot of access to water thanks to the Roman aqueducts, and the Popes of the Renaissance and Baroque eras tried to outdo each other with the fanciest fountains, many of which you can still see around the city today.
Italian food is renowned for being delicious, but Rome boasts some of the most delectable dishes in the country. Roman artichokes are a firm favourite by locals and tourists alike, while the world-famous spaghetti alla carbonara was born in this wonderful city.
The Vatican (which sits snug in the confines of Rome) is bursting with works by Michelangelo. The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel is doused in his colourful artwork, while the sculpture of Pieta sits pretty nearby.
As well as these, you can also see his sculptures of Christ the Redeemer and Moses elsewhere in the city.
Despite being one of the best-known cities in the world, Rome isn’t particularly big. In fact, it’s small enough that you can see all the attractions on foot (even on the same day), but sizeable enough to find somewhere that nobody else has found, even during the busier periods.
Rome’s history game is incredibly strong — probably one of the strongest in the world, in fact. The entire city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and there are a jaw-dropping number of monuments, ruins, artworks, and feats of architecture to enjoy.
Keep an eye out for the many well-preserved ruins that date back to the Roman Empire, including the Colosseum, the Forum, and Palatine Hill.
Thanks to its location, Rome enjoys a particularly mild climate throughout the year. In the summer months it is gloriously warm, but it’s also extremely pleasant in the winter months, too. This means you can enjoy the sights at any time of the year and feel comfortable venturing there in low-season.
The city itself was founded on Seven Hills, many of which boast incredible views over Rome and its surroundings. For the ultimate hilltop experience, watch the sunset over the ruins of the city.

Rome is a city that captured my heart in ways I never expected. From the moment I arrived, I knew it was a place I would want to return to. The city’s remarkable blend of ancient history, rich culture, stunning art, and lively modern life creates a unique atmosphere that is unlike any other. It’s one of those cities that leaves an impression on you, with its timeless beauty and endless opportunities for exploration.
What impressed me the most was how history is alive in every corner. Walking through the ancient streets of Rome felt like being in an open-air museum. The majestic Colosseum, the impressive Pantheon, and the beautiful Trevi Fountain are not just stones; they are living testimonies of civilizations that shaped the course of humanity. Rome’s history is written in its ruins, its squares, but also in its people, who continue to live in a city full of symbolism and tradition.
Roman culture is equally fascinating, with a rich mix of influences from the Roman Empire, the Renaissance, and the Baroque era. I was in awe of the Vatican Museums, where the works of artists like Michelangelo and Raphael are found around every corner. The Sistine Chapel left me speechless, as if I were in the presence of one of humanity’s most important masterpieces.
What surprised me most about Rome is how it successfully blends its glorious past with a dynamic, modern life. Cafes, fashion boutiques, and lively squares filled with people made me feel that Rome is not only a historic city but also a place that is very much alive in the present. Every afternoon, I enjoyed strolling through its narrow, cobblestone streets, where I encountered a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the vibrant rhythm of the city.
Another aspect that made my experience in Rome even more special was the food. Roman pizza is something you must try, with an impressive variety of ingredients and styles. From the classic Margherita and Capricciosa to more innovative creations, pizza in Rome is a delight with every bite. I also couldn’t resist trying the famous Italian gelato. Roman gelato is an experience in itself — creamy, refreshing, and with flavors I didn’t find anywhere else. Every afternoon, I made it a ritual to enjoy a gelato while walking around the streets, which quickly became one of my favorite activities.
All in all, Rome has a unique magic. It’s a city full of history, art, and culture, but also a city that knows how to enjoy modern life. What impressed me most was how it manages to keep its ancient essence alive while moving toward the future. It’s a destination that is definitely worth visiting over and over again. There’s always something new to discover, and each visit leaves you with the feeling that there’s so much more to explore. I can’t wait to return!

When I visited Rome in May 2024, I kept a diary. This is my first attempt at travel writing and also a way for me to document my experience, since I’m not on Facebook or Instagram.
7th May 2024
This morning I woke up in Rome for the first time. I am also unemployed for the first time in my adult life, since I left my last job last week and I won’t start my new one until the 20th. This is also the first time I’m traveling alone and staying in a hostel (the Jo&Joe Roma, where I am currently writing from).
I arrived yesterday afternoon and I was equally excited and nervous about this solo trip. I enjoy my own company and the freedom of deciding how I spend my time, but I always missing having someone to talk to after spending too long alone. But the nervousness is gone now. It left me somewhere between the second and third glasses of wine I had at a restaurant called Da Edy last night, alongside the best carbonara I’ve ever had.
After that meal, I walked up to the Enni Morricone auditorium to see the Brad Mehldau Trio perform. On the walk, many of the walls were covered in Italian political posters. I occupied myself by looking at each of these and guessing whether the smiling candidates were left-wing, right-wing or centrist based on their appearance alone. I never looked up the answers… for all I know they were estate agents.
The concert itself was impressive. I saw Brad Mehldau a few years ago at the Barbican in London as a solo pianist. Compared to the delicate subtlety of that performance, the trio (which consisted of a pianist, bassist and drummer) was a jazz assault on the senses. The standout track was ‘Boomer’, which Mehldau was quick to clarify was named after his dog, rather than the maligned generation.
Rome is undoubtedly a touristy city, but that concert felt strangely provincial considering that Mehldau is an American musician. During my time there, I didn’t hear a word of English and not even a whisper of an American accent (which are usually hard to miss on the streets of Rome). After a whopping three encores, I walked back through a sleepy Rome. My mind was filled with the logistics of going to bed in a hostel for the first time — when I had checked in earlier, it was clear that I would be sharing the room with three others, but I hadn’t met them yet.
When I got back to my room, I was greeted by the sound of some deep snoring. I discreetly gathered my toiletries from my locker (which was located beneath the bed of the snoring stranger) and then I clambered up into my top bunk. The whole process reminded me of that scene in Toy Story 2 when Buzz and Woody are trying to sneak through a maze of cheetos without waking a dozing man. Later that night, when I was woken by another roommate turning the big light and stumbling around as they arrived, I realized that I had probably been overthinking it.
This morning, I met two of my roommates — an Aussie and a Russian who were both nice enough. The Aussie is half way through traveling the world after graduating university. The Russian is a little bit older and was less clear about his travels… I wanted to ask if he was dodging the draft for the war but, since we’d be sharing a bedroom for the next few days, I decided not to raise that topic.
I then left to visit the Barberini palace, which was stunning. The highlights were a medieval painting of Saint Jerome trampling on a cartoonishly devilish Lucifer and another which featured two cherubs trying to share a papal hat. But the best of them all, undoubtedly, was Judith Beheading Helofernes by Caravaggio. Maybe I’m just a fanboy but I found it astounding how much better his painting was compared to the work of his contemporaries. The chiaroscuro, facial expressions, depth and resonance completely outshined every other painting in the room.
In a couple of hours I’m heading to the capuchin catacombs. Until then, I think I’ll sit in the hostel courtyard with a book and a red wine.
8th May 2024
I was spending this afternoon with a book and a red wine in the courtyard (yes, again) but I have been chased inside by a downpour, so here I am writing.
The catacombs yesterday did not disappoint. It began with a museum which took me through the history of capuchin monks, from when St. Francis first founded the order in the 16th century through to the modern-day. There is something about their asceticism and devout poverty that I find fascinating — mainly because I cannot relate whatsoever. I do doubt somewhat whether they practiced what they preached… who knows what they actually got up to beneath those oversized robes.
The catacombs themselves were a series of six rooms which literally took my breath away. They featured intricate sculptural displays built from pelvises, skulls and every other bone in the body — together forming the shapes of flowers, crests, chairs etc. These sat alongside dismantled corpses, some of which were mummified. Some bodies lay in coffins which were themselves built from various bones while others sat upon thrones built of skulls. This seemed contrary to what little I know about Christian burial rituals and I asked myself whether these friars had consented to having their skeletons on display, and whether they had any idea that tourists (like myself) would be ogling at their corpse hundreds of years later. I’ve told people that I don’t care what happens to my body after I die (since I’ll be dead) but now I will add the caveat that I’d rather not have my skeleton dangling on display in a popular tourist destination.
After the catacombs, I decided to wander over to the Borghese gardens. I didn’t bother with the Borghese gallery itself since half of it is under renovation. Instead I bought a couple of cans of Peroni and lounged in the park. After that, I stumbled upon the National Gallery of Modern Art, an impressive classical building. I wandered in. The art was generally good but unremarkable but I was surprised to stumble upon ‘Fountain’ by Marcel Duchamp, which simply consists of a signed urinal presented in the middle of a room. My surprise was dampened when I realised that this was one of many replicas (the original is lost) though it still reminded me of my Masters degree, when ‘Fountain’ came up in a module titled ‘Thinking With Things’. The whole point is that we perceive a urinal differently when it has been displaced from its typical surroundings — we would never consider pissing in a urinal when it’s presented as a piece of art. Context transforms our perspective and ‘Fountain’ demonstrates that more clearly than anything else. It spurred a lot of art criticism and debate but still, I bet Duchap couldn’t believe that he got away with that one.
When I got back to the hostel I bumped into my Aussie roommate who, like me, was exhausted and hungry. Neither of us wanted to walk very far, so we stumbled into a random touristy restaurant near our hostel. He had carbonara while I went for the rogue choice of steak tartare with a side of artichoke. The artichoke was delicious, soft and garlicky, while the tartare was quite underwhelming — much chunkier than the typical French-style tartare which I adore.
We finished the night at a nearby ‘Irish pub’ called ‘The Flann O’Brien’. Like most continental Irish pubs, it was nothing like an Irish pub. But I was drawn there when I spotted Hop House 13 on their menu (a lovely pale ale made by the Guinness brewery which is no longer sold in the UK) while the Aussie was drawn to the football. We had a wide-ranging chat — I was thankful when it moved from football on to politics and cultural differences. Later that night, when I was in bed, I heard the Aussie get up from his bunk and vomit in the bathroom. I worried that the restaurant was to blame and that my steak tartare would soon reemerge, but thankfully I got a decent sleep.
I didn’t have much of a lie-in, as I was up at 6:30am to get to the Vatican museum in time for my 8:30am tour. I had been told that the crowds are a lot more manageable at this time but, when I arrived, I was amazed at the length of the queue that was already forming around the ancient walls of the Vatican. Thankfully my tour ticket meant that I could bypass this queue completely, and I felt quite smug as I waltzed past those tourists who lacked my advance planning skills.
I didn’t know whether an actual tour guide or audio guide awaited me so I was pleased and impressed by Antonio, our tour guide who had an infectious enthusiasm for the place. We moved through the halls of the Vatican like a slow tide of tourists — it was already heaving at that early hour. But Antonio did a great job of pointing out the most impressive sights as we were shepherded along by the Vatican guards. Without a guided tour, I imagine it would be nearly impossible to appreciate the art and architecture while trying to battle through the crowded maze of corridors. Antonio abandoned us in the galleries that precede the Sistine chapel, giving us the option to march on to the chapel or peruse the artwork first. I was seemingly the only person to choose the latter option, so it was nice to wander the relatively empty galleries (featuring Picasso, Francis Bacon, Van Gogh) after having spent a couple of hours within a horde of tourists.
I headed back into the throng as I made my way into the Sistine chapel. Michelangelo’s frescoes were impressive, as expected, but I was struck by how garish I found the chapel, with every inch of wall dedicated to another saint or bible story. Unlike other impressive churches I’ve seen, where artwork has room to breathe, it was hard to appreciate ‘The Final Judgment’ or ‘The Creation of Adam’ when my peripheral vision was so crowded with various depictions of different popes and apostles. Arguably the biggest takeaway is sheer astonishment at how Michaelnagelo managed to paint the frescoes directly on those high ceilings — achieving such a delicate touch while balancing on shaky scaffolding high above the ground.
It was around midday when I left and I was hungry. I headed towards Trattoria Der Pallero, which had been recommended as a traditional Roman restaurant with a set-menu. I sat down and feasted on nine plates of food — tomatoes, beans, anchovy salad, suppli, two pastas, cured meat, mozzarella, crisps (strangely) and cake. It was absolutely glorious — maybe one of the most satisfying meals I’ve ever had. It was serene to sit beneath the awnings with a carafe of wine and a good book as a friendly Roman man brought me dish after dish. All that for just 30 euros… if I lived in Rome I would be there every week.
The meal and my morning in the Vatican City exhausted me, so I’m going to take it easy this evening. Tomorrow, the Colosseum.
9th May 2024
Last night I got back to the room and the Aussie (whose name I now know is Alec) was there. I said I was looking for a light dinner so he suggested Pinsallegra, a fast food place around the corner which serves pinsas, a type of light crispy pizza. It hit the spot. After that, we headed back to the hostel and had some pints while chatting about traveling and reality tv. We were both exhausted so it was an early night. He left the following morning at 7am to catch a train to Florence — I happened to be up for a wee as he was leaving, so I said bye.
I got up proper a couple of hours later and headed to the Colosseum. There were two lines snaking around the arena, one for ticket holders and one for those without. Thankfully I spotted a sign between the two lines which said ‘Full Experience Tickets’ and that’s exactly what I had. After a quick security check, I was in. I soaked it all up for a bit before heading to the underground, an area which my semi-exclusive ‘Full Experience’ ticket gave me access to. I don’t know whether it was a logistical mistake or as planned, but at this point I was unexpectedly welcomed into a tour group. Our guide brought us through the ‘backstage’ of the Colosseum — the rooms and corridors where the gladiators prepared before boarding the rudimentary lifts which would carry them up into the battleground. Obviously it’s a ruin so, while the magnitude was impressive, it takes some imagination to transport yourself back to gladiatorial times. Apparently, over 400,000 people have died fighting in the Colosseum, making it one of the bloodiest square miles in the world. That thought contrasts against the modern-day reality of the Colosseum: an icon for Rome and a backdrop for selfies.
I had spent about three hours in the Colosseum, so I was hungry and ready for lunch. I made my way across the Tiber into the trendy Trastevere district, where I gorged myself at Sesamo, which serves these odd burger-pizza hybrids. I sat down to eat in their small dining space and next to me was a family from East London. It almost felt like I was back in London, sat in a chicken shop after a night out.
After lunch, I made my way to the Forum, stopping midway for a delicious red berry gelato. When I arrived at the Forum, I was awed. The columns, temples, ruins and gardens were sprawling. It’s baffling how so much (or anything at all) has survived almost two millennia of warfare, plundering and natural disasters. I had no tour or audio guide as I wandered around the Forum so, while I was relatively less well-informed than I was for the Vatican and Colosseum, I had more freedom to walk around at my own pace and soak it all in. The sun was shining and I had a lovely afternoon exploring the Forum while listening to Cassandra Jenkins on my headphones.
After a few hours at the Forum I was tired and, though there was undoubtedly more to see, I knew I had reached my fill of Roman antiquity. I headed back to the hostel. I have not been disappointed by pasta and pizza in Rome, but tonight I fancied something different. I settled on Prosciutteria Cantina dei Papi, a charming spot specializing in cured meats, cheese and wine. I took my seat and asked for a nice wine and a large platter — no menu necessary. It was a feast and probably the best wine I’ve had in Rome. I had a nice seat where I could watch tourists wander the streets while I snacked away.
It was relatively early in the evening, so I was the only person in there except from two young Polish women a few tables over. They made an odd couple, one quiet and reserved and the other one full of energy. At one moment the energetic one convinced the young Italian proprietor to dance with her. He lasted just a few seconds before turning to me with a desperate look and asking “Would you like to dance with her?”. After I declined, I got chatting to the other Polish woman, who became the second person on this trip to tell me that I don’t sound like I’m from London. I asked her what I sound like to her and said ‘normal English’ before putting on her best Dickensian cockney impression to show me what she expected from a Londoner.
That place was just around the corner from the Trevi Fountain, so I headed over to tick it off my list. I had been hugely underwhelmed by the Spanish Steps (it is literally just a staircase) so I wasn’t expecting much. But I was actually blown away by the majesty and intricacy of it — the pristine marble sculptures and the crystal blue waterfall — I’m glad I didn’t miss it. As I stood there, I started to hear clapping and whooping and spotted a man down near the front of the fountain getting down on one knee to propose. The entire crowd cheered as she said yes. It was a lovely moment of collective celebration… though I wouldn’t personally pick such a busy touristy crowd for a proposal.
I’m back at the hostel now, writing this with a beer by the fountain. The cinema across the road is showing the film Wicked Little Letters in English with subtitles in an hour, so I think that’s a good idea to unwind for the night.
11th May 2024
The Italian cinema was surprisingly different from what I’m used to. You cannot be late. As soon as the film starts, the doors seemingly lock, with a light turning ominously from green to red. Also, instead of showing over 30 minutes of advertisements, there are just four or five trailers before the film gets started. The auditorium was quite empty when I arrived so I took a central seat. Minutes later, someone came up and sat right beside me. I don’t know whether they valued the best view or were just committed to the seat on their ticket but this would never happen in the UK where we are much more precious about our personal space (unless you’re on the tube).
The film was fine but unremarkable. It did a good job of making me sleepy and ready for bed. In my half-dazed state, I was surprised to see the other cinemagoers head to a back door rather than back the way we entered. This took us straight through to an alleyway which led to the street. I had only seen this system before in old American movies and I found it oddly charming.
In the morning I made my way to the Vatican City. I had a ticket for the Castel Sant Angelo that would allow me entry at any time, so I planned to hit St. Peter’s Basilica early in the morning, while the sun was still low and the crowds still slim. I was making my way down the Borgo Santo Spinta, the wide road leading towards St. Peter’s Square. I found it strangely quiet and I noticed that the road itself was roped off, with policemen standing alert every few meters. Then a convoy of three or four cars started rolling slowly down the road from the direction of the Vatican. A thought briefly crossed my mind before I dismissed it but then… there he was: in the front passenger seat of one of the cars was the pope himself in full regalia and with a preoccupied look on his face. I was surprised that he was so visible — sat upfront in a slow car rather than hiding in the back behind tinted windows. A group of American tourists behind me shrieked in ecstasy and I made my way to the Basilica.
Even though it was only about 8:30am (no lie-ins for the pope either), the crowd was already vast. It took some time simply to discover where the queue that snaked around the square ended. I eventually joined it and questioned whether to stick it out — I had just seen the pope himself after all, it would be hard to top that. This seemed to be the one queue in Rome that I couldn’t avoid with a premium ticket. Entry to the Basilica is free, so everyone queues together. Even the tour guides with groups of 10–20 tourists had to endure the long queue — I watched as they struggled to keep their guests occupied and interested by sharing little bits of trivia about the Vatican.
I endured and, after almost two hours, I was in. The Basilica is undoubtedly impressive (and much less gauche than the Sistine chapel). It is intricate and vast, with walls and columns that stretch so far and high that it almost feels like you are standing within some kind of microclimate. While I was impressed by the baroque art & sculptures I did find it hard to appreciate them. I much prefer the Gothic atmosphere that you find in cathedrals like Durham. After thirty minutes or so, I had my fill and headed out.
I headed to Castel Sant Angelo (which is also known as Hadrian’s Mausoleum). It was immediately impressive how many different roles this building has played throughout history — mausoleum, papal residency, prison, fort and now a museum — it is the swiss army knife of antiquity. Like a palimpsest, there are visible layers of development. History is visible through the distinct layers of bricks and the slight changes to the architecture as you move from floor to floor. I enjoyed wandering its grand halls and admiring the views across Rome. But after five days of sight-seeing, it was clear that my patience for admiring art and reading my way through museum exhibitions was thinning.
I headed back to the hostel to do some laundry and pack for my departure the next day. I realized that I had just one sight left unticked on my list: the Pantheon. When I arrived, I found it almost cute how the ancient Pantheon is tucked away in a modern bustling Roman square. Rather than standing proud upon a hill (like some of the ruins in the Forum), it shyly sits amongst hotels and restaurants. When I entered, it was hard not to stare up constantly — the dome is an incredible sight and, for the first time on this holiday, I was hoping it would rain so that I could witness the rain fall through the hole in the dome and down into the building.
I found the interior disappointingly Christian — I would have preferred hellenistic statues and relics over the pulpits and crucifixes which greeted me. Like a dog pissing on a lamppost, the Catholic church have crudely claimed the Pantheon as their own. This isn’t an exception in Rome — I had noticed the day before that they had even literally planted their flag in the Colosseum by displaying a large modern crucifix in the middle of the arena. I suppose I should be grateful. These sights wouldn’t have survived to this day if the Christians hadn’t laid their claim, protecting them from being deconstructed for materials or caught in the crossfire of war.
After the Pantheon, I headed to Pompi, a takeaway tiramisu place which had been recommended by a work colleague who is from Rome. It was ok — it had been made without alcohol so it was missing a certain depth of flavour.
I retired to the hostel for the evening, where I sat in the courtyard sipping wine for the last time. I was joined by Dan, the new Aussie who had replaced Alec in the bunk below me. He’s the head chef of a fancy restaurant in Melbourne, so I enjoyed quizzing him on the restaurant business: “Are specials really just a way to get rid of excess ingredients?” (sometimes) “Do celebrities get better treatment?” (Yes). It was the right way to end my time in Rome — sat in the evening sun sipping wine, eating pasta and talking about food.
That concludes my time in Rome. The food, history and culture did not disappoint. I also discovered the joy of solo travel for the first time — enjoying both my own company and brief encounters with fellow travelers. That said, five days was the perfect amount of time and I would always rather share the experience. As I write, I am speeding towards Naples on a train. I can’t wait to spend a few days with Ashley in the sun.

Walk down the jet bridge in your comfy cute style, ready for your first day in Rome. Just skip packing your Gucci python print heels on this escapade.
You can look stylish wandering Rome by looking at number-two of these 12 Rome tips without looking like the goofy tourist in your wanderlust.
We chose to fly to Roma on Easter weekend for our very first time. I’m in-touch with the crazier ideas when it comes to traveling and now know how to keep you from looking the out-of-sorts maniacal traveler.
Easter weekend — in the Catholic capitol — we thought, “Lets visit Rome!”
One-step-nuttier…We added a tour of the Vatican on the list!? {Go off the high dive of nuts — or don’t go at all!}
If you knew my Hubs, this sort of crazy optimism wouldn’t be so shocking. He’s an “all-in”, “it’ll be fine” kinda guy.
And if you don’t make it into Vatican City, there’s always a gelateria nearby ready to serve it’s oh-so-sweet-goodness. Gelato makes everything better!
On to the gelato! {Plus the 12 tips}
If you’re traveling to Rome, these are the 12 best travel tips to keep you from looking like the nutter tourist…
The midday rest hours is a thang in Italy, but slowly drinking your coffee is not. Order your frothy cappuccino or caffè macchiato {an espresso with a splash of milk} at the bar, take your receipt to pick up your cuppa, and drink up. Sitting down at a table to leisurely drink can double your bill {table service fee}.
The cobblestone streets of Rome are part of its old world charm. You’ll be doing a lot of walking along those cobblestone streets, and heels don’t fit this trip {they do fit nicely in the cobblestone cracks and break your heels though}. Save your cute spikes for your Asheville weekend.
There are good walking-around stylish shoes to pack for walking Rome::
When you pop into the small boutiques or family-owned shops, greet the owner {most small shops or artisan workshops are operated by the owners}. Greet them with “Buongiorno” {good day} until afternoon and “buonasera” {good evening} after. {Ciao is an easy hi/bye, if that’s what you’re looking for}.
No need to rattle off Eat, Pray, Love in Italian, but making an effort to speak the language goes a long way in ANY COUNTRY you visit {except for maybe France. Depending on who you try it with, they can get a bit testy}.
As with ANY TRAVELING, keep an eye on your bags. In crowded areas {and all of Rome’s popular sites are overflowing with people}, carry your bags on your front or use a protected travel backpack like this one.
SIDE STYLE TIP:: Belt bags are the new fanny packs 😉 I bought mine in the wine color because it’s purty. But turns out it’s a BRILLIANT CHOICE if you’re a wine spiller too 🙋🏼‍♀️ {anyone else raising their hand?}
We are walkers most of the time, but getting to certain places in Rome requires wheels. The city buses were those wheels that Easter trip. Buy your tickets ahead of time because they DO NOT sell tickets on the bus.
Buy tickets at any tabaccheria in the city. Shops are designated with a large “T”. Tickets are €1.50 each, or choose a 24-hour, 48-hour, or weekly ticket for a discounted price. Tickets are valid for all public transportation in Rome (bus, metro, tram and local train).
Bypass the lines and purchase tickets to the more popular sites AHEAD OF TIME. Many of these sell out quickly. Do a little planning ahead and buy your tickets online before your trip. { Vatican and Sistine Chapel, Colosseum, St Peter’s Dome & Basilica tour are big hits}
You don’t need a ticket to visit Trevi Fountain, but it’s wildly popular and not much fun squishing your way through a ka-jillion of your closest strangers. Grab your cappuccino and make that your first view of the day.
OORRRR, make a night stop to see it under all the beautiful lights. We did both, and 18/19 tourists agree…nighttime viewing is best, mainly because…fewer peeps standing around in your photos 📷
We ran out of time, but one tour that’ll be on our 2024 trip itinerary is the traditional pasta-making and wine tour in Frascati {40-min train ride from Rome}.
Since the pandemic, credit cards aren’t the frowned upon payment they once were, but good ol’ coin still reigns supreme — especially in smaller-run businesses.
Keep some on hand during your trip.
One of THE BEST parts of foreign travel is the exposure to other cultures. Dinner in Rome might be one of those adjustments, unless you’re a snacking queen like myself🤗
Dining and drinking are rituals in Italy. Don’t rush. First, enjoy an aperitivo. You’re meeting up for a pre-dinner drink and light eats {similar to Happy Hour} at 7pm, after a day of sight-seeing.
However, don’t eat too much Italian deliciousness, because dinner follows around 8, 9, or even 10pm.
Might want to grab an extra caffè macchiato for your long Roman days to keep moving until dinner, or take a midday rest {riposa} like the locals, from 1–3-ish.
This Art of Aperitivo post will help you fit in with the locals at aperitivo time.
Anytime + all-the-time is when you look for your next gelateria to try a new flavor. DO NOT LEAVE ROME without trying at least one flavor, no, five…maybe six. Depends on the season, since they keep rotating.
Order the house wine –you’ll love it– and don’t expect pizza drowning in sauce.
It’s the simple cooking that makes Italian foods mouth-watering, along with the extra pounds you’ll pack home with you. 😬
Enjoy it the way it comes. Don’t ask for sauces {I see you, ranch lovers} or try to salt your capressi or bruschetta into a cardiac arrest.
Yes, Italians love their pastas, pastries, and pizza {as well as coffee, wine, and gelato…}. But believe it or not, there are also salad and vegetable options. Look under “CONTORNI” on the menus {their side dishes}.
Always, always, for the love of Italy, save space for dessert + your after-dinner-sip of limoncello.
That said, you’ll want to put foreign phone service on at least one phone in your party. Wi-fi can be spotty at hotels and cafés.
If you’re using your phone for directions on your trip, pay extra to add on foreign service {or check out the BONUS TIP BELOW}.
Whenever we’ve gone international with our teens, they didn’t have phone service. I’m a mama who has her kids back! No Snap notifications, texts, games… BEST TRIPS EVVV-ER!

When the modern man is on break at work, does he ever wonder about Rome? What would it be like to live in Rome? In this article, I will answer these burning questions. We shall explore the fascinating world of ancient Rome and her people, starting with the lowest classes — the slaves — working towards the freedman, the artisans, the patrician class, and finally, the emperor and his family.
To keep our imagination engaged, we shall compare pagan Rome with Christian Rome — their customs, laws, and government. Let us see how they compare.
Pagan Rome, like many before and after her, assigned her citizens into a ‘caste’ system; that is, whichever caste or part of society you were born into, that is where you stayed… period. No one from the lower castes — slaves and poor merchants — could move up the social hierarchy without the nobility’s sign-off. However, there was one unique citizen (this did depend on who their former master was) who enjoyed more perks than the patrician class. Former slaves, called freedmen, would wonder about the empire trying to start a new life. For the vast majority, life was still hard and full of suffering. The emperor’s former slaves had it differently. Ambition and ego caused distrust between family members and the royal house: many emperors trusted their household slaves more than their family members and senators. This was especially true for the tyrannical emperors.
To counter potential plots and schemes, many emperors, the most infamous of which was Claudius, would assign essential matters of the crown to their loyal, well-educated freedmen. In a tavern or banquet, one could hear about Claudius sending his freedmen on diplomatic duties to a senator he despised. Robert Knapp, in his book Invisible Romans, gives us an idea of the attitude of Roman elites,
The hatred of imperial freedmen especially, but uppity freedmen in general, brought scathing opprobrium to focus on this societal group. To keep them at bay, they were disparaged as forever despised, inferior; they were marked by law and custom as unworthy of mixing with the elite in politics or marriage or anything (pg. 171).
Under Roman law, slaves had no intrinsic, God-given value while in bondage. (Christ and His teachings did mark a change in Roman society towards slaves. Gradually, slaves became known as ‘serfs’, a class with limited rights under the law — nevertheless, it was a step in the right direction. The ‘citizen’ held the right of sovereignty (participation in politics), which was reserved for Rome’s patrician class — especially during the empire, as Augustus ensured this was the case. Any citizen of Rome, from the emperor to a wealthy freedman, could own slaves. (However, freedmen were banned from holding political offices.) The practice was not limited to the patrician class. Roman citizens could do whatever they wanted with their property, and many did.
In pagan Rome, religion played a meditating role between ruler and ruled. Barbarian tribes became Romanized over the generations thanks to a Roman policy of sending chieftain sons to Rome for schooling. A Roman teacher could draw similarities and suggest that Romans and barbarians worshipped the same gods under different names. Polytheistic religions are helpful in this regard — the gods of Rome dominate. Yet, there are no significant differences in terms of teachings on how to live the good life in polytheistic religions. Also worthy of note is the caste system. Caste systems — the ordering of society — did exist outside of Rome’s borders. In principle, barbarians ordered their kingdoms in much the same way as the Romans; the only difference was who stood at the top. In Rome: the emperors and his nobles. In Germany: a Germanic chieftain and his nobles.
Before Christ and His teachings began to ring through the ears of Rome’s elite, preaching a life, by authority of the Ten Commandments, of modesty and chastity for both sexes. Pagan Rome’s idea of happiness and meaning is found in worshipping The Self. Biblical religion, unlike Pagans, is a willingness to submit their will to the Lord: a living, just and holy God outside of time and space who communes with man via the Holy Spirit. One can have a relationship with Him by following His Commandments, his Son’s teachings, and listening to His spirit — the Holy Spirit.
Because of the lack of Commandments in Pagan religions, people would worship particular gods of this phenomenon or archetype. Meaning they would pray to the sky, sea, or earth, all phenomenon inside Creation. Therefore, if you wanted to live your life in the pursuit of pleasure, you would find yourself a member of the Dionysian cult — the god of wine and pleasure. Every pagan god, the Christians would claim, is nothing more than an archetype of human nature or Creation; therefore, if one chooses to worship Dionysus or ISIS (the Great Mother Goddess), one becomes Dionysus or ISIS. Morality becomes subjective as these gods are not lawgivers or the revelation of Truth in the cosmos.
Consequently, people worship whichever deity they believe will bless them the most. Pagans choose which gods to worship to serve their own needs. In the Christian paradigm, all humans are under the Lord’s authority whether they like it or not, and acts of sin (like idolatry) will lead us down a path filled with lies and misery.
Public baths are an excellent case study as they give us some idea of Rome’s impression of nudity. The Caesars would try to outbid each other with their public works buildings, a favourite being public baths. During the empire, the sexes were separated from one another, depending on the number of scandals. However, it must be noted that the law was changed because too many people got caught fornicating. It was not a decision born of Biblical principles: man’s propensity to sin forced the empire to act.
To sum up, Pagan Rome’s view on sex was very liberal. State-sponsored brothels and Dionysian parties did indeed occur regularly. The lack of moral values in pagan religions meant the state tolerated this behaviour, only interfering if things of out of hand. In pagan Rome, one could complain about this despicable behaviour, but the state would not legislate against such behaviour. Many have probably attended such festivities and were unwilling to take the risk. Prior to Christianity, sexual sins were part of the higher culture — which only got worse as Rome began to expand her borders. Republican senators of the empire, inspired by the likes of Cato and the Stoics, longed for the long-forgotten values that made Rome. Her men have been corrupted by the pleasures she has to offer.
The courts in Rome during the Republic were mainly dominated by one particular faction, family, or alliance. Rome’s republican government was designed to stop the tyrannical will of one man, which it did pretty well. However, ambitious men serving the will of Rome would rule through alliances and ‘favours’ owned by men they helped, receiving special treatment and privileges. Sulla is one such example. Nepotism was hard to combat in such a system due to the lack of a rival branch of government: control over Rome’s legions was all one needed.
The caste system in Roman society made it hard for everyday men and women to prosecute someone above their station. I imagine freedmen and artisans (like blacksmiths) did not take crimes committed by nobles to the courts — they had no money nor the will to do so. Very often, in such situations, another member of the patrician class would stand in on behalf of the lower classes. Usually, to the detriment of his standing within Rome’s elites, one ought not to spend time with slaves and peasants. During the Republic, a Stoic senator who governed Sicily so well the Sicilians wanted to make him an honorary Sicilian managed to find himself in court.
What is the charge, you ask? Jealousy. Rivals jealous of our senator’s competencies and deserved admiration from his peers, his rivals, filled with the spirit of Kane, wanted nothing more than to witness his fall from grace. The kangaroo court sentenced him to exile. Roman law and legislators only applied to Roman citizens — leaving the rest to be exploited — and anyone challenging the status quo would meet the same faith as our senator.
Not much changed during the reign of the Caesars. The nature of monarchical governments — where one man’s will is enacted throughout the government — is seen as divine and just, as the emperor was considered a living god. An opposition voice or party being considered in the Senate is unlikely. No man would dare question the emperor’s divine will unless he was willing to part with his head. Monarchical systems can work well… it all depends on the grace and disposition of the emperor. Plato’s Republic was the model for ancient kings and emperors: over the years, many attempts were made to live up to the ideal of the philosopher-king, although most never came close to the title. Plato claimed that men of philosophy made the best rulers. Marcus Aurelius is a good example. However, many did give in to sin and thus became evil rulers of themselves and their subjects.
The law did begin to change thanks to Christian ethics. The story of Moses freeing the Jews from bondage was no longer told to Jewish children. Greek and Latin were the common languages in the Roman Empire. The story of God leading Moses and the Jews out of Egypt could, thanks in part to the Romans, reach every ear within her border. In effect, the Biblical ethos told through the prophets of the Bible eventually influenced, at first, Rome’s culture and customs as more and more people started to see reality through the eyes of Christ. This would lead to a change in the law justified by Biblical ethics. One would ponder: is this law Christ-like?
Tell me, dear reader, would you last a day in Pagan Rome?

«Governing the Italians is not difficult; it’s useless.»
This made-up quote has been falsely attributed to various historical figures: the fascist dictator Mussolini, the politician Giovanni Giolitti, and even Winston Churchill.
But the phrase contains an element of truth, as it’ll be apparent the moment you arrive in Italy’s capital.
It’s way dirtier and scruffier than a big European capital city has any right to be.
Especially one that charges every visitor who stays overnight 7.50€ of city tax per day.
The traffic (and the noise and pollution it generates) is atrocious, to the point that, at times, it made even a lifelong gearhead like me wish cars were never invented.
But try using public transport, and you quickly realize why there are so many cars around. Just two metro lines (plus one under…

I’ve never felt like this when going to the Italian capital. This sense of inadequacy, to be surrounded by misery at every corner and corruption.
“Maybe I was ignoring it all and just focusing on its helpless fascination when I lived here in 2017 for a semester and during subsequent visits?” I ponder as I exit the Roma Termini station and start heading to a coffee shop for breakfast — of course, a croissant and cappuccino.
I need to head to the American embassy later on to get my visa approved to go to the US. To do so, I’ll cross a big chunk of the city center by foot.
I can’t get out of my mind the stats I recently heard on an Italian investigative journalism program (the last bastion of seriousness in an otherwise trash-populated TV):
80%, perhaps 90% of business activities in Rome are in the hands of mafia.
80, 90%.
There is a chance that I had breakfast in one of their bars, and very likely later on, I will have lunch in another one too.
Businesses of any type are utilized by various…

January 3, 2022|Italy
Today, I walked through the heart of non-ancient Rome. Twice. The first time solo and in the daylight. The second time after sunset with Boo.
I started the day with what has become my Italian hobby — doing laundry. You may think that we are extra dirty or changing our clothes several times a day, but the truth is that European washing machines are shockingly tiny. I can only do about a quarter of what would be a load in my big honking American washer. I shudder to think what families with children must do about laundry here in Europe. The washing machine must run 24/7. That’s been nearly the case for us, and we’re just two relatively clean adult women (although we’ve had our moments). And there’s generally no clothes dryer which means that everything has to be painstakingly laid out to dry.
God bless America and its gigantic appliances.
Anyway, we slept late, and my travel companion decided that she wanted some down time — which was totally fine with me. I told her she could stay in the apartment while I wandered around.

Last Fall, I started thinking about bucket list trips. I’m not getting any younger, and I’m seeing minor blips in a formerly well-running system. I have a chronic leg injury that can make mobility a challenge on certain days. On top of that, the world is in a state where travel is becoming stickier, even amongst long-time allies.
I figured in the next five to seven years, I should focus on doing a few big trips that matter to me, the places I’d be disappointed if I didn’t get to see. That way, if a day comes when international travel isn’t a great idea for me anymore, I’ll have no regrets.
For my first of these trips, I pondered several spots, but Italy always held a huge lead. I’ve been fortunate enough to see a lot of Europe, but hadn’t yet gotten to the boot. As a solo traveler, I’ve felt intimidated to go somewhere I don’t speak the language. But Italy is a tourist mecca, so I knew they’d cater to North Americans. Plus, apps like Google Translate make that stuff less worrisome.
In real life, I’m not the kind to flock to hot, happening places. Toronto always has a cool new restaurant, but I don’t like waiting in lines and sitting elbow-to-elbow while I eat my overpriced deconstructed…

Vatican City, the smallest sovereign state in the world, is a walled enclave in the city of Rome
Rome, the capital of Italy, is a multi-faceted place. From the erstwhile Roman Empire to the present day capital of modern Italy, Rome has been among the big names in must see places in Europe. It has been in literature in the form of all time famous maxims: ‘Rome was not built in a day’, ‘While Rome was burning, Nero was playing his fiddle’ and ‘When in Rome do as the Romans do’ and on the Hollywood film scene with block busters like ‘Fall of the Roman Empire’ and ‘Roman holiday’. Roman English is also in common use. Rome is not burning any more and the infamous Nero is long gone. Unlike the Mughal and the Soviet Empires the Roman Empire re-emerged from the ashes and the Roman holiday is very much on. A trip to Italy, in this context, will be long remembered.
Far from stereotypical Mediterranean, Italy’s climate varies from place to place. We landed at Rome International Airport under a heavily overcast sky. It was actually a light drizzle that we encountered on arrival from Athens and that reminded me of a friend who had visited Rome a couple of years ago but could enjoy it only from his hotel window. He believed in the famous verse:
Aaye kuchh abr kuchh sharaab aaye
Being averse to sedentary life style and drinking, I was really worried about the impending continuity of the inclement weather in the next few days. Though the sun remained under the cloud cover during most of our stay in Italy, to our good luck, the rain did not disrupt our programme any further and we moved around at will.
A Republic since 1946, Italy consists of the mainland Italian peninsula and two large Mediterranean islands namely Sicily and Sardinia further south and enclaves the sovereign states of Vatican and San Marino, the later, lesser known to the outside world, being the 5th smallest state both by area and population. After the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the victorious Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II was the first of the rulers of the Ottoman Empire to assume the title ‘Caesar of the Roman Empire’.
We had planned a trip to about half a dozen European destinations in slightly less than four weeks time and had to budget-plan our outings. A friend very kindly handed me a book ‘Europe 20 Dollars a day’ (It was an old addition, the latest being Europe 50 Dollars a day) and this book really proved very handy with the minutest of the travel details and tips. We booked a place in a pension, French style boarding house, at competitive rates, on the National Street, mid way between the city centre and the Rome railway station. There could not have been a better location to see the historic city.
Sprawling over seven hills, the city of Rome has River Tiber flowing through the city centre. Incidentally most of the heritage sites were located close to where we were staying and when the tour operators gave a strike call, on the fateful day we had reserved for the city tour, we made good use of the book mentioned earlier. Taxis with English speaking cabbies were very expensive so we used public transport for site seeing. The bus tickets were not sold on board but had to be purchased from the ‘T’ shops (tobacco shops) in the side streets. Language being a big barrier I was fooling around looking for the ‘T’ shop when an Italian lady came to our rescue. Attracted to my wife’s Pakistani dress she told us that her spouse was from Bangladesh and offered any possible help which we gratefully accepted. Her guidance was of extreme help and from then on we went around the metropolis with utmost ease.
Piazza Venezia, the main city square, and former dictator Mussolini’s official quarters were just fifteen minutes walk from the National street. It was where Poet of the East Allama Iqbal had met the then strongman on his European tour. There were three concrete maps drawn on a wall near this imposing building and they showed the expanse of the Roman Empire in three different eras. It looked as if half of the world, at one point, was under the Roman rule. What a glorious past? Coliseum, the largest amphitheatre in Europe which could accommodate around 50000 spectators, was close by and a monument to see. Trevi fountain, frequented by the tourists in colossal numbers, is a place where one could wish, by throwing a coin into the water, for anything, except the proverbial free ride horses (for the beggars to ride). There were a large number of coins shining in the water on the floor of the fountain, each showing somebody’s secret wish. Following the tradition we too wished for the moon and got rid of some coins in the process.
Walking on a footpath one fine morning in the city centre we heard police cars with screeching tires and blowing sirens and assumed that some film shooting was going on. It was only the following day we came to know that some outlaws were being chased by the law enforcing agencies and a German tourist was killed in the cross fire. It was really hard to digest that such things could happen in a European capital in broad day light.
Vatican City, the smallest sovereign state in the world spread over an area of 44 hectare (108.7 acres), is a walled enclave in the city of Rome. It houses St. Peter’s church and Papacy. Created in 1929 the papal city state has its own postal services, a heliport, radio station and a publishing house. It issues its own coins though, like in Italy, Euro has replaced the age old Lira. Its population is just over 800 persons but millions of visitors throng the place every year. Vatican has the highest per capita crime rate in the world including purse snatching and pick -pocketing. At the church entrance it was interesting to see a notice reading; ‘Please cover your legs and heads before entering’. Such rules always sanctify the place.
Pisa was our next destination. We undertook a four hour long train journey to the city of the famous tower through the picturesque landscape with the Mediterranean Sea on one side and vast fruit orchards on the other. Large motor car carriers were seen plying in large numbers on the express way with locally manufactured cars loaded on them in tiers. We took a bus from the railway station to the leaning marble structure which is a free standing bell tower of the cathedral of the city of Pisa that would have collapsed long ago had it not been for the support of the millions of visitors who get themselves photographed with the tower as if they were preventing it from crumbling to the ground. We too did our bit towards supporting the sinking monument and took photographs as a testimony. I once saw a cartoon in the famous Punch magazine which showed the under construction (then vertical) tower of Pisa with scaffoldings all around and the architect telling his colleague: “There is a small defect in the foundation but rest assured nobody is ever going to notice it”. Fifty-six meters high, this 12th century building leans at an angle of just 5.5 degrees but at the top it measures 4.5 m from where it used to stand vertically.
Historically Galileo did his experiments by dropping two cannon balls from the top of the leaning tower to augment his theory of speed vs. mass, the Nazis used it as an observation post during WW II and Mussolini ordered it to be returned to its normal vertical position albeit without success. In 1964 the Italian government decided to keep the tilt for the promotion of tourism and kept it closed for the visitors for almost a decade to reinforce its foundations from sinking further. The heavy bells, seven in number, were removed to shed the extra load and it was declared stable for another 300 years.
The vehicular traffic in Pisa was somewhat more disciplined than that of Rome. An article in the Readers Digest titled ‘Driving Italian style’ eulogized that driving reflected the character of a nation and the painting supporting the article was no different than the one we see every day in our motherland except that the vehicles on the roads in Rome were cent per cent mechanized, unlike Pakistan where stone age animal driven carts are still plying side by side with the modern automotives. The city fathers in Rome are trying to device ways to overcome the traffic congestion and parking problems by disallowing the unauthorized traffic from the central part of the city during work days from 6 am to 6 p.m. We in Pakistan too will have to think of sorting this problem out sooner than later.
Latin, the original language of the Empire, was changed to Italian in the middle ages. Italian is a confluence of various regional dialects and in that respect has some theoretical semblance with Urdu, which itself is a conglomerate of different expressions. The Islamic community has grown significantly since the ‘not very distant’ past due to immigration from North Africa and the Middle Eastern countries and Rome can boast of the largest mosque in Europe built in 1995. We also came across Arab vendors selling their merchandize, especially semi precious stones, on the foot paths in Rome. The string of these multi coloured gems lent further hue to the already colourful side walks.
Our memorable trip to the historic city came to a close and we boarded Alitalia for Orly international Airport, Paris.

Rome is the place where you need to get lost! The city that’s full of surprises, history, charm, and colors. Put away your map, and roam around the historic center of Rome to discover beauties, that you couldn’t imagine! That’s the only way to really experience the eternal city, and the beautiful streets to see in Rome!
Even if you’ve been in Rome, you’ve never actually seen Rome if you didn’t get lost on those colorful cobbled streets. That’s a fact! After 9 visits, I can tell you, that I still didn’t see it all! And believe me, I’ve spent way too many hours roaming around already! Let’s see now some highlights!
Via della Reginella & Via dei Pastini
Those incredible little streets are one of the many reasons I love the Italian capital so much! It’s all about experiencing, breathing it in, enjoying it. Rome is not the place where you should be running with a tourist bus around. Rome is the city that you have to experience, to feel!
As simple as that. This is also the reason why each blogger and travel expert is suggesting to WALK when you’re visiting Rome! There’s so much more than the main landmarks, so much more hidden beauty!
This is very common in many big cities… to not have the opportunity for any memorable street experience. But Rome, Rome has the most beautiful streets to wander around for as many hours as you can!
If you’re a frequent visitor on my blog or my Instagram, you may already know that I have an obsession with colorful streets… Well, that obsession started in 2015 here, in the Eternal city!
Via del Governo Vecchio is the street where I spend most of my time when I’m in Rome. I discovered it back in 2015, and ever since that, this is my favorite street in Rome! Via del Governo Vecchio runs from Piazza Navona almost to the Castel San Angelo, parallel with the main street of Corso Vittorio Emmanuele II.
My favorite bar, the Bistro and Wine Bar Pasquino, and one of my fav restaurants, the Ristorante Pasquino is located on this street. They are both steps away from Piazza Navona. Also, one of the best gelaterias (ice cream shops) called Ice cRome is located right opposite these restaurants. Besides the charm, that really Italian narrow, cobbled street vibe, the buildings are beautiful as well!
Via del Governo Vecchio also offers a variety of bars, restaurants, shops, more gelaterias, art galleries, and antiquity stores all along the way! There’s no way to not find something you like on this street!
Find details about this area, Piazza Navona and it’s a neighborhood in my previous article: BEST NEIGHBOURHOODS IN ROME: NAVONA
Each big city has its fashion street where you can find all the famous luxury brands. In Rome, this street is called Via dei Condotti. A street linking Via del Corso with Piazza di Spagna, where you can find the famous Spanish Steps.
If you’re heading from Via del Corso through Via dei Condotti, you’ll gain an amazing view of the Spanish Steps and the church of Trinita dei Monti. So even if you’re not interested in shopping, or admiring the shopfronts, this view is worth a walk through Via dei Condotti!
Via Condotti features all the famous Italian brands like Armani, BVLGARI, Versace, and Prada. Though, you will find others like Chanel, Luis Vuitton, Swarowski, or Cartier to. When I’ve first walked down this street I was still at university. That day I’ve promised myself, that if once I’ll buy a luxury item, I will do it on this street! Still preparing for that…
Via del Moro & Via della Pelliccia
Trastevere is my second favorite neighborhood in Rome after the Navona neighborhood! It is located south of the Vatican city, near the Tevere river. One of those things I love the most in this area is the streets. Colorful, cozy, vibrant, and VERY ITALIAN. You’re bumping into traditional bars and restaurants on every step, literally! Colorful buildings, the flowers, the cobblestone roads… it’s just enchanting and fascinating.
Vicolo Moroni
In the past two years, I’ve been always booking my hostels/hotels/b&bs in Trastevere. One of my favorite places, while I was traveling alone, was the Orsa Maggiore Hostel for Woman Only. There’s nothing better than going out in the morning for a cappuccino and having it in such a beautiful atmosphere!
Trastevere is a bit outside the center of the city, which explains why is still much more traditional, and Roman, than other sides of the historic center. For a real Italian experience in Rome, definitely try to stroll around the streets of Trastevere!
Via Margutta runs between Piazza di Spagna and Piazza del Popolo. It’s a more hidden street, but with Google Maps you’ll find it easily. Originally, Via Margutta was home to various stables and workshops. It changed its face in the 20th century though!
It became famous after the premiere of the Roman Holiday movie. As you may know, Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) in the movie was living on this street of Rome, on Via Margutta. Thanks to the success of the Roman Holiday movie, many famous people moved here afterward.
This is how the neighborhood slowly became an exclusive, really expensive neighborhood in Rome. Today Via Margutta is hosting numerous art galleries, luxury shops, and restaurants. The neighborhood is still the residence of a wealthier layer of Romans.
This street goes parallel with the Tevere river in the historic center of Rome. It’s really close to Piazza Navona, Corso Vittorio Emmanuele II, and Campo di Fiori. Via Giulia was one of the first projects of Renaissance Rome. The street was designed by Bramante, who at the same time was working on the St Peter’s Basilica.
The street links the Ponte Sisto Bridge with the San Giovanni di Fiorentini church. Back in the 16th century, it was Rome’s most fashionable street, where merchants and bankers lived. It’s still considered a really elegant side of Rome, though it looks like it’s not as popular as a couple of years ago. Via Giulia, the past decades was really popular for its antiquities and fashion boutiques, but today you won’t find many of these open.
However, this street of Rome is still considered significant because of the amazing renaissance artist, Michelangelo! He had a plan to connect the Palazzo Farnese which can be found on this street, to the Farnese Villa in the Trastevere district. You can still see this arch leaning over Via Giulia on its southern end.
Vicolo del Malpasso & Vicolo della Scimia
Some of my favorite hidden streets are in the neighborhood of Campo di Fiori. As this side of the Corso Vittorio Emmanuele is not that overwhelmed with visitors, the streets are much nicer, calmer, charming. As I was staying mostly in the Trastevere neighborhood, the easiest way to get there was always through the cobbled streets. This is how I discovered both Vicolo del Malpasso and Vicolo della Scimia between many others!
Vicolo della Scimia got burned into my brain because I had to pass through it every single time I was going to or from the historic center of Rome. This one street couldn’t be replaced with another, and I was always freaking out on it. Don’t worry, it’s a safe street! Otherwise, I wouldn’t be suggesting seeing it!
The reason I was freaking out, because I’m terribly afraid of rats, and Rome has a great population of them. On this vicolo, there’s no place to go right or left, and it has no doors. So you get on it on one side of the palazzo block and you get out on the other side. So I was always stressed out, that what if a huge rat will walk against me?!? Where I’m going to run? What if one walks onto the street from one side and the other from the other side? I can’t escape!!! Of course, that never happened, but when someone’s this terrified, our brain can play with us a lot.
So, don’t worry, just put away your map, and head on to explore the streets of Rome. Discover the magic, find the hidden gems, and just breathe the atmosphere in. Rome has unbelievable magic, that you need to experience yourself!

“You packed what for Rome in March?”
That was the customs officer, eyeing my linen jumpsuit and flip-flops as if I’d just stepped off a cruise ship in the Arctic. To be fair, I thought March in Italy meant early spring. Blossom-scented breezes. Aperol spritzes under the sun. The Colosseum is adorned with charming gowns.
Instead, I stepped into what felt like a chilly Roman version of Seattle. The wind whipped through my bones. Locals wrapped themselves in puffer jackets and scarves. And there I was, dragging my tiny carry-on and an overinflated ego through cobblestone streets in socks that were basically social distancing from warmth.
Let me save you the frostbite. Here’s what I wish someone had told me before that first trip.
Italy in March sounds like a dream: off-season travel, fewer crowds, blooming landscapes, cheaper everything. And yes, that part is true.
But what your dreamy Pinterest boards don’t tell you? March in Italy is moody. One moment you find yourself soaking up the golden sunlight on the Spanish Steps, and the next, you find yourself sprinting through an unexpected downpour. The weather changes its mind more often…

I have said this many times before and will say it again- Rome is my favorite city in the world. Why? Because it’s the perfect blend of history and the modern world. It has it all- beautiful historical sites, amazing shops and of course; the perfect pizzas ever.
So here’s my experience of Rome and why it’s soo awesome:
Italian hospitality is unbeatable. The Italians treat you like long lost buddies right from the moment you first meet. The hotel staff are extra nice and attend to your complaints within seconds. But the best about Italians is the way they speak. Their language comes out like a sweet song. It so adorbs that I wouldn’t be able to guess even if they were swearing at me.
If you think you have eaten the best Italian food ever in your own countries, you’re gravely mistaken my friend. The best Italian food comes from the source…which would be Italy in this case (well obviously). These Italian restaurants/cafe’s serve the most scrumptious ravioli, epic mouth-watering risottos and pizzas to die for. I would make a trip back to Rome simply for the food if I could.
Rome’s history is divided into two parts. The Roman Empire and Medieval history. The architecture of each era is spread out into two distinct areas. The walk to the Colosseum is one of the most enchanting walks I have ever taken. There are ancient relics on either side of the pathway adding to the charm. The Medieval historical sites give off a very “Game of Thrones” vibe.
This mini-city on its own would make a trip to Rome worth-it. The Vatican some of the most beautiful frescos ever in the Sistine Chapel. You will find hundreds of tour guides right outside the Vatican who will give you a tour of the church and museum. Just make sure that you don’t get ripped off!
Milan is technically a major fashion capital but Rome isn’t far behind. The shopping here is marvelous from boutique brands to mainstream brands. There’s a Zara store that’s four stories high (I spent around two hours there I think). After a day of hard-core shopping you can relax in a nice spot, having street-made square pizzas and watch the sun setting over the beautiful historical ruins. Bliss!
Fun Fact: The Trevi Fountain– a must see site- has magical powers. Apparently whoever puts a coin in there is sure to come back to Rome one day. My mom put the coin twice and has visited Rome twice ever since. I put it as well and I sure do hope to go again someday!

Disclaimer: This is just a travel report. I won’t go into depth about statistics and politics.
As a French-born person. The rivalry between Italy and France has always been present in my mind.
Especially in 2006 when the Italians stole the Football World Cup (according to the French people at least).
And throughout education and media, a feeling of superiority is disseminated to the French nation:
Always look up to the Germans. Always look down on the Italians.
The Italians are also often called “Ritals”
Paris feels less safe. For instance, there are people at the airport trying to grab your suitcase and put it in their taxis so you feel obliged (threatened?) to use their services. I’ve lived this experience in Paris. But not in Rome.
The Roman transportation system and airports are less stressful. Speakers do not blast reminders every 30 seconds about pickpockets, C0vid rules, baggage security rules, etc. It is much more relaxing.

“All roads lead to Rome” — Romans have built one of the most sophisticated road networks, and all of them ended in the heart of the Empire — the City of Rome. I’ve cheated and took a plane, but eventually made it to one of the most interesting cities in the world.
“All roads lead to Rome” — you’ve heard this expression before. Maybe in the history class, maybe in the tourist guide. It comes from Roman Empire times. Back then, they built one of the most sophisticated road networks, and all of the roads led to the heart of the Empire — the City of Rome. I’ve cheated and took a plane, but eventually made it to one of the most interesting cities in the world.
There are two main reasons why you want to visit Rome: history and food. Guilty as charged, I have a soft spot in my heart for both of them. Growing up I have read numerous books on the history of Ancient Rome and have always been drawn to it. Romans made a huge contribution to our everyday lives: their political, economic, cultural and social norms had set the precedence for quite a lot of ways in which our modern society works. Food is amazing and available pretty much everywhere.
Also moving forward I will start to feature some music from the country I’ve visited to set your mood while you are reading the blog. The first are italo disco heroes Marvin & Guy.
When you start planning your trip, keep in mind that you will be walking a lot. Most attractions and sights are fairly close to each other and easily accessible by foot. Although Rome has public transportation and taxis/ridesharing services, I would recommend staying in central areas and just walk around. There is nothing like getting lost in the small ancient cobblestone streets of Rome… well, as long as you have comfortable shoes ;)
With that in mind I’ve ended up choosing the hotel in the Prati neighborhood, which is located halfway between the Vatican and Historic Center. I didn’t want to be in the midst of touristy areas but still appreciated an easy access to all sights. It worked out perfectly. I would also recommend Trastevere for good nightlife. Otherwise, most areas in Historic Center will provide you with numerous accommodation options. The only exception is the area around Termini — city’s main train and bus station, it seems to have a bad reputation.
Rome has 2 international airports but you most likely will arrive at Fiumicino Airport (FCO). It is the largest airport in Rome and Italy. Technically its official name is Aeroporto Leonardo da Vinci. From there you can take an express train or bus to Termini station, the ride will take you about 30–40 mins. I’ve chosen to take a bus because it had a stop near Vatican about 5 mins away from my hotel. I was advised against taking a taxi from the airport since they tend to overcharge tourists regardless of the mandated fixed fee. Unfortunately, you can’t order Uber from airport. In general Uber allowed in the city but only for premium cars/vans. If you want a regular UberX/Lyft experience, download MyTaxi app.
Start your trip from Colosseum. It is an amphitheater built in Ancient Rome times, which used to hold 50,000 spectators. Throughout times it was modernized, rebuilt and upgraded, all the while remaining a world-famous landmark. It hosted gladiator fights, animal hunts, mock sea battles, and executions. Colosseum is the symbol of Imperial Rome and one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.
Because of its popularity, it’s a major tourist trap. If walking around as a part of the crowd where everybody is trying to take a picture of every stone is not your thing, play smart. Rule #1: buy the ticket in advance here, the same ticket will get you to the Colosseum, Forum and Palatine Hill — all while avoiding the ticket line. Rule#2: get there super early and ideally on the workday, drink espresso in the morning (we’ll come back to that) and head over right away. You goal is to be done with all of this by early afternoon and switch to drinking Aperol Spritz somewhere.
Roman Forum is the plaza in the center of Rome next to Colosseum and Palatine Hill. Back in the days it was a center of Roman life, and now surrounded by the ruins of the several ancient government buildings. But even ruins give you an idea of the majestic importance and the spirit of the place.
Palatine Hill is one of the oldest parts of the city and the original location of imperial palaces. You can walk around the territory and learn about ancient buildings. Now remember my previous point of getting there earlier. Well, we didn’t. For some reason we’ve decided to grab lunch after Colosseum and do the rest after. Rookie mistake. Don’t be like us. That Aperol Spritz not going to drink itself.
Actually, let’s talk about Aperol, Campari and all other good stuff. Italians have a strong culture of aperitifs — drinks served before the meal. Aperol is an orange liquor, and Campari is a blood orange liqueur. Both are very popular aperitifs and bases for popular aperitif cocktails: Aperol Spritz (Aperol+Prosecco+club soda) and Americano (Campari+sweet vermouth+club soda) respectively. Needless to say, there’s nothing better than sipping one (or more) of them on a warm sunny day while enjoying the view after some touristy activities. Mark my words. You’re welcome.
Finish the walk at Piazza Venezia — the home of Vittorio Emanuele II Monument. It is a monument built in honor of the first king of unified Italy in 1919. It is one of the most amazing Roman buildings and just a colossal piece of architecture, which simply hypnotizes you. That’s probably one of the reasons Mussolini used it as a place for the military parades and public speeches.
It is the second day and you’re a bit tired from walking yesterday (or drinking last night), so you need a little pick me up. Now let’s pause here for a second. Coffee is somewhat a religion in Italy, and they take it seriously. There are also some rules, which you might consider even weird, but it’s their country and their rules. Rule #1: cappuccino (and other milk espresso-based drinks) or espressos with some pastry (croissant) in the mornings, only espressos in the afternoons. Rule #2: you order coffee at the bar and drink it quickly while standing. There is also the specific way to order it: you pay first, then take your receipt to the barista, who then will make it for you. Now you’re not the first foreigner who visited Italy, and most likely you will be near the major touristy area. So, nobody will really care, if you sit down in the afternoon with a cup of latte. But it’s generally a good idea to be aware of the local customs, so you don’t look like a complete idiot in their eyes.
Once you’re energized and ready to do, start from Piazza Navona. It a famous square of three fountains: Fontana del Moro, Fountain of Neptune and Fountain of Four Rivers. You would probably recognize them from various movies or famous photos.
Your next stop is The Pantheon. It’s a former Roman temple turned to church. It’s one of the best preserved Ancient Roman buildings because of its extensive use over the years. Interesting fact: its ceiling is done in the form of a dome, and till this day its world’s largest unreinforced concrete dome, and of course there are rumors of gods helping out there.
The Trevi Fountain is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and another world-famous piece of architecture. Rumor has it, you have to drink a glass of water out of it in order to come back to Rome. Today you’ll have to put some work in to get to it through the crowd of tourists. If you do so, there’s a pretty good chance that you’ll come back.
The Spanish Steps is another iconic sight, which was originally built to connect Spanish embassy with the church on top of the hill. By then you are probably a little tired and want to sit down, relax and eat gelato. Steps sound like a perfect place to do it. Wrong. The majority of the people sitting on the steps are tourists. Italians are not huge fans of sitting on the historical monument. Recently they’ve passed a law that allows police to give out tickets up to 400 euros to ppl sitting there. It might be a very expensive gelato after all. If you’re still full of energy you can walk up to Villa Borghese Gardens, which is a public park on top of the hill.
Vatican is an independent city-state within Rome borders. It’s the smallest sovereign state in the world by area and population, and primarily exists under the governance of the Catholic Church. Again, follow the rule: sightseeing in the morning, relaxing in the afternoon. Beat the crowds by arriving earlier. Vatican’s main sights are St. Peter’s Basilica, the Sistine Chapel and Vatican Museums.
St. Peter’s Basilica is the largest church in the world and one of the holiest Catholic shrines. The entrance is free, but if you want to go up to its top and enjoy the amazing view, you’ll have to join the separate dome line and pay the fee. The Sistine Chapel is the official residence of Pope in Vatican City. The Vatican Museums are Christian art museums, which display works collected by popes over the years.
From Vatican walk to Castel Sant’Angelo. It’s cylindrical building on the right bank of the Tiber. It was originally built as a mausoleum and later used as a fortress or castle. Inside there’s a museum and you can also go to its roof and grab a bite while enjoying the view.
While doing all of the discussed sightseeing, you should not forget the second reason why you are in Rome: food. You will see it everywhere. The rule of thumb: if you see a lot of tourist crowds, do not buy food there. Walk a couple of blocks, look where locals eat. Also embrace carbs, carbs, carbs.
Several dishes you should absolutely try in Rome:
Generally, I would recommend to explore Trastevere neighborhood, which is famous for its nightlife: restaurants and bars.
Ciao!

Mille viae ducunt homines per saecula Romam
(A thousand roads lead men forever to Rome)
– Proverb.
I have been reading and hearing much about population decline in the last months — except for Israel. India takes over from China as the largest population, since it is less urbanized. Homes are found empty in Japan for years now. Predictions are made for war and growth with a declining population. Schools are shut with no students. And there lies the prophecy of Universe 25.
For those of you who do not know, Universe 25 is the 25th iteration of a behavioural study on rodents. The premise was simples: you have some rats in a utopia designed to feed and house then to perfection, no luxury spared. Having reached 2200 mice, the population founds its way to decline in less than 2 years, and it eventually completely died out.
For those who observe the unprecedented prosperity humanity has reached, Universe 25 may seem like a Morgana’s prophecy: “he is your destiny, and he is your doom”. Thankfully, we are far more complex than mice, we are not confined in an experimental setting (unless you count the planet as confined, while we do not even know the whole of it yet) and we have a knack for developing — our not-so-utopia was not handed down to us by some ET.
I would submit we have far too many differences, and though we may share in a certain decline, the history of humanity is lined with ascent and descent: empires, tribes, families, armies and much more. And as I could not keep out of everything… this has everything to do with Ancient Rome. As a matter of fact, I continue to agree and expand on prof. Oliveira Martins’ quote (translated from Portuguese): “the history of the Roman Republic is the paradigm of all known histories”. Though I would say: the history of Ancient Roman is the known paradigm of all known histories. And in that I mean the empire, the republic, the kingdom, the city, the economy, the politics, the rivalries, and everything else.
And, in this too, Rome has already declined and mostly faded, buried under the sands of time; the city has suffered an unprecedented demographic collapse from the height of what could have been a hugely dense 1.5 million people metropolis[*] by the year 100 A.D. to a few tens of thousands by the start of the Middle Ages. Adding the Western Roman Empire’s downfall to external conquest and the Byzantine slow, thousand-year, decline: one can only say the answers also lie in Rome.
When we talk about the ancient city of Rome, it is difficult to know exactly what we are talking about. That is, the city changed so much from the kings to Odoacer that one would. Are we talking about the near-empty thatched huts before the Sabine women, are we talking about unprecedented marvels of marble and stone from all over the Mediterranean or are we talking about the mythical decadent figure bestowed unto us by artists and thinkers from the Renascence onward?
Well, we are talking about all of that, of course, but we cannot properly talk about all of that at the same time, lest we lose chronological sense.
Keeping that in mind, let us be orderly and start at the beginning. Rome would not look like a booming metropolis at the time of the kings. It had not sprawled over the seven hills, it had no Egyptian grain to distribute, no treasures of the mysterious East and none of the major marks (the Flavian Theatre, the Thermæ, the temples built by the greatest generals and so on). We are talking about a civilisation that is, in sooth, yet to be — though now we know it indeed was.
We may consider that the challenge posed to the Roman Kingdom and most of the republican times was there. A mission existed, be it to overcome Carthage, to attain general success or to rule the Sea. What I mean is: there is no place here for a weak, young society to ever act like a decadent empire. The opposite, in fact. There lies no path to power in imitating power. Brazil is an example of such a failure in our times: a country that looks up to “Scandinavian socialism”[†] and seeks to spend just like Sweden, while providing zero of the ambiance that gave way to Swedish prosperity — and we are not talking about an empire here. Needless to say, Brazil is not in the highway to prosperity, but threading the dangerous road to serfdom.
At any point, the fact is Rome stood far from the spoiling utopia of Universe 25 at this moment of its history.
After the fall of Carthage, we might say Rome has become the leading empire of its time, and of all time, we might add. That is, taking on the mantle of the cosmopolis, Rome is the universal empire that weaves the very legitimacy of the concept. And it did enjoy its time in the Sun, much like the USA after World War Two. Using the population of the actual city of Rome as a proxy, we must note that the population seems to have peaked by the end of the first century A.D., according to some estimations.
The precise movements of Roman prosperity are yet not detailed to be discussed, and are also not the main point of this essay, so here comes the question: what happened after that? Well, my readings indicate that the population fell just as quickly as it grew. It is important to observe that this was not a childless society. Romans died from plague and war; they moved back to the rural areas as Rome was politically and economically voided — and it would be possible that those who remained had less children, but who knows.
The point is: the urban population fell, and by the end of Antiquity, many estimates agree that it would not have even a hundred thousand people — and that it would continue to dim well into Medieval Times. We are talking here about a much more dangerous city, abandoned by the imperial structure, lacking a Senatorial class (or any such wealthy people who could turn anywhere they went into Monaco), partially abandoned and materially depreciating. This is no city of wonders, commerce, and opportunity. It is a hollow dream, voided by the decay and overextension of empire.
And for more than a thousand years, Rome would remain the seat of the papacy, de facto and de jure a Christian City (identified more by the Church than with the Byzantines over the Adriatic), mostly reduced to minor Italian squabbles, and depending on greater kingdoms to call upon its influence.
It is no mystery what the ancient Romans did: they fled to their farms. Large and small, senator or bum, the wandering search of safety, shelter and a life led the Romans to the countryside — and led properties to the hand of powerful men, who could defend the land/fiefs and the previous owners, now their servants or vassals. One might take note of the wording, but it is better to say it fully: feudalism had kicked down the door.
It is thus that some questions arise:
i. What was happening to population and fertility when feudalism began?
ii. Did moving away from Rome make less babies or more?
iii. How relevant was the barbarian influx?
iv. How and why did things change again?
One might observe that these are not trivial questions. To answer them accurately would require precise data from more than a thousand years ago, and we do not have that. In many ways, that may be a problem since the absence of this information makes way for all sort of fantasy storytelling, but let us propose some thoughts:
It is likely that fertility fell by the end of Antiquity, as that trend is observed for general times of crises, but it is unclear if that had any meaningful role to play in the social or economic setting. We know, as an example, that individual wealth grew at the time of the Black Death, since it led to concentration of inheritance and the scarcity of labour. It would be interesting to see how that would have worked out a thousand years prior. It is also not clear if there was a difference in urban and rural fertility, as there exists nowadays.
[*] 1.5 million people is the highest number found during my research on the topic, but I am not subscribing to that number, just using it as a reference for the scale of the collapse.
[†] It is unfortunately the case for Brazilian politics, that the Marxist/socialist left (allied to Maduro, Cuba, Ortega, …) conflates the Scandinavian political and economic setting with “socialism that works”, at the same time using the ludicrous claim that the USSR, Cambodia, and other such bloodthirsty regimes were not “real socialism” (at best, there are times when we can hear people defending gulags or saying they never existed in the first place). We should observe that such claims have been publicly refuted not only by simple facts, but also by Scandinavian leaders, but referring more commonly to claims made by American politicians: <https://www.vox.com/2015/10/31/9650030/denmark-prime-minister-bernie-sanders>
P.S.: the above is an informal essay, please do not consider it conclusive, fully researched or based.

When I was a kid I watched a movie called “Roman Holiday”. The magnificent and enchanting scenery shown in the film evoked my longing for Rome.
Years later, I had the opportunity to visit the “Eternal City” (with more than 2500 years of history). It was 2003, and my husband and I decided to take a week-long vacation to Rome.
As with my other travel stories, here I will continue to talk about some of the little things I observed and experienced in Rome.
1. The airport bus couldn’t open its door and a ‘free’ subway ride
One afternoon in March, we took off from Düsseldorf, Germany, with our infant son, and arrived at Rome’s Fiumicino airport about two hours later.
March is the best season in Rome, the weather is neither cold nor hot. We came from still chilly Germany to warm Rome and felt comfortable. But soon we were overwhelmed by what happened next.
After waiting at the airport for a long time, the bus to the city finally arrived. Before we could react, the crowd swarmed and filled the bus in an instant.
Oddly, the middle door of the bus wouldn’t open, so our pram had to squeeze in through the narrow front door.

If you only have a few days in Rome, as I did, it’s important to see as much history and culture as possible. In our last post, we showed you our ideal day in the heart of Rome, Piazza Novona — the best espresso (according to Romans) , gelato, markets, and the Pantheon. In bite-size pieces, here’s our version of the best things to do in Rome in 48 hours.
I. Piazza della Repubblica: Piazza della Repubblica is a beautiful semi-circullar piazza with the Fountain of the Naiads in the center, and the Basilica of St. Mary of the Angels and Martyrs across from the fountain. I encourage you to look inside the Basilica, inside is a beautiful bronze meridian solar line, designed by Francesco Bianchini, with marble depictions of the zodiacs.
II. The Colosseum — because no trip to Roma is complete without visiting the Colosseum, the icon of Imperial Rome. Right next door to the Colosseum is the Roman Forum, the heart of ancient Rome. Both ruins are must see when visiting Rome, and you can purchase the Roma Pass, which gives free entry to both the Forum and the Colosseum.
III. The Spanish Steps (or the walk to the Spanish Steps): The Spanish Steps is a monumental set of 135 steps, made famous by the 1953 classic Roman Holiday, with Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck. The base of the steps can be overcrowded with tourists, so I suggest arriving north of the steps by Via Sistina and taking the time to visit the shops along the way, and admire the charming architecture of the streets of Rome.
IV. Villa Borghese: Villa Borghese is an extensive garden that was built in 1605 by Cardinal Borghese as a party villa. It has many villas built as summer residences for Popes and nobles, but is now most visited for the Galleria Borghese, which has sculptures by Bernini, and paintings by Raphael and Caravaggio. Buy tickets in advance because this is a popular museum, and aside from the Vatican, contains some of the best works in Rome. If you don’t make it to the museum, or want to spend an extra hour or so exploring the park, there is much to see, such as the Sienna Square, National Gallery of Modern Art, or the Temple of Aesculapius. My favorite part of the park was the view from the Villa Medici. which offers stunning panoramic views of Rome (above).
V. Vatican City: The Vatican can be made a half-day trip or a whole day excursion. There is so much art in the Vatican Museums, and because of the amount of tourists, I recommend allotting quite a few hours to see all the art the Vatican has to offer. There are four Sculpture Museums, a Painting Collection, a museum of Modern Religious Art, and a historical museum and art gallery. The Vatican’s extensive art collection started over 500 years ago with the purchase of Laocoon and his Sons, a marble sculpture found in a vineyard near the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome. The Sistine Chapel cannot be missed, I could spend hours looking up at the masterpiece of a ceiling, Michelangelo’s greatest work. The heart of the Vatican is St. Peter’s Basilica, one of the world’s largest churches, and the most renowned work of Renaissance architecture. Words cannot even describe the magnificence of St. Peter’s Basilica, and you must see Michelangelo’s Pieta located inside the Basilica.

When I travel, I like to seek out authentic local experiences. This time someone heard my prayers and decided to give me one of the most classic local southern European experiences ever on my first day — a public transportation strike. So I walked everywhere.
First impressions:The area around the train station was pretty gritty, there was graffiti on every vertical surface, litter all over the ground, and…sketchy people standing around. But this is pretty standard around big train stations everywhere in the world, Paris North Station is also similar, but Rome definitely outperforms Paris in terms of grittiness. Unlike the perfectly manicured buildings in Paris, Rome feels more “wild” and unrestrained.
Roman traffic deepened such an impression. Walking on a large boulevard, I reached a roundabout where many large roads met. In the middle of the road, there was a small police stop, with two middle-aged Italian policewomen directing traffic. They were doing a good job, but they were a little…unpredictable. Literally in the middle of a green light with cars pouring onto the intersection, one of them strolled confidently into the middle of the road, and held out her hand firmly to stop traffic. The cars stopped. They were not in straight lines. Some cars backed out of the intersection. Everything was still for a moment. And then the chaos reignited. I had no idea what was going on, and to be honest I was a little bemused, but I calmly crossed the street and kept walking. Traffic in Rome is quite a comedy. Not all major intersections have traffic lights or crosswalks, but that doesn’t stop people from darting across busy traffic; and even when there are traffic lights, that doesn’t stop cars and motorbikes from sneaking across. On paper, this sounds like Paris, but I assure you it’s different. Parisian drivers don’t open the windows to shout expressively at you with both hands gesturing wildly. Rome has a more comical disorganization, it’s like a Mr. Bean who knows what he’s doing. It’s hard to explain.
“Parla inglese?” It’s been a while since I’ve been in a country where I don’t speak the local language, and I’d forgotten how frustrating but also how amusing that can be. I’d pre-booked entrance tickets to the Coliseum, Forum, and Palantine Hill to avoid waiting in long lines. I’d read the fare conditions closely, and realized that I could get in for free with my Tufts in Paris “student of Art History” ID. Since mine was a discounted ticket, I had to go to the ticket office to verify my status before going in.
At the ticket office : (original conversation, imagine strong iTaLiAn accent) - Ticket lady: You reserved a free ticket, you need pay 12 euros for the adult ticket.- Me: (confused because I’d also reserved an audio guide for 7.5 euros, but in the moment I forgot what the 7.5 euros was for, and also forgot why I got a “free” ticket) I thought I paid 7.5 euros for a ticket, why are you saying it’s free?- Ticket lady: That is for the audio guide. For the entrance fee, you need to pay 12 euros because you are not an EU citizen. You need an ID or passport.- Me : (in my mind — how do you know I’m not an EU citizen??? and then I remembered why I got discounted tickets and started taking out my Tufts in Paris Art History ID) I’m a student — - Ticket lady: (interrupting) No student ticket, only adult 12 euros.- Me: But I study art history.- Ticket lady: Architecture?- Me: No, art history.- Ticket lady: Not architecture?- Me: No, art history!- Ticket lady: Ohhh ok, ~art history~ I see, sorry but only students of architecture and history of art can get free tickets.- Me: (ready to faint — art history and history of art are the same thing!)I didn’t want to argue with her anymore so I just pressed my ID against the glass.- Ticket lady: (sees my ID that says “l’histoire de l’art”) Oh ok! Then that’s good!
Good thing I insisted and didn’t cave in to paying 12 euros, otherwise I’d have lost many gelatos and that would be very sad :(
After an afternoon, I have the impression that Rome is a little less organized and less glamorous than Paris, but with more character and personality. It’s like Paris is an elegant, uptight lady, whereas Rome is a carefree singing guitarist with tattered clothes. But this is just day 1, maybe my impressions will change after 5 days! :)

Dramatic titles for me are an art form and today we are about to talk about something with no relation to any of the cities mentioned above but points to critical moments in all. Abstract titles are my way of art and ironically they a mosaics that my mind paints.
Rome was not built in a day; this a saying that has been repeated for a long time, and will also be passed to generations as long as humanity remains. It is true, Rome as an empire has been around Before Christ and After Christ hence, it is obvious that it was not a day’s job. I think it is more important to take the principles of Roman Construction and apply them in our lives.
The senior Pastor at Life Church said something in a sermon I watched, He said “When we are born we look like our Parents, when we die we look like our choices ”. That word struck me and I who enjoy a largely sedentary lifestyle imposed on me by the nature of my career went for a much-needed walk. I live in Ajah (an area in Lagos) and I have lived here for a while now (except when I was in Uni), I have seen development occur with time and how places that would have you scared now look like a jewel.
However it was not always so, I recalled and remembered what it used to be like when I walked towards a now abandoned house, an abandoned site, and a poorly maintained sand-filled road. When I began to see these buildings and roads, got the burden to paint them with words as it cuts across various niches.
Knowledge is the most pleasant and annoying thing to have, it is a double edge sword. Ardan Labs a software company that has a training arm has a saying, “If you think it’s expensive to hire a professional, just wait until you hire an amateur” and it is true about learning, “If you think it’s expensive to train to be a professional, try ignorance”. Like every good Lawyer, I will present facts that could be misconstrued but I hope I paint pictures that will live an impression on you.
Pompei is/was a city that existed in Italy under the Roman empire that got buried under ash from an Erupted volcano called Mount Vesuvius. They thrived as a City till a threat possibly called everyone who lived in that city.
Knowledge as a double edge sword had me asking how did people come to settle around an Active Volcano. Did they have no Geophysicist, no Geologist in ancient Rome that could inform people of the threat to life? Ignorance which was not an active choice of the people of Pompeii levelled and buried an entire city.
Atlantis is presented as a lost city buried somewhere in the ocean, although scientific inquiry has presented facts that Plato’s work which mentioned Atalantis in his work Timaeus and Critias was not a total representation of life but an allegory to drive home a point. As such science concludes that Atlantis never existed. Well, I am not debating science but Intend to accept for the basis of this at Atlantis did exist.
A beautiful city that got buried as a result of earthquakes, again if Atlantis really did exist why did its people decide to settle on an Island? If they had the foresight of the future would they have settled there? I would argue and present an engineer's answer “It depends”, however, the law of averages agrees that if they settled elsewhere and the earthquake happens again the island may sink or it would not, depending on its averages (in this case the intensity of the quake).
These two cities albeit one being a farce and the other did exist, are demonstrations of how knowledge gaps are our undoing. I looked at buildings that were the houses that tickled my need to be rich and a few of them looked like the have sunk. I remember coming to Dad’s house while it was constructed and its foundation was so high. My dad imagine the height of the road ( in the future ) which I felt was nearly insane. Looking at houses around that looked like they had sank and will still sink I began to understand that an intricate part of knowledge and building (not actual buildings) with it is the ability to preempt actions, develop more knowledge and respond accordingly. Today the height of the road is at least a level higher than my Dad anticipated. There are 5 new buildings around my Dad’s house and they seem taller because of the new ground level the foundation was laid, luckily for my Folks their house did not sink or sink as much, but this ability to preempt the future or an unforeseen circumstance struck me as a key to building.
Recently I switched my work codebase from an in-route logic-dependent application to a repository pattern which was initializing access to the Database (DB) in the Repositories, that was an excellent design for me at the time, the way the DB was accessed was flawless and I felt nothing could go wrong.
There has been a sprint-like approach my team had imbibed to produce the product that had been blueprinted (designed). In this fire brigade approach, I discovered that the access to the DB was a poor decision, my ignorance of this was glaring and staring me down and I had to come up with a solution. I spent 16 hours working across two days to come up with a solution that resolves the DB via the Framework’s method. I am sure it feels like I have lost you, apologies. Enough of Tech detailed talk layered with backend remarks. My ignorance meant that if this product went live based on my decision and knowledge at the time there was going to be an epic fail.
Luckily for me, I saved the day by experimenting and drawing fact-based solutions from a source of truth (FastAPI’s documentation), my teammates attested to an uptick in performance across my system. There is a word for if that situation above got to production and I have to manage the such situation and resolve it. It is called Technical debt. The lack of knowledge with regards to something intricate means that we would not deliver at the optimal mark in that regard.
A lot is happening across the world, the more we look the more we see that no one really has it all figured out, communities, countries, sports teams, people and automated processes. Knowledge is not a destination it is a continuous place. Knowledge is the refiner's fire, through its acquisition we realize how flawed our previous implementations are.
We do this by becoming like Rome.
Rome seems to be a wonder of the world, because, at some point in our lives, we hear Rome was not built in a day to persuade us to do the work. The idea however is to communicate to us the Kaizenic nature of Rome’s Architecture. There are Ancient structures that are still up today, such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and the Roman amphitheatre among a few which I know.
These structures are borne out of a place of improvement, the first structure architects would design would give them the cringe if they look at it after years of practice and work, this is why tech solutions are versioned, and this is why we have a Corolla 1998 and 2023 version. It is the Kaizenic nature of constant improvement, this motion is borne out of a place of constant reflection and a zest for the better.
This is why Veterans in any field are better than young blood, this is why the best coaches are people who actively did what they are coaching about (Albeit not at the grandest of stages).
The Roman buildings and the empire did not take over the whole world in one day, it was a gradual continuous action that became the empire. Some battles, some wars, some years of peace. History’s recounts are always fast and opaquely divulging to the perspective of time and timing. A good example as we ride out on the last strokes of this art, are football players.
A lot of these players dedicate their lives to this sport, childhood, teenage, and even their youth, why will Haland not be a deadly striker? Why will he also not lose a penalty, how come he could he can easily move on.
Time is an important perspective to everything including knowledge, I hated balancing chemical equations in secondary school but I loved it in the early years of Uni.
The most important thing these buildings have thought me is if we are not dead yet then we can become better, your next project should be better than the previous one, that is the only way to show growth and become Rome.
When we are born we are like our parents, but in death, we are our choices. I live you with a wise word on life, we will always have regrets in life, these are an opportunity cost of opportunities forgone. The rule is to remember regret is a feature of life, not a Bug.
Till next time.

Before I begin, I would like you to know how why I am sharing this information with you, since each author has their purpose and I am sure that you are curious about mine. Why should you believe me, an American girl still in high school? For starters, I am not tied to any organization and I am not trying to sell you anything. I am not only writing this to make your trip planning easier, but I am also writing this for myself. I have also added my own personal experience to guide you. I hope that while recording my own memories, I can aid you in planning your trip to Rome so you can have the best experience.
Most people visit Rome in the summer months when the blazing sun illuminates the historical center. My family (of four) decided to avoid the crowds and fly to the city in late December. I was tasked with the most time-consuming but also the most important job: creating the itinerary. My job consisted of booking reservations for the famed Colosseum and Vatican Museums, finding small gelato shops and fancy restaurants, and locating more authentic Italian respites.
The biggest downside was that there wasn’t much information about what Rome was like in the winter so we didn’t know what clothes to pack. According to the weather predictors, the sun set around 5:45 pm which was very early. Also, the temperature ranged from 35°F to 60°F. We weren’t sure about how to dress; should we wear t-shirts? Coats? We honestly had to improvise, so we packed a bit of everything.
Now, when I was trying to plan the trip out, I did not have such a wealth of information in one place. Even more annoying, many of the websites I found were advertising tickets much more expensive than the actual ones. I spent many hours on TripAdvisor, browsing through the many forums. It was difficult to find truly unbiased information. In total, I spent many hours on hundreds of websites trying to figure out how to best visit Rome and what to know about customs in Italy. Of course, there wasn’t information about everything, so we ended up learning a lot of lessons from our unexpected encounters.
I also had a tough time with scheduling. While researching, I discovered that Italy was a lot different compared to the suburbs where I reside. It takes about an hour to walk from one end to the other. This posed a problem for me while I was planning; I wasn’t really used to city life, so I didn’t have a good sense of how long it would take to walk certain distances. I also had no ideas as to how long we would spend at each site. Would we spined at the Spanish Steps? Five minutes? One hour? What about the Pantheon? Maybe we would have extra time. Maybe we would be rushing everywhere. We really just had to wait and see. Now I know you’re curious to see how the trip turned out.
Overall, Rome was a great experience for me. I got to see the historical sites outside of textbooks and class and I was taken back by how huge everything is. You really won’t be able to appreciate the genius of the ancient Romans and the Renaissance artists until you get to observe the great works with your own eyes. Since we visited in December, we got to enjoy the Christmas lights and trees set up all across the city. And of course, the pasta, pizza, and gelato were all very delicious. There was a lot of variety at restaurants and cafes so I got to try things that were very atypical of my American lifestyle (Nutella pizza or fried zucchini flowers).
Now onto the specifics (click here to see a shortened version):
Here’s what I would advise: pack layers. We didn’t realize that most of the time we would be out when it was cold, so we didn’t pack very well. Only my mom did, so I had to borrow some of her clothes. It is really cold in the morning up to about 10 am and after sunset around 6 pm. Here’s what kept me warm:
This guide should have covered extensively all the little things you know about visiting Rome. Should you have any more questions, do let me know. Otherwise, I do hope this helped and safe travels!

From Bari I headed across Italy to Pompeii and an overnight stop in the Bay of Naples.
There’s not much that can be said — at least, not much that’s profound — about Pompeii that hasn’t been said, better, a dozen times before.
It’s been a world-famous tourist destination for literally centuries — an unmissable stop on the original Grand Tours.
So my main observations are pretty unoriginal.
My first: it’s big — really big. I trudged around for five hours and didn’t see it all.
As is always the case in places like this, the choking crowds of tourists quickly thinned out, observing the inverse square law of laziness.
My other unoriginal observation is that it’s amazingly well preserved. It’s not in obviously worse nick than the 30-year-old ruins we had seen in Mostar a few weeks earlier.
In a neat parallel to the low-value service industry focus of today’s Pompeii — surrounded by snack bars, restaurants and hotels — the ancient ruins of Pompeii show that not that much was different two millennia ago.
The economy of Roman Pompeii revolved, clearly, around having a good time.
Leisure centres — sorry, Roman baths. Sports centres — sorry, amphitheatres. Takeaways — sorry, thermopolia. Really, the tourist industry of southern Italy hasn’t changed that much in two millennia. The ancient ruined versions don’t even look that different from their modern counterparts.
After an overnight stop in Torre del Greco — in a charming farm with half-arsed service and unannounced restaurant closure — the car, which had been complaining of some unspecified lurgy since Albania (through the medium of beeps and a flashing orange spanner icon), finally decided that it was oil that it wanted.
The car had been bonked pretty hard on the underside in the rock-strewn ploughed field that passed for a car park at Bogove waterfall near Berat a few days earlier. Had I punctured the oil pan?
To make matters worse, I’d told a local tweenager trying to shake me down for a couple of lek to ‘watch my car’ to get lost. Had he sabotaged the car in revenge?
Was the car slowly bleeding out? Was it leaving a puddle of motor oil at every stop?
Was the motor, pistons unlubricated, grinding itself down into iron filings with every mile driven?
Being prone to anxiety, this is not the sort of thing I am particularly good at remaining relaxed about.
The anxiety was not improved by noticing liquid dripping from the underside of the car while waiting outside the gates of the guest house (the manager taking his sweet time — more than half an hour — to actually come and let me in).
Leaving a tarpaulin under the car overnight calmed nerves somewhat when it emerged the next morning without any oil stains at all. The dripping was… water from having cleaned the windscreen.
And, using a dipstick for the first time since my driving test, I concluded the oil level in the engine was just about tolerable — admittedly when parked on a slope.
My mind put slightly, if not entirely, at ease, I powered north towards Rome, where, after some not-entirely-enjoyable traffic, and quite possibly some low traffic neighbourhood-related traffic infractions, I parked the car underground for a few days.
I’ve been asked a ton of times why I can speak Italian. The answer I usually give — my dad’s a retired Italian literature professor and I grew up hearing it — isn’t really true, or at least, it’s far from a full explanation.
It’s not like hearing grown men talking about Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio is a great draw for a kid.
And I hardly ever went to Italy in childhood either — aside from two trips to Veneto, summer holidays were always in France.
It’s when I was a student that I became obsessed with Italy.
Over a couple of summer trips, I came to love all the ways in which it’s the best country in the world by a country mile. Nowhere else packs in as much good food, history, architecture and culture.
I came to love, too, all the other ways in which Italy powers through its manifest dysfunctions, shaking off flaws that would condemn lesser countries to failure and obscurity. I even enjoy — no, enjoy isn’t quite the right word, am entertained by — Italian politics.
And so, at a loose end the summer after graduating, having failed to line up a job (worse was to come when I lined up one I hated), I signed up for introductory Italian classes.
My ear trained by hearing the tedious Dante talk, my interest piqued by summer trips, and with the headstart that comes from French grammar and vocabulary, I found Italian ridiculously easy to learn.
After a couple of terms and fairly minimal effort, I was speaking far better Italian than I ever did German, despite six years’ hard slog through school.
I’ve been to Italy most years ever since.
Which makes it all the more odd that this was actualy my first trip to Rome.
It didn’t disappoint.
Not just because St Peter’s is every bit as extraordinary as its reputation. It feels corny to say, but it’s a genuinely awe-inspiring and — whisper it — spiritual place.
Not just because the ancient sites — the Forum, the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo — are so impressive.
Not even because the Pantheon is even more astonishing than I expected, and the architectural highlight of the entire trip.
In addition to that, it’s also everything I usually like about Italy — from the great food, to the nice atmosphere, to the walkable cityscape.
It’s also got the distinctive typography on its shop signs that you see everywhere in Italy and nowhere outside it.
(It’s also while in Rome that I got the good news about a funding bid I’d written just before heading off. This prompted an ill-advised but enjoyable number of Campari spritzes on a very nice café terrace in Trastevere, and a well-earned headache the next morning.)
After resting the ailing car for a few days, I made a detour to a Peugeot garage in the suburbs for the oil it was demanding, then headed north.

New theories about a mystery hundreds of years old and a secret known to few Romans that was not meant to be revealed
It was 8 a.C. when the famous poet Ovid fell out of favor with the Emperor Augustus, who exiled him, without the confiscation of his goods, to Tomis (now Costance), a small port on the Black Sea.
But what was the cause of this great punishment for such a famous and important character for Rome?
Let’s try to give an answer to this question, taking into account the new theories.
Publio Ovidio Nasone was one of the most important Roman poets, one of the main exponents of Latin literature and, above all, of the elegiac poetry.
- Elegiac Poetry: lyrical composition united by specific metric form and by arguments that were opposed to the epic with a subjective and autobiographical setting, interpreted as a lament.
Ovid was the author of many works and his fame was as great during his lifetime as afterwards: his style and his themes were taken up by Dante, Petrarca, Shakespeare and many other.
His most famous work is “The Metamorphoses” whose the best known story is Apollo and Daphne’s myth.
So, what was the reason for his RELEGATIO (exile)? It still is a mystery today as the clues we have come almost exclusively from Ovid himself: what we know for sure is that the poet was exiled by the Emperor Augustus, but his successor, the Emperor Tiberius, maintained the punishment.
The fame of Ovid, as mentioned, during his life was very great and therefore the reason behind his exile must have been very serious.
Let’s see here what his “error” may have it been, according to the scholars, ‘till recent times.
- An illecit relationship with Giulia Maggiore, the daughter of the Emperor Augustus, of which he sang in the “Amores”, under the pseudonym of “Corinna”
- Perhaps he favored the relationship between Giulia Minore, granddaughter of Augustus and daughter of Giulia Maggiore, and Senator Decimo Giunio Silanus, causing them to commit the crime of adultery
- He discovered illecit dealings of Emperor Augustus at his court
- He snooped about the private conducts of Livia Drusilla, wife of Augustus
- He partecipated in a conspiracy against Tiberius
It was precisely in the year of the exile that Ovid had achieved his maximus success thanks to “The Metamorphoses”, his masterpiece, in which he recounts the transformation of the protagonists into plants, animals or objects.
Ovid was considered a libertine and wasn’t well seen by the Augustan political side, very traditionalist and conservative, because he used to criticized the two fundamental pillars of the Roman society: Religion and Family.
But it was not this that caused the exile, but something that as a punishment had the “capital punishment” which, however, Emperor Augustus commuted into exile (as Ovid himself tells us).
But it really was one of the aforementioned actions that condemned Ovid? What about the “carmina”?
As mentioned before, the reason we have listed ahve been proposed by scholars until recently, almost forgetting the “carmina” implied and the fact that this could be connected to the “error” and not be a separate thing.
At the time of his exile, Ovid was writing the “Fasti”, an epic poem aimed at revisiting Roman festivals and rites: there would have been 12 books, one for each month of the year.
Halfway through the work, the order for the RELEGATIO arrived and the work was interrupted, nver to be resumed again.
- A clue -
At the beginning of the fifth book, where the poet researches the etymological origins of the name of the month of May and at a certain point, Ovid has the Muse Calliope (the poetry’s muse) tell the backgrounds of Rome’s foundation and she speaks of the constellation of the Pleiades.
In Latin literature, the importance that Ovid gave to this constellation when speaking about Rome’s origin is unusual: no one before him had mentioned neither Maia nor teh Pleiades in this context.
Certainly Ovid would never have allowed himself to invent something extraneous to the tradition regarding the birth of Rome (neither did the non-romans writers or Rome’s enemies).
- Was, therefore, a forbidden subject that Ovid wrote about? -
We must now take a step back and tell talk about an event that took place about 100 years earlie: the story of Quinto Valerio Sorano who was senteced to death for revealing the secret name of Rome.
Servius and Plutarch too wrote of the sacrilege commited by Soranus, a tribune of the plebs, poet and grammarian of vast erudition, dear friend of Cicero, whose sentence was death by crucifixion.
A certain reason, that we know for sure, for which the Romans kept the real name of the Urbe (other latin name for Rome) hidden and secret is the EVOCATIO (evocation), a rite for which the patron god of a city was invoked, pronouncing its name, in front of its walls during a siege: knowing the name of the god was the equivalent to seizing the essence of the city and subduing it.
- The Pleiades -
The Pleiades are a cluster of stars located in the constellation of Taurus, 440 light years away from the Earth and includes about 3000 stars, but the eye can see only 6 to 12 of them.
These stars are mentioned by many ancient peoples and it is considered that they thought there were 7 of them. They are found depicted in the Nebra Disc, the oldest surviving depiction of the night sky, dating back to 1600 b.C. .
Also according to the Greeks, the Pleiades were 7: Daughters of Atlas and Pleirone (daughter of Tetis and Ocean) their names were “Alcione and Merope, Celeno and Taigete, Elettra and Sterope, together with the most holy Maia”. (Cicero, “Aratea”)
At this point a consideration needs to be made.
In the ancient world what was sacred on earth was often a reflection of what was in the sky: for example, Mount Taigete (Sparta) took its name from the Pleiade mother of Sparta’s “founder”, Lacedaemon.
Here, as the Roman encyclopedist Marcus Terentium Varro: “Where now stands Roma, there was once the Septimountius, so called for the number of mountains that the city later included within its walls.”
We know that the Septimountius does not correspond to the Seven Hills of Rome, but the concept of the Seven Hills could itself be the result of a schematization that reduced the number of the hills of the territory that extends on the left bank of the Tiber.
This semplification would seem pointless, but perhaps the aim was to make the hills correspond to the Seven Pleiades; in fact, even the arrangement of the hills seems to respect that of the “seven stars pleiades”.
The Palatine Mount, on which Romulus traced the furrow of the Urbe, corresponds to “the most holy Maia”.
In the story of the foundation, we find another probable allusion to the Pleiades: Remus on the Aventine Mount and Romulus on Palatine Mount saw, respectively, 6 and 12 bird flying (as mentioned 6 and 12 are the Pleiades visible from the Earth by eye).
We must remember that the Pleaides are part of the constellation of Taurus, whose zodiac sign begins on April 21st… The foundation of Rome has as date April 21st 753 b.C. .
It cannot be excluded that even the number of the Seven King of Rome originated, rather than from a historical foundation, from the need for sacred numerology in which the number “seven” holds a prominent place.
A small detail to keep in mind, is that Ovid was originally from Sulmona, a city at the feet of the Maiella Mountain Massif, consacrated preciselt to the Pleaide Maia.
It is therefore possible that an educated Roman, starting from the passage written by Ovid, was able to understand that the city born from Romulus’ furrow, was consecrated to the Pleiade Maia, considered by Ovid himself, the most beautiful one.
For the ancient Romans, the Lares were divinities who protected and safeguarded the individual, the family and the home. The divinity that is introduced in the verses is called “Bona Dea” (good goddess) and it too had a protective function.
Even the real name of the “Bona Dea” was never to be spoken; the first to reveal it, was Macrobius in the V century a.C. by whuch time the pagan world was almost at an end.
Macrobius confirms that behind the “Bona Dea” was hidden Maia.
It is therefore no coincidence that Ovid dedicates the opening line of the book of and about May to her.
The sentence in the graphic specifies a relationship between Vulcan and Maia, in which the god offered a pregnant sow as a sacrifice to Maia, every 1st of May, so that the earth would be pregnant with fruit.
Vulcan represented the protective fire; this places him at Maia’s service in the defense of the city.
The juxtaposition between Maia and the “Bona Dea” allows us to see from a new perspective an episode that took place decades earlier, which involved, among others, Cicero and Cesare.
P. Clodio. Pulcro, one of the most discussed characters in the entire Roman history, on the night of the 4th of December in 62 b.C., disguised himself as a woman to secretly participate in a very secret ritual of the cult of the “Bona Dea” to which the women of the aristocracy were responsible, which was carried out privately in the residence of a high magistrate’s wife and in the presence of the latter and the Vestals (thus indicates the importance of this rite): that night the rite took place in the home of Cesare, that at the time was Pontifex Maximus.
Pulcro was discovered and underwent a trial in which he risked the death penalty, whilst against him testified Cicero.
Cesare, who as Pontifex Maximus, was one of the few who knew the truth about Rome’s secret name, divorced his wife after that deplorable episode. This shows how important the rite was.
If naming the true patroness of Rome was such a serious crime, why didn’t Augustus kill Ovid?
Calliope’s speech seems to have been cut: in fact, she never mentions Romulus, while the other two muses whom Ovid makes speak before her, do it.
It is therefore possible that Emperor Augustus had the compromised verses eliminated. Those were the verses in which it was stated that Romulus gave the secret name to Rome (a fact present in many latin and non-latin sources), following the prophecy on the place where Rome would be born.
In conclusion, Emperor Augustus granted clemency because Ovid, it seems, never mentioned Maia’s name directly.
But there were, probably, also political reasons for this choice.

AOG, Sitges
Word of advice number one: when you next go on vacation, don’t wear new shoes on the flight.
Why? Well, it could be that the airline looses your luggage and you are doomed to wear the same pair of new shoes for days on end. And your feet will not forgive you.
Word of advice number two: Never, ever, go to Rome in August. Not if you value your life and well being in general. And especially not if you are adverse to high temperatures.
Our friends had warned us against this.
“Don’t go, it is too hot!”, they said.
“Never in August. You’ll die from the heat!”, they warned.
Did we listen? Well, of course not.
Our logic?
“Well, we always say we won’t go in August and that we’ll go some other time, but then we never go”, said my partner. I agreed. My partner was right. We always say we’ll go some other time, but then we never do.
So a couple of years ago we decided to go to Rome and check out the Eternal City.
E t e r n a l mistake on our part!
After paying Vueling Airlines (a low cost airline) for 2 pieces of luggage, we arrived at Rome’s Fiumicino Airport with a slight delay, but no suitcases.
We only discovered this after waiting for our bags for over an hour at belt #9.
I went to the baggage handling company in charge of our flight (turns out there’s more than one. Blessed capitalism!) and they told us they had no record of our bags on their system.
Yes, having been to the country in the past, in fact, as recently as last June, my first thought was “typical Italian efficiency”, but I was wrong to think that. The problem was not typical Italian efficiency, it was typical Spanish negligence.
As we would find out the next day, the bags had never left Barcelona.
The Italian handler made us fill a form; he put our details into the computer, and sent us off on our less than merry way with a reference number which, we would later discover, was incorrect.
Although no consolation at all, we were not the only people without luggage on our flight, there was, at least, one other.
So there we were at Rome’s airport with a driver waiting to take us into town for 50 Euros, something we thought would be a good idea since we didn’t know the city and we wanted not to worry about the bags.
He was very nice, and if he was upset at having waited for over an hour, he didn’t let on.
We got into his Ford Focus and made our way to the Città Eterna.
I have to say that the drive went pretty well, and that the country side was not exactly very pretty. It was, all in all, a bit odd.
First we were on a highway, then, after a while, we found ourselves in what can only be describe as ‘leafy suburbs’.
He didn’t take any major roads and, instead, chose one-way roads with large, tall, walls, behind which I can only imagine must hide beautiful private villas.
It was a long while before we approached something which resembled the outskirts of a large city.
Once there what we saw first was the usual dim urban landscape, typical of any major European city post 1950.
Large, ugly, square, brick and concrete buildings, with many stores along the way selling mostly urban goods: fast food joints, urban clothing stores, ugly furniture shops, and the odd newspaper stand.
Still, we were excited to be in Rome.
I mean, R O M E !!
Right?
Then, suddenly, something which would happen again and again -though we didn’t know it at the time- occurred: when we least expected it, and just before we entered a tunnel, out of the corner of our left eyes, we caught a glimpse of St. Peter’s, in The Vatican.
This was unexpected because we had thought that we would view that particular monument going up the Via Della Concilliazione and into St. Peter’s Square, like almost everyone else.
But it was not to be. We quickly crossed the Tiber and drove down the Corso Vittorio Emanuelle II and into our hotel near the Campo de Fiori.
We paid our driver, gave him a tip, then checked in.
The hotel was ok. The recepcionist was not really friendly and did that thing which so often happens in Europe, he spoke as if HE was doing you a favor.
As if HE was paying for you to stay at the hotel. Not rude, just a bit…what’s the word… condescending and aloof.
Regardless, we had gone to Rome to enjoy the place and that is what we wanted to do. So we quickly forgot about him.
We had asked for a room with a balcony, and they gave us that, which was nice. But we soon discovered that the a/c was, well, less than able. It made a lot of noise, but gave out little cold air. But I would only realize this later in the day. And especially so at night.
We were starving by now and wanted to a) see the city and b) get some clothes. We had nothing to wear. Only the clothes we had on and which, by now, were very sweaty. Did I mention Rome was hot?
We left the hotel, which was, it seemed, used to situations such as ours. “You’ll get your bags tomorrow”, said the receptionist/owner, and off we went to eat and do some shopping.
We found a small restaurant about 3 minutes away and sat down. We ordered one pizza for the both of us and something to drink. It was the best pizza we would have during the whole trip. It was that good.
The service, however, was pretty bad. I wouldn’t say it went downhill from there, but rather that the service in Rome was consistently bad day in, day out.
Our waiters over the next few days, it would seem, would find new and creative ways in which to outdo their colleague’s ‘performance’ throughout our stay. And no, we hardly spent a penny on tips while in Rome.
So, after having lunch and stopping off at the local grocery shop where we got basic eating and drinking supplies, as well as some toiletries, it was back to the hotel, quick shower, and out before the stores closed.
Rome was baking under the sun, and us with it.
Out we went into the Corso Vittorio Emanuele II and started walking East, with no particular place to go. Also, we didn’t really know which way to go. We were torn between wanting to see the sights, and our clothing needs, so we tried to concentrate very little on what we saw, hard to do since if you’ve never been to Rome, everything is new to you, even when nine or ten centuries old. Or more.
Eventually, we got to Via del Corso, but not before we stumbled on the Piazza Venezia and the enormous marble and stone behemoth to our right: the monument to King Vittorio Emanuele II, first King of Italy.
This is one of the monuments on my list which I would not really arrive at the way I had expected. When I say we stumbled, I mean it. It is gigantic, but it is not exactly by a major road, it is on a major square, but off to the right, so if you happen to be on the street and not turn right, you might not exactly see it. But then, once you do, you can’t see anything else.
I wanted to go to it (yes, its array of classical columns was calling me) and bask in its classical ‘interpretative’ colossal beauty, but it was not to be on that first day.
We had no time, it was hot, and we needed clothes.
We turned into the Via del Corso, and forgot about it.
Via del Corso is one of those major shopping streets in central Rome. Many of the major brands, and others not so major, are there. Although Rome’s high class shopping strip is the Via Condotti, which is further down the Via del Corso, to the right.
On the corner, just as you go into Corso, there is the Doria-Pamphilj Palace.
Serene and decorated in a wedding cake style, I was immediately drawn to it.
But didn’t go, and would, unfortunately, not get to go during the trip.
And that pretty much sums up the entire trip. I didn’t get to see, go or do many things.
So back to the Via del Corso, and our shopping. We had nothing to wear the next day, and clothes were urgently needed. So we spent the best part of the afternoon traipsing from store to store, looking for garments, and missing out on Rome altogether.
On a side note, I must point out that, by now, my partner and I were wondering how the people of Italy reproduced since, it was very obvious, all the men in that country were gay.
But I digress…Clothes-wise, our main hope turned out to be H&M, but, once we got there, almost at the end of the Corso, we discovered, much to our dismay, that there was no Men’s section there.
Can you believe it?
We had walked the entire length of the Corso in the hope of finding a place which might have something -overpriced- but my size. Fat chance.
Since at that point we were only about two blocks from the Piazza del Popolo, we decided to go there.
I have to say that by now, I was ready to be impressed, or something, and impressed I was.
I had long wanted to see the twin churches of Santa Maria in Montesanto (1662-75) and Santa Maria dei Miracoli (built 1675-79). And there they were, in all their Baroque beauty. I think this is the one time Rome got interesting that day. I would say it made the whole thing worthwhile, but it isn’t true.The day had sucked all along from the minute our luggage went missing. But that moment, when we walked into that space, covered in fatigue and sweat, the city seemed beautiful, the tourists a mere nuisance, the heat (and it was around 8:30 PM) almost tolerable.
It was magic. Rome was magic.
We stopped at the obelisk in the middle of the Piazza, an original comission of Sety I (later erected by Rameses II) from Heliopolis which stands in the centre of the Piazza, inside a fountain, and is the second oldest and one of the tallest obelisks in Rome (some 24 m high, or 36 m including its plinth).
It was brought to Rome in 10 BC by order of Augustus and originally set up in the Circus Maximus.
Once there, a tourist girl asked her friend if she could drink from the fountain. My partner overheard her and told her that he’d read that you could drink from any fountain in Rome, unless it specifically said not to.
She was happy about this, and we spoke with her for a couple more minutes. Turns out she was from Spain, and was there on holiday with a couple more friends from school. She must have been in her very early 20s. And she was lovely.
It was starting to get dark, and we decided to get back to the hotel. We couldn’t decide between catching a bus, taking the subway, or walking. So we walked back along the dark and not too busy streets of, as it turns out, downtown Rome. Soon we were back at the hotel, where there were no news about our luggage.
The hotel’s concierge really couldn’t care less, so we went to our room, had a shower and went out to have dinner, not too sure about where to do this.
We decided to follow the incoming crowd down one of the streets, and ended up at the Campo dei Fiori. It was teeming with life: children playing, musicians, flower vendors, Indian or Pakistani salesmen of trinkets.
In short, Touristland right there in front of us. The only Italians being the waiters at the Campo’s many restaurants. So in we walked, and decided that the one on the right, on the other side of La Carbonara Restaurant, where we should have dined, just as you walked in, would do. Mistake. The food, although ok once we got it, did not surpass the bad service of a place which doubled as a drinks bar and dance club after 11PM.
We kept getting food meant for other tables, everything arrived at odd intervals, drinks had to be ordered more than twice. In short, a mess.
But given the day’s big story, it really paled in comparison. We didn’t mind much that the service was so bad. I think we were relieved it was over more than anything else!
Afterwards, we went for a walk on the Tiber, and saw that, at night, it really came alive. What a beautiful city this is.
It seems like the good citizens of Rome have allowed for bars and stands to be set up alongside the banks of the river. We were immediately drawn by the music and the bright, intermitent, lights of the marquees.
We crossed the bridge, and went down to the riverbank. We saw a couple of small stands which were a sort of Godsend since they had one of the items we needed most: a phone charger!
Yes, ours were safely (we hoped) stored inside our suitcases, and these, somewhere in Europe. We then decided to go to one of the “bars”. A rugby-themed bar by the side of the Tiber showing New Zealand’s Rugby matches.
Yes, slightly surreal, but then Rome is slightly surreal.
We would have stayed longer, but we were beat. We had had a long day and were yearning for sleep.
So after a couple of drinks, we headed back to the hotel. The room was not exactly cold, although the imitation a/c had been on all afternoon, so we agreed to sleep with the balcony window open. And the air con on. So our first day in Rome ended.

An Italian Summer — Part I
This is Part I of my travelogue An Italian Summer — starting with the eternal city of Rome.
Rome was not built in a day. No surprises — it took us four days to visit it and we were left wanting for more.
Rome is a veritable explosion of ancient history, art and culture. That also means it is thronged by enthusiastic tourists throughout the summer, and it is wise to plan in advance in order to avoid long queues and inconvenience.
The central location of our hotel — the Westin Excelsior — ensured we could reach most places of interest on foot, and get public transport for the others with ease. You will spend a lot of time outdoors in Rome, so choose location over amenities while picking a place of stay.
Let me walk you through our itinerary, answering some of the why’s and what’s alongwith.
We landed in Rome past noon-time on 3rd September and got ourselves a local SIM card and picked up our Roma Pass at the Airport.
There are a lot of posts on the internet debating whether the Roma pass is a good investment. Unless you are planning to vegetate at the Hotel, it is a no-brainer. It includes entry to the Colosseum & Forum, plus unlimited access to the public transport (Metro & Bus).
Get a cab from the Airport to the city centre, usually costs about €50–60. We freshened up at the Hotel, got ourselves a light lunch and started walking where our feet would take us.
The evening brought about an array of flavours. We ambled across the cobbled streets, got hold of every photo-op against pretty street cafes, saw miniature and life-size versions of wooden Pinocchios, and got our first lick of authentic Italian Gelato.
By the way, amidst all this, we also saw the Trevi fountain and climbed up the Spanish steps and saw a lovely sunset with a street musician singing Ed Sheeran in the background. The city of Rome is a gigantic museum — you just cannot stay away from history and architectural beauty.
We trooped back to the hotel early. Streets in Rome get rather desolate by about 9 pm, and roaming around on foot is not advisable.
The Roma pass includes priority access to the Colosseum (€18, otherwise). However, the authorities have placed a concurrent visitors restriction due to which one must also reserve a time slot at a cost of €2 per person here.
We had a slot for 12 noon so we had a relaxed start to the day. We had breakfast this day, and also the next 2 days, at this handy cafe called Xtra One Coffee at Via Lombardia. At our designated time, we entered the Colosseum through a priority channel, smirking at the long queues sweating it out for an entry. GET PRIORITY ENTRY EVERYWHERE YOU GO!
It is an awe-inspiring visual as one enters the colossal stadium. Though, thanks to repair work in arena area, there were steel scaffolds which ruined the authenticity of the surroundings. We plugged into Rick Steves’ audio tour as we entered and, while listening to its ‘bloody’ past, we roamed around its many tiers.
After a wholesome tour, we stepped out across the road to Ristoro Della Salute. And we were back in the queue for the Roman Forum by half past two. We spent a good half an hour waiting here (there’s no skipping this line). But it was well worth it.
Having read Julius Caesar as part of my ICSE syllabus, I was thrilled to be where it all transpired. The Via Sacra, Caesar’s grave, the Rostrum where Cicero and Antony spoke, the Vestal Virgins — it was like reading a book. and Rick Steves’ guide did complete justice to the experience, yet again.
Our next stop was the adjacent Palatine Hill (that’s where the word palace comes from) housing lush gardens and remnants of Rome’s glorious history. To be honest, if one intends to get into the details of the monuments scattered on this hill as well, it would be hard to do it the same day as the Colosseum and the Forum. The place shuts at 6pm, a fact that deprived us of a potentially lovely sunset from a vantage point situated inside.
After a long day, we headed to the nearby Gran Caffe Martini & Rossi to get an early dinner and some Sangria. What followed ranks among our top memories from the trip: a view of the Colosseum by night. That surreal picture summed up almost everything anyone asks for from Rome.
And that was Day 2.
This was our day of casual ‘walking around the city’ in between visits to the Colosseum and to the Vatican the day after. The idea was not to burn ourselves out in the first few days of the trip.
Rick Steves came to our rescue again. We picked up his walking guide “Heart of Rome” and headed out on the streets of Rome with our backpacks.
A bus ride from Bissolati to C.so Vittorio Emanuele, and we were at our first stop — Campo de’ Fiori, a lively market square with a dark history of public execution.
The colorful, busy market made for a great start. From here, we meandered through tourist laden streets, with historical nuggets strewn all around, to a centerpiece of Baroque art and architecture — Piazza Navona. The vast plaza is adorned with three majestic fountains including Bernini’s Fountain of Four Rivers, and Boromini’s imposing church facing them.
It was lunch time. While the piazza is lined with restaurants, we resisted the obvious options and walked into one of the adjacent lanes, and didn’t regret it one bit. As we walked the Via di Tor Milina, we bumped into merry accordion players, street bands playing with gusto and enthusiastic restaurant waiters offering us a ‘better’ deal. We chose a place closest to the music and downed some food with a serving of the much talked about Aperol Spritz.
With a fuller belly, we moved on to the iconic Pantheon, a monument preserved exceedingly well for its ~1900 year old history. Rick Steves has a dedicated audio tour of the Pantheon — you don’t need any guide thanks to that.
From here, Rick Steves was egging us to head to the familiar Trevi & Spanish steps area, so we looked beyond. Close to the Pantheon lies Largo di Torre Argentina, an important ruin and site of the murder of Julius Caesar — the senate was meeting across town on the day he was slain. Close to this was the Campidoglio — a hilltop square designed by Michelangelo with a statue of Marcus Aurelius on his horse marking the center and facades of conservatories marking its periphery. We spent some time visiting some of the relics housed in these buildings. These are covered under the Roma pass and could consume a good two hours if you are really into ancient relics.
Stepping out of the Campidoglio, we walked up the Altar of the Fatherland built in honor of Victor Emanuelle II in the early 20th century and boasting of an impressive facade. We could only spent about 20 minutes here since they evacuate tourists at 6pm.
Late evening took us back to the Spanish steps (a steep climb again!) and then to the Trevi fountain for a night time view which is highly recommended. We had an early start for the Vatican next day and we hadn’t really gotten rid of the jet lag, so this ended up to be another early night.
We had booked an escorted priority entrance to the Vatican on headout.com at 8am! While Vatican is accessible by train (Ottavio metro station), we took a cab and grabbed breakfast on the way. We made it in the nick of time only to be told that we were the only 2 people booked for the slot, and we could wait 30 minutes and join a full guided tour with 6–7 other folks, at no extra cost. w00t w00t!
Surely, the Gods had intervened. I have rarely ever gone for human guides, but the Vatican is a giant maze and it is highly recommended to book a full tour. It helped that our guide was knowledgeable and witty to match.
Keep a good 3–4 hours for a full tour of the Vatican, the Sistine Chapel and St. Peter’s Basilica (perhaps more if you want to climb up the Basilica’s steps to the dome). Even as you step out to the Vatican square, the plaza looks resplendent with fountains and an array of statues lining the surrounding buildings’ rooftops. Covering your knees and shoulders is advisable.
As we stepped out of the Vatican, we spotted a McDonald’s and that was lunch because, well, we needed a break from pizza & pasta. Already.
Before heading to Trastevere for our last evening in Rome, we did a detour to the Chiesa di Santa Maria della Vittoria which houses Bernini’s sculpture The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa — a statue you might remember from Dan Brown’s Angels & Demons. It is a church as grand as any other and an item checked off the bucket-list.
Trastevere is the trans-Tiber section of Rome. Due to its quaint and bohemian buildings and houses, Trastevere is pretty Instagram-friendly. There is an audio tour by Rick Steves on Trastevere as well, and we spent the first hour or so getting to know the history of the commune, walking the neighbourhood, and visiting the Church of Cecilia & that of Santa Maria.
It was Friday evening and weekend revelry was in the air. We passed a number of piazzas where locals had got together to enjoy some food, drinks and music. As the evening set in, we went back to Piazza Trilussa and saw an exhilarating band performance. Ponte Sisto — the bridge in front of the Piazza was also abuzz with street artists and beat boxers. It was a far cry from the vibe of central Rome, and it won’t be far-fetched to say that this was indeed the Heart of Rome.
We found a quieter alley for dinner at a fine restaurant called Latteria Trastevere. And with a long-ish goodbye walk, we boarded the tram from Trastevere to Venezia, where, to our surprise, there was a traffic stop due to a night marathon. So, we had to wait for half an hour under the Roman night-sky before taking a cab back to the hotel.
It was our last night there. We weren’t complaining.
Rome is a city that keeps giving. Every day spent, even visits to the same sites, at times, offered us a fresh perspective or a yet-unseen relic.
It is a modern capital city with its roots firmly planted in its past — be it the well-maintained ancient monuments, the social piazzas or the water pumps providing water to passersby — each one of them telling tales from a history as old as time itself.

January 4, 2022|Italy
As expected, very late last night, Boo and I got our test results back for the PCR tests we took late yesterday afternoon. Negative for COVID. So yay!
Except . . . when I went to wake up Boo this morning, she told me that during the night, she had a headache and sore throat. She had taken ibuprofen and the symptoms went away And she felt fine this morning.
So we went about our day as planned. We took a walking tour through Ancient Rome. We met the group near Trajan’s column then walked past ”the wedding cake,” the monument to the king who united Italy.
Our guide was OK. Informative but not that entertaining. On the upside, he didn’t sing, so that was a blessing.
The guide took us up the hill behind the wedding cake where we had a glorious view over the rooftops of Rome. We were there at the stroke of noon, so we could hear bells peal across the city.

I first visited Rome back in 2015, and it remains my favourite European city to this day.
Mainstream, I know. “What’s your favourite song, Wonderwall?”, I hear you ask.
Well, no (although I do love Oasis). Just hear me out.
I’m a firm believer that Rome’s reputation has suffered because it’s so popular. It’s as though people refuse to judge the city on its merit, so widespread is the knowledge of its undeniable appeal. Sometimes it’s important to take a step back, and to try and refresh one’s perspective.
I often struggle with cities. I don’t understand the appeal of London, living some 90 minutes away from it myself, and I’ve found the energy of big cities a little oppressive at various times in my life.
That wasn’t the case in Rome, though.
Down every street, and round every corner, there’s something to marvel at — some unwavering reminder of what our species has achieved, and how it has evolved.

The day out of Levanto was an early morning because of the train tickets we’d booked in Venice. We took a regional train to La Spieza, south of Cinque Terre and then a direct train to Rome. This train was different in that it had booths of 6 seats each. I asked Yuki if she felt like she was going to Hogwarts.
We arrived in Rome and had to walk 2km to the Airbnb apartment. We were surprised that a city steeped in such history would be covered in so much graffiti. It covers a lot of buildings, most train cars, all municipal work vehicles, and any spot like tunnels or under bridges that are easily accessible and discrete. At the same time, the cobblestone streets made it difficult to drag our suitcases and the narrow sidewalks littered with garbage were a constant obstacle course. For all the problems, it is perhaps surprising that the drivers almost always stop for you to cross the road if you step out in front of them. They don’t try to ignore you or speed behind you like in Canada. So at first we were hesitant to cross the road but soon became accustomed to finding a break in traffic and forcing the next car to slow down and stop for us.
We were pleasantly surprised that the Airbnb apartment was actually a one bedroom place and that we got our own room again.
Probably my favourite part of Rome is that there are ruins everywhere. We went out to see one attraction and on our way to finding a subway line we stumbled upon the Piazza di Porta Maggorie. There is a tram station beside the ruins of what use to be Rome’s old city wall where an aqueduct cuts through at 30m high and one of the gates to the city was a tomb to a slave that was freed and became wealthy as a baker.
Further on we walked beside the remains of an aqueduct, one of 11 that use to feed the 1 million inhabitants of ancient Rome. The aqueduct and city walls have openings which have roads going through them. Some of them are the original gates repurposed for roads but others are just large demolitions cut out of the wall.
Our attraction of the day was the Spanish Steps, located in the North East of the city. Photos made it look appealing but when we arrived around dinner time the square was packed with tourists and the stairs had become a de facto public bench. We walked up and read that the stairs were significant for connecting two parts of town at different elevations. Otherwise, there isn’t much to them and we were less impressed.
Surprisingly, we found a family run restaurant with an enthusiastic and very happy greeter and waiter. This fun meal would be an abnormally of our time in Rome where the restaurant was happy, joked around, and cared about the service and food that they served. For the remainder of our time in Rome, we would have difficulty finding good food and service.
Our day of sight seeing in Rome began later than expected but we took a tram and one of two subway lines to the Colosseum. There are hawkers everywhere trying to get you to join a tour group. They offered entrance in the next few minutes for 30 euros and said that the line was 2hr. In reality, the line was about half an hour and admission without any guide costs 11 Euro. It would seem, however, that tour groups would be the normal for all of Italy. Everywhere we went, we were mobbed by tourist groups, whether formed by a company or a sole person at the entrance. Some of the larger attractions also have self-guided audio tours and many people can be found standing awkwardly around the attraction holding half of a phone up to their ear.
Needless to say, Yuki and I didn’t use any guides. This meant that we didn’t actually learn anything while visiting the historic sites as there aren’t really any display boards. The only learning we did was by reading up on wikipedia after the fact.The tour groups looked slow and the tour guides seemed to drone on and on so it was nice to be able to go at our own pace and wander around instead of being stuck to a set path.
I wasn’t all that impressed by the Eiffel tower in Paris but the Colosseum was massively impressive. Stepping out of the metro station, the scale and size of the Colosseum is enormous. Even in ruin, it is wonderful in shape and form. From the outside, the form of the Colosseum is beautiful, with each successive arch and while deteriorated and broken, it is easy to image how much grandeur there would have been back in ancient Rome.
Entering the Colosseum was also spectacular. It is interesting to note that tickets to events at the Colosseum were free but seating was arranged by social standing with the wealthiest at the lower bowl and the poor, furthest at the top. Each of the arches at the base of the Coliseum was an entrance that lead directly to the intended seats. This eliminated cross contamination between social classes but also was incredibly efficient in moving people in and out of the stadium.
We walked around the lower bowl for photos and peered down into the galleries below the originally wood arena. The signboards said how there use to be mock naval battles but stopped after a renovation. it wasn’t clear if that renovation had to do with adding the basement or a perimeter wall. I cannot imagine how they would be able to flood the arena with a wood floor and not only support the weight of the water but also be waterproof at the same time.
After the Colosseum we had to wander around for a bit to find a place to eat, which was the normal Italian food, and then we sat outside the Basilica di San Pietro for a while because they close for lunch. Of note, there are some religious artifacts, including chains that held Saint Peter and a statue of Moses by Michelangelo. There were also some other tombs adored with skeletons which we found odd and the roof had a nice painting on it.
Then we walked back to the Coliseum to visit the adjacent Roman Forums. The ticket to the Colosseum includes the Roman Forums and Palatine Hill across the street. This is where the Roman government buildings were located and is nearby to a wealthy neighbourhood. What is most impressive about the forums is the height of some of the ruins, indicating that some buildings were huge.
The Forums are mostly ruins now but I was struct by how a much of it is brick. It seems that the romans built predominantly in brick and covered the structures in a concrete paste or marble. I’d known about the romans and concrete before but I didn’t realize that it was used as mortar between bricks and not contemporary concrete with aggregates and moulds. Only certain buildings, or parts of buildings, are constructed from stone.
By the end of the forums we were too tired to walk up Palatine Hill so we planned on coming back the next day because the tickets are valid for two consecutive days.
The next item on our list of places to visit was Trevi Fountain. We found a shop before the fountain where we bought postcards for 0.4 euro each. We thought this was pretty good because they can be as high as 1 and are usually 0.5 or above but we found another store later that had them for 0.3 euro. Oh well.
The fountain is probably the most photographed in Rome. It was also crowded and so it felt like a lot of the other attractions where we only had enough time to get in, take our photos, and get out. There didn’t seem to be any time to appreciate or enjoy each place, especially with the crowds.
From Trevi fountain we walked to the Pantheon, passing the Piazza Colonna, which is significant because the tall round marble Column of Marcus Aurelius recounts the conquest of the Emperor in relief carvings that spiral up to a statue at the top.
The Pantheon was as large as I’d expected it to be and enormously voluminous inside. Looking at the roof, we knew that the square recesses were to reduce the weight of the roof but we wondered instead why the roof couldn’t be thinner. Like the Colosseum and the Roman Forums, the exterior was all brick. Apparently it used to be faced in marble but over the centuries that was scavenged away.
After the Pantheon we walked to the Piazza Navonna which has another impressive, but smaller fountain. We took a peak inside the Saint Agnese but there was a Sunday service in progress and the space was surprisingly small, although ordinate.
We had our worst lunch lunch afterwards at a restaurant just outside the square. The service was terrible and the food wasn’t that great either. The worst part was that the waiter tried to take 5 euros tip from us and I had to yell at him to get all our money back. For hearing that Paris waiters were snobs, we didn’t have a problem there and found that Italy was generally much worse in the tourist areas but very good in the local parts.
We were going to take the bus back to Palatine Hill but we couldn’t find a place to buy tickets so we decided to cheap out and just walk back. Along the way we stopped at the Piazza Venezia and took photos of the Altare della Patria. This monument is a modern symbol to the city of Rome and has some newer statues.
There are a lot of steps to climb on the way up and the view from the top is okay, but not great. It’s possible to go to the top by elevator but it cost 7 euro and we didn’t think it was worthwhile. In some ways, this building gives an idea to the grandeur of ancient Rome and what it must have been like in the past.
At the edge of the Roman Forums we realized that we’d forgotten yesterday’s tickets so we weren’t able to get back in. Instead we walked around to the Circuit Maximus but I was disappointed to find a sloping field with barely any trace of a race course. The Circuit Maximus use to be the largest chariot race track in the Roman Empire and was also used for many ceremonies and parades. Today, it could be mistaken for an undeveloped site as there’s nothing but a walking path.
For dinner we tried to go to Sushi but it was a high class place with a long line up. Instead we went to a take-away shop but it took an hour for them to prepare it. Still, Yuki got her much desired sushi and we have a good dinner at home of the type of food we wanted to eat.
Yuki’s Dad wanted to visit the Vatican so we went there. It took us a long time to get through security because I picked the wrong line. There was a mass of people that split into four lines. The first two lines had a security checkpoint each but the second two lines funneled into a single checkpoint. We were in the second line and the people around us were quite aggressive to get to the front of each other.
Saint Peter’s Basilica, had been described to us as a lot of dead saints. Like all the other religious sites, it was highly decorated in gold paintings and large but wasn’t that interesting to us. Turns out, there are a lot of dead saints. We considered visiting the Sistine Chapel but it seemed far and likely to have a long line so we walked through the Basilica’s grotto and then went for lunch.
Everyone looked forward to lunch at McDonalds because it is a dependable staple to be the same everywhere in the world. At least, almost the same. The taste was slightly different but it was a welcome relief to all the plain food we’ve been having lately. We never thought that we would be so eager to eat at McDonalds for lunch.
The last place to visit in Rome was the Baths of Caracalla which we discovered was very close to the Circuit Maximus we visited the day before. We had to transfer between the two subway lines at the Rome train station so we also used that opportunity to buy tickets for Yuki’s parents to get to the airport as they would be going alone the next day. As with all things family related, it took a lot of explaining in three different languages to get the message through to her Dad who speaks English and Japanese and her mom who speaks Japanese and Thai. Yuki’s patience seem almost angelic for all the explaining and translating she has to do.
Frustratingly, the Baths closed early on Monday so we walked to them for nothing. Frances, who had visited Rome in August, recommended going to the Pyramide metro station and Eatalia, a department store of restaurants. It turned out to be a station beyond Pyramide so we had a tiresome walk and the building was actually more of an expensive health food store. There were three levels with restaurants but the main business was selling healthy foods and the restaurants looked posh. Dejected, we backtracked to a Ramen restaurant we’d passed walking there and ate a small early dinner because we were all still full on McDonalds for lunch.

The OUP blog has an excerpt from Bryan Ward-Perkin’s The Fall of Rome.
It is currently deeply unfashionable to state that anything like a ‘crisis’ or a ‘decline’ occurred at the end of the Roman empire, let alone that a ‘civilization’ collapsed and a ‘dark age’ ensued. The new orthodoxy is that the Roman world, in both East and West, was slowly, and essentially painlessly, ‘transformed’ into a medieval form. However, there is an insuperable problem with this new view: it does not fit the mass of archaeological evidence now available…
The Fall of Rome is one of these things that varies from whatever perspective you take. I remember my Roman lecturer on my BA commenting that many historians felt Rome went into terminal decline during the third century. Over two hundred years, he dryly noted, must have been some decline. The British Empire has collapsed in the last century, are we walking in the ruins of a one mighty empire?
Yet Ward-Perkins is right. There is a change. Pottery becomes pretty cruddy stuff. Writing becomes much much rarer. Civic centres fall. If civilisation is living in cities, then there is definitely a collapse of civilisation. While it might not be visible over the course of a lifetime, it is there. It depends what questions you ask of the data. The grand durée of history doesn’t disappear simply because the individual becomes the fashionable thing to study in the Thatcherite era.
I remember being taught that Saxons didn’t really invade, they came over as farmers. The Vikings didn’t invade either, they were peaceful farmers with a bad press. It makes you wonder how and why a lot of weapons came to be invented with all these peaceful farmers going everywhere. Perhaps an understanding of barbarians might remind us why civilisation might be a good idea.

To celebrate my 50th birthday, my best friend and I embarked on our first European adventure, with Rome as our initial destination. Upon our arrival, we were immediately struck by the city’s incredible scale and beauty. “Everything is so grand!” became our catchphrase — and it truly was. Down every street and around every corner, something extraordinary awaited. In the open-air museum that is Rome, forget the car, put on your walking shoes, and get ready to log 15,000 steps/day discovering the city’s landmarks and hidden treasures.
Before experiencing Rome in person, we’d spent months laying out our itinerary, starting with a Google map where we pinpointed the places we wanted to visit and marked the center with a figurative X. When we arrived in Italy, what had appeared on the map as a web of gray lines connecting landmarks was transformed into living, breathing Roman arteries bursting with vibrant culture and sensory delights. Serendipitously, the focal point marked by an X landed us in the heart of Rome at the Palazzo Navona Hotel, situated next to the Piazza Navona. It proved to be the perfect launching point for our three-day exploration of the Eternal City.

I took a three-day trip to Italy on New Years. It was always my dream to visit the great Ancient Rome, so you can imagine how excited I was for this trip. Throughout my visit, I experienced some wonderful places, great food, and met new people. I want to share with you the rookie mistakes that I made, the things I did right, and ultimately what I learned from this experience. Here are some tips for navigating your way through the beautiful city of Rome.
Pack well (and right!!): Extra clothes, check, portable charger, check, type C, F, and L power outlet plugs, not check. Seriously, I spent the first half of my day there looking for electronic stores with the correct power outlet adapters. I made a rookie mistake, and hopefully, you will not have to.
Don’t pay extra. If anyone tries to convince you that you have to pay to get into the Vatican, I will assure you that you don’t. As soon as I arrived at the Vatican, I was unpleasantly approached by a man who apparently had only two tickets left to sell for the Vatican. Most might think that they “got lucky” and that they had just made it there in time before tickets were sold out, but that isn’t the case at all. Just keep your head up and walk right into the Vatican. It’s free. Thankfully, binge-watching travel videos on youtube helped me with that one.
Take lots of pictures. If you are traveling along, you can even ask tourists to take photos of you! As a solo traveler, I had plenty of time to soak in all the views and take my time appreciating all the sights and wonders. It is nice to take some pictures so you can reminisce later (who knows when you’ll be back). If you want to take some pictures of yourself, ask tourists if they’d be willing to take it for you, you’d be surprised how much photography talent there is in the crowd. If you see someone who could use a hand, offer to help them take their picture, they might offer to take yours back. Well, hey, it worked for me.
Plan well! I packed my day with wonderful sightseeing adventures and activities. It is crucial to check openings of the different places, especially on holidays. Unfortunately, I missed out on the great opportunity of seeing the Sistine Chapel because it was closed on the new year.
Throw a coin (or two) into the Trevi Garden. Legend has it that if you throw a coin over your head into the Trevi Fountain, chances are, you will return to Rome. If you throw two, you will return to Rome and fall in love, and three, you will return to Rome, fall in love, and get married there. I don’t know if this has been proven correct, but it can’t hurt to take your chances either way. Unluckily, I didn’t get to throw coins into the fountain, but have no doubt; I shall return.
Check out what Italy is known for, then make sure not to miss out. I enjoyed some delicious Italian Ice Cream, Pizza, and House Wine. The wine is incredibly affordable in Italy. While in the restaurant, don’t rush to receive the bill. It is customary in Italy to stick around and have a conversation after a nice meal.
Fly Ryanair! This one is a little bit controversial. If you asked me then if I would fly Ryanair again, I would have said that I would absolutely not. Looking back though, I realize how convenient it was to have a cheap flight from London to Rome. Just make sure you read exactly what you need to do when buying the ticket so they won’t charge you extra for late check-in or carry-on bags. If you don’t want to experience flight delays though, don’t fly with Ryanair. They might have cheaper flights, but that doesn’t mean they come without a cost.
I hope asome of these travelling tips helped you out! I know that I need to take some of my own advice on my next trip to Rome.
Edit: This blog is a repost from 3 years ago when I first visited Rome. Hope you enjoy!

For those unfamiliar with the Total war franchise it is essentially the dream game for military-history nerds like myself. It allows you to play as various different factions during a set time period- whatever era that game has chosen to focus on. Your aim as that faction is to conquer the map and build your empire. Unlike other history strategy games like EU4 or the Civ games, you can fight battles in real time on campaign maps. This is really what set total war apart and is why I fell in love with the games at a young age.
Of the various different time-periods Creative Assembly (the UK-based game developer) has done over the years the Ancient-Roman/Greek games have always been of particular interest to me. The idea of testudos, phalanxes and war elephants appealed to me in a way that things that came before such as Stone/Bronze Age warfare and periods that came after like the Medieval era could never fully equate to.
Needing to relax in my free time, as I am currently preparing for my COMPTIA Security + exam, I decided to play Rome Total War 2. However, the vanilla version of the game is a bit too normal and to spice things up you really have to be playing the DEI mod. If you were to sum up the DEI mod in one word it would be immersion. Multitudes of carefully researched new units, game mechanics and options have been added to the game.
All I needed to do now was pick a faction. Having recently done a Roman run and given that I’ve been reading and watching videos on the Punic war I wanted to give the Carthaginian Empire a good go. My aim would be to do what Hanno, Hannibal and Hasdrubal couldn’t. Conquer Italy.
Like in real life, in 272 BC Carthage has a tricky start. As a maritime focused, trading empire, stretched across the western Mediterranean, you find yourself facing threats from multiple directions. Your Spanish holdings are open to attack from savage tribes across the Iberian Peninsula, desert tribes to your south are ready to strike when they sense you are at your weakest and your holdings on the Island of Sicily are also under threat from the Greek city-state of Syracuse. And this is of course all before you come to the main emerging threat to your empire…the Romans!!!
No mean feat to be able to deal with such an array of threats. But wait there’s more. To make matters worse and in-accordance with historical accuracy, your land forces leave a lot to be desired. Carthage, as is the way with many trading empires, relied heavily upon their wealth to get mercenaries to fight their battles for them and only had a small core of their citizens as soldiers. The mercenary-centric nature of your armies could not be more strongly contrasted with the state-funded and citizen-staffed legions of Rome. Yet, there are some slightly redeeming features such as having superb cavalry, like Numidian and Iberian horsemen, and an array of aggressive light infantry mercenaries, which you can get from Gaul and Iberia. Whereas Rome goes for standardisation, to play to your strengths you should rely on the variety of mercenaries you can choose from.
With this all in mind, I devised a clear strategy. I would focus, as Carthage did in real life following their defeats in the 1st Punic War, on expanding my already existing Spanish holdings. I wanted to be able farm their resources and set up mines in order to fill my coffers for my future war against Rome. In essence it was a race against time- could I add Spain to my Empire before Rome came south and attacked me? In order to fulfil this strategy, I would have to leave other fronts less defended and accepted that some territorial losses like in Sicily or Africa would occur as a consequence of focusing on Spain.
Things kicked off to a terrible start. Whilst recruiting armies in Nova Carthago (SE Spain) to begin my bloody conquest of the Iberian Peninusla, Syrcause decided to launch a surpise attack on my Sicilian cities. They swiftly took my cities and liberated them to a Greek vassal of theirs. This was all part of the plan… I expected this to happen I reassured myself.
All was not lost, however, for two reasons. Firstly, through the use of trade and diplomacy I was able to prevent the desert tribes from attacking me to the south and I had secured my eastern border by establishing friendly relations with the Ptolemies in Egypt. Also by implementing a policy of Divide et Impera (see what I did there) I was now picking off one Spanish tribe at a time. Even better Rome had become mired in an attritional war against Epirus and then subsequently wars against raiding Thracian and Illyrian tribes. Again all I needed was time, even if they won those wars I would be strong enough to handle Rome on my own…if I conquered Iberia.
However, whilst I was getting closer to completing this goal, with my various armies subduing and annexing one tribe after another- disaster struck again. One of the Carthaginian noble houses revolted against my rule (the Barcid Family) and launched a revolt in my western African possessions . This threatened to stall my Spanish foray grievously. Luckily through the extra funds I was now receiving, I raised extra armies to speed up my conquest of Spain and through the use of my Numidian vassals I was able to simultaneously conquer Iberia and stave off the threat from the fifth column.
I was therefore ready to invade Sicily and take back what had once been Carthaginian. The invasion was swift and decisive. The Greek field armies, weakened by their own failed invasions, were swept aside by my invasion force. The siege of Syracuse was tough and bloody and after a desperate sally attempt by the defending forces; the city eventually fell.
Rome, seeing that I had taken all of Sicily for myself, declared open war against me. I knew I had to act fast, raising another army in Carthage and bringing my last army in Spain over to Sicily I was ready to invade Italy proper itself. My forces were able to overcome the two Roman legions defending their southern most province, Consentia.
Following this, Rome attempted to field 3 legions against my main force, however with fresh reinforcements coming in from Carthage and Iberia, I was now able to threaten multiple cities on the Italian mainland. After a great battle near Beneventum, I had crushed the last significant Roman force on the Italian Peninsula. It was a brutal engagement, which was won by my Iberian cavalry delivering a rear charge to their infantry and shattering their centre. After I secured my foothold in Magna Graecia, I finally marched on Rome. Following a direct assault on their city walls, the garrison of Rome was overcome and the city fell into Carthaginian hands. Rome was a broken power all that was left was to mop up the remaining strongholds it held on Italy.
So what are my reflections on playing as Carthage? Tough to be sure, particularly with the mod I was using. Fun?- Definitely, the initial position Carthage finds itself in requires planning and strategic foresight from the player. Although there were certain things the game cannot accurately represent and a couple of things which were a bit unrealistic, playing as Carthage is certainly something I would recommend to any person considering checking out the DEI mod. It is probably not as fun as Rome, the mod is built around playing as Rome, but as my Carthaginian campaign shows, you can still have a whole lot of fun roleplaying an alt-historical scenario such as winning as Carthage during the Punic Wars. These what-if scenarios have always fascinated us amateur military historians because we get to relive the strategic decisions that generals went through and it is exciting in itself to see how a different military strategy could have enabled a losing side to win and changed the course of history.

The professor showed us a photo of an insect.
“What is that?” he asked us.
A cricket.
“What would you think if you saw it on your bed?”
Get it off my bed.
But would I think the same way if I grew up in another part of the world?
Crickets.
Stepping on a plane to Rome, I did not expect that a metaphorical cricket would be one of the most important things I took with me on the plane back. But, here we are.
I recently spent two weeks in Rome, Italy, taking an international business class through Marquette University’s summer study abroad program.
We spent much of our time learning about how to do business in a global market and how to understand cultural differences. We also toured businesses in Rome and saw how global companies operate. We spent time exploring Rome and of course, eating a lot of gelato.
I had never been abroad. I had never even taken a business class. But this program expanded my view of both in new ways.
They say when in Rome, do as the Romans do. When I was in Rome, I saw firsthand how we all do as our culture tells us to do. But I also learned how to bridge those divides.
I have taken international advertising and public relations classes so I had some knowledge about global business before I went. I knew about high context and low context cultures. I knew about the importance of a power index to some cultures. I thought I understood it — but being abroad changed my perception on culture.
We are all told to live by the golden rule: treat others as you want to be treated. This doesn’t apply in other cultures. Here’s why.
Professor Kevin MacGabhann from the Strasbourg Business School in France was the professor who pulled up a photo of a cricket. He eventually explained.
In America, we see crickets as pests.
In Thailand, crickets are a popular snack.
In China, crickets are pets.
We might find customs strange if we’re not used to them. But once we learn more, we can understand it.
Most people understand that cultures build bonds and also create differences among groups of people. We can then begin to understand those differences as we learn more.
Professor MacGabhann showed us that understanding is only the first step. We need to recognize these differences in ourselves. We might find it abnormal that people eat crickets, but they might find it abnormal that we kill them.
Cultural differences are two-sided; we need to recognize the differences in both directions.
After we recognize our own cultural differences, we can begin to adapt. This is the most crucial step. Treat others as they want to be treated.
Treat others as THEY want to be treated.
When we are among different cultures, we need to adapt to their culture. Without doing that, we will run into tension and problems. That does not mean we need to go out and buy a cricket to keep in our room or eat one with dinner. It means if we are in Thailand, China, or somewhere else, we shouldn’t step on a cricket.
And maybe you are already adapting — you can get a cricket lollipop in Waukesha or a grasshopper taco at Belair Cantina not too far from campus.
In the context I learned them, these points were geared toward international business relations. However, they do not stop there.
I think that this point is so important no matter where we are. There are different cultures within schools, neighborhoods, work environments. We need to understand, recognize, and adapt whether we are in the Marquette bubble or across the world in Rome.
We need to understand, recognize, and adapt whether we are in the Marquette bubble or across the world in Rome.
I know that now I am going to look at my everyday life differently. I will pay more attention to the cultures surrounding me and do my best to learn and adapt.
I want to travel abroad again. I want to find new cultures and learn about them and try to adapt to them. But I do not have to go far to do that. I will start where I am and hopefully that will lead me across borders again.
Because abroad or not, I want to remember to do as the Romans do. Treat them how they want to be treated.

The Vestal Virgins inhabited a unique space in Roman society. They were the most prominent women in Rome, heavily revered and with privileges no other woman was given. But they also lived with extreme duties and restrictions. Their most famous restriction is obvious from their title: every Vestal was unmarried and pledged to remain a virgin through her thirty-year term of service. And a Vestal who broke her oath of chastity was buried alive.
But how often was this extreme measure used? And when it was, what did it look like? I have been researching Vestals for a few years as I work on a historical fiction novel centered around one (coming soon, I hope), and I’ve had to get into the nitty gritty details. Here’s what we know about the ultimate punishment for Rome’s most sacred virgins.
Before we bury one alive, let’s make sure we know who the Vestals were.
People ignore Vesta, but she’s one of my favorite goddesses, and was one of the Romans’ favorites too. Her duty doesn’t sound like a big deal today — goddess of the hearth, the fireplace. Modern people tend to think, “why have a goddess for that?” But for the ancients, the fireplace wasn’t just something to get cozy by to drink hot chocolate. It was the source of fire for the house, meaning the light for their lamps and the heat that cooked their food. Without Vesta’s flame, a house was vulnerable and unlivable. Vesta made a house into a home.
Sure Vesta isn’t as splashy as some other deities — she’s a virgin goddess so she doesn’t have relationship drama, and she’s a guardian of the home so she doesn’t leave to have adventures. But to the ancients she was steadfast and ever-present, a goddess without whom life would have been impossible.
Vesta’s private role as protector and life giver to the household was reflected in her public worship. There was a shrine to Vesta in the Forum Romanum¹ tended by the Vestal Virgins, who kept her sacred flame burning. Just as a house must have a hearth to make it a home, Rome was not Rome if the eternal flame was not burning — the flame represented the safety of Rome, and the favor of the gods that allowed Rome to hold its vast conquered empire. It took 24-hour maintenance to keep the sacred flame from going out. The Vestals also prepared the sacred grain/salt mixture that was sprinkled on the head of every sacrificial animal, so in a real way, Roman religion would have been nothing without them.
This legal status of the Vestals was unlike any other woman’s in Rome. For the ancient Romans, one of the essential characteristics of a woman was male control: she belonged to either her father or her husband. Widows with no living father had to pass into the legal control of a living male relative.² Unfortunately, the notion of women belonging to men is not strange to us. But male control of women was much more deeply entrenched in the Roman legal code than it ever has been in ours, and freeing the Vestals from that control put them into a shadow category, a zone that was neither masculine nor feminine. They could make wills and testify in court, which other women could not because they weren’t considered autonomous. They were also sacrosanct — it was illegal for men to touch them — and bizarrely sacred — if a Vestal accidentally met a man on his way to execution, his life would be spared.
After their thirty years were up, Vestals could do as they wished. Many chose to marry (and apparently men really loved marrying former Vestals, which seems like a lot we could unpack but I’m choosing not to). But many chose to continue their legal limbo — if she married, the former Vestal rejoined Roman society as a wife, reentered male control in the household of her new husband. An unmarried former Vestal was still a woman apart, the only truly autonomous woman in ancient Rome.
In short, Vestals were separate from Roman society, even as they lived in the middle of it. They were separated legally, and they were separated from close contact. They were not Romans really, but something else… they were representatives of all Romans, and of Rome itself.

But I promised I’d tell you what happened when a Vestal Virgin was convicted of violating her oath of chastity. For a Vestal, having sex was a betrayal of her promise to Vesta, an act which would put the safety of Rome in jeopardy. The virginity of average Roman girls and women was controlled in similar (though not identical) ways as in many societies today, but that’s not really what was going on with the Vestals. A Vestal’s purity was supposed to be a requirement for the proper public worship of Vesta, and Vesta’s worship guaranteed the safety of Rome. So an “improper” Vestal would lead to a loss of favor with Vesta for all of Rome — big trouble.
The accusation of inchastity could come in a few forms. It might come from a man — from someone who had heard of an affair, or maybe (though less likely for reasons that will soon be obvious) from the man who’d had sex with her himself, in a moment of repentance.
But, since a Vestal having sex was supposed to be an affront to the gods, the accusation might also come in the form of prodigies. Prodigies were messages from the gods in the form of unexplainable and supernatural events — calves born with two heads, lightning striking prominent monuments, etc. Two examples that stick in my mind are a soldier’s shield falling from the sky and a fully intact human head being found in the ground when digging a foundation. Prodigies sent the Romans to their priests, who would interpret the message and tell the citizens what action the gods required from them.
Some prodigies were good, but many (perhaps even most) threatened doom unless the gods were appeased. And sometimes the omens pointed a finger at the Vestal Virgins, and one or more of them would be accused of violating their oaths without any earthly evidence.
After the accusation, a trial. This was not the same as the trial of a citizen: it was a religious trial with the Pontifex Maximus as judge and the Pontifical College as jury.³ The priests would vote to convict or acquit. If they convicted her, the Vestal would be executed.
The doomed Vestal was carried, gagged, through the streets in a litter that had its coverings fastened down with cords; she could be neither seen nor heard. Crowds followed the litter, but it was apparently a solemn and silent occasion. She was brought to a tomb buried under a ridge of earth near the Colline Gate, on the north side of the city. Paradoxically, the tomb of disgraced Vestals was the only tomb allowed to be inside the city walls.
The tomb was stocked with provisions: bread, water, milk, oil, a lamp, and a bed, as if the Vestal was expected to go on living inside. Her litter was unbound and she was led, heavily veiled, to the steps to her tomb. Then the Pontifex Maximus said a prayer, and all the pontifices would avert their eyes as the Vestal went down, to avoid witnessing the moment of shame.
The tomb was buried, and the Vestal was left to die down there, no grave marker to commemorate her improper death.
The Vestal’s lover would then be subjected to a public flogging. Whipping was a common punishment — the pain was part of the point, but it was more about the public shaming. These floggings could leave the man alive, or they could be carried to the point of his death. Or, if her lover saw all this coming, he might just flee into self-imposed exile.
It was common for upper-class men in Rome to escape into exile if they knew they were about to receive a punishment that would either a) permanently mar their reputation or b) kill them. Rome tolerated this sort of thing and made no effort to hunt down the fugitives — a man who saw a trial turning against him would often leave town at night and face no consequence other than his loss of status. In the eyes of the ancient nobility, that loss of status was punishment enough… but when you put it on a scale next to “buried alive,” yeah, not so much. It was very possible for a man to escape with his life if he were accused of sleeping with a Vestal, and very difficult for the Vestal herself to do the same.
medium.com
The live burial of a Vestal was, importantly, bloodless. The Romans didn’t kill the Vestal — they put her in a room with the essentials of life to sustain her, and she died without their intervention. (Yes, I am aware they buried her in there; this is ritual, not logic.) It also offered the convenient out that the goddess could, if she so chose, save her priestess and prove her innocence. (I’m not sure if this was something the ancient Romans thought or just a modern supposition.)
The burial can also be meaningfully thought of as a human sacrifice. The gods were upset, and the Romans were offering up one of their holiest priestesses to soothe them. Human sacrifice was unthinkable to the Romans of classical times, but many of their religious rituals had much older roots in prehistory. Meanings got twisted and lost. The Vestal Virgin might originally have been a scapegoat, which would explain why she was kept so carefully between categories: she was no one’s wife and no one’s daughter, so she had no family to demand retribution for her death.
This quality of being outside categorization, and thus available as a sacrifice, might also explain why the Vestals had to be virgins in the first place. In a society in which a woman’s identity was totally dependent on her relationships with men, the sacred virgin stood apart. When they worshipped Vesta, the Vestals acted for the entire city: they could not represent the daughters, wives, or mothers of Rome (as other priestesses did); they had to be blank slates, to represent all Rome. Virginity meant lack of connections.
In short, a properly chaste Vestal was Rome itself. For the Romans, her purity was the safety of Rome, and when she lost it — when she slipped out of her symbolic role and back into worldly society by coming under the sexual “control” of a man — she had to forfeit her life as a sort of sacrifice to appease the gods. This she did in a method devoid of the kind of violence that would have sullied her further.
The immurement of a Vestal was a very rare occurrence. We only know of a few instances in all of Roman history.
Most of the Vestals who went on trial in the historical record were acquitted, not executed. In early history, we get the story of two Vestals who miraculously saved themselves from accusations of wrongdoing. When Vesta’s flame went out (usually interpreted as a sign of Vestal wrongdoing), the Vestal Aemilia threw her sash on it and it miraculously roared back to life, saving her. And a Vestal named Tuccia in the 3rd century BCE cleared her name by carrying water across the city in a sieve without spilling a drop. Vestals, as holy women, were supposed to be able to work miracles. Continuing to work miracles proved the continuing favor of Vesta, meaning they must still be virgins. (How or if these magic tricks fit into the formalized trial structure, I’ll never know.)
In 114 BCE came a bizarre prodigy: the young daughter of a prominent Equestrian was struck by lightning while riding her horse, and was found dead with her tongue sticking out and her dress hiked to her waist. Officials interpreted this as a sign of a scandal between an Equestrian and a Vestal Virgin. (Obvious, right?)
Three Vestals were accused: they said that Aemilia (not to be confused with the earlier miracle-worker) had become corrupt herself and then led the other two, Marcia and Licinia, into vice with her. Aemilia was convicted by the Pontifical College and executed, but the other two were acquitted.
What followed was outrage. The Roman people were convinced that there was a conspiracy of priests covering up the widespread corruption of the Vestal Virgins, and that the other two Vestals were also guilty. So in 113, a Tribune held another trial for the other two Vestals, moving it out of the Pontifical College and into the traditional court system. This trial resulted in a guilty verdict, and Marcia and Licinia were also executed.⁴
Emperor Domitian executed four Vestal Virgins starting in 87 CE. This was part of a push toward cracking down on public morality: like many reformers before and after, Domitian believed that people’s morals weren’t what they used to be, and that he could bring back the good old ways by punishing people for acting wrong. (Yeesh.) Domitian was also notoriously hostile toward the senate,⁵ and since the Vestals were the daughters of senatorial houses, killing them was a way to show the nobility who was boss. Since the emperor was always Pontifex Maximus, Domitian ran the trials and had no trouble securing convictions.
The first three convicted Vestals were actually not buried alive. Domitian allowed them to choose their method of execution. Only for the last, the Chief Vestal Cornelia in 91, did he insist on the ancient punishment. Which makes for an interesting point: we don’t know if the Vestal executions I described earlier were by burial. As far as I can tell, Cornelia is the only verifiable instance we have of a Vestal being buried alive. We know that the Romans considered this the ancient, traditional punishment, but we don’t know of anyone else it happened to.
Cornelia used the big public spectacle of her immurement as a platform. She announced to the crowd before the descended the steps: “Caesar thinks me unchaste, me who performed the sacraments under which he won, he triumphed?” Because, of course, a successful Domitian meant the favor of Vesta; if the empire was doing well, then surely that meant Cornelia was actually innocent.
On her way down, Cornelia stumbled, and the soldier accompanying her put out a hand automatically to help her. But Cornelia kept her balance without him and shied away from his touch — a sign to those watching (according to Pliny the Younger who recorded the incident) that this Vestal was so chaste she would not even accept the sacrilege of a man’s touch on the way to her execution.
And that’s about it for historical examples. There are vague insinuations of other Vestal executions, and concrete details of many other trials that resulted in acquittals, but we only have that handful of confirmed Vestal deaths, only one of them definitely by live burial. So though this sensational and very public punishment cast a long shadow over the lives of thousands upon thousands of Vestals who would never experience it, actual instances were vanishingly rare.
Which leaves us with two possibilities:
I’m inclined toward option 1 — probably there were instances of option 2, but the Rome I know was sincere enough in its religious beliefs that I have a hard time believing they were all openly flaunting tradition but not writing about it. I also think that the Roman men who wrote the histories had a hard time believing in a group of women who are uninterested in sex, and felt it necessary to imply that there had to be something going on there (when really, the something was worshipping Vesta). But historically, of course, it’s unknowable.
The Vestals were women who lived outside Roman society even in its very heart. From them we can learn much about Roman religion and Roman womanhood — and we can glimpse the sinister reasons for the policing of their virginities. The Romans held the Vestals up high when they were shining examples of Rome’s piety, and struck them down as low as they could when they became evidence of Rome’s corruption. The Vestal Virgins may have been the six most important women in all of Rome.
¹We usually call it the Temple of Vesta, but a Roman temple had to be planned out by augury (which Vesta’s wasn’t) and traditionally contained a statue of the deity (which Vesta’s didn’t). It was also rather small.
²In actual practice, such widows were usually fairly independent. But the fact remains that there was a legal requirement that they be in a man’s control.
³The Vestals were part of the Pontifical College, so the Vestals who had not been accused would have voted on the guilt or innocence of their colleague. Roman juries did not have the same ideas around impartiality as ours — in fact, it was considered an advantage if members of the jury to know the accused well, since their opinion of their character had weight in the case!
⁴This was a big move, the imposition of the civil government into what was supposed to be a religious matter. The boundaries between state and religion were a lot more porous than they (ideally) are today, but still — it was an insult to the priests, whom the politicians accused of not being able to handle their duties.
⁵There’s a probably-untrue anecdote in Cassius Dio in which Domitian invited senators to dinner and had gravestones for each of them made to put in their seats.

A Place to Be Funny Without Being a Jerk

January 2, 2022|Italy
Today was a quiet day. We said goodbye to granny’s apartment in Assisi and boarded the train to Rome, our final stop in Italy.
The train trip from Assisi to Rome is not nearly as picturesque as the trip from Florence to Assisi. Fewer vineyards, fewer olive groves, fewer castles, no snow-capped peaks in the distance. We did see a few notable sites, however. In particular, we passed by Trevi (the town, not the fountain) which is one of those classic medieval towns where the church is on the peak of a hill and the rest of the town seems to tumble down the hillside.
We also passed by some random towers and fortifications that don’t seem to be guarding anything more interesting than a parking lot and a smattering of houses these days.
As we approached Rome, the surroundings, unsurprisingly, got more industrial and grittier. We passed by nondescript apartment blocks and graffiti that could have been in almost any city in the world.
We arrived a Termini station and seemed to walk for a mile to get to the exit. Then we hopped into a cab which proceeded to gouge us unconscionably. I’m too irritated to go into detail but it…

TLDR; I describe only this first stop of a recent 2-week trip to Italy — partly because of the initial strong and quintessential impressions I formed in this my first-time trip to Italy, and partly because the other dozen or so cities I visited which the reader can probably guess mostly echoed and nuanced these impressions.
Disclaimer: this is not meant to be fully representative of what you should expect when travelling in Rome. In fact it is probably a quite biased series of observations privy to my own meanderings, but I must say these feel very genuine and idiosyncratic of the city. All photos are unedited originals, and no AI was employed in the writing of this article. So Italians, feel free to bawl me out in the comments!
I am not an untraveled citizen of the world — — I’ve lived and toured all over Russia and China for years, for example — yet there are hundreds of countries I’ve never been to. Italy, for example! I realize this may be the exception to the rule for most Americans who can afford to cross oceans for travel, as Europe is a ready destination, whether to enjoy a summer out of school or participate in an exchange program because the cultural and linguistic barriers are lower than for Asia or Africa, for example.
Yet, I did not take preparation for this trip lightly. As I had done in my previous travels, I prepared as much as I could for the language, as I feel it is best to try to speak the local tongue not only out of respect for the people but also to enrich your own experience. Before traveling to Russia and China, for example, I had become fluent in those languages by my tried and true method. But for those I had a few years to spend, whereas this time I had just a few weeks. After skimming a long treatise on Italian grammar, I decided it was hopeless to memorize all the rules. I figured I would be best served in this time frame getting the gist of pronunciation and some basic phrases: what seemed to work well was opening up Google Street View to random locations in Italy, trying to guess the meaning of any signs or writing (graffiti included!) and speaking into Google Translate to check my pronunciation. Sometimes I was way off, but this made it fun! I also got some ‘street smarts’ of what to expect in random city locations. (Later on I had fun actually doing this live when traveling through city streets:
)
More formally, I transcribed Youtube videos (with captions to check my work) to polish listening comprehension. This is so much better than the old days of transcribing radio, and there’s a semi-infinite supply of great captioned videos out there. It’s nice that the graph shows, umm, statistically detectable progress over time!
I was still, however, pathetically prepared for the language. Luckily it is a Romance Language and thus not too far from English and Spanish, of which I know a little, so I could in principle struggle by. BUT, most importantly, essentially everyone we met in Rome spoke English! And when English didn’t pass the bar, they spoke Chinese! No joke, there is a sizable Chinese population in Rome running hotels, restaurants, taxis, and small shops, and I could converse with them absolutely fine!
Now the reader can imagine the usual hassle of international travel culminating in a teleportation to another reality outside the Fiumicino Airport. It looked not too dissimilar from JFK, to be honest. A Chinese driver picked us up, and we grilled him on all the ins and outs of living in Italy what with driving, shopping, eating, avoiding pick-pockets, etc. (he in fact spoke absolutely no Italian despite living there 14 years … that just shows you how strong the Chinese community is there!).
And I now transition to a series of disconnected, but in my view very profound, observations during my travel in Rome. What you will not see is any canned, touristy photos of say, the Colosseum.
Ah well, you’ll forgive me that one.
Every city has history, but in Rome it stares you in the face at every street corner. I mean, you’re walking along the street minding your own business and then the Pantheon is just there in front of you!
And plenty of modern shops and restaurants surrounding it from which to enjoy the view! (NB: these are usually not the better, more authentic restaurants).
Now this one really gets me, I mean is it just improbable or does this kind of thing happen every day: I’m walking through the park next to the Roman Forum, in the baking sun with my sandals feeling very historic and all, on a wide, dusty dirt path that must be trodden daily by thousands of tourists, and look down to pick up a dirty penny. I’m joking to myself, naw, could it be? Rubbing off the dirt, it is indeed no ordinary penny: it looks ancient! Well after some Google Image search it looks quite possibly to be not thousands of years old, but at least 200–300 years (a Vatican copper Quattrino from 1745?). Could also be a forgery to dupe stupid tourists like me, but I’ve been shown plenty of forgeries in my travels and they generally look good, with letters clearly visible and such, whereas this one looks a little too worn and bent by thousands of people stepping on it to make the trick worth it (probably about $10 by my reckoning based on eBay offers for ones in much better condition). Not a treasure exactly, and in its current foot-abused state of negligible archeological value (else I would have, ahem, turned it in to the authorities) but to grasp history serendipitously, and why me? Why now? This just made my day!
There’s no way I can do justice to the sheer volume of Classical Art in Rome, so I won’t even try. The Capitoline Museum, Borghese, countless cathedrals, … you will be overwhelmed by it, eyes and soul beaten to pure submission so you can barely issue a yelp of protest at the beauty in which you’re drowning. I will only say that on my first day in Rome I waited 2 hours in line to get into the Vatican Museum, and I have absolutely no regrets. Seeing this was an absolute “Aha!” moment for me:
And sorry, no pictures of the Sistine Chapel (it’s forbidden) to which this mere hallway led — — when you emerge into it you simply gawk in awe upwards at Adam touching the hand of God and the surrounding universe of imagery and forget where you came from.
Hidden Gems
Walking through the streets of Rome is like no other city I’ve been in. I mean New York is fast and vibrant, San Francisco friendly and upbeat, but Rome surprises you in a very peaceful, contemplative way. Like casually looking to your right, you see an alleyway entrance to an apartment building, and there’s a classical statue at the end in a little garden. Very nice!
Now this building across the street is most interesting, and the guard looks rightly serious about his job:
My usual gripe on the shortage of public restrooms in modern cities applies, but if you’re thirsty there’s a very nice thing in Rome: public fountains!
It has admittedly been decades since I dared drink from a public water fountain in the U.S., where the stale metallic quality in e.g. Central Park is like from a gym locker, but the water out of those Roman fountains is definitely decent! (after observing many others drinking first, of course).
I have to say I was not impressed with many of my compatriots (surmised by their accents) along the way — — one family accused us of ‘cutting the line’ at the Colosseum, which was patently false, and quite publicly made a ridiculous holier-than-thou scene of it. At restaurants there was almost always a very loud table of Americans with the worst language I have heard outside a drunken frat party. And at the Pantheon one very American-looking woman marched right up to the guard well after closing time and demanded “I want to go in there!” If the patience of the Romans hasn’t caved in by now, it must only be due to the compensating dollars rolling in, but that makes me a bit ashamed.
All I will say is I had pizza every day and never got sick of it! And that was of course just 1% of what we enjoyed …

Ultimate Guide to the Best Places to Run in the World's Major Cities and Destinations. www.greatruns.com @greatruns by Mark Lowenstein

Rome is one of the world’s great cities to visit. Filled with antiquities, wonderful historic sites, lovely old neighborhoods and great restaurants, it’s also a fantastic walking city. The running scene has been improving. Yes, there are busy, traffic-choked roads, tangled lanes difficult to navigate, and the air quality can be poor in the summer — but there are great places to run within proximity to where most travelers stay. Highlights of Rome running include a nearly 9-mile “Rome Sights” tour, including some of the principal landmarks and historic sites (go early or on Sundays!). Running along the Tiber River can be a pleasure, especially since a bike path along part of it was put in a few years ago. Rome’s three largest parks - Borghese, Ada, and Pamphili are also terrific for running. And running on the historic Via Appia Antica and the Parco de Caffarella is one of the most unique runs in the world.
Running in Rome will undoubtedly incorporate some of its famous “seven hills” east of the Tiber, as well as Vatican Hill and Janiculum northwest of the river. In terms of public transport, there is are two metro lines, which go round rather than through the historic city. There’s an extensive bus system.
Rome’s weather is Mediterranean. Summers are hot and dry and can be uncomfortable for running. Spring and fall is almost perfect for running. Winters are mild to cool but rarely cold, with moderate rain. Snow and freezing temperatures are rare.
8.6 miles,with options. Start: near St. Peter’s Square or any point. MAP
This is an attempt to put together a tour of some of Rome’s principal sights. Best to do it early before the streets get crowded and to beat the heat. See this as a ‘city tour’, and take your time! The map starts at Ospedale Santo Spirito, right near St. Peter’s Square, or at any point convenient to where you’re staying. The route follows the outskirts of St. Peter’s and Vatican City (without going into it). Then, just off Via Crescenzio is Castel St. Angelo. Cross the Ponte Cavour, over to the Spanish Steps and the Piazza de Spagna. Then, over to the Trevi Fountain and the Piazza Venezia & Piazza St. Marco. Skirt the Capitoline and the Roman Forum by running along Via dei Fori Imperiali to do a tour of the Coloseum, and then through the Circus Maximus.
Shorter option: take a right out of the Circus Maximus and head over to the famous Ponte Palatino. Cross the bridge and return to St. Peter’s along the river path.,Longer option: takes you through the Trastevere area, near the Passeggiata del Gianicolo, and via Garibaldi back down to the river. Add on even more by going up to Villa Doria Pamphili park.
7 miles ONE-WAY. MAP Start: North: Stado Olimpico. South: Ponte Guglielmo Marconi
Running along the Tiber River in Rome is a great way to go for a run and see the city without dealing with traffic and intersections. Several years ago, the city completed a bike path that runs nearly 7 miles from near Olympic Stadium to Ponte Guglielmo Marconi.
The trail runs through the heart of the most visited sections of the city, but below the roads. It’s a great way to do a dedicated run or to use it as a link to other sites or routes. Note that the path can get flooded fairly easily, often leaving behind a muddy mess. The northern section of the path officially starts south of Olympic Stadium but we start the run at the stadium, since it’s a thrill to see it and do a lap around the track. The southern section concludes at the Ponte Guglielmo Marconi. It is also possible to run on the eastern section of the Tiber.
7 miles Out and Back. Start: Circus Maximus Metro Station. MAP
The Appian Way is one of the earliest and most strategic roads of the Roman Republic. Sections of it remain, and it makes for a one-of-a-kind run. Even the marathon in the 1960 Rome Olympics had a section on this road. On a map, it is called “Via Appia Antica”. The surface is the original stone slab, which can be a challenging surface after a time. However, there is a path alongside for much of the way to ease the run. It is possible to run about six miles south to the perimeter road. The road is generally quiet and is closed to cars on Sundays. Our route starts at the Circus Maximus metro station. A nice option is a loop around the Circus Maximus or use the river path. Viale delle Terme di Caracalla is a good option on the return.
A great option is to combine the Appia with the miles of paths in gorgeous Parco Della Caffarella, where you can combine a run with a visit to the Catacombs. The park is more rural and agricultural in nature, with dirt paths though gorgeous green fields. A very different feel than the busy center city or the more manicured Roman parks such as Villa Ada.
~3 miles. Start: Piazza del Popolo, or Spanish Steps/Porta Pinciana. MAPAdd-Ons: Villa Ada Park, or paths along Tiber River.
At 148 acres, this is the third largest park in Rome. It is centrally located and makes for a great run. It’s possible put together a run of about 3 miles along the paths of the Villa Borghese. Sites include the Villa Borghese Gallery, lovely gardens, Museum of Modern Art, boating lake, and Piazza Napoleone. The paths are wide and gravel, and fairly shaded. Due to its central location, Borghese can be accessed via the Piazza del Popolo or the Spanish Steps/Porta Pinciana, among other options. A nice add-on/combination run is Villa Ada, which is another large park in Rome, less than 2 miles away. Use Via Salaria or Viale Romania. Guided walking tour here.
3 miles of paths. Start: Piazza Bligny. Easily accessed via bus. MAP
At 450 acres, this is Rome’s second largest park. It is more wooded and less finely manicured than Borghese or Pamphili. A private area is under control of the Egyptian embassy. The park has an artificial lake, a public swimming pool, and one can rent canoes, bikes, or horses. In summer there’s the Rome Meets the World Music Festival and numerous other outdoor concerts. For running, there are numerous paths throughout the park, including the perimeter of the fort, totaling ~3 miles. For a longer run, combine with Villa Borghese Park, taking Via Salaria, Via Panama, or Villa Romania to Via Giaocchino Rossini.
~10k of trails in the park. Start: in park,or accessible from St. Peter’s Square or Trastevere area.
Rome’s largest park, Villa Doria Pamphili, contains a stunning, mid- 17th century palace surrounded by garden mazes, jogging trails, fabulous fountains, a superb grotto, and pine lined views of Rome from atop the Janiculum hill. Note that there are not maps inside the park. Your best bet is to run the perimeter paths, which add up to ~10k. There are bathrooms and water fountains near the park entrances.
Good running options to/from the park: From Ponte Sisto, Via Garibaldi, passing through the Trastevere neighborhood and by important landmarks such as the Piazza de Santa Maria, Basilica di Santa Maria, the floodlit Fontana dell’Acqua Paola, and the Garibaldi statue. Mix it up by going through the Passeggiata del Gianicolo monument with the cannon that goes off at noon, or the switchback road, Passeggiata del Gianicolo. This makes for a ~2.5 mile loop, to and from the park.
2–3 miles within site. 2 miles to sea and then along water for 1–2 miles.
Ostia Antica was the harbor city of ancient Rome. It is now a well-preserved archaeological site, about about 18 miles northeast of the city and 2 miles from the Mediterranean. It is a popular tourist destination due to its ancient buildings, frescoes, and mosaics. It’s also easily reachable from Rome via a 1/2 hour train ride and is only a few km from the airport. Ostia Antica makes for a good running option along its ancient roads. The stone surface is similar to the Appian Way, although there is grass/dirt on the side as well. It is about 1.2 miles from one end to the other in the Ostia Antica site (admission required). There are numerous add-on options. There are lovely farm fields on either side of the Antica site. Or, run to the sea, about 2 miles, and then along the water, where there is a separated bike path from Faber Beach to the port, and then a nice jaunt out to the harbor.
Like any major European city frequented by tourists, there is a huge choice of places to stay. Pretty much anywhere you stay in the most visited parts of Rome will provide access to some of the runs in this guide. A few recommendations, for runners.
There are not as many specialty running stores in Rome as in other cities of its size. Each of the major running companies — Adidas, New Balance, Puma, and Nike has a store neat the Villa Borghese. A few of the specialty stores.
Footworks. Centrally located in San Giovanni area. Also close to Villa Ada and Parco Caffarella.
Born to Race. 2.5 miles south of Vila Doria Pamphili
LBM Sport. 1.5 miles north of the Via Appia
Rome has guided tours. And here.
AUR Runs Rome. The American University in Rome has an active club and meets regularly for group runs.
A.S.D. Roma Road Runners Club
Rome Marathon. April. Gorgeous race through the heart of some of Rome’s great sights.
Ostia Half Marathon. The varied course ROUTE is a fast one with some light up-and-down hill stretches. Starting near Palazzo dello Sport, the route runs in Rome, through the entire length of via Cristoforo Colombo then up and down the seafront, 280m each way, to the finish line at the round-about. (La Rotonda).
Rome Appia Run. April.

I don’t know many people who don’t love Italian food.
The pizza. The pasta. And the produce — just ask anyone who has visited an Italian market to describe what they saw there and watch them get all misty-eyed about bitter greens and parmesan. It’s a sight to see — both the markets and people’s reactions to them.
I recently took my fourth trip to Rome. This is a city that grabbed me by the stomach during my first visit in 2008 and has never let go.
It sounds like a cliché but Romans know how to eat and drink very well. It’s what keeps me coming back more than anything else. You can lead this horse to the Colosseum or the Vatican if you must, but I will only drink from the well of Roman food and drink culture.
30,000 steps a day around the city gave me ample time to reflect on how Rome just gets food and drink right. It’s a pleasure here, not a chore. It’s a way of life, not an inconvenience.
And we could learn a thing or two from that.
Start the day in a café, those quintessential third spaces Italy holds so dear.

Hey there, fellow history enthusiasts! Today, I want to take you on a journey through time and explore the forgotten history of one of the most legendary cities in the world – Rome. So grab a drink, sit back, and let's dive right in!
When you think of Rome, you probably envision grand architecture, gladiators, and legendary rulers like Julius Caesar. But did you know that Rome's history stretches far beyond the commonly known spectacular ruins? It's time to unveil some fascinating forgotten secrets!
To start, let's talk about the early beginnings of Rome. It all began as a small village on the banks of the Tiber River in the 8th century B.C. As I'm sure you can imagine, it's come a long way since then!
One of the most significant periods in Roman history was the establishment of the Roman Republic. It was a time of ambitious politicians, mighty generals, and the birth of true democracy. The Romans were all about the law and order, and they did it with style!
Speaking of style, let's not forget about the lesser-known side of Rome – the fashion! Romans were trendsetters of their time, known for their luxurious clothing, intricate jewelry, and even fashionable footwear.
Of course, we can't talk about Rome without mentioning the iconic Colosseum. This incredible structure served as a…

Intro: This is Citations Needed with Nima Shirazi and Adam Johnson.
Nima: Welcome to the Citations Needed live show Beg-a-Thon. Citations Needed is, of course, a podcast on the media, power, PR, and the history of bullshit. As I said, this is one of our periodic Beg-a-Thons, our virtual live show fundraisers. And we’re so glad that you are joining us tonight. Thank you, everyone. I am Nima Shirazi.
Adam: I’m Adam Johnson.
Nima: It’s great to have you all here with us. Of course, you can follow the show on Twitter and Bluesky @citationspod, Facebook Citations Needed, and become a supporter of the show if you’re not already, and this is a Beg-a-Thon, so we obviously would really like you to become a supporter, through Patreon.com/CitationsNeededPodcast. All your support through Patreon is so incredibly appreciated as we are 100% listener funded.
Adam: Yes, and if you become a supporter on Patreon, which, again, is ostensibly the purpose of this Beg-a-Thon, in addition to delightful conversation, edifying everyone, you get access to over 160 News Briefs, show notes and more fun stuff, special episodes, little things we do here and there, live shows, live chats, etc. But most importantly, you get to put your head on the pillow at night and go to sleep knowing that you supported our humble podcast.
Nima: That’s right. And tonight, on Citations Needed, we will be talking about how Elon Musk and his MAGA incel army have appropriated the cultural imagery and aesthetics of Ancient Rome, while obviously neither knowing or understanding anything about the ancient world beyond what maybe they’ve seen in Gladiator or 300.
Adam: To just sort of orient the audience, Trump World, and now increasingly, Elon Musk is effectively the co-vice president, are obsessed with evoking Roman symbols, iconography, to advance a fascist political agenda. I think it’s fair to use the F-word, fascist. We’re going to use that. I know some people dispute that, but I think I don’t really know what else to call it at this point. White nationalist, at the very least. And they present Rome and view Rome, either in meme format or explicitly, there’s even kind of a cottage industry of pseudo-intellectual scholars we can kind of get into as well who pander to these people, YouTubers, etc. They present it as a kind of the platonic ideal of a quote-unquote “Western civilization.” Everyone has their place. There’s a, you know, the kind of Nietzschean values of conquest and domination, how they view the world as being about, you know, rewarding the people with the most merit and the most honor, blah, blah, blah. And we covered this back in 2019 with today’s special guest. And there’s obviously been a lot of that, has gotten charged and heightened lately. And so we wanted to kind of bring her back also, because she has a wonderful book out that I have read. You should definitely read it too. It is excellent.
Nima: It is so good, and we’re going to be promoting it all night. So who are we talking about, Adam? We’re talking about our guest tonight, Dr. Sarah E. bond, Associate Professor in the Classics at the University of Iowa. Hey, Sarah, good to see you. Sarah joins us again after about five and a half years, she was on Episode 82, way back in July of 2019, in the before times, for our show, which was entitled “‘Western Civilization’ and White Supremacy: The Right-Wing Co-option of Antiquity.” So it is amazing to have you back. You, Sarah, are the author, as we said, of the new book Strike: Labor, Unions, and Resistance in the Roman Empire, which is out now from Yale University Press. I’m so excited to get to our conversation with you, Sarah.
But before we do that, we just want to note why we’re doing this tonight, this Beg-a-Thon, this kind of fundraiser that we do periodically. Citations Needed takes a team to make and it takes a ton of work to do each episode. Not many shows do the research that we do at the pace we do it, and since we started the show back in July of 2017, we’ve released well over 200 episodes, more than 160 News Briefs. We’ve welcomed more than 300 guests. We love doing this. We are grateful for each and every listener, every download, every like, every share, tens of thousands of you wonderful people listen to the show every week, and we cannot thank you enough for that. It is amazing. But only a tiny fraction of you actually support the show and our team through Patreon, which is the way that we’re able to keep doing this. And so that is why we are holding this Beg-a-Thon, as we call it, tonight.
Adam: So that was the good cop. I’m gonna do the bad cop. Listen, you mooches. No, I’m just kidding. I’m not gonna neg you, except to say that we are 100% user supported. We get no corporate sponsorships. We get no foundations. I’ll spare you the sanctimonious spiel, but you get the general idea. So if you do listen and you do like it, it actually is very, very helpful if you actually do support it, because, you know, there’s just not a lot of, of the people who listen, just not a high percentage do, and listen consistently. And yes, we have the data, and we’ve geolocated you. We know who you are.
Nima: [Laughs] That’s right. So tonight, we’re asking, if you are able, to please go to our Patreon page. We’ll put the link up there, but it’s very easy to find. It’s Patreon.com/CitationsNeededPodcast. Go help us out there. All right, enough of this garbage. Adam, let’s get to the show.
Adam: Yeah. Let’s get to the show itself. So tonight we are focusing on, again, we are using as a framing device the popularity of our new South African co-president Elon Musk and his minions and his incel army, with Roman iconography and alleged history as a gateway to talk about what is a far richer, more interesting vision of Rome that you’ve written, this excellent book you’ve written, which we’ll get into. So we’re going to start with that hook, and then kind of get into what you wrote about, which is obviously meant to, in some ways, kind of be a counter to that cheesy narrative, which I’m sure we can talk about. So we’re just going to give a little bit of background, Nima.
Nima: Yeah, sure.
Adam: If you want to sort of take over that part, because I know you had the unfortunate task of gathering that background information unfortunately.
Nima: So you know this idea of fascistic elements, neo-Nazis, in the US, namely their collective, now chief avatar, effective President of the United States, Elon Musk, the richest man in the world. They’ve been adopting and co-opting and misunderstanding the aesthetics of Ancient Rome, kind of as a rule, but as a distinct part of their fascistic political project. And one of the most prominent examples of this occurred after Elon Musk himself did a very clear Sieg Heil gesture three times during the inauguration of Donald Trump in January of 2025. Now Musk’s ally, Andrea Stroppa, who lives in Italy and claims to have an advisory role in some of Musk’s companies, posited that’s Musk Sieg Heil was was merely a Roman salute. Stroppa wrote in a now-deleted Tweet, quote, “Roman Empire is back, starting from Roman salute.”
Adam: Now, this was far from the first time that Musk had cited Rome to justify his reactionary ideology and paranoid xenophobia and deeply, deeply unfunny jokes. The guy’s constitutionally incapable of being funny, which is quite a feat. At least Trump’s funny, I guess. Now our guest, Dr. Bond, wrote for the arts news and analysis site Hyperallergic, we’re sorry, we’re going to quote you back at you. It’s one of the ultimate sins of podcasting, but we’re going to do it. Quote,
Musk has a long history of referencing the Roman Empire. His brand of technocratic despotism and its social media iconography has roots in the work of 20th-century European fascists, who were themselves fixated on Ancient Rome. He has long been obsessed with the late Roman Republic dictator Sulla and in December even changed his X avatar to “Kekius Maximus” — a Romanized version of Pepe the Frog dressed in military garb similar to that of Maximus in the film Gladiator (2000). Like Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, the billionaire has frequently expressed admiration for the Roman Empire, posting AI pictures of himself cosplaying as a Roman soldier…
God, that’s sad. You didn’t write that, that’s me, sorry.
…and cooking up theories about why Ancient Rome fell (answer: severe decline in birth rate). He thinks about it every day.
End quote. So let’s begin. I want to sort of bring in Sarah here.
Nima: Yeah, let’s do it.
Adam: We’ve set the table. Before we get into the questions about the actual book you wrote, forgive us, I want you to sort of comment on this piece, what you think superficially people find attractive. I know the elements are kind of obvious, but I want you to kind of dive into why you wrote this piece, why you think it’s important to engage as a historian of Rome with this seemingly popular current on the Nazi, or Nazi-adjacent Right.
Sarah E. Bond: Right, so the piece that I wrote for Hyperallergic, I wrote with Stephanie Wong, who is also a professor of history. She just graduated from Brown. And we write a lot together, because I think that our perspectives are very aligned, and we’re good at writing together, but we had been for years now, because we’ve been, gosh, we’ve been writing and collaborating for six years together, and so we decided that we were going to just collect all the things that he said since about 2020, about Ancient Rome, because I have just a gigantic digital folder of references to Ancient Rome that politicians have made over the years. And many of us who do a lot of reception history, which is just a fancy word for saying how things are repackaged and reused from the ancient world. We had been keeping track of it, and we had written an article together for MSNBC a few years, let’s see, a year and a half ago, on that meme about why people think about the Roman Empire.
And the person that Elon Musk thinks about the most seems to be Sulla, who was a dictator in the middle and early first century BCE. And Sulla eventually does give up power and is not assassinated. He eventually gives it up and retires and hands what’s left of the Republic over to Crassus and Cicero, I’m sorry, Crassus and Pompey, essentially, as the next consoles. But he’s obsessed with Sulla, and that really set off alarm bells in my head, because Sulla wiped out all of his political enemies by the hundreds. And this is something called the proscriptions, and Julius Caesar refuses to do the proscriptions when he becomes dictātor, or dictator, but it is picked back up again as a practice by Octavian Augustus. And so this idea that you can just wipe out all of your enemies and kill them and give people free rein to kill them is something that he’s idealizing, and it seems to be that he’s fixating a lot on. And especially with the purge of the federal government that’s been going on for the past, guys, can you believe that Trump has been president for a month, exactly, almost? It feels like it’s been five years.
Nima: It feels like it’s been 2,000 years.
Sarah E. Bond: It has been four weeks of nonstop layoffs and nonstop purging of the federal government. And I don’t think that’s the same in any way as killing people via the proscriptions, but I do think that Elon Musk likes to make people vulnerable to attack.
Adam: Yeah. Unless you fly a plane. Or rather fly on a plane, I should say.
Sarah E. Bond: I should just say with Elon Musk that we’re talking about aesthetics and idealizing. But I just want to point out something really huge here that was covered by Maya Pontone on Hyperallergic as well, with background from many researchers, myself included, is that Elon Musk has started to give money specifically to archeological projects and projects focused on the ancient world, and that there is a pipeline that is being created from the world of classics into, directly, the world of Elon Musk and this DOGE palace that he’s creating for himself, that we can’t just say that this is a fantasy that he’s playing out, that he gave over $2 million to the Vesuvius Challenge, which decoded a small amount of the papyri from Herculaneum and gave prize money to a young AI engineer named Luke Farritor. And Luke Farritor now works with DOGE and was one of the six engineers that originally went in with Musk a few weeks ago. So it’s not as though we can say, in the world of classics, Oh, we’re just, you know, he idealizes us, but we’re mutually exclusive. We’re in a bubble out here. What can we do about it? It’s like, No, we have people who are taking the money of Musk, the Vesuvius Challenge, as well as, there’s another called the AIRC in Rome, who has also taken money from Musk, and so he’s funding cultural heritage and AI as a way of accessing people that are involved with the ancient world. And you know, it matters who we take money from. It very much matters.
Adam: There’s a risk there, because, again, he did this. He’s obviously done this for years with STEM, where he throws so much money around that your favorite science channel will do these sycophantic reports on him. Science media will do sycophantic reports on him. They’ll get an interview with him and gush over him, even this is, like, sort of post-overt Nazi stuff. And so, yeah, I mean, when you have, again, $400 billion in debt worth, obviously, it’s not totally liquid, but it’s, you know, he could, he could take a loan against it anytime he wants. And, you know, controlling the past is, is because not to be too sort of, you know, I don’t want to be too overly precious–
Nima: You can rage against the machine. It’s okay.
Adam: Well. I mean, you know, He who controls the present controls the past. He who controls the past controls the future. I do think it matters, because then we’re going to be curated. It’s going to be curated, presented in a way that flatters his ideological dispositions.
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, and we’re already seeing that. We have Trump firing the archivist of the United States after she had already deleted and moved around parts of an exhibit that was within the National Archives. And he still fired her. But she had gone in and edited parts of history that were negative, right? And so the presentation of history and the people that are in control of it is what he wants access to, and he wants good press for sure, and he’s trying to buy himself a connection to antiquity in order to conjure legitimacy that we’ve already seen. This is the same MO that Mussolini took to legitimize his power and his rise within fascist Italy.
Adam: He’s basically–
Sarah E. Bond: All you have to do, yeah, you just rebuild the Ara Pacis, right? Rebuild the Res Gestae Divi Augusti, which is exactly what Mussolini does, is invest so many thousands and millions of dollars into the rebuilding of the Roman Forum and the rebuilding of the Roman senate house. This is a playbook we’ve already seen before, because he has no legitimate status within the federal government. So he’s clinging to what he perceives as the only legitimacy that he cares about, which is power from the ancient world.
Nima: Talking about preserving the past and also, you know, as we’re going to get into kind of who is allowed to control our understanding of the past. And we’re going to get into this, this idea of, you know, whether from imperial historians kind of empowered and sponsored to tell the official history of Rome, to this kind of idea of history from below, which you tell through your work, Sarah. I’d love to kind of discuss the overall thesis of your book, which really shows how class conflict and the organized withholding of labor was a consistent feature of Roman life, as were slave revolts, military strikes, other forms of resistance, much of which has been erased or at least reduced to individual stories of heroism in kind of broader ancient, historical retellings, and certainly in the popular mind. How those who don’t study this so closely kind of understand the ancient world, and then certainly Ancient Rome. So what compelled you to write this new book Strike, and what broad image of Rome, both in our pop culture and in kind of more historical consensus, were you attempting to illuminate and edify for us?
Sarah E. Bond: I was going back and re-reading an economic history of Rome from a guy named Tenney Frank, and he was a racist from the turn of the 20th century, like into the 20th century. And, I think it’s 1920, he writes an economic history of Rome, and he thinks that strikes cannot happen because of the number of enslaved people within the Roman Empire. And we do know that within the Italic peninsula, for instance, up to 25% of the population, especially during the the period of the High Roman Empire, so the first two centuries CE, have a large number of enslaved people. And even prior to that, there was a large number. And so he thought that because there were enslaved people, there could never be strikes, because every time you would have artisans going on strike, why wouldn’t you just replace them with other enslaved persons? And that really discounted the professionalization of enslaved people as potters, as weavers, as textile workers, as carpenters, as tavern workers and owners. And his belief that there weren’t strikes kind of infuriated me, and led me to read more about what people thought about strikes, about withholding labor, and what it might have been called in the ancient world.
And it was surprising to me that there just had been so little written on collective action and the withholding of labor in the ancient world, because many people, both Marxists and non-Marxists, had thought that there really weren’t a lot of instances of it. And so in the 19th century, Marx and Engels had believed that the first strikes ever had been the plebeians during what we call the Struggle of the Orders, which really starts in 495 BCE. And if we’re trying to place that, that’s about 15 years after the start of the Roman Republic. So 509, the Roman Republic starts. The last king of Rome is ousted, and we have the start of something we call the res publica, or the republic. And a few years after that, we have the plebeians and the patricians fighting against each other because the patricians are extremely wealthy and they have a lot of power, but also they have a lot of both soft and hard power, in that they monopolize all the magistracies, the consulship, the pontifical colleges, all of the major magistracies, the patricians are, are really dominating.
And so I looked at the Struggle of the Orders, but thought to myself, I think there has to be many more instances of this happening. And so starting to look through things that really didn’t make it into the traditional literary historical record, like papyri and inscriptions, really was the access point to find out that, especially in the Greek world, and going all the way back to the Egyptian world, this had been happening for many thousands of years. And so I started tracing backwards and forwards and finding that there were a lot more instances, because a strike by any other name is still a strike. And so even though the word is not coined until the 18th century in England, because it’s referring to the striking of the top sails of merchant ships in the 18th century, even though that word does not exist in Ancient Rome, that you still have the withholding of labor and the boycotting of certain assigned things like the military levy through calling it a secessio, where we get, for instance, the word secession from. But then when you look in the Greek papyri, they’re calling it an anachoresis, which just means a withdrawal. And for many hundreds and thousands of years, we’ve had workers, especially in Egypt, refusing to work unless they were given emmer and wheat and the right amount of staples to keep working. Sometimes they would just go sit in the back of a temple.
And so for me, it was saying modern people think that strikes are a development of the progressive modern Western civilization post-Industrial Revolution, and as is my wont, I usually like to say to most things, Well, that sounds like bullshit, that that we have created this idea of progressive structure to get to the period that we are now, even though it does not feel that we are in a progressive moment in the least, and to try and unpack why we think that unions and strikes and labor withdrawals, that all of these things are a much more modern development in order to really make us feel a little bit more successful as individuals. And I think we just have to give more credit to the Romans.
Nima: Yeah, I love the idea that, like, a strike by any other name is still a strike that, even if they don’t use that term, because, you know, you actually start your book by talking about how the term was coined, the striking of sails in a British port. But then going back to Deir el-Medina, the strike in Egypt, and then kind of tracing that up through history is just, I think, really, really fascinating to see how, in a world that is built on the on the backs of laborers, the power that is held through withholding labor, has been recognized, not just, you know, since the Industrial Revolution, but you know, for thousands and thousands of years.
Adam: On some level, the idea that people around the world would withhold labor is, it does seem sort of self-evidently obvious, because what other leverage do you have as a laborer? And 99% of humans throughout history have been laborers, typically exploited in any kind of semi-developed sense that would be exploited by some rich asshole who lived on the hill. It doesn’t. It’s not a huge leap to say that this is a kind of universal, that there’s an evolutionary convergence to land on some form of strike, right? And what you argue is that while that is true, there was also more sophisticated antecedents that made these more coordinated, more and more sophisticated than we maybe thought.
And one of the things we talk about is these associations, which were both kind of, which were not these kind of perfect Marxist organizations, in the sense that they were oftentimes kind of business trade groups. They didn’t fit along these kind of perfectly, you know, Maoist lines, but in many ways they what you do argue is that they could be instrumentalized to carry out something we would recognize as a labor strike, and that because of the way history is written, you specifically talk about Levy and others, because of the inherently elite nature of reading and writing and how history is created, the first draft, second draft, third draft, that those stories get flattened or obscured.
And you even have this great section, I won’t read it back to you, because I’d like you to talk about it, about the ways in which mob violence is flattened. When you say that oftentimes, as a class dimension, that is fairly obvious, but in the history books, it’s kind of written off as just mob violence. And you even draw some parallels to current examples, when mass unrest is sort of stripped of its ideology, which I thought was a really fascinating, really interesting part of the book. Can you talk about the ways in which–
Nima: Cicero was just doing what the New York Times does now.
Adam: Well, yeah, by the way, I found out he did, The the shrimp store called and they’re running out of you, The jerk store called, where he would, I didn’t realize this until I read Mary Beard’s book, that he would write what he said on the Senate floor later on, which seems like cheating. And then people presented it as like, He’s this great orator, and it’s like, You just got to go back and rewrite it. Anyway. Talk, if you could, about the these associations, how they provided the kind of framework to make a more sophisticated form of labor unrest, and if you could also talk about the ways in which historians, for obvious reasons, who were wealthy or patrician or what have you, decided to kind of say, Oh, that was just mindless, ideology-free violence.
Sarah E. Bond: I think when we create homogenous groups, when we call everybody a mob, that’s already a pejorative, it’s already casting them into negative rhetoric. And the Romans are no different. They like to use very large, amalgamous nouns, a turba, a multitudo, that is to just say, a gigantic negative word for a crowd, right? And when you just say crowd, you aren’t allowing for organization, you aren’t allowing for hierarchy, you aren’t allowing for structure. And although we don’t get a ton of anatomies of crowds from the ancient world, we can see, especially in the late Republic, that a lot of groups that are coming together, what we call collegia, and that’s where we get the modern word college from. A collegium, in the singular, is just a group of people. In Roman law, you have to be three or more people to be considered a collegium. And we have about 3,200 inscriptions in papyri that give reference to these various groups that really grow in number in the early Hellenistic period forward.
So from the death of Alexander the Great forward, people increasingly are creating groups for various reasons. So you could have a group that is focused on Dionysus, because who doesn’t want to get together and drink some wine and have a nice bacchanalia? But you could also form a group, if you were merchants or trades people living on the island of Delos, and you’re human traffickers, and you need to have a workflow, essentially, that moves people throughout the Mediterranean. You can move bread through it, in terms of wheat and flour, you may need to have a supply chain to give you precious jewels, pepper, cinnamon, lots of things that you might want to trade, or you might just be a carpenter and want to have other carpenters that you work with.
And so these collegia are proliferating, especially into the period of the Republic. Many of them don’t have enough money to meet in a proper schola, which is a clubhouse. And so lots of them do what many confraternities have always done, and that is meet in a public house, called a pub. And so you go to a tavern, the tavern keeper allows you to sit there and to congregate. And when we try and understand the movements within the late Republic, one of the things that I think is important to see is that these groups are coming together extremely quickly, in a very organized manner, in order to hear public speeches called contiones. And so my question is, Okay, we have rhetoricians like Cicero, who’s calling them just a gigantic mob, but in reality, he’s giving us clues that say that they’re starting in a specific sector that artisans are known to live within, and that the tavern keepers are involved in it. And to me, trying to reconstruct the underlying structure is very important, because a lot of that gets erased in the name of marginalizing them. And marginalizing vocabulary is something that we’ve seen, especially since 2020. When you marginalize a crowd, we saw this even with Occupy Wall Street as well, is that, yes, Occupy Wall Street actually was quite organized, even though, yes, they were very against hierarchy and a lot of the traditional leadership structures, but we really see that it’s elite people who tend to call crowds mobs.
So whether it’s Black Lives Matter, whether it’s any other social movement, it deprives them and really robs them of their peaceful protest and of their organization. And I think that this is something that always has happened, is that really wealthy people, if you want to completely marginalize a movement, you just simply call them a mob. And that just is an unjust way to label many groups, not all groups, but I think a lot of groups have been robbed of their legitimacy by being called a mob, because immediately you think of violence and criminality and also anti-patriotism, and that’s something that with unions, for instance, if we go back to Garfield, President Garfield, not the cat. I mean, I like the cat, too.
Adam: No relation.
Sarah E. Bond: No, no relation. President Garfield, he hated unions, and he thought they were unpatriotic, and he thought of them as just individuals who incited mob violence. And so it’s not hard to trace and to track down the ways in which we marginalize groups of people, individually, but also groups that are coming together in order to fight for their rights.
Nima: But it’s not just in rhetoric, right, Sarah? I mean, because also then the discourse and the language and the denigration also turns into policy or legislation, and we see that now, you know, with anti-protest legislation across the country, whether that is, you know, from campus protests against genocide in Palestine or, you know, long before, anti-assembly legislation. But you also talked about this in your book Strike, about how the elites and the wealthy call associations or call, you know, regular people getting together, not only a mob, but then they kind of legislate against it. Talk about where that came from, and some of the parallels there.
Sarah E. Bond: I think we’re all thinking about anti-assembly legislation, especially since October 7, and thinking about groups coming together and protesting against the treatment of Palestinians especially. I visited the groups that were on the quad at the University of Chicago. We had a very small group at the University of Iowa, for instance, and many campuses across the country were. Pushing them off of public property. Now, the University of Chicago is a private school. That’s a little bit different, but we even saw this at public schools that people were getting arrested, that they were not allowed to assemble, even when they were just peaceably in their tents and just sitting there.
So I think that we’ve been thinking about freedom of assembly and whether that is a civil right and to what extent it should be protected. And when we go back to the ancient world, we see that freedom of assembly was something that very wealthy elite people like senators and the emperor were very, very anxious about. And it’s not something that is new, that, especially for instance, Julius Caesar and Octavian moved to make legislation very soon into their periods of rule that say, Okay, well, you know, collegia, maybe they can, they can meet at certain times, but predominantly we’re going to have them disband unless they’re the oldest collegia that have ever been established, and if they have a public utility, right?
And this idea of the civic good that a collegium has to serve the civic good, it’s tying into this idea of patriotism, again, is that freedom of assembly is only extended if it is for the good of the res publica, but when you get into the Empire, the res publica does not really exist anymore. It’s a false reconstruction that Augustus has made, right? He calls it the reconstruction of the res publica, but come on, it’s an empire. It is the empire that he is building, and he is the imperator. And so what he’s really saying when he disbands collegia and when he begins to threaten freedom of assembly more and more, is that I don’t want myself threatened by this, and I don’t want any public discord that might turn into resistance against me.
And the smothering of resistance before it can really ever get a lot of steam is just something that is quite common within the Roman Empire. People think that they’re, Oh, you know, the Roman Empire was so good to live in that there was just no resistance, right? Like after Spartacus, we have, Oh, very little, except for maybe the Jewish Wars that are in Judea. And that’s just not true, because everyday resistance, the act of forming a union, the act of engaging in a labor strike, right, the act of pushing against this revoking of freedom of assembly, everyday resistance, is just as important as these gigantic rebellions. They don’t just formulate out of nothing. And so I think that freedom of assembly has always been revoked and questioned and placed as something unpatriotic, because those in power have always known that when people get together, they have more power collectively than they do apart, and that’s why the motto of the United States is E Pluribus Unum, one out of many. And right now, we’re seeing a shift to just the unum part, but not really the people as much a part of it. So that’s something that is really scary to see Trump tweet out, “LONG LIVE THE KING!” It was something that gave me chills, because I immediately thought of the late Roman Republic.
Adam: So I want to sort of back up here a little bit and sort of maybe circle back with what we talked about with your book, with the sort of more topical themes about the rightwing fascination with Rome. And it’s superficial, albeit superficial, which is, I mean, look. Rome as a sort of idea is the way we sort of perceive the West, right? You know, it wasn’t till the late ’90s that to graduate from Oxford, you had to know Latin. It is, it is the way in which academics and intellectuals and scientists talk to each other, up until, again, whatever, the 1800s. Rome, obviously, is kind of what we what, what is viewed as, as Europe, as a sort of, for want of a better term, white civilization, despite the fact that it, of course, wasn’t one in any meaningful sense. But that’s certainly how it’s been idealized as it’s gone through its various white supremacist historical laundromats throughout the decades. And so it kind of makes sense why people who are kind of adrift, or don’t really have any firm, who aren’t very firmly committed into any kind of ideology, would be drawn to it because of its proximity to, it’s sort of a more politically correct form of white nationalist sort of mythmaking.
And so, in some sense, does it make sense why a sort of mediocre, you know, internet-addled dope like Musk would would, again, superficially be into it. He sort of praised Mike Duncan’s podcast, much to Mike Duncan’s chagrin. It all kind of makes sense, because it is this sort of idealized, white, sort of heroic version of themselves and in a weird way, I know I mentioned her book before, but Mary beard’s book SPQR, at the very end, she has this line that’s clearly in dialogue with that, where she says, I get asked a lot, you know, basically been working on this book for 50 years, I get asked a lot, What do we have to learn from modern society in Rome? And I’m paraphrasing here, forgive me if I’m misrepresenting this. But she kind of says, Basically nothing. And I don’t think she meant that, like in a non-, in a sort of anti-intellectual way. I think she was, it appeared to be in the context it was written to be responding to these people constantly saying we’re at the end of the Roman Empire, because it’s so cliche, right? Isaac Newton said it. I mean, every 10 years we’re, you know, we’re in the end. Everyone likes to talk about the fall of the Roman Empire, because what are you criticizing? Homophobia, right? You sort of, you’re trafficking the idea of, we’re becoming effeminate, we’re becoming weak. Blah, blah, blah, the meme Strong Men Create Good Times, Good Times Create Weak Men.
Sarah E. Bond: A lot of immigration. They really like to harp on immigration.
Nima: That’s right. The barbarians are coming.
Sarah E. Bond: Right. The barbarians at the gates. Yes.
Adam: So if you could, if you would comment a bit about or rather, it’s a little bit open-ended, but I want you to talk about why you think that the mythology, the white supremacist mythology of Rome, appears to be increasing, but has kind of survived and what you think, to what extent do you feel like some, you know, I don’t want you to name names necessarily, but what extent pop history movies have really contributed to that, where they do have this very one-note kind of vision of what, not to sort of blame them for it necessarily, one-note vision of Rome?
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, I did review Gladiator, too. So we just, I mean, I reviewed it for Hyperallergic and I think a lot of the misconceptions about Rome are very entertaining. That when it goes on film, who doesn’t like watching the first Gladiator in the year 2000? And all of the things that are being picked up on and received, right as it’s being filmed at the end of the Clinton administration, is talking about, We can bring Rome back. We can bring the Republic back. Now that’s absolute bullshit, because Marcus Aurelius, in no way ever wants to bring back the Republic. There is no hint of evidence. He had always set Commodus as being the one that was going to be his successor. But this idea that the Republic could come back, that was a romantic idea of the year 2000 that then resurfaces this year with the latest Gladiator, 25 years later, really, 24 years later, coming to the surface, this idea that the Republic could come back. So I think that there are some people who really want to see a genuine resurfacing of proper governance, or some sort of governance that people influence in some way. And so I’m not saying that Gladiator II is completely innocuous, because there are a lot of things wrong with that movie, but they are entertaining. Whether there were sharks in the amphitheater or not, and there were not sharks in the amphitheater, sorry.
Adam: Aw, boo. Sarah! Let me live the lie.
Sarah E. Bond: You could fill the Colosseum with water. It was watertight. So that’s true, you can have a sea battle in the Colosseum, but there were not sharks.
Adam: They got a little greedy with the sharks. They got a little greedy.
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, the CGI was just too far. So there are innocuous things, I think, like sharks in the Colosseum, that I’m really fine with. It’s just that this love affair with the fall of Rome is this idea that, especially conservatives, but we also have liberals who have written horrendously facile op-eds about the fall of Rome as well, that they can be the prognosticators using history. So they’re not only making themselves look extremely cerebral and extremely knowledgeable about quote-unquote, “Western Civ,” they’re also telling the future, and that gives them a level of power within the public sphere, and what they perceive of as the intellectual community, that gives them some sort of currency that they’ve read Gibbon. Well, who hasn’t read Gibbon? There are a lot of people that have read Gibbon. He published a two-volume set in 1776, guys, okay? There are no spoilers here. Everybody kind of knows what Gibbon has said.
But Gibbon is also speaking about the late 18th century. Everybody who is writing history, including myself, is thinking about the time period that they are living in. And I just think that, going back to this idea of the fall of Rome, is not only regurgitating and recycling Gibbon, which it clearly is, but it’s trying to send out a message that I am the truth teller, so please put your trust in me, and that’s essentially what op-eds are supposed to do anyways, right? Like I’m an opinion writer, I have a thousand words, I’m going to sway you that what I’m telling you is significant. It’s just that they get the history so wrong, especially, I would say when it comes to talking about religion and talking about, also, immigration, and talking about what really brought down different component parts of Rome, because Rome doesn’t fall monolithically together as one. That we have fracturing, that we have going in different directions, that many areas like North Africa stay extremely strong up to the Vandal invasion and things like this. So I mean, it’s just this idea that they can read the tea leaves through their historical abilities. And it’s just very wrong.
Adam: Yeah, and I’m going to read here from the Nixon tapes. He was obsessed with this idea. He ranted about it a lot. Quote,
You ever see what happened, you know what happened to the Greeks? Homosexuality destroyed them. Aristotle was a homo, we all know that. So was Socrates… Do you know what happened to the Romans? The last six Roman emperors were fags.
He concludes by saying,
You see, homosexuality, dope, immorality in general, these are the enemies of strong societies. That’s why the communists and the left-wingers are pushing the stuff: they’re trying to destroy us.
To be fair, I do do that. He’s got me there. But this is, again, this is so cliche. This has been done a billion times. The idea that, so much of the Roman, and you know, people would say, generally, corruption is what they’re really kind of referencing. But really it’s this idea of, again, Musk is obsessed with this idea of feminization. Again, he’s into weird kind of Silicon Valley natalist cults. He’s apparently doing some kind of panspermia experiment to half of California right now. I guess he’s on his 13th kid. And so it’s like this, this idea of, again, immigration, lack of white fertility, homosexuality, is like they all, they want to see it in Rome in a way that, of course, is not there, but that, of course, doesn’t really matter.
Nima: Well, I think what’s interesting also is, is, you know, the obsession with the kind of emperor or or even patrician class from some of the wealthiest people on the planet kind of makes sense, right? There’s a corollary there. It’s not just Musk. Also Mark Zuckerberg names his kids after, you know, Roman emperors. There’s a whole thing, weird thing going on. But, Sarah, I’d love for you to talk about how, how it’s not just, you know, the wealthy that kind of see themselves as part of that tradition, and kind of wanting to bring that back, that kind of makes sense, right? Like the people in charge want to be like the people in charge, but it’s for the workers and the people who glom on to this aesthetic as well, who all see themselves as warriors, not as other kinds of workers, right? I mean, we’re seeing farmers in the United States right now gutted by the cuts that have just been made to USAID. You know, hit hardest. You know, American farmers. That is not the kind of imagination that people storming the Capitol, or people excited about, you know, stanning for Musk on Twitter, like, they’re not seeing themselves as the people. They’re seeing themselves as these kind of like delayed warriors with the, you know, with the helmets and the crest and the Gladius by their side. Like, you know, where do you think that kind of comes from and how, how is that shaped by how we understand history, which I think your book starts to really unpack, like, who the people really are, and how we hear their stories, the kind of people’s history, not only of Rome, but of ourselves.
Sarah E. Bond: I think the idea of the American Dream is that we can always pull ourselves up from our bootstraps and be Musk, I mean, to be the richest man in the world. A lot of people imagine that they are capable of that, and we know that a very small number of people are ever able to ascend from poverty into the very wealthy 1%. And Musk isn’t even somebody, I mean, he comes from a family of emerald mine owners in South Africa. Trump comes from money. These are all nepo babies, okay, but this idea of the American Dream is that if you work hard enough, you can ascend. But part of that also is this idea of masculinity that is inextricably linked to Roman soldiers. And so if we go back to January 6 and the storming of the Capitol, there were people with signs where Trump was dressed like Maximus. Maximus, again, is not a historical figure there. It’s not real. Russell Crowe is playing a fictional character. But they are imagining themselves to be the highest order of masculinity. And the visualization of that, the kind of allegory that we have assigned to masculinity is the Roman centurion. And so, you know, just yesterday, I was looking at the new picture of Odysseus that was released for Christopher Nolan’s new version of The Odyssey. I want to see it. I’m going to see it, right? But Matt Damon has a crested helmet on that is very much not exactly what would have been worn in the Trojan War, but it is a crested helmet that is kind of very much emblematic of later soldiers that that are fighting, because the Greek phalanx and Sparta, etc., also is a symbol of masculinity.
And so when you try and question those constructions, people get very upset, because especially white men, tend to idealize both Spartan soldiers and also Roman centurions and soldiers as their everyday lives, like, This is how I should go through life. And these are people that don’t quite realize that if they were transported back to the ancient world, the vast chances are that they would be an enslaved person or a farmer or perhaps an artisan or a potter that’s making ceramics, and many of those also fought as soldiers in the earlier period of The Republic, when we have citizen armies. Enslaved persons usually did not but they were incorporated into the military in other ways. But yeah, I really think that it’s, it’s tied up in aesthetics of masculinity.
And I love that Adam said earlier that this is history laundering instead of money laundering, because that’s just exactly what it is. All of the actual, real colors of history have bled out, right? They’ve faded. They’ve been laundered to death, and now it just doesn’t even look like it actually was. It is a meme, and that’s exactly how memetic things work, is just continue to be recycled until they don’t really resemble the past in any real way. So the book is, in large part, trying to bring back the voices of just regular enslaved peoples, freed people, that is to say people who are manumitted, which is also a large part of the population, and they may not seem as sexy as a centurion, but we have the ability to redefine what sexy is. And I think that merchants who form a collegium and go on strike or sexier to me than a centurion that is running into battle. But yeah, I think there’s many books that are incorporated into this and that have been written and will be written on the reception of Roman history and white supremacy, but I think it all comes down to this feeling that, that this is the ultimate, this is the epitome of what it means to be a man.
Nima: Right. I mean, it’s really interesting that you mentioned, you know, that Russell Crowe is, you know, just an actor. Maximus doesn’t, doesn’t really exist. And in your book, you note that actors actually may have been the first in Ancient Rome to form what could be deemed like a proto-union, right? So, like, again, who is the everyday person, who are the people that are really organizing? Who is afforded the protections? Is it the you know, emperors, or is it the artisans?
Adam: I don’t want to let you go without asking about the viral popularity from 2016, then 2019, then it was huge during COVID, of Marcus Aurelius meditations and like Stoicism as this kind of masculine ideal. Ryan Holiday is kind of a hack writer, wrote a book about it, has a podcast about it.
Sarah E. Bond: We call that Broicism, by the way.
Adam: Broicism, sorry, and this is, apparently, it was, it’s been all the rage, and there was a viral lecture on it that was very sort of rah-rah that went viral during COVID. Again, on some level, one can see I actually read it. It was beyond tedious. But I stuck it out. I definitely don’t meet the the platonic ideal of a Stoic. As those listening to the show may be aware, I sometimes complain. And so I want you, I want to ask a little bit about, again, the sort of cartoon version versus the kind of real version. And it mean, again, these book sales, these podcasts are popular, these TikToks are very popular. This is, this is legitimately popular, and this is the primary entry point into Roman history for a lot of people. So talk, if you could, about the rise of Broicism and how, I don’t know if you, if you engage with this with a lot of undergrads or whatever, and talk about where you see it happen.
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, I want to say, if you’re going to buy a translation of Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations, my professor, whose name is Gregory Hays, I believe, wrote the best translation. So if we’re going to give actual money to anybody for buying Stoicism, and please don’t do those Instagrams that are like Stoicism Every Day, I’m going to send Stoicism and witticisms to your inbox, which half the time they’re fake. They’re fake quotes from Seneca. They’re fake quotes from Cicero. They’re fake quotes from Marcus Aurelius, etc. In any case, translations, who you choose to translate your words are extremely important. So yes, pick your translator carefully, number one. Number two, I think that if we think about technocrats and why this philosophy is extremely alluring to them, we can think about the fact that when you are a Stoic, you have to be happy with your lot in life, and it really behooves technocrats to have coders, to have people that are working within their companies, have a philosophy where they come to work and they’re like, You know, Gosh, darn. I’m just happy to be here. I’m going to be the best coder that I could be, right? And when we read things like Epictetus, then we think, Oh, I will be the best enslaved person that I could possibly be. But let’s face it, when you write the Meditations as Marcus Aurelius, and you say, I’m happy with my lot in life, well, you fucking should be. You are the emperor! You are the emperor! And so Elon Musk adopting Stoicism, which he really is not a Stoic in any stretch of the imagination.
Adam: No, I don’t think Stoics would post 50 tweets a day. Yeah.
Sarah E. Bond: No, no, no. This is not a man that I associate with Stoicism. But many technocrats within the area of the Silicon Valley have begun to glom on to this idea, because it is an opiate of the masses, essentially, as a philosophy. If everybody actually adopted it, then you would have people who aren’t trying to buck the system, that they are not trying to rebel, that they are not trying to modify the system in any way. They are trying individually to work internally on being the best person that they can be, but to reinforce the social hierarchy that already exists. I mean, this is not about transforming the society. It’s about reinforcing the status quo. And right now, the amount of social inequality that we have very much benefits extremely wealthy people. These are just wealthy people that want to maintain their wealth to an even higher degree, and Stoicism is a philosophy that supports their thesis, which is, I am awesome and have a lot of money that I wish to keep. And so they’ve only adopted the philosophy post-thesis.
Nima: And everyone else needs to be cool with that, too.
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, get with it! Come on, guys! This is part of the world that we live in, so just pacify yourself. Go forward and come to the office. Do not stay at home and do not work from home. We want you in an office. We want you doing the tasks that we are asking you to do. And please don’t question it, because questioning leads to disruption, and they don’t want disruption. They simply want to rule. And so yeah, I think Stoicism as a philosophy is very attractive to them and also to people who would like to be wealthy. And as we’ve already kind of talked about, this idea of the American Dream makes people believe that they, too, could be this technocrat in the future. So get with it. But yeah, I don’t think it’s very, I’m much more Epicurean. I know you could probably guess that.
Adam: Yeah. We did a whole episode on the kind of David Goggins, self-help, Tiktok world and again, on some some level, I’m sympathetic, because if there is a drudgery in your job, which, again, I know, I’m sure all of us have here had a drudgery job, you have to hold on to something to sort of make it make sense. But again, there’s a reason why your boss wants you to read Marcus Aurelius, and rather than a union organizer, he’s like, Wait. It’s basically the Mike Rowe sweat pledge. So I want to ask one more question before we go, because we’d be remiss if we didn’t talk about the GOAT, Spartacus, and the Servile Wars and obviously, revolts by enslaved people in general, which, of course, there was quite a few of them. Can we talk a little bit about because again, that would be like the sort of entry point into a discussion about labor that is broadly popular, you know, Kirk Douglas with his shirt off.
Nima: Tony Curtis.
Adam: Sorry, with all due respect to Tony Curtis. Talk about that, the sort of popularity of that narrative, again, it’s reduced to this kind of heroic narrative. But like, where did that, where was that oriented into this broader associations framework, and how people kind of mimic these structures, and what lessons can be drawn from that that are not this kind of cartoon, you know, Marcus Aurelius sitting here telling you how to, you know, how to eat shit and suck it up?
Sarah E. Bond: Well, I think Spartacus as a folk hero does not really gain a lot of steam until around the period of the French Revolution and a little bit before. So in terms of his revival, up until that point, people knew who Spartacus was, of course, he is written about by people like Appian and Plutarch, etc. That we have three Servile Wars. The first one is in Sicily in the end of the second century BCE, then we have another one that formulates out of Sicily a few years later. Spartacus himself is a few decades after that, and he’s not on Sicily. He is breaking out of a gladiatorial school in the area of Southern Italy, and Spartacus is seen by the contemporary sources and the sources that are not long thereafter as a rebel and a rabble-rouser. And of course, they’re not going on strike. They fully want freedom and never to come back to their jobs again. They do not want to return to being gladiators, so they’re not leveraging their labor in any way. They want to go free. And my belief is that they really should have, when they got towards the Alps, to continue going, but they circle back and they come back into the Italic peninsula, and I always want to yell like, Keep going, Spartacus! Keep going! But he’s not a hero in his own day. He may have been with enslaved persons. We don’t have a lot of their narratives or reactions to him, but during the period of the French Revolution, into later political campaigns in the 18th and then 19th and then 20th century, Spartacus gains more and more as a folk hero of freedom and rebellion against tyranny, whether it was in Prussia, where he was extremely popular. He became very popular in France and in the United States, and especially during the Haitian Revolution, where Toussaint Louverture takes the name of Black Spartacus. He’s given that name, but he is seen as, you know, this Haitian revolutionary leading enslaved persons to fight against enslavement within the island of Haiti, right? So all of these things build Spartacus’s hero worship, but the movie in 1960 really is what does it to the highest degree,
Adam: Written by a communist. No shocker there. Written by Dalton Trumbo.
Sarah E. Bond: Exactly. And it’s during the period of the blacklist. You know, they’re blacklisting communists after McCarthyism. That Spartacus is really about fighting against The Man. And I see Spartacus absolutely as the GOAT and a hero that should be celebrated. But we have to also remember that he was working within a gladiatorial troupe, and that gladiatorial troupe lives within the gladiatorial school, and they coordinate together. Spartacus has lieutenants that he works with, but he has a group of people that are very close to him that mobilize in a very planned rebellion in the gladiatorial school. They go to the kitchen, and they grab utensils and knives and break out of the gladiatorial school. And then, as they are moving through Italy, whether to Vesuvius, or whether going north, etc, they are gaining more and more enslaved persons in a very organized manner, up to about 100,000 people.
And this is during a period when Roman slavery had been growing so quickly. Over the past 200 years, Roman slavery had expanded to a level that that had never seen before, and the number of enslaved people was so high within the Italic peninsula. So, I mean, I think Spartacus deserves all of those kudos, but we also have to ask ourselves about other enslaved people into the period of the Empire, and part of that is looking at enslaved people that rebel against Rome, whether they’re mint workers, whether they’re charioteers, whether they’re bear trainers, that we never have a slave revolt that is to the level of Spartacus that we know of within the Roman Empire for the rest of its existence, there’s never a rebellion that is to the degree that Spartacus inspired and carried out, but that there are still enslaved people that went on strike and that engaged in joining collegia.
And so circling back to that first thesis that I was talking about, just because enslaved people exist within a society does not mean that there cannot be labor organization and that there cannot be people working together for a higher purpose, right? And so sometimes that purpose is manumission, and sometimes that purpose is to get higher wages. But just because they’re enslaved does not mean that they’re completely impotent or without any power within this labor economy.
Nima: Well, I think that is a perfect place to leave it. Sarah, this has been so wonderful, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on this Citations Needed livestream Beg-a-Thon. It has been truly wonderful to talk to you, Sarah. We have been speaking with Dr. Sarah E. Bond, Associate Professor in the Classics at the University of Iowa. You do have, like, a longer title: Erling B. “Jack” Holtsmark?
Sarah E. Bond: I’m an endowed chair in the history, I’m technically in the History Department with an appointment in Classics. I have a chair. It does not matter.
Nima: I feel like I need to read that title. It’s very prestigious.
Sarah E. Bond: It doesn’t, well, it doesn’t mean that much, except for, you know, that I feel very lucky to have the job that I do, that this is my job, that I get to do all day. So that’s good enough.
Nima: Yeah, that’s very Stoic of you.
Sarah E. Bond: I see what you did there. I see what you did there.
Adam: She’s the emperor, though. That’s objectively a great job.
Nima: Sarah, of course, is the author of the incredible new book. Adam and I both read it.
Adam: We actually read it. We didn’t fake-read it. We actually read it.
Nima: Man, is it fucking great. So please pick it up. The book is, of course, Strike: Labor, Unions, and Resistance in the Roman Empire, out now from Yale University Press. But Sarah, thank you so much for joining us today on Citations Needed. It has been amazing to have you.
Sarah E. Bond: Thank you for having me. Hopefully, I’ll see you again.
Nima: Indeed.

“Though you are a whole world, Rome, still, without love, the world’s not the world, and Rome cannot be Rome.” — Goethe
This book. I had this idea of traveling based on the books I was reading, and after nearly four years in Rome, I realized I had never read a book about the city itself. Perhaps I was too caught up in my daily struggles — and let me tell you, my life in Rome hasn’t been easy. Maybe my expectations were too high, or, as Goethe said, love was simply absent, and Rome wasn’t truly Rome to me. But this isn’t my story. Let’s get back to Anthony Doerr’s memoir.
As I write my humble thoughts on this memoir, I find myself flipping through its pages, revisiting the passages I underlined — the moments that touched my heart, the parts where I saw my own Roman story reflected. To be honest, Doerr’s first impressions of Rome mirrored how I felt after a year, maybe a year and a half, of living here.
I came to Rome for my master’s degree — my second one, actually — not just for academic reasons but as a way to escape Istanbul, to finally do something I had long felt was inevitable. I had always known my story wasn’t meant to unfold in just one city or country, though I had imagined it would be London, not Rome.
And yet, when I finally opened my eyes and truly started feeling Rome, it was exactly as Doerr described: noticing the endless sea of scooters, marveling at (or being horrified by) Italian driving, being simultaneously enchanted and frustrated by the city. In those early days, I was also angry — maybe disappointed — by what I had found here. And as I read through the beginning of Four Seasons in Rome, I could feel that same unease in Doerr’s words.
Throughout the pages, you experience what it’s like to be a parent to newborn twins — and, honestly, I’d much rather live that experience through his eyes than my own. But being in a foreign country doesn’t make it any easier. Even though our circumstances were different, there was one feeling we both shared: navigating this city while feeling lost — most of the time.
The missing piece, though, is love. I’m not sure if I should call myself fortunate, but in that regard, I’ve been quite lucky — if letting my heart get broken over and over counts as luck. I found real love here and lost it here. I cried here. I lost hope here. And yet, to truly experience Rome, love wasn’t necessary. As Doerr writes:
“And what about Rome? Rome is beautiful, Rome is ugly. Something about this city exacerbates contrast, the incongruities and contradictions…”
Rome has a way of filling that void in its own way, making sure you feel everything — whether you want to or not.
In the beginning, or let’s say during Fall, the book feels more factual, focused on adjustment. Doerr shares details about Rome, its quirks, its history. But as we move into Spring and Summer, we witness — or at least I felt — his gradual acceptance of the city, his growing appreciation for its beauty. And in these later chapters, the book shifts into something deeper. Not overwhelming, not philosophical, but it subtly invites the reader to take a step back, to ask certain questions, to reflect.
You should take note of the places Doerr mentions in this book — mostly around Monteverde, one of my favorite areas in Rome.
I’m not sure if anyone would be interested, so I won’t be sharing my full Roman guide, but I do want to give a shoutout to my favorite restaurants for the best carbonara. Why?
When I first moved to Rome, I was almost vegetarian — pescatarian, to be exact. While my friends indulged in legendary plates of pasta alla carbonara, I could only watch and wonder what all the fuss was about.
Then, for love, I started eating meat again. To be precise, I now eat guanciale, Italian cold cuts, poultry, and seafood — so really, there’s not much left off the menu, is there?
Naturally, my return to the eating-it-all era had to start with the famous carbonara. This passion quickly turned into a habit — I now order pasta alla carbonara every time I dine out. Here are some of my favorite spots to enjoy it:
I could go on forever — food is my passion, after all. But I suppose this article was meant to be about a book.
Okay, back to the book:
I’m so envious of Doerr for writing such a brilliantly pure, beautifully written book. No flashy marketing of la dolce vita — God knows I’m tired of the glossy image of Rome when the reality is far from dolce. He presents it all in a way that feels honest, and I couldn’t help but see parallels between the way Rome made him feel and the way I’ve felt since moving here.
I envy him even more because he came to Rome for a set period, with no trouble finding an apartment (thank you, Pope, honestly), which gave him the opportunity to experience the city without the complications that often come with living here. Or maybe the struggle is the true Roman experience. I’m not sure… Rome is my great dilemma and paradox.
Overall, I’m glad I don’t have to experience this city with newborn twins. I’m grateful for the daily challenges of living here and for the chance to experience life in its raw, unfiltered form. Rome is a beautiful city, though flawed in many ways. I can’t see myself growing old here — but that’s for purely professional reasons.
Finally, the author’s writing is captivating. Whether you live here or not, perhaps in another place, you’ll find yourself immersed in his story through his eyes. I absolutely loved this memoir, and it’s definitely a must-read. As he wrote:
“Roma, they say, non basta una vita. One life is not enough.”

When I tossed a small Italian lira coin into the Trevi fountain back in June 1987, it was to ensure my return to Rome someday, in accordance with the famous legend. On the cusp of turning 17, I had all the optimism in the world that I would indeed be back. And I was right. It just took a few decades. But lucky for me, Rome is known for being eternal and was waiting here for me.
A lot has changed since I was last here. My sunken coin is, of course, long gone. The lira isn’t even Italy’s currency anymore, having been replaced by the euro in 2002. Most importantly, I now have a greater appreciation of history than I did as a teenager. Back then, I just wanted to meet European boys, get served alcohol underage, and go out dancing with my friends. My pictures were mostly of our silly fun in hotel rooms or on the bus, and my more serious scenic ones came out dark, blurry, or had my finger in them.
This time around, I plan to mix sightseeing and trying to live like a local for a month, much like I did when I spent 30 days in Paris working remotely last summer. Exploring all of the Roman ruins there inspired me to head right to the source. My great-grandparents came to the United States from Italy, so I also want to soak in the Italian culture on a deeper level and make time for some quiet moments sitting in parks just observing people or while walking ancient roads like the old Appian Way.
I only had a few days to see the famous Roman sites that summer of ’87 so long ago. I was on a “Discovering Europe” group tour of around 50 people, mostly high school students and some parent-chaperones, which was arranged by my high school Spanish teacher. We had 24 days to see nine cities in four countries. Rome was a blur. I mainly remember our tour of the Colosseum, seeing where the Pope lives, and not liking the pizza.
I actually still have the travel journal I kept on that trip and dug it out of storage recently so that I could refresh my memory and maybe have a few laughs. It did not disappoint. Page after page of black cursive handwriting captured my deep teenage thoughts.
“I don’t like Rome at all. Our hotel room is right by a busy street. And just like in Paris people drive like maniacs beeping horns all the time.”
“Today sucked! We had to get up early to see the Palace of Versailles. It was a boring tour.”
“We went to a fast food place called Burger Quick. I only got a soda (6 francs) but the hamburgers I saw were gross! They were so rare!”
“In Venice we went on the most boringest walking tour ever! I was so tired I tried to sleep as I walked.”
I imagine my dusty travel journal being found a hundred years from now by my great-great-grandchildren in an attic somewhere. They would flip through the pages and marvel at the indecipherable writing. Thinking maybe it’s cuneiform or ancient Sanskrit, they take it to an antique dealer to see if it’s worth anything. Maybe even pay to have the cursive “translated” to see what profound insights were captured so painstakingly by hand. I imagine the translator gently revealing the contents to them.
“Well, she talks a lot about long bus rides, gross foreign food, and having to wake up too early for boring tours of churches and palaces. But, you know, things were hard back in the 20th century.”
I might not have had a big interest in art, culture, food, or history during that high school trip, but it did definitely awakened my curiosity about the world and gave me insight into how people in other countries lived. It even opened my mind to the world of politics a bit. In Italy, for example, I saw political graffiti, some of it anti-American, spray painted in English as our bus drove through the busy Roman streets. One night after dinner we strolled through St. Peter’s Square in Vatican City and came across a candle-holding procession of people. Our guide told us that they were protesting the Pope’s election of a man who was believed to be an ex Nazi war criminal. I filed these and other important learnings away in the back of my teenage brain since the highlight of that particular evening (according to my journal) was hanging out on the steps of a church near our hotel, listening to a portable radio and dancing around until our curfew came.
In my first Paris article, I talked about all of the funny mistakes I made on my first trips to Europe, such as washing my underwear and socks in a bidet in my Paris hotel room because I thought it was just another sink. Well, the faux pas streak continued a week later in Rome when I again used the sink to wash my shirts and shorts (a real one this time, not a bidet). I decided to hang them to dry over the railing of my partial balcony, which faced a busy Roman street. When I came back hours later, my clothes were hanging in various spots around the room, still wet. A chaperone soon told us that hanging clothes outdoors so close to the Vatican was forbidden and not to do it. My not-so-bright idea didn’t sit well with housekeeping, nor the papacy, apparently. Who knows though, I bet when no one’s looking, the Pope puts his big pointy hat on his window ledge every once in a while to air it out.
I grew up on the East Coast of the United States, so to me “old” was something that was built a few hundred years ago, not thousands like you see in Rome. My hometown of Bristol, Pennsylvania, was founded in 1681. That’s pretty old for a town in the United States, though it’s certainly not the oldest. For comparison, Philadelphia traces its roots back to 1682, New York City to 1624, and Boston to 1630. St. Augustine, Florida, has them all beat, though, having been continuously inhabited since 1565. Of course, if you head to the Southwest, you’ll find even older places that native Americans built.
One of my favorite places to eat in Bristol is the King George II Inn & Tavern, which is the oldest continuously operating inn in the country. I always thought it was cool that some of our founding fathers came through its doors, including a young George Washington, John Adams, and James Madison. Even France’s Marquis de Lafayette ate there, probably munching on an early variation of a burger and French fries (well, to him it would just be “fries,” I guess). That early fascination is probably why I tend to seek out pubs and restaurants that are considered “the oldest” in the cities I visit, and why I love to stay at historic hotels.
I remember the first time I encountered something much, much older and how it made my head spin with awe. I was working temporarily in London and took a day trip to Warwick Castle one weekend. At 23, I still wasn’t much into history, but since we did a lot of date memorizing in history classes, I remembered distinctly that in 1066 that famous William guy did his conquering thing and became King of England.
While walking around the grounds of the castle he had built, I became fixated on the dirt path I was following, imagining how he might have walked this same dusty path. I could literally be walking in William the Conqueror’s footsteps, I thought excitedly. History really came to life for me at that moment. If only teleportation were a thing, field trips for World History class would be way more interesting.
It’s even more amazing when something so old is still in use. Once when I was in Adana, Turkey, in the late ’90s, my husband and I were in a cab sitting in rush hour traffic and were amazed when the driver told us that the stone bridge we were stuck on was built by the Romans in the 2nd century. Imagine a structure surviving nearly 2,000 years intact possibly being taken down by a distracted driver on their cell phone or fumbling with the radio. I was happy to read years later that they banned cars on it in 2007, and now it’s open only to foot traffic.
The Romans sure knew how to build things to last. The Colosseum would be completely intact today if it wasn’t for earthquakes and people in the Middle Ages pillaging its stone blocks to use for other buildings. Then there’s the old Appian Way. I can’t wait to walk along what’s considered the oldest road in the world (that’s still visible). That expression — “All roads lead to Rome”? Well, this road is the mother of them all. It’s so old, some of the stones still have grooves in them from chariot wheels (and we think potholes are bad). I’m sure I’ll have a time-travel mind melt when I imagine myself walking in the footsteps of historical heavyweights such as Julius Caesar and Spartacus. Though not literally: Caesar’s feet probably never had to touch the ground, being a conquering dictator and all, and well, poor Spartacus was crucified on the old Appian Way along with thousands of other rebellious gladiators.
Starting in late May, I’ll be trying to live like a local while staying at an apartment in the Monteverde neighborhood, just south of Trastevere. It’s about an hour walk from my place to the Colosseum, so I definitely hope to be living away from the tourist crowds, especially since this is a Jubilee year for the Catholic Church, which happens only once every 25 years. There’s no metro stop on my side of the river, but there are buses, trams, and of course my two feet. I’ll need to get in as many steps as I can if I’m going to eat all of the things on my checklist.
I need to redeem my teenage self’s dislike of the one pizza experience I had in Rome, so there will be lots of pizza tasting of all shapes and sizes. I’m not really into meat toppings, so I’ll probably just do plain, but there are some interesting veggies to try on pizza like radicchio, zucchini flowers, and squash blossoms. And of course there’s the pasta. I learned that there are four classics I have to try in Rome: Gricia (ancient), Amatriciana, Carbonara, and Cacio e Pepe. I’m not sure if I’ll work up the courage to try the specialty dishes made with offal (intestines, stomach lining, etc.). Though I’m willing to try meatballs made with cow tail (oxtail) and the famous Saltimbocca alla Romana (veal). There’s also a fancy bologna-like lunchmeat called mortadella that looks interesting.
I’ll also of course make time to do some sightseeing when I’m not working. So much time has passed since my last visit to Rome there’s even been a new exciting discovery. In my teenage travel journal, I wrote that I had visited the Forum ruins where our tour guide Ned told us Julius Caesar was assassinated. But turns out that was wrong. Excavations in 2012 uncovered markings by Caesar’s successor Augustus where he designated the exact spot. Turns out, it happened in the Curia di Pompey, a meeting place within the Pompey Theater complex that the Senators were using while the Senate House was being renovated. In 2023 a raised walkway was built over the excavation site so that visitors could get a closer look.
I’m sure I’ll have many moments where I try to imagine myself living among the ancient Romans. Like Russell Crowe’s character Maximus did in the Gladiator movie, I like to run my hands along tall grasses and plant leaves within my reach. It’s something I do no matter where I am walking, but in a place with lots of history, it helps me to feel connected to the people who were there centuries before me. It’s the same with touching walls, trees, and stones (when it’s allowed). Though my hands won’t be going anywhere near the stone latrine seats of the ancient communal bathrooms that I hope to see when touring the nearby ruins of Ostia Antica. I don’t need to imagine that part of ancient Roman life.
I am, however, open to the idea of using a bidet. In a kind of weird, come-full-circle plot twist, the apartment I’m renting has a bathroom with a bidet right next to the toilet. The place does have a washer and dryer, so don’t worry — my underwear and socks will be properly laundered this time.
Eventually, I plan to document here on Medium how it all went. Until then, follow my stories and posts on Instagram (@pammypez).

In the annals of Roman history, certain names echo with legendary resonance: Caesar, Augustus, Nero. Yet, there are emperors whose legacies, though significant, shimmer less vividly in the collective memory. Among these, Lucius Verus (130–169 AD) stands as a compelling figure, whose reign alongside Marcus Aurelius marked a period of both prosperity and profound challenges for the Roman Empire.
The Path to Power
Lucius Verus’ path to the imperial throne was both unique and a reflection of the complex adoption practices among Roman elites. Born Lucius Ceionius Commodus, his rise to prominence came through a series of strategic adoptions orchestrated by Hadrian to ensure a smooth succession. Hadrian first adopted Antoninus Pius on the condition that Antoninus would subsequently adopt both Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Ceionius Commodus (the future Lucius Verus). This series of adoptions was aimed at securing a stable and capable line of succession.
Upon Hadrian’s death, Antoninus Pius became emperor, and Lucius Verus, alongside Marcus Aurelius, was groomed for future leadership. The true moment of Lucius Verus’ accession began when Antoninus Pius died in 161 AD. In a historic move, Marcus Aurelius, immediately upon becoming emperor, insisted on sharing power with Lucius Verus, thereby elevating him to the status of co-emperor. This decision was groundbreaking, marking the first time in Roman history that the empire was officially ruled by two emperors simultaneously. The co-emperorship was a testament to their close relationship and Marcus Aurelius’ desire for a balanced and shared rule.
Military Endeavors
Lucius Verus’ reign was significantly shaped by his military campaigns, particularly in the East. The Parthian War (161–166 AD) stands out as the most notable. Initially, Verus was criticized for his seemingly luxurious lifestyle in Antioch, away from the front lines. However, under his nominal command, Roman forces, led by capable generals such as Avidius Cassius, achieved significant victories, including the capture of the Parthian capital, Ctesiphon, in 165 AD. These successes expanded Roman influence in the East and brought substantial booty back to Rome, but they also inadvertently introduced a devastating plague that would afflict the empire for years.
Coinage and Public Image
The coinage of Lucius Verus, like that of many Roman emperors, served as a vital tool for propaganda and the projection of imperial authority. His coins frequently depicted themes of victory and divine favor, reinforcing his and Marcus Aurelius’ status as protectors and benefactors of the empire. The imagery on these coins, ranging from representations of conquered territories to symbols of military success, played a crucial role in shaping public perception of his reign.
Architectural Contributions and Public Works
Although Lucius Verus’ rule is less noted for monumental architecture than that of his co-emperor Marcus Aurelius, his contributions to Rome’s urban landscape were not insignificant. He and Marcus Aurelius jointly dedicated the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, transforming a personal monument into a public space of worship. Additionally, the triumphal arches and other structures erected in their honor celebrated their military victories and served as enduring symbols of their joint rule.
Personal Life and Legacy
Verus’ personal life, marked by his marriage to Marcus Aurelius’ daughter Lucilla, was integral to the political and familial alliances that underpinned the stability of their co-emperorship. His untimely death in 169 AD, possibly due to the plague that followed the Parthian campaign, brought an end to this unique period of dual rule. In the aftermath, Marcus Aurelius continued to govern alone, facing further military and social challenges without the partnership that had characterized their approach to leadership.
Lucius Verus’ reign, though overshadowed by that of his more philosophically inclined co-emperor, was a pivotal period in the history of the Roman Empire. His military successes bolstered Rome’s territorial and strategic standing, while his coinage and public works projects contributed to the civic and cultural life of the empire. Despite the brevity of his rule and the challenges that marred it, Verus’ legacy is a testament to the complexities and contradictions of imperial leadership in ancient Rome.
Conclusion
Lucius Verus, often overlooked in the shadow of Marcus Aurelius, was a figure of considerable importance in the Roman imperial pantheon. His unique position as co-emperor, his military accomplishments, and his role in the cultural and economic life of the empire offer valuable insights into the dynamics of Roman imperial rule and the challenges it faced. As we reflect on his legacy, we are reminded of the myriad ways in which power, politics, and personal ambition intersect in the annals of history, shaping the destinies of empires and their rulers.

Since the election in America, I have had to take a few somewhat drastic steps to maintain my sanity, and they began with divorcing myself from any and all news, primarily anything related to politics. Someone else I know called it Ostrich Mode, but I prefer to think of it as Turtle Mode. A complete withdrawal from most of society. Knowing how impulsive I can sometimes be, it’s hard to believe this will be a long-term thing, but you never know.
Therefore, out of fairness to all our writers, I am suspending the acceptance of any new writing at this time. I don’t want to ignore those trying to publish and I realize I risk permanently losing both readers and writers, but my only alternative is to either ignore the publication altogether, or delete it. I would prefer not deleting it at this time. The publication will remain live. I just won’t be accepting any new stories for the time being. I thank you for your understanding, and good luck.
If and when I regain some equilibrium, I’ll let you know and we’ll get back to business.

Bam, here we are, back in his apartment close to Altitude 100, where the chicken drawing has been set straight. The place is clean, relatively orderly now and C. is cooking a gourmet dinner for us. He is French, you can’t teach much more to a French guy who knows how to cook. You mostly sit down and enjoy the food he is making and the show of him making it. The ingredients come out of brown paper wrappings, not from plastic bags. The man loves to show his skill. Nevertheless, he burns a couple of the dishes, possibly stage fright? That’s OK, I think I’m getting used to his way of self-sabotaging his best intentions. So we sit down and eat some very sophisticated, yet burned entrées, under the modernistic chicken gaze.
There is no male gaze anywhere that I can see here, but there is this chicken looking down on us. This brings an offbeat touch to things. I feel safe with him, he is generous and open. His engaged leftism makes me look centrist at best, in many topics and it makes me reconsider some of my positions. He is softly teasing me about working for a big nasty corporation, in marketing of all things. While he is the gauchist journalist investigating big…

Every successful school of thought, religion and system that has endured the test of time has one common precept: When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
It means that if your idea is universal enough to offer food for thought and even some enlightening properties, your approach must be adaptable to changing circumstances, cultures and norms. But with one catch: the core teaching must remain universal and comprehensive — intact.
The saying I quoted earlier comes from the 4th century Bishop of Milan, St Ambrose. He was a theologian and statesman with solid leadership, profoundly shaping early Christian theology and doctrine.
Ambrose was what we call an inspirational speaker. He could wow the audience but didn’t let popularity blur his views. He didn’t let anything dilute his faith and was fierce against heresy. The saying attributed to him tells us about a person who is pragmatic yet has strong integrity.

Migrants poured over the southern border. Many came for jobs after employment options in their home regions had dried up; others were attracted to the excitement and glamour of their destination. Soon the influx began to worry leading politicians, who authorized a series of enforcement actions against select categories of immigrants. Deportations, they believed, would put an end to the mess. No luck: undeterred, the immigrants kept coming.
At last, one politician ventured a proposal. Why not extend the citizenship? Not to all non-citizens, of course — just to one specific, carefully circumscribed subset. But one party was having none of it: “if you give them citizenship,” the party’s spokesman insisted, “you assume (I think) that you’ll still have the same political rights and worship in the same way as you do now. But don’t you realize that those people will take over everything?” The proposal withered on the vine.
The speaker of these lines was Gaius Fannius, consul in 122 BCE and a dogged opponent of Gaius Gracchus’ proposal to extend the citizenship to Rome’s Latin allies. For all its celebrated inclusivity, ancient Rome had residents and leaders who were none too pleased about the continuous stream of immigrants: Fannius’ warning is a distant echo of Donald Trump’s “we either have a country or we don’t have a country.” Romans were as willing as many Americans are today to give this displeasure political and legal expression.
But why undertake this rewriting of late republican Rome in the first place? Partly because in doing so I join a modern conversation about immigration that — in both Europe and America — regularly and explicitly adduces parallels from the ancient world as justification for various kinds of immigration policy. In this article, I’ll examine the sentimental and rhetorical configurations through which ancient Rome (and Greece) are put to work in contemporary discussions of immigration and outline how Romans themselves perceived and responded to immigration during the Republic and Empire. In a second, follow-up article, I’ll explore how mobility in the ancient Mediterranean structurally mirrored 21st-century migration towards Europe and the United States. Ancient history can clarify how we think about recent developments, just not in the way(s) normally assumed.
Let me stress that my own perspective as a formerly undocumented immigrant with emphatically pro-migrant political commitments informs what and how I write. No Tacitean disavowal of bias for me. But I hope that even those who do not share my views on immigration will consider how antiquity can be repurposed in modern conversations about immigration.
Writing in the pages of The Wall Street Journal, Cambridge classicist Mary Beard recently asserted that the Romans “would have been puzzled by today’s hostility to migrants.” Well before the publication of the op-ed, Beard made use of her status as one of Britain’s foremost public intellectuals to offer a liberal perspective — sometimes greeted with viciously misogynistic hostility — on contemporary migrant and refugee matters.
The tradition of roping the ancient world into assessments of modern immigration has been a fixture of British political and cultural discourses for quite some time: Enoch Powell’s infamous 1968 “Rivers of Blood” speech (complete with Vergilian allusion) standing at one end of the political spectrum, with Boris Johnson’s 2006 Dream of Rome closer to the other. As Mayor of London, Johnson has continued beating the classical drum, issuing warnings that Britain will turn into the ancient state least like Rome in its treatment of foreigners — Sparta — should it adhere to plans to reduce its net migration.
On the other side of the Atlantic, another professional classicist has intervened in the immigration debates: Victor Davis Hanson. Not one to be deterred by the prospect of controversy, Hanson waded into the immigration-policy waters with his 2003 hybrid-genre book Mexifornia. After first observing that “America is what Rome once was to hustling Jews, Greeks and Numidians” (p. 51), Hanson goes on to claim in his epilogue that the “freedom and material dynamism of the West are drawing millions to its shores — in the manner that Athens once attracted metics from Asia, and Rome drew Africans, Jews and Armenians” (p. 142). (And as proof that classicists holding forth on immigration can irritate members of the political establishment, one need look no further than Hanson: after introducing himself as a “classicist” at a Capitol Hill briefing the year of his book’s publication, Hanson was reportedly accosted by a Congressional staffer who thought he had heard Hanson term himself a “classist”; the face-off ended with the staffer exiting the briefing in anger.)
Comparisons of modern America to ancient Rome are, of course, nothing new, and so hackneyed by now as to inspire a book-length rebuttal. But in recent decades many of these comparisons have been fueled by anxieties about immigration, particularly of the illegal/undocumented variety. Actress and conservative politician Clare Boothe Luce expressed concern in a 1982 Washington Post interview that the United States might be headed “for the fate of ancient Rome … a city of pollution and noise and foreigners, [that] collapsed under the weight of the barbarians.”
Since 9/11, the argument that a lax immigration policy will hasten the United States’ Rome-like demise has steadily gained traction. A 2004 Florida Times-Union editorial on “illegal immigration and the problems that go with it” ended on this ominous note: “ancient Rome couldn’t, or wouldn’t, stop the influx of barbarians across its border.” Taking to The Washington Post in 2007 to outline a “tolerant but also tough” vision for US immigration policy, Yale Law School professor Amy Chua reminded her readers that the “greatest empire in history, ancient Rome, collapsed when its cultural and political glue dissolved … [i]n part, this fragmentation occurred because of a massive influx of immigrants from a very different culture.” Three years later, Stevens Institute of Technology professor Silvio Laccetti argued that Rome’s extension of its citizenship through the Edict of Caracalla had precipitated an “erosion of civic pride and responsibility” in the course of outlining his own proposal of a tolerant but tough immigration scheme. And in undoubtedly the most entertaining riff on the Rome conceit, Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) went full Cicero on the Senate floor — framing Obama as Catiline — following the President’s November 2014 announcement of an executive order deferring the deportation of undocumented parents of American citizens and permanent residents.
You wouldn’t be wrong to suspect that the genealogy I’ve charted so far has an even deeper history: the practice of invoking the Roman Republic and Empire’s treatment of immigrants as paradigmatic and/or cautionary is already on display in the state- and nation-building discourses of the early modern period. Edward Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire reserves the purplest of its purple prose for the barbarians at the gate and the Fifth Column of immigrant slaves and domestics waiting to welcome them. (Last year, a lengthy rumination — sprinkled with block quotations from Decline and Fall — on Gibbon’s continuing relevance was posted to breitbart.com under the pseudonym “Virgil” and triggered over 1400 comments, mostly effusions of agreement.) Before Gibbon, Montesquieu had sketched the contribution of foreigners and barbarians to Rome’s imperial dissolution in chapter 16 of his Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline.
But well before either, Machiavelli had taken a somewhat different line on immigration in Discourses on Livy, praising Rome’s openness to foreigners as integral to the amassing of the military and economic power through which the republic set itself apart from Athens and Sparta (II.3). Machiavelli wasn’t just anticipating Boris Johnson’s evaluation of Roman greatness as a consequence of open migration. Diligent reader of Livy that he was, Machiavelli was putting his finger on a line of argument that reached back to the ancients themselves.
The history of rhetorically positioning Rome’s treatment of immigrants really begins in antiquity, with both Greeks and Romans chiming in on the fluctuating — and at times very divergent — trends in the Republic and Empire’s openness. Having worked our way backwards in time to the ancients, we should now pause and ask: how open were Romans to foreigners, really? It turns out that Romans were far more ambivalent about immigration than some moderns give them credit for.
In the first decade of the war with Hannibal, a Macedonian king turned Roman adversary praised the Republic’s free and easy bestowal of citizenship in a letter exchange with a Greek city-state. In a world where city-states could be quite stingy with grants of citizenship — especially Sparta, notorious for its deportations — Rome had so succeeded in marketing itself as exceptional that even an enemy felt compelled to take notice. This marketing took several forms, and the one that has left the most durable imprint on literary and non-literary sources alike is Rome’s origin myth.
In contrast to the Greek city-states whose origin stories indulged the fantasy of autochthony (according to which a community and its members sprang up from the earth in the place they inhabited), Rome promoted itself as the product of immigrants. Molded during the turbulent centuries of Italian and Mediterranean expansion, Rome’s legendary history began with an illegal immigrant: pious Aeneas, fleeing with his family and friends from the devastation of Troy household gods in hand, elderly father on his back, young son by his side.
As canonized in the Aeneid, the challenges faced by the founder of the Roman race include some of the traditional (epic) dilemmas of travel — where to go and how long to stay, whose hospitality to accept and whose to decline — Homeric effects translated for a Roman audience. And once Aeneas and his band do arrive on Italian shores, they are denied the happily-ever-after outcome. Their lot is to contend with belligerence, grief, early death.
Some months ago, Michael Fontaine proposed in this publication a reading of the Aeneid’s second half that aligns rather felicitously with contemporary geopolitical events. On one level, the Aeneas myth internalizes the plight of immigrants/refugees (fato profugi); at the same time, it gives form to the mirror anxiety of those native residents who from the first encounter feel that the new arrivals will take their land and resources and women.
Spinning out this thread further, I’d add that the ambivalence towards refugees and immigrants woven into the Aeneas legend reflects centuries of unease at Rome about the presence and role of foreigners. The unease was embodied in the mythic personas of Aeneas, Romulus, and Remus, all three of whom were remembered as thieves, rapists, and murderers. Here comparison with the modern myth of the immigrant as criminal is instructive. Earlier this year, to thumps and cheers, Trump laid out his campaign platform on immigration:
“The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems…When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best…They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us [sic]. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”
Trump and his partisans seem to have a complementary myth at hand: the “Ellis Island” arrivals of virtuous character and exemplary work ethic (unlike today’s purveyors of drugs and crime). Much the same conflict between these two alternate ideals of the immigrant played out in ancient Rome. As Rome expanded, nativist and xenophobic discourses proliferated, with consequences for the waves of immigrants settling down in Rome in the last centuries of the Republic and first few centuries of the Empire.
These discourses had sharp legal teeth. On top of the targeted removals and expulsions of groups identified as religiously and/or philosophical suspect — the Bacchants in 186 BCE, philosophers in 161 and 154, Chaldaeans and Jews in 139 — immigrants hailing from communities elsewhere in Italy were deported on multiple occasions in the years 187–172 (citations and discussion: Noy, Foreigners at Rome, pp. 37–47). Sometime in the 120s, a law was passed expelling all foreigners from the city of Rome; another version of the law was passed in 65 BCE. Thanks to the Severan-era historian Cassius Dio, we know something of the reasons for the second law’s passage (37.9): not only were foreigners believed to be too numerous, it was worried that they weren’t suitable enough (epitedeioi) to live alongside Romans.
It’s worth remembering that throughout this entire time Rome still had a republican system of government. These laws were ratified by popular will and not autocratic imposition. Since foreigners couldn’t necessarily be identified on sight (any romano di Roma stood a decent chance of being physically indistinguishable from an immigrant), it is anyone’s guess how these laws were enforced. The association of specific neighborhoods with certain groups of immigrants may have played a role in the orchestration of round-ups.
We do know that one Roman witness to the law of 65 did not like what he saw. Characterizing this law and its predecessor from the 120s as designed not only to deny foreigners access to Rome but to deport those already living there (eosque exterminant), Cicero declares in the De officiis that “denying foreigners access to our city is patently inhumane” (3.11.47). Although he managed to successfully defend the poet Aulus Licinius Archias from deportation, Cicero laments in a letter to his friend Atticus that the same law had been deployed, out of spite, to condemn (and presumably deport) a freedman assistant to the politician and former consul Aulus Gabinius after Gabinius beat charges of political corruption.
Neither the moral nor rhetorical authority of Cicero could halt the policing and deportation of certain categories of immigrants; the practice persisted well into the Empire. Yet immigrants kept on coming. The satirist Juvenal’s bombastic xenophobe Umbricius couldn’t abide their presence: “Romans, I can’t tolerate the city being Greek. Yet what portion of the shit is really Greek? For a long time now the Syrian Orontes has poured into the Tiber…” (Sat. 3.58–60). But for the Greek-speaking author of The Learned Banqueters, it was precisely Rome’s embrace of different immigrant populations that enhanced its glory: it was a heavenly city, encompassing so many foreign populations as to defy enumeration (Deipn. 1.20b-c).
We should be careful to respect the differences between ancient Rome and the modern US (or Europe). For example, the preoccupation with “border enforcement” wasn’t quite as intense among the Romans — though perhaps the time has come to read Augustus’ reported advice to Tiberius to “keep the empire’s borders secure” (my consciously tendentious rendering of Tacitus’ enigmatic coercendi intra terminos imperii) and/or Aelius Aristides’ praise of the Empire’s walls in his Roman Oration as implicated in a kind of border politics. And at no point in its trajectory from Republic or Empire was Rome a nation in the modern sense.
But with these caveats out of the way, I want to underline a few fundamental similarities between the immigration sensibilities of ancient Rome and those of 21st-century America. Then as now, foundation myths about the state as the creation of immigrants articulated and projected deeply felt anxieties about the legacy of past immigrants and the presence of current ones. Then as now, some of those anxieties were worked out through legal-administrative means, with deportation privileged as a technology of control. Then as now, foreigners stood to lose the most in confrontations between political elites — think back to Gabinius’ freedman. Then as now, the immigrant influx could inspire despair over the country going to rot or euphoria at its cosmopolitan inclusivity. Then as now, immigrants were vulnerable to hate crimes.
Hate crimes, you say?
Earlier this year, “Death to Islam” was spray-painted on the wall of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Heritage Association center in Spokane, Washington. Thousands of hate crimes are reported in the United States each year. These figures — dismayingly consistent from year to year — probably underrepresent the true number of hate crimes perpetrated. Setting aside for now the reliability of the FBI statistics, I want to concentrate on the graffito as medium for xenophobia. Even for the spray-painter, there is ancient precedent.
At some point during the second century CE, a tombstone was set up in Rome under the supervision of a certain Charitonius Mercurius for a deceased cavalry officer. From the tombstone we learn that the officer — whose name is not preserved in what remains of the inscription — was of Arabian extraction (natione Arabus); he’d lived to the age of 35, soldiering for 16 of those years and attaining the rank of eques singularis along the way. Many examples of this type of inscription survive, but in this case the real kicker comes in the form of a Greek graffito left behind by someone, possibly a fellow cavalry officer, that reads: Θ. Ἄραπσι (“Death to the Arabs!”).
The cultural and linguistic complexities of xenophobic resentment in Imperial Rome were such that a Greek-speaking resident of Rome could scrawl an ethnic taunt on a monument to a Latin-speaking native of the Near East. Romans were quite skilled at the use of graffiti to mock the immigrant Other: the late second/early third-century CE graffito from the Palatine featuring a donkey on a crucifix and the tag (again in Greek) “Alexamenos worships God” may be the earliest example of such visual denigration being applied to Greek-speaking Christians residing in Rome — and takes us back to the anxiety voiced by Gaius Fannius that immigrants would menace religious practices at home.
But my interest in summoning up the ghost of the graffito artist who marked up the tombstone has to do with the fantasy of violence folded into the tag. The cavalry officer was already dead, else he might have had a thing or two to say to the violator of his memorial. Alive and far more vulnerable was the homeless Mexican man recently beaten by two Boston men, one of whom claimed as his inspiration Donald Trump’s call to deport the undocumented.
Trump’s rhetoric justifies the commission of acts of violence against immigrants by characterizing them as inherently violent. On the stump, he has bemoaned the scourge of rapists, murderers and thieves originating not only in Mexico but “coming from all over South and Latin America and … coming probably, probably, from the Middle East.” It doesn’t seem to register among his fans that the “problem” of immigrant crime is a fiction: multiple studies carried out over the past century have repeatedly confirmed that immigrants commit crime at lower rates than the general population. What does register is the fear-mongering, especially among those already inclined to believe that white Americans are endangered: in July a petition was posted to WhiteHouse.gov asking President Obama to honor Trump “for opposing white genocide.”
Once the immigrant is construed as an existential threat, xenophobic sentiment rallies around the idea of removing that threat by any and all means necessary. Both in ancient Rome and in modern America, the fear of immigrants activates not only the desire to remove their bodies from sight through deportation, but to deprive them of life — to destroy them.

December 1, 2024First Sunday of Advent, Year CSt. Stephen’s UMC, Burke, VARomans 8:18–25 (NRSVUE)**A Sermon Series on Fuquay’s The Way to Bethlehem
For this season of Advent — a time of anticipation and preparation for the coming Christ — we will base our sermon series on Rob Fuquay’s book titled On the Way to Bethlehem: An Advent Study.
Throughout this series, we will visit four key places, starting with Rome, then moving to Jerusalem and Nazareth, and finally arriving in Bethlehem. My prayer is that as we embark on this journey together, the Spirit will guide us closer to the humble manger in Bethlehem, where we encounter Love Incarnate — God-with-us — the one named Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, and Prince of Peace.
You may wonder why we start with Rome. All the other locations seem straightforward. The Gospel of Luke begins in Jerusalem, where the angel announced Elizabeth’s pregnancy to Zechariah who was serving in the temple. Then it moves to Nazareth, where the same angel announced the pregnancy news to Elizabeth’s much younger cousin, Mary. Afterward, Mary and Joseph had to travel to Bethlehem, where Jesus was ultimately born.
So, why does this Advent journey start in Ancient Rome?
Just like how people consider Washington D.C. as a focal point of America’s power and influence, Rome symbolizes the power and influence that makes up its empire which stretched vastly across Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, including the regions of Judea where much of the New Testament narrative takes place.
This Roman Empire is often regarded as one of the most successful civilizations in human history. During the period of the Pax Romana, which means “Roman Peace” in Latin, the empire experienced centralized governance, economic prosperity, cultural flourishing, and relative stability — all the things we, humans, across time, hope for in their governments.
A key factor contributing to the period of the Pax Romana was the infrastructure developed under the reign of Caesar Augustus. During his forty-year rule, Augustus oversaw the construction of approximately fifty thousand miles of highways, creating an extensive network of roads that facilitated travel and communication. This network boosted trade, streamlined administration, and enabled the spread of ideas across the empire. Additionally, these roads allowed Roman legions to move swiftly, ensuring rapid responses to uprisings and external threats, thereby solidifying Rome’s control over its vast and diverse territories.
While the Pax Romana brought unprecedented peace and prosperity to Roman citizens, it came at a steep cost for many, particularly noncitizens and marginalized groups. High taxes were levied to sustain Rome’s massive military and ambitious infrastructure projects, disproportionately burdening conquered peoples and lower classes. Enslavement was widespread, with millions of individuals from conquered territories forced into servitude to fuel the empire’s economy and labor needs. Noncitizens lacked the legal protections and privileges of Roman citizens and were frequently exploited or oppressed under imperial rule. For many, the Pax Romana was not a time of peace but one of subjugation, inequality, and suffering under the heavy hand of empire.
Mary and Joseph were among those living under Roman occupation as Jews, part of the conquered peoples and noncitizens of the empire. And their journey to Bethlehem was not one of choice but of obligation, prompted by a decree from Caesar Augustus, calling for a census. And this census was a common tool of an empire, often used to increase tax revenues to support its vast ambitions.
So, imagine how these conquered people, including Mary and Joseph, felt as they trudged toward Bethlehem. There might have been a sense of helplessness as they complied with orders, knowing they had no choice. Perhaps there was skepticism and fear, wondering what new demands or hardships might further complicate their already difficult lives. Perhaps they felt resignation and complacency, accepting their reality that the only way to survive was to serve the empire without resistance. Or maybe they felt the weight of defeat and hopelessness, quietly echoing the psalmist’s cry: “How long, O Lord?” (Psalm 13).
Although we are no conquered people, perhaps we can relate to them in some way — especially to the feeling of helplessness before the forces that shape our lives. On a systemic level, we recognize policies and systems beyond our control that bring harm, prioritize profit over people, and perpetuate inequality or suffering, impacting countless lives, especially those who are marginalized and voiceless. On a personal level, we acknowledge forces that harm us and leave us feeling defeated, despite our deep longing for change — whether it be chronic illness, long-term addiction, destructive habits, abusive relationships, or loneliness. Scripture calls these forces, which operate on personal, systemic, and cosmic levels, “principalities and powers” (Eph 6:12). These forces can feel like chains of bondage and captivity, leaving us yearning for liberation and longing for a hope that can break through and set us free. This is the very starting point of our journey: Rome represents the seat of these principalities and powers, a place where “our hopes and fears are released and sometimes collide.” Thus, Advent begins with longing — longing for change, longing for freedom, longing for justice, longing for peace, longing for deliverance, longing for salvation, longing for the Savior.
Out of Israel’s longing for a Savior, Jesus Christ was born.
But that is only half of the Advent story.
The other half of the story is
that out of our longing for a Savior, Jesus Christ will come again.
Isn’t that the mystery of faith we proclaim?
Christ has died; Christ is risen; Christ will come again.
So, let me ask you:
The Apostle Paul speaks to our experience of longing in today’s scripture, written to the house churches in Rome who were expecting Jesus’ return within their lifetime. Their waiting for the coming of Christ met with the harsh reality of suffering. As you know, they were the church in Rome, the very seat of principalities and powers. Once again, in the midst of suffering, they longed for change, redemption, and restoration; they groaned for their Savior.
Paul writes to their experience, emphasizing that it is not just they but the whole creation that groans together for salvation, as if enduring the pains of labor. In other words, their shared suffering is not the end — it is a hopeful anticipation of new birth and new life. Although all they could see and feel now is indescribable pain, Paul encourages them to wait in eager longing and hope, for a wonderful gift of future glory is on the way.
And this expectant groaning of labor pains still applies to us today. We continue to wait in hopeful anticipation for new birth and new life, even in the face of the present sufferings in our world, which we experience and for which we intercede. And we remain hopeful because of the first fruits of the Spirit: the glimpses of God’s kingdom, the moments when the Holy Spirit moves among us, and the gifts of grace we witness every day through Christ. In other words, we remain hopeful because our God intercedes for us in our collective suffering.
Consider the glimpses of God’s kingdom, the moments when the Holy Spirit has moved among us, or the gifts of grace we have witnessed. These phrases often describe experiences that exceed our expectations and understandings. These capture divine surprises that defy our skepticism and cynicism. These embody the extraordinary love we receive from those who reflect Christ. These first-fruit experiences are what keep us hopeful in our suffering. And our state of hopefulness in labor pain produces in us not only trust and firmness in the faith, but also a different way of living. Through our words and actions, we reveal an alternative way of being in the world through sharing the gifts of the Spirit with those around us.
Again, I find Paul’s metaphor of labor pain brilliant. I remember being in a delivery room for almost twenty-four hours, being next to my wife as she endured intense pain and extreme fatigue. And we were there pushing for this baby to come out in hopeful anticipation, without any idea of what this baby would become, what gifts she would bring to our family, or how her presence would alter our lives.
As Paul writes in today’s scripture, hope that is seen is not hope, but we hope for what we do not see. And we do so with endurance, steadfastness, and perseverance — which are what the translated word patience tries to convey. I think this is both the most beautiful and frustrating part of our Christian journey: we do not hope for what is seen but for what we do not see. Our hope lies not in absolute certainty but in humble mystery. Our hope flourishes not in human preference but in divine imagination.
This is the very movement of our faith journey, revealed through the story of Advent. Out of Israel’s longing for a Savior, Jesus Christ was born in the most unexpected way possible — in a lowly manger as a helpless baby. Out of Creation’s longing for a Savior, Jesus brought salvation to us in the most unexpected way possible — through death on a cross and resurrection. Out of our longing for a Savior, Jesus has and will continue to reveal himself to us in unexpected ways. And out of the whole Creation’s longing for a Savior, we believe Jesus Christ will come again in the most unexpected way possible.
Dear church, let me ask you these questions once again:
Whenever we think about these things, we often wish — perhaps most of the time — that God would just act like a human empire, issuing decrees to put a swift end to our misery and all human sufferings. We wish God would just tell us imperatively what to do so we no longer have to deal with all these problems.
But, as the book On the Way to Bethlehem beautifully describes,¹
God does not decree. Rater, God births. God sends a baby, a Son. A Son who would be killed by the empire under which he was born, suffering a Roman crucifixion. Why? So that something new could be birthed in our hearts. Whatever change needs to happen in our world begins with our being born again. For what does creation wait for with eager longing? “For the revealing of the children of God.” [That’s] us, born again.
Despite how much we might wish the church could operate like an empire, the church is called to be more like a harvest field — patiently spreading the seeds of God’s kingdom in all soils, with hope that those seeds will sprout and grow in our hearts. Only then can we be born again, yielding a harvest of fruits to be shared with the world.
As we begin this Advent season, I pray that seeds of divine imagination take root in our hearts. May the story of Christmas be more than an occasion to revisit an old tale. May it become an invitation to leave behind our “Rome” with hopeful anticipation. As we draw closer to O little town of Bethlehem, may Christ be born anew in our hearts, and may we, too, be renewed and born again in Christ.
In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

What to read before your Italian adventure!
There can’t be a definitive list of books to read before going travelling to a glorious new destination, but I tried to find and read as many recommendations as I could before my trip to Florence and Rome, and here are the books that I found most enjoyable and interesting.
My top choice funnily enough, was from a series of books called Horrible Histories that I read when I was younger, and found that it had the most comprehensive whistle-stop tour of ancient Rome presented in an entertaining manner for a busy but curious traveller.
The Ruthless Romans is full of jokes, anecdotes, and important historical figures. It covers Ancient Rome from 1000 BC - 476 AD and is shockingly dense and informative for such an easy read. If you don’t have any time at all, try reading this on the plane to da Vinci airport.
Between the collapse of the Republic and start of the Roman Empire is a key piece that I read in high school: Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare. I don’t think you need to read Shakespeare before a trip, but if you like me have fond memories of sitting in class mesmerized by a political conflict written four centuries ago about a historical event from a couple of millennia ago, then you’ll remember the irony that in killing Caesar for his assumed monarchic intent, the Senate all but ensured that “another Caesar” would eventually take over Rome as its first emperor: Augustus.
To go off on another minor nostalgic tangent, if Shakespeare is too much of a commitment before a trip to Rome, Asterix hilariously covers the Roman campaigns that lead to the events in Julius Caesar.
For some real, serious history, these two were the most recommended:
Unfortunately I only managed to dip my toes in them before my trip and they were very dense and informative.
On a lighter note, I did breeze through Angels and Demons. It was an action-packed thriller that plays fast and loose with facts.
I liked that it covered Vatican City, which none of the previous books do, and touched on the works of Botticelli and Dante, who were both all over especially Florence and Rome.
For Florence, I’ve been reading The Enchantress of Florence that does an incredible job setting the stage for what the world was like in the 16th century and how interconnected Italy, Turkey, India and everything in between were by trade links and travellers.
Some other books by Italian authors and set in Italy that I didn’t have a chance to read but would like to in the future are:
And to throw it in there because it was everywhere, especially in Florence where Dante’s bones aren’t: The Divine Comedy.

The plan was to end the day at the Villa Borghese gardens, but with twenty more minutes of walking and legs already exhausted from a full day on foot, it didn’t seem worth it.
Instead, I stopped on a pedestrian terrace along the busy Via Frattina, not far from my hotel.
A glass of red wine, a seat outside, and a bit of people-watching paired with a book. It’s a great exercise to avoid reaching for your phone when you’re sitting alone.
The café held me for about half an hour, soaking in the buzz of the street and the taste of the wine.
Once the last sip of Italian red was gone, I headed back to the Bulgari hotel to get my power bank. Yes, I was staying at the Bulgari hotel, and no, I can’t afford it. That’s a story for another time.
As I approach the reception, five people in uniform turn to face me.
I ask if I can grab something from my bags, which were stored in the luggage room, and a beautiful young man smiles at me, “Of course. Follow me.”
We walk into the room, and he leads me to my things.
“Oh, so you don’t need this. You know which ones they are.” I say quietly, as I glance down…

Non-members of Medium can read the full article here.
I first visited Rome with my family a few years back. We were planning to do the main touristy things, but when faced with the endless queue in St Peter’s Square, we had a change of plan and a wander down to the river instead.
I’d not done much research for the trip, unusual for me, but I wasn’t organising it — my role was just to turn up and enjoy! So I had no idea what other attractions were within walking distance. But we were pretty sure there would be a cafe where we could sit and watch the world go by fairly close by.
We walked past the street sellers, their souvenirs spread out on tarpaulins, and approached the river. My attention was drawn to the building on my left, first the light stone walls, then the darker brick of the heart of the castle, and I was hit by the strangest feeling of déjà vu. I knew this building, it’s curved ramparts, the flagpole on top. But this was my first trip to Rome. Why was a place I’d never been to so familiar?

Rome might be it for me. The one. The city above all others. The one you find yourself Googling flights to late at night, even when you’ve just arrived home from your last trip.
I think we all have places like that.
A few months ago, I visited Rome for the fourth time. One of those times was a month-long trip and I can tell you, it was one of the highlights of my three-year-long travels. I never wanted to leave because Rome has exactly what I love in a city. Beauty. Atmosphere. And one of my favourite food and drink cultures in the world.
Yes, there are tourist traps. Yes, some places will give you a raw deal in bad pasta, bad pizza and bad wine. But there is also value to be found. You can find pizza that will do things to you. You can eat pasta that will ruin every other pasta you eat henceforth (it’s that good).
If you want to eat and drink well in this city, you’ve just got to know where to go.
Every day in Rome starts with a caffè and a maritozzo — Rome’s famous cream-filled…

Rizky Bayuputra for LC Life
LE CITOYEN — Ancient Rome is undoubtedly a civilisation to be looked upon. Albeit known for their ‘pagan extravagance,’ the ancient Romans did, however, conquer and create a nation state that ranged from the borders of Scotland to the deserts of Arabia, reaching its height in the 2nd century CE and influence modern western life more than any other ancient civilisation (alongside the Greeks). However, there are only a few good examples of films and TV series that depict Roman life as it should. Films such as Gladiator, despite its well-written plot, presented a lot of inaccuracies. Meanwhile, TV-series such as Spartacus were, well, rather vulgar — not saying that Roman society wasn’t like that — but for a historical TV show, it showed parts of Roman culture that should have been, let’s say, set behind curtains and exaggerated at that! However, one TV series has put me, as an avid enthusiast of all things Greco-Roman, to stop my various nitpicks and just sit down and enjoy. With an unbelievably stellar plot and deep research into Roman life, the HBO Series Rome (first launched in 2006), terribly underrated in comparison to the likes of Game of Thrones, is what I could say (and most historians do agree) a highly-authentic depiction of Roman life.
Albeit historians having pointed out a few inaccuracies (especially in the timeline), what HBO’s Rome brought was much better: authenticity. It immersed yourself into the world, made you care about the characters, and anxiously sit on your chair as you watch the series go on, waiting for what other secrets of Ancient Rome might be uncovered.
Overview
Over two seasons, the TV miniseries Rome follows Lucius Vorenus (played by Kevin McKidd) and Titus Pullo (played by Ray Stevenson), two soldiers of the Roman legion and therefore Roman citizens, as they go through turbulent times in Roman history. Vorenus and Pullo are both members of the plebeian class–or the common citizenry–of Rome back in the dying days of the Republic and so gives us a lot of new perspectives on ancient Roman life. While also following the high politics of Gaius Julius Caesar (played by Ciaran Hinds, who later featured in Game of Thrones as the wildling King, Mance Rayder), and his civil wars against Pompey, which is already a recurring theme as depicted by popular media, such as multiple films on the life of Caesar and most well-known the plays written by one William Shakespeare, it does not relieve us of the grit and severity of the common man’s life.
Historically, the Romans operated on a not-so-rigid class system dictated by ancestry and wealth. The three classes of Roman citizens, which are the Patricians, Equites (or Knights, who became important mid-level civil and military officials as well as cavalrymen), and Plebeians (common citizenry, who became tradesmen, merchants, artisans, rank-and-file soldiers), lived very different lives and worked different livelihoods. The Patricians, or the senatorial class, act as the primary ruling class during Republican times. Patrician families were allowed entry into the senate on the basis of their wealth and ancestry. Some Patrician families claim descent from the Gods (Caesar’s family, or the Julii Caesaris, claim their descent from the goddess Venus) despite their claim to a seat of senator is mostly based on their ancestry, drawing back to early or pre-Republican times. Famous senatorial “gentes” (or clans) include that of the Cornelii (for example, Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus, the victor of the Battle of Zama against Hannibal Barca in c. 202 BC), Junii (for example, the overthrower of the last King of Rome, Lucius Junius Brutus), the Porcii (Marcus Porcius Cato, famous Roman orator, though the younger one live in Caesar’s times).
Not surprisingly, descendants or the adopted benefactors of said gens lived in the timeframe depicted in Rome, represented by members of the Optimate faction, which consisted of traditionalist Roman senators who wanted to preserve oligarchic rule in defence of Republican institutions, including Scipio Metellus, Marcus Junius Brutus (descendant of said Brutus, played by Tobias Menzies, later as Edmure Tully in Game of Thrones), Gaius Cassius Longinus, and Marcus Porcius Cato the Younger, all serving under the charismatic brilliance of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, Caesar’s once-ally and nemesis. These characters go up against, in the damnably byzantine politics and battlefields of antiquity, the Populares faction, with Gaius Julius Caesar at its head, and Marcus Antonius (popularly known in his anglicised form of ‘Mark Antony,’ depicted as a fantasist, narcissist, brutal and temperamental soldier by Antony Purefoy’s brilliant acting) by his side.
The two main protagonists, Centurion Lucius Vorenus and Legionary Titus Pullo, are members of the Roman Thirteenth Legion, of whom Caesar led through his long Gallic wars. Rome goes through the plebeian lives of the two soldiers, introducing not only events in history, but also of Roman culture through daily life, something I found very interesting. As there are too many aspects of Roman life depicted within the HBO Series (and thus the corresponding budget, which was the reason why it was cancelled after its second season), we will take it from a few aspects and how every film set in a historical background or piece of literary fiction should take into account to bring said world into life.
Traditions and Religion
Roman religion and tradition is deeply ingrained within its society. Notably, the Roman state and religion were never seen as two different things by Roman society. The various cults and sects of the Roman pantheon, along with the various deities of Jupiter (the king of the gods, lord of the sky and thunder), Dis (god of the underworld, most notably used by soldiers and fighters especially in damning a certain thing), and even Vesta were depicted with superlative detail. Note the sacrifices conducted in some episodes, the reading of omens, the praying to small figurines in a homely shrine, and the entry of one of Vorenus’ daughter into the Vestal Virgins later on in the season.
The Vestal Virgins themselves were one of the most interesting parts of Roman tradition and religion; they were selected from highborn women at a very young age to enter priesthood and vowed to be chaste for the next 30 years in order to cultivate the sacred fire, located in the temple of Vesta. Vesta herself was the Roman goddess of the hearth, marked by the existence of Vesta’s sacred fire which must not be let out under any circumstances. Superstition was, that if the fire died, it meant that the goddess had abandoned her protection of Rome–meaning that the infernal city itself was under grave danger.
Aside from religion, Rome also depicted many other Roman traditions, such as the patricians’ obscene eating habits of lying down on sofa-like furniture while conversing and getting absolutely drunk as well as exceptionally extravagant, drug-filled orgies. One other interesting event in Rome was the marking of the coming-of-age. Every male Roman citizen was given the right to wear a toga at the age of sixteen (or seventeen, depending on which is closest to 15 March of the year) and therefore participate as adults in civil society. The depiction of Octavian’s (the future Roman Emperor Augustus) coming-of-age rite of passage was depicted at the near-end of season one, something that would drastically change his way of thought and vibrate his transition from boy to man so visible in the transition of seasons.
Also quite interesting was the portrayal of tradesman guilds. In the series, the Herald (the rather bulky fellow with iconic hand gestures) in the forum of Rome mentions in an ‘advertisement’ of sorts, the Roman Guild of Bakers, while mention of guilds of smiths of some sort took place throughout the series.
Aside from Roman religion, Jews were also featured. Timon (Lee Boardman), one of the supporting characters, is depicted as a cutthroat sellsword serving Atia of the Julii (Polly Walker), in more than one way. He is dragged in a conspiracy when the Tetrarch of Galilee (Jewish Royalty) arrives in Rome for ‘adminsitrative business.’
Military Service and Tactics
Military service was a large part of Roman life. Soldiering was considered honourable and serving Rome was, after all, a citizen’s unwritten obligation. In the dying days of the Republic, the Romans had already established a professional volunteer army (in comparison to levied troops, which was the system that prevailed up into the 18th century), allowing the fighting of successive wars all across her borders and the gradual expansion of the Pax Romana. Citizen-soldiers like Pullo and Vorenus were obliged with 20 years’ service and were entitled to a percentage of booty and war prizes. After retirement, ‘old legionaries’ may sign up again to become evocati, or veteran troops, serving as the crack troops held in reserve in battles, who earned multiple times the wage of a normal soldier and were immune to menial duties. This took place when Vorenus decided to take Mark Antony’s offer to join his army as a ‘Prefect of the Evocati Cohort,’ a traditionally equestrian position, of which Vorenus had achieved (Equestrian status was achievable after the ownership of 10,000 sesterces in assets, after all). He also had to go through an interesting rite of passage to get it.
Roman military tactics were depicted according to commentaries of the time, such as the Comentarii de Bello Gallico by Caesar. Roman legionaries fought in close formation, standardly going in formation 10-across and 8-deep (in a rectangular formation of 80 men each, called a century). With shields raised, legionaries covered their sectors, and watched for each other. Upon a certain amount of time, the centurion would blow a whistle to signify the change of the foremost front man, and the first-ranker quickly switched to the man behind him. This allowed equal distribution of the fighting, thus allowing Roman legionaries to fight longer than their counterparts. This was depicted well in the opening scene (perhaps the Battle of Alesia) and the epic Battle of Phillipi (in the second series) between Brutus and the second Triumvirate (Octavian Caesar, Antony, and Lepidus). Uniforms and arms were also accurate to the era, with the Roman soldiers wearing in variation of military tunics in scarlet and off-white (undyed) colours, while wearing lorica hamata or mail cuirass, instead of the inaccurately portrayed lorica segmentata (segmented plate armour cuirass) often used in games and films. This type of armour was not used in the time of Caesar, however, and came in the later Imperial period of the first century to third century AD, in limited use. The ‘square’ Roman shield (scutum), the pilum and pila (throwables or javelins), and the gladius hispanensis (Spanish sword), the Celt-inspired republican helmet (galea) along with the not-so-famous Roman sarcina, or luggage, which each legionary brought their own, were also pictured widely.
Turmoil and Squalor
Viewers could often see the tough-living, dirty, and ragged streets of Rome, then one of the most populous and advanced cities throughout the Mediterranean. Even the home of the Vorenii, where Lucius Vorenus and his family lived, was not as fancy as one would think of the ‘extravagant’ Romans. Many of the citizens of Rome lived in poverty and in a state of squalor; murder was not uncommon, and gang fights over disputes were perhaps the way most citizens preferred it to be finished. Courts of law did exist in Rome, but not really portrayed within the TV series.
Another interesting fact was that the Romans often used grafitti to express themselves. Naturally, due to this, the walls of the small streets in Rome were decorated with entertaining, and sometimes perverse, pictures courtesy of Your Fellow Citizen.
Clothing and Fashion
Roman society also had its dress codes. Formal occasions were marked by the wearing of the toga (broad, purple-stripe for senators, two stripes for equestrian/knights, and a plain white for plebeians) for men, although in day-to-day life, a tunic–a piece of cloth that went down to above the knees–were worn. For the regular citizen, these tunics were mostly plain and sometimes dyed, though for nobility, the tunic was often decorated with embroidery to display status. The Romans did live by the code ‘you are what you wear’–perhaps something that lives down to Italians today.
For women, the stola was the most common dress, in tandem with the toga. Stolae were somehow a timeless piece, with variations worn from the times of the mid-republic (3rd century BC) up to the late Byzantine Empire (15th century AD). Women who wore the stola were seen as graceful and honourable, and this was depicted in the various forms of the stola, from a light, near-transparent garment to the rich deep red and/or other colours of whatever Atia of the Julii (a depiction of a woman of extravagance) wore throughout the series. Stola were mostly worn by married women, to display modesty and maturity. Younger women often wore tunics inspired by the Greek chiton (as were many parts of Roman culture).
Despite in a short space of two seasons, it was remarkable how much of ancient Rome was able to be portrayed by the series. The antics of Titus Pullo, the stoicism of Lucius Vorenus, the extravagance of Mark Antony, the grace and shrewdness of Cleopatra, the smart power-plays of Caesar, and the idealism of Brutus were all depicted well within Rome. Although it was cancelled, it had managed to amaze many ancient history enthusiasts with its authenticity and exploration of each character through personal and interpersonal conflicts. If you want to create a period drama, just write for fun, or want to binge watch something exceptionally, and I say again, exceptionally, good, Le Citoyen highly recommends HBO’s Rome.
Plus, if you’re waiting for Game of Thrones’ final season, and want to watch a series of a such (but based on real events), go watch it. Wherever you can. Go! Go!
Salutations.

Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus.
I know what you’re thinking.
What a name!
I agree.
Sadly, the man with this name is responsible for a lot of naughty nonsense.
First off, he murdered his own mother.
If that wasn’t enough, he also murdered his first wife.
And his second wife?
Kicked her to death while she was pregnant.
Yeah, we’re dealing with a monstrosity.
Sadly, his cruelty wasn’t just reserved for his close family members.
He also used to host parties where he’d light people on fire (usually Christians) while he and his guests would frolic to fiddle music.
All while, Rome was engulfed in flames.

Helpful hints on how to have a miserable but interesting time in the Eternal City.
Listen, I love Rome. I really do but now that we’re more or less free to travel again, I feel compelled to fill you in on the Eternal City. Masochists will love it. So will anybody else drawn to stress and anxiety. Don’t get me wrong, Rome has a lot of things going for it. Historical buildings, pizza, magnificent museums, pizza, stunning churches, pizza. Did I say pizza? Over four million tourists a year visit the Eternal City and, for the most part, Rome is prepared. Yet there are a few trouble spots that can turn a Roman holiday into a Roman nightmare.
Rome is always crowded and those walking tours led by tour guides with flags or umbrellas only make things worse. These human centipedes shuffle, and I do mean shuffle, along the sidewalk and hold up the rest of us with places to go. They’re everywhere but particularly dense around the Vatican Museum and the Trevi Fountain. Especially the Tevi. The Fountain is hemmed in by narrow streets that funnel pedestrians into the site like sheep to the slaughter. Good luck with getting a clear view. Keep in mind there are equally…

Book Review: Are We Rome? The Fall of an Empire and the Fate of America by Cullen Murphy,https://medium.com/@desireewinns/book-review-are-we-rome-the-fall-of-an-empire-and-the-fate-of-america-by-cullen-murphy-6ba9c929abf2,"Sign up

Is America the new Roman Empire, and if so, will it meet the same fate? This book argues that America and Rome are similar in terms of their psychology and soft power, from the way Washington and Rome view themselves as the center of their worlds, to the global and historical impacts of their cultures. In the beginning, Murphy notes Freud’s comparison of the human psyche and the ruins of Rome, the possibility of histories existing simultaneously rather than one after the other. It’s a theme that runs throughout each chapter as Murphy compares the militaries, borders, people, and cultures of Rome and America. Considering how much Roman culture and iconography shape the ways Americans symbolize and discuss their own power, it really does seem like Rome and America exist together. However, Murphy posits that America’s capability for relatively rapid social transformation (especially in just two centuries) is what separates it from its doomed predecessor, and what will save it from the same fate. I’d pick this book up if you’re interested in learning how the cultural and psychological power of empires expands beyond centuries. In the end you’ll definitely wonder if Rome ever did fall.

Rome is a city of amazing pizza, pasta, and gelato, but if you’re looking for a healthy break from all those delicious carbs, here are 4 great places where you can get fresh juices and smoothies:
Esco Sazio — This adorable little shop offers completely organic juices and smoothies, in addition to healthy sandwiches and salads. Swing on one of their wooden swings as you drink your juice and enjoy the chalkboard-meets-chandelier ambiance. Our girls loved the chocolate banana protein smoothie, and I enjoyed my tropical juice with pineapple and guava.
Via dei Banchi Vecchi, 135, 00186 Roma, Italy
Pronto — We stumbled across this restaurant in Rome’s Monti neighborhood, near the Colosseum, and stopped in when we saw their “fresh juices” sign. Their fruit is freshly chopped, juiced, and blended (if you get juice with pears in it) right in front of you, and the three juices that we tried were all fantastic. You can take your juice outside and hang out at the fountain with the locals while you drink it and take in the area’s energetic vibe.
Via dei Serpenti, 163, Roma
Aromaticus — This restaurant is also in the trendy Monti area, and they serve fresh juices and clean, mostly raw and unprocessed foods (salads, hummus, beef tartare, etc.). The shop itself is cute and hip, decorated with vintage cookbooks and selling potted herbs and gardening supplies, and the food and juice are excellent. The pineapple-mint juice was one of the best juices I’ve ever had, so perfectly sweet and delicious, and Joshua loved his Greek salad with pita bread, hummus, cherry tomatoes, olives, and feta cheese.
Via Urbana, 134, 00184 Roma, Italy
AllBiOne — Self-described as “organic street food”, AllBiOne serves organic juices, cut-up fresh fruit, and 14 different kinds of organic meatballs… everything from beef and tomato or chicken and curry to vegetarian eggplant parmesan or ricotta and pecorino cheese balls. Everything we ate was tasty, but I highly recommend the cheese “meat”balls, and the juices we got were fresh and delicious.
The restaurant is a short walk from the Colosseum, and the owner is really friendly — he overheard us talking about wanting strawberries in a juice for the girls, and he offered to make a strawberry-apple-orange juice for them that wasn’t listed on the board; it turned out to be perfect for them!
Largo Corrado Ricci, 34, Roma, Italy
Do you know another great juice bar in Rome? Leave a comment and share it with us!

We had been waiting 30 minutes for the tour to begin. Stepping into a small spot of shade, I wiped the sweat from my face. It was only 10:30, and already the temperature had soared to 95.
“I thought this tour was supposed to start at 10,” I grumbled to my husband, who was also angling for shade.
“It was also supposed to be a private tour,” he said. “But there are 19 of us.”
My husband and I like private tours when we travel, to avoid the sort of scenario we were currently experiencing. Group tour guides are informative and engaging, but there are always tourists who can’t keep up, want to cut the excursion short, or show up late.
Today, two people hadn’t shown up. The excursion was supposed to be a nine-hour walking tour of Rome, and I was ready to get started. Our guide, an Italian woman with thick, black hair and a round face flushed with heat, tried to keep the 19 tourists in our group cheerful.
“Just a few more minutes. I believe the late ones are coming,” she chirped, forcing a smile. “Ah! Here they are!”
I watched as two grumpy blonde women trudged through the crowd towards our group. One was youngish, her expression…

As is well-known, Rome was founded by the legendary brothers Romulus and Remus, who originated from Alba Longa and belonged to one of the Latin tribes. However, as Rome grew into a vast and powerful state, the Romans decided having only local Italian shepherds among their ancestors wasn’t very prestigious. It would be much cooler if the Romans descended from a well-known, celebrated people in legends, even better — from a great hero. And they found such a heroic ancestor. He was Aeneas, a hero from Troy who left his homeland after the city’s fall.
This legend did not immediately become widely accepted among the Romans. The 1st-century BC Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus presents three versions of the Roman origins he knew: Italy, Libya, and Greece. In the last case, he refers to Greek colonists who had long lived on the Apennine Peninsula. However, Dionysius favored the view that the Romans were of mixed Greek-Italian origin. At the same time, Dionysius mentions the Roman version that Romulus and Remus were sons of Aeneas, implying that Rome was built by the second generation of Trojan refugees.

Celebrating the Western tradition, from Romulus to Rembrandt.

The traditional story of Rome’s founding is a classic tale, one that every schoolchild used to learn. One of the greatest civilizations of the Western world, Rome shaped our modern society more than any other ancient culture (with the possible exception of Greece). To understand the incredible story — somewhat dubious historicity aside — is to gain insight into the folklore and heritage that have inspired twenty-five centuries of thinkers, creators, rulers, and ordinary people who looked backwards at the mistakes and achievements of the past for wisdom and direction in the present.
Many charge that learning such tales in the Digital Age is anachronistic at best and exclusionary at worst. But there is undeniably something transcendent about them, a special quality that explains Rome’s unique ability to capture the hearts and souls of luminaries from every time and place, from Dante to Gibbon to Toni Morrison.
Studying the history of ancient Rome ought not to be an exercise in self-flagellation, in which one allows the often-savage realities of the ancient world to overshadow the innovations and triumphs of an extraordinary time. Instead, it ought to be a celebration of the grandeur that was Rome, imperfections and all, and a recognition of the seminal role she played in shaping the West.
And so without further ado I present the traditional and mythological history of Ancient Rome from its founding to its fall in three parts.
On April 21, 753 BC, the twins Romulus and Remus stood atop a rather unremarkable Italian hillock — it was known as the “Palatine” — and founded a small settlement that would rise to become one of the most dominant and lasting empires in world history. This ten-part survey briefly traces the traditional and legendary history of Rome, over the course of which I shall attempt to answer the crucial question: how did a diminutive encampment on the Palatine rise to global dominance, and what became of its grandeur?
Our story begins at Troy. According to legend, in the 1200s BC a titanic struggle was waged between the Greeks and the Trojans, inhabitants of a city known as Troy upon the Dardanelles in modern-day Turkey. The cause of the war was divine; three of the most prominent goddesses in the Greek pantheon (Hera, queen of the gods; Athena, goddess of wisdom; and Aphrodite, goddess of sexual love) found themselves in the midst of a passionate disagreement over who was the most beautiful. To settle their dispute, Zeus (king of the gods) appointed Paris, a Trojan prince, as judge. Attempting to sway Paris, each of the three goddesses offered him a precious reward should he choose her, but it was Aphrodite’s offer — that he be wed to Helen, wife of a Greek king called Menelaus — that was most convincing to the Trojan squire. Her promise was swiftly delivered upon, and Helen was spirited away from the court of Menelaus to the high walls of Priam, king of Troy.
War followed forthwith, as Greeks hastened to Troy to support Menelaus and reclaim his snatched wife from Paris. The fighting was intense, lengthy, and heroic — much of it is retold in Homer’s Iliad, most especially the exploits of a Greek general named Achilles. At last, supported by many of the gods and aided by cunning trickery in the “Trojan Horse” (a fake peace offering that in fact contained Greek soldiers within its belly, allowing the marauders to flood the city by night and open its gates to the invaders waiting outside), the Greeks breached the walls, and began to pillage and burn.
From the carnage escaped a particular Trojan prince — Aeneas, a son of Venus — accompanied by a retinue of comrades. In search of friendly lands and a place to found a new city, he set out from Troy by ship and, after an arduous journey, arrived on the shores of North Africa to a city called Carthage (modern-day Tunis), the home of Queen Dido. The people were friendly, milk and honey flowed, and, most notoriously, Dido and Aeneas fell into the throngs of love for one another, a rather scandalous affair for the previously-unbetrothed Dido and the now-uxorious Aeneas. Alas, this was not to be the Romans’ final home; for Hermes, the messenger god, flitted down to Aeneas, whom he found strutting bejeweled atop the high walls of Carthage, and bore to him a fateful message from Zeus himself: Aeneas must head to Latium (the region of Italy around modern-day Rome), as was his fate. Immediately, devoted Aeneas (or pius Aeneas, as goes the famous Latin phrase) set out, and soon reaches Latium. However, his departure was not casualty-free; in a fit of woeful despair at seeing her lover gone, Dido stabbed herself to death, leaving a final curse on the Trojans that shall reappear later in this survey. Much of the tale of Aeneas’ journey to Rome, it should be noted, is retold in Vergil’s Aeneid.
Thus we conclude the first chapter of Rome’s history, with Trojan ships on Latian sands.
Having shored in Italy, “Aeneas f[ound] not peace but another terrible war” (Ragan, Survey). A local king, Latinus, sparked conflict when he betrothed his daughter Lavinia to the newly arrived Aeneas instead of the man to whom he had already promised her, Turnus. In the ensuing strife, in which the Trojan-Latinus coalition fought Turnus and his local allies, Aeneas slew Turnus and subsequently married Lavinia. He died in another skirmish shortly afterward.
Aeneas’ body was never recovered, but his name remains forever etched into the towering stele of Western civilization, a fleeting ember of once-mighty Troy rekindled into the blazing inferno that was Rome. His legacy would be taken up by his young son Ascanius (also known as Iulus). The year, as legend has it, is circa 1175 BC.
Thirty or so years later, Ascanius founded the town of Alba Longa in the nearby Alban Hills, about twenty miles east of the Seven Hills that will later mark the famous site of Rome. Ascanius is the first in a 400-year line of Alban kings — the so-called Silvian Dynasty — that ends with King Proca and his two sons: Numitor (the elder) and Amulius (the younger). Upon Proca’s death sometime in the 8th century BC, Numitor, being the elder brother, ought to have inherited the throne. Amulius, however, had other plans, and he usurped the throne, murdered Numitor’s sons, and cast Numitor himself into exile. In a rather Machiavellian twist, wanting to end his brother’s bloodline Amulius forced Numitor’s daughter Rhea Silvia to become a Vestal Virgin, consigning her to celibate priestesshood.
Divine intervention followed forthwith, and Rhea Silvia became impregnated by Mars, the god of war [virgin pregnancies tend to resurface, no?]. Amulius orders the products of the pregnancy, twin boys named Romulus and Remus, to be left on the banks of the Tiber River to perish [cue Moses…]. Escaping doom, the twins were found and nursed by a she-wolf who brought them to a cave known as “the Lupercal.” Soon thereafter, the infants were found by a shepherd, Faustulus, who took them in and raised them as his own (along with his wife, Acca Larentia). Eventually, having discovered their family background and having learned of the injustice Amulius had wrought, they wrested back control of Alba Longa and restored Numitor, their now-agéd grandfather, to the throne. Wrongs thus righted, the brothers set out, looking to found a city of their own.
The twins and their followers journeyed west to a marshy spot near the Tiber River, ringed by seven hills: the Palatine, the Quirinal, the Viminal, the Esquiline, the Caelian, the Aventine, and the Capitoline. Romulus surmounted the Palatine hill and began setting the boundaries of a new hamlet, Rome. The legendary date of this founding is April 21, 753 B.C. Remus, in brotherly scorn, leapt over the Rome’s diminutive walls. Romulus, ever the patriot, felled his brother with his blade, declaring, “Sic deinde, quicumque alius transiliet moenia mea” — “Thus henceforth to anyone who should o’erleap my bulwarks.”
Rid of pesky Remus, Romulus set to the task of governance and growth, making Rome (specifically the Capitoline hill) an asylum that welcomed all who wished to join the new town. Unsurprisingly, such an arrangement attracted a less-than-ideal rabble — the men were raucous and criminal, the women sparse. Stung by a neighboring tribe’s refusal to provide their daughters in marriage to the Roman ruffians, Romulus announced a Festival of Neptune (the sea god) in his new town, attracting scores of local tribespeople. With the beady eyes of the Romans fixed upon the Sabine daughters — the young, gallivanting women from the Sabine tribe — Romulus gave the signal, and the Romans rushed out from their hidey-holes, each seizing a Sabine lass for his own and absconding back onto the fortified heights of the Palatine. The festival, needless to say, quickly dispersed.
The Roman snatching — or, as it became known, “The Rape of the Sabine Women” — was rather poorly received by the duped Sabines, who quickly armed themselves and prepared to make battle. Skirmishes ensued, but the final engagement of the war, the Battle of the Lacus Curtius, was ended when the Roman wives (yes, the very Sabine girls who had only recently been kidnapped) threw themselves into the fray and demanded that conflict cease in an event often called “The Intervention of the Sabine Women.” Impelled to peace, the two towns merged, the new entity jointly ruled by Romulus and Titus Tatius, the king of the Sabines.
Around this time Romulus went about planting the societal seeds that would sprout into the grand trunks of Roman civilization. To one hundred hand-picked followers he gave the title “patres” — “fathers”. These men would serve in an official capacity as his advisory council, the Senate. The descendants of these early “fathers” would later be known as the “patricii,” or “Patricians.” The rest of the citizenry were merely the “plebs,” or “Plebeians.” From the union of these two delineated strata (the Senate and the masses) comes the famous phrase SPQR — “Senatus PopulusQue Romanus,” or “the Senate and People of Rome.” Another division of the city — thirty “curiae,” named after thirty of the Sabine women who had intervened — provided the voting units of the “Comitia Curiata,” or “Roman Assembly.”
Over the next several years of his rule (by now Titus Tatius had perished during a riot in nearby Lavinium, leaving Romulus the sole king), Romulus oversaw the city’s continued growth as it pressed outward in conquest. In the late 8th century B.C., Romulus died when, while surveying the troops arranged on the Campus Martius (Plain of Mars) from the Quirinal hill, a cloud enshrouded him. When the cloud lifted, Romulus was nowhere to be found — either murdered in a conspiracy by the Senators or, as the Roman historian Livy more dubiously asserts, ascended to heaven under the auspices of Mars. Romulus was later deified under the name “Quirinus,” attracting a significant cult following. He reigned for thirty-seven years, the first of Rome’s “Seven Kings.”
Thus we conclude the second chapter of our history of Rome, with Romulus dead and a new king, as we shall soon see, poised to spring from the ashes.
Somewhat unusually, the Roman kingship was elective: The Senate nominated new kings during the interregna that followed monarchs’ deaths (during which nominating process various Senators would serve as temporary rulers), and the Assembly confirmed or rejected those nominees. The arrangements surrounding Romulus’ succession were no exception; the lengthy, one-year interregnum that followed Romulus’ death saw ten Senators rule as interregnes, or “between-kings,” before a worthy successor was nominated and confirmed: Numa Pompilius, Rome’s second king.
Numa Pompilius: The Pacifist and Priest (r. 716–673 BC)
Numa’s accession betokened a city exhausted from the constant conflict and rapid expansion of Romulus’ reign: more scholar than fighter, Numa was famed for his disciplined lifestyle, religious dedication, and vast wisdom. Numa’s selection marked a successful compromise between the Roman and Sabine factions of the population — though himself a Sabine himself from the town of Cures, Numa was uncontroversial and widely respected, characteristics that rendered him acceptable to each of the bickering factions.
Numa is chiefly remembered for his pacifism and his institution of the sacra, Rome’s religious traditions. Among his first decrees as monarch was the dissolution of the guard that had comprised Romulus’ personal entourage — an act both of peacemaking and self-preservation, as the guards’ loyalty was questionable. One of Numa’s most significant contributions was the establishment of several priestly orders, including pontifices and flamines (higher and lower classes, respectively, of standard priests), the Salii (the twelve so-called “leaping priests” of Mars), the fetiales (the priests who advised the Senate on treaties, foreign affairs, and official declarations of war), and the Pontifex Maximus, the high priest of Rome. Most significantly, he imported from Alba Longa the Vestal Virgins — the famed priestesses of Vesta (goddess of the hearth) who, as ceremonial stewards of all Rome, kept her sacred fire aflame. Numa also constructed several temples, including the famous Temple of Janus, whose doors were closed during peacetime and flung open during wars. Tellingly, the doors remained closed for Numa’s entire reign. Another of his lasting contributions was the institution of a twelve-month calendar adjusted to the solar and lunar years, with provisions for “holy” and “unholy” days.
Throughout his reign, Numa asserted his direct connection to the gods by means of his marriage to Egeria, a nymph who supposedly furnished him with divine directives upon his periodic visits to her. Numa died of old age in 673 BC, having presided over a long period of peace and productivity in the city on the Tiber.
Tullus Hostilius: The Warrior (r. 673–642 BC)
Where Numa was priest, Tullus was warrior. Scornful of the religious obsession that had settled over the city and believing Rome to have grown “soft” under Numa’s pacifism, Tullus Hostilius set about renewing the military prowess the city had enjoyed under Romulus and sought to expand its imperium, or “sphere of influence” (later “empire”). Tullus waged war on several neighboring peoples, including the Sabines (whom he defeated with a cavalry charge in a battle near Malitiosa Forest, inflicting heavy casualties), the confederated Veientes and Fidenates (whom he defeated even despite the treacherous retreat of Rome’s Alban “allies”), and even Alba Longa, the ancient birthplace of Romulus. It is this final conquest for which Tullus is best known today.
Cattle begat the strife. When a small herd of the beasts (owned by a Roman farmer) wandered into Alban territory, and the relevant landowners refused to return them to Rome, Tullus did what any reasonable leader might have done: He declared war against all Alba Longa. Undaunted, the Albans marshaled themselves under their king, Cluilius, and marched to the outskirts of Rome. Quickly, they dug a trench — the aptly-named Cluilian trench — around the entire city. Soon, though, Cluilius perished of unspecified causes. [“Cluilius… moritur,” the Roman historian Livy helpfully elaborates: “Cluilius dies” (Ab Urbe Condita, 1.23.4).]
To replace Cluilius, the Albans appointed Mettius Fufetius as military dictator, granting him absolute command over the city and its forces. The two leaders — Tullus and Fufetius — drew up their armies into battle and marched out to face each other. Neither side wanting to wage what would surely be a bloody and destructive war — for the neighboring Etruscans would have looked on with glee as their two main territorial rivals tore each other to shreds, ready to swoop in and conquer the weakened victor — Fufetius suggested a more efficient resolution: a duel. Miraculously, each army had among its ranks a set of triplets: the Romans had the Horatii brothers, and the Albans had the Curiatii brothers. The teams of brothers would fight to the bloody death for their countries, and Tullus and Fufetius each entered into solemn vows pledging that they would abide by the outcome of the fight. I borrow from Ragan’s Survey to recount the conflict that ensued:
The contest was exciting: with two Horatians slain, but all three Curiatians wounded, the surviving Horatius began to flee! The Romans no doubt groaned, thinking their champion a coward. But there was method in this. For as he ran, he succeeded in separating the pursuing Curiatii whom he was able to fight individually and each of whom he killed. So, the Albans surrendered themselves and their town. The Romans, however, characteristic of these early wars, took the Albans as a whole into their citizen body; the town was destroyed — except for the temples — so that the Albans would become fully a part of their new community.
So, with that, Romulus’ hometown was no more, living on only in the memory of its now-Roman residents. A final finishing twist to conclude the conflict: the Alban dictator, Fufetius, soon proved a treacherous man. In the aforementioned Roman war against the Fidenates, it was he who pulled the Albans back from the fight, intending to linger in the backdrop until a winner was evident, at which point he would march out in “victory,” pretending to have supported whoever won. But Tullus was no fool: perceiving Fufetius’ treachery, he bade his calvary raise their spears, shielding the retreating Alban “allies” from view of his infantry and thus keeping the Roman morale intact, preserving Rome’s shot at victory. After the battle, Tullus punished Fufetius (also known by his first name, Metius) as he saw fit. I leave it to Vergil to recount the gory details of Metius’ death as he is ripped limb from limb by four horses (Aeneid Book VIII, tr. John Dryden):
Near this, the traitor Metius, stretch’d betweenFour fiery steeds, is dragg’d along the green,By Tullus’ doom: the brambles drink his blood,And his torn limbs are left the vulture’s food.
In addition to these military conquests, Tullus is notable for his construction of a new Senate building — the Curia Hostilia — which lasted for over 500 years after his death.
Alas, for all his military grandeur Tullus had neglected to honor the gods, and soon the city was afflicted with plague and famine as recompense for his scanty religiosity. Desperate, Tullus turned to the writings of his predecessor Numa, the expert on all things divine, and frantically yet inaccurately attempted to perform the rituals described therein. The gods, in no mood to tolerate such tomfoolery, struck Tullus with a thunderbolt, setting both him and his palace alight and bringing an end to his 31-year rule.
Ancus Marcius: The Builder (r. 640–616 BC)
Perhaps weary again of conflict and conquest, the Romans chose the more subdued Ancus Marcius — grandson of Numa — as their fourth king. Where Tullus had erred in the eyes of the gods, Ancus charted a safer course: his first act as king was to have the religious rites laid down by Numa copied down and displayed to the public, lest they ever again be ill-performed.
By Ancus’ time, Rome had become a profitable and well-positioned town controlling a respectable portion of Latium, the territorial region around the city. The city lay along the Via Salaria, or Salt Road, an ancient trading route that proved a welcome boon to the growing city. Taking advantage of the city’s strategic position, Ancus sent out a colonia (colony) of citizens to found Ostia at the mouth of the Tiber, a crucial expedition that secured the surrounding salt flats (providing a reliable revenue stream for the fledgling city) and extended Roman territory to the sea. He constructed the first bridge across the Tiber, the Pons Sublicius (Sublician Bridge), in 642 BC. The continued arrival of Etruscans from the north, skilled engineers in masonry, road construction, and swamp drainage, further complemented Ancus’ infrastructure projects. He built Rome’s first prison, the Mamertine Prison (which, in the following centuries, housed a number of high-profile prisoners, including Vercingetorix, Jugurtha, St. Peter, and Sejanus), atop the Capitoline hill. He fortified the Janiculum hill on the west bank of the Tiber, dug a ditch fortification (the Fossa Quiritium) on the city’s landward side, and constructed Rome’s first aqueduct.
Though more peaceful than his predecessor, Ancus did not shrink from conflict; he fought against the Latins, conquering the town of Politorum (whose residents were relocated to the base of the Aventine hill in Rome) — and later reconquering and destroying it when it was re-settled by more Latin peoples — along with Tellenae, Ficana, and Medullia, a conquest that brought loot to the coffers of Ancus and resettled Latins to the base of the Palatine hill. These resettlements, along with a growing population and increasing social stratification, helped form the early stages of the plebeian class at Rome. Furthermore, he expanded Roman territory into the Maesian Forest, seizing it from the Veientes.
After 24 years of successful rule, Ancus, the last of Rome’s Latin-Sabine kings, died, bringing to a close a period of economic and territorial expansion, infrastructure development, and social growth for the adolescent town on the banks of the Tiber.
Thus we conclude the third chapter of our brief history of Rome, with four successful kings etched into the people’s memory and new rulers from the north poised to take the throne.
During the reign of Ancus Marcius (640–616 BC), a talented man named Lucomo arrived from Etruria, a civilization to the north of Rome, with his wife, Tanaquil. Lucomo brought his peoples’ skill in engineering, stonework, and logistics; Tanaquil, their prowess in omen interpretation. According to tradition, this power couple was destined for greatness from the moment of their arrival at Rome: As they approached the city, an eagle swooped down, stole Lucomo’s hat, and quickly replaced it. Tanaquil, the “impartial” wife and observer, deemed this an omen of his future greatness.
Biased as it was, Tanaquil’s observation soon came to fruition. At Rome, Lucomo took the name “Lucius Tarquinius” (“Priscus,” meaning “Elder,” was later added — we shall soon see why), gained access to the city’s high society through favor and courtesy, and, eventually, became a friend of the aging Ancus. So close an associate of Ancus’ was he that the king named him guardian of his two sons, both mere youths. But this was a decision that would prove fatal for the line of poor Ancus.
With old Ancus on his deathbed in 616 BC, crafty Tarquin (or, more likely, the ambitious Tanaquil) sent the two sons on a lengthy hunting expedition. When Ancus died shortly thereafter, Tarquin leapt into action, making a case for his own election to the kingship before the Curiate Assembly (the thirty-tribe popular assembly presided over by the king — recall the thirty curiae named after the intervening Sabine women), a case he bolstered with bribery. Needless to say, he succeeded: The two sons, away on their jolly hunt, were exiled, and Lucius Tarquinius Priscus — better known by the anglicized Tarquin the Elder — became Rome’s fifth king.
L. Tarquinius Priscus: The Engineer (r. 616–579 BC)
Scurrilous accession aside, Tarquin oversaw a period of necessary construction, military success, and effective reform in the Eternal City. Though often overtowered by the whirlwind of reforms wrought by Servius Tullius, his successor, Tarquinius Priscus’ fruitful reign ought not be overlooked.
Many of his engineering projects became the defining monuments of Rome. He built the Circus Maximus (a chariot-racing arena) at the base of the Palatine hill; he laid the foundation for the Temple of Iuppiter Optimus Maximus (the High God of the Roman pantheon) on the Capitoline hill, to be completed by his son; and he constructed a massive sewer, the cloaca maxima, to drain the swamp between the Palatine and Capitoline hills, which would later become the site of the famous Roman Forum. He also continued the construction of walled defenses around the entire city.
On the military front, Tarquin initiated a war against the neighboring Latins, seizing the town of Apiolae and a great deal of booty, instituting annual games as celebration. (He would go on to take and assimilate additional Latin cities in subsequent offensives.) He then weathered an Etruscan-supported Sabine assault with exceptional difficulty — fighting spilled into the streets of Rome, and the Sabines were only barely repelled. Following an initial surprise attack that inflicted heavy losses, the Sabines withdrew to prepare for another offensive. Livy recounts the dramatic second skirmish (Ab Urbe Condita I.37, tr. Aubrey de Sélincourt — an edition from the Heritage Club that I heartily recommend):
Hostilities with the Sabines were now resumed. The striking-power of Rome had been increased by the expansion of the cavalry [which Tarquin had completed during the Sabine respite], but in what followed it was a strategy that played the decisive part. A stack of dry timber which had been lying on the bank of the Anio was set alight and the blazing logs thrown into the water. A good wind kept them burning, and many were carried down by the stream and became lodged amongst the piles of the bridge, which they set on fire. This was alarming enough for the Sabines while they were fighting, but worse when their resistance broke; for the burning bridge prevented their retreat, and large numbers of them escaped the enemy only to perish in the river. Their equipment floated down the Tiber to Rome, where it was recognized for what it was and brought the news of victory almost before a messenger could get through.
As terms of the parley that followed, Rome received the Sabine town of Collatia, in which Tarquin placed his nephew Egerius as commander of the Roman garrison. Following the victory over the Sabines, Tarquin celebrated a triumph, or general’s victory parade, on September 13, 585 BC. However, this conflict poked the Etruscan bear, for they had supported the Sabine effort; twelve Etruscan cities banded together and seized a Roman outpost at Fidenae, a town to the north of the city. This seizure kicked off a bloody conflict that saw Tarquin lead the Romans against his native civilization. Rome was victorious, subjugating the truculent Etruscan cities and gaining great wealth.
Tarquin’s remarkable successes carried over into the social and political realms. To stave off the Sabines (see above), he had expanded the number of cavalry centuries from three to six — thus doubling the size of the equites, or knight class. He increased the Senate by one hundred members — importantly, among whom was a man from the gens Octavii, the family of Rome’s first emperor 600 years later. He introduced many Etruscan military, political, and religious rites that later became hallmarks of Roman rule.
Tarquin went as he came, surrounded by divine phenomena and urged on by his ambitious wife. I leave it to Ragan to report the strange story (Survey):
A very unusual event occurred one night in the royal nursery. The woman watching the sleeping children (both royal and household children were there) screamed when the hair of one of the children, a slave-woman’s [Ocrisia’s] son, seemed to be on fire. This brought Queen Tanaquil who, when she saw that the fire was not harming the child, took this as a sign of destiny for the child. She convinced her husband that the child, Servius Tullius, was thus designated by the gods to succeed to the throne. Some years later, Tarquin’s earlier treachery against Ancus’ sons caught up with him. One day, as the king was giving audience to citizens, a foreigner asked to speak to the king in private, on a matter of great importance. The king agreed and, when alone, the man (hired by Ancus’ exiled sons) took an ax to the king’s head and escaped. Tanaquil, wanting to secure the succession for Servius, carefully managed the situation as the king lay dying. She would give out daily reports about this recovery — knowing full well he was dead — all the while securing the support she would need to gain the kingship for Servius. This done, the death of Tarquin was divulged, and Servius Tullius, formerly the son of a slave, became the sixth king of the Romans.
And so Servius Tullius, once a slave boy, took power at Rome.
Servius Tullius: The Slave (r. 578–535 BC)
Servius was a king who knew his origins — his allegiances lay with the Plebs, the people, rather than with the aristocratic Patricians and noble families of the old order, to whom he seemed a mere “populist demagogue” (Ragan, Survey). Indeed, throughout the reigns of Servius and his successor, Tarquin the Proud, the Roman citizenry came into its own, earning participation in government and power in administration. Perhaps, though, the collapse of the old order brought the state down with it — the excesses and exiguities, triumphs and trivialities, virtues and vices of the Roman Kingdom crumbled under Tarquin the Proud. But all that is to come.
Servius’ great triumphs were social. In a reform known today as the Servian Constitution, he organized the Roman citizenry into five classes according to wealth, rather than to birth. The specific mechanism of this system — divided according to the armor each man could afford in wartime — relieved the poorest of their military duties. To accomplish this feat, he instituted the first census, or counting of Rome’s citizens and property, overseen by a censor. This division resulted in the Comitia Centuriata (the Centuriate Assembly), a body consisting of 193 “centuries” into which all Romans were sorted. However, while theoretically granting the Plebeians a voice in governance and law, the Comitia Centuriata did little to ease the Patrician [moneyed elite] chokehold on Roman administration — 180 of the 193 centuries consisted of the wealthiest estates, granting 5% of the Roman populace deciding power in all matters of state. (This unbalanced representation was accomplished by a crafty grouping of the classes: While the lowest estates had hundreds or even thousands of members, the highest ones had very few — think of a radical version of the U.S. electoral college.)
Though seemingly unbalanced, this division aptly reflected the contribution each class made to the Roman military: The highest classes were expected to contribute vast funds and troops to the city’s military endeavors, while the lowest ones contributed nothing at all. A democracy? No. But an accurate reflection of the relative weight and import of military matters in ancient societies? Yes. Before we leer at this classist system with a modern eye, perhaps we ought to recall Burke: “A true natural aristocracy is not a separate interest in the state, or separable from it. It is an essential integrant part of any large body rightly constituted. It is formed out of a class of legitimate presumptions, which taken as generalities, must be admitted for actual truths.” Political philosophy aside, Servius’ reforms laid the political, legal, social, and ideological bases for the Roman Republic to come.
​Class questions aside, the developments under Servius extended beyond his Constitution. Legend has it — though an archaeologist perhaps doesn’t— that he constructed the Servian Wall, enclosing 608 acres and all seven of the famous hills of Rome (Servius had expanded the city onto the Quirinal, Viminal, and Equiline). For the pauper, he was a prince: He eliminated debt imprisonment and eased the tax burden on the lowest classes, albeit in exchange for a paucity of political representation (see above). Furthermore, he entrusted the precariat to its land, labor, and liberty, dividing public land and letting the poor farm and tend to themselves. He divided the people of Rome into four tribes and the entire country into thirty one. He founded a very important shrine to Diana on the Aventine Hill, a shrine that became the administrative center of a critical alliance between Rome and the Latin League (an alliance of neighboring tribes and communities aligned against Roman expansion). For the first time, Servius energetically delineated the bounds of citizenship: His Constitutional ukase placed freedmen within his classes, thus enfranchising former slaves and bolstering the citizen base. Additionally, Servius established several religious festivals, most notably the Compitalia (celebrated in early January each year).
Before we recount the pitiable end of old Servius, let us recap Rome’s status at the end of his reign. Rome had expanded territorially, occupying all Seven of the famous Hills. Her citizenry was divided by wealth, not birth. The Servian Constitution had laid the basis for the Republic that was soon to come. Rome’s geopolitical situation was strong, with alliances secured with the Latin League and the Etruscans. Freedman and poor alike were newly protected and empowered.
Alas, Servius’ humble origins returned to haunt him. I once again defer to Ragan to recount the death of Servius and the ascendency of his successor, Tarquin the Proud (Survey):
Servius’ origin, however, continued to plague him as the Roman aristocracy felt demeaned, being ruled by a former slave. Thus, Servius Tullius married his two daughters, both named Tullia, to two sons (or grandsons) of the former King Tarquin [Tarquinius Priscus]: Tarquin (called Superbus, “the proud, arrogant”) and the younger Arruns. That Servius knew the characters of his daughters and his sons-in-law is shown by his matching. Tullia the Younger, married to Arruns, was as ambitious and conniving as her true love, the man she most admired, Arruns’ younger brother; Tullia the Elder, a devoted, if simple, wife was utterly unlike her conniving, ambitious husband. [i.e the ambitious and conniving Tullia the Younger was married to the simple and devoted Arruns; the simple and devoted Tullia the Elder was married to the ambitious and conniving Tarquinius Superbus. Tullia the Elder pined for Tarquinius Superbus (and vice versa), and was bound to get her way, a marriage from Dante’s Hell; trouble stewed in each couple’s nuptial hours.] Livy puts it rather succinctly: “Two deaths soon followed,” and the surviving Tullia and Tarquin joined in marriage and conspiracy. Working long behind the scenes, when Tarquin decided it was time to act, he boldly went into the Forum to the Curia (Senate House), sat on the royal throne, and proclaimed himself king before the shocked populace. Tullia shamelessly appeared in public and, from her carriage, heralded her husband’s usurpation. Hearing the clamor, old Servius came into the Forum (the Regia, or royal palace, was nearby) and attempted to resist Tarquin. The younger man hurled his father-in-law down the steps and, as he was led home, wounded, sent assassins to finish him off! Livy adds a gruesome touch: As she was coming home in her carriage, Tullia saw the body of her father deserted in the street. She ordered her driver to drive over the body, splattering the carriage with blood, and taking the curse home. The street where this happened was called thereafter Via Scelerata, Street of Crime.
Scandal, shock, scurrility — these were the accoutrements of Tarquinius Superbus’ accession. Where Tarquinius Priscus had pomp and pageantry, Superbus had profligacy and perfidy; where old Numa had decorum and decency, Superbus had depravity and debasedness; and where Romulus had valor and vigor, Superbus had vanity and villainy. The blood splattered on the wheels of Tullia’s cabriolet betokened more than the death of a helpless elder; it presaged the end of a mighty chapter in Rome’s history. The tale of Tarquin the Proud is one of crime for all ages.
Tarquinius Superbus: The Tyrant (r. 535–509 BC)
And so we come to Tarquin the Proud, as all histories of the Roman Kingdom must, the final king of the great house of Tarquin. His cognomen, “Superbus,” (translated as “proud” or “arrogant”) tells all. Ragan aptly characterizes his rule: “That bloody and inauspicious act was only the beginning to what became a despot’s reign of terror. As is the case with all tyrants, no class or individual was spared from Tarquin’s jealousy or cruelty” (Survey). Indeed, so wretched was the rule of Tarquin that he made the title of rex, or king, forever hateful to the Romans, inscribing his name with blood on the tapestry of Roman descent. As Cicero questioned in his Republica, “Are you not aware that it was the insolence and pride of one man, Tarquinius, that made the title of king odious to our people?”
Ambition, wealth, and disregard make a vile combination; Tarquin began his reign with a murderous romp. He refused to entomb old Servius, and executed any senator whom he deemed a “loyalist” supporter of Servius, seizing their property for his own and reducing the size of the Senate. He mustered a bodyguard to facilitate his haughty uninhibitedness. Livy captures his philosophy on governance: “Without hope of his subjects’ affection, he could rule only by fear; and to make himself feared as widely as possible he began the practice of trying capital causes without consultation and by his own sole authority” (Early History of Rome). He ruled as a tyrant rather than as a king, refusing to consult the Senate on any matters of military or state. His proto-Machiavellian foreign policy was just as brutal, as when he summoned a meeting of local leaders and proceeded to execute one (by drowning him to death, no less) under a manufactured charge, a blatant violation of Rome’s notions of justified foreign aggression. He used mercenaries for matters of war, a massive faux-pas in the Roman eye. One particular event recalls his military cruelty, the famous skirmish with Gabii (Ragan, Survey):
Unable to defeat the town of Gabii in battle, Tarquin contrived to have his son pretend that he was fleeing his cruel father — something easily believed. Established in Gabii, Sextus secretly sent to his father asking what to do next. While the messenger awaited, Tarquin silently went into his garden and with his walking stick lopped off the heads of flowers that towered above others. This “object lesson” was not lost on the son; many noble heads were lopped off, and Sextus gained power in Gabii only to hand it over to his father.
In religious matters Tarquin the Proud was equally inept. When the Cumaean Sibyl, a priestess of Apollo, came to Tarquin to offer him nine books of prophecy about the future of Rome (albeit for a hefty sum), he declined. The Sibyl, a crafty saleswoman (who knew!), burned three of the scrolls, and offered the six left for the original price. Tarquin yet again refused — and yet again the Sibyl set three alight, leaving only three from the original nine. Finally, Tarquin paid six thousand talents of silver — an exorbitant sum (about $99 million in today’s prices!) — for a third of the original offering. These books, which came to be known as the Sibylline Books, were housed in the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus and were consulted by the Roman Senate during national emergencies.
Despite its many disasters, the reign of Tarquin the Proud had one area of success: infrastructure. Tarquin, though deranged, understood the mind of the Roman populace; when kept busy, the people had little time to foment discontent. Accordingly, he imported Etruscan engineers and began several massive and lavish construction projects: the Temple of Jupiter and the excavation of the Cloaca Maxima, in particular. Ironically, however, it was the very area in which Tarquin found limited success that effected his downfall: His incredible infrastructure expenditure left the Roman coffers depleted and himself in need of more funds. And so he laid siege to the rich town of Ardea. I once again turn to Ragan for the downfall that followed (Survey):
The end of the Tarquins, and of monarchy at Rome, occurred with a tragic element. Away at a local siege [at Ardea], some young officers, including the king’s son, Sextus, his cousin Tarquinius Collatinus, and a friend, the (supposed) fool Lucius Junius Brutus (his name means “dull”), were one night discussing their wives. Whereas the other men bragged about their wives’ beauty and love of luxury, Collatinus spoke of his wife Lucretia’s great beauty, faithfulness, and diligence in keeping the house — at all hours. Finding this claim hard to imagine, the young men headed back to Rome late at night to find the situation exactly as Collatinus had asserted. Sextus was deeply struck with lust for the beautiful and noble woman. He later returned secretly with a sword to force her to lie with him. When at first she refused, preferring death to dishonor, he threatened further to kill her and leave a dead slave in bed with her. Rather than face public disgrace on herself and her family, the noble woman submitted to her shame. Some time later, overcome with remorse, she confessed the crime to her husband, Brutus, and others [including her father, Spurius Lucius Tricipitinus]. The horror related, she committed suicide in their presence. Aroused to mutiny by such an outrage, Brutus threw off the mask of foolishness he had cultivated to survive under a tyrant, and with many nobles, roused the senate and people against the Tarquins. The king was with the army; when he returned, demanding to be admitted to Rome, the gates were shut in his face, his property was confiscated, and the Tarquins were banished forever. Curiously, Sextus sought refuge in Gabii, where he met a just fate by the people he had betrayed. The exiled Tarquin sought the help of the Etruscan king Lars Porsenna to restore his throne. Failing in his attempt, Tarquin died in exile some ten years later.
And so the Roman Kingdom began and ended with rape: It initiated 241 years prior with the Rape of the Sabine Women, the famous snatching that furnished the hooligan hillpeople known as Romans with women, and it concluded with the famous Rape of Lucretia. Rome was now to be a Republic, ruled by two annually elected magistrates known as consuls.
Thus we conclude our fourth chapter of Roman history. The year is 509 BC, 244 years after her founding in 753, and Rome has entered a new era, the Republic, with two emergent leaders at her helm.

The problem is well-known enough to be a cliche: ancient history is exclusively focused on the lives and perspectives of aristocratic men. Sorting through this bias to recover the stories of other types of people — whether they be lower-class, enslaved, or in my case, female — is an inexact art. But allow me to try it for you. Here are 8 ancient Roman women you should know from history.
A word of caution before I begin: I am using Roman histories and literature here, not archaeological evidence or other ways we have of knowing about the Romans. That means I am filtering through the biases of aristocratic male writers. To the ancient Romans composing the histories, women could be roughly filtered into two categories: good women (wives and mothers who devote their entire beings to the benefit of the interests of their husbands, sons, fathers, etc.) and troublesome women (women who dare to become famous in their own right, and thus must have Something Wrong With Them). A troublesome woman was assumed to fit a certain stereotype: she was a conniving woman trying to use the powerful men in her life to her own ends; she did not observe the proper sexual boundaries (adultery, but also often incest); she killed men with poison (the woman’s murder method as it involved sneaking around and no face-to-face violence). Some of the women on this list will fit the Roman “good woman” mold, but most will be troublesome ones. So Roman writers — already notorious for their problematic relationship with facts — frequently reported rumors as fact or outright lied to make these women fit their stereotype better. Take everything you read about these women (including in this article!) with a healthy grain of salt.
It’s the middle of the second century BCE. New wealth has been pouring into Rome from its recent conquests, from Spain to Carthage to Greece, and tastes among aristocrats are shifting accordingly. The ruling class of Rome used to pride itself on austerity, dressing plainly and maintaining simple lifestyles. But an abundance of foreign gold has tempted the aristocracy into gaudy, Eastern-style displays of wealth. Fine fabrics, gold, and jewels are everywhere.
Cornelia, the daughter of Scipio Africanus (the general whose conquests helped generate all this wealth), is entertaining a friend at home. The friend has just been showing off her jewels to Cornelia, then asks, “What about you? Where are your jewels?”
Cornelia, who is dressed simply despite her wealth, summons her two young sons, Tiberius and Gaius. She smiles serenely as she displays her sons to her friend: “These are my jewels,” Cornelia says.
Cornelia was a paragon of virtue, an example to all Roman women of correct matronly behavior. She was well educated in both Latin and Greek. She was an accomplished writer: she published a set of her letters that were apparently widely read and studied by girls wishing to be as good as her. (These writings, unfortunately and predictably, are long lost.) She was devoted to her sons and remained faithful to her husband even after his early death: Cornelia was an univira, a woman who had had only one husband. She even turned down a marriage proposal from the king of Egypt. (Remarriage after widowhood or divorce was widely accepted and even encouraged, but the Romans reserved a special reverence for a woman who refused it — an univira showed a restraint and devotion to her deceased husband that surpassed even social expectations.)
As I mentioned, Cornelia was the daughter of Scipio Africanus, the vanquisher of Hannibal, who was undoubtably the most important Roman of his age and certainly one of the most consequential in all Roman history. But Cornelia raised her sons with a mission: she wanted them to be so successful that she would be remembered more as their mother than as Scipio’s daughter. This came true, but not in the way she wanted.
Cornelia’s sons, Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus, were Rome’s first populist reformers in centuries. Tiberius became a tribune of the plebs (the voice of the common people) at a time that the office had lost its radical edge. Tiberius brought populist rhetoric back after centuries of aristocratic dominance, demanding land reform to benefit the poor. The aristocracy did not take kindly to the proposition and murdered Tiberius Gracchus. A decade later, his brother Gaius came back with an expanded list of demands and an illegal private army to defend him from his brother’s fate. It took longer, but the aristocracy brought in the actual army and Gaius Gracchus took his own life once his defeat was certain. But the aristocracy could not silence the demands the Gracchi had stirred up. The Gracchi mark the beginning of an era of popular unrest and frequent uprisings, a period that ends with the aristocracy destroying the republic and establishing autocracy. They begin a violent epoch in Roman history that changes the very fabric of Rome.
If Cornelia had any aristocratic reservations about her sons’ political careers, we don’t know it: in public, Cornelia was an energetic supporter of her sons. Remember that, in the Roman view, a good woman supports the men of her family. By supporting her sons’ political ambitions even at the expense of her own social class, Cornelia again shows the Roman ideal of womanhood. Even her own ambition — to be more famous for her sons than for her father — shows the proper sort of ambition for a woman: desire not for her own elevation, but for the success of her menfolk.
Cornelia was both an old-fashioned scion of idealized Roman matronhood and an unusually learned and accomplished woman. She was highly respected in her own time and remains well remembered by history today.
It’s the first century BCE, and a more modern sort of woman is in vogue. The docta puella (“educated girl”) is more independent: she’s witty and worldly, she mingles with poets and philosophers as an equal, she takes lovers without shame. Men write about her love as a revelation, her rejection as the worst imaginable calamity. The docta puella holds a power that is most unladylike.
The foremost of the early doctae puellae was Clodia Metelli. She was a daughter of a heavily distinguished household who became infamous for a pair of affairs: one with a poet who damned her as eagerly as he had praised her, and one with a politician that ended in an accusation of poisoning.
Clodia was descended from one of the noblest families in all of Rome, the gens Claudia — among other famous ancestors was Appius Claudius Caecus, who built the first aqueduct and the most important Roman road, the Via Appia. (Most of the women of the family would have been named Claudia, but Clodia used an alternate spelling of the name that was briefly fashionable in her time.) She was married to Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer, an aristocratic optimate. But when her brother, the infamous populist rabble-rouser Clodius Pulcher, came into political conflict with Metellus Celer, Clodia publicly supported her brother over her husband. This might seem surprising, but though it was mildly scandalous, it was also seen as typical at the time: marriage ties were weaker than ties to natal families, and many Roman women supported brothers and fathers over their husbands.
We can’t know for sure, but we are pretty sure that Clodia was the lover of the poet Catullus whom he called “Lesbia” in his poems. His poetry is the only evidence we have of their relationship, and we can safely say that Catullus’s poetry prioritizes melodrama over factual accuracy. Still, the outlines of the relationship are clear: Catullus was a young upstart poet, Clodia an established, fashionable socialite. He followed her like a puppy, and she kept him around as long as he amused her, then discarded him in favor of other lovers. In a series of poems, Catullus bitterly attacks Clodia and the men he suspects of being her lovers until one begins to wonder what Clodia ever saw in him.
We are certain that Clodia had an affair with Marcus Caelius Rufus, an orator and up-and-coming politician younger than she was. Their relationship ended, and Caelius made his way firmly into political circles that opposed Clodia’s, so in 56 BCE Clodia accused Caelius of trying to poison her at the end of their relationship. Her motivation was political, to tank Caelius’s career and harm his allies — whether there was a grain of truth to the poisoning story is unknowable, but either way, her aim was political, not personal.
In the trial for the alleged poisoning, one of the members of Caelius’s defense team was Cicero, widely considered the greatest of all Roman orators and a longtime political opponent of Clodia’s brother Clodius Pulcher. Each member of the defense team had his own job, and Cicero’s was solely to shred Clodia’s credibility. This tactic would not be allowed in a modern courtroom, but in a Roman one it was fair game. Cicero would augment his colleagues’ claims of Caelius’s innocence with claims of Clodia’s debauchery and wickedness of spirit.
Cicero’s speech (called the Pro Caelio) is a masterwork of invective, and a catalog of Roman insecurities about women in general and doctae puellae in particular. He depicts Clodia as an amoral seducer of younger lovers who bought a house overlooking a bathing spot so she could pick out her victims. He accuses her of poisoning her husband and of having sex with her brother, two ridiculous charges that he knows he can’t prove, so he brings them up through backhanded hints instead of directly. He even assumes the persona of her famous ancestor Appius Claudius to tell her how disappointed he is in her and how she is tarnishing her family’s reputation. It’s a brutal, no-holds-barred takedown. Clodia loses the trial.
Yet we get the smallest hint that Clodia and Cicero didn’t take this political feud personally. In a letter from well after the trial, Cicero mentions speaking with Clodia about buying some land from her. It’s such an offhand, casual mention that it seems that they were on perfectly normal speaking terms. It certainly shows that both continued to move in the same social circles even after the trial. Maybe they were even friendly. It is this detail more than any other that suggests Clodia as an equal to the men of her time: that, just like men in politics, she was perfectly capable of having vitriolic public clashes with someone, then meet them later at a party and leave it behind.
In the end, Clodia was a socialite. She mingled with the men of Rome’s aristocracy as an equal, had affairs at will, involved herself in drama both personal and political, and remained part of her social circles regardless. She was a renowned beauty, an occasional political operator, and the very model of the docta puella.

Clodius Pulcher, like the Gracchi before him, was a populist rabblerouser. He’d risen to power by orchestrating huge amounts of mob violence and had a loyal group of supporters who were about to drive him to higher and better offices. Unfortunately, he has just been undone by the very force that created him: his gang and one led by a rival named Milo clashed in the road just outside Rome, and Clodius has been murdered. It’s 52 BCE, and Rome is at a crossroads.
Clodius’s supporters have brought his body to his widow, Fulvia, who cries publicly in her doorway. According to ritual and tradition, these should be her next steps: Fulvia needs to have the body cleaned and dressed, then leave it lying in the atrium so visitors can pay their respects before the funeral. Then in a few days, she must gather the family for a funeral procession through the city, which will include representations of Clodius’s famous ancestors (of which he has very many — see the description of his sister Clodia’s family above). The procession will stop at the Forum, where a distinguished male family member or friend will give a funeral oration in her husband’s honor. Then all will proceed to the family tomb outside the city walls, where the body will be cremated and placed in an urn inside the mausoleum. This is the procedure, and though it can be fraught with emotion, it is orderly and time-honored.
Fulvia does not do this.
She allows Clodius’s supporters to take his body, still broken and mangled by the street fight that killed him, directly to the Forum. There they lay him on the Rostra and give his impromptu funeral oration — mere hours after his death instead of days — in a way that whips the common people into a frenzy at the loss of their hero. The mob takes Clodius’s body and decides to cremate it on the spot, but by tradition all crematoria are outside the city walls. So they use the Senate house instead. The Curia Hostilia, the senate’s meeting place for at least 500 years, burns to the ground.
It is a horrifying parody of a Roman funeral. Fulvia at least allowed it to happen, and quite likely encouraged it — it was the role of a good Roman wife to enhance the legacy of her husband, and Fulvia was consistently a funhouse-mirror version of the good Roman wife.
In the aftermath of Clodius’s funeral, Milo goes on trial for his murder, and even a court stacked with his allies knows better than to acquit him in the face of such popular unrest. Cicero doesn’t even risk giving the defense speech he’s written for the occasion. The burning of the Senate house was a message no one could ignore, and the Senate takes immediate steps to bring back stability. The march toward a civil war that will destroy the republic continues — and this isn’t the last role Fulvia will play in it.
Fulvia was married three times, all of her husbands ill-fated. Her first, Clodius, was the most successful populist politician in all of Roman history, until he very much wasn’t. Her second, Curio, had been a close ally of Clodius during his life and inherited Clodius’s supporters. Curio, however, didn’t have the reformist spirit of Clodius — he threw in his lot with Julius Caesar, and died in Africa during Caesar’s civil war. We hear nothing about Fulvia in this period. It is Fulvia’s third husband who will throw her back into the public spotlight almost a decade after Clodius’s death — another partisan of Caesar named Mark Antony.
In the aftermath of Caesar’s murder, Antony is one of few men in a position to try to seize his supporters and become the next Caesar. The next decade is chaos, with alliances and rivalries shifting constantly. Antony’s most consequential sometime-ally-sometime-rival is Octavian, the great-nephew and official heir of Caesar. Octavian is much younger than Antony and has no military experience while Antony is a seasoned and respected general. But Octavian has something Antony never does: he is an incredible propagandist.
Fulvia first enters Octavian’s propaganda by way of Cicero, who attacks Antony in a blistering set of speeches called the Philippics during a period of hostility between Antony and Octavian. As Clodius’s old enemy, Cicero can’t resist also attacking Fulvia, wife of Antony and widow of Clodius. He calls her a deadly thing that has destroyed both her previous husbands and is about to destroy her third. He simultaneously questions Antony’s morality by bringing up his many affairs and paints Fulvia as a controlling woman whom Antony slavishly obeys.
Fulvia’s response to Cicero’s attacks is emblematic of the actions of a Roman politician’s wife. Since Antony is away in the East and unable to respond, Fulvia circulates the city with Antony’s mother, meeting with senators and solidifying alliances that would protect her husband. Wives were the original lobbyists — prominent Roman men relied on their wives to set up their social calendars in ways that would further their careers, and when they were out of the city, their wives were among their most important advocates. Some accounts have Fulvia falling at the feet of senators and weeping to convince them to spare her husband. She is successful.
Soon, the rift between Antony and Octavian is brushed away in favor of a renewed alliance — and a proscription list. Proscription is a method of sanctioning political murders; Antony and Octavian offer rewards for killing their political enemies, then use the resources of the dead to fund their war on the conspirators who killed Caesar. Since Cicero attacked Antony, he makes it onto Antony’s list, and Octavian does not object. Cicero is murdered while fleeing the city. Many wish to see Fulvia’s hand in this murder: she exacts delayed revenge on behalf of her first husband Clodius (who had been Cicero’s staunchest opponent), and on her own behalf after Cicero dragged her name through the muck. But Cicero was at least as much Antony’s enemy as he was Fulvia’s, and the Philippics had been much crueler to him than to her. Still, the legend goes that Fulvia took out her hairpins and stabbed the tongue on Cicero’s severed head.
As I mentioned, Antony spent much of this period in the East, while Octavian kept firm control of Rome in the West. Fulvia stayed in Rome, putting her (again) in the position of defending Antony’s interests in his absence — even as he infamously had very public affairs with a Cappadocian princess named Glaphyra, then with the Egyptian queen Cleopatra. Inevitably, Octavian turned against Antony again, and Antony dithered about his reply. But Fulvia felt no need to wait for him.
In 41 BCE, Fulvia allied with Antony’s brother, Lucius Antonius, to raise an army and oppose Octavian. She helped raise troops, an atypical role for a woman to play. But her involvement proved helpful to Octavian’s propaganda: he painted the rebellion as the work of Antony’s out-of-control wife, who was just jealous because her husband was sleeping with other women. He said Fulvia had strapped on a sword and armor and led troops herself (which she almost certainly did not do, to my everlasting disappointment, because I adore this image for all the same reasons Octavian hated it). It fit well with Cicero’s earlier characterization of Antony as weak and controlled by women, and would transfer well to Octavian’s later war against Antony and his lover Cleopatra. We still have to contend with Octavian’s exaggerated image of Fulvia when we consider her, because his messaging was very successful — it has made a larger impact on history than Fulvia herself ever did. Octavian’s soldiers even inscribed sling bullets with sexual insults aimed at Fulvia before lobbing them at her and Lucius’s troops — in the propaganda war, this battle was Octavian vs. Fulvia, not Octavian vs. Lucius Antonius or Antony himself.
Lucius Antonius and Fulvia lost their battle in the Italian town of Perusia. (The incident would be called the Perusine War after this town.) Mark Antony disavowed the entire incident, and Octavian viewed his shaky alliance as worth maintaining, so he exiled Lucius and Fulvia instead of having them executed. Fulvia went to Athens to reunite briefly with Antony, but she died of an illness not long afterward. She did not live to see Antony and Cleopatra become so close they might as well have been married, or their unsuccessful last stand in 31 BCE against Octavian, the future Emperor Augustus.
Fulvia’s legacy is complicated. She was certainly politically savvy and capable, but as much as she did not fear to flout convention, everything she did was in service of her husbands’ interests. Ultimately, there is much about her that is unknowable. Clodius and Antony were on the losing sides of their conflicts, so everything we know about her is filtered through a hostile lens; we can trust no surviving characterizations of her. This, I think, is one of Fulvia’s most fascinating aspects: we know what she did, but nothing about what she thought or how she was. Though she is often held up as the quintessential Roman troublesome woman, the real Fulvia is an enigma.
Hortensia was a female orator who spoke against a plan by the Second Triumvirate to tax noblewomen. We don’t know much about her aside from this one act, but she won great respect in oratory, a domain the Romans considered male-only.
Hortensia was the daughter of Quintus Hortensius, an illustrious orator and rival to Cicero. The backdrop for Hortensia’s speech was the civil war that destroyed the Republic, the same one that Fulvia participated in. After decades of fighting, the war chests were growing empty. Octavian, Mark Antony, and Lepidus, the Second Triumvirate, proscribed their political rivals to raise money through their wealth (the proscription list that killed Cicero), but even that wasn’t enough. So in 42 BCE, they came up with a plan to tax the 1,400 wealthiest women in Rome.
Laws targeting women in wartime had a history in Rome: during the Second Punic War two centuries earlier, huge defeats by Hannibal led to the Lex Oppia, which limited women’s wealth. The justification was that wealthy men had to contribute to war by fighting, so wealthy women had to pull their weight by paying. In the case of the Lex Oppia, there was also an unstated reason: anxiety over women holding the wealth of Roman society. The Roman aristocracy had been gutted by the disastrous victories of Hannibal of Carthage. For the first time, huge numbers of widows were inheriting their husbands’ estates. Roman moralists panicked, and the senate acted to “protect” the fortunes of the great families from capricious women.
In the case of the Triumvirate’s proposal, the motivation was political: just as in the Punic War, the wealthy women who would be taxed were widows. Most of the widows of the aristocracy were produced by their husbands’ deaths in the civil wars — thus, taxing widows was a way of draining their political enemies’ funds posthumously.
A group of noblewomen led by Hortensia appeared before the Triumvirate to argue the injustice of the proposed tax. No authentic account of her speech survives. The Greek historian Appian, writing a century later, presents a version of her speech produced by his own imagination — this speech includes the jarringly modern argument that women were being taxed for a war that they had no say in, because they could not vote or hold public office. In other words, an ancient Roman (Greek?) version of a suffrage argument, or perhaps no taxation without representation. What the real Hortensia said is a mystery, but we hear glowing reviews from various ancient writers who did have access to the text. She was said to have resurrected the oratorical greatness of her father.
The Triumvirate tried to usher the women off the speaker’s platform, but the crowd rebelled. In the end, they reduced the list of women to be taxed to 400 and looked for other sources of revenue. Hortensia’s speech was a partial success.
Hortensia’s story isn’t as extensive as some of the other women’s on this list, but she was certainly a woman who took ownership of an issue. She stepped out of the traditional woman’s role in Rome and into the spotlight of politics, however briefly — and unlike of the most women who did so, she won respect instead of condemnation.
Sulpicia is a true rarity: a female Roman poet. We know of a few poetesses from Roman times (one of whom, hilariously, is a Silver Age poet also named Sulpicia). But only the Sulpicia of the first century CE has a body of poems still in existence today. So what can our lone surviving female Roman poet tell us?
Sulpicia was a docta puella from a literary family: her grandfather was Servius Sulpicius Rufus, whom Cicero called the greatest orator he’d ever heard, and the uncle who raised her was the literary patron who launched the career of Ovid. It’s no surprise she became a writer. Her oeuvre is short, six poems totaling 40 lines together. Her complete collected works fit comfortably on one sheet of paper. They are elegiac poems, a Roman genre of passionate poems addressed to (usually fickle) lovers. She writes about a pseudonymous lover named Cerinthus — her love for him, and the pain caused by both of their missteps and by other people pulling them apart. She takes on the voice of an emotional teenage girl, pouting at her uncle as he plans an inconvenient family trip, cursing herself for missteps in communication with her lover, and wrestling with questions about her identity and place in society.
For centuries, Sulpicia’s poems were not recognized as hers. They were preserved in a manuscript of Tibullus and assumed to be his. Scholarship showed her authorship in the 1800s, but for the next century, she was regarded only as a curiosity. Scholars said her poems lacked refinement, that she was a passionate, emotional amateur who didn’t merit serious study. (Gee, I wonder if her gender had anything to do with these assessments.) Only in the 1970s did scholars start to take a closer look, strip away the prejudices of the past, and begin to appreciate the talent and erudition underlying Sulpicia’s poetry.
But even if those old-fashioned scholars had been right about her, Sulpicia would still offer us something no other Roman poet can. Much Roman ink was spilled writing about men chasing after doctae puellae, but in Sulpicia’s case, the docta puella herself speaks. She has much to say about identity and social respectability from a woman’s viewpoint. Although Sulpicia’s work is not extensive and does not touch on many of the subjects we would love to know about through her eyes, still, she is an authentic female Roman voice — one of very few we still have access to — and thus can help us make up for some of the bothersome blind spots in our study of the Roman experience.

Livia Drusilla was the wife of Augustus and first empress of Rome — it can be fairly said that she set the expectations for all empresses after her. She was a close advisor and confidant of the emperor and was thus heavily involved in politics. But unlike Fulvia, she kept herself rigidly within the acceptable social boundaries set for Roman women, so her public image during her lifetime was much more positive. After her death, however, it turns out that no amount of piety can satisfy the writers of history, because she gets accused of being a conniving murderer in equal measure with her more scandalous peers.
Livia was the third wife of Augustus (the former Octavian), but seems to have been the first one he married for love rather than alliance-building. They were both married to other people when they met, and Augustus was immediately smitten. He divorced his wife Scribonia on the same day she gave birth to their daughter, and compelled Livia’s husband, Tiberius Claudius Nero, to divorce her even though she was six months pregnant with their second child. Augustus and Livia married immediately, and Livia’s ex-husband gave her away at the wedding ceremony as if he were the father of the bride. This was in 38 BCE, after the future Augustus defeated Fulvia at Perusia but before he defeated Antony and Cleopatra.
Augustus and Livia then had a happy 51-year marriage. Livia was just as careful in presenting her public image as her husband always was: she was depicted consistently as a chaste, modest, religiously reverent matron. She never produced children for him (their only pregnancy ended in stillbirth), which many Roman men would have responded to with divorce. But Augustus’s affection for Livia never seemed to diminish. According to Suetonius, Augustus kept notes throughout the day of things he meant to tell her so he wouldn’t forget anything when he saw her (which is the hardest I have ever liked or related to that slimy bastard).
It is ironic that Livia never had children with Augustus, because Augustus passed a slate of morality laws to reward women for childbearing in an effort to improve the aristocratic birthrate. The era of Augustus is a time of re-traditionalizing after the time of the docta puella — adultery was criminalized, and women were granted certain civil rights as long as they had enough children. The Roman nobility pulled its wives and daughters back out of the public eye, and Augustus led the charge. His wife was presented as the ideal matron in public. The fact that she filled this role for him without giving him an heir is a testament that their love was real and important to him.
Still, Livia was accused by later historians of engineering the deaths of Augustus’s relatives — and even of poisoning Augustus himself — in order that her own son might become his heir. It is true that Augustus lost a lot of heirs before reluctantly adopting Livia’s son by her first husband, who became the second emperor, Tiberius. But modern historians reject the idea that this was Livia’s doing. It’s a bit of slander that doesn’t fit well with everything else we know about her, especially the fact that she was never as close to her son Tiberius as she was to her husband. If you’re looking for an empress willing to murder her husband for the advancement of her son, look further down the list — Livia’s not your girl, but Agrippina is on her way.
After Augustus’s death of natural causes (no poison needed), Livia retained enormous influence as Augusta, the widow of a god. She clashed with her son, who had no desire to share power with his mother. Even as her real influence dwindled, she enjoyed the ceremony and honor her status afforded her. She died in 29 CE, 15 years after her husband, and her son Tiberius vetoed the order Augustus had left behind that Livia be deified upon her death. 13 years later, her grandson, the fourth emperor Claudius, restored all her honors and made her a god, Diva Augusta.
The age of Augustus brought a re-traditionalizing of Roman womanhood after the age of the docta puella, and Livia Drusilla was the posterchild of the proper imperial matron. Her marriage is a rare case of a happy marriage in the imperial household, and she garnered enough public respect to be honored as a god after her death.
Agrippina was another empress, the wife of the fourth emperor Claudius and the mother of the fifth emperor Nero. Like Fulvia, Agrippina is depicted in ancient histories as a scheming woman intent on exercising power through powerful men — and unlike Fulvia, Agrippina seems to have deserved this reputation. Her story is a soap opera that involves the murder of her husband and her own murder by her son in some real Looney Tunes shenanigans.
Agrippina was a member of the Julio-Claudian family tree, which is impossibly full of cousin marriages and adoptions — she’s related to just about anyone you can name from this period. She was the daughter of Agrippina the Elder (the well-respected granddaughter of Augustus) and Germanicus (a beloved general who was Tiberius’s heir until his own untimely death). When Tiberius died in 37 CE, it was Agrippina’s brother Caligula who took over.
Caligula’s reign is infamous, as is his relationship with his three sisters — he was very close to them and heaped public honors on them. (Several ancient sources say that Caligula committed incest with his sisters, but this is just slander and not at all likely to be true.) The relationship soured when Caligula’s favorite sister, Drusilla, died. The other two sisters fell out of favor, and Agrippina became wrapped up in palace intrigue and possibly an assassination plot. She was forced to carry the ashes of her executed brother-in-law (an alleged co-conspirator) in his funeral procession, then was exiled from Rome.
After Caligula’s assassination a few years later, his uncle Claudius took the throne and invited his exiled relatives back. Claudius had a reputation as a weak man pushed around by freedmen and women, especially his wife, Messalina. After allegedly scheming to overthrow Claudius, Messalina was executed, and Claudius began to think about taking a new wife. He chose Agrippina (now a widow twice over with one son), possibly as a way to make peace between the feuding Julian and Claudian branches of the family. They had to get special permission from the senate to marry because Agrippina was Claudius’s niece — ick.
As empress, Agrippina exerted huge influence, pursuing and killing personal enemies and piling honors on herself and her son. She persuaded Claudius to adopt her son, who took the name Nero — bafflingly, this meant Claudius gave Nero precedence over his own son, Britannicus, who was a few years younger. But apparently Claudius began to get wise and to prepare to distance himself from Agrippina and Nero. So Agrippina enlisted the support of the palace poisoner, a woman named Locusta (“lobster”) — yes, the imperial palace was the sort of place to employ a poisoner. With Locusta’s help, Agrippina killed Claudius by poisoning his mushrooms at a feast. Her son Nero remained his heir.
When Nero took the throne in 54 CE, his mother Agrippina kept a tight leash on him. She put his praetorian commander Burrus and his tutor Seneca the Younger in charge and publicly honored herself as nearly a co-ruler. Nero began to rebel, so Agrippina signaled that she might start to favor Claudius’s son Britannicus as his replacement. In response, Nero poisoned Britannicus at dinner just as Agrippina had Claudius. Picture the scene: Britannicus takes a sip of his wine (Nero put the poison into the snow used to cool wine instead of the wine itself to evade the food tasters) and drops dead immediately (Locusta had advised a slow-acting poison, but Nero had insisted on a fast one that would be obvious). His mother and all his advisers know what he has just done, but Nero says that Britannicus is only having an epileptic fit and will soon recover. The household is forced to finish their dinner with the teenager’s corpse still at the table. Nero wanted to deliver a message to his mother, and he certainly succeeded.
A few years of rising tensions later, Nero threw Agrippina out of the imperial palace. As he prepared to escape from under the thumb of the advisors she’d assigned him and start ruling for himself, he decided he should kill her too. So he offered her the use of one of his boats for a pleasure cruise to the resort town of Baiae. He had the boat rigged to sink, and had a trick awning built that could be triggered to fall on his mother and weigh her down to the deck so she couldn’t escape the sinking ship. Like I said in the introduction — Looney Tunes shenanigans. But Agrippina is the Roadrunner in this scenario: she wrestled her way free of the awning and swam to shore. Nero decided the time for subtlety was over and simply sent soldiers to her house to murder her.
Agrippina was a cunning, ambitious woman with the same lack of scruples as the men in her family. She was the great-granddaughter, adopted granddaughter, sister, wife, and mother respectively of the five Julio-Claudian emperors. She murdered her husband with poisoned mushrooms only to be murdered in turn by the son she’d put on the throne — no one can say she didn’t know the game she was playing.
There are many empresses who came after Agrippina and similarly played political games as wives and mothers, most notably the many Julias of the Severan Dynasty — perhaps if I ever write a sequel to this article, I’ll cover them. For now, I’d like to take you forward a few centuries…
Honoria was an empress of sorts in the early 5th century CE, just before the fall of the western empire — and indeed there is an old-fashioned tradition of blaming her for the Fall of Rome itself. The Rome Honoria inhabited was very different from the Rome of all the other women on this list; one might even consider it an entirely separate society. But the woman who couldn’t follow a vow of chastity so hard she might have sent a marriage proposal to Attila the Hun about it certainly deserves a spot on this list.
Honoria was the daughter of short-lived emperor Constantius III and Galla Placidia, another woman who merits discussion. Placidia, the sister of emperor Honorius, was taken as a prisoner of war in the 410 CE sack of Rome by the Visigoths. When relations improved between the Goths and Honorius, the Gothic leader Ataulf married Placidia in 414 to cement a Romano-Gothic alliance. But relations soured again, and after her Gothic husband’s overthrow, Placidia returned to Rome as part of a peace treaty, where her brother married her off to a general who later became his co-emperor Constantius III.
Placidia had three children, including Honoria, who would have been a young child for much of what followed: Placidia’s husband Constantius III died, Placidia fell out with Emperor Honorius, and the family fled to Constantinople. A few short years later Honorius died, leaving a power vacuum in Rome, and Placidia and her children returned to join the dynastic struggle. In 425 CE, Placidia had her young son set up as the emperor Valententian III, and she became his regent, as no one expected a five-year-old to rule. Placidia held effective power as Augusta for the next 25 years.
Placidia gave the title Augusta to her daughter, presumably so she could help as regent if Placidia herself became unable for any reason. But centuries of dynastic struggle made late imperial households take some extreme measures: as Augusta, Honoria had to take a vow of chastity so that she wouldn’t produce any heirs to challenge the legitimacy of her emperor brother. She found this difficult when she matured, and became pregnant by a palace official. (Honoria’s chronology isn’t easy to pin down, but I think she was in her 20s or 30s at this point.) Her mother took away her title, executed her lover, and had her engaged to a middling senator with no ambition as a way of disarming her.
Stripped of power and prestige, Honoria chafed. She had been raised by a powerful imperial woman and expected the same life for herself. And so in 449 CE, Honoria sent a request for help — along with her engagement ring — to Attila the Hun. She offered him the western empire if he would extract her from her terrible engagement.
The infamous Attila had been threatening both halves of the Roman empire for some years now, but had not yet dared to make an all-out attack. Now he had received a plea and a ring from the sister of the western emperor — whether Honoria had actually meant her gesture as a marriage proposal is unclear, but Attila chose to interpret it that way, seizing on her request for help as a pretense to invade and a marriage alliance as a possible way to hang onto Rome once he took it. He announced his intention to march on Rome and claim his bride.
Emperor Valentinian III exiled his sister Honoria — only the influence of their mother Galla Placidia stopped him from executing her — and had to fight the Huns in Italy in the early 450s. But Attila never took Rome or claimed his Roman bride. Though he won all his battles in Italy, external forces pulled him east again, and he died shortly thereafter.
Nothing is known of Honoria’s life after this incident. There is some evidence to suggest that she was dead six years later, in 455, but we cannot be sure — she either died young or disappeared into obscurity.
Historians looking for a sensational story have sometimes pointed to Honoria inviting Attila the Hun to attack Rome as the cause of the final fall of the west, but the connection between those events is tenuous at best. That would imply that Attila was a primary cause of the fall, which is not a very solid argument. Attila, and by extension Honoria, merely contributed to the chaos swallowing the western empire at this time; they did not cause it.
Still, the story of an imperial woman so insulted at having been removed from power that she proposed an alliance (and possibly a marriage) with one of the most infamous so-called “barbarians” of all time to regain it… it’s a doozy, even if it didn’t actually destroy the empire. We can thank Honoria for one of the wildest, most soap-opera-like turns in late Roman history.
Socialites, schemers, pious wives, treacherous empresses — these eight women show a range of ways an upper-class woman could penetrate the male-centric bias of ancient historians and be recorded, however imperfectly, in their annals. My goal was to focus on Roman women who appear in the histories (with one sidebar into literature), which means this list is not intersectional: the lives of lower-class and slave women are more difficult to recover, though no less worthy of the effort.
These eight women represent a variety of ways in which women were received in their own time, from admiration to horror, from crediting them for making a difference to blaming them for the fall of society. A Roman woman was expected to support her family in public, but was routinely punished if she became too visible. The experience of being a woman was, perhaps, not as different from today as we might expect.
So tell me… which Roman women have I missed? Who should I cover in part 2?

“Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble Ancient footprints are everywhere You can almost think that you’re seein’ double On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs”- Bob Dylan, When I Paint My Masterpiece
How often do I think about the Roman Empire?
As a brown South Asian man, not much. I see the Roman Empire as a distant blip- a collection of bedtime stories featuring tales of valour, romance, betrayal, political intrigue, and war. However, when surrounded by the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, and the Colosseum, its hard not to think about the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire is inseparable from the life of the average present-day resident of Rome. The construction of the Rome Metro Line was repeatedly interrupted because every time they dug underground, they found Roman ruins. The average Italian’s regular Rome commute on the metro disobeys conventional underground train urban planning as it zigzags across the city to avoid running through Roman artifacts. The average Italian in Rome also disdains at the bumbling, clueless tourists who block the glorious Vespa’s right-of-way on the road. While the Roman Empire expanded outward from within like an amoeba conquering everything in its path, modern Rome is being conquered by tourists from without. And the reason for the tourist invasion? The gargantuan Roman artifacts that are interspersed with the average neighborhood in Rome. And of course, the food.
The word ‘romance’ comes from the old French word ‘romanz’ referring to the act of speaking in the old vernacular, more Latinized French. Romanz referred to a bygone era where Latin was the lingua franca during the Roman Empire. Stories written in the vernacular- or romanz- were action packed, chivalric, and medieval. Think Shrek, but less self-aware. These tales involved medieval knights setting off on Herculean adventures, slaying beasts, sparring with Barbarians, and winning a lucky maiden’s hand in marriage. These tales were a glimpse into the imagination of a person in the Middle Ages. It was a mythical adoration and idealization of a bygone Roman era which would be reminisced for centuries to come. The hero undertaking life threatening trials and tribulations to win the love of a beautiful maiden would- in this context- be romantic (i.e. imbued with the characteristics of a Roman). The ethos of Rome is giving Paris a serious run for its money in the title battle for The City of Love.
Another area where Rome gives Paris a run for its money is the food. We’ve all had a croissant- the flaky, soft package of buttery goodness that takes on a velvety texture when dipped in a cappuccino. The croissant is quintessentially French. Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite may well be the core values of the French Republic, but the word Croissant can be added to the end of that verbiage to include another aspect of what is core to being French. But what if I told you that there is a better alternative to the croissant- an alternative that we’ve all ignored over the last few centuries? Enter the cornetto, a larger, flakier, butter-ier, velvet-ier alternative to the croissant which comes filled with varieties of cream- usually, Pistachio, Chocolate or Custard. If you walk opposite to the direction of the teeming hoardes of tourists in Rome, you’ll come across local Pasticcerias- local pastry shops- selling cheap cornettos out of holes in walls. Italians line up around the block to collect their daily dose of cappuccino and cornetto right before their morning commute. The combination creates an essential fuel for today’s Roman, providing them with mental acuity and patience to tolerate bumbling tourists that block the roadways. One such hole-in-the-wall is the Roscioli Café Pasticceria- an iconic establishment that is always full, busy and teeming with Italians. One bite into Roscioli’s famous tent-pole pistachio cornetto expands the boundaries of what your mind thought was possible- the flaky, buttery, velvety soft texture of the cappuccino infused pastry is bombarded with the nutty, creamy, smooth, hearty textures of the pistachio crema. Now compare that with the croissant- a heap of flaky pastry that falls apart at the smallest touch. I will never see the croissant the same way again. The French have monopolized our consciousness and successfully convinced us of the superiority of their cuisine. Try one pistachio cornetto, and you’ll realize that a croissant is a middle-of-the-road bland husk of carbohydrates, or as the French like to say- merde.
Similar to the croissant, the pizza that you’ve been eating all your life is a lie. Pizza, once the pride of Italy, has been bastardized and appropriated by the Americans (as with all foods), and elevated to a sort of quintessentially American experience. The Pizza we eat today is what the American capitalist machine has forcefully shoved down our throats- a slab of chewy, overcooked dough, topped with excessively saucy and drippy tomaytuh sowuhss, complimented by an indistinguishable rapidly melting slop of mozzarella cheese made in a factory being operated by some poor bloke working minimum wage to mass produce a cheese purpose-built for the fastest melt rather than the best flavor. American pizza is not made with love, it’s made to suit the convenience of Americans- mass produced, characterless slop served quick and cheap, ready to reheat and eaten on the go in a Ford F-150. Italians take offense to the idea of New York Pizza. Even more offensive, are the Detroit Style and Chicago pizzas.
Romans have been consuming pizzas for centuries. Originated as a flat piece of dough topped with meat, vegetables and other accouterments during the Roman Empire, the pizza has mass appeal across cultures- take for example, the lahmacun in Turkey, the pide in the Levant, the mana’kish in the Gulf. The ancient recipe was simple- no frills, with no tomato sauce or melted cheese, providing for the best way for ancient Romans to gain energy on their long conquests, whilst maximizing flavor. Tomatoes eventually made their way into Italy in the 18th Century as a new world crop- “discovered” by Spanish conquistadors in their conquest of Latin America and brought back to Europe. And so began the tomato sauce fad. Look closely at regional pizza variations, and one will notice that pizzas in Naples almost entirely comprise a layer of tomato sauce on the dough. Meanwhile, Pizzas sold by decades old vendors in Rome include the original, sauce-less variations. While Naples does indisputably take credit for being the originator of the Pizza, there is an argument to be made that vendors in Rome remained true to the Pizza’s original tomato sauce-less form. One such Roman vendor is the famous Roscioli Antico Forno (different Roscioli this time).
Roscioli’s pizza, a very archetypal Roman kind- it’s flat, crispy, and served by the slice in rectangular form. Roscioli’s pizzas vary with the tomato sauce and non-sauce variations alike, producing variations that people travel across the world for. Their most popular pizza slice is the pizza bianca- or White Pizza. While the white pizzas sold at the large American chains usually replace tomato sauce with a regurgitated toxic sludge of a bechamel that fails to obey Newtonian fluid dynamics, Roscioli’s is without a sauce- leaving the white (or bianca) base exposed like a blank canvas ripe for culinary experimentation. Their dough- a treasured family secret- does all the heavy lifting. It’s crispy and flaky, whilst being flat with the right amount of give required for the perfect chew. Their variations include one that’s topped with potatoes, olive oil, salsiccia (Italian sausage) and rosemary creating a simple yet delicious slice that’s dripping with olive oil and can be eaten on-the-go. Another pizza variation famous in Rome, is the Pizza Marinara, reproduced best by another locally respected establishment- Pizza alla Palla.
Pizza alla Palla is tucked away into one of Rome’s back alleys within a quaint residential area. You will almost hear zero English spoken within a 500-metre radius of this establishment. It’s operating space is so tiny, that it can only fit 4 to 5 diners at once. The limited seating space is not a concern to their patrons, as the pizzas fly out from behind the counter in white paper bags to be quickly engorged on by a hungry Roman while they go on to conquer the Roman streets in their crusade against pedestrians and tourists. Pizza alla Palla’s pizzas- like most Roman pizza shops- lay behind a glass wall and are illuminated by bright yellow, fluorescent lights to contrast the bright reds of the sauce.
The Pizza Marinara, is a thought experiment on what Pizza would look like without cheese. While we’ve grown up eating cheesy pizza from American establishments our whole lives, the Romans have been eating Pizza without melted cheese for more than two centuries. Unlike with Roscioli, Pizza alla Palla’s pizza is carried by the sauce. My favourite variation on the marinara was a slice with anchovies, capers, olives and fresh burrata. The saltiness of the anchovies and olives when combined with the tartness of the capers and tomato sauce reinforce the hearty, fatty, and fresh burrata creating the ultimate flavour bomb that one can reminisce for years. If anchovies on pizza isn’t your cup of tea, then I suggest you go for local artisanal vendor Pizza Hut’s artful, hand-crafted, oven baked Pizza Margherita with a tomato sauce so generic that it may as well be copyrighted by Toronto based rapper Drake, accompanied by a cheese topping identical to a radioactive toxic sludge that makes Chernobyl look like a kiddie-pool.
Similar to Rome’s pizza, Rome’s pasta are quite unique and under-explored as well. The 4 pastas indigenous to Rome are: The Cacio E Pepe (Cheese and Pepper), Carbonara, Amatriciana and alla Gricia. What all these dishes have in common is the heavy-handed use of pepper to create nutty, mildly spicy notes to contrast with the fat of the cheese and guanciale (Pork jowl). Guanciale- a slab of fatty pork meat- is heavily used in the Carbonara, Amatriciana and alla Gricia and its fat often serves as a starting base for the sauces. Carbonara adds egg to this fat, Amatriciana adds tomato sauce and alla Gricia adds cheese, creating a holy trinity of Roman fat-based pasta sauces. The most common of these outside of Italy is the Carbonara, almost universally bastardized through the extra addition of cream, bacon and emulsifying agents. The universalization of American Italian food through mass production and the prevalence of American cultural exports everywhere has forced us to accept mediocre dishes as the standard. These dishes use old, chewy bacon instead of guanciale; salty, starchy, powdery parmesan with a texture similar to a social lubricant ubiquitous on Wall Street; store brought dried, chewy pasta as a vehicle for the sauce; and most importantly, xanthan gum to lend the pasta cohesion in order to hide the underpaid, overworked chef’s lack of skill in emulsifying pasta sauces.
Do yourself a favour and seek out a local Italian establishment- one that uses guanciale in the carbonara- and taste the difference between an actual carbonara and what you’ve assumed is a carbonara for your entire life. As one famous quote goes, “mediocrity is a sin”- or as I transliterate it to “never settle for a pasta that uses shit ingredients”. Local pasta in Rome is cheap, fresh, and even healthy given the average 10k steps-a-day mileage for the average commuter. To find the best, bang-for-buck establishments frequented by local patrons, ask the cab drivers for where they would eat. Or even go in the opposite direction to the tourist hivemind, and maybe then you’ll actually experience some local culture.
Walk down any Roman street, and you’ll find small, quaint trattorias selling suppli- a gooey, cheesy ball of leftover risotto or pasta that is doused in egg, coated with breadcrumbs and deep fried. You’ll find this everywhere in Rome. But it is often overlooked by small-minded tourists who conceptualize Italian food as pizza and pasta. Supplis (not to be confused with the Southern Arancini) are a small snack that are a cultural equivalent of a samosa- eaten either as an appetizer or between meals to satiate one’s appetite. Suppli can be quite intoxicating, addictive and pair well with local beer creating the ideal bitter and salty-savoury combination that hits the right spot at 2 am on a Thursday night.
We think we know Italian food. But we don’t. There are so many cultural variations and dishes that we’ve never tried, and that we’ll probably never try. Most of these dishes never make it out of Italy because Americans haven’t yet found an efficient way to ruin them yet. To go to Italy, and look for an Alfredo with grilled chicken on menus while committing the cardinal sin of asking the waiter for chilli flakes to spice your pasta is a disservice to the centuries old Italian culture that has tried, tested and perfected their foods. If you’ve ordered chilli flakes or chilli oil (as most Indians I know) at an Italian restaurant, you probably don’t deserve to go to Italy. Respect the local culture, appreciate it for what it is, and please, do NOT make the whole table wait while you immaculately position the dishes for your Instagram story. Not only are you upsetting everyone at the table, you’re also upsetting the Italians. Their dishes don’t need your Instagram story to popularize them. They’ve already refined their cuisine over centuries of experimentation.
My short, 36-hour Rome stay was eventful- I explored virtually all of Rome on foot, resorting to public transport only when necessary. I’ve tried everything Rome has on platter- the gelatos, the Pizzas, the Suppli, the Pastas, the coffee, the pistachio cornetto. But there is still a lot left to see- Italy is not just Rome, Venice or Milan. Italy is Sicily, Naples, Emilia-Romagna, Calibria, Lombardy, Tuscany, and so much more. To say, that I know Italian food is an injustice to Italy. I, on the other hand, can affirm that I know Rome, and I hope that perhaps one day, I will know Italy.
There is a saying in Rome: “The Milanese eat to live. Us Romans, on the other hand, live to eat.” The Roman experience is derived from the food. And perhaps, there is no Rome without its food- so the Roman Empire hasn’t completely died out. Its legacy lives on through its flavours, ingredients and culinary pastiches. The Roman sculptures look on as the centuries pass by. Empires come and go, and with it, the foreigners that visit Rome to witness the greatest city ever built. Neighborhoods, metro-lines, bus routes and office buildings are continuously built and destroyed on top of the ruins of an ancient, great civilization. Rome has always been in a churn of creative destruction. And all that remains- and all that will ever remain- is the food, sculptures and the Roman sun.

Part I
One of my clients, Chad Fuentes, recently said something that stayed with me:
“I feel like sometimes we romanticize the past and put undue praise on characters or people from that past, while holding the people supporting us in the present to an unfair standard.”
Yes. There’s truth in that.
I had been reflecting on something similar while watching a speech from one of our national leaders — perhaps the President addressing Congress or the Senate. I can’t recall the exact details, but the image was clear: the structure, the solemnity, the way history lives and breathes through these halls. And I found myself thinking, There it is. Rome. Different time, different clothes, same posture.
This isn’t cynicism — it’s recognition.
We, the people, love to imagine that we’ve evolved. That our systems, our sophistication, our technology have moved us forward. But have we? Strip away the gold and the marble, and we are often still functioning from the same roots. The same hunger for power. The same imbalance. The same blindness to the living beauty beside and within each of us.

“Mille viae ducunt homines per saecula Romam” — Alain de Lille, Liber Parabolarum
The phrase “All roads lead to Rome” is a proverb that originated from the ancient Roman Empire, reflecting the city’s central importance as a hub of trade, culture, and power.
In a broader sense, it means that there are many different paths or approaches to reach a particular goal or destination. For single mothers in Indonesia, this proverb holds a significant meaning. It represents the understanding that they often face numerous challenges and obstacles in providing for their children and ensuring their well-being. Even when it seems like there are no viable options, single mothers need to be resilient and resourceful, creating new paths to navigate and overcome the difficulties they encounter.
Their children cannot wait for a clear path to access their basic needs, such as food, shelter, and education. It is the responsibility of single mothers to provide these necessities, even if it means forging new paths and finding alternative sources of income. Single mothers cannot rely on their children’s fathers to fulfill their financial ‘obligations’ and give child support, so they must continue to strive for self-sufficiency and sustainability.
I cannot imagine the struggle faced by single mothers without the privileges of higher education, extensive networks, or even personal branding like mine. With a relatively high level of education, the privilege to live in the capital city, and a strong personal brand, I am currently feeling almost desperate in my search for a path to my own version of Rome. I can only imagine the challenges faced by other women who may still be recovering from the abandonment of their former husbands, having been allowed to be only housewives for years and financially dependent on them. My heart goes out to them, and I hope they are always empowered to find their own paths to Rome, their own versions of success.
For me personally, I am still navigating a path that hopefully leads to my version of Rome. I am still somewhat afraid because this time the road is dark and full of obstacles. I am still terrified because I often feel powerless, considering my age and the fact that I have a son who is still fully dependent on me. They say there are many roads to Rome, and I personally believe that. There are many ways to generate income without having to work in an office. However, not everyone can or wants to take those paths.
Some may not be able to see the options in front of them because to them, it’s too dark and eerie, for some others, they would rather close their eyes in fear of the uncertainties. If you currently feel unable to navigate these paths and want to give up, take a break, I feel you. Once you have regained some of your strength, you can continue. If you are currently closing your eyes out of fear, it’s okay to be scared. Give yourself time to muster up the courage and give yourself a chance to see what choices you have.
The important thing is not to give up. Hang in there. If you experience various rejections, it does not mean you have failed. It could be that you are being protected from a much worse condition or being redirected towards a better path to your own version of Rome.
One day, I hope you will look back and see your today as an adventure and valuable experience that you can remember with joy in your hearts. Until then, just hang in there.
I love yous!

Disclaimer: I got a little wild in this article, hide the kids.
History has a tendency to leave out very obvious same-sex relationships. We have all heard of the astute gentleman who lived with his lifelong platonic male friend in a house with one bed. You may not have heard that Hadrian was so head over heels for his lover Antinous that he declared him a god upon Antinous’s death.
I’m sure your partner is kind to you, but have they ever made you a fucking god?
The term homosexuality did not exist in the language of the Romans. So when discussing same-sex relationships in the empire, we have to do so through a lens we may not initially understand. This article will explore how Romans saw sex in general with a few notable examples.
We can only go off historical accounts, artifacts, and writings of the time when discussing civilizations as old as Rome. So while these views might be the majority opinion, there were likely severe deviations in mindset on a one-to-one level.
There was almost certainly an old bitter roman telling younger generations to pull their damn togas up.
We define homosexuality as a relationship between two people of the same gender. Romans defined sex through power and status, which means that as long as you were the dominant party, your reputation was unaffected.
To put it gently, it was admirable to be the sword and pitiful to be the sheath. Didn’t really expect to be conjuring up historical metaphors for anal sex when I woke up today, but here we are.
This could be seen at the highest level of roman society. Nero enjoyed the casual midweek orgy with men and women and did just about everything you can sexually do throughout his life. This includes dressing as an animal and attacking the genitals of tied-up men and women.
The emperor was batshit crazy, but you can’t knock his creativity. He also had sex with his mother. This fun fact isn’t relevant to the article — but I’m telling you anyway.
Nero had a young eunuch boy as his wife named Sporus, who was supposedly the spitting image of his late wife. This speaks to the more common pederasty of the time, but we won’t be getting into that here. I don’t discuss pedophilia before noon, as a rule. This marriage was peculiar but did not hurt the esteem of the emperor; it simply hinted at his mental instability.
It wasn’t until he took the former slave Pythagoras as a husband that everyone started giving a bit of side-eye. This was made worse by the fact that they had sex in front of their wedding guests. This resentment by the onlookers was not because Romans had disdain for same-sex relations. It was because their emperor was the “woman” in the relationship.
This leads me to an important point, Rome was plainly misogynistic. So even though it might seem like Rome was a sexually liberated place for its time, things were far less equal when it came to women. In fact, many considered lesbian relationships an unthinkable transgression.
This did not mean people of the time did not talk about it. A notable myth is that of Iphis, who was a girl raised as a boy. She falls in love with her appointed wife and is turned into a man by Isis. There is also the fictional story of Megilla, who changed her name and wore a wig to marry a Demonassa.
Several people, including Ovid, said women being sexually active exclusively with other women was an exceedingly rare occurrence.
What is more likely is that women were far less open about it than unquestionably powerful men like Nero, Hadrian, and Elagabalus. This is reinforced by the fact that it was seen largely as very socially unacceptable. Sadly, when lesbian relationships were discussed, it was typically with a tone of shame and disapproval.
This might have been due to how Rome perceived women and sex in general. For a woman to sleep with another woman meant that there would be a dominant partner. This was seen as masculine and looked down upon by the people of the time.
Women had an incredibly restrictive life in Rome. This speaks to the intelligence of the many that did manage to rise to power, as it was a very dangerous path to walk for those not born a man. I’ll cover that more when I get into Agrippina the younger, who was a fascinating figure and Nero’s mother.
Y’know, the one he slept with.
We can draw a lot of parallels from Rome, though their society was quite a bit different than it appears on the surface. It should also be said that several of the sexual liberties given to people were reserved for the higher parts of society, with lower social classes being allowed much less personal freedom.
Stay tuned for a more in-depth look at Elagabalus, who is a fascinating character and one of the first transgender people recorded in history.
I’ll drink less coffee next time.
Thanks,
Jack

I always wanted to go visit Rome and Tuscany, but for a while viewed them as two separate trips. But then I thought to myself, why not combine them? I had only seven days to spend in Italy, so it was a challenge.
Would the memories from traveling to Rome overshadow Tuscany? Would I be able to manage logistics and stay within my budget?
Looking back, I think it was a great idea. And now, in the winter of 2023, if someone had asked me what impressed me the most, I would say:
in Rome — Colosseum and in Tuscany — Pitigliano.
Rome Colosseum
I went inside, closed my eyes, and imagined what it was like to live in Rome 2000 years ago when on average 80000 people were watching fights lasting days at the time. Brutal fights, where gladiators were fighting with each other and with wild animals. Where spectators were deciding who lived and who died in the arena below.
The spectators in the Colosseum had separate seats with men being separated from women.
Romans did not have any problems with killing each other just for fun and regularly attending brothels…

When in Rome, See This Treasure:
Saint Cecilia in Trastevere: Patron Saint of Singers, Composers, and Musicians
A quiet Trastevere via opens to a large landscaped courtyard, which fronts this Basilica that was built over the home where Cecilia lived and died.
The courtyard is a lovely neighborhood playground — where you’re bound to see mammas circling strollers around the central Roman urn and nuns chatting away after mass.
In third century Rome, Cecilia was known as the girl who heard angelic harmonies — she could play any instrument or sing any song. She secretly swore to be a chaste Christian, but went through with a marriage her parents arranged anyway. On the wedding night, she broke the news to her husband Valerian, telling him the only way he could touch her was to become a Christian, so he ran off to get baptized. When he returned, he found their bridal chamber transformed — full of flowers and Cecilia wearing a crown of lilies and roses. This miracle swept Valerian into the faith. He made it his mission to help the poor and bury Christian martyrs, and was beheaded for his belief.
Then Cecilia was tortured for her faith, forced into a tub of boiling water in her own bathtub. She sang all…

I want to talk about a recent trend in mobile gaming. It’s the trend of desktop/console games getting re-imagined and made into mobile games. We’ve had all sorts; from League of Legends Wild Rift, to Call of Duty Mobile and even Nintendo getting in on the action with Mario Kart.
These games are not typically straight remasters. They are often altered versions of the original experience.
This means I have been left disappointed on several occasions as I download a game from a beloved franchise expecting the same high quality experience I’m used to on console. Only to get something very different.
Typically I have found it goes one of 2 ways with these console/desktop titles reappearing on mobile:
This is a game I loved as a child and when I realised it had got a mobile re-release I tentatively downloaded it expecting another second rate experience. O boy was I wrong, it’s brilliant!
Rome Total War is a strategy game with 2 types of game play:
So it’s not the simplest game out there. There is a lot of depth and freedom in what you can do in both the campaigns and the battles themselves. Given this, it may seem remarkable that this translates so well to mobile.
Google maps is a fantastic product, and one of the reasons for this is that it’s intuitive to use both on your phone and desktop. It is so easy to explore the world with Google Maps. Whether pinching or scrolling to zoom, clicking or tapping, there is no friction to navigation. Neither mobile nor desktop feel like imitators of the other.
Whether intentional or not, Total War has achieved the same thing with its map navigation. Creating what feels like a completely seamless experience on mobile when navigating the map, even when compared to the old desktop experience. This is hugely important as a large part of this game is about navigating 2D or 3D environments in order to make strategic decisions. It sounds so simple but getting this navigation right, to me is the cornerstone of what makes Rome such a good port.
Alongside the map navigation exploring the UI and interacting with map elements is also incredibly frictionless. With certain button sizes scaled up and freedom in how you scale the HUD I never once felt limited using a touch screen over a mouse and keyboard.
Now this is going to sound overly simplified but here it is. Rome Total War on mobile is such a great game because it is exactly the same as Rome Total War on desktop, and that was a great game.
As far as I can tell nothing is missing from the mobile version versus the desktop game. This means the same incredibly deep campaign experience is available in your pocket.
With too many mobile ports you see simplification or compromises made on the original experience. Which as mentioned before can leave you feeling unsatisfied. Rome Total War does not compromise and that is great.
The best part of Rome Total War is the campaigns. When I played Total War as a child I would play for hours on end, working my way through campaigns one turn at a time. Now if I have hours to play games typically I won’t be on my phone.
However I feel like this port has got me playing just as much as I did as a child, but in a very different way.
You see because the campaigns are turn based this means they are filled with natural pauses. Each turn still takes me 5–10 minutes but this time the game lives in my pocket. Meaning Rome Total War through this brilliant port has shifted from an experience I would settle into on a Sunday afternoon to something I can pick up here and there throughout the week.
So basically I loved Rome Total War as a kid, and now I’ve fallen in love with it again.
The controls are so intuitive you would have thought the game was made for touch screens and the experience is not comprised at all when compared to the desktop version. On top of that the game being on my phone allows for a new style of play. Giving me little bursts of nostalgia throughout my week.
Overall I think Rome Total War is great example of how you can re-release old titles on mobile and breathe new life into them.

In the 2000 years since Roman Emperor Septimius Severus’s reign, many don’t seem to know he was an African man with brown skin. And when I say brown skin, I don’t mean he was a little tan. According to a family portrait painted during his lifetime, Emperor Severus’s skin was an even richer shade of brown:
We’ll talk about why this matters in a moment. But first, please also take a look at Daniel Voshart’s photoreal portrait of all the Roman emperors in which Emperor Severus is featured on the third row in the third image from the left here:
voshart.medium.com
Kinda brown, huh?
The full richness of Severus’s melanin is not prominent in the light colored marble statue of him which was found in Egypt and created somewhere between 193–200 A.D. Held at The British Museum, the statue does depict Severus’s hair and beard as being quite curly. Several coins bearing his image also feature him with curly hair.

I feel like I should be documenting this somewhere. Partially because it feels too good to be true, and the other part, well — believes that everyone should know what everlasting happiness is. Even if it’s just for a moment.
I just moved to a new City. And it’s a godsend. The people here look like me. They speak both my native languages, and they welcome me with their culture. Their hugs. The microcosms in their face, they express gratitude for our shared experience.
The food enriches my being in a way I have not felt in some time. Not all of it tastes like home, but that’s what makes it so familiar. Deeply nourishing to the Ori.
And then.. there’s him. I met an artist. Full of love, of life. Of pain. And also, of beauty. Everything he’s been through shows nowhere on his being. His hands are soft, like a pianist. His callouses showcase strength, fight, only present because life unfortunately placed them there. But he still smiles. He still laughs. And enjoys the little things that life has to offer him.
He’s passionate. As both a lover and a being. He’s armorous. Unshielded for selected few. Olodumare blessed me with an opportunity to see him bare. And his soul — it lights me entirely. His rage and anger, they’re subtle and fleeting. His eyes, a golden honey. His lips, kisses wet enough to quench a thirst I never knew was lingering.
I believe that God gave me the strength and carried me through, just to bring me right here. To know a warmth so pure, so true. And know how to cherish it when it arrived at my doorstep.
And I swear on everything that I know, I would go through it all over again just to meet him once more — in this moment. Right here. Right now.
I’ve always wanted to go to Rome. Since I was a child. Little did I know that the city would offer more than pasta and parmigiano. It would be the thing that brought colors of me back to the canvas. And ultimately, a subconscious iridescence back to life.

Feature by Katie McKnoulty
Now one of Europe’s up-and-coming voices in food, Saghar works with leading editorial and commercial clients; runs cooking workshops across Italy; and has previously contributed to Italy’s national newspaper, Corriere della Sera. Her debut cookbook, Pomegranates & Artichokes, aims to show our innate similarities as humans by tracking recipes on her journey from Iran to Italy. We couldn’t wait to discover Saghar’s Travel Playbook of recommendations to experience when in Rome.
When I was born, we were not only in full Islamic regime, but we were in the middle of a war with Iraq which went from ’80 to ’88. It was very traumatic because I was literally born under bombs. My earliest memories are of the sirens that went off in Tehran that announced the bombings, and we used to put big chunks of tape on the windows so that if they broke, they wouldn’t break into our homes. We would go away for short periods of time when the bombings were very intense, to other cities. I remember very well that they had bombed maybe a few blocks away from our house, and I remember that the curtain of my room had been ripped apart by glass.
From a very early age, the first thing we learned is that your life at home is a very different life from your life outdoors. So indoors, everything is normal — you have parties, your family comes, you put on music. And then we would go to school, and we would have to wear the veil and everything. And your parents would tell you, ‘You shouldn’t say to anyone that we were dancing at home yesterday’ or ‘You should never, ever say that daddy had a drink, because all of that is illegal, OK?’. You don’t know who to trust, and then eventually you learn that almost all of the kids going to your school are living in a similar situation.
At the university where I studied art and architecture in Tehran, we had a very rigid education about composition and light. I struggled a lot in university in Iran to understand things and find my own visual language. Art especially wasn’t my thing, but my mathematical brain understood composition very well. Then, in Rome, I studied graphic design and design general. And eventually, I moved towards photography and food because I became really passionate about it.
I didn’t know anything about Rome. I chose Rome mainly because it was the Italian capital and in my silly, 20-year-old head, the capital is the place to go. This is what I thought. But when I arrived here, despite the difficulties that it has, I really fell in love with it. For those of us coming from countries like Iran, as students, the experience of arriving in Italy is very, very different from that sort of Under the Tuscan Sun experience. We live in a different dimension: when we arrive here, our goal is survival and we don’t have any funds or anything. And we still need to find a job, and we need to do all of these things in Italian. I went through hell because I was really scared of not being able to make it and having to go back to Iran. Even to this day, whenever I go somewhere and I come back here, I’m happy to come back to Rome. It grabs you and never lets go of you.
Rome is a ridiculously beautiful city. I think that’s very important to me. There are certain aesthetic things — like the trees, Roman pines that are like umbrellas, against the backdrop of the ochre and orange buildings. And the blue sky of Rome is something special. It struck me very, very hard in the beginning. And it still does. And then of course it’s historical; it’s charming; it’s got all of those classic grand things that are very beautiful. They give me joy, as frivolous as it may sound.
I live somewhere between the Colosseum and a neighborhood called Esquilino. And over the years it was not known as a very nice place, but now it’s becoming very nice and lovely — I think there’s been a bit of gentrification. It has a very, very long street called Via Merulana that leads to the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore; one of Rome’s biggest treasures. They have extraordinary medieval mosaics there — absolutely stunning. I love that church a lot. And then, in terms of museums, Palazzo Massimo and Palazzo Altemps are some of the most beautiful things that you can see — not just in Rome, but in Italy, possibly in the world. Often my suggestion to people who can’t get Vatican tickets or who don’t want to queue for three-and-a-half hours under the burning sun, is to get a combo ticket. It lasts for two days and you can see all of them, including the Vatican. It’s mind-blowing, absolutely mind-blowing.
In the side streets of the Via Merulana, there are a couple of nice places. One of them is a new bakery — Forno Conti. They have bread of course, but also croissants and cakes, and it’s become very popular. There’s a little community around it. It’s very different from the classic Roman bakery. Then there’s a little wine bar that’s quite famous now in Trastevere called Enoteca l’Antidoto, and they have very nice natural wines and littles dishes. There’s another trattoria called Trattoria Pennestri. The food is Roman but with an elegant little twist. You need to book but it’s not impossible to get in.
I do a lot of shopping at Esquilino Market. To be honest, the quality of fruit and veg is not always, like, a farmers market, but it’s possibly the most multicultural market in Rome. And you can find a lot of ingredients that you can’t find anywhere else. The African community shops there; the Chinese community shops there; the Bangladeshi and Indian community shops there. So it’s very interesting.
After university I discovered food blogs. Some of them were people who were very much like me — they had a background in the arts and now they were working with food. Some of them were doing astonishing photography, and that was the moment that it clicked. And I thought, ‘I can do this’ — not so much because I knew how to do photography, because I didn’t, but because I knew composition and I knew light. So I started practicing. It took me some time but it was also very nice, because for the first time I had found my visual language — the thing that I had struggled so much to find. It was very liberating.
The more I worked with food, the more I was intrigued with its cultural and political aspects and what it represents. So I started blogging about it and writing about it. And this is how I came to write my first cookbook, Pomegranates & Artichokes, which is exactly about those things. It’s also autobiographical, and this is what I do: I love to look at cultures, habits and situations through the lens of food, literally and figuratively.
Pomegranates & Artichokes is a cookbook that starts in Iran; then it travels west, crossing the Mediterranean and the Middle East through Turkey, Greece, Lebanon and Syria, all of those countries. And it arrives in Italy as if you were taking a flight — it literally does this journey. I love watching the map thing on the airplane and this is exactly that. I got this idea because this is a book that is born out of my experience of living as an Iranian, but mostly as an immigrant, here in Italy, in the West. This whole book is about how a lot of the flavors, ingredients and cooking methods are super similar. We’re not even that far, geographically speaking. Basically, you cross Greece and Turkey, and you’re in Iran — so how is it that people from my side of the world are treated so differently where our food is so similar? So this book is a testimony to those similarities.
It started because of the protests of the death of Mahsa Amini, who was murdered because she was showing a few strands of hair. So it is about compulsory hijab, and yet it is not just about compulsory hijab. There are many rights that women in Iran don’t have: the testimony of a woman in court is worth half of a man’s; women can work but if your husband says you cannot work then you cannot work; you can’t have rights to the custody of your child if you get divorced; and you can’t ask for a divorce — the right to divorce lies with the husband. What’s happening to the women in Iran concerns us all. And the fight against the Iranian regime is the fight to be on the right side of history.
Always window. I like to have space to lean out and look out of the window. But it’s mostly the leaning thing.
‘Via da Roma’ by Luca Barbarossa, from the album Roma è de tutti. The name says it all. It’s very nice.
Contradictory.
There are a lot of beautiful things and lots of ugly things. Like all big cities.

After a long silence (because reasons), I return to Medium (as intended a while ago!) I actually have several unfinished stories, some that are in old school notebooks and others just existing as a draft in title. So content is in abundance and hopefully I’ll be able to share more and more consistently in the coming weeks. I even acquired a tablet, with one of the main motives being more writing. In fact, my return article is related: I’ll write about a game I’ve been playing on the tablet. So without further ado, let’s talk Grow Empire: Rome!
As an avid Starcraft UMS and Warcraft 3 custom map player, I’m always on the lookout for tower defense maps on mobile. My recent search brought me to Grow Empire Rome. The name was familiar, but I hadn’t give it much thought at first. The reason it was familiar was because of a game I played on my phone before: Grow Castle and I would indeed notice the gameplay parallels quite soon into the game. They aren’t developed by same people from what it seems and indeed there seems to be a major difference between the games. Okay, enough with the fluff and meta, let me talk about the game!
Grow Empire Rome, GER from now on, is a defense game, rather than a traditional TD. As you might imagine, it has a Roman Empire setting. You have a base where barbarians attack, wave by wave, each wave triggered by you. So you don’t start a game and play 10 waves. You play one wave and it’s over. You can start the next one if you like. On top of that, there is an empire map and you can launch invasions on enemy colonies to acquire them, which sort of reverses the roles. Each acquired colony then has 3 waves of rebels you can fight whenever you wish. I haven’t bested the 3rd level yet, but I’m guessing that’s it.
You gain gold from kills in each wave (meaning you get some even if you fail the defense) plus some amount from your colonies. This amount can be increased by upgrading the colonies by investing in some gold. You even generate some of this gold when you are not playing. You will also get the option to watch an ad to get some gold now and then. Gold is used for upgrading your walls, archers, towers and units. The upgrades will occasionally have visual affects too. Units will look better every 4 upgrades and your flimsy fences will turn into actual walls with archers and towers in time.
The other currency, crystals, is acquired after every 10 levels or so, plus by defeating the rebellions in colonies. Crystals are used to buy and upgrade heroes, a type of unit that brings a passive bonus to your army as well as fighting actively on the front line. You also use crystals to upgrade your bank, which in turn improves your gold gain from colonies when you aren’t playing the game. You can also buy card packs with crystals. These you can use when invading colonies to provide you bonuses. Finally, you can buy mercenaries, which are extra troops you can use in invasions. As you might imagine, you can buy crystals and farming them takes some time (but not too terrible to unlock the most expensive hero to be honest.)
Finally, you gain experience from battles. This is earned by the General, which is basically you. You can level up and distribute skill points to unlock passive and active skills. I’m not sure if there are ceilings for these bonuses. I believe the cost to increase a skill also increases in time. I have leveled one to 20 and so far haven’t seen it though.
Each wave is basically a bunch of enemies rushing at your walls, fighting any troops they may encounter on the way. Your archers and towers will attack any enemies in their range but your main fighting force will be the reinforcements you summon. There are several unit types that will attack you and you will use to defend, sort of in a Rock Paper Scissors setup.
Speaking of unit types, there are 4+1+1 in total. 4 are the core units that you can use anywhere: Infantry, anti-cavalry infantry, ranged and cavalry. Then there is the siege unit, which is a battering ram that resembles Age of Empires variants. This is only used by the sieging party, not the defenders. Finally there is the elephant. From what I see this is only for the computer. Oh, and the heroes I mentioned above. I only saw them for our side and I imagine computer do not have them.
Normal waves will only spawn two types of units, one group after the other e.g one ranged, then one infantry, then another ranged… until the whole wave is cleared. You will have two charges of reinforcements at the start and you can use any of the 4 types, you don’t need to choose a layout. This will come handy in every 10 levels where there will be bigger groups of enemies in sort of mini waves, and their unit types will also change within a single wave. Every 30 levels you will face elephants that are loaded with hp and offensive power. Luckily, you aren’t limited to the two types of units at the start: As soon as you summon a unit, the bar will start filling and you’ll be able to summon more during the fight.
In addition to summoning troops, you have a few active powers you can use. These are your defenses (catapult and towers) and your general powers (e.g. raining arrows on enemies.) Some are skill shots (like the catapult) and others just work (like the general power that gives a damage boost.) You can also choose the ammunition type of your towers to be more effective versus troops or siege units.
The second part of the game is the colony map where you invade colonies, upgrade them and defend them against rebels. There are several colonies with increasing defense strengths, indicated by numbers on them. You can have 3 legions in each attack, which have 6 unit slots each. My legion consists of 4 main units, my hero and the siege unit. I believe the rest is to add mercenaries and maybe probably other heroes as well. Not much to do here as you don’t summon extra units and have no towers. You just use your general powers. The enemy has some troops at the start and gets reinforcements, so usually you’ll use them on cooldown to win as soon as possible. Once you take over, you can upgrade them a few times to increase the income, then fight the rebel waves whenever you want. This is basically a reverse invasion: the strength of base depends on the colony and the whole army attacks altogether.
The game shop is pretty simple. You can buy crystals, which you can use to buy commanders and card packs. If you just want to unlock the heroes, the crystal package around 20€ is enough (Germany IOS store) and a more pragmatic approach might be to buy less crystals and only get the Roman Commander (the most expensive one,) or maybe buy the same amount of crystals and just use the surplus to upgrade him a bunch. For the record, you don’t need this hero. The one you get through the campaign is pretty good and has a gold bonus that should be useful for a new account.
In the end, it’s nice that the game does not force you buy anything. But then again, I usually buy something from free games if I spent some time on it… but I really didn’t feel like buying anything.
All in all, I did sink some hours into the game in the last days. But it was also because I was sick and resting at home. I feel like I’ll depart ways as I don’t think there is more to see in this game. It doesn’t feel challenging, there isn’t much to see other than a couple soldier models and the grind is way too steep.
That said, if you are looking for something to play on the train or you know, the sacred part of the house, feel free to take a look. I did enjoy majority of the time I sank.
Before I end the article, there is another topic I want to talk about.
Now, checking the downloads and review counts, I notice that GER is way bigger than Grow Castle but since I played Grow Castle first, I want to compare them a bit.
The major difference is that GrowCastle uses the auto fight mechanic. You get some of it via playing and you can purchase it if you want: Basically the game will launch waves on its own and will use skills on cooldown. Sounds weird, but it actually works because in the end, the game is super repetitive and you basically play because of three reasons: Leaderboards, to unlock everything to see how they work (that’s me) and either lack of or surplus of will power to unlock everything and max them out. For the second, you only need a certain amount of grind and you want to be done with them. The other two makes you grind A LOT. So you want the result but without the effort… because the effort is really just starting waves after a while, then upgrading something every 5–10 waves or so. It’s not skill, it’s monkey work (no offense to tablet using chimps.)
I really, really expected this to appear in GER because the core loops of the two games are literally the same. But it didn’t appear and honestly, I’m a bit disappointed. I would love to see the final forms of the soldiers but I don’t know if I want to endure through the grind.
Despite GER being the bigger title, I think Grow Castle was more interesting in terms of content. There are many heroes and tower types to choose from and you can actually have builds in that game. Unfortunately, it looked to me like in GER you can just upgrade the main soldiers (which are out of the Rock Paper Scissors — they have no advantages or disadvantages) and summon them and only them and succeed. The comments I’ve read online also indicate that way.
So if you liked GER, I would strongly recommend to check out Grow Castle too. In fact, I would recommend it over GER, unless you are here for the theme.

We sat on the edge of high seats, resting elbows and ales on a wine barrel that had been fashioned into a table. Pigeons cooed on the cobblestones around our feet, foraging for crumbs and shards of cracker crisp crust that rained to the ground as we bit into our sandwiches. I had to hunch over parted legs to keep from covering myself in falling arugula and dripping olive oil as I ate. Mike leaned similarly across from me, his sandwich partially exposed but still neatly cradled in its parchment wrapping, a wad of napkins clutched in his right hand to wipe the corners of his mouth as he sipped and chewed. Over his shoulder I watched my romanticized vision of Rome play like a scrolling vignette, fairytale pictures unfurling from the pages of a luxury travel magazine.
Families and tourists wandered the narrow side street like a driven flock, progressing from the Tiber River on to the Spanish Steps awaiting them at the end of the cobblestone shoot. Heads swiveled and eyes swept in every direction, not a single explorer mindful of the path directly in front of them. Each was lost in their own sense of wonder. I followed the gaze of a little girl in a flowery yellow sundress. She wore a pink hoodie to keep her warm against the early spring breeze and her mother tugged her along by the hand. As she traipsed her attention remained fixed on a large three dimensional cone jutting out above the door of an artisan gelato shop. A huge scoop of pistachio gelato perched so perfectly on the plastic waffle that I imagined it dripping onto her outstretched tongue as she passed underneath.
A young bride-to-be led a parade of attendants from a corner flower stall. They wound their way around and through the creeping throng of tourists. Each had their hands full with a flat of matching centerpiece arrangements. Porcelain white lilies with long slender stalks of green, perfectly positioned and pinned, peaking out of vases the way only an artist could do. The florist, minding brilliant pops of crimson, fuchsia and marigold under a vast white umbrella, beamed with a contented smile as she watched her artistry depart. She was roused from her prideful stare by a lovestruck gentleman wishing to purchase a bouquet. I adored this about Rome, the prevalence of corner flower stalls. These oases struck wild contradiction to the bustling chaos; a fragrant reminder to temper progress with love and frivolity.
Rome was all this way. Everyday life coexisting effortlessly with the fray of visitors. Housewives with canvas bags of fruit and loaves of bread. Delivery drivers beeping and weaving their scooters through seas of pedestrian traffic, indifferent to potential catastrophe. Shopkeepers wandered out of their stores to chat and smoke cigarettes with their neighbors. Fashionable couples walked dogs and tenants added to growing piles of refuse spilling out of already overfilled dumpsters. The sounds of suitcases rolling and clacking over ancient pavers mixing with the patter of peddlers. It was a symphony. I was in love with Rome’s nuanced perfection. But no moment brought me more joy than this — our simple picnic perched outside of IL Salumaio, immersed in it all.
I’d wanted one experience in Rome: an authentic Italian sandwich made with hand shaved artisan charcuterie, layered on rustic bread with fresh cheeses and fragrant oil. I craved the experience I’d witnessed TV chefs and travel vloggers drool over time and time again. I wanted to have my own moment. A first satisfying bite that would send my eyes rolling back in my head with gastronomic euphoria. Mike was eager for pizza but Rome to me had to be this consummate sandwich picked up at an authentic corner shop. It had to be a genuine place, a place locals might go themselves for lunch. I wanted the staff to be a little indignant at our brass to invade their native sanctuary with our travel maps and attempts at broken Italian. I’d been swooning over the fruition of this sandwich months before my first airport margarita.
And I was nervous. I did not want to waste my opportunity on an imitation or weak trattoria contender. How were we to choose? I’d researched so many possibilities that I was dizzy with worry. What if we got it wrong and my vision of Rome shattered, leaving me with rancid memories of crowded lineups and the unending wail of emergency vehicle sirens? The stakes were high. This was our last day in Rome, we’d almost used up our half dozen dining opportunities in the city before departing for Sorrento. Until the hunger rumbling in my belly grew louder than the nagging for success I was dangerously close to overthinking the whole thing and missing out on my quintessential sandwich experience entirely.
We were on route to the Spanish Steps, having spent the early part of the day touring the Vatican Museum. It was well past midday and I was growing cranky, I fully admit it. My morning cornetto and cappuccino wore off somewhere between the Sistine Chapel and St. Angelo Bridge and hunger was gaining control of my good mood and cheerful disposition. Mike and I have been married long enough to recognize when we’ve met the point of perturbation that requires one of us to maturely recognize the importance of food. He reeled me in, “let’s eat.” and I was fully on board. I no longer cared as much about the authenticity of the trattoria we would find, as I did the necessity to get the thing done and put some food in my belly.
Hunger is under-appreciated by the traveler. We tend so easily to keep full, to graze endlessly and maintain a constantly satiated state. Trying bits of this and that and endeavoring to consume memories with the same fervor we use to fill camera phones. Not often do we allow our bellies to rumble and tell us we’re low on fuel. But hunger, the small h kind with light pangs and hankerings, the kind that clouds your good humor and makes you snap with insincerity can be a good thing. That kind of hunger spurs creativity and shuts up the food critic who, back home, keeps grape jelly away from corn chips. It makes us fall for gas station hotdogs and lures us to try regional oddities, offal stew and platters of whole sardines grilled with lemon and paprika. Hunger can be a blessing to a food experience traveler. Sometimes it’s the only thing that gets us out of our own head and opens us up to chance encounters. Hunger, on this day, in its wisdom, turned us left and forced us across the threshold of the first shop we could locate with meats and cheeses hanging in the window.
Inside Il Salumaio the wall displayed a dozen menu offerings, a curated list of combinations customers could order with ease. No sandwich had more than five or six quality components, and every ingredient in its own right sounded downright delicious. Glass cases were filled with cured meats and ripe cheeses. Prosciuttos and aging coppas hung overhead. The smell of fresh bread wafted from behind saloon doors and the resulting large flat sheets of rustic loaves were piled on the counter waiting to be portioned and sliced open. Bowls of sun ripened pomodoro and fresh mozzarella di bufala, marinated artichokes and basil crowded one end of the display case. Bottles of olive oil, truffle oils and an array of balsamics lined a shelf behind the counter. The hinges of my jaw twinged and tingled. I wanted so badly to touch and smell everything, I wanted to devour a chisel of gritty parmesan and secure a handful of olives to stuff in my pocket for later.
I halted my rumbling instead with an offering of whisper thin pistachio studded mortadella piled with wedges of Grana Padano, honey infused truffle oil and a large handful of arugula. Mike opted for the Italiano, a simple combination of prosciutto crudo, mozzarella di bufalo, tomato and basil. And there we sat, out there in the street with the pigeons, taking it all in. Swapping our choices halfway through as we often do. Enjoying the simplest of meals curated by chance and living fully in the moment that will forever encapsulate the memory of Rome for me. That sandwich made it all real. It fixed the impression of Rome to my spirit for eternity and I’ll be forever grateful to hunger and serendipity for this moment.
Back home from time to time, I make large flattish loaves of ciabatta and pile them with the best Italian cured meats I can acquire. It costs a fortune compared to the few euros a hand held lunch with pigeons cost us in Rome but with the best company and a lovely smattering of quality olive oil I can almost smell the orange trees and the Tiber River. I add wedges of parm and ripe tomato, handfuls of arugula and metered doses of the truffle oil we brought home in our suitcase cocooned inside a clean pair of socks. We sit in near silence together, quietly reliving memories. I think of cobblestones and a little girl in a yellow flowered sundress. I crave gelato and run my mind over the smoothly worn treads of the Spanish Steps. Mike tosses coins into Trevi fountain and we circle the trek around the Coliseum. We partake in an evening passeggiata and visit the Pantheon at dusk, but I always come back to that moment on Via Della Croce when my eyes rolled back in my head, fully involved in that first magical bite of Italy.
This is the joy of traveling for me. Losing myself in unplanned encounters, tying my memories to meals I attempt to recreate at home. I owe so much of my joy to moments of hunger and its gentle reminder that letting go is part of the experience. A part that very often leads to the greatest discoveries and experiencing the true authenticity of a place. A reminder that the pleasure of something as mundane as a sandwich should never be overlooked. The whole of a culture could be hiding in just one bite.

Me, Chelsey, and Jahan — a proper girl group — hopped off the plane at Fiumicino. This was my first trip to a non English speaking country. I was a struggling actress, fretting over if my hair was too blonde and how I was coming across on camera. Meanwhile, in the background, something exciting was happening. It just didn’t know it yet.
We took a cab into the city (90 euros — which means we got majorly ripped off. This often happens to Americans. Offer 60 Euros and no more!) and arrived at a breathtaking piazza in Trastevere.
There were kids throwing glow circles into the air, there was live music, and hundreds of Romans and tourists alike were dining on the patios of the surrounding restaurants. The piazza was complete with a fountain and an ancient church— the pious statues looking down on the raucous social center with irony. We later found out it was the oldest church in Rome. This would be our home.
Our building in the piazza had a large front window where I’d often sit and stare down in the evening. I was very far from Ohio!

Earlier in 2023, I thought of fulfilling my wanderlust and taking off on a solo trip in Europe — something my younger self wouldn’t have even dreamed of.
In my attempt to live in the present (coupled with my habit of tardily posting photos), I felt it was important to journal my experiences to capture my raw thoughts and feelings while I travel.
I’m glad I wrote them as it took me months to finally get around to sharing my travel stories, but here we go.
1/X: Barcelona, Spain || June 2023
Rome, Italy || July 2023
The day this photo was taken was the day I just did more sight-seeing: revisiting the Trevi Fountain, exploring the Spanish Steps and going around Piazza di Spagna, and marveling at the Pantheon.
I was grateful I didn’t have to take a long time in these places because the reality was that I was feeling anxious, looking for a repair shop that could service an American model of my luggage just a day before I depart for Firenze.
I knew and I’ve been warned it was not the wisest idea to travel by myself to my hand-picked destinations with a big luggage in tow. I still did it anyway, thinking I could somehow have a semblance of home and comfort packed in a suitcase.
That time, I was only a week away from home, but boy, did I feel the most alone.
Traveling is definitely fun, but what we don’t see in photos is how it could invoke some feelings of anxiety too.
I eventually found myself capping the night at Trastevere.
I’m glad I made it well that day. As usual, thanks to the people providing care and support in person and virtually, and for that night, for that rich plate of truffle pasta and a glass of wine to comfort me.
I leave Roma today to transfer to Firenze.
This city captivated me — maybe made me fall in love — during last year’s visit with my family; it’s one of the main reasons why I wanted to return to Italy.
But today I recognize how life continues to surprise us —
like that time I walked through the ruins of the Colosseo and be reminded that I used to wonder about it when I was a child but never deeply dreamed of it because I thought it was impossible to see,
but also I have those times when I’ve been working towards a dream, a desire, and then realizing it may not necessarily be what I want or need.
So here’s a little (self-)reminder: I hope that when things aren’t going how you think they’re supposed to be, open up yourself to the opportunity, and trust that life will continue to surprise you.

Dear friend,
I’m holding a glass of Aperol spritz, and this is the view in front of me. It’s a hot April afternoon in Rome, about 25 degrees. I’m wearing my black dress, feeling the Roman elegance. A slight breeze touches my face.
On the way here, we climbed a hill. There were many people around in their stylish outfits-tourists and Italians. We ascended numerous stairs that seemed to stretch up to the sky. The stairs were made of stone and they were old, like everything in Rome.
After climbing so many stairs, we entered a garden filled with tall trees. There were no tourists here, only Romans. I guess this is one of Rome’s hidden treasures. I only hear Italian being spoken, no other languages.
It’s hot, and the sun is shining directly on my face. I take a sip of my Aperol spritz and feel better. It has ice in it. I take a piece of ice into my mouth and let it cool me down.
The view is spectacular. It takes my breath away. There are so many beautiful buildings in front of me. It feels like sitting in a park with a large balcony in the middle of Rome, admiring the city. Rome knows how to melt your heart; you just have to let it. It is so beautiful, maybe the most beautiful city in the world, at least for me up to now.
There is a big church on my left and a few more on the horizon. Far away, you can see trees blending into the cityscape. The street below curves to the right, with many cars passing by. I take out my sketchbook and start to draw.
Valentine is sitting next to me. I love him a lot, and I’m happy we’re here together. Now he is talking to me about his girlfriend. I like that we’re so open with each other.
Too bad, I finished my drink. The sun is shining intensely, and there are two boys next to us. One of them is shirtless. He reminds me of a character from “Call Me by Your Name.” He looks very young and has a beautiful body like the sculptures in Rome. They’re smoking weed; I can smell it from here.
People around me are speaking Italian. I don’t understand it, but I like it. I think if I were Roman, I would come to this place a lot. And if you were visiting me, I would bring you here.
I know you would like to write your diary here or read your book, maybe Fernando Pessoa’s poems. This place feels like a little escape from the chaos of the city, a spot to sit, relax, and savor Rome.
The place is called Villa Aldobrandini, with the stairs located on Via Mazzarino. I really think you should visit this park. I painted the view for you to find it easily. There is a part of me there, you should visit that place.
Love,
Me

I found this today:
# hosts# Generate standard hosts tables.# Newnet doesn’t really use it, it’s just for easy reference.# Neither does oldnet now, since it’s doing DNS right.#
It lives on line 327 of a Makefile used to build and distribute various configurations around our infrastructure. And it’s old. “How old”, you might ask?
Those lines have been in that file for 19 years. I know that, because I have primary historical evidence, as they say in archaeology.
When I asked about this “oldnet” thing, my boss told me to look up a document, Tenwen: The Re-engineering Of A Computing Environment. It’s a peer reviewed paper from LISA’94 that chronicles the creation of the fabric underlying the network that I administer today.
In the paper, under Fixed Name Service (September 1992):
Once name service was working, we modified the Newnet hosts to do hostname lookups correctly.
This fixed the naming problems for Newnet, but Oldnet was still broken. While we wanted to limit the amount of work we put into Oldnet, we also felt that having name service working correctly could only make it easier to administrate Newnet. We therefore modified Oldnet to use the nameserver on Newnet, and quit using host files on Oldnet as well.
So, those lines date to September, 1992. I was 13 years old.
One time, a couple of weeks after I started working here, one of the other admins asked me what I thought of all of it. The infrastructure, the network, and so on. It took a couple of seconds for me to put my thoughts together, and I said, “Have you ever been to Rome?”
He had, so I continued, “This network is Rome”.
He was confused, understandably, so I explained.
Some networks are like Phoenix, AZ. They’re relatively new and shiny. They’re brought up for the purpose they serve, and for the time in which they exist. There’s not a building in Phoenix over 125 years old. It was built according to relatively modern methods, and the streets are largely laid out in a grid, because there wasn’t a whole lot to get in their way. The city was started from essentially a clean slate.
Some networks, particularly in non-technological companies, are much more like Ephesus in Turkey. Ephesus is amazing…it’s kind of like a metropolis the size of Orlando just got up and left. Seriously, I was there, and it was mind-boggling. It’s almost exactly like it was 1500 years ago. There has been no modern development there, so when you walk through it, you’re in the midst of miles of ruins.
Rome, on the other hand, is a different sort of beast. Romulus founded the City of Seven Hills 2,500 years old, if you believe the legends, and it has been occupied for pretty much the entire time since. When you climb out of an underground Metro station full of artifacts excavated while digging the subway tunnels you just left, you may find yourself facing an Roman gladiatorial arena turned into a Catholic church. The modern Rome grew up out of the old, and there’s a continual architectural history of the past 2500 years waiting on you to find it.
It’s the exact same way here on this network. The new Windows desktop infrastructure runs smoothly alongside the host database mentioned in the paper above, written 20 years ago. It relies on the host database, actually. Like Rome’s streets, sewer, viaducts, and aquaducts, these antique systems were vital to the time, and if they aren’t still in use, they paved the way for the modern systems that replaced them.
Being someone who likes archaeology, antiquities, and old libraries and junk stores, working here is a pleasure, because there’s always something new to discover, and like I did today, a rich history behind it.

Everywhere I turned in Rome, there were overwhelmingly inspiring sights, but they were overrun by tourists, myself included. All week, I purposely was getting off the beaten path, scouring the city for places away from the tourist crowds. I find it hard to fully enjoy Rome with the constant crush of tourists everywhere I turn.
This Sunday, however, dawned differently. A strange quiet settled over the city. No honking horns, no chattering crowds, just the gentle gurgling of the Tiber River as I walked along its banks. I’d gotten up much earlier than usual, setting out on a walk from my Vatican City apartment to Trastevere, a charming neighbourhood in Rome.
The river’s curvy ribbon unfolded before me, its surface a polished mirror reflecting the soft glow of the awakening sun. Crossing the Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II, a bridge of pale stone and impressive arches, I paused to admire the view. Soft pastel colours, like scoops of gelato, washed over the city — a sea of terracotta rooftops dotted with church domes. Rome is a scene straight out of a postcard.
I relish the quietness of the city, broken only by the rhythmic pounding of lone runners and the occasional flash of brightly coloured bikes zipping past me. Sticking to the eastern side of the river, I watched the city slowly stir to life.
Reaching Ponte Garibaldi, I took in the panorama again. This vantage point revealed how far I’d wandered, with St. Peter’s Basilica’s dome just a distant peak. In front of me, a tiny emerald oasis emerged from the river — Tiber Island. A bright orange building, like a giant creamsicle, stood at its tip. (This is the hospital, by the way!)
Two bridges connect Tiber Island. Ponte Fabricio, the oldest bridge in Rome, stood strong with its thick stone arches from 62 BC. Beside it, Ponte Cestio is adorned with three graceful arches. Crossing over, I am greeted by the tourist-favourite Trastevere neighbourhood.
Trastevere was just waking up. Street cleaners swept away the remnants of Saturday night’s partying. Trucks rumbled by, collecting overflowing bins. Storefronts remained shuttered, and chairs and tables stacked high are starting to be dismantled setting up for Sunday lunch. It’s a neighbourhood waking and preparing for a new day’s performance.
Wandering through Trastevere’s narrow streets, I admired its unique beauty. Peeling paint, colourful graffiti, overflowing flower boxes, ivy climbing the walls, and laundry strung cheerfully across the balconies — even the “rundown” parts held a charm.
Reaching the tall stone archway, Porta Portese, I entered the famed Sunday flea market. But the peaceful bliss of my morning walk vanished instantly. Chaos engulfed me — shouts, haggling, and mountains of stuff piled everywhere. It was a stark contrast to the serenity I’d enjoyed just hours earlier.
Later that day, nestled in a cozy Trastevere trattoria buzzing with Sunday family lunch, I savoured my delicious cacio e pepe. The quiet morning walk solidified a travel revelation for me: waking up early unlocks a hidden side of the city.
For anyone who truly wants to experience a place, especially one as busy as Rome, consider rising with the sun. Early mornings offer a rare moment of tranquillity, allowing for a deeper connection to a city.
Even if you’re not a morning person, dedicate one day on your trip to this slow travel approach. You might be surprised by the magic you discover in the quietness of the city.

Rome is home to many churches and religious sites. Catholicism has deep-seated roots in the city, which is made even more apparent since the city is home to the pope.
I visited the city last month with some students on my first Spring Break tour. Part of the tour was a three-day stay in Rome. We visited the Vatican and the Colosseum and even took a day trip to visit Pompeii. The city is filled with piazzas and pizzas at every turn. Rome breathes history; if you can get away from the crowds.
This year, Rome was crowded a bit more than usual due to the Jubilee celebration. We often found ourselves working our way through busy crowds of fellow visitors, trying to take a photo at some of the most well-known sites.
Still, we found ourselves able to enjoy the city with its plazas and shops. One thing to remember about Italy is that they are not in a hurry like Americans tend to be. If you sit down at a cafe for lunch, expect to be there for an hour at least. Enjoy your meal, and maybe a nice glass of Italian wine.
If you visit Rome, try to find places that are less well-known to tourists. Yes, we saw the Trevi Fountain, the Colliseum, and the Forum. And while these places are amazing and worth spending time in, there are plenty of places in…

If you had been strolling down Corso Vittorio Emanuele in Rome among the many exclusive shops and charming sidewalk cafes on a sunny Sunday afternoon a few years ago, you might have seen eight well-dressed, middle-aged-to-elderly people slugging, kicking, cursing, and wrestling each other on the sidewalk, as a small crowd looked on.
Utterly unprepared for a street brawl, four American tourists and an Italian family sprang into what can only be called clumsy, slapstick, stop-the-chaos-at-any-cost, WHAT-THE-F*CK?!, schoolyard defense mode.
I know because I was one of them.
Until then, it had been a relaxing Italian vacation with my close friends Jenny and Doug, and my (now ex-)wife. We had traveled to Rome to attend the wedding of some friends and had spent the subsequent couple of weeks touring around Italy together on holiday.
We’d had a wonderful time driving aimlessly around in a toy-size rental car playing archeologists to Italy’s hieroglyphic road signs.
We’d marveled at paintings of naked people and mythological heroes in museums and did all we could to assist the natives in their efforts to vanquish the copious amounts of red wine and pasta the country…

“Take the first steps in faith. You do not have to see the whole staircase.” Martin Luther King Jr.
The Spanish Steps are one of the most recognizable places in the Eternal City. This place became popular long before the advent of mass tourism. At the beginning of the 16th century, the first hotels were built here, and in the 17th century, Spain acquired the Monaldeschi Palace and turned the building into an embassy. From that moment on, the square began to be called Spanish.
The stairs were paid for by a French diplomat, Étienne Gueffier, who thought it would be a great idea to connect The Spanish Square Piazza di Spagna to the French Santissima Trinita dei Monti church as a symbol of unity between Spain and France.
Did you ever count the steps by running up and down the stairs? I counted 270 steps during my round trip from the street level to the top and back — until a local policeman, carabinieri, tried to stop me.
They could not catch up and yelled at me not to run up the stairs. I giggled like a schoolgirl caught running by a principal.
As I ran the stairs, I remembered Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck sitting together on the Spanish Steps in their movie Roman Holiday. Watching Hollywood movies was how I learned European geography as a little girl.

An Ancient Roman aristocrat would surely feel proud that 2,000 years later, Rome still looms large in the Western consciousness as the greatest empire that ever was. Careers have been built on studying why Rome fell, and even the general public has heard some of the proposals: was it immigration, horse-back barbarians, Christianity, inflation, dependency on slaves, the decadence of the elites, or perhaps even lead poisoning?
We care about this mostly because we see Ancient Rome as a mirror of modern empires, especially the US. If Rome fell because of barbarian hordes, then surely that means America must kick out all the Mexicans or else it will suffer the same fate! … Right?
Today, I will be putting my ancient history degree to use by writing not about why Rome fell, but about the even more thorny topic of when it fell (if we can even pinpoint a date). You learn very different lessons about its decline depending on whether you feel that Rome fell in 330 AD, 395 AD, 476 AD, 565 AD, 1453 AD, 27 BC or even 105 BC. Which of these was the “real” date has a lot to do with how you define “Roman-ness” — a tougher topic than it seems.

After experiencing my Venetian Dream and enjoying the sunsets of Florence, all roads lead me to Rome. And here I am…
Yet, it seemed Rome wasn’t so happy to see me. I went to the hotel and found out this wasn’t my hotel. Seems like there are 4 hotels with the same names or similar, and my map showed me the most-rated one. So I booked a hotel just by checking its name on the map without double checking the address and… My hotel is somewhere else… OK, not funny, but first, let’s find it.
It wasn’t super easy, but I like challenges. I found the hotel, and checked in, and I didn’t have the energy to go on. Usually, I book a hotel near the sites I want to visit. This helps me not to waste time and energy on transportation. Now my hotel isn’t in the place I thought and… In one word—stressful.
Okay! I just had a little rest and went out very hungry. I decided to eat carbonara and went to the nearest restaurant to my hotel. The pasta was very salty. Okay, Rome doesn’t like me.
Still tired and stressed, disappointed with Rome, I started walking, and in about 15 minutes I appeared near the Colosseum. Seems like my hotel wasn’t so far away. Maybe everything isn’t so bad, haha…
Colosseum — the first World Wonder my eyes saw!
It’s huge and impressive. I was walking around and going back through history. This is the largest amphitheater ever built, and it is still standing, despite its age. This is a great achievement in ancient architecture. Really significant… but I’ll speak more later, as this was just the first meeting and I was going to see this wonder every day.
Rome is rich with fountains. You can see these water sources in every square. For instance, another beautiful fountain is located in the Piazza Navona—the Fiumi Fountains. Yet, the pearl of the Roman fountains remains Trevi Fountains. I walked there and understood that this fountain was meant to become one of my favorite spots in Rome.
Trevi fountains are huge and significant. And, of course, overcrowded. I loved it a lot—the architecture and especially its symbolism.
It was built as a water source for the city and constructed in travertine stone—the same material as the Colosseum. The magnificent view and stone decorations we see today were done in the late 18th century, commissioned by Pope Clement XII, who wanted to showcase the power and influence of the Catholic Church in Rome.
You may know that people throw coins into the water. The first and most well-known reason is based on local lore: it will bring you back to Rome again someday. Yet, some people do it hoping to find love or romance while in Rome and to marry there happily. And they say that each wish requires its own coin. As for me, I just enjoyed the magnificence of the fountains.
Rome is Rome, and there’s anything to see, whatever corner you step into. I was just walking around and appearing in another beautiful and historical place to enjoy. Piazza Navona was one of them—a nice square where you may just have a break, sit on a bench, and enjoy the weather, and how Roman people live their daily lives, how tourists react, and so on—lots of emotions and feelings.
The Spanish Steps is another favorite site in Rome. The view from the top is very beautiful, and walking up is another way to discover the lifestyle in Rome. It all began when the French wanted to create a symbolic connection between France and Spain in Rome. Spanish Steps was given to the world to connect Trinità dei Monti church, owned by the French, to the Piazza di Spagna, named for the Bourbon Spanish Embassy that stood alongside it.
Quirinal Palace is another square and another historical building in Rome. This is the home of the president of Italy. They say that it is possible to have a guided tour of this building in Italian language. So, if you’re interested in where the Italian president lives and you’re okay with the Italian language, book a tour.
The next square you may easily appear in is the Piazza del Popolo. Here you will see the Twin Churches and fountains. I loved the idea of having such churches.
And if you walk up, you’ll appear at a viewpoint from which you can see the square and a beautiful view of the city as well. It is worth waiting for a sunset there.
Of course, I couldn’t be in Rome and not find an Armenian site. This time it was San Biagio degli Armeni—the national church of the Armenian community in Rome. The church is frequently recorded in medieval catalogs. It originated before the 10th century but was first recorded in a 1072 inscription preserved inside it.
I read that there’s Armenian liturgy on some days of the week. Unfortunately, when I went, there was a nun who was praying, and I didn’t want to disturb her. I would like to talk to somebody and try to learn more about this Armenian piece, but it wasn’t meant to be.
I met the Colosseum every morning and evening, but of course, I couldn’t miss my chance to enter this masterpiece and see the ancient history, architecture, and culture. I had booked a tour in advance, and it was one of the best things I did. First of all, let me tell you, the guides are very enthusiastic and funny, and they help you understand everything better. My tour started with the Roman Forum.
I learned a lot about Roman history when I visited the Roman Forum, surrounded by the ruins of several important ancient government buildings at the center of Rome. Here you may see even a few columns of an early building, and it’s so lovely how Italians preserve their history and ancient heritage.
These days, the Forum is part of the Parco Archeologico del Colosseo.
After exploring the Forum, my group was guided to the Colosseum. This amphitheater has three levels of arches around the outside. In height, the Colosseum was as tall as a modern 12-story building; it held 50,000 spectators.
When I entered, I saw that the walls were darker from the inside. They say that in ancient times, when there weren’t lights, people had to use torches when going inside, even during the day. This ancient giant is even greater from the inside. It was a very interesting experience to see the arena floor and imagine gladiators fighting.
When looking closer at the walls, you can see that the building has many holes that resemble Swiss cheese. The guide explained that the massive travertine blocks that make up the outer wall were not stuck together with mortar or cement, as you might expect. Instead, they used iron clamps. And after successive Barbarian invasions, iron had become very valuable. The Romans gouged out the plaster covering the iron, pulled it out, and used it for various purposes (mostly weaponry). I read somewhere that it is estimated that over 300 tons of iron were removed from the building, leaving it pockmarked as it is today.
In any case, Romans know how to preserve their history and historical heritage. There was even a few meters of the ancient floor outside the Colosseum that they enclosed so that people don’t walk on it.
I’ve always used to say that my eyes are blessed to see this world and its wonders. But in Rome, it became even more practical.
As the Colosseum was the nearest spot to my hotel, every morning I was passing by it. It was probably my second morning there when Viktor Hladchenko approached me and asked to take a photo of my eye reflecting the Colosseum. I leave it to your judgment.
Don’t you think I’m lucky? I do.
I forgot to tell you that wherever I was walking in Rome, the dome of Saint Peter Basilica was visible.
And finally, that day came when I visited the Vatican—the smallest country in the world. This isn’t a joke; imagine that this small territory is a separate country inside the city of Rome. It has everything: a passport system, license plates, a post office, a flag, a telephone system, and a radio station. The Pope himself heads the state, and every year, over 6 million tourists visit Vatican Museums.
This small country has great significance in the Christian world. And being an Armenian (the first nation that adopted Christianity as a state religion in 301), as well as being a museum lover, I was waiting for this day. Unfortunately, I wasn’t lucky enough to see the Pope… haha…
I spent 5 hours wandering in the Vatican Museum, Sistine Chapel, and Saint Peter’s Basilica. And I was impressed. However, the most significant for me was the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Here, I understood why it isn’t allowed to take photos there. No photo may express what my eyes saw, even a little similar to that. The ceiling is live, and all the figures and creatures are real, and sometimes it even seems they’re moving… This is a real masterpiece, and it is worth spending hours looking up at the ceilings, even if your neck already kills.
I also had a chance to see the dome of Saint Peter’s Basilica from one of the best possible angles, where the windows and the dome are wholly visible. It’s not possible to see it from the front side.
The inside of the church is impressive as well. It’s really huge, especially for me, as I am used to small Armenian churches with humble church architecture without so many colors. Imagine how tired I would be after walking so long and getting so much information and emotion. And that wasn’t enough. I went out of the basilica and looked up instinctively (because you need to look up in order not to miss), and you guess what?
In front of me on the wall of Saint Peter’s Basilica, there was a statue of St. Gregory the Illuminator—the Armenian Saint, thanks to whom Armenians adopted Christianity.
I saw the Armenian letters and thought I was so tired I had an illusion. But no, it was real, and you can see it when you visit the basilica.
After a tiring and informative day in Vatican City, I was very tired and tasty. So, I decided to walk to the Trastevere neighborhood to eat something. This part of Rome is well-known for its bars and restaurants. There is an interesting atmosphere and, of course, tasty dishes.
Trastevere is colorful, with many people sitting inside and outside restaurants, enjoying their Roman experience. I like this neighborhood and recommend going there even if you don’t want to eat; just enjoy the narrow streets, color, and atmosphere.
As I’ve already mentioned, I tried a salty Carbonara during my first day in Rome. But I never give up. I gave another chance to this pasta, which originated in Rome. I tried it once more in another restaurant (unfortunately, I don’t remember the name), and it was super delicious. I loved Romanian Carbonara.
In Trastevere, I tried another pasta originating in Rome—Cacio e Pepe (Spaghetti with Cheese and Pepper). This is a simple but very delicious pasta to try when you are in Rome. It was great.
To make the long story short, I loved Italian pasta.
I spent 4 full days in Rome and I think that’s enough to explore the city for your first visit.
I went to the hotel in the evening (by the way, as my hotel wasn’t in a walking area from everywhere I was going, I used buses to go back to the hotel). Of course, after enjoying the best tiramisu in my life and with the best view. I couldn’t leave Rome without saying “See you soon” to the Trevi fountains. Btw, do not miss this spot at night as well.
OK! Let’s come back. My flight was early in the morning (about 6 AM), and I had to arrive at the airport at night. Somehow scary, isn’t it? Okay, it wasn’t until it became.
No buses, no trains; I only have one option—a taxi. A friend told me I could use Uber. I tried earlier, and it showed some cars nearby, but when the time came and I tried to request a ride, it didn’t work. Okay, it was about 2 AM; I needed to go to the airport, and I didn’t know how. Then it was scary.
I went out of the hotel, walked for about 10 minutes, and saw some people. At first, I was scared to approach them, but I realized I didn’t have another chance. So, I asked them for help. Fortunately, they were very kind and willing to help me. It wasn’t easy to find a taxi for them as well. They called some services, tried some applications, and managed to find one for me. I’m so thankful to these people. If you read me, guys, write to me. I’ll be happy to help you whenever you’re in Armenia.
I love Rome!
I love people in Rome. I love the Italian way of enjoying life. And I love the idea of living in Rome for a few months. For me, Rome is a middle-aged man who is smart inside and who also cares about his look and appearance. He’s well-trained and wearing a classic outfit—a dark blue suit and white shirt with a tie, probably. And maybe he is riding a motorcycle.
Of the 3 Italian cities I lived in, I go for Rome. Okay, Venice is unique and special—a real dream of magic; Florence is cozy and cultural—with breathtaking views; but Rome is Rome—ancient but aesthetic, historical but fictional, architectural, sweet, and lovely. I loved the vibe in Rome. Rome is closer to my soul. It’s like me—romantic and real!
I love Italy 🖤

By now, all my friends know how obsessed with Ancient Roman history I am — if the Hadrian necklace around my neck wasn’t a major indicator, my Facebook wall is covered in memes about Julius Caesar’s stabbing and the gayness of Ancient Greeks. I don’t see how everyone isn’t googly-eyed about Trajan’s conquests in Dacia or the way Romans engineered their Forum.
But as my sister so eloquently said in Barnes&Noble, as I was crouched down at the ancient history section, “It’s just a bunch of dead guys.” Incorrect! The Gallic Wars by Julius Caesar, Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, and the speeches and private letters of Cicero create a breathing, amorphous view of Ancient Rome as the Romans lived it. They’re crumbling now, but it’s so easy to get into Rome when you hear them speaking to you. Here are a few ways to submerse yourself in Ancient culture without wasting money on classes or feeling like an anachronistic nitwit — because the Ancient do matter, and they were pretty wild.
Although a painfully in-depth history of Rome isn’t necessary, it does make understanding memes easier and dropping highfalutin facts at parties a treat. After I visited Rome for the first time, I flocked to the internet, looking for anything to teach me ancient history. I stumbled on this podcast, The History of Rome by Mike Duncan, which was a five-year project detailing the early years of the Roman kingdoms to its ignominious fall in 476 CE. 189 episodes of wry humor, encyclopedic facts, and anecdotes testifying to the gore of Rome, the series is thick but enjoyable. 14-year-old Mackenzie lived for this podcast, scrawling little notes in a dark bedroom (this is only half exaggeration). Although this fascination only heightened my social ineptness, I learned so much (too much) about dead guys.
2. Join the Ancient Roman Meme Pages
Browse a few Facebook meme pages, and you’ll have working knowledge of the big kahunas of ancient history. My top two pages are Roman SPQRposting and Rough Roman Memes — the former is crass and attaches names like Julius Caesar and Seneca to PornHub screenshots, but it’s so hilarious. My social media walls are a running joke, with all my friends knowing me as the Ancient Meme girl. But beyond the porn and Elon Musk memes, history is explained and jabbed at. It forces users to research memes they don’t understand (i.e. What happened at the Teutoburg Forest? What does the two walls of The Battle of Alesia mean?) This subculture of meme trolls is highly educated and highly derisive, with people posting revisions to already revised memes in the comments. Also, I just saw someone post 50 shades of Alcibiades, and I am done.
3. Brush Up on Ancient Roman TV and Movie Adaptations
Russell Crowe isn’t the apex of Roman history, but at least his attractiveness seduces people into the ancient history genre. Netflix has 5+ smarmy shows about Rome, although the HBO ROME series is the most salacious and salient of them all. And we can’t forget I, Claudius, that 1970s BBC show that was weirdly great despite the multiple incest and boob scenes. It’s important to take these shows with a granary of salt (get it?). While they are dramatic and make everything seem neatly cut and sequential, Ancient Rome wasn’t easy to follow — communication between armies took weeks or months and it’s easy to focus on megalomaniacal Emperors instead of the reams of “normal” Roman citizens.
As for movie adaptations, I would watch the 70s/80s movies that are as cringy as they are wholesome. Ben Hur, Quo Vadis, and Monty Python’s Life of Brian aren’t 100% accurate, but they uncork a lifetime so foreign to us today. Yeah, that lifetime is badly CGI-ed and filled with tan, blue-eyed men with chin dimples, but it gets us thinking about the Romans nonetheless.
4. Hit the {Serious} Books
Nothing beats a primary-source literature bath. To understand the Romans, one must read their words, marvel at the mosaics they left behind, see their skeleton structures. The Aeneid is nice & historical, but I’m talking about the meatier works — Julius Caesar’s Gallic Wars, the satire of Petronius, the personal letters that Cicero wrote to enemies, friends, and lovers (thanks for the inspiration, Mary Beard). A culture can be expressed through characters, and Mary Beard makes that evident in her Meet the Romans BBC series — reading the gravestones of imperial hairdressers, gladiators, and wine makers, she recreated life from thousands of years ago.
Besides primary sources, a Roman history dilettante should read seminal writings and critiques written in the last few centuries. The prime example of this is, of course, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon. Six volumes and published in the late 1700s, it discusses the reasons why Rome deteriorated, most notably by Christianity. A more recent *must read* is SPQR by my favorite intellectual, Mary Beard. Her first chapter situates readers in 63 BCE, during the throws of the Catiline Conspiracy and the Ciceronian executions — what a climax in the first few pages! I’m currently reading that book now, although I also have my eye on Resurrecting the Granary of Rome: Environmental History and French Colonial Expansion in North Africa.
5. Deck Yourself Out in Roman Jewelry
This isn’t strictly necessary (yes, I’ve said this before), but bejeweling your collarbone in Ancient denarius, a Roman currency, looks and feels like royalty. I bought a faded denarius with Hadrian’s profile from Civitas, an online coin dealer — it was only $50, so here’s to hoping it’s not a fake. Fitting the coin into a bezel (a plated ring the coin slips into), I then found a spare chain and aha! Now the Romans are literally close to my heart all the time. Forever 21 also sells bracelets made of fake gold ancient coins — it’s not the most savory or classy accessory, but I appreciate the nod to our forebears.
6. Adopt a Roman Diet for a Week
I’m not an expert on regular Roman diets, but I know it included a f*ck ton of grain, diluted wine, and homemade fish sauce spread on everything (in Latin, garum). By contrast, the rich ate lavishly, supplementing their goblets with fruits, cheese, rare meats (i.e. flamingo, duck, hare, snails), and lots of fish — it didn’t include any of the processed nonsense our palettes are used to.
As part of an upcoming Spoon article, I’m going to eat religiously Roman for a week — my mother just handed me a bottle of Portuguesier (a sweeter merlot), so let’s start this Bacchanalia. The oldest surviving cookbook in history, Cookery and Dining in Imperial Rome by Apicius, dates back to Ancient Rome. It describes in detail the opulence of Roman tongues and the food which modern people would consider gross and exotic — fish balls? Boiled ostrich? Ragout of brains anyone? I couldn’t eat those foods for a week, but I’m THRILLED about the plebeian alcohol and carbs.
7. Listen to Roman Music (aka the Lyre)
For all the audio learners out there, listening to traditional Roman music can set the SPQR mood. Roman music was heavily dependent on the lyre, a stringed instrument from classical Greece. Resembling the harp, it makes the listener simultaneously snoozed and hypnotized — it’s the music of cults, sounds of the Villa of the Mysteries. Music was traditionally played during funerals, although contrary to the popular phrase “Nero fiddled while Rome burned,” the fiddle was not around in Roman days. According to the History Channel, the Romans had the cithara (a wooden, stringed instrument) and the double-reeded aulos (the ancient version of the oboe). YouTube has several videos of European professors playing these outdated instruments, as well as the music of Michael Levy, a master lyre musician.
8. Watch Mary Beard Lectures on YouTube
My! Lady! I’ve already mentioned Mary Beard multiple times, but she’s truly an intellectual to be admired, praised, and learned from — her brain is impressive, but it’s her edge and distaste for sugar-coating that gets me. She’s a professor at Cambridge, author of several history books, a debater against Boris Johnson for Christ sakes, and yet she still says “bloody hell” during lectures! Any lady that can combine intellect with tongue-and-cheek is my kind of woman.
Her words fuse the modern and the ancient, the lascivious and high-brow. Watch her series Meet the Romans, take notes on her lectures about Women in Power, or marvel as she discusses portraits of Augustus. My early-morning routine includes boiling peppermint tea and fangirling over her excitement for the Romans. For Mary, the Romans aren’t crumbling headstones on the Appian way — they’re accessible if we read (or translate) close enough.
9. Travel to Rome
This tip seems obvious, but it’s difficult to grow an obsession without any substance. Walking in the Forum, seeing cats slink in the Largo di Torre Argentina (the square where Caesar was stabbed), or watching indigo skies through the Pantheon oculus is so much substance. Running into a literal brick wall of history is more affecting than listening to a podcast. There’s nothing like sticky hands after eating gelato outside the Circo Massimo. Dragging unwilling parents to Ostia Antica (an ancient port) is my idea of fun. I only became interested in Rome after traveling there — I didn’t know anything about ancient history; I just wanted to gorge on gelato and pizza. But the spell of the city creeps, like a mono contagion, overwhelming and all-consuming until you’re sitting in a closet scribbling notes about Nero. Or maybe that’s just me.
Hopefully this guide inspires readers to a) fly to Rome and/or b) hold the Ancients in a higher regard. Although we’re separated by 2,000 years, aspects of life like love, sex, food shortages, civil war, and satirical literature are familiar, both striking and unexpected. I will never stop being amazed by these humans, people I will never meet. I can read their poems, recreate their music, and steal little rock fragments from their remaining monuments — and yet they’re dead with nothing but epitaphs left. But despite dust and Latin separating us, they’re so close. Nothing unfamiliar about it.

Men cannot stop thinking about the Roman Empire. Viral social media posts and news outlets from The Guardian to Italy’s La Repubblica have all suggested that men are obsessed with Rome. Memes abound. Rome apparently crosses the minds of men anywhere from a few times a month to a few times a day! Rome remains a cultural touchstone, and that probably won’t change. Ancient history books remain best sellers; films like Gladiator or Ben-Hur are award-winning classics; Rome and Pompeii, as I saw firsthand this summer, are as crowded as ever.
As a scholar of Italian humanism, I spend a significant amount of time in Rome and I write about men who think about Rome. While I don’t find this phenomenon surprising, I believe it is problematic...and that’s because Rome is often equated with concepts like “Europe,” “Western Civilization,” and “whiteness.” No, the Romans were not white — whiteness as a marker of racial difference didn’t exist in antiquity. Romans weren’t even just from Italy or Europe. There were numerous Roman writers from Africa; the emperor Septimius Severus (145–211) was born in modern-day Libya; and Augustine of Hippo (354–430), a theologian whose works are central to Western Christianity, was from modern-day Algeria. But the Romans have been made white because white people — mostly men — have linked the Roman past to themselves.
Petrarch (1304–1374), whom we often problematically call the “Father of the Renaissance,” wrote letters to ancient figures like Cicero and Homer. After visiting Rome for the first time in 1337, he wrote “who can doubt that Rome will rise up again once she begins to recognize herself?” But what is the “self” Petrarch hoped Rome would recognize? Petrarch was writing after the Crusades and during the rise of the Ottomans and the papacy’s relocation to Avignon, France. This geopolitical reality led Petrarch to believe that Europeans must revive Rome and end the Middle or Dark Ages, which for him meant everything Rome was not and everything we should resist: backwardness, barbarism, unfettered violence, lack of culture.
Petrarch wasn’t alone. Humanists like Poggio Bracciolini (1380–1459) scoured libraries and monasteries for ancient texts. In his On the Vicissitudes of Fortune, Bracciolini used the ruins of the Roman Forum to wax philosophical on how far European society had fallen. Lorenzo Valla (1406–1457) believed the barbarians who destroyed Rome corrupted the purity of Latin; the result was Italian, which was called volgare. Biondo Flavio (1392–1463) called for restoring the Forum and Colosseum so they could be centerpieces in victory parades against Europe’s Muslim enemies, similar to ancient triumphs. Cyriac of Ancona (1391–1452) wrote about invading the Ottoman Empire to reclaim antiquities from Islam.
This preoccupation with the Romans as the forefathers of Western Civilization continued beyond Italian humanists as Europeans began building global empires. In two important essays in The New Centennial Review and Boundary 2, Sylvia Wynter shows how debates on the humanity of both Indigenous peoples and enslaved Africans centered on their perceived distance from Rome. Roman civilization’s purported Europeanness thus became justification for Indigenous genocide, mass African enslavement, and colonialism.
As their empires grew, Europeans constantly invoked Rome to prove white supremacy. In the eighteenth century, the Grand Tour — an educational journey that terminated in Rome or Naples — became an important way for wealthy Europeans and Americans to see themselves as the heirs of Rome. While in Italy, Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717–68), clearly unaware of ancient polychromy, saw the whiteness of Roman sculpture, including copies of Greek originals, as proof of European racial supremacy. As the historian Nell Irvin Painter argues, “Winckelmann elevated Rome’s white marble copies of Greek statuary into emblems of beauty and created a new white aesthetic.”
Winckelmann’s contemporary, Edward Gibbon (1737–1794), saw Rome as a moral lesson for contemporary Britain. In his History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Gibbon argued that the Roman Empire fell due to a lack of civic virtue and the onset of barbarism, i.e., foreign invasions. His now famous motivation from his memoir for writing captures the essence of white men thinking about Rome: “It was at Rome, on the 15th of October, 1764, as I sat musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol, while the barefooted friars were singing vespers in the Temple of Jupiter, that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the city first started to my mind.”
This linkage between Ancient Rome, imperialism, and white supremacy informed the new American Republic and how Europeans ran their empires. The Founders were obsessed with Rome and Greece, often citing ancient authors in their debates of what the United States would look like. This use of classically-inspired architecture, which has a long history, also appeared in Washington, D.C., plantations across the American South, and scores of other structures, linking the United States to Ancient Rome. As Lyra D. Monteiro shows, this neoclassical obsession is grounded in a racially-exclusive vision of the ancient past used to justify American settler colonialism, slavery, and white supremacy. Similarly, in European empires across the globe, perhaps most notably Britain’s, visions of empire and white supremacy have been mediated through antiquity. In French colonial North Africa, agricultural planning was based not on environmental realities, but on French attempts to revive North Africa as Rome’s breadbasket. Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy also put antiquity front and center in their supremacist ideologies.
Since Petrarch, the study of Rome has been tied to imperialism and white supremacy. We have to confront this reality and find new ways to show that the study of Rome need not be a project of whiteness or simply a passive exercise in drawing parallels between our world and theirs simply because we see ourselves in the Romans. It’s important to remember, as Keith Hopkins quipped, “Romans were dangerously different.”
But as teacher-scholars of antiquity and its reception, we face an uphill battle on two fronts. First is the belief that studying the past against the grain of whiteness is an attack on Western Civilization, which, as Kwame Anthony Appiah reminds us, doesn’t even exist. The School Choice Movement and the Classical Learning Test aim to shield students from a more critical study of the past, opting to celebrate antiquity as the font of Western Civilization. They want us to think more about Rome. I love Rome. Having spent a significant part of my life there, I am immersed in the practice...but how we think about Rome is where the problem lies.
The other battle is the increased neoliberalization of higher education and the shift toward job training and more “relevant” and presentist topics, even within the humanities. At the time of writing, there are only twenty-nine tenure track searches in classics nationwide. Ancient history and premodern history in general — where classical reception emerges — are faring far worse. According to the American Historical Association, only thirty-seven (about 8%) of all full-time history positions in 2022–23, both tenure track and non-tenure track, were in premodern history.
But if people are thinking about Rome every day, then it’s clearly relevant. Therefore, we should invest in research and teaching about Rome, its impact, and its reception in ways that change the narrative about its meaning. To be sure, scholars in ancient studies as well as in premodern critical race studies have been working hard to detach views of Ancient Rome from white supremacy. For example, two recent special volumes of the American Journal of Philology have tackled the legacy of white supremacy in the study of ancient literature. And I think there is an opportunity to capture the attention of students who think about Rome. I mean, who doesn’t want students who think about the topic of their class daily?! Courses on Greece and Rome are very popular, and my Renaissance class usually fills within twenty-four hours. When I take undergraduates to Rome, they are blown away by the heterogeneity of the city’s people, food, art, and history.
Because this pervasive white supremacist image of Rome doesn’t actually reflect any truth about the Roman Empire and its impact on the world, we have a responsibility as scholars and teachers to cultivate a deeper understanding of Rome in all its diversity and richness. It’s a job for all of us — from classicists to modernists and everyone in between — to help students abandon simplistic and often racist views of Rome and instead see its complexities, contradictions, and nuances. And thinking about that Rome every day is never a bad thing.

I think about Rome all the time. Specifically, I think about the big-budget HBO drama Rome that ran from 2005–2007. That magnificent series was a richly realized historical epic that mixed sex and violence and back-stabbing political intrigue and served as a blueprint for the mega-hit series Game of Thrones, which was vastly inferior to its prototype in every way.
Rome was a show about power, loyalty, and betrayal set against the greatest empire in human history. Game of Thrones was lots of drinking from goblets, whispering secrets and dragons, and other childish bullshit. Game of Thrones was great fun, but it was always a naughty fairytale for adults.
Rome, on the other hand, explored big themes like ambition, love, and nudity.
I’m not the only person who thinks about Rome… and Rome. According to a recent social media trend, men think about Rome daily. The hashtag #RomanEmpire leads to videos with millions of views of women asking the men in their lives if they think about Rome and the men usually say “yes.” Let’s agree that social media trends are usually short-lived, superficial call-and-response games where someone, somewhere, posts an opinion or a hot take and then the entire internet, a…

How to slow down on your post-Pandemic trip to Rome. Do not rush to the famous sites, because the city has plenty of hidden, underrated monuments that give you an equal — and sometimes a better — taste of Roman art and history.
I n June 2021, Italy opened its borders to tourists from a range of countries, including the U.S., and allowed the vaccinated arrivals to skip quarantine. Soon afterward, I flew straight into Rome because after all, who knows how long the window of opportunity may last. After eighteen months without an international trip, I walked out of my guesthouse at Piazza di Spagna and began staggering around the hot streets of Rome, not knowing how to travel anymore. Should I immediately start taking photos as usual, or should I run to the Colosseum just to cross an item off a list? The confusion began to feel like a hangover after a long delirium. The kind of hangover that makes you want to start a new life. And with that, I made a decision — no return to the pre-Pandemic way of traveling; no hunt for pictures that are considered iconic; no visiting of the famous sites, or at least, not only the famous sites. I was in Rome, and I was craving to feel it, explore it, and learn from it. But how to turn the lofty sentiment into reality? Maybe by turning the trip into a search for hidden Rome, as I began to call the most underrated places in the city.
Just as it seems that luck begins to favor you as soon as you make the right decision, I quickly found out about another recent opening in Rome; one that received much less attention, but would let me step under the surface of the city — literally. On June 23, 2021, for the first time after many years, members of the public could enter Domus Aurea, the ancient palace of Emperor Nero. This could be my first foray into the realm of hidden Rome. For a reason unclear at first, however, the advertisement for the tour featured Raphael as well.
Traveling in the time of the pandemic
The walk to the palace leads around the Colosseum, where I reluctantly paused to take a picture after all. But while I was doing that, there was an unusual sound — the sound of the Italian language. Who would expect so much Italian at prominent tourist sites? Well, that was the Pandemic Rome. It is too soon to have meaningful figures, but my eyes estimated that the tourist numbers were at about a half of the pre-pandemic level, a rough figure in line with taxi drivers’ experiences, restaurant occupancy, and affordable hotel prices, even in the most central locations. Crucially, however, the new visitor demographics included much fewer inter-continental arrivals and somewhat more domestic ones, which created an atmosphere very different from from the 2010s, the decade of the world tourism explosion.
If you assume that having fewer visitors around means easier access into the Colosseum or the Vatican, you will be sorely mistaken. Yes, pandemic rules reduced the tourist figures, but they also limited the numbers of admissions into museums, galleries, St. Peter’s Basilica, and all the sites. Since the operation of some ticket offices was restricted as well, the most efficient way to see Rome in 2021 is to book all visits and tours online, at least several days in advance —as before the pandemic.
Narcissist’s house
At Domus Aurea, I joined a small group, and we were greeted by our guide Marcella because the only way to visit the palace is with a guided tour, provided in English as well as in Italian. Marcella is an archeologist, who worked directly on excavations of the elusive structure. She had a joy in her eyes, with the rest of her face behind a mask, when she saw us. She explained: “We have been restoring the palace for a long time — we have even excavated new rooms that no one had ever seen before. But then, there were no people to see it! So, it’s great to finally show our work to someone.” And with that, our group stepped into a large tunnel leading into the Esquiline Hill.
Since Domus Aurea lies underground now, the temperature hovers around 10ºC (50ºF). Soon, some fellow visitors began to put on sweaters. New lamps, installed during the period of closure, produced only a dim light for esthetic and conservation reasons. I had zero right to complain; this was my new way to see Rome, with the cold air of the city’s soil on my skin and limited opportunity to take well-exposed photos. The mysterious lighting made it indeed feel like we were discovering hidden Rome.
Nero built his palace on a plot in the heart of Rome, which was rather conveniently cleared up by the Great Fire. Given that previous emperors lived in what still resembled villas, Nero’s new residence caused outrage for its location and opulence. Many rooms had their walls covered with marble that sparkled in yellow color on contact with sunlight. Together with decorations of golden leaves, these effects gave the palace its name — the Golden House, as Domus Aurea translates.
So, why did we find ourselves underground? Marcella pointed to the bricked-up windows: “Trajan wanted to erase the memory of Nero, so he had the palace sealed off, covered with earth, and incorporated into the hill. That way, he created a platform on which he could build new baths — Trajan’s Baths, of course.” Unfortunately, the art and the marble were mostly ripped off from the palace and reused in the baths upstairs, which have eventually become ruins, too. But we do not need to feel bad because Nero did not get to enjoy his Domus Aurea either. During the construction, he toured Greece to participate in singing competitions — yes, he won all the first prizes — and after he returned to Rome, he was forced to commit suicide just six months after moving into the palace.
A hole in the ceiling
Precisely because we were underground, cut off from the honking and bustle of the streets, the immersion in the world of Ancient Rome was complete, or almost complete, because it still required a lot of imagination, aided by several new multimedia projections on the walls and by Marcella’s stories. We walked through tens of rooms. My neck began to hurt because I kept staring at the vaulted ceilings, some of which were 11 meters (36 feet) high. Those were made possible only because Romans, unlike Greeks, mastered the use of concrete. The remains of the artwork were sparse, but we did see ancient frescos of Trojan War scenes, painted columns showing off the art of perspective, and sketches of fantastical creatures. As history flows in waves, none of these paintings could have been made in the Middle Ages, by which time the required skills and creativity went into decline.
We ended the tour in the most famous of the rooms, the octagonal hall, and left the palace through another tunnel, which has a new ramp designed by the architect Stefano Boeri. The most intriguing spot of the tour was in one of the less important rooms, however. Neither a fresco nor a piece of marble. Marcella alerted us to a hole in the ceiling that someone dug out with simple tools, centuries after the palace was buried into the hill. That hole was an opening expanded by Renaissance artists who scaled down into what looked like a grotto with paintings. The grotto was discovered by accident when a 15th-century young Roman just fell into it while on a stroll.
These grotto visits left the artists in awe that turned into inspiration. One of the motifs they began to replicate was the painted frames around main frescos, full of small, fanciful creatures with animal bodies and human heads, or completely random shapes, made “without any rules,” as art books say. Such a style of art became known as the “grotesque.” The octagonal hall had a special exhibition on this connection between the Ancient and Renaissance eras. Given that Raphael was one of the painters who lowered himself into Domus Aurea, the theme of the whole tour became finally obvious.
A banker and his friend
Raphael created such an amount of art over his twelve years in Rome that even some of his more exquisite work is not well known. Visitors usually get to see the frescoed Raphael Rooms in the Vatican Museums, but then, in a book on Raphael, I read about Villa Farnesina, a suburban palace hidden in a park on the right side of the Tiber, which I identified as another potential hidden treasure. The walk to the villa turned out to be a pleasant, fresh air escape from the narrow streets of the city. You can cross the river on the Ponte Fabricio bridge built in 62 B.C., the oldest one standing in Rome, and take in the view of the surrounding greenery.
Villa Farnesina was built as the main Roman residence of one of the richest men of the Renaissance, Agostino Chigi, who was a banker from Siena and the papal treasurer. While architecturally the building met all the symmetry and elegance requirements of the era, its central room, the loggia, needed an eye-catching decoration. That was when Chigi reached out to Raphael, who was not only a fellow member of the Roman elite but also a close friend of the banker. Raphael got to work, which moved, however, at a suspiciously slow pace— at least according to Giorgio Vasari. The frustrated patron found out that the reason was Raphael’s frequent absence due to “the pursuit of carnal pleasures.” To ensure the painter would stay close to his work, Chigi allegedly asked Raphael’s mistress, with some reluctance, to move into the villa.
But after all, Vasari’s story might be just another example of Roman gossip blown out of proportion because Raphael’s workshop was so established that his assistants could paint by consulting the master’s drawings only, without requiring his presence. Even if Chigi had a lot of hassles with the artist, the result was more than worth it. The large ceiling fresco of Cupid and Psyche, with a blue background and a plethora of figures, many of them naked, of course, represents Raphael at the height of his career. Actually, he passed away only two years later. As I was admiring the work, with only one more visitor around, I also knew to look at the arches on the walls. There they were; the playful, abstract shapes of the grotesques — Raphael’s variation on what he had seen in Domus Aurea.
While I was on the right side of the river, I climbed up through a park to Gianicolo Hill, which stands above Villa Farnesina. The terrace at the top provides a panoramic view of the city, even though, unlike Paris, Rome does not have a single dominating structure. You can see the top of the Colosseum, the National Monument, Spanish Steps and domes of many churches, but none of them stand out, which makes the city appear uniform in the diversity of its architecture. The view is made scenic, nonetheless, thanks to the green skyline of the Sabine and the Alban Hills in the distance.
My view was suddenly interrupted by a guitarist on the terrace, who began playing romantic tunes for the Italian couples enjoying the panorama and gelatos. I got the memo — that spot is more for a Raphael and his mistress than for me and my geographic musings. The only problem was that all great terraces in Rome serve as rendezvous places, whether the Pincio Hill terrace or my favorite archeological viewpoint at the back of the Capitoline Hill.
La Papessa
A higher-than-usual number of people was storming through the streets on scooters and they were carrying Italian flags. The reason turned out to be simple — while I had already forgotten that the country won the Euro 2021 cup in soccer several days before, many Italians had not. Both the night of the final and the subsequent celebrations brought hundreds of people out, with pizzerias putting television sets on the streets and the city putting up a gigantic screen at the Colosseum. The ripples of cheers when Italy scored went through the narrow streets like a tsunami. There was a downside, however. Locals and visitors alike were religious about wearing masks indoors — in restaurants, museums, trains, shops — but then, some let their guards down at the crowded soccer-watching parties, which might have helped fuel an increase in the Covid-19 cases in Rome, leading to new rounds of restrictions.
Although it is romantically simplistic, I like to think that Romans took the pandemic on the chin because, in the end, their city is one big monument to a millennia-long history of fires, sackings, and much, much deadlier plagues. The Antonine plague of the 2nd century A.D. is thought to have contributed to the decline of the Empire. But there were many others. In 1657, a wave of plague claimed the life of the most formidable woman that Rome ever had — Olimpia Maidalchini Pamphilj, who was responsible for another hidden place in Rome that I was going to visit.
Under the right circumstances, Olimpia might have been a ruler in her own right, but in the Rome of her time, the only way to channel her ambition was through a man. Incredibly, that man was the brother of her deceased husband; she dragged the brother up through the hierarchy of the Church until he became Pope Innocent X. It would not have been a Roman story, however, if it did not include a spicy twist, which was easy to conjure up in their case. The city took it for granted that Olimpia was the pope’s lover. Even if that claim proved an exaggeration, no one can dispute that she became the power behind St. Peter’s throne. She made personnel appointments and decided on important issues — so much so that she got a derogatory nickname “La Papessa”, or the female pope.
The hidden worlds behind the doors of Rome
Olimpia knew how to leverage her position to amass a fantastic fortune for the Pamphilj dynasty. Fortunately for us, they invested a large chunk of it into something tangible — an urban palace stuffed with a world-class art collection, which survives to this day as Palazzo Doria Pamphilj, with its Galleria. In any other city, the gallery would be a top attraction. But in Rome, it must compete with other shrines of Baroque art, like Villa Borghese. If you plan properly and book a ticket in advance — the gallery is open only on limited days — you will be treated to a spectacle. The pale grey façade of the Palazzo hides behind scaffolding on the shopping avenue, Via del Corso. As with Domus Aurea, stepping inside means entering a completely different world. There is a quaint, green courtyard with a fountain in the middle and then a series of lavishly decorated rooms where the family lived. The highlight comes in the gilded Hall of Mirrors, with a grandeur that would make it shine even in Versailles.
The collections of the gallery, displayed throughout the Palazzo, include a Raphael, but the Pamphiljs represent a different era — theirs is the Rome of Bernini, Velázquez, and Caravaggio. The first two artists sculpted and painted Innocent X, and those works are exhibited in the Palazzo. Caravaggio was somewhat of a different story, given that he passed away thirty years before the ascent of the Pamphiljs. Even so, they spotted potential in the paintings of the forgotten artist and bought three pieces for their collection. The family was far-sighted in another aspect — they forbid their descendants to sell any works from the gallery, thus preserving this mini-Louvre behind an inconspicuous Roman door.
Once you start searching for hidden and underrated places in Rome, you will find them everywhere. One small door close to Piazza de Navona led me to the Chiostro del Bramante, a courtyard of a perfectly squared shape and with perfectly symmetrical columns. I chose that place to unwind after long walks because there was a café on the upper floor, with a view. While sipping my Americano, I watched people downstairs lining up for a Banksy exhibition inside the cloister. I was, however, more incited by the upper-floor door to the lounge of the coffee shop. I ended up walking in there, and once I got past the sofas occupied by youngsters with laptops, I reached a window that did not lead into a street but into a church. Inside, I could see a beautiful fresco on the wall. The fresco is called Sibyls. It was commissioned by Agostino Chigi, created by Raphael, and, apparently, evaluated by Michelangelo for the patron, so that the right amount could be paid to the painter. Is there any other city in the world where even an attempt to have a quiet coffee in a hidden spot turns into a preview of some of the most magnificent artists in history?

Many rulers throughout history were given epithets by their subjects, such as “the Terrible,” “the Great,” or even “the Holy” and “the Divine.” The Romans were no exception, though they generally preferred less flattering nicknames derived from some article of clothing favored by the emperor — like Caligula, meaning “little soldier’s boot,” or Caracalla, “the Gallic cloak.”
The same Romans gave their final emperor a rather disparaging nickname. In the best case, Flavius Romulus Augustus was referred to as “Augustulus” (“little Augustus,” “minor Augustus”), and in the worst case, “Momillus” (“little disgrace,” “shameful trifle”). Were these nicknames justified? If we speak of the unfortunate Flavius Romulus as a person, most likely not. He could not distinguish himself by either good or bad deeds. His father, General Orestes Flavius, put him on the throne when the lad was about fifteen years old. His reign ended ten months later, with Orestes’s overthrow and the abdication of his son. In reality, during all that time, Flavius Romulus did not rule personally — his father did.

As long as the Coliseum stands, Rome shall stand; when the Coliseum falls, Rome will fall; when Rome falls, the whole world will fall.” — Venerable Bede
Being thirty minutes late is considered normal here, while punctuality feels inappropriate.
Rome is a city where food is a religion. Here, people argue about the best carbonara with the same passion as they do about football. Where coffee is not just a drink but a way of life.
I was there in the summer, the air thick with the scent of espresso and the distant hum of vespas weaving through the streets. The sun hung high over the Eternal City as I made my way to the Colosseum, I ran my hand over the weathered stone. The heat was rising from the ancient cobblestones beneath my feet. With every step, history wrapped itself around me like a well-worn toga, heavy with the weight of emperors’ ambitions and gladiators’ final breaths.
These walls have seen emperors rise and fall, gladiators meet their fate, and crowds roar with bloodlust. They have witnessed the grandeur of Rome at its peak and its slow decline. Every stone here tells stories of the past, if only one could listen closely enough. The underground hypogeum, now exposed to the sky, once was full of life. Hidden…

Also known as the Eternal City, Rome is home to some of the most historic monuments, art, and architecture in the world. Harking back to a time when gladiator fights were the daily form of entertainment, the city is bursting at the seams with fascinating things to see and do.
If you’re not yet convinced, here are 7 reasons why you should visit Rome.
The central Trevi Fountain is one of the most famous fountains in the world. Tourists gather around its impressive carvings every single day to throw coins into the clear water and make a wish.
But it’s not just the Trevi Fountain that promises a showy display of water and statues. In fact, Rome has a lot of access to water thanks to the Roman aqueducts, and the Popes of the Renaissance and Baroque eras tried to outdo each other with the fanciest fountains, many of which you can still see around the city today.
Italian food is renowned for being delicious, but Rome boasts some of the most delectable dishes in the country. Roman artichokes are a firm favourite by locals and tourists alike, while the world-famous spaghetti alla carbonara was born in this wonderful city.
The Vatican (which sits snug in the confines of Rome) is bursting with works by Michelangelo. The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel is doused in his colourful artwork, while the sculpture of Pieta sits pretty nearby.
As well as these, you can also see his sculptures of Christ the Redeemer and Moses elsewhere in the city.
Despite being one of the best-known cities in the world, Rome isn’t particularly big. In fact, it’s small enough that you can see all the attractions on foot (even on the same day), but sizeable enough to find somewhere that nobody else has found, even during the busier periods.
Rome’s history game is incredibly strong — probably one of the strongest in the world, in fact. The entire city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and there are a jaw-dropping number of monuments, ruins, artworks, and feats of architecture to enjoy.
Keep an eye out for the many well-preserved ruins that date back to the Roman Empire, including the Colosseum, the Forum, and Palatine Hill.
Thanks to its location, Rome enjoys a particularly mild climate throughout the year. In the summer months it is gloriously warm, but it’s also extremely pleasant in the winter months, too. This means you can enjoy the sights at any time of the year and feel comfortable venturing there in low-season.
The city itself was founded on Seven Hills, many of which boast incredible views over Rome and its surroundings. For the ultimate hilltop experience, watch the sunset over the ruins of the city.

Rome is a city that captured my heart in ways I never expected. From the moment I arrived, I knew it was a place I would want to return to. The city’s remarkable blend of ancient history, rich culture, stunning art, and lively modern life creates a unique atmosphere that is unlike any other. It’s one of those cities that leaves an impression on you, with its timeless beauty and endless opportunities for exploration.
What impressed me the most was how history is alive in every corner. Walking through the ancient streets of Rome felt like being in an open-air museum. The majestic Colosseum, the impressive Pantheon, and the beautiful Trevi Fountain are not just stones; they are living testimonies of civilizations that shaped the course of humanity. Rome’s history is written in its ruins, its squares, but also in its people, who continue to live in a city full of symbolism and tradition.
Roman culture is equally fascinating, with a rich mix of influences from the Roman Empire, the Renaissance, and the Baroque era. I was in awe of the Vatican Museums, where the works of artists like Michelangelo and Raphael are found around every corner. The Sistine Chapel left me speechless, as if I were in the presence of one of humanity’s most important masterpieces.
What surprised me most about Rome is how it successfully blends its glorious past with a dynamic, modern life. Cafes, fashion boutiques, and lively squares filled with people made me feel that Rome is not only a historic city but also a place that is very much alive in the present. Every afternoon, I enjoyed strolling through its narrow, cobblestone streets, where I encountered a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the vibrant rhythm of the city.
Another aspect that made my experience in Rome even more special was the food. Roman pizza is something you must try, with an impressive variety of ingredients and styles. From the classic Margherita and Capricciosa to more innovative creations, pizza in Rome is a delight with every bite. I also couldn’t resist trying the famous Italian gelato. Roman gelato is an experience in itself — creamy, refreshing, and with flavors I didn’t find anywhere else. Every afternoon, I made it a ritual to enjoy a gelato while walking around the streets, which quickly became one of my favorite activities.
All in all, Rome has a unique magic. It’s a city full of history, art, and culture, but also a city that knows how to enjoy modern life. What impressed me most was how it manages to keep its ancient essence alive while moving toward the future. It’s a destination that is definitely worth visiting over and over again. There’s always something new to discover, and each visit leaves you with the feeling that there’s so much more to explore. I can’t wait to return!

When I visited Rome in May 2024, I kept a diary. This is my first attempt at travel writing and also a way for me to document my experience, since I’m not on Facebook or Instagram.
7th May 2024
This morning I woke up in Rome for the first time. I am also unemployed for the first time in my adult life, since I left my last job last week and I won’t start my new one until the 20th. This is also the first time I’m traveling alone and staying in a hostel (the Jo&Joe Roma, where I am currently writing from).
I arrived yesterday afternoon and I was equally excited and nervous about this solo trip. I enjoy my own company and the freedom of deciding how I spend my time, but I always missing having someone to talk to after spending too long alone. But the nervousness is gone now. It left me somewhere between the second and third glasses of wine I had at a restaurant called Da Edy last night, alongside the best carbonara I’ve ever had.
After that meal, I walked up to the Enni Morricone auditorium to see the Brad Mehldau Trio perform. On the walk, many of the walls were covered in Italian political posters. I occupied myself by looking at each of these and guessing whether the smiling candidates were left-wing, right-wing or centrist based on their appearance alone. I never looked up the answers… for all I know they were estate agents.
The concert itself was impressive. I saw Brad Mehldau a few years ago at the Barbican in London as a solo pianist. Compared to the delicate subtlety of that performance, the trio (which consisted of a pianist, bassist and drummer) was a jazz assault on the senses. The standout track was ‘Boomer’, which Mehldau was quick to clarify was named after his dog, rather than the maligned generation.
Rome is undoubtedly a touristy city, but that concert felt strangely provincial considering that Mehldau is an American musician. During my time there, I didn’t hear a word of English and not even a whisper of an American accent (which are usually hard to miss on the streets of Rome). After a whopping three encores, I walked back through a sleepy Rome. My mind was filled with the logistics of going to bed in a hostel for the first time — when I had checked in earlier, it was clear that I would be sharing the room with three others, but I hadn’t met them yet.
When I got back to my room, I was greeted by the sound of some deep snoring. I discreetly gathered my toiletries from my locker (which was located beneath the bed of the snoring stranger) and then I clambered up into my top bunk. The whole process reminded me of that scene in Toy Story 2 when Buzz and Woody are trying to sneak through a maze of cheetos without waking a dozing man. Later that night, when I was woken by another roommate turning the big light and stumbling around as they arrived, I realized that I had probably been overthinking it.
This morning, I met two of my roommates — an Aussie and a Russian who were both nice enough. The Aussie is half way through traveling the world after graduating university. The Russian is a little bit older and was less clear about his travels… I wanted to ask if he was dodging the draft for the war but, since we’d be sharing a bedroom for the next few days, I decided not to raise that topic.
I then left to visit the Barberini palace, which was stunning. The highlights were a medieval painting of Saint Jerome trampling on a cartoonishly devilish Lucifer and another which featured two cherubs trying to share a papal hat. But the best of them all, undoubtedly, was Judith Beheading Helofernes by Caravaggio. Maybe I’m just a fanboy but I found it astounding how much better his painting was compared to the work of his contemporaries. The chiaroscuro, facial expressions, depth and resonance completely outshined every other painting in the room.
In a couple of hours I’m heading to the capuchin catacombs. Until then, I think I’ll sit in the hostel courtyard with a book and a red wine.
8th May 2024
I was spending this afternoon with a book and a red wine in the courtyard (yes, again) but I have been chased inside by a downpour, so here I am writing.
The catacombs yesterday did not disappoint. It began with a museum which took me through the history of capuchin monks, from when St. Francis first founded the order in the 16th century through to the modern-day. There is something about their asceticism and devout poverty that I find fascinating — mainly because I cannot relate whatsoever. I do doubt somewhat whether they practiced what they preached… who knows what they actually got up to beneath those oversized robes.
The catacombs themselves were a series of six rooms which literally took my breath away. They featured intricate sculptural displays built from pelvises, skulls and every other bone in the body — together forming the shapes of flowers, crests, chairs etc. These sat alongside dismantled corpses, some of which were mummified. Some bodies lay in coffins which were themselves built from various bones while others sat upon thrones built of skulls. This seemed contrary to what little I know about Christian burial rituals and I asked myself whether these friars had consented to having their skeletons on display, and whether they had any idea that tourists (like myself) would be ogling at their corpse hundreds of years later. I’ve told people that I don’t care what happens to my body after I die (since I’ll be dead) but now I will add the caveat that I’d rather not have my skeleton dangling on display in a popular tourist destination.
After the catacombs, I decided to wander over to the Borghese gardens. I didn’t bother with the Borghese gallery itself since half of it is under renovation. Instead I bought a couple of cans of Peroni and lounged in the park. After that, I stumbled upon the National Gallery of Modern Art, an impressive classical building. I wandered in. The art was generally good but unremarkable but I was surprised to stumble upon ‘Fountain’ by Marcel Duchamp, which simply consists of a signed urinal presented in the middle of a room. My surprise was dampened when I realised that this was one of many replicas (the original is lost) though it still reminded me of my Masters degree, when ‘Fountain’ came up in a module titled ‘Thinking With Things’. The whole point is that we perceive a urinal differently when it has been displaced from its typical surroundings — we would never consider pissing in a urinal when it’s presented as a piece of art. Context transforms our perspective and ‘Fountain’ demonstrates that more clearly than anything else. It spurred a lot of art criticism and debate but still, I bet Duchap couldn’t believe that he got away with that one.
When I got back to the hostel I bumped into my Aussie roommate who, like me, was exhausted and hungry. Neither of us wanted to walk very far, so we stumbled into a random touristy restaurant near our hostel. He had carbonara while I went for the rogue choice of steak tartare with a side of artichoke. The artichoke was delicious, soft and garlicky, while the tartare was quite underwhelming — much chunkier than the typical French-style tartare which I adore.
We finished the night at a nearby ‘Irish pub’ called ‘The Flann O’Brien’. Like most continental Irish pubs, it was nothing like an Irish pub. But I was drawn there when I spotted Hop House 13 on their menu (a lovely pale ale made by the Guinness brewery which is no longer sold in the UK) while the Aussie was drawn to the football. We had a wide-ranging chat — I was thankful when it moved from football on to politics and cultural differences. Later that night, when I was in bed, I heard the Aussie get up from his bunk and vomit in the bathroom. I worried that the restaurant was to blame and that my steak tartare would soon reemerge, but thankfully I got a decent sleep.
I didn’t have much of a lie-in, as I was up at 6:30am to get to the Vatican museum in time for my 8:30am tour. I had been told that the crowds are a lot more manageable at this time but, when I arrived, I was amazed at the length of the queue that was already forming around the ancient walls of the Vatican. Thankfully my tour ticket meant that I could bypass this queue completely, and I felt quite smug as I waltzed past those tourists who lacked my advance planning skills.
I didn’t know whether an actual tour guide or audio guide awaited me so I was pleased and impressed by Antonio, our tour guide who had an infectious enthusiasm for the place. We moved through the halls of the Vatican like a slow tide of tourists — it was already heaving at that early hour. But Antonio did a great job of pointing out the most impressive sights as we were shepherded along by the Vatican guards. Without a guided tour, I imagine it would be nearly impossible to appreciate the art and architecture while trying to battle through the crowded maze of corridors. Antonio abandoned us in the galleries that precede the Sistine chapel, giving us the option to march on to the chapel or peruse the artwork first. I was seemingly the only person to choose the latter option, so it was nice to wander the relatively empty galleries (featuring Picasso, Francis Bacon, Van Gogh) after having spent a couple of hours within a horde of tourists.
I headed back into the throng as I made my way into the Sistine chapel. Michelangelo’s frescoes were impressive, as expected, but I was struck by how garish I found the chapel, with every inch of wall dedicated to another saint or bible story. Unlike other impressive churches I’ve seen, where artwork has room to breathe, it was hard to appreciate ‘The Final Judgment’ or ‘The Creation of Adam’ when my peripheral vision was so crowded with various depictions of different popes and apostles. Arguably the biggest takeaway is sheer astonishment at how Michaelnagelo managed to paint the frescoes directly on those high ceilings — achieving such a delicate touch while balancing on shaky scaffolding high above the ground.
It was around midday when I left and I was hungry. I headed towards Trattoria Der Pallero, which had been recommended as a traditional Roman restaurant with a set-menu. I sat down and feasted on nine plates of food — tomatoes, beans, anchovy salad, suppli, two pastas, cured meat, mozzarella, crisps (strangely) and cake. It was absolutely glorious — maybe one of the most satisfying meals I’ve ever had. It was serene to sit beneath the awnings with a carafe of wine and a good book as a friendly Roman man brought me dish after dish. All that for just 30 euros… if I lived in Rome I would be there every week.
The meal and my morning in the Vatican City exhausted me, so I’m going to take it easy this evening. Tomorrow, the Colosseum.
9th May 2024
Last night I got back to the room and the Aussie (whose name I now know is Alec) was there. I said I was looking for a light dinner so he suggested Pinsallegra, a fast food place around the corner which serves pinsas, a type of light crispy pizza. It hit the spot. After that, we headed back to the hostel and had some pints while chatting about traveling and reality tv. We were both exhausted so it was an early night. He left the following morning at 7am to catch a train to Florence — I happened to be up for a wee as he was leaving, so I said bye.
I got up proper a couple of hours later and headed to the Colosseum. There were two lines snaking around the arena, one for ticket holders and one for those without. Thankfully I spotted a sign between the two lines which said ‘Full Experience Tickets’ and that’s exactly what I had. After a quick security check, I was in. I soaked it all up for a bit before heading to the underground, an area which my semi-exclusive ‘Full Experience’ ticket gave me access to. I don’t know whether it was a logistical mistake or as planned, but at this point I was unexpectedly welcomed into a tour group. Our guide brought us through the ‘backstage’ of the Colosseum — the rooms and corridors where the gladiators prepared before boarding the rudimentary lifts which would carry them up into the battleground. Obviously it’s a ruin so, while the magnitude was impressive, it takes some imagination to transport yourself back to gladiatorial times. Apparently, over 400,000 people have died fighting in the Colosseum, making it one of the bloodiest square miles in the world. That thought contrasts against the modern-day reality of the Colosseum: an icon for Rome and a backdrop for selfies.
I had spent about three hours in the Colosseum, so I was hungry and ready for lunch. I made my way across the Tiber into the trendy Trastevere district, where I gorged myself at Sesamo, which serves these odd burger-pizza hybrids. I sat down to eat in their small dining space and next to me was a family from East London. It almost felt like I was back in London, sat in a chicken shop after a night out.
After lunch, I made my way to the Forum, stopping midway for a delicious red berry gelato. When I arrived at the Forum, I was awed. The columns, temples, ruins and gardens were sprawling. It’s baffling how so much (or anything at all) has survived almost two millennia of warfare, plundering and natural disasters. I had no tour or audio guide as I wandered around the Forum so, while I was relatively less well-informed than I was for the Vatican and Colosseum, I had more freedom to walk around at my own pace and soak it all in. The sun was shining and I had a lovely afternoon exploring the Forum while listening to Cassandra Jenkins on my headphones.
After a few hours at the Forum I was tired and, though there was undoubtedly more to see, I knew I had reached my fill of Roman antiquity. I headed back to the hostel. I have not been disappointed by pasta and pizza in Rome, but tonight I fancied something different. I settled on Prosciutteria Cantina dei Papi, a charming spot specializing in cured meats, cheese and wine. I took my seat and asked for a nice wine and a large platter — no menu necessary. It was a feast and probably the best wine I’ve had in Rome. I had a nice seat where I could watch tourists wander the streets while I snacked away.
It was relatively early in the evening, so I was the only person in there except from two young Polish women a few tables over. They made an odd couple, one quiet and reserved and the other one full of energy. At one moment the energetic one convinced the young Italian proprietor to dance with her. He lasted just a few seconds before turning to me with a desperate look and asking “Would you like to dance with her?”. After I declined, I got chatting to the other Polish woman, who became the second person on this trip to tell me that I don’t sound like I’m from London. I asked her what I sound like to her and said ‘normal English’ before putting on her best Dickensian cockney impression to show me what she expected from a Londoner.
That place was just around the corner from the Trevi Fountain, so I headed over to tick it off my list. I had been hugely underwhelmed by the Spanish Steps (it is literally just a staircase) so I wasn’t expecting much. But I was actually blown away by the majesty and intricacy of it — the pristine marble sculptures and the crystal blue waterfall — I’m glad I didn’t miss it. As I stood there, I started to hear clapping and whooping and spotted a man down near the front of the fountain getting down on one knee to propose. The entire crowd cheered as she said yes. It was a lovely moment of collective celebration… though I wouldn’t personally pick such a busy touristy crowd for a proposal.
I’m back at the hostel now, writing this with a beer by the fountain. The cinema across the road is showing the film Wicked Little Letters in English with subtitles in an hour, so I think that’s a good idea to unwind for the night.
11th May 2024
The Italian cinema was surprisingly different from what I’m used to. You cannot be late. As soon as the film starts, the doors seemingly lock, with a light turning ominously from green to red. Also, instead of showing over 30 minutes of advertisements, there are just four or five trailers before the film gets started. The auditorium was quite empty when I arrived so I took a central seat. Minutes later, someone came up and sat right beside me. I don’t know whether they valued the best view or were just committed to the seat on their ticket but this would never happen in the UK where we are much more precious about our personal space (unless you’re on the tube).
The film was fine but unremarkable. It did a good job of making me sleepy and ready for bed. In my half-dazed state, I was surprised to see the other cinemagoers head to a back door rather than back the way we entered. This took us straight through to an alleyway which led to the street. I had only seen this system before in old American movies and I found it oddly charming.
In the morning I made my way to the Vatican City. I had a ticket for the Castel Sant Angelo that would allow me entry at any time, so I planned to hit St. Peter’s Basilica early in the morning, while the sun was still low and the crowds still slim. I was making my way down the Borgo Santo Spinta, the wide road leading towards St. Peter’s Square. I found it strangely quiet and I noticed that the road itself was roped off, with policemen standing alert every few meters. Then a convoy of three or four cars started rolling slowly down the road from the direction of the Vatican. A thought briefly crossed my mind before I dismissed it but then… there he was: in the front passenger seat of one of the cars was the pope himself in full regalia and with a preoccupied look on his face. I was surprised that he was so visible — sat upfront in a slow car rather than hiding in the back behind tinted windows. A group of American tourists behind me shrieked in ecstasy and I made my way to the Basilica.
Even though it was only about 8:30am (no lie-ins for the pope either), the crowd was already vast. It took some time simply to discover where the queue that snaked around the square ended. I eventually joined it and questioned whether to stick it out — I had just seen the pope himself after all, it would be hard to top that. This seemed to be the one queue in Rome that I couldn’t avoid with a premium ticket. Entry to the Basilica is free, so everyone queues together. Even the tour guides with groups of 10–20 tourists had to endure the long queue — I watched as they struggled to keep their guests occupied and interested by sharing little bits of trivia about the Vatican.
I endured and, after almost two hours, I was in. The Basilica is undoubtedly impressive (and much less gauche than the Sistine chapel). It is intricate and vast, with walls and columns that stretch so far and high that it almost feels like you are standing within some kind of microclimate. While I was impressed by the baroque art & sculptures I did find it hard to appreciate them. I much prefer the Gothic atmosphere that you find in cathedrals like Durham. After thirty minutes or so, I had my fill and headed out.
I headed to Castel Sant Angelo (which is also known as Hadrian’s Mausoleum). It was immediately impressive how many different roles this building has played throughout history — mausoleum, papal residency, prison, fort and now a museum — it is the swiss army knife of antiquity. Like a palimpsest, there are visible layers of development. History is visible through the distinct layers of bricks and the slight changes to the architecture as you move from floor to floor. I enjoyed wandering its grand halls and admiring the views across Rome. But after five days of sight-seeing, it was clear that my patience for admiring art and reading my way through museum exhibitions was thinning.
I headed back to the hostel to do some laundry and pack for my departure the next day. I realized that I had just one sight left unticked on my list: the Pantheon. When I arrived, I found it almost cute how the ancient Pantheon is tucked away in a modern bustling Roman square. Rather than standing proud upon a hill (like some of the ruins in the Forum), it shyly sits amongst hotels and restaurants. When I entered, it was hard not to stare up constantly — the dome is an incredible sight and, for the first time on this holiday, I was hoping it would rain so that I could witness the rain fall through the hole in the dome and down into the building.
I found the interior disappointingly Christian — I would have preferred hellenistic statues and relics over the pulpits and crucifixes which greeted me. Like a dog pissing on a lamppost, the Catholic church have crudely claimed the Pantheon as their own. This isn’t an exception in Rome — I had noticed the day before that they had even literally planted their flag in the Colosseum by displaying a large modern crucifix in the middle of the arena. I suppose I should be grateful. These sights wouldn’t have survived to this day if the Christians hadn’t laid their claim, protecting them from being deconstructed for materials or caught in the crossfire of war.
After the Pantheon, I headed to Pompi, a takeaway tiramisu place which had been recommended by a work colleague who is from Rome. It was ok — it had been made without alcohol so it was missing a certain depth of flavour.
I retired to the hostel for the evening, where I sat in the courtyard sipping wine for the last time. I was joined by Dan, the new Aussie who had replaced Alec in the bunk below me. He’s the head chef of a fancy restaurant in Melbourne, so I enjoyed quizzing him on the restaurant business: “Are specials really just a way to get rid of excess ingredients?” (sometimes) “Do celebrities get better treatment?” (Yes). It was the right way to end my time in Rome — sat in the evening sun sipping wine, eating pasta and talking about food.
That concludes my time in Rome. The food, history and culture did not disappoint. I also discovered the joy of solo travel for the first time — enjoying both my own company and brief encounters with fellow travelers. That said, five days was the perfect amount of time and I would always rather share the experience. As I write, I am speeding towards Naples on a train. I can’t wait to spend a few days with Ashley in the sun.

Walk down the jet bridge in your comfy cute style, ready for your first day in Rome. Just skip packing your Gucci python print heels on this escapade.
You can look stylish wandering Rome by looking at number-two of these 12 Rome tips without looking like the goofy tourist in your wanderlust.
We chose to fly to Roma on Easter weekend for our very first time. I’m in-touch with the crazier ideas when it comes to traveling and now know how to keep you from looking the out-of-sorts maniacal traveler.
Easter weekend — in the Catholic capitol — we thought, “Lets visit Rome!”
One-step-nuttier…We added a tour of the Vatican on the list!? {Go off the high dive of nuts — or don’t go at all!}
If you knew my Hubs, this sort of crazy optimism wouldn’t be so shocking. He’s an “all-in”, “it’ll be fine” kinda guy.
And if you don’t make it into Vatican City, there’s always a gelateria nearby ready to serve it’s oh-so-sweet-goodness. Gelato makes everything better!
On to the gelato! {Plus the 12 tips}
If you’re traveling to Rome, these are the 12 best travel tips to keep you from looking like the nutter tourist…
The midday rest hours is a thang in Italy, but slowly drinking your coffee is not. Order your frothy cappuccino or caffè macchiato {an espresso with a splash of milk} at the bar, take your receipt to pick up your cuppa, and drink up. Sitting down at a table to leisurely drink can double your bill {table service fee}.
The cobblestone streets of Rome are part of its old world charm. You’ll be doing a lot of walking along those cobblestone streets, and heels don’t fit this trip {they do fit nicely in the cobblestone cracks and break your heels though}. Save your cute spikes for your Asheville weekend.
There are good walking-around stylish shoes to pack for walking Rome::
When you pop into the small boutiques or family-owned shops, greet the owner {most small shops or artisan workshops are operated by the owners}. Greet them with “Buongiorno” {good day} until afternoon and “buonasera” {good evening} after. {Ciao is an easy hi/bye, if that’s what you’re looking for}.
No need to rattle off Eat, Pray, Love in Italian, but making an effort to speak the language goes a long way in ANY COUNTRY you visit {except for maybe France. Depending on who you try it with, they can get a bit testy}.
As with ANY TRAVELING, keep an eye on your bags. In crowded areas {and all of Rome’s popular sites are overflowing with people}, carry your bags on your front or use a protected travel backpack like this one.
SIDE STYLE TIP:: Belt bags are the new fanny packs 😉 I bought mine in the wine color because it’s purty. But turns out it’s a BRILLIANT CHOICE if you’re a wine spiller too 🙋🏼‍♀️ {anyone else raising their hand?}
We are walkers most of the time, but getting to certain places in Rome requires wheels. The city buses were those wheels that Easter trip. Buy your tickets ahead of time because they DO NOT sell tickets on the bus.
Buy tickets at any tabaccheria in the city. Shops are designated with a large “T”. Tickets are €1.50 each, or choose a 24-hour, 48-hour, or weekly ticket for a discounted price. Tickets are valid for all public transportation in Rome (bus, metro, tram and local train).
Bypass the lines and purchase tickets to the more popular sites AHEAD OF TIME. Many of these sell out quickly. Do a little planning ahead and buy your tickets online before your trip. { Vatican and Sistine Chapel, Colosseum, St Peter’s Dome & Basilica tour are big hits}
You don’t need a ticket to visit Trevi Fountain, but it’s wildly popular and not much fun squishing your way through a ka-jillion of your closest strangers. Grab your cappuccino and make that your first view of the day.
OORRRR, make a night stop to see it under all the beautiful lights. We did both, and 18/19 tourists agree…nighttime viewing is best, mainly because…fewer peeps standing around in your photos 📷
We ran out of time, but one tour that’ll be on our 2024 trip itinerary is the traditional pasta-making and wine tour in Frascati {40-min train ride from Rome}.
Since the pandemic, credit cards aren’t the frowned upon payment they once were, but good ol’ coin still reigns supreme — especially in smaller-run businesses.
Keep some on hand during your trip.
One of THE BEST parts of foreign travel is the exposure to other cultures. Dinner in Rome might be one of those adjustments, unless you’re a snacking queen like myself🤗
Dining and drinking are rituals in Italy. Don’t rush. First, enjoy an aperitivo. You’re meeting up for a pre-dinner drink and light eats {similar to Happy Hour} at 7pm, after a day of sight-seeing.
However, don’t eat too much Italian deliciousness, because dinner follows around 8, 9, or even 10pm.
Might want to grab an extra caffè macchiato for your long Roman days to keep moving until dinner, or take a midday rest {riposa} like the locals, from 1–3-ish.
This Art of Aperitivo post will help you fit in with the locals at aperitivo time.
Anytime + all-the-time is when you look for your next gelateria to try a new flavor. DO NOT LEAVE ROME without trying at least one flavor, no, five…maybe six. Depends on the season, since they keep rotating.
Order the house wine –you’ll love it– and don’t expect pizza drowning in sauce.
It’s the simple cooking that makes Italian foods mouth-watering, along with the extra pounds you’ll pack home with you. 😬
Enjoy it the way it comes. Don’t ask for sauces {I see you, ranch lovers} or try to salt your capressi or bruschetta into a cardiac arrest.
Yes, Italians love their pastas, pastries, and pizza {as well as coffee, wine, and gelato…}. But believe it or not, there are also salad and vegetable options. Look under “CONTORNI” on the menus {their side dishes}.
Always, always, for the love of Italy, save space for dessert + your after-dinner-sip of limoncello.
That said, you’ll want to put foreign phone service on at least one phone in your party. Wi-fi can be spotty at hotels and cafés.
If you’re using your phone for directions on your trip, pay extra to add on foreign service {or check out the BONUS TIP BELOW}.
Whenever we’ve gone international with our teens, they didn’t have phone service. I’m a mama who has her kids back! No Snap notifications, texts, games… BEST TRIPS EVVV-ER!

When the modern man is on break at work, does he ever wonder about Rome? What would it be like to live in Rome? In this article, I will answer these burning questions. We shall explore the fascinating world of ancient Rome and her people, starting with the lowest classes — the slaves — working towards the freedman, the artisans, the patrician class, and finally, the emperor and his family.
To keep our imagination engaged, we shall compare pagan Rome with Christian Rome — their customs, laws, and government. Let us see how they compare.
Pagan Rome, like many before and after her, assigned her citizens into a ‘caste’ system; that is, whichever caste or part of society you were born into, that is where you stayed… period. No one from the lower castes — slaves and poor merchants — could move up the social hierarchy without the nobility’s sign-off. However, there was one unique citizen (this did depend on who their former master was) who enjoyed more perks than the patrician class. Former slaves, called freedmen, would wonder about the empire trying to start a new life. For the vast majority, life was still hard and full of suffering. The emperor’s former slaves had it differently. Ambition and ego caused distrust between family members and the royal house: many emperors trusted their household slaves more than their family members and senators. This was especially true for the tyrannical emperors.
To counter potential plots and schemes, many emperors, the most infamous of which was Claudius, would assign essential matters of the crown to their loyal, well-educated freedmen. In a tavern or banquet, one could hear about Claudius sending his freedmen on diplomatic duties to a senator he despised. Robert Knapp, in his book Invisible Romans, gives us an idea of the attitude of Roman elites,
The hatred of imperial freedmen especially, but uppity freedmen in general, brought scathing opprobrium to focus on this societal group. To keep them at bay, they were disparaged as forever despised, inferior; they were marked by law and custom as unworthy of mixing with the elite in politics or marriage or anything (pg. 171).
Under Roman law, slaves had no intrinsic, God-given value while in bondage. (Christ and His teachings did mark a change in Roman society towards slaves. Gradually, slaves became known as ‘serfs’, a class with limited rights under the law — nevertheless, it was a step in the right direction. The ‘citizen’ held the right of sovereignty (participation in politics), which was reserved for Rome’s patrician class — especially during the empire, as Augustus ensured this was the case. Any citizen of Rome, from the emperor to a wealthy freedman, could own slaves. (However, freedmen were banned from holding political offices.) The practice was not limited to the patrician class. Roman citizens could do whatever they wanted with their property, and many did.
In pagan Rome, religion played a meditating role between ruler and ruled. Barbarian tribes became Romanized over the generations thanks to a Roman policy of sending chieftain sons to Rome for schooling. A Roman teacher could draw similarities and suggest that Romans and barbarians worshipped the same gods under different names. Polytheistic religions are helpful in this regard — the gods of Rome dominate. Yet, there are no significant differences in terms of teachings on how to live the good life in polytheistic religions. Also worthy of note is the caste system. Caste systems — the ordering of society — did exist outside of Rome’s borders. In principle, barbarians ordered their kingdoms in much the same way as the Romans; the only difference was who stood at the top. In Rome: the emperors and his nobles. In Germany: a Germanic chieftain and his nobles.
Before Christ and His teachings began to ring through the ears of Rome’s elite, preaching a life, by authority of the Ten Commandments, of modesty and chastity for both sexes. Pagan Rome’s idea of happiness and meaning is found in worshipping The Self. Biblical religion, unlike Pagans, is a willingness to submit their will to the Lord: a living, just and holy God outside of time and space who communes with man via the Holy Spirit. One can have a relationship with Him by following His Commandments, his Son’s teachings, and listening to His spirit — the Holy Spirit.
Because of the lack of Commandments in Pagan religions, people would worship particular gods of this phenomenon or archetype. Meaning they would pray to the sky, sea, or earth, all phenomenon inside Creation. Therefore, if you wanted to live your life in the pursuit of pleasure, you would find yourself a member of the Dionysian cult — the god of wine and pleasure. Every pagan god, the Christians would claim, is nothing more than an archetype of human nature or Creation; therefore, if one chooses to worship Dionysus or ISIS (the Great Mother Goddess), one becomes Dionysus or ISIS. Morality becomes subjective as these gods are not lawgivers or the revelation of Truth in the cosmos.
Consequently, people worship whichever deity they believe will bless them the most. Pagans choose which gods to worship to serve their own needs. In the Christian paradigm, all humans are under the Lord’s authority whether they like it or not, and acts of sin (like idolatry) will lead us down a path filled with lies and misery.
Public baths are an excellent case study as they give us some idea of Rome’s impression of nudity. The Caesars would try to outbid each other with their public works buildings, a favourite being public baths. During the empire, the sexes were separated from one another, depending on the number of scandals. However, it must be noted that the law was changed because too many people got caught fornicating. It was not a decision born of Biblical principles: man’s propensity to sin forced the empire to act.
To sum up, Pagan Rome’s view on sex was very liberal. State-sponsored brothels and Dionysian parties did indeed occur regularly. The lack of moral values in pagan religions meant the state tolerated this behaviour, only interfering if things of out of hand. In pagan Rome, one could complain about this despicable behaviour, but the state would not legislate against such behaviour. Many have probably attended such festivities and were unwilling to take the risk. Prior to Christianity, sexual sins were part of the higher culture — which only got worse as Rome began to expand her borders. Republican senators of the empire, inspired by the likes of Cato and the Stoics, longed for the long-forgotten values that made Rome. Her men have been corrupted by the pleasures she has to offer.
The courts in Rome during the Republic were mainly dominated by one particular faction, family, or alliance. Rome’s republican government was designed to stop the tyrannical will of one man, which it did pretty well. However, ambitious men serving the will of Rome would rule through alliances and ‘favours’ owned by men they helped, receiving special treatment and privileges. Sulla is one such example. Nepotism was hard to combat in such a system due to the lack of a rival branch of government: control over Rome’s legions was all one needed.
The caste system in Roman society made it hard for everyday men and women to prosecute someone above their station. I imagine freedmen and artisans (like blacksmiths) did not take crimes committed by nobles to the courts — they had no money nor the will to do so. Very often, in such situations, another member of the patrician class would stand in on behalf of the lower classes. Usually, to the detriment of his standing within Rome’s elites, one ought not to spend time with slaves and peasants. During the Republic, a Stoic senator who governed Sicily so well the Sicilians wanted to make him an honorary Sicilian managed to find himself in court.
What is the charge, you ask? Jealousy. Rivals jealous of our senator’s competencies and deserved admiration from his peers, his rivals, filled with the spirit of Kane, wanted nothing more than to witness his fall from grace. The kangaroo court sentenced him to exile. Roman law and legislators only applied to Roman citizens — leaving the rest to be exploited — and anyone challenging the status quo would meet the same faith as our senator.
Not much changed during the reign of the Caesars. The nature of monarchical governments — where one man’s will is enacted throughout the government — is seen as divine and just, as the emperor was considered a living god. An opposition voice or party being considered in the Senate is unlikely. No man would dare question the emperor’s divine will unless he was willing to part with his head. Monarchical systems can work well… it all depends on the grace and disposition of the emperor. Plato’s Republic was the model for ancient kings and emperors: over the years, many attempts were made to live up to the ideal of the philosopher-king, although most never came close to the title. Plato claimed that men of philosophy made the best rulers. Marcus Aurelius is a good example. However, many did give in to sin and thus became evil rulers of themselves and their subjects.
The law did begin to change thanks to Christian ethics. The story of Moses freeing the Jews from bondage was no longer told to Jewish children. Greek and Latin were the common languages in the Roman Empire. The story of God leading Moses and the Jews out of Egypt could, thanks in part to the Romans, reach every ear within her border. In effect, the Biblical ethos told through the prophets of the Bible eventually influenced, at first, Rome’s culture and customs as more and more people started to see reality through the eyes of Christ. This would lead to a change in the law justified by Biblical ethics. One would ponder: is this law Christ-like?
Tell me, dear reader, would you last a day in Pagan Rome?

«Governing the Italians is not difficult; it’s useless.»
This made-up quote has been falsely attributed to various historical figures: the fascist dictator Mussolini, the politician Giovanni Giolitti, and even Winston Churchill.
But the phrase contains an element of truth, as it’ll be apparent the moment you arrive in Italy’s capital.
It’s way dirtier and scruffier than a big European capital city has any right to be.
Especially one that charges every visitor who stays overnight 7.50€ of city tax per day.
The traffic (and the noise and pollution it generates) is atrocious, to the point that, at times, it made even a lifelong gearhead like me wish cars were never invented.
But try using public transport, and you quickly realize why there are so many cars around. Just two metro lines (plus one under…

I’ve never felt like this when going to the Italian capital. This sense of inadequacy, to be surrounded by misery at every corner and corruption.
“Maybe I was ignoring it all and just focusing on its helpless fascination when I lived here in 2017 for a semester and during subsequent visits?” I ponder as I exit the Roma Termini station and start heading to a coffee shop for breakfast — of course, a croissant and cappuccino.
I need to head to the American embassy later on to get my visa approved to go to the US. To do so, I’ll cross a big chunk of the city center by foot.
I can’t get out of my mind the stats I recently heard on an Italian investigative journalism program (the last bastion of seriousness in an otherwise trash-populated TV):
80%, perhaps 90% of business activities in Rome are in the hands of mafia.
80, 90%.
There is a chance that I had breakfast in one of their bars, and very likely later on, I will have lunch in another one too.
Businesses of any type are utilized by various…

A Place to Be Funny Without Being a Jerk

January 3, 2022|Italy
Today, I walked through the heart of non-ancient Rome. Twice. The first time solo and in the daylight. The second time after sunset with Boo.
I started the day with what has become my Italian hobby — doing laundry. You may think that we are extra dirty or changing our clothes several times a day, but the truth is that European washing machines are shockingly tiny. I can only do about a quarter of what would be a load in my big honking American washer. I shudder to think what families with children must do about laundry here in Europe. The washing machine must run 24/7. That’s been nearly the case for us, and we’re just two relatively clean adult women (although we’ve had our moments). And there’s generally no clothes dryer which means that everything has to be painstakingly laid out to dry.
God bless America and its gigantic appliances.
Anyway, we slept late, and my travel companion decided that she wanted some down time — which was totally fine with me. I told her she could stay in the apartment while I wandered around.

Last Fall, I started thinking about bucket list trips. I’m not getting any younger, and I’m seeing minor blips in a formerly well-running system. I have a chronic leg injury that can make mobility a challenge on certain days. On top of that, the world is in a state where travel is becoming stickier, even amongst long-time allies.
I figured in the next five to seven years, I should focus on doing a few big trips that matter to me, the places I’d be disappointed if I didn’t get to see. That way, if a day comes when international travel isn’t a great idea for me anymore, I’ll have no regrets.
For my first of these trips, I pondered several spots, but Italy always held a huge lead. I’ve been fortunate enough to see a lot of Europe, but hadn’t yet gotten to the boot. As a solo traveler, I’ve felt intimidated to go somewhere I don’t speak the language. But Italy is a tourist mecca, so I knew they’d cater to North Americans. Plus, apps like Google Translate make that stuff less worrisome.
In real life, I’m not the kind to flock to hot, happening places. Toronto always has a cool new restaurant, but I don’t like waiting in lines and sitting elbow-to-elbow while I eat my overpriced deconstructed…

Vatican City, the smallest sovereign state in the world, is a walled enclave in the city of Rome
Rome, the capital of Italy, is a multi-faceted place. From the erstwhile Roman Empire to the present day capital of modern Italy, Rome has been among the big names in must see places in Europe. It has been in literature in the form of all time famous maxims: ‘Rome was not built in a day’, ‘While Rome was burning, Nero was playing his fiddle’ and ‘When in Rome do as the Romans do’ and on the Hollywood film scene with block busters like ‘Fall of the Roman Empire’ and ‘Roman holiday’. Roman English is also in common use. Rome is not burning any more and the infamous Nero is long gone. Unlike the Mughal and the Soviet Empires the Roman Empire re-emerged from the ashes and the Roman holiday is very much on. A trip to Italy, in this context, will be long remembered.
Far from stereotypical Mediterranean, Italy’s climate varies from place to place. We landed at Rome International Airport under a heavily overcast sky. It was actually a light drizzle that we encountered on arrival from Athens and that reminded me of a friend who had visited Rome a couple of years ago but could enjoy it only from his hotel window. He believed in the famous verse:
Aaye kuchh abr kuchh sharaab aaye
Being averse to sedentary life style and drinking, I was really worried about the impending continuity of the inclement weather in the next few days. Though the sun remained under the cloud cover during most of our stay in Italy, to our good luck, the rain did not disrupt our programme any further and we moved around at will.
A Republic since 1946, Italy consists of the mainland Italian peninsula and two large Mediterranean islands namely Sicily and Sardinia further south and enclaves the sovereign states of Vatican and San Marino, the later, lesser known to the outside world, being the 5th smallest state both by area and population. After the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the victorious Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II was the first of the rulers of the Ottoman Empire to assume the title ‘Caesar of the Roman Empire’.
We had planned a trip to about half a dozen European destinations in slightly less than four weeks time and had to budget-plan our outings. A friend very kindly handed me a book ‘Europe 20 Dollars a day’ (It was an old addition, the latest being Europe 50 Dollars a day) and this book really proved very handy with the minutest of the travel details and tips. We booked a place in a pension, French style boarding house, at competitive rates, on the National Street, mid way between the city centre and the Rome railway station. There could not have been a better location to see the historic city.
Sprawling over seven hills, the city of Rome has River Tiber flowing through the city centre. Incidentally most of the heritage sites were located close to where we were staying and when the tour operators gave a strike call, on the fateful day we had reserved for the city tour, we made good use of the book mentioned earlier. Taxis with English speaking cabbies were very expensive so we used public transport for site seeing. The bus tickets were not sold on board but had to be purchased from the ‘T’ shops (tobacco shops) in the side streets. Language being a big barrier I was fooling around looking for the ‘T’ shop when an Italian lady came to our rescue. Attracted to my wife’s Pakistani dress she told us that her spouse was from Bangladesh and offered any possible help which we gratefully accepted. Her guidance was of extreme help and from then on we went around the metropolis with utmost ease.
Piazza Venezia, the main city square, and former dictator Mussolini’s official quarters were just fifteen minutes walk from the National street. It was where Poet of the East Allama Iqbal had met the then strongman on his European tour. There were three concrete maps drawn on a wall near this imposing building and they showed the expanse of the Roman Empire in three different eras. It looked as if half of the world, at one point, was under the Roman rule. What a glorious past? Coliseum, the largest amphitheatre in Europe which could accommodate around 50000 spectators, was close by and a monument to see. Trevi fountain, frequented by the tourists in colossal numbers, is a place where one could wish, by throwing a coin into the water, for anything, except the proverbial free ride horses (for the beggars to ride). There were a large number of coins shining in the water on the floor of the fountain, each showing somebody’s secret wish. Following the tradition we too wished for the moon and got rid of some coins in the process.
Walking on a footpath one fine morning in the city centre we heard police cars with screeching tires and blowing sirens and assumed that some film shooting was going on. It was only the following day we came to know that some outlaws were being chased by the law enforcing agencies and a German tourist was killed in the cross fire. It was really hard to digest that such things could happen in a European capital in broad day light.
Vatican City, the smallest sovereign state in the world spread over an area of 44 hectare (108.7 acres), is a walled enclave in the city of Rome. It houses St. Peter’s church and Papacy. Created in 1929 the papal city state has its own postal services, a heliport, radio station and a publishing house. It issues its own coins though, like in Italy, Euro has replaced the age old Lira. Its population is just over 800 persons but millions of visitors throng the place every year. Vatican has the highest per capita crime rate in the world including purse snatching and pick -pocketing. At the church entrance it was interesting to see a notice reading; ‘Please cover your legs and heads before entering’. Such rules always sanctify the place.
Pisa was our next destination. We undertook a four hour long train journey to the city of the famous tower through the picturesque landscape with the Mediterranean Sea on one side and vast fruit orchards on the other. Large motor car carriers were seen plying in large numbers on the express way with locally manufactured cars loaded on them in tiers. We took a bus from the railway station to the leaning marble structure which is a free standing bell tower of the cathedral of the city of Pisa that would have collapsed long ago had it not been for the support of the millions of visitors who get themselves photographed with the tower as if they were preventing it from crumbling to the ground. We too did our bit towards supporting the sinking monument and took photographs as a testimony. I once saw a cartoon in the famous Punch magazine which showed the under construction (then vertical) tower of Pisa with scaffoldings all around and the architect telling his colleague: “There is a small defect in the foundation but rest assured nobody is ever going to notice it”. Fifty-six meters high, this 12th century building leans at an angle of just 5.5 degrees but at the top it measures 4.5 m from where it used to stand vertically.
Historically Galileo did his experiments by dropping two cannon balls from the top of the leaning tower to augment his theory of speed vs. mass, the Nazis used it as an observation post during WW II and Mussolini ordered it to be returned to its normal vertical position albeit without success. In 1964 the Italian government decided to keep the tilt for the promotion of tourism and kept it closed for the visitors for almost a decade to reinforce its foundations from sinking further. The heavy bells, seven in number, were removed to shed the extra load and it was declared stable for another 300 years.
The vehicular traffic in Pisa was somewhat more disciplined than that of Rome. An article in the Readers Digest titled ‘Driving Italian style’ eulogized that driving reflected the character of a nation and the painting supporting the article was no different than the one we see every day in our motherland except that the vehicles on the roads in Rome were cent per cent mechanized, unlike Pakistan where stone age animal driven carts are still plying side by side with the modern automotives. The city fathers in Rome are trying to device ways to overcome the traffic congestion and parking problems by disallowing the unauthorized traffic from the central part of the city during work days from 6 am to 6 p.m. We in Pakistan too will have to think of sorting this problem out sooner than later.
Latin, the original language of the Empire, was changed to Italian in the middle ages. Italian is a confluence of various regional dialects and in that respect has some theoretical semblance with Urdu, which itself is a conglomerate of different expressions. The Islamic community has grown significantly since the ‘not very distant’ past due to immigration from North Africa and the Middle Eastern countries and Rome can boast of the largest mosque in Europe built in 1995. We also came across Arab vendors selling their merchandize, especially semi precious stones, on the foot paths in Rome. The string of these multi coloured gems lent further hue to the already colourful side walks.
Our memorable trip to the historic city came to a close and we boarded Alitalia for Orly international Airport, Paris.

Rome is the place where you need to get lost! The city that’s full of surprises, history, charm, and colors. Put away your map, and roam around the historic center of Rome to discover beauties, that you couldn’t imagine! That’s the only way to really experience the eternal city, and the beautiful streets to see in Rome!
Even if you’ve been in Rome, you’ve never actually seen Rome if you didn’t get lost on those colorful cobbled streets. That’s a fact! After 9 visits, I can tell you, that I still didn’t see it all! And believe me, I’ve spent way too many hours roaming around already! Let’s see now some highlights!
Via della Reginella & Via dei Pastini
Those incredible little streets are one of the many reasons I love the Italian capital so much! It’s all about experiencing, breathing it in, enjoying it. Rome is not the place where you should be running with a tourist bus around. Rome is the city that you have to experience, to feel!
As simple as that. This is also the reason why each blogger and travel expert is suggesting to WALK when you’re visiting Rome! There’s so much more than the main landmarks, so much more hidden beauty!
This is very common in many big cities… to not have the opportunity for any memorable street experience. But Rome, Rome has the most beautiful streets to wander around for as many hours as you can!
If you’re a frequent visitor on my blog or my Instagram, you may already know that I have an obsession with colorful streets… Well, that obsession started in 2015 here, in the Eternal city!
Via del Governo Vecchio is the street where I spend most of my time when I’m in Rome. I discovered it back in 2015, and ever since that, this is my favorite street in Rome! Via del Governo Vecchio runs from Piazza Navona almost to the Castel San Angelo, parallel with the main street of Corso Vittorio Emmanuele II.
My favorite bar, the Bistro and Wine Bar Pasquino, and one of my fav restaurants, the Ristorante Pasquino is located on this street. They are both steps away from Piazza Navona. Also, one of the best gelaterias (ice cream shops) called Ice cRome is located right opposite these restaurants. Besides the charm, that really Italian narrow, cobbled street vibe, the buildings are beautiful as well!
Via del Governo Vecchio also offers a variety of bars, restaurants, shops, more gelaterias, art galleries, and antiquity stores all along the way! There’s no way to not find something you like on this street!
Find details about this area, Piazza Navona and it’s a neighborhood in my previous article: BEST NEIGHBOURHOODS IN ROME: NAVONA
Each big city has its fashion street where you can find all the famous luxury brands. In Rome, this street is called Via dei Condotti. A street linking Via del Corso with Piazza di Spagna, where you can find the famous Spanish Steps.
If you’re heading from Via del Corso through Via dei Condotti, you’ll gain an amazing view of the Spanish Steps and the church of Trinita dei Monti. So even if you’re not interested in shopping, or admiring the shopfronts, this view is worth a walk through Via dei Condotti!
Via Condotti features all the famous Italian brands like Armani, BVLGARI, Versace, and Prada. Though, you will find others like Chanel, Luis Vuitton, Swarowski, or Cartier to. When I’ve first walked down this street I was still at university. That day I’ve promised myself, that if once I’ll buy a luxury item, I will do it on this street! Still preparing for that…
Via del Moro & Via della Pelliccia
Trastevere is my second favorite neighborhood in Rome after the Navona neighborhood! It is located south of the Vatican city, near the Tevere river. One of those things I love the most in this area is the streets. Colorful, cozy, vibrant, and VERY ITALIAN. You’re bumping into traditional bars and restaurants on every step, literally! Colorful buildings, the flowers, the cobblestone roads… it’s just enchanting and fascinating.
Vicolo Moroni
In the past two years, I’ve been always booking my hostels/hotels/b&bs in Trastevere. One of my favorite places, while I was traveling alone, was the Orsa Maggiore Hostel for Woman Only. There’s nothing better than going out in the morning for a cappuccino and having it in such a beautiful atmosphere!
Trastevere is a bit outside the center of the city, which explains why is still much more traditional, and Roman, than other sides of the historic center. For a real Italian experience in Rome, definitely try to stroll around the streets of Trastevere!
Via Margutta runs between Piazza di Spagna and Piazza del Popolo. It’s a more hidden street, but with Google Maps you’ll find it easily. Originally, Via Margutta was home to various stables and workshops. It changed its face in the 20th century though!
It became famous after the premiere of the Roman Holiday movie. As you may know, Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) in the movie was living on this street of Rome, on Via Margutta. Thanks to the success of the Roman Holiday movie, many famous people moved here afterward.
This is how the neighborhood slowly became an exclusive, really expensive neighborhood in Rome. Today Via Margutta is hosting numerous art galleries, luxury shops, and restaurants. The neighborhood is still the residence of a wealthier layer of Romans.
This street goes parallel with the Tevere river in the historic center of Rome. It’s really close to Piazza Navona, Corso Vittorio Emmanuele II, and Campo di Fiori. Via Giulia was one of the first projects of Renaissance Rome. The street was designed by Bramante, who at the same time was working on the St Peter’s Basilica.
The street links the Ponte Sisto Bridge with the San Giovanni di Fiorentini church. Back in the 16th century, it was Rome’s most fashionable street, where merchants and bankers lived. It’s still considered a really elegant side of Rome, though it looks like it’s not as popular as a couple of years ago. Via Giulia, the past decades was really popular for its antiquities and fashion boutiques, but today you won’t find many of these open.
However, this street of Rome is still considered significant because of the amazing renaissance artist, Michelangelo! He had a plan to connect the Palazzo Farnese which can be found on this street, to the Farnese Villa in the Trastevere district. You can still see this arch leaning over Via Giulia on its southern end.
Vicolo del Malpasso & Vicolo della Scimia
Some of my favorite hidden streets are in the neighborhood of Campo di Fiori. As this side of the Corso Vittorio Emmanuele is not that overwhelmed with visitors, the streets are much nicer, calmer, charming. As I was staying mostly in the Trastevere neighborhood, the easiest way to get there was always through the cobbled streets. This is how I discovered both Vicolo del Malpasso and Vicolo della Scimia between many others!
Vicolo della Scimia got burned into my brain because I had to pass through it every single time I was going to or from the historic center of Rome. This one street couldn’t be replaced with another, and I was always freaking out on it. Don’t worry, it’s a safe street! Otherwise, I wouldn’t be suggesting seeing it!
The reason I was freaking out, because I’m terribly afraid of rats, and Rome has a great population of them. On this vicolo, there’s no place to go right or left, and it has no doors. So you get on it on one side of the palazzo block and you get out on the other side. So I was always stressed out, that what if a huge rat will walk against me?!? Where I’m going to run? What if one walks onto the street from one side and the other from the other side? I can’t escape!!! Of course, that never happened, but when someone’s this terrified, our brain can play with us a lot.
So, don’t worry, just put away your map, and head on to explore the streets of Rome. Discover the magic, find the hidden gems, and just breathe the atmosphere in. Rome has unbelievable magic, that you need to experience yourself!

“You packed what for Rome in March?”
That was the customs officer, eyeing my linen jumpsuit and flip-flops as if I’d just stepped off a cruise ship in the Arctic. To be fair, I thought March in Italy meant early spring. Blossom-scented breezes. Aperol spritzes under the sun. The Colosseum is adorned with charming gowns.
Instead, I stepped into what felt like a chilly Roman version of Seattle. The wind whipped through my bones. Locals wrapped themselves in puffer jackets and scarves. And there I was, dragging my tiny carry-on and an overinflated ego through cobblestone streets in socks that were basically social distancing from warmth.
Let me save you the frostbite. Here’s what I wish someone had told me before that first trip.
Italy in March sounds like a dream: off-season travel, fewer crowds, blooming landscapes, cheaper everything. And yes, that part is true.
But what your dreamy Pinterest boards don’t tell you? March in Italy is moody. One moment you find yourself soaking up the golden sunlight on the Spanish Steps, and the next, you find yourself sprinting through an unexpected downpour. The weather changes its mind more often…

I have said this many times before and will say it again- Rome is my favorite city in the world. Why? Because it’s the perfect blend of history and the modern world. It has it all- beautiful historical sites, amazing shops and of course; the perfect pizzas ever.
So here’s my experience of Rome and why it’s soo awesome:
Italian hospitality is unbeatable. The Italians treat you like long lost buddies right from the moment you first meet. The hotel staff are extra nice and attend to your complaints within seconds. But the best about Italians is the way they speak. Their language comes out like a sweet song. It so adorbs that I wouldn’t be able to guess even if they were swearing at me.
If you think you have eaten the best Italian food ever in your own countries, you’re gravely mistaken my friend. The best Italian food comes from the source…which would be Italy in this case (well obviously). These Italian restaurants/cafe’s serve the most scrumptious ravioli, epic mouth-watering risottos and pizzas to die for. I would make a trip back to Rome simply for the food if I could.
Rome’s history is divided into two parts. The Roman Empire and Medieval history. The architecture of each era is spread out into two distinct areas. The walk to the Colosseum is one of the most enchanting walks I have ever taken. There are ancient relics on either side of the pathway adding to the charm. The Medieval historical sites give off a very “Game of Thrones” vibe.
This mini-city on its own would make a trip to Rome worth-it. The Vatican some of the most beautiful frescos ever in the Sistine Chapel. You will find hundreds of tour guides right outside the Vatican who will give you a tour of the church and museum. Just make sure that you don’t get ripped off!
Milan is technically a major fashion capital but Rome isn’t far behind. The shopping here is marvelous from boutique brands to mainstream brands. There’s a Zara store that’s four stories high (I spent around two hours there I think). After a day of hard-core shopping you can relax in a nice spot, having street-made square pizzas and watch the sun setting over the beautiful historical ruins. Bliss!
Fun Fact: The Trevi Fountain– a must see site- has magical powers. Apparently whoever puts a coin in there is sure to come back to Rome one day. My mom put the coin twice and has visited Rome twice ever since. I put it as well and I sure do hope to go again someday!

Disclaimer: This is just a travel report. I won’t go into depth about statistics and politics.
As a French-born person. The rivalry between Italy and France has always been present in my mind.
Especially in 2006 when the Italians stole the Football World Cup (according to the French people at least).
And throughout education and media, a feeling of superiority is disseminated to the French nation:
Always look up to the Germans. Always look down on the Italians.
The Italians are also often called “Ritals”
Paris feels less safe. For instance, there are people at the airport trying to grab your suitcase and put it in their taxis so you feel obliged (threatened?) to use their services. I’ve lived this experience in Paris. But not in Rome.
The Roman transportation system and airports are less stressful. Speakers do not blast reminders every 30 seconds about pickpockets, C0vid rules, baggage security rules, etc. It is much more relaxing.

“All roads lead to Rome” — Romans have built one of the most sophisticated road networks, and all of them ended in the heart of the Empire — the City of Rome. I’ve cheated and took a plane, but eventually made it to one of the most interesting cities in the world.
“All roads lead to Rome” — you’ve heard this expression before. Maybe in the history class, maybe in the tourist guide. It comes from Roman Empire times. Back then, they built one of the most sophisticated road networks, and all of the roads led to the heart of the Empire — the City of Rome. I’ve cheated and took a plane, but eventually made it to one of the most interesting cities in the world.
There are two main reasons why you want to visit Rome: history and food. Guilty as charged, I have a soft spot in my heart for both of them. Growing up I have read numerous books on the history of Ancient Rome and have always been drawn to it. Romans made a huge contribution to our everyday lives: their political, economic, cultural and social norms had set the precedence for quite a lot of ways in which our modern society works. Food is amazing and available pretty much everywhere.
Also moving forward I will start to feature some music from the country I’ve visited to set your mood while you are reading the blog. The first are italo disco heroes Marvin & Guy.
When you start planning your trip, keep in mind that you will be walking a lot. Most attractions and sights are fairly close to each other and easily accessible by foot. Although Rome has public transportation and taxis/ridesharing services, I would recommend staying in central areas and just walk around. There is nothing like getting lost in the small ancient cobblestone streets of Rome… well, as long as you have comfortable shoes ;)
With that in mind I’ve ended up choosing the hotel in the Prati neighborhood, which is located halfway between the Vatican and Historic Center. I didn’t want to be in the midst of touristy areas but still appreciated an easy access to all sights. It worked out perfectly. I would also recommend Trastevere for good nightlife. Otherwise, most areas in Historic Center will provide you with numerous accommodation options. The only exception is the area around Termini — city’s main train and bus station, it seems to have a bad reputation.
Rome has 2 international airports but you most likely will arrive at Fiumicino Airport (FCO). It is the largest airport in Rome and Italy. Technically its official name is Aeroporto Leonardo da Vinci. From there you can take an express train or bus to Termini station, the ride will take you about 30–40 mins. I’ve chosen to take a bus because it had a stop near Vatican about 5 mins away from my hotel. I was advised against taking a taxi from the airport since they tend to overcharge tourists regardless of the mandated fixed fee. Unfortunately, you can’t order Uber from airport. In general Uber allowed in the city but only for premium cars/vans. If you want a regular UberX/Lyft experience, download MyTaxi app.
Start your trip from Colosseum. It is an amphitheater built in Ancient Rome times, which used to hold 50,000 spectators. Throughout times it was modernized, rebuilt and upgraded, all the while remaining a world-famous landmark. It hosted gladiator fights, animal hunts, mock sea battles, and executions. Colosseum is the symbol of Imperial Rome and one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.
Because of its popularity, it’s a major tourist trap. If walking around as a part of the crowd where everybody is trying to take a picture of every stone is not your thing, play smart. Rule #1: buy the ticket in advance here, the same ticket will get you to the Colosseum, Forum and Palatine Hill — all while avoiding the ticket line. Rule#2: get there super early and ideally on the workday, drink espresso in the morning (we’ll come back to that) and head over right away. You goal is to be done with all of this by early afternoon and switch to drinking Aperol Spritz somewhere.
Roman Forum is the plaza in the center of Rome next to Colosseum and Palatine Hill. Back in the days it was a center of Roman life, and now surrounded by the ruins of the several ancient government buildings. But even ruins give you an idea of the majestic importance and the spirit of the place.
Palatine Hill is one of the oldest parts of the city and the original location of imperial palaces. You can walk around the territory and learn about ancient buildings. Now remember my previous point of getting there earlier. Well, we didn’t. For some reason we’ve decided to grab lunch after Colosseum and do the rest after. Rookie mistake. Don’t be like us. That Aperol Spritz not going to drink itself.
Actually, let’s talk about Aperol, Campari and all other good stuff. Italians have a strong culture of aperitifs — drinks served before the meal. Aperol is an orange liquor, and Campari is a blood orange liqueur. Both are very popular aperitifs and bases for popular aperitif cocktails: Aperol Spritz (Aperol+Prosecco+club soda) and Americano (Campari+sweet vermouth+club soda) respectively. Needless to say, there’s nothing better than sipping one (or more) of them on a warm sunny day while enjoying the view after some touristy activities. Mark my words. You’re welcome.
Finish the walk at Piazza Venezia — the home of Vittorio Emanuele II Monument. It is a monument built in honor of the first king of unified Italy in 1919. It is one of the most amazing Roman buildings and just a colossal piece of architecture, which simply hypnotizes you. That’s probably one of the reasons Mussolini used it as a place for the military parades and public speeches.
It is the second day and you’re a bit tired from walking yesterday (or drinking last night), so you need a little pick me up. Now let’s pause here for a second. Coffee is somewhat a religion in Italy, and they take it seriously. There are also some rules, which you might consider even weird, but it’s their country and their rules. Rule #1: cappuccino (and other milk espresso-based drinks) or espressos with some pastry (croissant) in the mornings, only espressos in the afternoons. Rule #2: you order coffee at the bar and drink it quickly while standing. There is also the specific way to order it: you pay first, then take your receipt to the barista, who then will make it for you. Now you’re not the first foreigner who visited Italy, and most likely you will be near the major touristy area. So, nobody will really care, if you sit down in the afternoon with a cup of latte. But it’s generally a good idea to be aware of the local customs, so you don’t look like a complete idiot in their eyes.
Once you’re energized and ready to do, start from Piazza Navona. It a famous square of three fountains: Fontana del Moro, Fountain of Neptune and Fountain of Four Rivers. You would probably recognize them from various movies or famous photos.
Your next stop is The Pantheon. It’s a former Roman temple turned to church. It’s one of the best preserved Ancient Roman buildings because of its extensive use over the years. Interesting fact: its ceiling is done in the form of a dome, and till this day its world’s largest unreinforced concrete dome, and of course there are rumors of gods helping out there.
The Trevi Fountain is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and another world-famous piece of architecture. Rumor has it, you have to drink a glass of water out of it in order to come back to Rome. Today you’ll have to put some work in to get to it through the crowd of tourists. If you do so, there’s a pretty good chance that you’ll come back.
The Spanish Steps is another iconic sight, which was originally built to connect Spanish embassy with the church on top of the hill. By then you are probably a little tired and want to sit down, relax and eat gelato. Steps sound like a perfect place to do it. Wrong. The majority of the people sitting on the steps are tourists. Italians are not huge fans of sitting on the historical monument. Recently they’ve passed a law that allows police to give out tickets up to 400 euros to ppl sitting there. It might be a very expensive gelato after all. If you’re still full of energy you can walk up to Villa Borghese Gardens, which is a public park on top of the hill.
Vatican is an independent city-state within Rome borders. It’s the smallest sovereign state in the world by area and population, and primarily exists under the governance of the Catholic Church. Again, follow the rule: sightseeing in the morning, relaxing in the afternoon. Beat the crowds by arriving earlier. Vatican’s main sights are St. Peter’s Basilica, the Sistine Chapel and Vatican Museums.
St. Peter’s Basilica is the largest church in the world and one of the holiest Catholic shrines. The entrance is free, but if you want to go up to its top and enjoy the amazing view, you’ll have to join the separate dome line and pay the fee. The Sistine Chapel is the official residence of Pope in Vatican City. The Vatican Museums are Christian art museums, which display works collected by popes over the years.
From Vatican walk to Castel Sant’Angelo. It’s cylindrical building on the right bank of the Tiber. It was originally built as a mausoleum and later used as a fortress or castle. Inside there’s a museum and you can also go to its roof and grab a bite while enjoying the view.
While doing all of the discussed sightseeing, you should not forget the second reason why you are in Rome: food. You will see it everywhere. The rule of thumb: if you see a lot of tourist crowds, do not buy food there. Walk a couple of blocks, look where locals eat. Also embrace carbs, carbs, carbs.
Several dishes you should absolutely try in Rome:
Generally, I would recommend to explore Trastevere neighborhood, which is famous for its nightlife: restaurants and bars.
Ciao!

Mille viae ducunt homines per saecula Romam
(A thousand roads lead men forever to Rome)
– Proverb.
I have been reading and hearing much about population decline in the last months — except for Israel. India takes over from China as the largest population, since it is less urbanized. Homes are found empty in Japan for years now. Predictions are made for war and growth with a declining population. Schools are shut with no students. And there lies the prophecy of Universe 25.
For those of you who do not know, Universe 25 is the 25th iteration of a behavioural study on rodents. The premise was simples: you have some rats in a utopia designed to feed and house then to perfection, no luxury spared. Having reached 2200 mice, the population founds its way to decline in less than 2 years, and it eventually completely died out.
For those who observe the unprecedented prosperity humanity has reached, Universe 25 may seem like a Morgana’s prophecy: “he is your destiny, and he is your doom”. Thankfully, we are far more complex than mice, we are not confined in an experimental setting (unless you count the planet as confined, while we do not even know the whole of it yet) and we have a knack for developing — our not-so-utopia was not handed down to us by some ET.
I would submit we have far too many differences, and though we may share in a certain decline, the history of humanity is lined with ascent and descent: empires, tribes, families, armies and much more. And as I could not keep out of everything… this has everything to do with Ancient Rome. As a matter of fact, I continue to agree and expand on prof. Oliveira Martins’ quote (translated from Portuguese): “the history of the Roman Republic is the paradigm of all known histories”. Though I would say: the history of Ancient Roman is the known paradigm of all known histories. And in that I mean the empire, the republic, the kingdom, the city, the economy, the politics, the rivalries, and everything else.
And, in this too, Rome has already declined and mostly faded, buried under the sands of time; the city has suffered an unprecedented demographic collapse from the height of what could have been a hugely dense 1.5 million people metropolis[*] by the year 100 A.D. to a few tens of thousands by the start of the Middle Ages. Adding the Western Roman Empire’s downfall to external conquest and the Byzantine slow, thousand-year, decline: one can only say the answers also lie in Rome.
When we talk about the ancient city of Rome, it is difficult to know exactly what we are talking about. That is, the city changed so much from the kings to Odoacer that one would. Are we talking about the near-empty thatched huts before the Sabine women, are we talking about unprecedented marvels of marble and stone from all over the Mediterranean or are we talking about the mythical decadent figure bestowed unto us by artists and thinkers from the Renascence onward?
Well, we are talking about all of that, of course, but we cannot properly talk about all of that at the same time, lest we lose chronological sense.
Keeping that in mind, let us be orderly and start at the beginning. Rome would not look like a booming metropolis at the time of the kings. It had not sprawled over the seven hills, it had no Egyptian grain to distribute, no treasures of the mysterious East and none of the major marks (the Flavian Theatre, the Thermæ, the temples built by the greatest generals and so on). We are talking about a civilisation that is, in sooth, yet to be — though now we know it indeed was.
We may consider that the challenge posed to the Roman Kingdom and most of the republican times was there. A mission existed, be it to overcome Carthage, to attain general success or to rule the Sea. What I mean is: there is no place here for a weak, young society to ever act like a decadent empire. The opposite, in fact. There lies no path to power in imitating power. Brazil is an example of such a failure in our times: a country that looks up to “Scandinavian socialism”[†] and seeks to spend just like Sweden, while providing zero of the ambiance that gave way to Swedish prosperity — and we are not talking about an empire here. Needless to say, Brazil is not in the highway to prosperity, but threading the dangerous road to serfdom.
At any point, the fact is Rome stood far from the spoiling utopia of Universe 25 at this moment of its history.
After the fall of Carthage, we might say Rome has become the leading empire of its time, and of all time, we might add. That is, taking on the mantle of the cosmopolis, Rome is the universal empire that weaves the very legitimacy of the concept. And it did enjoy its time in the Sun, much like the USA after World War Two. Using the population of the actual city of Rome as a proxy, we must note that the population seems to have peaked by the end of the first century A.D., according to some estimations.
The precise movements of Roman prosperity are yet not detailed to be discussed, and are also not the main point of this essay, so here comes the question: what happened after that? Well, my readings indicate that the population fell just as quickly as it grew. It is important to observe that this was not a childless society. Romans died from plague and war; they moved back to the rural areas as Rome was politically and economically voided — and it would be possible that those who remained had less children, but who knows.
The point is: the urban population fell, and by the end of Antiquity, many estimates agree that it would not have even a hundred thousand people — and that it would continue to dim well into Medieval Times. We are talking here about a much more dangerous city, abandoned by the imperial structure, lacking a Senatorial class (or any such wealthy people who could turn anywhere they went into Monaco), partially abandoned and materially depreciating. This is no city of wonders, commerce, and opportunity. It is a hollow dream, voided by the decay and overextension of empire.
And for more than a thousand years, Rome would remain the seat of the papacy, de facto and de jure a Christian City (identified more by the Church than with the Byzantines over the Adriatic), mostly reduced to minor Italian squabbles, and depending on greater kingdoms to call upon its influence.
It is no mystery what the ancient Romans did: they fled to their farms. Large and small, senator or bum, the wandering search of safety, shelter and a life led the Romans to the countryside — and led properties to the hand of powerful men, who could defend the land/fiefs and the previous owners, now their servants or vassals. One might take note of the wording, but it is better to say it fully: feudalism had kicked down the door.
It is thus that some questions arise:
i. What was happening to population and fertility when feudalism began?
ii. Did moving away from Rome make less babies or more?
iii. How relevant was the barbarian influx?
iv. How and why did things change again?
One might observe that these are not trivial questions. To answer them accurately would require precise data from more than a thousand years ago, and we do not have that. In many ways, that may be a problem since the absence of this information makes way for all sort of fantasy storytelling, but let us propose some thoughts:
It is likely that fertility fell by the end of Antiquity, as that trend is observed for general times of crises, but it is unclear if that had any meaningful role to play in the social or economic setting. We know, as an example, that individual wealth grew at the time of the Black Death, since it led to concentration of inheritance and the scarcity of labour. It would be interesting to see how that would have worked out a thousand years prior. It is also not clear if there was a difference in urban and rural fertility, as there exists nowadays.
[*] 1.5 million people is the highest number found during my research on the topic, but I am not subscribing to that number, just using it as a reference for the scale of the collapse.
[†] It is unfortunately the case for Brazilian politics, that the Marxist/socialist left (allied to Maduro, Cuba, Ortega, …) conflates the Scandinavian political and economic setting with “socialism that works”, at the same time using the ludicrous claim that the USSR, Cambodia, and other such bloodthirsty regimes were not “real socialism” (at best, there are times when we can hear people defending gulags or saying they never existed in the first place). We should observe that such claims have been publicly refuted not only by simple facts, but also by Scandinavian leaders, but referring more commonly to claims made by American politicians: <https://www.vox.com/2015/10/31/9650030/denmark-prime-minister-bernie-sanders>
P.S.: the above is an informal essay, please do not consider it conclusive, fully researched or based.

When I was a kid I watched a movie called “Roman Holiday”. The magnificent and enchanting scenery shown in the film evoked my longing for Rome.
Years later, I had the opportunity to visit the “Eternal City” (with more than 2500 years of history). It was 2003, and my husband and I decided to take a week-long vacation to Rome.
As with my other travel stories, here I will continue to talk about some of the little things I observed and experienced in Rome.
1. The airport bus couldn’t open its door and a ‘free’ subway ride
One afternoon in March, we took off from Düsseldorf, Germany, with our infant son, and arrived at Rome’s Fiumicino airport about two hours later.
March is the best season in Rome, the weather is neither cold nor hot. We came from still chilly Germany to warm Rome and felt comfortable. But soon we were overwhelmed by what happened next.
After waiting at the airport for a long time, the bus to the city finally arrived. Before we could react, the crowd swarmed and filled the bus in an instant.
Oddly, the middle door of the bus wouldn’t open, so our pram had to squeeze in through the narrow front door.

If you only have a few days in Rome, as I did, it’s important to see as much history and culture as possible. In our last post, we showed you our ideal day in the heart of Rome, Piazza Novona — the best espresso (according to Romans) , gelato, markets, and the Pantheon. In bite-size pieces, here’s our version of the best things to do in Rome in 48 hours.
I. Piazza della Repubblica: Piazza della Repubblica is a beautiful semi-circullar piazza with the Fountain of the Naiads in the center, and the Basilica of St. Mary of the Angels and Martyrs across from the fountain. I encourage you to look inside the Basilica, inside is a beautiful bronze meridian solar line, designed by Francesco Bianchini, with marble depictions of the zodiacs.
II. The Colosseum — because no trip to Roma is complete without visiting the Colosseum, the icon of Imperial Rome. Right next door to the Colosseum is the Roman Forum, the heart of ancient Rome. Both ruins are must see when visiting Rome, and you can purchase the Roma Pass, which gives free entry to both the Forum and the Colosseum.
III. The Spanish Steps (or the walk to the Spanish Steps): The Spanish Steps is a monumental set of 135 steps, made famous by the 1953 classic Roman Holiday, with Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck. The base of the steps can be overcrowded with tourists, so I suggest arriving north of the steps by Via Sistina and taking the time to visit the shops along the way, and admire the charming architecture of the streets of Rome.
IV. Villa Borghese: Villa Borghese is an extensive garden that was built in 1605 by Cardinal Borghese as a party villa. It has many villas built as summer residences for Popes and nobles, but is now most visited for the Galleria Borghese, which has sculptures by Bernini, and paintings by Raphael and Caravaggio. Buy tickets in advance because this is a popular museum, and aside from the Vatican, contains some of the best works in Rome. If you don’t make it to the museum, or want to spend an extra hour or so exploring the park, there is much to see, such as the Sienna Square, National Gallery of Modern Art, or the Temple of Aesculapius. My favorite part of the park was the view from the Villa Medici. which offers stunning panoramic views of Rome (above).
V. Vatican City: The Vatican can be made a half-day trip or a whole day excursion. There is so much art in the Vatican Museums, and because of the amount of tourists, I recommend allotting quite a few hours to see all the art the Vatican has to offer. There are four Sculpture Museums, a Painting Collection, a museum of Modern Religious Art, and a historical museum and art gallery. The Vatican’s extensive art collection started over 500 years ago with the purchase of Laocoon and his Sons, a marble sculpture found in a vineyard near the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome. The Sistine Chapel cannot be missed, I could spend hours looking up at the masterpiece of a ceiling, Michelangelo’s greatest work. The heart of the Vatican is St. Peter’s Basilica, one of the world’s largest churches, and the most renowned work of Renaissance architecture. Words cannot even describe the magnificence of St. Peter’s Basilica, and you must see Michelangelo’s Pieta located inside the Basilica.

When I travel, I like to seek out authentic local experiences. This time someone heard my prayers and decided to give me one of the most classic local southern European experiences ever on my first day — a public transportation strike. So I walked everywhere.
First impressions:The area around the train station was pretty gritty, there was graffiti on every vertical surface, litter all over the ground, and…sketchy people standing around. But this is pretty standard around big train stations everywhere in the world, Paris North Station is also similar, but Rome definitely outperforms Paris in terms of grittiness. Unlike the perfectly manicured buildings in Paris, Rome feels more “wild” and unrestrained.
Roman traffic deepened such an impression. Walking on a large boulevard, I reached a roundabout where many large roads met. In the middle of the road, there was a small police stop, with two middle-aged Italian policewomen directing traffic. They were doing a good job, but they were a little…unpredictable. Literally in the middle of a green light with cars pouring onto the intersection, one of them strolled confidently into the middle of the road, and held out her hand firmly to stop traffic. The cars stopped. They were not in straight lines. Some cars backed out of the intersection. Everything was still for a moment. And then the chaos reignited. I had no idea what was going on, and to be honest I was a little bemused, but I calmly crossed the street and kept walking. Traffic in Rome is quite a comedy. Not all major intersections have traffic lights or crosswalks, but that doesn’t stop people from darting across busy traffic; and even when there are traffic lights, that doesn’t stop cars and motorbikes from sneaking across. On paper, this sounds like Paris, but I assure you it’s different. Parisian drivers don’t open the windows to shout expressively at you with both hands gesturing wildly. Rome has a more comical disorganization, it’s like a Mr. Bean who knows what he’s doing. It’s hard to explain.
“Parla inglese?” It’s been a while since I’ve been in a country where I don’t speak the local language, and I’d forgotten how frustrating but also how amusing that can be. I’d pre-booked entrance tickets to the Coliseum, Forum, and Palantine Hill to avoid waiting in long lines. I’d read the fare conditions closely, and realized that I could get in for free with my Tufts in Paris “student of Art History” ID. Since mine was a discounted ticket, I had to go to the ticket office to verify my status before going in.
At the ticket office : (original conversation, imagine strong iTaLiAn accent) - Ticket lady: You reserved a free ticket, you need pay 12 euros for the adult ticket.- Me: (confused because I’d also reserved an audio guide for 7.5 euros, but in the moment I forgot what the 7.5 euros was for, and also forgot why I got a “free” ticket) I thought I paid 7.5 euros for a ticket, why are you saying it’s free?- Ticket lady: That is for the audio guide. For the entrance fee, you need to pay 12 euros because you are not an EU citizen. You need an ID or passport.- Me : (in my mind — how do you know I’m not an EU citizen??? and then I remembered why I got discounted tickets and started taking out my Tufts in Paris Art History ID) I’m a student — - Ticket lady: (interrupting) No student ticket, only adult 12 euros.- Me: But I study art history.- Ticket lady: Architecture?- Me: No, art history.- Ticket lady: Not architecture?- Me: No, art history!- Ticket lady: Ohhh ok, ~art history~ I see, sorry but only students of architecture and history of art can get free tickets.- Me: (ready to faint — art history and history of art are the same thing!)I didn’t want to argue with her anymore so I just pressed my ID against the glass.- Ticket lady: (sees my ID that says “l’histoire de l’art”) Oh ok! Then that’s good!
Good thing I insisted and didn’t cave in to paying 12 euros, otherwise I’d have lost many gelatos and that would be very sad :(
After an afternoon, I have the impression that Rome is a little less organized and less glamorous than Paris, but with more character and personality. It’s like Paris is an elegant, uptight lady, whereas Rome is a carefree singing guitarist with tattered clothes. But this is just day 1, maybe my impressions will change after 5 days! :)

Dramatic titles for me are an art form and today we are about to talk about something with no relation to any of the cities mentioned above but points to critical moments in all. Abstract titles are my way of art and ironically they a mosaics that my mind paints.
Rome was not built in a day; this a saying that has been repeated for a long time, and will also be passed to generations as long as humanity remains. It is true, Rome as an empire has been around Before Christ and After Christ hence, it is obvious that it was not a day’s job. I think it is more important to take the principles of Roman Construction and apply them in our lives.
The senior Pastor at Life Church said something in a sermon I watched, He said “When we are born we look like our Parents, when we die we look like our choices ”. That word struck me and I who enjoy a largely sedentary lifestyle imposed on me by the nature of my career went for a much-needed walk. I live in Ajah (an area in Lagos) and I have lived here for a while now (except when I was in Uni), I have seen development occur with time and how places that would have you scared now look like a jewel.
However it was not always so, I recalled and remembered what it used to be like when I walked towards a now abandoned house, an abandoned site, and a poorly maintained sand-filled road. When I began to see these buildings and roads, got the burden to paint them with words as it cuts across various niches.
Knowledge is the most pleasant and annoying thing to have, it is a double edge sword. Ardan Labs a software company that has a training arm has a saying, “If you think it’s expensive to hire a professional, just wait until you hire an amateur” and it is true about learning, “If you think it’s expensive to train to be a professional, try ignorance”. Like every good Lawyer, I will present facts that could be misconstrued but I hope I paint pictures that will live an impression on you.
Pompei is/was a city that existed in Italy under the Roman empire that got buried under ash from an Erupted volcano called Mount Vesuvius. They thrived as a City till a threat possibly called everyone who lived in that city.
Knowledge as a double edge sword had me asking how did people come to settle around an Active Volcano. Did they have no Geophysicist, no Geologist in ancient Rome that could inform people of the threat to life? Ignorance which was not an active choice of the people of Pompeii levelled and buried an entire city.
Atlantis is presented as a lost city buried somewhere in the ocean, although scientific inquiry has presented facts that Plato’s work which mentioned Atalantis in his work Timaeus and Critias was not a total representation of life but an allegory to drive home a point. As such science concludes that Atlantis never existed. Well, I am not debating science but Intend to accept for the basis of this at Atlantis did exist.
A beautiful city that got buried as a result of earthquakes, again if Atlantis really did exist why did its people decide to settle on an Island? If they had the foresight of the future would they have settled there? I would argue and present an engineer's answer “It depends”, however, the law of averages agrees that if they settled elsewhere and the earthquake happens again the island may sink or it would not, depending on its averages (in this case the intensity of the quake).
These two cities albeit one being a farce and the other did exist, are demonstrations of how knowledge gaps are our undoing. I looked at buildings that were the houses that tickled my need to be rich and a few of them looked like the have sunk. I remember coming to Dad’s house while it was constructed and its foundation was so high. My dad imagine the height of the road ( in the future ) which I felt was nearly insane. Looking at houses around that looked like they had sank and will still sink I began to understand that an intricate part of knowledge and building (not actual buildings) with it is the ability to preempt actions, develop more knowledge and respond accordingly. Today the height of the road is at least a level higher than my Dad anticipated. There are 5 new buildings around my Dad’s house and they seem taller because of the new ground level the foundation was laid, luckily for my Folks their house did not sink or sink as much, but this ability to preempt the future or an unforeseen circumstance struck me as a key to building.
Recently I switched my work codebase from an in-route logic-dependent application to a repository pattern which was initializing access to the Database (DB) in the Repositories, that was an excellent design for me at the time, the way the DB was accessed was flawless and I felt nothing could go wrong.
There has been a sprint-like approach my team had imbibed to produce the product that had been blueprinted (designed). In this fire brigade approach, I discovered that the access to the DB was a poor decision, my ignorance of this was glaring and staring me down and I had to come up with a solution. I spent 16 hours working across two days to come up with a solution that resolves the DB via the Framework’s method. I am sure it feels like I have lost you, apologies. Enough of Tech detailed talk layered with backend remarks. My ignorance meant that if this product went live based on my decision and knowledge at the time there was going to be an epic fail.
Luckily for me, I saved the day by experimenting and drawing fact-based solutions from a source of truth (FastAPI’s documentation), my teammates attested to an uptick in performance across my system. There is a word for if that situation above got to production and I have to manage the such situation and resolve it. It is called Technical debt. The lack of knowledge with regards to something intricate means that we would not deliver at the optimal mark in that regard.
A lot is happening across the world, the more we look the more we see that no one really has it all figured out, communities, countries, sports teams, people and automated processes. Knowledge is not a destination it is a continuous place. Knowledge is the refiner's fire, through its acquisition we realize how flawed our previous implementations are.
We do this by becoming like Rome.
Rome seems to be a wonder of the world, because, at some point in our lives, we hear Rome was not built in a day to persuade us to do the work. The idea however is to communicate to us the Kaizenic nature of Rome’s Architecture. There are Ancient structures that are still up today, such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and the Roman amphitheatre among a few which I know.
These structures are borne out of a place of improvement, the first structure architects would design would give them the cringe if they look at it after years of practice and work, this is why tech solutions are versioned, and this is why we have a Corolla 1998 and 2023 version. It is the Kaizenic nature of constant improvement, this motion is borne out of a place of constant reflection and a zest for the better.
This is why Veterans in any field are better than young blood, this is why the best coaches are people who actively did what they are coaching about (Albeit not at the grandest of stages).
The Roman buildings and the empire did not take over the whole world in one day, it was a gradual continuous action that became the empire. Some battles, some wars, some years of peace. History’s recounts are always fast and opaquely divulging to the perspective of time and timing. A good example as we ride out on the last strokes of this art, are football players.
A lot of these players dedicate their lives to this sport, childhood, teenage, and even their youth, why will Haland not be a deadly striker? Why will he also not lose a penalty, how come he could he can easily move on.
Time is an important perspective to everything including knowledge, I hated balancing chemical equations in secondary school but I loved it in the early years of Uni.
The most important thing these buildings have thought me is if we are not dead yet then we can become better, your next project should be better than the previous one, that is the only way to show growth and become Rome.
When we are born we are like our parents, but in death, we are our choices. I live you with a wise word on life, we will always have regrets in life, these are an opportunity cost of opportunities forgone. The rule is to remember regret is a feature of life, not a Bug.
Till next time.

Before I begin, I would like you to know how why I am sharing this information with you, since each author has their purpose and I am sure that you are curious about mine. Why should you believe me, an American girl still in high school? For starters, I am not tied to any organization and I am not trying to sell you anything. I am not only writing this to make your trip planning easier, but I am also writing this for myself. I have also added my own personal experience to guide you. I hope that while recording my own memories, I can aid you in planning your trip to Rome so you can have the best experience.
Most people visit Rome in the summer months when the blazing sun illuminates the historical center. My family (of four) decided to avoid the crowds and fly to the city in late December. I was tasked with the most time-consuming but also the most important job: creating the itinerary. My job consisted of booking reservations for the famed Colosseum and Vatican Museums, finding small gelato shops and fancy restaurants, and locating more authentic Italian respites.
The biggest downside was that there wasn’t much information about what Rome was like in the winter so we didn’t know what clothes to pack. According to the weather predictors, the sun set around 5:45 pm which was very early. Also, the temperature ranged from 35°F to 60°F. We weren’t sure about how to dress; should we wear t-shirts? Coats? We honestly had to improvise, so we packed a bit of everything.
Now, when I was trying to plan the trip out, I did not have such a wealth of information in one place. Even more annoying, many of the websites I found were advertising tickets much more expensive than the actual ones. I spent many hours on TripAdvisor, browsing through the many forums. It was difficult to find truly unbiased information. In total, I spent many hours on hundreds of websites trying to figure out how to best visit Rome and what to know about customs in Italy. Of course, there wasn’t information about everything, so we ended up learning a lot of lessons from our unexpected encounters.
I also had a tough time with scheduling. While researching, I discovered that Italy was a lot different compared to the suburbs where I reside. It takes about an hour to walk from one end to the other. This posed a problem for me while I was planning; I wasn’t really used to city life, so I didn’t have a good sense of how long it would take to walk certain distances. I also had no ideas as to how long we would spend at each site. Would we spined at the Spanish Steps? Five minutes? One hour? What about the Pantheon? Maybe we would have extra time. Maybe we would be rushing everywhere. We really just had to wait and see. Now I know you’re curious to see how the trip turned out.
Overall, Rome was a great experience for me. I got to see the historical sites outside of textbooks and class and I was taken back by how huge everything is. You really won’t be able to appreciate the genius of the ancient Romans and the Renaissance artists until you get to observe the great works with your own eyes. Since we visited in December, we got to enjoy the Christmas lights and trees set up all across the city. And of course, the pasta, pizza, and gelato were all very delicious. There was a lot of variety at restaurants and cafes so I got to try things that were very atypical of my American lifestyle (Nutella pizza or fried zucchini flowers).
Now onto the specifics (click here to see a shortened version):
Here’s what I would advise: pack layers. We didn’t realize that most of the time we would be out when it was cold, so we didn’t pack very well. Only my mom did, so I had to borrow some of her clothes. It is really cold in the morning up to about 10 am and after sunset around 6 pm. Here’s what kept me warm:
This guide should have covered extensively all the little things you know about visiting Rome. Should you have any more questions, do let me know. Otherwise, I do hope this helped and safe travels!

From Bari I headed across Italy to Pompeii and an overnight stop in the Bay of Naples.
There’s not much that can be said — at least, not much that’s profound — about Pompeii that hasn’t been said, better, a dozen times before.
It’s been a world-famous tourist destination for literally centuries — an unmissable stop on the original Grand Tours.
So my main observations are pretty unoriginal.
My first: it’s big — really big. I trudged around for five hours and didn’t see it all.
As is always the case in places like this, the choking crowds of tourists quickly thinned out, observing the inverse square law of laziness.
My other unoriginal observation is that it’s amazingly well preserved. It’s not in obviously worse nick than the 30-year-old ruins we had seen in Mostar a few weeks earlier.
In a neat parallel to the low-value service industry focus of today’s Pompeii — surrounded by snack bars, restaurants and hotels — the ancient ruins of Pompeii show that not that much was different two millennia ago.
The economy of Roman Pompeii revolved, clearly, around having a good time.
Leisure centres — sorry, Roman baths. Sports centres — sorry, amphitheatres. Takeaways — sorry, thermopolia. Really, the tourist industry of southern Italy hasn’t changed that much in two millennia. The ancient ruined versions don’t even look that different from their modern counterparts.
After an overnight stop in Torre del Greco — in a charming farm with half-arsed service and unannounced restaurant closure — the car, which had been complaining of some unspecified lurgy since Albania (through the medium of beeps and a flashing orange spanner icon), finally decided that it was oil that it wanted.
The car had been bonked pretty hard on the underside in the rock-strewn ploughed field that passed for a car park at Bogove waterfall near Berat a few days earlier. Had I punctured the oil pan?
To make matters worse, I’d told a local tweenager trying to shake me down for a couple of lek to ‘watch my car’ to get lost. Had he sabotaged the car in revenge?
Was the car slowly bleeding out? Was it leaving a puddle of motor oil at every stop?
Was the motor, pistons unlubricated, grinding itself down into iron filings with every mile driven?
Being prone to anxiety, this is not the sort of thing I am particularly good at remaining relaxed about.
The anxiety was not improved by noticing liquid dripping from the underside of the car while waiting outside the gates of the guest house (the manager taking his sweet time — more than half an hour — to actually come and let me in).
Leaving a tarpaulin under the car overnight calmed nerves somewhat when it emerged the next morning without any oil stains at all. The dripping was… water from having cleaned the windscreen.
And, using a dipstick for the first time since my driving test, I concluded the oil level in the engine was just about tolerable — admittedly when parked on a slope.
My mind put slightly, if not entirely, at ease, I powered north towards Rome, where, after some not-entirely-enjoyable traffic, and quite possibly some low traffic neighbourhood-related traffic infractions, I parked the car underground for a few days.
I’ve been asked a ton of times why I can speak Italian. The answer I usually give — my dad’s a retired Italian literature professor and I grew up hearing it — isn’t really true, or at least, it’s far from a full explanation.
It’s not like hearing grown men talking about Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio is a great draw for a kid.
And I hardly ever went to Italy in childhood either — aside from two trips to Veneto, summer holidays were always in France.
It’s when I was a student that I became obsessed with Italy.
Over a couple of summer trips, I came to love all the ways in which it’s the best country in the world by a country mile. Nowhere else packs in as much good food, history, architecture and culture.
I came to love, too, all the other ways in which Italy powers through its manifest dysfunctions, shaking off flaws that would condemn lesser countries to failure and obscurity. I even enjoy — no, enjoy isn’t quite the right word, am entertained by — Italian politics.
And so, at a loose end the summer after graduating, having failed to line up a job (worse was to come when I lined up one I hated), I signed up for introductory Italian classes.
My ear trained by hearing the tedious Dante talk, my interest piqued by summer trips, and with the headstart that comes from French grammar and vocabulary, I found Italian ridiculously easy to learn.
After a couple of terms and fairly minimal effort, I was speaking far better Italian than I ever did German, despite six years’ hard slog through school.
I’ve been to Italy most years ever since.
Which makes it all the more odd that this was actualy my first trip to Rome.
It didn’t disappoint.
Not just because St Peter’s is every bit as extraordinary as its reputation. It feels corny to say, but it’s a genuinely awe-inspiring and — whisper it — spiritual place.
Not just because the ancient sites — the Forum, the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo — are so impressive.
Not even because the Pantheon is even more astonishing than I expected, and the architectural highlight of the entire trip.
In addition to that, it’s also everything I usually like about Italy — from the great food, to the nice atmosphere, to the walkable cityscape.
It’s also got the distinctive typography on its shop signs that you see everywhere in Italy and nowhere outside it.
(It’s also while in Rome that I got the good news about a funding bid I’d written just before heading off. This prompted an ill-advised but enjoyable number of Campari spritzes on a very nice café terrace in Trastevere, and a well-earned headache the next morning.)
After resting the ailing car for a few days, I made a detour to a Peugeot garage in the suburbs for the oil it was demanding, then headed north.

New theories about a mystery hundreds of years old and a secret known to few Romans that was not meant to be revealed
It was 8 a.C. when the famous poet Ovid fell out of favor with the Emperor Augustus, who exiled him, without the confiscation of his goods, to Tomis (now Costance), a small port on the Black Sea.
But what was the cause of this great punishment for such a famous and important character for Rome?
Let’s try to give an answer to this question, taking into account the new theories.
Publio Ovidio Nasone was one of the most important Roman poets, one of the main exponents of Latin literature and, above all, of the elegiac poetry.
- Elegiac Poetry: lyrical composition united by specific metric form and by arguments that were opposed to the epic with a subjective and autobiographical setting, interpreted as a lament.
Ovid was the author of many works and his fame was as great during his lifetime as afterwards: his style and his themes were taken up by Dante, Petrarca, Shakespeare and many other.
His most famous work is “The Metamorphoses” whose the best known story is Apollo and Daphne’s myth.
So, what was the reason for his RELEGATIO (exile)? It still is a mystery today as the clues we have come almost exclusively from Ovid himself: what we know for sure is that the poet was exiled by the Emperor Augustus, but his successor, the Emperor Tiberius, maintained the punishment.
The fame of Ovid, as mentioned, during his life was very great and therefore the reason behind his exile must have been very serious.
Let’s see here what his “error” may have it been, according to the scholars, ‘till recent times.
- An illecit relationship with Giulia Maggiore, the daughter of the Emperor Augustus, of which he sang in the “Amores”, under the pseudonym of “Corinna”
- Perhaps he favored the relationship between Giulia Minore, granddaughter of Augustus and daughter of Giulia Maggiore, and Senator Decimo Giunio Silanus, causing them to commit the crime of adultery
- He discovered illecit dealings of Emperor Augustus at his court
- He snooped about the private conducts of Livia Drusilla, wife of Augustus
- He partecipated in a conspiracy against Tiberius
It was precisely in the year of the exile that Ovid had achieved his maximus success thanks to “The Metamorphoses”, his masterpiece, in which he recounts the transformation of the protagonists into plants, animals or objects.
Ovid was considered a libertine and wasn’t well seen by the Augustan political side, very traditionalist and conservative, because he used to criticized the two fundamental pillars of the Roman society: Religion and Family.
But it was not this that caused the exile, but something that as a punishment had the “capital punishment” which, however, Emperor Augustus commuted into exile (as Ovid himself tells us).
But it really was one of the aforementioned actions that condemned Ovid? What about the “carmina”?
As mentioned before, the reason we have listed ahve been proposed by scholars until recently, almost forgetting the “carmina” implied and the fact that this could be connected to the “error” and not be a separate thing.
At the time of his exile, Ovid was writing the “Fasti”, an epic poem aimed at revisiting Roman festivals and rites: there would have been 12 books, one for each month of the year.
Halfway through the work, the order for the RELEGATIO arrived and the work was interrupted, nver to be resumed again.
- A clue -
At the beginning of the fifth book, where the poet researches the etymological origins of the name of the month of May and at a certain point, Ovid has the Muse Calliope (the poetry’s muse) tell the backgrounds of Rome’s foundation and she speaks of the constellation of the Pleiades.
In Latin literature, the importance that Ovid gave to this constellation when speaking about Rome’s origin is unusual: no one before him had mentioned neither Maia nor teh Pleiades in this context.
Certainly Ovid would never have allowed himself to invent something extraneous to the tradition regarding the birth of Rome (neither did the non-romans writers or Rome’s enemies).
- Was, therefore, a forbidden subject that Ovid wrote about? -
We must now take a step back and tell talk about an event that took place about 100 years earlie: the story of Quinto Valerio Sorano who was senteced to death for revealing the secret name of Rome.
Servius and Plutarch too wrote of the sacrilege commited by Soranus, a tribune of the plebs, poet and grammarian of vast erudition, dear friend of Cicero, whose sentence was death by crucifixion.
A certain reason, that we know for sure, for which the Romans kept the real name of the Urbe (other latin name for Rome) hidden and secret is the EVOCATIO (evocation), a rite for which the patron god of a city was invoked, pronouncing its name, in front of its walls during a siege: knowing the name of the god was the equivalent to seizing the essence of the city and subduing it.
- The Pleiades -
The Pleiades are a cluster of stars located in the constellation of Taurus, 440 light years away from the Earth and includes about 3000 stars, but the eye can see only 6 to 12 of them.
These stars are mentioned by many ancient peoples and it is considered that they thought there were 7 of them. They are found depicted in the Nebra Disc, the oldest surviving depiction of the night sky, dating back to 1600 b.C. .
Also according to the Greeks, the Pleiades were 7: Daughters of Atlas and Pleirone (daughter of Tetis and Ocean) their names were “Alcione and Merope, Celeno and Taigete, Elettra and Sterope, together with the most holy Maia”. (Cicero, “Aratea”)
At this point a consideration needs to be made.
In the ancient world what was sacred on earth was often a reflection of what was in the sky: for example, Mount Taigete (Sparta) took its name from the Pleiade mother of Sparta’s “founder”, Lacedaemon.
Here, as the Roman encyclopedist Marcus Terentium Varro: “Where now stands Roma, there was once the Septimountius, so called for the number of mountains that the city later included within its walls.”
We know that the Septimountius does not correspond to the Seven Hills of Rome, but the concept of the Seven Hills could itself be the result of a schematization that reduced the number of the hills of the territory that extends on the left bank of the Tiber.
This semplification would seem pointless, but perhaps the aim was to make the hills correspond to the Seven Pleiades; in fact, even the arrangement of the hills seems to respect that of the “seven stars pleiades”.
The Palatine Mount, on which Romulus traced the furrow of the Urbe, corresponds to “the most holy Maia”.
In the story of the foundation, we find another probable allusion to the Pleiades: Remus on the Aventine Mount and Romulus on Palatine Mount saw, respectively, 6 and 12 bird flying (as mentioned 6 and 12 are the Pleiades visible from the Earth by eye).
We must remember that the Pleaides are part of the constellation of Taurus, whose zodiac sign begins on April 21st… The foundation of Rome has as date April 21st 753 b.C. .
It cannot be excluded that even the number of the Seven King of Rome originated, rather than from a historical foundation, from the need for sacred numerology in which the number “seven” holds a prominent place.
A small detail to keep in mind, is that Ovid was originally from Sulmona, a city at the feet of the Maiella Mountain Massif, consacrated preciselt to the Pleaide Maia.
It is therefore possible that an educated Roman, starting from the passage written by Ovid, was able to understand that the city born from Romulus’ furrow, was consecrated to the Pleiade Maia, considered by Ovid himself, the most beautiful one.
For the ancient Romans, the Lares were divinities who protected and safeguarded the individual, the family and the home. The divinity that is introduced in the verses is called “Bona Dea” (good goddess) and it too had a protective function.
Even the real name of the “Bona Dea” was never to be spoken; the first to reveal it, was Macrobius in the V century a.C. by whuch time the pagan world was almost at an end.
Macrobius confirms that behind the “Bona Dea” was hidden Maia.
It is therefore no coincidence that Ovid dedicates the opening line of the book of and about May to her.
The sentence in the graphic specifies a relationship between Vulcan and Maia, in which the god offered a pregnant sow as a sacrifice to Maia, every 1st of May, so that the earth would be pregnant with fruit.
Vulcan represented the protective fire; this places him at Maia’s service in the defense of the city.
The juxtaposition between Maia and the “Bona Dea” allows us to see from a new perspective an episode that took place decades earlier, which involved, among others, Cicero and Cesare.
P. Clodio. Pulcro, one of the most discussed characters in the entire Roman history, on the night of the 4th of December in 62 b.C., disguised himself as a woman to secretly participate in a very secret ritual of the cult of the “Bona Dea” to which the women of the aristocracy were responsible, which was carried out privately in the residence of a high magistrate’s wife and in the presence of the latter and the Vestals (thus indicates the importance of this rite): that night the rite took place in the home of Cesare, that at the time was Pontifex Maximus.
Pulcro was discovered and underwent a trial in which he risked the death penalty, whilst against him testified Cicero.
Cesare, who as Pontifex Maximus, was one of the few who knew the truth about Rome’s secret name, divorced his wife after that deplorable episode. This shows how important the rite was.
If naming the true patroness of Rome was such a serious crime, why didn’t Augustus kill Ovid?
Calliope’s speech seems to have been cut: in fact, she never mentions Romulus, while the other two muses whom Ovid makes speak before her, do it.
It is therefore possible that Emperor Augustus had the compromised verses eliminated. Those were the verses in which it was stated that Romulus gave the secret name to Rome (a fact present in many latin and non-latin sources), following the prophecy on the place where Rome would be born.
In conclusion, Emperor Augustus granted clemency because Ovid, it seems, never mentioned Maia’s name directly.
But there were, probably, also political reasons for this choice.

Word of advice number one: when you next go on vacation, don’t wear new shoes on the flight.
Why? Well, it could be that the airline looses your luggage and you are doomed to wear the same pair of new shoes for days on end. And your feet will not forgive you.
Word of advice number two: Never, ever, go to Rome in August. Not if you value your life and well being in general. And especially not if you are adverse to high temperatures.
Our friends had warned us against this.
“Don’t go, it is too hot!”, they said.
“Never in August. You’ll die from the heat!”, they warned.
Did we listen? Well, of course not.
Our logic?
“Well, we always say we won’t go in August and that we’ll go some other time, but then we never go”, said my partner. I agreed. My partner was right. We always say we’ll go some other time, but then we never do.
So a couple of years ago we decided to go to Rome and check out the Eternal City.
E t e r n a l mistake on our part!
After paying Vueling Airlines (a low cost airline) for 2 pieces of luggage, we arrived at Rome’s Fiumicino Airport with a slight delay, but no suitcases.
We only discovered this after waiting for our bags for over an hour at belt #9.
I went to the baggage handling company in charge of our flight (turns out there’s more than one. Blessed capitalism!) and they told us they had no record of our bags on their system.
Yes, having been to the country in the past, in fact, as recently as last June, my first thought was “typical Italian efficiency”, but I was wrong to think that. The problem was not typical Italian efficiency, it was typical Spanish negligence.
As we would find out the next day, the bags had never left Barcelona.
The Italian handler made us fill a form; he put our details into the computer, and sent us off on our less than merry way with a reference number which, we would later discover, was incorrect.
Although no consolation at all, we were not the only people without luggage on our flight, there was, at least, one other.
So there we were at Rome’s airport with a driver waiting to take us into town for 50 Euros, something we thought would be a good idea since we didn’t know the city and we wanted not to worry about the bags.
He was very nice, and if he was upset at having waited for over an hour, he didn’t let on.
We got into his Ford Focus and made our way to the Città Eterna.
I have to say that the drive went pretty well, and that the country side was not exactly very pretty. It was, all in all, a bit odd.
First we were on a highway, then, after a while, we found ourselves in what can only be describe as ‘leafy suburbs’.
He didn’t take any major roads and, instead, chose one-way roads with large, tall, walls, behind which I can only imagine must hide beautiful private villas.
It was a long while before we approached something which resembled the outskirts of a large city.
Once there what we saw first was the usual dim urban landscape, typical of any major European city post 1950.
Large, ugly, square, brick and concrete buildings, with many stores along the way selling mostly urban goods: fast food joints, urban clothing stores, ugly furniture shops, and the odd newspaper stand.
Still, we were excited to be in Rome.
I mean, R O M E !!
Right?
Then, suddenly, something which would happen again and again -though we didn’t know it at the time- occurred: when we least expected it, and just before we entered a tunnel, out of the corner of our left eyes, we caught a glimpse of St. Peter’s, in The Vatican.
This was unexpected because we had thought that we would view that particular monument going up the Via Della Concilliazione and into St. Peter’s Square, like almost everyone else.
But it was not to be. We quickly crossed the Tiber and drove down the Corso Vittorio Emanuelle II and into our hotel near the Campo de Fiori.
We paid our driver, gave him a tip, then checked in.
The hotel was ok. The recepcionist was not really friendly and did that thing which so often happens in Europe, he spoke as if HE was doing you a favor.
As if HE was paying for you to stay at the hotel. Not rude, just a bit…what’s the word… condescending and aloof.
Regardless, we had gone to Rome to enjoy the place and that is what we wanted to do. So we quickly forgot about him.
We had asked for a room with a balcony, and they gave us that, which was nice. But we soon discovered that the a/c was, well, less than able. It made a lot of noise, but gave out little cold air. But I would only realize this later in the day. And especially so at night.
We were starving by now and wanted to a) see the city and b) get some clothes. We had nothing to wear. Only the clothes we had on and which, by now, were very sweaty. Did I mention Rome was hot?
We left the hotel, which was, it seemed, used to situations such as ours. “You’ll get your bags tomorrow”, said the receptionist/owner, and off we went to eat and do some shopping.
We found a small restaurant about 3 minutes away and sat down. We ordered one pizza for the both of us and something to drink. It was the best pizza we would have during the whole trip. It was that good.
The service, however, was pretty bad. I wouldn’t say it went downhill from there, but rather that the service in Rome was consistently bad day in, day out.
Our waiters over the next few days, it would seem, would find new and creative ways in which to outdo their colleague’s ‘performance’ throughout our stay. And no, we hardly spent a penny on tips while in Rome.
So, after having lunch and stopping off at the local grocery shop where we got basic eating and drinking supplies, as well as some toiletries, it was back to the hotel, quick shower, and out before the stores closed.
Rome was baking under the sun, and us with it.
Out we went into the Corso Vittorio Emanuele II and started walking East, with no particular place to go. Also, we didn’t really know which way to go. We were torn between wanting to see the sights, and our clothing needs, so we tried to concentrate very little on what we saw, hard to do since if you’ve never been to Rome, everything is new to you, even when nine or ten centuries old. Or more.
Eventually, we got to Via del Corso, but not before we stumbled on the Piazza Venezia and the enormous marble and stone behemoth to our right: the monument to King Vittorio Emanuele II, first King of Italy.
This is one of the monuments on my list which I would not really arrive at the way I had expected. When I say we stumbled, I mean it. It is gigantic, but it is not exactly by a major road, it is on a major square, but off to the right, so if you happen to be on the street and not turn right, you might not exactly see it. But then, once you do, you can’t see anything else.
I wanted to go to it (yes, its array of classical columns was calling me) and bask in its classical ‘interpretative’ colossal beauty, but it was not to be on that first day.
We had no time, it was hot, and we needed clothes.
We turned into the Via del Corso, and forgot about it.
Via del Corso is one of those major shopping streets in central Rome. Many of the major brands, and others not so major, are there. Although Rome’s high class shopping strip is the Via Condotti, which is further down the Via del Corso, to the right.
On the corner, just as you go into Corso, there is the Doria-Pamphilj Palace.
Serene and decorated in a wedding cake style, I was immediately drawn to it.
But didn’t go, and would, unfortunately, not get to go during the trip.
And that pretty much sums up the entire trip. I didn’t get to see, go or do many things.
So back to the Via del Corso, and our shopping. We had nothing to wear the next day, and clothes were urgently needed. So we spent the best part of the afternoon traipsing from store to store, looking for garments, and missing out on Rome altogether.
On a side note, I must point out that, by now, my partner and I were wondering how the people of Italy reproduced since, it was very obvious, all the men in that country were gay.
But I digress…Clothes-wise, our main hope turned out to be H&M, but, once we got there, almost at the end of the Corso, we discovered, much to our dismay, that there was no Men’s section there.
Can you believe it?
We had walked the entire length of the Corso in the hope of finding a place which might have something -overpriced- but my size. Fat chance.
Since at that point we were only about two blocks from the Piazza del Popolo, we decided to go there.
I have to say that by now, I was ready to be impressed, or something, and impressed I was.
I had long wanted to see the twin churches of Santa Maria in Montesanto (1662-75) and Santa Maria dei Miracoli (built 1675-79). And there they were, in all their Baroque beauty. I think this is the one time Rome got interesting that day. I would say it made the whole thing worthwhile, but it isn’t true.The day had sucked all along from the minute our luggage went missing. But that moment, when we walked into that space, covered in fatigue and sweat, the city seemed beautiful, the tourists a mere nuisance, the heat (and it was around 8:30 PM) almost tolerable.
It was magic. Rome was magic.
We stopped at the obelisk in the middle of the Piazza, an original comission of Sety I (later erected by Rameses II) from Heliopolis which stands in the centre of the Piazza, inside a fountain, and is the second oldest and one of the tallest obelisks in Rome (some 24 m high, or 36 m including its plinth).
It was brought to Rome in 10 BC by order of Augustus and originally set up in the Circus Maximus.
Once there, a tourist girl asked her friend if she could drink from the fountain. My partner overheard her and told her that he’d read that you could drink from any fountain in Rome, unless it specifically said not to.
She was happy about this, and we spoke with her for a couple more minutes. Turns out she was from Spain, and was there on holiday with a couple more friends from school. She must have been in her very early 20s. And she was lovely.
It was starting to get dark, and we decided to get back to the hotel. We couldn’t decide between catching a bus, taking the subway, or walking. So we walked back along the dark and not too busy streets of, as it turns out, downtown Rome. Soon we were back at the hotel, where there were no news about our luggage.
The hotel’s concierge really couldn’t care less, so we went to our room, had a shower and went out to have dinner, not too sure about where to do this.
We decided to follow the incoming crowd down one of the streets, and ended up at the Campo dei Fiori. It was teeming with life: children playing, musicians, flower vendors, Indian or Pakistani salesmen of trinkets.
In short, Touristland right there in front of us. The only Italians being the waiters at the Campo’s many restaurants. So in we walked, and decided that the one on the right, on the other side of La Carbonara Restaurant, where we should have dined, just as you walked in, would do. Mistake. The food, although ok once we got it, did not surpass the bad service of a place which doubled as a drinks bar and dance club after 11PM.
We kept getting food meant for other tables, everything arrived at odd intervals, drinks had to be ordered more than twice. In short, a mess.
But given the day’s big story, it really paled in comparison. We didn’t mind much that the service was so bad. I think we were relieved it was over more than anything else!
Afterwards, we went for a walk on the Tiber, and saw that, at night, it really came alive. What a beautiful city this is.
It seems like the good citizens of Rome have allowed for bars and stands to be set up alongside the banks of the river. We were immediately drawn by the music and the bright, intermitent, lights of the marquees.
We crossed the bridge, and went down to the riverbank. We saw a couple of small stands which were a sort of Godsend since they had one of the items we needed most: a phone charger!
Yes, ours were safely (we hoped) stored inside our suitcases, and these, somewhere in Europe. We then decided to go to one of the “bars”. A rugby-themed bar by the side of the Tiber showing New Zealand’s Rugby matches.
Yes, slightly surreal, but then Rome is slightly surreal.
We would have stayed longer, but we were beat. We had had a long day and were yearning for sleep.
So after a couple of drinks, we headed back to the hotel. The room was not exactly cold, although the imitation a/c had been on all afternoon, so we agreed to sleep with the balcony window open. And the air con on. So our first day in Rome ended.

An Italian Summer — Part I
This is Part I of my travelogue An Italian Summer — starting with the eternal city of Rome.
Rome was not built in a day. No surprises — it took us four days to visit it and we were left wanting for more.
Rome is a veritable explosion of ancient history, art and culture. That also means it is thronged by enthusiastic tourists throughout the summer, and it is wise to plan in advance in order to avoid long queues and inconvenience.
The central location of our hotel — the Westin Excelsior — ensured we could reach most places of interest on foot, and get public transport for the others with ease. You will spend a lot of time outdoors in Rome, so choose location over amenities while picking a place of stay.
Let me walk you through our itinerary, answering some of the why’s and what’s alongwith.
We landed in Rome past noon-time on 3rd September and got ourselves a local SIM card and picked up our Roma Pass at the Airport.
There are a lot of posts on the internet debating whether the Roma pass is a good investment. Unless you are planning to vegetate at the Hotel, it is a no-brainer. It includes entry to the Colosseum & Forum, plus unlimited access to the public transport (Metro & Bus).
Get a cab from the Airport to the city centre, usually costs about €50–60. We freshened up at the Hotel, got ourselves a light lunch and started walking where our feet would take us.
The evening brought about an array of flavours. We ambled across the cobbled streets, got hold of every photo-op against pretty street cafes, saw miniature and life-size versions of wooden Pinocchios, and got our first lick of authentic Italian Gelato.
By the way, amidst all this, we also saw the Trevi fountain and climbed up the Spanish steps and saw a lovely sunset with a street musician singing Ed Sheeran in the background. The city of Rome is a gigantic museum — you just cannot stay away from history and architectural beauty.
We trooped back to the hotel early. Streets in Rome get rather desolate by about 9 pm, and roaming around on foot is not advisable.
The Roma pass includes priority access to the Colosseum (€18, otherwise). However, the authorities have placed a concurrent visitors restriction due to which one must also reserve a time slot at a cost of €2 per person here.
We had a slot for 12 noon so we had a relaxed start to the day. We had breakfast this day, and also the next 2 days, at this handy cafe called Xtra One Coffee at Via Lombardia. At our designated time, we entered the Colosseum through a priority channel, smirking at the long queues sweating it out for an entry. GET PRIORITY ENTRY EVERYWHERE YOU GO!
It is an awe-inspiring visual as one enters the colossal stadium. Though, thanks to repair work in arena area, there were steel scaffolds which ruined the authenticity of the surroundings. We plugged into Rick Steves’ audio tour as we entered and, while listening to its ‘bloody’ past, we roamed around its many tiers.
After a wholesome tour, we stepped out across the road to Ristoro Della Salute. And we were back in the queue for the Roman Forum by half past two. We spent a good half an hour waiting here (there’s no skipping this line). But it was well worth it.
Having read Julius Caesar as part of my ICSE syllabus, I was thrilled to be where it all transpired. The Via Sacra, Caesar’s grave, the Rostrum where Cicero and Antony spoke, the Vestal Virgins — it was like reading a book. and Rick Steves’ guide did complete justice to the experience, yet again.
Our next stop was the adjacent Palatine Hill (that’s where the word palace comes from) housing lush gardens and remnants of Rome’s glorious history. To be honest, if one intends to get into the details of the monuments scattered on this hill as well, it would be hard to do it the same day as the Colosseum and the Forum. The place shuts at 6pm, a fact that deprived us of a potentially lovely sunset from a vantage point situated inside.
After a long day, we headed to the nearby Gran Caffe Martini & Rossi to get an early dinner and some Sangria. What followed ranks among our top memories from the trip: a view of the Colosseum by night. That surreal picture summed up almost everything anyone asks for from Rome.
And that was Day 2.
This was our day of casual ‘walking around the city’ in between visits to the Colosseum and to the Vatican the day after. The idea was not to burn ourselves out in the first few days of the trip.
Rick Steves came to our rescue again. We picked up his walking guide “Heart of Rome” and headed out on the streets of Rome with our backpacks.
A bus ride from Bissolati to C.so Vittorio Emanuele, and we were at our first stop — Campo de’ Fiori, a lively market square with a dark history of public execution.
The colorful, busy market made for a great start. From here, we meandered through tourist laden streets, with historical nuggets strewn all around, to a centerpiece of Baroque art and architecture — Piazza Navona. The vast plaza is adorned with three majestic fountains including Bernini’s Fountain of Four Rivers, and Boromini’s imposing church facing them.
It was lunch time. While the piazza is lined with restaurants, we resisted the obvious options and walked into one of the adjacent lanes, and didn’t regret it one bit. As we walked the Via di Tor Milina, we bumped into merry accordion players, street bands playing with gusto and enthusiastic restaurant waiters offering us a ‘better’ deal. We chose a place closest to the music and downed some food with a serving of the much talked about Aperol Spritz.
With a fuller belly, we moved on to the iconic Pantheon, a monument preserved exceedingly well for its ~1900 year old history. Rick Steves has a dedicated audio tour of the Pantheon — you don’t need any guide thanks to that.
From here, Rick Steves was egging us to head to the familiar Trevi & Spanish steps area, so we looked beyond. Close to the Pantheon lies Largo di Torre Argentina, an important ruin and site of the murder of Julius Caesar — the senate was meeting across town on the day he was slain. Close to this was the Campidoglio — a hilltop square designed by Michelangelo with a statue of Marcus Aurelius on his horse marking the center and facades of conservatories marking its periphery. We spent some time visiting some of the relics housed in these buildings. These are covered under the Roma pass and could consume a good two hours if you are really into ancient relics.
Stepping out of the Campidoglio, we walked up the Altar of the Fatherland built in honor of Victor Emanuelle II in the early 20th century and boasting of an impressive facade. We could only spent about 20 minutes here since they evacuate tourists at 6pm.
Late evening took us back to the Spanish steps (a steep climb again!) and then to the Trevi fountain for a night time view which is highly recommended. We had an early start for the Vatican next day and we hadn’t really gotten rid of the jet lag, so this ended up to be another early night.
We had booked an escorted priority entrance to the Vatican on headout.com at 8am! While Vatican is accessible by train (Ottavio metro station), we took a cab and grabbed breakfast on the way. We made it in the nick of time only to be told that we were the only 2 people booked for the slot, and we could wait 30 minutes and join a full guided tour with 6–7 other folks, at no extra cost. w00t w00t!
Surely, the Gods had intervened. I have rarely ever gone for human guides, but the Vatican is a giant maze and it is highly recommended to book a full tour. It helped that our guide was knowledgeable and witty to match.
Keep a good 3–4 hours for a full tour of the Vatican, the Sistine Chapel and St. Peter’s Basilica (perhaps more if you want to climb up the Basilica’s steps to the dome). Even as you step out to the Vatican square, the plaza looks resplendent with fountains and an array of statues lining the surrounding buildings’ rooftops. Covering your knees and shoulders is advisable.
As we stepped out of the Vatican, we spotted a McDonald’s and that was lunch because, well, we needed a break from pizza & pasta. Already.
Before heading to Trastevere for our last evening in Rome, we did a detour to the Chiesa di Santa Maria della Vittoria which houses Bernini’s sculpture The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa — a statue you might remember from Dan Brown’s Angels & Demons. It is a church as grand as any other and an item checked off the bucket-list.
Trastevere is the trans-Tiber section of Rome. Due to its quaint and bohemian buildings and houses, Trastevere is pretty Instagram-friendly. There is an audio tour by Rick Steves on Trastevere as well, and we spent the first hour or so getting to know the history of the commune, walking the neighbourhood, and visiting the Church of Cecilia & that of Santa Maria.
It was Friday evening and weekend revelry was in the air. We passed a number of piazzas where locals had got together to enjoy some food, drinks and music. As the evening set in, we went back to Piazza Trilussa and saw an exhilarating band performance. Ponte Sisto — the bridge in front of the Piazza was also abuzz with street artists and beat boxers. It was a far cry from the vibe of central Rome, and it won’t be far-fetched to say that this was indeed the Heart of Rome.
We found a quieter alley for dinner at a fine restaurant called Latteria Trastevere. And with a long-ish goodbye walk, we boarded the tram from Trastevere to Venezia, where, to our surprise, there was a traffic stop due to a night marathon. So, we had to wait for half an hour under the Roman night-sky before taking a cab back to the hotel.
It was our last night there. We weren’t complaining.
Rome is a city that keeps giving. Every day spent, even visits to the same sites, at times, offered us a fresh perspective or a yet-unseen relic.
It is a modern capital city with its roots firmly planted in its past — be it the well-maintained ancient monuments, the social piazzas or the water pumps providing water to passersby — each one of them telling tales from a history as old as time itself.

January 4, 2022|Italy
As expected, very late last night, Boo and I got our test results back for the PCR tests we took late yesterday afternoon. Negative for COVID. So yay!
Except . . . when I went to wake up Boo this morning, she told me that during the night, she had a headache and sore throat. She had taken ibuprofen and the symptoms went away And she felt fine this morning.
So we went about our day as planned. We took a walking tour through Ancient Rome. We met the group near Trajan’s column then walked past ”the wedding cake,” the monument to the king who united Italy.
Our guide was OK. Informative but not that entertaining. On the upside, he didn’t sing, so that was a blessing.
The guide took us up the hill behind the wedding cake where we had a glorious view over the rooftops of Rome. We were there at the stroke of noon, so we could hear bells peal across the city.

I first visited Rome back in 2015, and it remains my favourite European city to this day.
Mainstream, I know. “What’s your favourite song, Wonderwall?”, I hear you ask.
Well, no (although I do love Oasis). Just hear me out.
I’m a firm believer that Rome’s reputation has suffered because it’s so popular. It’s as though people refuse to judge the city on its merit, so widespread is the knowledge of its undeniable appeal. Sometimes it’s important to take a step back, and to try and refresh one’s perspective.
I often struggle with cities. I don’t understand the appeal of London, living some 90 minutes away from it myself, and I’ve found the energy of big cities a little oppressive at various times in my life.
That wasn’t the case in Rome, though.
Down every street, and round every corner, there’s something to marvel at — some unwavering reminder of what our species has achieved, and how it has evolved.

The day out of Levanto was an early morning because of the train tickets we’d booked in Venice. We took a regional train to La Spieza, south of Cinque Terre and then a direct train to Rome. This train was different in that it had booths of 6 seats each. I asked Yuki if she felt like she was going to Hogwarts.
We arrived in Rome and had to walk 2km to the Airbnb apartment. We were surprised that a city steeped in such history would be covered in so much graffiti. It covers a lot of buildings, most train cars, all municipal work vehicles, and any spot like tunnels or under bridges that are easily accessible and discrete. At the same time, the cobblestone streets made it difficult to drag our suitcases and the narrow sidewalks littered with garbage were a constant obstacle course. For all the problems, it is perhaps surprising that the drivers almost always stop for you to cross the road if you step out in front of them. They don’t try to ignore you or speed behind you like in Canada. So at first we were hesitant to cross the road but soon became accustomed to finding a break in traffic and forcing the next car to slow down and stop for us.
We were pleasantly surprised that the Airbnb apartment was actually a one bedroom place and that we got our own room again.
Probably my favourite part of Rome is that there are ruins everywhere. We went out to see one attraction and on our way to finding a subway line we stumbled upon the Piazza di Porta Maggorie. There is a tram station beside the ruins of what use to be Rome’s old city wall where an aqueduct cuts through at 30m high and one of the gates to the city was a tomb to a slave that was freed and became wealthy as a baker.
Further on we walked beside the remains of an aqueduct, one of 11 that use to feed the 1 million inhabitants of ancient Rome. The aqueduct and city walls have openings which have roads going through them. Some of them are the original gates repurposed for roads but others are just large demolitions cut out of the wall.
Our attraction of the day was the Spanish Steps, located in the North East of the city. Photos made it look appealing but when we arrived around dinner time the square was packed with tourists and the stairs had become a de facto public bench. We walked up and read that the stairs were significant for connecting two parts of town at different elevations. Otherwise, there isn’t much to them and we were less impressed.
Surprisingly, we found a family run restaurant with an enthusiastic and very happy greeter and waiter. This fun meal would be an abnormally of our time in Rome where the restaurant was happy, joked around, and cared about the service and food that they served. For the remainder of our time in Rome, we would have difficulty finding good food and service.
Our day of sight seeing in Rome began later than expected but we took a tram and one of two subway lines to the Colosseum. There are hawkers everywhere trying to get you to join a tour group. They offered entrance in the next few minutes for 30 euros and said that the line was 2hr. In reality, the line was about half an hour and admission without any guide costs 11 Euro. It would seem, however, that tour groups would be the normal for all of Italy. Everywhere we went, we were mobbed by tourist groups, whether formed by a company or a sole person at the entrance. Some of the larger attractions also have self-guided audio tours and many people can be found standing awkwardly around the attraction holding half of a phone up to their ear.
Needless to say, Yuki and I didn’t use any guides. This meant that we didn’t actually learn anything while visiting the historic sites as there aren’t really any display boards. The only learning we did was by reading up on wikipedia after the fact.The tour groups looked slow and the tour guides seemed to drone on and on so it was nice to be able to go at our own pace and wander around instead of being stuck to a set path.
I wasn’t all that impressed by the Eiffel tower in Paris but the Colosseum was massively impressive. Stepping out of the metro station, the scale and size of the Colosseum is enormous. Even in ruin, it is wonderful in shape and form. From the outside, the form of the Colosseum is beautiful, with each successive arch and while deteriorated and broken, it is easy to image how much grandeur there would have been back in ancient Rome.
Entering the Colosseum was also spectacular. It is interesting to note that tickets to events at the Colosseum were free but seating was arranged by social standing with the wealthiest at the lower bowl and the poor, furthest at the top. Each of the arches at the base of the Coliseum was an entrance that lead directly to the intended seats. This eliminated cross contamination between social classes but also was incredibly efficient in moving people in and out of the stadium.
We walked around the lower bowl for photos and peered down into the galleries below the originally wood arena. The signboards said how there use to be mock naval battles but stopped after a renovation. it wasn’t clear if that renovation had to do with adding the basement or a perimeter wall. I cannot imagine how they would be able to flood the arena with a wood floor and not only support the weight of the water but also be waterproof at the same time.
After the Colosseum we had to wander around for a bit to find a place to eat, which was the normal Italian food, and then we sat outside the Basilica di San Pietro for a while because they close for lunch. Of note, there are some religious artifacts, including chains that held Saint Peter and a statue of Moses by Michelangelo. There were also some other tombs adored with skeletons which we found odd and the roof had a nice painting on it.
Then we walked back to the Coliseum to visit the adjacent Roman Forums. The ticket to the Colosseum includes the Roman Forums and Palatine Hill across the street. This is where the Roman government buildings were located and is nearby to a wealthy neighbourhood. What is most impressive about the forums is the height of some of the ruins, indicating that some buildings were huge.
The Forums are mostly ruins now but I was struct by how a much of it is brick. It seems that the romans built predominantly in brick and covered the structures in a concrete paste or marble. I’d known about the romans and concrete before but I didn’t realize that it was used as mortar between bricks and not contemporary concrete with aggregates and moulds. Only certain buildings, or parts of buildings, are constructed from stone.
By the end of the forums we were too tired to walk up Palatine Hill so we planned on coming back the next day because the tickets are valid for two consecutive days.
The next item on our list of places to visit was Trevi Fountain. We found a shop before the fountain where we bought postcards for 0.4 euro each. We thought this was pretty good because they can be as high as 1 and are usually 0.5 or above but we found another store later that had them for 0.3 euro. Oh well.
The fountain is probably the most photographed in Rome. It was also crowded and so it felt like a lot of the other attractions where we only had enough time to get in, take our photos, and get out. There didn’t seem to be any time to appreciate or enjoy each place, especially with the crowds.
From Trevi fountain we walked to the Pantheon, passing the Piazza Colonna, which is significant because the tall round marble Column of Marcus Aurelius recounts the conquest of the Emperor in relief carvings that spiral up to a statue at the top.
The Pantheon was as large as I’d expected it to be and enormously voluminous inside. Looking at the roof, we knew that the square recesses were to reduce the weight of the roof but we wondered instead why the roof couldn’t be thinner. Like the Colosseum and the Roman Forums, the exterior was all brick. Apparently it used to be faced in marble but over the centuries that was scavenged away.
After the Pantheon we walked to the Piazza Navonna which has another impressive, but smaller fountain. We took a peak inside the Saint Agnese but there was a Sunday service in progress and the space was surprisingly small, although ordinate.
We had our worst lunch lunch afterwards at a restaurant just outside the square. The service was terrible and the food wasn’t that great either. The worst part was that the waiter tried to take 5 euros tip from us and I had to yell at him to get all our money back. For hearing that Paris waiters were snobs, we didn’t have a problem there and found that Italy was generally much worse in the tourist areas but very good in the local parts.
We were going to take the bus back to Palatine Hill but we couldn’t find a place to buy tickets so we decided to cheap out and just walk back. Along the way we stopped at the Piazza Venezia and took photos of the Altare della Patria. This monument is a modern symbol to the city of Rome and has some newer statues.
There are a lot of steps to climb on the way up and the view from the top is okay, but not great. It’s possible to go to the top by elevator but it cost 7 euro and we didn’t think it was worthwhile. In some ways, this building gives an idea to the grandeur of ancient Rome and what it must have been like in the past.
At the edge of the Roman Forums we realized that we’d forgotten yesterday’s tickets so we weren’t able to get back in. Instead we walked around to the Circuit Maximus but I was disappointed to find a sloping field with barely any trace of a race course. The Circuit Maximus use to be the largest chariot race track in the Roman Empire and was also used for many ceremonies and parades. Today, it could be mistaken for an undeveloped site as there’s nothing but a walking path.
For dinner we tried to go to Sushi but it was a high class place with a long line up. Instead we went to a take-away shop but it took an hour for them to prepare it. Still, Yuki got her much desired sushi and we have a good dinner at home of the type of food we wanted to eat.
Yuki’s Dad wanted to visit the Vatican so we went there. It took us a long time to get through security because I picked the wrong line. There was a mass of people that split into four lines. The first two lines had a security checkpoint each but the second two lines funneled into a single checkpoint. We were in the second line and the people around us were quite aggressive to get to the front of each other.
Saint Peter’s Basilica, had been described to us as a lot of dead saints. Like all the other religious sites, it was highly decorated in gold paintings and large but wasn’t that interesting to us. Turns out, there are a lot of dead saints. We considered visiting the Sistine Chapel but it seemed far and likely to have a long line so we walked through the Basilica’s grotto and then went for lunch.
Everyone looked forward to lunch at McDonalds because it is a dependable staple to be the same everywhere in the world. At least, almost the same. The taste was slightly different but it was a welcome relief to all the plain food we’ve been having lately. We never thought that we would be so eager to eat at McDonalds for lunch.
The last place to visit in Rome was the Baths of Caracalla which we discovered was very close to the Circuit Maximus we visited the day before. We had to transfer between the two subway lines at the Rome train station so we also used that opportunity to buy tickets for Yuki’s parents to get to the airport as they would be going alone the next day. As with all things family related, it took a lot of explaining in three different languages to get the message through to her Dad who speaks English and Japanese and her mom who speaks Japanese and Thai. Yuki’s patience seem almost angelic for all the explaining and translating she has to do.
Frustratingly, the Baths closed early on Monday so we walked to them for nothing. Frances, who had visited Rome in August, recommended going to the Pyramide metro station and Eatalia, a department store of restaurants. It turned out to be a station beyond Pyramide so we had a tiresome walk and the building was actually more of an expensive health food store. There were three levels with restaurants but the main business was selling healthy foods and the restaurants looked posh. Dejected, we backtracked to a Ramen restaurant we’d passed walking there and ate a small early dinner because we were all still full on McDonalds for lunch.

The OUP blog has an excerpt from Bryan Ward-Perkin’s The Fall of Rome.
It is currently deeply unfashionable to state that anything like a ‘crisis’ or a ‘decline’ occurred at the end of the Roman empire, let alone that a ‘civilization’ collapsed and a ‘dark age’ ensued. The new orthodoxy is that the Roman world, in both East and West, was slowly, and essentially painlessly, ‘transformed’ into a medieval form. However, there is an insuperable problem with this new view: it does not fit the mass of archaeological evidence now available…
The Fall of Rome is one of these things that varies from whatever perspective you take. I remember my Roman lecturer on my BA commenting that many historians felt Rome went into terminal decline during the third century. Over two hundred years, he dryly noted, must have been some decline. The British Empire has collapsed in the last century, are we walking in the ruins of a one mighty empire?
Yet Ward-Perkins is right. There is a change. Pottery becomes pretty cruddy stuff. Writing becomes much much rarer. Civic centres fall. If civilisation is living in cities, then there is definitely a collapse of civilisation. While it might not be visible over the course of a lifetime, it is there. It depends what questions you ask of the data. The grand durée of history doesn’t disappear simply because the individual becomes the fashionable thing to study in the Thatcherite era.
I remember being taught that Saxons didn’t really invade, they came over as farmers. The Vikings didn’t invade either, they were peaceful farmers with a bad press. It makes you wonder how and why a lot of weapons came to be invented with all these peaceful farmers going everywhere. Perhaps an understanding of barbarians might remind us why civilisation might be a good idea.

To celebrate my 50th birthday, my best friend and I embarked on our first European adventure, with Rome as our initial destination. Upon our arrival, we were immediately struck by the city’s incredible scale and beauty. “Everything is so grand!” became our catchphrase — and it truly was. Down every street and around every corner, something extraordinary awaited. In the open-air museum that is Rome, forget the car, put on your walking shoes, and get ready to log 15,000 steps/day discovering the city’s landmarks and hidden treasures.
Before experiencing Rome in person, we’d spent months laying out our itinerary, starting with a Google map where we pinpointed the places we wanted to visit and marked the center with a figurative X. When we arrived in Italy, what had appeared on the map as a web of gray lines connecting landmarks was transformed into living, breathing Roman arteries bursting with vibrant culture and sensory delights. Serendipitously, the focal point marked by an X landed us in the heart of Rome at the Palazzo Navona Hotel, situated next to the Piazza Navona. It proved to be the perfect launching point for our three-day exploration of the Eternal City.

I took a three-day trip to Italy on New Years. It was always my dream to visit the great Ancient Rome, so you can imagine how excited I was for this trip. Throughout my visit, I experienced some wonderful places, great food, and met new people. I want to share with you the rookie mistakes that I made, the things I did right, and ultimately what I learned from this experience. Here are some tips for navigating your way through the beautiful city of Rome.
Pack well (and right!!): Extra clothes, check, portable charger, check, type C, F, and L power outlet plugs, not check. Seriously, I spent the first half of my day there looking for electronic stores with the correct power outlet adapters. I made a rookie mistake, and hopefully, you will not have to.
Don’t pay extra. If anyone tries to convince you that you have to pay to get into the Vatican, I will assure you that you don’t. As soon as I arrived at the Vatican, I was unpleasantly approached by a man who apparently had only two tickets left to sell for the Vatican. Most might think that they “got lucky” and that they had just made it there in time before tickets were sold out, but that isn’t the case at all. Just keep your head up and walk right into the Vatican. It’s free. Thankfully, binge-watching travel videos on youtube helped me with that one.
Take lots of pictures. If you are traveling along, you can even ask tourists to take photos of you! As a solo traveler, I had plenty of time to soak in all the views and take my time appreciating all the sights and wonders. It is nice to take some pictures so you can reminisce later (who knows when you’ll be back). If you want to take some pictures of yourself, ask tourists if they’d be willing to take it for you, you’d be surprised how much photography talent there is in the crowd. If you see someone who could use a hand, offer to help them take their picture, they might offer to take yours back. Well, hey, it worked for me.
Plan well! I packed my day with wonderful sightseeing adventures and activities. It is crucial to check openings of the different places, especially on holidays. Unfortunately, I missed out on the great opportunity of seeing the Sistine Chapel because it was closed on the new year.
Throw a coin (or two) into the Trevi Garden. Legend has it that if you throw a coin over your head into the Trevi Fountain, chances are, you will return to Rome. If you throw two, you will return to Rome and fall in love, and three, you will return to Rome, fall in love, and get married there. I don’t know if this has been proven correct, but it can’t hurt to take your chances either way. Unluckily, I didn’t get to throw coins into the fountain, but have no doubt; I shall return.
Check out what Italy is known for, then make sure not to miss out. I enjoyed some delicious Italian Ice Cream, Pizza, and House Wine. The wine is incredibly affordable in Italy. While in the restaurant, don’t rush to receive the bill. It is customary in Italy to stick around and have a conversation after a nice meal.
Fly Ryanair! This one is a little bit controversial. If you asked me then if I would fly Ryanair again, I would have said that I would absolutely not. Looking back though, I realize how convenient it was to have a cheap flight from London to Rome. Just make sure you read exactly what you need to do when buying the ticket so they won’t charge you extra for late check-in or carry-on bags. If you don’t want to experience flight delays though, don’t fly with Ryanair. They might have cheaper flights, but that doesn’t mean they come without a cost.
I hope asome of these travelling tips helped you out! I know that I need to take some of my own advice on my next trip to Rome.
Edit: This blog is a repost from 3 years ago when I first visited Rome. Hope you enjoy!

Playing as Carthage in Total War: Rome 2 using the DEI mod.,https://medium.com/@thomas-dee/playing-as-carthage-in-total-war-rome-2-using-the-dei-mod-15100fb54253,"Sign up

For those unfamiliar with the Total war franchise it is essentially the dream game for military-history nerds like myself. It allows you to play as various different factions during a set time period- whatever era that game has chosen to focus on. Your aim as that faction is to conquer the map and build your empire. Unlike other history strategy games like EU4 or the Civ games, you can fight battles in real time on campaign maps. This is really what set total war apart and is why I fell in love with the games at a young age.
Of the various different time-periods Creative Assembly (the UK-based game developer) has done over the years the Ancient-Roman/Greek games have always been of particular interest to me. The idea of testudos, phalanxes and war elephants appealed to me in a way that things that came before such as Stone/Bronze Age warfare and periods that came after like the Medieval era could never fully equate to.
Needing to relax in my free time, as I am currently preparing for my COMPTIA Security + exam, I decided to play Rome Total War 2. However, the vanilla version of the game is a bit too normal and to spice things up you really have to be playing the DEI mod. If you were to sum up the DEI mod in one word it would be immersion. Multitudes of carefully researched new units, game mechanics and options have been added to the game.
All I needed to do now was pick a faction. Having recently done a Roman run and given that I’ve been reading and watching videos on the Punic war I wanted to give the Carthaginian Empire a good go. My aim would be to do what Hanno, Hannibal and Hasdrubal couldn’t. Conquer Italy.
Like in real life, in 272 BC Carthage has a tricky start. As a maritime focused, trading empire, stretched across the western Mediterranean, you find yourself facing threats from multiple directions. Your Spanish holdings are open to attack from savage tribes across the Iberian Peninsula, desert tribes to your south are ready to strike when they sense you are at your weakest and your holdings on the Island of Sicily are also under threat from the Greek city-state of Syracuse. And this is of course all before you come to the main emerging threat to your empire…the Romans!!!
No mean feat to be able to deal with such an array of threats. But wait there’s more. To make matters worse and in-accordance with historical accuracy, your land forces leave a lot to be desired. Carthage, as is the way with many trading empires, relied heavily upon their wealth to get mercenaries to fight their battles for them and only had a small core of their citizens as soldiers. The mercenary-centric nature of your armies could not be more strongly contrasted with the state-funded and citizen-staffed legions of Rome. Yet, there are some slightly redeeming features such as having superb cavalry, like Numidian and Iberian horsemen, and an array of aggressive light infantry mercenaries, which you can get from Gaul and Iberia. Whereas Rome goes for standardisation, to play to your strengths you should rely on the variety of mercenaries you can choose from.
With this all in mind, I devised a clear strategy. I would focus, as Carthage did in real life following their defeats in the 1st Punic War, on expanding my already existing Spanish holdings. I wanted to be able farm their resources and set up mines in order to fill my coffers for my future war against Rome. In essence it was a race against time- could I add Spain to my Empire before Rome came south and attacked me? In order to fulfil this strategy, I would have to leave other fronts less defended and accepted that some territorial losses like in Sicily or Africa would occur as a consequence of focusing on Spain.
Things kicked off to a terrible start. Whilst recruiting armies in Nova Carthago (SE Spain) to begin my bloody conquest of the Iberian Peninusla, Syrcause decided to launch a surpise attack on my Sicilian cities. They swiftly took my cities and liberated them to a Greek vassal of theirs. This was all part of the plan… I expected this to happen I reassured myself.
All was not lost, however, for two reasons. Firstly, through the use of trade and diplomacy I was able to prevent the desert tribes from attacking me to the south and I had secured my eastern border by establishing friendly relations with the Ptolemies in Egypt. Also by implementing a policy of Divide et Impera (see what I did there) I was now picking off one Spanish tribe at a time. Even better Rome had become mired in an attritional war against Epirus and then subsequently wars against raiding Thracian and Illyrian tribes. Again all I needed was time, even if they won those wars I would be strong enough to handle Rome on my own…if I conquered Iberia.
However, whilst I was getting closer to completing this goal, with my various armies subduing and annexing one tribe after another- disaster struck again. One of the Carthaginian noble houses revolted against my rule (the Barcid Family) and launched a revolt in my western African possessions . This threatened to stall my Spanish foray grievously. Luckily through the extra funds I was now receiving, I raised extra armies to speed up my conquest of Spain and through the use of my Numidian vassals I was able to simultaneously conquer Iberia and stave off the threat from the fifth column.
I was therefore ready to invade Sicily and take back what had once been Carthaginian. The invasion was swift and decisive. The Greek field armies, weakened by their own failed invasions, were swept aside by my invasion force. The siege of Syracuse was tough and bloody and after a desperate sally attempt by the defending forces; the city eventually fell.
Rome, seeing that I had taken all of Sicily for myself, declared open war against me. I knew I had to act fast, raising another army in Carthage and bringing my last army in Spain over to Sicily I was ready to invade Italy proper itself. My forces were able to overcome the two Roman legions defending their southern most province, Consentia.
Following this, Rome attempted to field 3 legions against my main force, however with fresh reinforcements coming in from Carthage and Iberia, I was now able to threaten multiple cities on the Italian mainland. After a great battle near Beneventum, I had crushed the last significant Roman force on the Italian Peninsula. It was a brutal engagement, which was won by my Iberian cavalry delivering a rear charge to their infantry and shattering their centre. After I secured my foothold in Magna Graecia, I finally marched on Rome. Following a direct assault on their city walls, the garrison of Rome was overcome and the city fell into Carthaginian hands. Rome was a broken power all that was left was to mop up the remaining strongholds it held on Italy.
So what are my reflections on playing as Carthage? Tough to be sure, particularly with the mod I was using. Fun?- Definitely, the initial position Carthage finds itself in requires planning and strategic foresight from the player. Although there were certain things the game cannot accurately represent and a couple of things which were a bit unrealistic, playing as Carthage is certainly something I would recommend to any person considering checking out the DEI mod. It is probably not as fun as Rome, the mod is built around playing as Rome, but as my Carthaginian campaign shows, you can still have a whole lot of fun roleplaying an alt-historical scenario such as winning as Carthage during the Punic Wars. These what-if scenarios have always fascinated us amateur military historians because we get to relive the strategic decisions that generals went through and it is exciting in itself to see how a different military strategy could have enabled a losing side to win and changed the course of history.

The professor showed us a photo of an insect.
“What is that?” he asked us.
A cricket.
“What would you think if you saw it on your bed?”
Get it off my bed.
But would I think the same way if I grew up in another part of the world?
Crickets.
Stepping on a plane to Rome, I did not expect that a metaphorical cricket would be one of the most important things I took with me on the plane back. But, here we are.
I recently spent two weeks in Rome, Italy, taking an international business class through Marquette University’s summer study abroad program.
We spent much of our time learning about how to do business in a global market and how to understand cultural differences. We also toured businesses in Rome and saw how global companies operate. We spent time exploring Rome and of course, eating a lot of gelato.
I had never been abroad. I had never even taken a business class. But this program expanded my view of both in new ways.
They say when in Rome, do as the Romans do. When I was in Rome, I saw firsthand how we all do as our culture tells us to do. But I also learned how to bridge those divides.
I have taken international advertising and public relations classes so I had some knowledge about global business before I went. I knew about high context and low context cultures. I knew about the importance of a power index to some cultures. I thought I understood it — but being abroad changed my perception on culture.
We are all told to live by the golden rule: treat others as you want to be treated. This doesn’t apply in other cultures. Here’s why.
Professor Kevin MacGabhann from the Strasbourg Business School in France was the professor who pulled up a photo of a cricket. He eventually explained.
In America, we see crickets as pests.
In Thailand, crickets are a popular snack.
In China, crickets are pets.
We might find customs strange if we’re not used to them. But once we learn more, we can understand it.
Most people understand that cultures build bonds and also create differences among groups of people. We can then begin to understand those differences as we learn more.
Professor MacGabhann showed us that understanding is only the first step. We need to recognize these differences in ourselves. We might find it abnormal that people eat crickets, but they might find it abnormal that we kill them.
Cultural differences are two-sided; we need to recognize the differences in both directions.
After we recognize our own cultural differences, we can begin to adapt. This is the most crucial step. Treat others as they want to be treated.
Treat others as THEY want to be treated.
When we are among different cultures, we need to adapt to their culture. Without doing that, we will run into tension and problems. That does not mean we need to go out and buy a cricket to keep in our room or eat one with dinner. It means if we are in Thailand, China, or somewhere else, we shouldn’t step on a cricket.
And maybe you are already adapting — you can get a cricket lollipop in Waukesha or a grasshopper taco at Belair Cantina not too far from campus.
In the context I learned them, these points were geared toward international business relations. However, they do not stop there.
I think that this point is so important no matter where we are. There are different cultures within schools, neighborhoods, work environments. We need to understand, recognize, and adapt whether we are in the Marquette bubble or across the world in Rome.
We need to understand, recognize, and adapt whether we are in the Marquette bubble or across the world in Rome.
I know that now I am going to look at my everyday life differently. I will pay more attention to the cultures surrounding me and do my best to learn and adapt.
I want to travel abroad again. I want to find new cultures and learn about them and try to adapt to them. But I do not have to go far to do that. I will start where I am and hopefully that will lead me across borders again.
Because abroad or not, I want to remember to do as the Romans do. Treat them how they want to be treated.

The Vestal Virgins inhabited a unique space in Roman society. They were the most prominent women in Rome, heavily revered and with privileges no other woman was given. But they also lived with extreme duties and restrictions. Their most famous restriction is obvious from their title: every Vestal was unmarried and pledged to remain a virgin through her thirty-year term of service. And a Vestal who broke her oath of chastity was buried alive.
But how often was this extreme measure used? And when it was, what did it look like? I have been researching Vestals for a few years as I work on a historical fiction novel centered around one (coming soon, I hope), and I’ve had to get into the nitty gritty details. Here’s what we know about the ultimate punishment for Rome’s most sacred virgins.
Before we bury one alive, let’s make sure we know who the Vestals were.
People ignore Vesta, but she’s one of my favorite goddesses, and was one of the Romans’ favorites too. Her duty doesn’t sound like a big deal today — goddess of the hearth, the fireplace. Modern people tend to think, “why have a goddess for that?” But for the ancients, the fireplace wasn’t just something to get cozy by to drink hot chocolate. It was the source of fire for the house, meaning the light for their lamps and the heat that cooked their food. Without Vesta’s flame, a house was vulnerable and unlivable. Vesta made a house into a home.
Sure Vesta isn’t as splashy as some other deities — she’s a virgin goddess so she doesn’t have relationship drama, and she’s a guardian of the home so she doesn’t leave to have adventures. But to the ancients she was steadfast and ever-present, a goddess without whom life would have been impossible.
Vesta’s private role as protector and life giver to the household was reflected in her public worship. There was a shrine to Vesta in the Forum Romanum¹ tended by the Vestal Virgins, who kept her sacred flame burning. Just as a house must have a hearth to make it a home, Rome was not Rome if the eternal flame was not burning — the flame represented the safety of Rome, and the favor of the gods that allowed Rome to hold its vast conquered empire. It took 24-hour maintenance to keep the sacred flame from going out. The Vestals also prepared the sacred grain/salt mixture that was sprinkled on the head of every sacrificial animal, so in a real way, Roman religion would have been nothing without them.
This legal status of the Vestals was unlike any other woman’s in Rome. For the ancient Romans, one of the essential characteristics of a woman was male control: she belonged to either her father or her husband. Widows with no living father had to pass into the legal control of a living male relative.² Unfortunately, the notion of women belonging to men is not strange to us. But male control of women was much more deeply entrenched in the Roman legal code than it ever has been in ours, and freeing the Vestals from that control put them into a shadow category, a zone that was neither masculine nor feminine. They could make wills and testify in court, which other women could not because they weren’t considered autonomous. They were also sacrosanct — it was illegal for men to touch them — and bizarrely sacred — if a Vestal accidentally met a man on his way to execution, his life would be spared.
After their thirty years were up, Vestals could do as they wished. Many chose to marry (and apparently men really loved marrying former Vestals, which seems like a lot we could unpack but I’m choosing not to). But many chose to continue their legal limbo — if she married, the former Vestal rejoined Roman society as a wife, reentered male control in the household of her new husband. An unmarried former Vestal was still a woman apart, the only truly autonomous woman in ancient Rome.
In short, Vestals were separate from Roman society, even as they lived in the middle of it. They were separated legally, and they were separated from close contact. They were not Romans really, but something else… they were representatives of all Romans, and of Rome itself.

But I promised I’d tell you what happened when a Vestal Virgin was convicted of violating her oath of chastity. For a Vestal, having sex was a betrayal of her promise to Vesta, an act which would put the safety of Rome in jeopardy. The virginity of average Roman girls and women was controlled in similar (though not identical) ways as in many societies today, but that’s not really what was going on with the Vestals. A Vestal’s purity was supposed to be a requirement for the proper public worship of Vesta, and Vesta’s worship guaranteed the safety of Rome. So an “improper” Vestal would lead to a loss of favor with Vesta for all of Rome — big trouble.
The accusation of inchastity could come in a few forms. It might come from a man — from someone who had heard of an affair, or maybe (though less likely for reasons that will soon be obvious) from the man who’d had sex with her himself, in a moment of repentance.
But, since a Vestal having sex was supposed to be an affront to the gods, the accusation might also come in the form of prodigies. Prodigies were messages from the gods in the form of unexplainable and supernatural events — calves born with two heads, lightning striking prominent monuments, etc. Two examples that stick in my mind are a soldier’s shield falling from the sky and a fully intact human head being found in the ground when digging a foundation. Prodigies sent the Romans to their priests, who would interpret the message and tell the citizens what action the gods required from them.
Some prodigies were good, but many (perhaps even most) threatened doom unless the gods were appeased. And sometimes the omens pointed a finger at the Vestal Virgins, and one or more of them would be accused of violating their oaths without any earthly evidence.
After the accusation, a trial. This was not the same as the trial of a citizen: it was a religious trial with the Pontifex Maximus as judge and the Pontifical College as jury.³ The priests would vote to convict or acquit. If they convicted her, the Vestal would be executed.
The doomed Vestal was carried, gagged, through the streets in a litter that had its coverings fastened down with cords; she could be neither seen nor heard. Crowds followed the litter, but it was apparently a solemn and silent occasion. She was brought to a tomb buried under a ridge of earth near the Colline Gate, on the north side of the city. Paradoxically, the tomb of disgraced Vestals was the only tomb allowed to be inside the city walls.
The tomb was stocked with provisions: bread, water, milk, oil, a lamp, and a bed, as if the Vestal was expected to go on living inside. Her litter was unbound and she was led, heavily veiled, to the steps to her tomb. Then the Pontifex Maximus said a prayer, and all the pontifices would avert their eyes as the Vestal went down, to avoid witnessing the moment of shame.
The tomb was buried, and the Vestal was left to die down there, no grave marker to commemorate her improper death.
The Vestal’s lover would then be subjected to a public flogging. Whipping was a common punishment — the pain was part of the point, but it was more about the public shaming. These floggings could leave the man alive, or they could be carried to the point of his death. Or, if her lover saw all this coming, he might just flee into self-imposed exile.
It was common for upper-class men in Rome to escape into exile if they knew they were about to receive a punishment that would either a) permanently mar their reputation or b) kill them. Rome tolerated this sort of thing and made no effort to hunt down the fugitives — a man who saw a trial turning against him would often leave town at night and face no consequence other than his loss of status. In the eyes of the ancient nobility, that loss of status was punishment enough… but when you put it on a scale next to “buried alive,” yeah, not so much. It was very possible for a man to escape with his life if he were accused of sleeping with a Vestal, and very difficult for the Vestal herself to do the same.

The live burial of a Vestal was, importantly, bloodless. The Romans didn’t kill the Vestal — they put her in a room with the essentials of life to sustain her, and she died without their intervention. (Yes, I am aware they buried her in there; this is ritual, not logic.) It also offered the convenient out that the goddess could, if she so chose, save her priestess and prove her innocence. (I’m not sure if this was something the ancient Romans thought or just a modern supposition.)
The burial can also be meaningfully thought of as a human sacrifice. The gods were upset, and the Romans were offering up one of their holiest priestesses to soothe them. Human sacrifice was unthinkable to the Romans of classical times, but many of their religious rituals had much older roots in prehistory. Meanings got twisted and lost. The Vestal Virgin might originally have been a scapegoat, which would explain why she was kept so carefully between categories: she was no one’s wife and no one’s daughter, so she had no family to demand retribution for her death.
This quality of being outside categorization, and thus available as a sacrifice, might also explain why the Vestals had to be virgins in the first place. In a society in which a woman’s identity was totally dependent on her relationships with men, the sacred virgin stood apart. When they worshipped Vesta, the Vestals acted for the entire city: they could not represent the daughters, wives, or mothers of Rome (as other priestesses did); they had to be blank slates, to represent all Rome. Virginity meant lack of connections.
In short, a properly chaste Vestal was Rome itself. For the Romans, her purity was the safety of Rome, and when she lost it — when she slipped out of her symbolic role and back into worldly society by coming under the sexual “control” of a man — she had to forfeit her life as a sort of sacrifice to appease the gods. This she did in a method devoid of the kind of violence that would have sullied her further.
The immurement of a Vestal was a very rare occurrence. We only know of a few instances in all of Roman history.
Most of the Vestals who went on trial in the historical record were acquitted, not executed. In early history, we get the story of two Vestals who miraculously saved themselves from accusations of wrongdoing. When Vesta’s flame went out (usually interpreted as a sign of Vestal wrongdoing), the Vestal Aemilia threw her sash on it and it miraculously roared back to life, saving her. And a Vestal named Tuccia in the 3rd century BCE cleared her name by carrying water across the city in a sieve without spilling a drop. Vestals, as holy women, were supposed to be able to work miracles. Continuing to work miracles proved the continuing favor of Vesta, meaning they must still be virgins. (How or if these magic tricks fit into the formalized trial structure, I’ll never know.)
In 114 BCE came a bizarre prodigy: the young daughter of a prominent Equestrian was struck by lightning while riding her horse, and was found dead with her tongue sticking out and her dress hiked to her waist. Officials interpreted this as a sign of a scandal between an Equestrian and a Vestal Virgin. (Obvious, right?)
Three Vestals were accused: they said that Aemilia (not to be confused with the earlier miracle-worker) had become corrupt herself and then led the other two, Marcia and Licinia, into vice with her. Aemilia was convicted by the Pontifical College and executed, but the other two were acquitted.
What followed was outrage. The Roman people were convinced that there was a conspiracy of priests covering up the widespread corruption of the Vestal Virgins, and that the other two Vestals were also guilty. So in 113, a Tribune held another trial for the other two Vestals, moving it out of the Pontifical College and into the traditional court system. This trial resulted in a guilty verdict, and Marcia and Licinia were also executed.⁴
Emperor Domitian executed four Vestal Virgins starting in 87 CE. This was part of a push toward cracking down on public morality: like many reformers before and after, Domitian believed that people’s morals weren’t what they used to be, and that he could bring back the good old ways by punishing people for acting wrong. (Yeesh.) Domitian was also notoriously hostile toward the senate,⁵ and since the Vestals were the daughters of senatorial houses, killing them was a way to show the nobility who was boss. Since the emperor was always Pontifex Maximus, Domitian ran the trials and had no trouble securing convictions.
The first three convicted Vestals were actually not buried alive. Domitian allowed them to choose their method of execution. Only for the last, the Chief Vestal Cornelia in 91, did he insist on the ancient punishment. Which makes for an interesting point: we don’t know if the Vestal executions I described earlier were by burial. As far as I can tell, Cornelia is the only verifiable instance we have of a Vestal being buried alive. We know that the Romans considered this the ancient, traditional punishment, but we don’t know of anyone else it happened to.
Cornelia used the big public spectacle of her immurement as a platform. She announced to the crowd before the descended the steps: “Caesar thinks me unchaste, me who performed the sacraments under which he won, he triumphed?” Because, of course, a successful Domitian meant the favor of Vesta; if the empire was doing well, then surely that meant Cornelia was actually innocent.
On her way down, Cornelia stumbled, and the soldier accompanying her put out a hand automatically to help her. But Cornelia kept her balance without him and shied away from his touch — a sign to those watching (according to Pliny the Younger who recorded the incident) that this Vestal was so chaste she would not even accept the sacrilege of a man’s touch on the way to her execution.
And that’s about it for historical examples. There are vague insinuations of other Vestal executions, and concrete details of many other trials that resulted in acquittals, but we only have that handful of confirmed Vestal deaths, only one of them definitely by live burial. So though this sensational and very public punishment cast a long shadow over the lives of thousands upon thousands of Vestals who would never experience it, actual instances were vanishingly rare.
Which leaves us with two possibilities:
I’m inclined toward option 1 — probably there were instances of option 2, but the Rome I know was sincere enough in its religious beliefs that I have a hard time believing they were all openly flaunting tradition but not writing about it. I also think that the Roman men who wrote the histories had a hard time believing in a group of women who are uninterested in sex, and felt it necessary to imply that there had to be something going on there (when really, the something was worshipping Vesta). But historically, of course, it’s unknowable.
The Vestals were women who lived outside Roman society even in its very heart. From them we can learn much about Roman religion and Roman womanhood — and we can glimpse the sinister reasons for the policing of their virginities. The Romans held the Vestals up high when they were shining examples of Rome’s piety, and struck them down as low as they could when they became evidence of Rome’s corruption. The Vestal Virgins may have been the six most important women in all of Rome.
¹We usually call it the Temple of Vesta, but a Roman temple had to be planned out by augury (which Vesta’s wasn’t) and traditionally contained a statue of the deity (which Vesta’s didn’t). It was also rather small.
²In actual practice, such widows were usually fairly independent. But the fact remains that there was a legal requirement that they be in a man’s control.
³The Vestals were part of the Pontifical College, so the Vestals who had not been accused would have voted on the guilt or innocence of their colleague. Roman juries did not have the same ideas around impartiality as ours — in fact, it was considered an advantage if members of the jury to know the accused well, since their opinion of their character had weight in the case!
⁴This was a big move, the imposition of the civil government into what was supposed to be a religious matter. The boundaries between state and religion were a lot more porous than they (ideally) are today, but still — it was an insult to the priests, whom the politicians accused of not being able to handle their duties.
⁵There’s a probably-untrue anecdote in Cassius Dio in which Domitian invited senators to dinner and had gravestones for each of them made to put in their seats.

January 2, 2022|Italy
Today was a quiet day. We said goodbye to granny’s apartment in Assisi and boarded the train to Rome, our final stop in Italy.
The train trip from Assisi to Rome is not nearly as picturesque as the trip from Florence to Assisi. Fewer vineyards, fewer olive groves, fewer castles, no snow-capped peaks in the distance. We did see a few notable sites, however. In particular, we passed by Trevi (the town, not the fountain) which is one of those classic medieval towns where the church is on the peak of a hill and the rest of the town seems to tumble down the hillside.
We also passed by some random towers and fortifications that don’t seem to be guarding anything more interesting than a parking lot and a smattering of houses these days.
As we approached Rome, the surroundings, unsurprisingly, got more industrial and grittier. We passed by nondescript apartment blocks and graffiti that could have been in almost any city in the world.
We arrived a Termini station and seemed to walk for a mile to get to the exit. Then we hopped into a cab which proceeded to gouge us unconscionably. I’m too irritated to go into detail but it…

TLDR; I describe only this first stop of a recent 2-week trip to Italy — partly because of the initial strong and quintessential impressions I formed in this my first-time trip to Italy, and partly because the other dozen or so cities I visited which the reader can probably guess mostly echoed and nuanced these impressions.
Disclaimer: this is not meant to be fully representative of what you should expect when travelling in Rome. In fact it is probably a quite biased series of observations privy to my own meanderings, but I must say these feel very genuine and idiosyncratic of the city. All photos are unedited originals, and no AI was employed in the writing of this article. So Italians, feel free to bawl me out in the comments!
I am not an untraveled citizen of the world — — I’ve lived and toured all over Russia and China for years, for example — yet there are hundreds of countries I’ve never been to. Italy, for example! I realize this may be the exception to the rule for most Americans who can afford to cross oceans for travel, as Europe is a ready destination, whether to enjoy a summer out of school or participate in an exchange program because the cultural and linguistic barriers are lower than for Asia or Africa, for example.
Yet, I did not take preparation for this trip lightly. As I had done in my previous travels, I prepared as much as I could for the language, as I feel it is best to try to speak the local tongue not only out of respect for the people but also to enrich your own experience. Before traveling to Russia and China, for example, I had become fluent in those languages by my tried and true method. But for those I had a few years to spend, whereas this time I had just a few weeks. After skimming a long treatise on Italian grammar, I decided it was hopeless to memorize all the rules. I figured I would be best served in this time frame getting the gist of pronunciation and some basic phrases: what seemed to work well was opening up Google Street View to random locations in Italy, trying to guess the meaning of any signs or writing (graffiti included!) and speaking into Google Translate to check my pronunciation. Sometimes I was way off, but this made it fun! I also got some ‘street smarts’ of what to expect in random city locations. (Later on I had fun actually doing this live when traveling through city streets:
)
More formally, I transcribed Youtube videos (with captions to check my work) to polish listening comprehension. This is so much better than the old days of transcribing radio, and there’s a semi-infinite supply of great captioned videos out there. It’s nice that the graph shows, umm, statistically detectable progress over time!
I was still, however, pathetically prepared for the language. Luckily it is a Romance Language and thus not too far from English and Spanish, of which I know a little, so I could in principle struggle by. BUT, most importantly, essentially everyone we met in Rome spoke English! And when English didn’t pass the bar, they spoke Chinese! No joke, there is a sizable Chinese population in Rome running hotels, restaurants, taxis, and small shops, and I could converse with them absolutely fine!
Now the reader can imagine the usual hassle of international travel culminating in a teleportation to another reality outside the Fiumicino Airport. It looked not too dissimilar from JFK, to be honest. A Chinese driver picked us up, and we grilled him on all the ins and outs of living in Italy what with driving, shopping, eating, avoiding pick-pockets, etc. (he in fact spoke absolutely no Italian despite living there 14 years … that just shows you how strong the Chinese community is there!).
And I now transition to a series of disconnected, but in my view very profound, observations during my travel in Rome. What you will not see is any canned, touristy photos of say, the Colosseum.
Ah well, you’ll forgive me that one.
Every city has history, but in Rome it stares you in the face at every street corner. I mean, you’re walking along the street minding your own business and then the Pantheon is just there in front of you!
And plenty of modern shops and restaurants surrounding it from which to enjoy the view! (NB: these are usually not the better, more authentic restaurants).
Now this one really gets me, I mean is it just improbable or does this kind of thing happen every day: I’m walking through the park next to the Roman Forum, in the baking sun with my sandals feeling very historic and all, on a wide, dusty dirt path that must be trodden daily by thousands of tourists, and look down to pick up a dirty penny. I’m joking to myself, naw, could it be? Rubbing off the dirt, it is indeed no ordinary penny: it looks ancient! Well after some Google Image search it looks quite possibly to be not thousands of years old, but at least 200–300 years (a Vatican copper Quattrino from 1745?). Could also be a forgery to dupe stupid tourists like me, but I’ve been shown plenty of forgeries in my travels and they generally look good, with letters clearly visible and such, whereas this one looks a little too worn and bent by thousands of people stepping on it to make the trick worth it (probably about $10 by my reckoning based on eBay offers for ones in much better condition). Not a treasure exactly, and in its current foot-abused state of negligible archeological value (else I would have, ahem, turned it in to the authorities) but to grasp history serendipitously, and why me? Why now? This just made my day!
There’s no way I can do justice to the sheer volume of Classical Art in Rome, so I won’t even try. The Capitoline Museum, Borghese, countless cathedrals, … you will be overwhelmed by it, eyes and soul beaten to pure submission so you can barely issue a yelp of protest at the beauty in which you’re drowning. I will only say that on my first day in Rome I waited 2 hours in line to get into the Vatican Museum, and I have absolutely no regrets. Seeing this was an absolute “Aha!” moment for me:
And sorry, no pictures of the Sistine Chapel (it’s forbidden) to which this mere hallway led — — when you emerge into it you simply gawk in awe upwards at Adam touching the hand of God and the surrounding universe of imagery and forget where you came from.
Hidden Gems
Walking through the streets of Rome is like no other city I’ve been in. I mean New York is fast and vibrant, San Francisco friendly and upbeat, but Rome surprises you in a very peaceful, contemplative way. Like casually looking to your right, you see an alleyway entrance to an apartment building, and there’s a classical statue at the end in a little garden. Very nice!
Now this building across the street is most interesting, and the guard looks rightly serious about his job:
My usual gripe on the shortage of public restrooms in modern cities applies, but if you’re thirsty there’s a very nice thing in Rome: public fountains!
It has admittedly been decades since I dared drink from a public water fountain in the U.S., where the stale metallic quality in e.g. Central Park is like from a gym locker, but the water out of those Roman fountains is definitely decent! (after observing many others drinking first, of course).
I have to say I was not impressed with many of my compatriots (surmised by their accents) along the way — — one family accused us of ‘cutting the line’ at the Colosseum, which was patently false, and quite publicly made a ridiculous holier-than-thou scene of it. At restaurants there was almost always a very loud table of Americans with the worst language I have heard outside a drunken frat party. And at the Pantheon one very American-looking woman marched right up to the guard well after closing time and demanded “I want to go in there!” If the patience of the Romans hasn’t caved in by now, it must only be due to the compensating dollars rolling in, but that makes me a bit ashamed.
All I will say is I had pizza every day and never got sick of it! And that was of course just 1% of what we enjoyed …

Ultimate Guide to the Best Places to Run in the World's Major Cities and Destinations. www.greatruns.com @greatruns by Mark Lowenstein

Rome is one of the world’s great cities to visit. Filled with antiquities, wonderful historic sites, lovely old neighborhoods and great restaurants, it’s also a fantastic walking city. The running scene has been improving. Yes, there are busy, traffic-choked roads, tangled lanes difficult to navigate, and the air quality can be poor in the summer — but there are great places to run within proximity to where most travelers stay. Highlights of Rome running include a nearly 9-mile “Rome Sights” tour, including some of the principal landmarks and historic sites (go early or on Sundays!). Running along the Tiber River can be a pleasure, especially since a bike path along part of it was put in a few years ago. Rome’s three largest parks - Borghese, Ada, and Pamphili are also terrific for running. And running on the historic Via Appia Antica and the Parco de Caffarella is one of the most unique runs in the world.
Running in Rome will undoubtedly incorporate some of its famous “seven hills” east of the Tiber, as well as Vatican Hill and Janiculum northwest of the river. In terms of public transport, there is are two metro lines, which go round rather than through the historic city. There’s an extensive bus system.
Rome’s weather is Mediterranean. Summers are hot and dry and can be uncomfortable for running. Spring and fall is almost perfect for running. Winters are mild to cool but rarely cold, with moderate rain. Snow and freezing temperatures are rare.
8.6 miles,with options. Start: near St. Peter’s Square or any point. MAP
This is an attempt to put together a tour of some of Rome’s principal sights. Best to do it early before the streets get crowded and to beat the heat. See this as a ‘city tour’, and take your time! The map starts at Ospedale Santo Spirito, right near St. Peter’s Square, or at any point convenient to where you’re staying. The route follows the outskirts of St. Peter’s and Vatican City (without going into it). Then, just off Via Crescenzio is Castel St. Angelo. Cross the Ponte Cavour, over to the Spanish Steps and the Piazza de Spagna. Then, over to the Trevi Fountain and the Piazza Venezia & Piazza St. Marco. Skirt the Capitoline and the Roman Forum by running along Via dei Fori Imperiali to do a tour of the Coloseum, and then through the Circus Maximus.
Shorter option: take a right out of the Circus Maximus and head over to the famous Ponte Palatino. Cross the bridge and return to St. Peter’s along the river path.,Longer option: takes you through the Trastevere area, near the Passeggiata del Gianicolo, and via Garibaldi back down to the river. Add on even more by going up to Villa Doria Pamphili park.
7 miles ONE-WAY. MAP Start: North: Stado Olimpico. South: Ponte Guglielmo Marconi
Running along the Tiber River in Rome is a great way to go for a run and see the city without dealing with traffic and intersections. Several years ago, the city completed a bike path that runs nearly 7 miles from near Olympic Stadium to Ponte Guglielmo Marconi.
The trail runs through the heart of the most visited sections of the city, but below the roads. It’s a great way to do a dedicated run or to use it as a link to other sites or routes. Note that the path can get flooded fairly easily, often leaving behind a muddy mess. The northern section of the path officially starts south of Olympic Stadium but we start the run at the stadium, since it’s a thrill to see it and do a lap around the track. The southern section concludes at the Ponte Guglielmo Marconi. It is also possible to run on the eastern section of the Tiber.
7 miles Out and Back. Start: Circus Maximus Metro Station. MAP
The Appian Way is one of the earliest and most strategic roads of the Roman Republic. Sections of it remain, and it makes for a one-of-a-kind run. Even the marathon in the 1960 Rome Olympics had a section on this road. On a map, it is called “Via Appia Antica”. The surface is the original stone slab, which can be a challenging surface after a time. However, there is a path alongside for much of the way to ease the run. It is possible to run about six miles south to the perimeter road. The road is generally quiet and is closed to cars on Sundays. Our route starts at the Circus Maximus metro station. A nice option is a loop around the Circus Maximus or use the river path. Viale delle Terme di Caracalla is a good option on the return.
A great option is to combine the Appia with the miles of paths in gorgeous Parco Della Caffarella, where you can combine a run with a visit to the Catacombs. The park is more rural and agricultural in nature, with dirt paths though gorgeous green fields. A very different feel than the busy center city or the more manicured Roman parks such as Villa Ada.
~3 miles. Start: Piazza del Popolo, or Spanish Steps/Porta Pinciana. MAPAdd-Ons: Villa Ada Park, or paths along Tiber River.
At 148 acres, this is the third largest park in Rome. It is centrally located and makes for a great run. It’s possible put together a run of about 3 miles along the paths of the Villa Borghese. Sites include the Villa Borghese Gallery, lovely gardens, Museum of Modern Art, boating lake, and Piazza Napoleone. The paths are wide and gravel, and fairly shaded. Due to its central location, Borghese can be accessed via the Piazza del Popolo or the Spanish Steps/Porta Pinciana, among other options. A nice add-on/combination run is Villa Ada, which is another large park in Rome, less than 2 miles away. Use Via Salaria or Viale Romania. Guided walking tour here.
3 miles of paths. Start: Piazza Bligny. Easily accessed via bus. MAP
At 450 acres, this is Rome’s second largest park. It is more wooded and less finely manicured than Borghese or Pamphili. A private area is under control of the Egyptian embassy. The park has an artificial lake, a public swimming pool, and one can rent canoes, bikes, or horses. In summer there’s the Rome Meets the World Music Festival and numerous other outdoor concerts. For running, there are numerous paths throughout the park, including the perimeter of the fort, totaling ~3 miles. For a longer run, combine with Villa Borghese Park, taking Via Salaria, Via Panama, or Villa Romania to Via Giaocchino Rossini.
~10k of trails in the park. Start: in park,or accessible from St. Peter’s Square or Trastevere area.
Rome’s largest park, Villa Doria Pamphili, contains a stunning, mid- 17th century palace surrounded by garden mazes, jogging trails, fabulous fountains, a superb grotto, and pine lined views of Rome from atop the Janiculum hill. Note that there are not maps inside the park. Your best bet is to run the perimeter paths, which add up to ~10k. There are bathrooms and water fountains near the park entrances.
Good running options to/from the park: From Ponte Sisto, Via Garibaldi, passing through the Trastevere neighborhood and by important landmarks such as the Piazza de Santa Maria, Basilica di Santa Maria, the floodlit Fontana dell’Acqua Paola, and the Garibaldi statue. Mix it up by going through the Passeggiata del Gianicolo monument with the cannon that goes off at noon, or the switchback road, Passeggiata del Gianicolo. This makes for a ~2.5 mile loop, to and from the park.
2–3 miles within site. 2 miles to sea and then along water for 1–2 miles.
Ostia Antica was the harbor city of ancient Rome. It is now a well-preserved archaeological site, about about 18 miles northeast of the city and 2 miles from the Mediterranean. It is a popular tourist destination due to its ancient buildings, frescoes, and mosaics. It’s also easily reachable from Rome via a 1/2 hour train ride and is only a few km from the airport. Ostia Antica makes for a good running option along its ancient roads. The stone surface is similar to the Appian Way, although there is grass/dirt on the side as well. It is about 1.2 miles from one end to the other in the Ostia Antica site (admission required). There are numerous add-on options. There are lovely farm fields on either side of the Antica site. Or, run to the sea, about 2 miles, and then along the water, where there is a separated bike path from Faber Beach to the port, and then a nice jaunt out to the harbor.
Like any major European city frequented by tourists, there is a huge choice of places to stay. Pretty much anywhere you stay in the most visited parts of Rome will provide access to some of the runs in this guide. A few recommendations, for runners.
There are not as many specialty running stores in Rome as in other cities of its size. Each of the major running companies — Adidas, New Balance, Puma, and Nike has a store neat the Villa Borghese. A few of the specialty stores.
Footworks. Centrally located in San Giovanni area. Also close to Villa Ada and Parco Caffarella.
Born to Race. 2.5 miles south of Vila Doria Pamphili
LBM Sport. 1.5 miles north of the Via Appia
Rome has guided tours. And here.
AUR Runs Rome. The American University in Rome has an active club and meets regularly for group runs.
A.S.D. Roma Road Runners Club
Rome Marathon. April. Gorgeous race through the heart of some of Rome’s great sights.
Ostia Half Marathon. The varied course ROUTE is a fast one with some light up-and-down hill stretches. Starting near Palazzo dello Sport, the route runs in Rome, through the entire length of via Cristoforo Colombo then up and down the seafront, 280m each way, to the finish line at the round-about. (La Rotonda).

I don’t know many people who don’t love Italian food.
The pizza. The pasta. And the produce — just ask anyone who has visited an Italian market to describe what they saw there and watch them get all misty-eyed about bitter greens and parmesan. It’s a sight to see — both the markets and people’s reactions to them.
I recently took my fourth trip to Rome. This is a city that grabbed me by the stomach during my first visit in 2008 and has never let go.
It sounds like a cliché but Romans know how to eat and drink very well. It’s what keeps me coming back more than anything else. You can lead this horse to the Colosseum or the Vatican if you must, but I will only drink from the well of Roman food and drink culture.
30,000 steps a day around the city gave me ample time to reflect on how Rome just gets food and drink right. It’s a pleasure here, not a chore. It’s a way of life, not an inconvenience.
And we could learn a thing or two from that.
Start the day in a café, those quintessential third spaces Italy holds so dear.

Hey there, fellow history enthusiasts! Today, I want to take you on a journey through time and explore the forgotten history of one of the most legendary cities in the world – Rome. So grab a drink, sit back, and let's dive right in!
When you think of Rome, you probably envision grand architecture, gladiators, and legendary rulers like Julius Caesar. But did you know that Rome's history stretches far beyond the commonly known spectacular ruins? It's time to unveil some fascinating forgotten secrets!
To start, let's talk about the early beginnings of Rome. It all began as a small village on the banks of the Tiber River in the 8th century B.C. As I'm sure you can imagine, it's come a long way since then!
One of the most significant periods in Roman history was the establishment of the Roman Republic. It was a time of ambitious politicians, mighty generals, and the birth of true democracy. The Romans were all about the law and order, and they did it with style!
Speaking of style, let's not forget about the lesser-known side of Rome – the fashion! Romans were trendsetters of their time, known for their luxurious clothing, intricate jewelry, and even fashionable footwear.
Of course, we can't talk about Rome without mentioning the iconic Colosseum. This incredible structure served as a…

Intro: This is Citations Needed with Nima Shirazi and Adam Johnson.
Nima: Welcome to the Citations Needed live show Beg-a-Thon. Citations Needed is, of course, a podcast on the media, power, PR, and the history of bullshit. As I said, this is one of our periodic Beg-a-Thons, our virtual live show fundraisers. And we’re so glad that you are joining us tonight. Thank you, everyone. I am Nima Shirazi.
Adam: I’m Adam Johnson.
Nima: It’s great to have you all here with us. Of course, you can follow the show on Twitter and Bluesky @citationspod, Facebook Citations Needed, and become a supporter of the show if you’re not already, and this is a Beg-a-Thon, so we obviously would really like you to become a supporter, through Patreon.com/CitationsNeededPodcast. All your support through Patreon is so incredibly appreciated as we are 100% listener funded.
Adam: Yes, and if you become a supporter on Patreon, which, again, is ostensibly the purpose of this Beg-a-Thon, in addition to delightful conversation, edifying everyone, you get access to over 160 News Briefs, show notes and more fun stuff, special episodes, little things we do here and there, live shows, live chats, etc. But most importantly, you get to put your head on the pillow at night and go to sleep knowing that you supported our humble podcast.
Nima: That’s right. And tonight, on Citations Needed, we will be talking about how Elon Musk and his MAGA incel army have appropriated the cultural imagery and aesthetics of Ancient Rome, while obviously neither knowing or understanding anything about the ancient world beyond what maybe they’ve seen in Gladiator or 300.
Adam: To just sort of orient the audience, Trump World, and now increasingly, Elon Musk is effectively the co-vice president, are obsessed with evoking Roman symbols, iconography, to advance a fascist political agenda. I think it’s fair to use the F-word, fascist. We’re going to use that. I know some people dispute that, but I think I don’t really know what else to call it at this point. White nationalist, at the very least. And they present Rome and view Rome, either in meme format or explicitly, there’s even kind of a cottage industry of pseudo-intellectual scholars we can kind of get into as well who pander to these people, YouTubers, etc. They present it as a kind of the platonic ideal of a quote-unquote “Western civilization.” Everyone has their place. There’s a, you know, the kind of Nietzschean values of conquest and domination, how they view the world as being about, you know, rewarding the people with the most merit and the most honor, blah, blah, blah. And we covered this back in 2019 with today’s special guest. And there’s obviously been a lot of that, has gotten charged and heightened lately. And so we wanted to kind of bring her back also, because she has a wonderful book out that I have read. You should definitely read it too. It is excellent.
Nima: It is so good, and we’re going to be promoting it all night. So who are we talking about, Adam? We’re talking about our guest tonight, Dr. Sarah E. bond, Associate Professor in the Classics at the University of Iowa. Hey, Sarah, good to see you. Sarah joins us again after about five and a half years, she was on Episode 82, way back in July of 2019, in the before times, for our show, which was entitled “‘Western Civilization’ and White Supremacy: The Right-Wing Co-option of Antiquity.” So it is amazing to have you back. You, Sarah, are the author, as we said, of the new book Strike: Labor, Unions, and Resistance in the Roman Empire, which is out now from Yale University Press. I’m so excited to get to our conversation with you, Sarah.
But before we do that, we just want to note why we’re doing this tonight, this Beg-a-Thon, this kind of fundraiser that we do periodically. Citations Needed takes a team to make and it takes a ton of work to do each episode. Not many shows do the research that we do at the pace we do it, and since we started the show back in July of 2017, we’ve released well over 200 episodes, more than 160 News Briefs. We’ve welcomed more than 300 guests. We love doing this. We are grateful for each and every listener, every download, every like, every share, tens of thousands of you wonderful people listen to the show every week, and we cannot thank you enough for that. It is amazing. But only a tiny fraction of you actually support the show and our team through Patreon, which is the way that we’re able to keep doing this. And so that is why we are holding this Beg-a-Thon, as we call it, tonight.
Adam: So that was the good cop. I’m gonna do the bad cop. Listen, you mooches. No, I’m just kidding. I’m not gonna neg you, except to say that we are 100% user supported. We get no corporate sponsorships. We get no foundations. I’ll spare you the sanctimonious spiel, but you get the general idea. So if you do listen and you do like it, it actually is very, very helpful if you actually do support it, because, you know, there’s just not a lot of, of the people who listen, just not a high percentage do, and listen consistently. And yes, we have the data, and we’ve geolocated you. We know who you are.
Nima: [Laughs] That’s right. So tonight, we’re asking, if you are able, to please go to our Patreon page. We’ll put the link up there, but it’s very easy to find. It’s Patreon.com/CitationsNeededPodcast. Go help us out there. All right, enough of this garbage. Adam, let’s get to the show.
Adam: Yeah. Let’s get to the show itself. So tonight we are focusing on, again, we are using as a framing device the popularity of our new South African co-president Elon Musk and his minions and his incel army, with Roman iconography and alleged history as a gateway to talk about what is a far richer, more interesting vision of Rome that you’ve written, this excellent book you’ve written, which we’ll get into. So we’re going to start with that hook, and then kind of get into what you wrote about, which is obviously meant to, in some ways, kind of be a counter to that cheesy narrative, which I’m sure we can talk about. So we’re just going to give a little bit of background, Nima.
Nima: Yeah, sure.
Adam: If you want to sort of take over that part, because I know you had the unfortunate task of gathering that background information unfortunately.
Nima: So you know this idea of fascistic elements, neo-Nazis, in the US, namely their collective, now chief avatar, effective President of the United States, Elon Musk, the richest man in the world. They’ve been adopting and co-opting and misunderstanding the aesthetics of Ancient Rome, kind of as a rule, but as a distinct part of their fascistic political project. And one of the most prominent examples of this occurred after Elon Musk himself did a very clear Sieg Heil gesture three times during the inauguration of Donald Trump in January of 2025. Now Musk’s ally, Andrea Stroppa, who lives in Italy and claims to have an advisory role in some of Musk’s companies, posited that’s Musk Sieg Heil was was merely a Roman salute. Stroppa wrote in a now-deleted Tweet, quote, “Roman Empire is back, starting from Roman salute.”
Adam: Now, this was far from the first time that Musk had cited Rome to justify his reactionary ideology and paranoid xenophobia and deeply, deeply unfunny jokes. The guy’s constitutionally incapable of being funny, which is quite a feat. At least Trump’s funny, I guess. Now our guest, Dr. Bond, wrote for the arts news and analysis site Hyperallergic, we’re sorry, we’re going to quote you back at you. It’s one of the ultimate sins of podcasting, but we’re going to do it. Quote,
Musk has a long history of referencing the Roman Empire. His brand of technocratic despotism and its social media iconography has roots in the work of 20th-century European fascists, who were themselves fixated on Ancient Rome. He has long been obsessed with the late Roman Republic dictator Sulla and in December even changed his X avatar to “Kekius Maximus” — a Romanized version of Pepe the Frog dressed in military garb similar to that of Maximus in the film Gladiator (2000). Like Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, the billionaire has frequently expressed admiration for the Roman Empire, posting AI pictures of himself cosplaying as a Roman soldier…
God, that’s sad. You didn’t write that, that’s me, sorry.
…and cooking up theories about why Ancient Rome fell (answer: severe decline in birth rate). He thinks about it every day.
End quote. So let’s begin. I want to sort of bring in Sarah here.
Nima: Yeah, let’s do it.
Adam: We’ve set the table. Before we get into the questions about the actual book you wrote, forgive us, I want you to sort of comment on this piece, what you think superficially people find attractive. I know the elements are kind of obvious, but I want you to kind of dive into why you wrote this piece, why you think it’s important to engage as a historian of Rome with this seemingly popular current on the Nazi, or Nazi-adjacent Right.
Sarah E. Bond: Right, so the piece that I wrote for Hyperallergic, I wrote with Stephanie Wong, who is also a professor of history. She just graduated from Brown. And we write a lot together, because I think that our perspectives are very aligned, and we’re good at writing together, but we had been for years now, because we’ve been, gosh, we’ve been writing and collaborating for six years together, and so we decided that we were going to just collect all the things that he said since about 2020, about Ancient Rome, because I have just a gigantic digital folder of references to Ancient Rome that politicians have made over the years. And many of us who do a lot of reception history, which is just a fancy word for saying how things are repackaged and reused from the ancient world. We had been keeping track of it, and we had written an article together for MSNBC a few years, let’s see, a year and a half ago, on that meme about why people think about the Roman Empire.
And the person that Elon Musk thinks about the most seems to be Sulla, who was a dictator in the middle and early first century BCE. And Sulla eventually does give up power and is not assassinated. He eventually gives it up and retires and hands what’s left of the Republic over to Crassus and Cicero, I’m sorry, Crassus and Pompey, essentially, as the next consoles. But he’s obsessed with Sulla, and that really set off alarm bells in my head, because Sulla wiped out all of his political enemies by the hundreds. And this is something called the proscriptions, and Julius Caesar refuses to do the proscriptions when he becomes dictātor, or dictator, but it is picked back up again as a practice by Octavian Augustus. And so this idea that you can just wipe out all of your enemies and kill them and give people free rein to kill them is something that he’s idealizing, and it seems to be that he’s fixating a lot on. And especially with the purge of the federal government that’s been going on for the past, guys, can you believe that Trump has been president for a month, exactly, almost? It feels like it’s been five years.
Nima: It feels like it’s been 2,000 years.
Sarah E. Bond: It has been four weeks of nonstop layoffs and nonstop purging of the federal government. And I don’t think that’s the same in any way as killing people via the proscriptions, but I do think that Elon Musk likes to make people vulnerable to attack.
Adam: Yeah. Unless you fly a plane. Or rather fly on a plane, I should say.
Sarah E. Bond: I should just say with Elon Musk that we’re talking about aesthetics and idealizing. But I just want to point out something really huge here that was covered by Maya Pontone on Hyperallergic as well, with background from many researchers, myself included, is that Elon Musk has started to give money specifically to archeological projects and projects focused on the ancient world, and that there is a pipeline that is being created from the world of classics into, directly, the world of Elon Musk and this DOGE palace that he’s creating for himself, that we can’t just say that this is a fantasy that he’s playing out, that he gave over $2 million to the Vesuvius Challenge, which decoded a small amount of the papyri from Herculaneum and gave prize money to a young AI engineer named Luke Farritor. And Luke Farritor now works with DOGE and was one of the six engineers that originally went in with Musk a few weeks ago. So it’s not as though we can say, in the world of classics, Oh, we’re just, you know, he idealizes us, but we’re mutually exclusive. We’re in a bubble out here. What can we do about it? It’s like, No, we have people who are taking the money of Musk, the Vesuvius Challenge, as well as, there’s another called the AIRC in Rome, who has also taken money from Musk, and so he’s funding cultural heritage and AI as a way of accessing people that are involved with the ancient world. And you know, it matters who we take money from. It very much matters.
Adam: There’s a risk there, because, again, he did this. He’s obviously done this for years with STEM, where he throws so much money around that your favorite science channel will do these sycophantic reports on him. Science media will do sycophantic reports on him. They’ll get an interview with him and gush over him, even this is, like, sort of post-overt Nazi stuff. And so, yeah, I mean, when you have, again, $400 billion in debt worth, obviously, it’s not totally liquid, but it’s, you know, he could, he could take a loan against it anytime he wants. And, you know, controlling the past is, is because not to be too sort of, you know, I don’t want to be too overly precious–
Nima: You can rage against the machine. It’s okay.
Adam: Well. I mean, you know, He who controls the present controls the past. He who controls the past controls the future. I do think it matters, because then we’re going to be curated. It’s going to be curated, presented in a way that flatters his ideological dispositions.
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, and we’re already seeing that. We have Trump firing the archivist of the United States after she had already deleted and moved around parts of an exhibit that was within the National Archives. And he still fired her. But she had gone in and edited parts of history that were negative, right? And so the presentation of history and the people that are in control of it is what he wants access to, and he wants good press for sure, and he’s trying to buy himself a connection to antiquity in order to conjure legitimacy that we’ve already seen. This is the same MO that Mussolini took to legitimize his power and his rise within fascist Italy.
Adam: He’s basically–
Sarah E. Bond: All you have to do, yeah, you just rebuild the Ara Pacis, right? Rebuild the Res Gestae Divi Augusti, which is exactly what Mussolini does, is invest so many thousands and millions of dollars into the rebuilding of the Roman Forum and the rebuilding of the Roman senate house. This is a playbook we’ve already seen before, because he has no legitimate status within the federal government. So he’s clinging to what he perceives as the only legitimacy that he cares about, which is power from the ancient world.
Nima: Talking about preserving the past and also, you know, as we’re going to get into kind of who is allowed to control our understanding of the past. And we’re going to get into this, this idea of, you know, whether from imperial historians kind of empowered and sponsored to tell the official history of Rome, to this kind of idea of history from below, which you tell through your work, Sarah. I’d love to kind of discuss the overall thesis of your book, which really shows how class conflict and the organized withholding of labor was a consistent feature of Roman life, as were slave revolts, military strikes, other forms of resistance, much of which has been erased or at least reduced to individual stories of heroism in kind of broader ancient, historical retellings, and certainly in the popular mind. How those who don’t study this so closely kind of understand the ancient world, and then certainly Ancient Rome. So what compelled you to write this new book Strike, and what broad image of Rome, both in our pop culture and in kind of more historical consensus, were you attempting to illuminate and edify for us?
Sarah E. Bond: I was going back and re-reading an economic history of Rome from a guy named Tenney Frank, and he was a racist from the turn of the 20th century, like into the 20th century. And, I think it’s 1920, he writes an economic history of Rome, and he thinks that strikes cannot happen because of the number of enslaved people within the Roman Empire. And we do know that within the Italic peninsula, for instance, up to 25% of the population, especially during the the period of the High Roman Empire, so the first two centuries CE, have a large number of enslaved people. And even prior to that, there was a large number. And so he thought that because there were enslaved people, there could never be strikes, because every time you would have artisans going on strike, why wouldn’t you just replace them with other enslaved persons? And that really discounted the professionalization of enslaved people as potters, as weavers, as textile workers, as carpenters, as tavern workers and owners. And his belief that there weren’t strikes kind of infuriated me, and led me to read more about what people thought about strikes, about withholding labor, and what it might have been called in the ancient world.
And it was surprising to me that there just had been so little written on collective action and the withholding of labor in the ancient world, because many people, both Marxists and non-Marxists, had thought that there really weren’t a lot of instances of it. And so in the 19th century, Marx and Engels had believed that the first strikes ever had been the plebeians during what we call the Struggle of the Orders, which really starts in 495 BCE. And if we’re trying to place that, that’s about 15 years after the start of the Roman Republic. So 509, the Roman Republic starts. The last king of Rome is ousted, and we have the start of something we call the res publica, or the republic. And a few years after that, we have the plebeians and the patricians fighting against each other because the patricians are extremely wealthy and they have a lot of power, but also they have a lot of both soft and hard power, in that they monopolize all the magistracies, the consulship, the pontifical colleges, all of the major magistracies, the patricians are, are really dominating.
And so I looked at the Struggle of the Orders, but thought to myself, I think there has to be many more instances of this happening. And so starting to look through things that really didn’t make it into the traditional literary historical record, like papyri and inscriptions, really was the access point to find out that, especially in the Greek world, and going all the way back to the Egyptian world, this had been happening for many thousands of years. And so I started tracing backwards and forwards and finding that there were a lot more instances, because a strike by any other name is still a strike. And so even though the word is not coined until the 18th century in England, because it’s referring to the striking of the top sails of merchant ships in the 18th century, even though that word does not exist in Ancient Rome, that you still have the withholding of labor and the boycotting of certain assigned things like the military levy through calling it a secessio, where we get, for instance, the word secession from. But then when you look in the Greek papyri, they’re calling it an anachoresis, which just means a withdrawal. And for many hundreds and thousands of years, we’ve had workers, especially in Egypt, refusing to work unless they were given emmer and wheat and the right amount of staples to keep working. Sometimes they would just go sit in the back of a temple.
And so for me, it was saying modern people think that strikes are a development of the progressive modern Western civilization post-Industrial Revolution, and as is my wont, I usually like to say to most things, Well, that sounds like bullshit, that that we have created this idea of progressive structure to get to the period that we are now, even though it does not feel that we are in a progressive moment in the least, and to try and unpack why we think that unions and strikes and labor withdrawals, that all of these things are a much more modern development in order to really make us feel a little bit more successful as individuals. And I think we just have to give more credit to the Romans.
Nima: Yeah, I love the idea that, like, a strike by any other name is still a strike that, even if they don’t use that term, because, you know, you actually start your book by talking about how the term was coined, the striking of sails in a British port. But then going back to Deir el-Medina, the strike in Egypt, and then kind of tracing that up through history is just, I think, really, really fascinating to see how, in a world that is built on the on the backs of laborers, the power that is held through withholding labor, has been recognized, not just, you know, since the Industrial Revolution, but you know, for thousands and thousands of years.
Adam: On some level, the idea that people around the world would withhold labor is, it does seem sort of self-evidently obvious, because what other leverage do you have as a laborer? And 99% of humans throughout history have been laborers, typically exploited in any kind of semi-developed sense that would be exploited by some rich asshole who lived on the hill. It doesn’t. It’s not a huge leap to say that this is a kind of universal, that there’s an evolutionary convergence to land on some form of strike, right? And what you argue is that while that is true, there was also more sophisticated antecedents that made these more coordinated, more and more sophisticated than we maybe thought.
And one of the things we talk about is these associations, which were both kind of, which were not these kind of perfect Marxist organizations, in the sense that they were oftentimes kind of business trade groups. They didn’t fit along these kind of perfectly, you know, Maoist lines, but in many ways they what you do argue is that they could be instrumentalized to carry out something we would recognize as a labor strike, and that because of the way history is written, you specifically talk about Levy and others, because of the inherently elite nature of reading and writing and how history is created, the first draft, second draft, third draft, that those stories get flattened or obscured.
And you even have this great section, I won’t read it back to you, because I’d like you to talk about it, about the ways in which mob violence is flattened. When you say that oftentimes, as a class dimension, that is fairly obvious, but in the history books, it’s kind of written off as just mob violence. And you even draw some parallels to current examples, when mass unrest is sort of stripped of its ideology, which I thought was a really fascinating, really interesting part of the book. Can you talk about the ways in which–
Nima: Cicero was just doing what the New York Times does now.
Adam: Well, yeah, by the way, I found out he did, The the shrimp store called and they’re running out of you, The jerk store called, where he would, I didn’t realize this until I read Mary Beard’s book, that he would write what he said on the Senate floor later on, which seems like cheating. And then people presented it as like, He’s this great orator, and it’s like, You just got to go back and rewrite it. Anyway. Talk, if you could, about the these associations, how they provided the kind of framework to make a more sophisticated form of labor unrest, and if you could also talk about the ways in which historians, for obvious reasons, who were wealthy or patrician or what have you, decided to kind of say, Oh, that was just mindless, ideology-free violence.
Sarah E. Bond: I think when we create homogenous groups, when we call everybody a mob, that’s already a pejorative, it’s already casting them into negative rhetoric. And the Romans are no different. They like to use very large, amalgamous nouns, a turba, a multitudo, that is to just say, a gigantic negative word for a crowd, right? And when you just say crowd, you aren’t allowing for organization, you aren’t allowing for hierarchy, you aren’t allowing for structure. And although we don’t get a ton of anatomies of crowds from the ancient world, we can see, especially in the late Republic, that a lot of groups that are coming together, what we call collegia, and that’s where we get the modern word college from. A collegium, in the singular, is just a group of people. In Roman law, you have to be three or more people to be considered a collegium. And we have about 3,200 inscriptions in papyri that give reference to these various groups that really grow in number in the early Hellenistic period forward.
So from the death of Alexander the Great forward, people increasingly are creating groups for various reasons. So you could have a group that is focused on Dionysus, because who doesn’t want to get together and drink some wine and have a nice bacchanalia? But you could also form a group, if you were merchants or trades people living on the island of Delos, and you’re human traffickers, and you need to have a workflow, essentially, that moves people throughout the Mediterranean. You can move bread through it, in terms of wheat and flour, you may need to have a supply chain to give you precious jewels, pepper, cinnamon, lots of things that you might want to trade, or you might just be a carpenter and want to have other carpenters that you work with.
And so these collegia are proliferating, especially into the period of the Republic. Many of them don’t have enough money to meet in a proper schola, which is a clubhouse. And so lots of them do what many confraternities have always done, and that is meet in a public house, called a pub. And so you go to a tavern, the tavern keeper allows you to sit there and to congregate. And when we try and understand the movements within the late Republic, one of the things that I think is important to see is that these groups are coming together extremely quickly, in a very organized manner, in order to hear public speeches called contiones. And so my question is, Okay, we have rhetoricians like Cicero, who’s calling them just a gigantic mob, but in reality, he’s giving us clues that say that they’re starting in a specific sector that artisans are known to live within, and that the tavern keepers are involved in it. And to me, trying to reconstruct the underlying structure is very important, because a lot of that gets erased in the name of marginalizing them. And marginalizing vocabulary is something that we’ve seen, especially since 2020. When you marginalize a crowd, we saw this even with Occupy Wall Street as well, is that, yes, Occupy Wall Street actually was quite organized, even though, yes, they were very against hierarchy and a lot of the traditional leadership structures, but we really see that it’s elite people who tend to call crowds mobs.
So whether it’s Black Lives Matter, whether it’s any other social movement, it deprives them and really robs them of their peaceful protest and of their organization. And I think that this is something that always has happened, is that really wealthy people, if you want to completely marginalize a movement, you just simply call them a mob. And that just is an unjust way to label many groups, not all groups, but I think a lot of groups have been robbed of their legitimacy by being called a mob, because immediately you think of violence and criminality and also anti-patriotism, and that’s something that with unions, for instance, if we go back to Garfield, President Garfield, not the cat. I mean, I like the cat, too.
Adam: No relation.
Sarah E. Bond: No, no relation. President Garfield, he hated unions, and he thought they were unpatriotic, and he thought of them as just individuals who incited mob violence. And so it’s not hard to trace and to track down the ways in which we marginalize groups of people, individually, but also groups that are coming together in order to fight for their rights.
Nima: But it’s not just in rhetoric, right, Sarah? I mean, because also then the discourse and the language and the denigration also turns into policy or legislation, and we see that now, you know, with anti-protest legislation across the country, whether that is, you know, from campus protests against genocide in Palestine or, you know, long before, anti-assembly legislation. But you also talked about this in your book Strike, about how the elites and the wealthy call associations or call, you know, regular people getting together, not only a mob, but then they kind of legislate against it. Talk about where that came from, and some of the parallels there.
Sarah E. Bond: I think we’re all thinking about anti-assembly legislation, especially since October 7, and thinking about groups coming together and protesting against the treatment of Palestinians especially. I visited the groups that were on the quad at the University of Chicago. We had a very small group at the University of Iowa, for instance, and many campuses across the country were. Pushing them off of public property. Now, the University of Chicago is a private school. That’s a little bit different, but we even saw this at public schools that people were getting arrested, that they were not allowed to assemble, even when they were just peaceably in their tents and just sitting there.
So I think that we’ve been thinking about freedom of assembly and whether that is a civil right and to what extent it should be protected. And when we go back to the ancient world, we see that freedom of assembly was something that very wealthy elite people like senators and the emperor were very, very anxious about. And it’s not something that is new, that, especially for instance, Julius Caesar and Octavian moved to make legislation very soon into their periods of rule that say, Okay, well, you know, collegia, maybe they can, they can meet at certain times, but predominantly we’re going to have them disband unless they’re the oldest collegia that have ever been established, and if they have a public utility, right?
And this idea of the civic good that a collegium has to serve the civic good, it’s tying into this idea of patriotism, again, is that freedom of assembly is only extended if it is for the good of the res publica, but when you get into the Empire, the res publica does not really exist anymore. It’s a false reconstruction that Augustus has made, right? He calls it the reconstruction of the res publica, but come on, it’s an empire. It is the empire that he is building, and he is the imperator. And so what he’s really saying when he disbands collegia and when he begins to threaten freedom of assembly more and more, is that I don’t want myself threatened by this, and I don’t want any public discord that might turn into resistance against me.
And the smothering of resistance before it can really ever get a lot of steam is just something that is quite common within the Roman Empire. People think that they’re, Oh, you know, the Roman Empire was so good to live in that there was just no resistance, right? Like after Spartacus, we have, Oh, very little, except for maybe the Jewish Wars that are in Judea. And that’s just not true, because everyday resistance, the act of forming a union, the act of engaging in a labor strike, right, the act of pushing against this revoking of freedom of assembly, everyday resistance, is just as important as these gigantic rebellions. They don’t just formulate out of nothing. And so I think that freedom of assembly has always been revoked and questioned and placed as something unpatriotic, because those in power have always known that when people get together, they have more power collectively than they do apart, and that’s why the motto of the United States is E Pluribus Unum, one out of many. And right now, we’re seeing a shift to just the unum part, but not really the people as much a part of it. So that’s something that is really scary to see Trump tweet out, “LONG LIVE THE KING!” It was something that gave me chills, because I immediately thought of the late Roman Republic.
Adam: So I want to sort of back up here a little bit and sort of maybe circle back with what we talked about with your book, with the sort of more topical themes about the rightwing fascination with Rome. And it’s superficial, albeit superficial, which is, I mean, look. Rome as a sort of idea is the way we sort of perceive the West, right? You know, it wasn’t till the late ’90s that to graduate from Oxford, you had to know Latin. It is, it is the way in which academics and intellectuals and scientists talk to each other, up until, again, whatever, the 1800s. Rome, obviously, is kind of what we what, what is viewed as, as Europe, as a sort of, for want of a better term, white civilization, despite the fact that it, of course, wasn’t one in any meaningful sense. But that’s certainly how it’s been idealized as it’s gone through its various white supremacist historical laundromats throughout the decades. And so it kind of makes sense why people who are kind of adrift, or don’t really have any firm, who aren’t very firmly committed into any kind of ideology, would be drawn to it because of its proximity to, it’s sort of a more politically correct form of white nationalist sort of mythmaking.
And so, in some sense, does it make sense why a sort of mediocre, you know, internet-addled dope like Musk would would, again, superficially be into it. He sort of praised Mike Duncan’s podcast, much to Mike Duncan’s chagrin. It all kind of makes sense, because it is this sort of idealized, white, sort of heroic version of themselves and in a weird way, I know I mentioned her book before, but Mary beard’s book SPQR, at the very end, she has this line that’s clearly in dialogue with that, where she says, I get asked a lot, you know, basically been working on this book for 50 years, I get asked a lot, What do we have to learn from modern society in Rome? And I’m paraphrasing here, forgive me if I’m misrepresenting this. But she kind of says, Basically nothing. And I don’t think she meant that, like in a non-, in a sort of anti-intellectual way. I think she was, it appeared to be in the context it was written to be responding to these people constantly saying we’re at the end of the Roman Empire, because it’s so cliche, right? Isaac Newton said it. I mean, every 10 years we’re, you know, we’re in the end. Everyone likes to talk about the fall of the Roman Empire, because what are you criticizing? Homophobia, right? You sort of, you’re trafficking the idea of, we’re becoming effeminate, we’re becoming weak. Blah, blah, blah, the meme Strong Men Create Good Times, Good Times Create Weak Men.
Sarah E. Bond: A lot of immigration. They really like to harp on immigration.
Nima: That’s right. The barbarians are coming.
Sarah E. Bond: Right. The barbarians at the gates. Yes.
Adam: So if you could, if you would comment a bit about or rather, it’s a little bit open-ended, but I want you to talk about why you think that the mythology, the white supremacist mythology of Rome, appears to be increasing, but has kind of survived and what you think, to what extent do you feel like some, you know, I don’t want you to name names necessarily, but what extent pop history movies have really contributed to that, where they do have this very one-note kind of vision of what, not to sort of blame them for it necessarily, one-note vision of Rome?
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, I did review Gladiator, too. So we just, I mean, I reviewed it for Hyperallergic and I think a lot of the misconceptions about Rome are very entertaining. That when it goes on film, who doesn’t like watching the first Gladiator in the year 2000? And all of the things that are being picked up on and received, right as it’s being filmed at the end of the Clinton administration, is talking about, We can bring Rome back. We can bring the Republic back. Now that’s absolute bullshit, because Marcus Aurelius, in no way ever wants to bring back the Republic. There is no hint of evidence. He had always set Commodus as being the one that was going to be his successor. But this idea that the Republic could come back, that was a romantic idea of the year 2000 that then resurfaces this year with the latest Gladiator, 25 years later, really, 24 years later, coming to the surface, this idea that the Republic could come back. So I think that there are some people who really want to see a genuine resurfacing of proper governance, or some sort of governance that people influence in some way. And so I’m not saying that Gladiator II is completely innocuous, because there are a lot of things wrong with that movie, but they are entertaining. Whether there were sharks in the amphitheater or not, and there were not sharks in the amphitheater, sorry.
Adam: Aw, boo. Sarah! Let me live the lie.
Sarah E. Bond: You could fill the Colosseum with water. It was watertight. So that’s true, you can have a sea battle in the Colosseum, but there were not sharks.
Adam: They got a little greedy with the sharks. They got a little greedy.
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, the CGI was just too far. So there are innocuous things, I think, like sharks in the Colosseum, that I’m really fine with. It’s just that this love affair with the fall of Rome is this idea that, especially conservatives, but we also have liberals who have written horrendously facile op-eds about the fall of Rome as well, that they can be the prognosticators using history. So they’re not only making themselves look extremely cerebral and extremely knowledgeable about quote-unquote, “Western Civ,” they’re also telling the future, and that gives them a level of power within the public sphere, and what they perceive of as the intellectual community, that gives them some sort of currency that they’ve read Gibbon. Well, who hasn’t read Gibbon? There are a lot of people that have read Gibbon. He published a two-volume set in 1776, guys, okay? There are no spoilers here. Everybody kind of knows what Gibbon has said.
But Gibbon is also speaking about the late 18th century. Everybody who is writing history, including myself, is thinking about the time period that they are living in. And I just think that, going back to this idea of the fall of Rome, is not only regurgitating and recycling Gibbon, which it clearly is, but it’s trying to send out a message that I am the truth teller, so please put your trust in me, and that’s essentially what op-eds are supposed to do anyways, right? Like I’m an opinion writer, I have a thousand words, I’m going to sway you that what I’m telling you is significant. It’s just that they get the history so wrong, especially, I would say when it comes to talking about religion and talking about, also, immigration, and talking about what really brought down different component parts of Rome, because Rome doesn’t fall monolithically together as one. That we have fracturing, that we have going in different directions, that many areas like North Africa stay extremely strong up to the Vandal invasion and things like this. So I mean, it’s just this idea that they can read the tea leaves through their historical abilities. And it’s just very wrong.
Adam: Yeah, and I’m going to read here from the Nixon tapes. He was obsessed with this idea. He ranted about it a lot. Quote,
You ever see what happened, you know what happened to the Greeks? Homosexuality destroyed them. Aristotle was a homo, we all know that. So was Socrates… Do you know what happened to the Romans? The last six Roman emperors were fags.
He concludes by saying,
You see, homosexuality, dope, immorality in general, these are the enemies of strong societies. That’s why the communists and the left-wingers are pushing the stuff: they’re trying to destroy us.
To be fair, I do do that. He’s got me there. But this is, again, this is so cliche. This has been done a billion times. The idea that, so much of the Roman, and you know, people would say, generally, corruption is what they’re really kind of referencing. But really it’s this idea of, again, Musk is obsessed with this idea of feminization. Again, he’s into weird kind of Silicon Valley natalist cults. He’s apparently doing some kind of panspermia experiment to half of California right now. I guess he’s on his 13th kid. And so it’s like this, this idea of, again, immigration, lack of white fertility, homosexuality, is like they all, they want to see it in Rome in a way that, of course, is not there, but that, of course, doesn’t really matter.
Nima: Well, I think what’s interesting also is, is, you know, the obsession with the kind of emperor or or even patrician class from some of the wealthiest people on the planet kind of makes sense, right? There’s a corollary there. It’s not just Musk. Also Mark Zuckerberg names his kids after, you know, Roman emperors. There’s a whole thing, weird thing going on. But, Sarah, I’d love for you to talk about how, how it’s not just, you know, the wealthy that kind of see themselves as part of that tradition, and kind of wanting to bring that back, that kind of makes sense, right? Like the people in charge want to be like the people in charge, but it’s for the workers and the people who glom on to this aesthetic as well, who all see themselves as warriors, not as other kinds of workers, right? I mean, we’re seeing farmers in the United States right now gutted by the cuts that have just been made to USAID. You know, hit hardest. You know, American farmers. That is not the kind of imagination that people storming the Capitol, or people excited about, you know, stanning for Musk on Twitter, like, they’re not seeing themselves as the people. They’re seeing themselves as these kind of like delayed warriors with the, you know, with the helmets and the crest and the Gladius by their side. Like, you know, where do you think that kind of comes from and how, how is that shaped by how we understand history, which I think your book starts to really unpack, like, who the people really are, and how we hear their stories, the kind of people’s history, not only of Rome, but of ourselves.
Sarah E. Bond: I think the idea of the American Dream is that we can always pull ourselves up from our bootstraps and be Musk, I mean, to be the richest man in the world. A lot of people imagine that they are capable of that, and we know that a very small number of people are ever able to ascend from poverty into the very wealthy 1%. And Musk isn’t even somebody, I mean, he comes from a family of emerald mine owners in South Africa. Trump comes from money. These are all nepo babies, okay, but this idea of the American Dream is that if you work hard enough, you can ascend. But part of that also is this idea of masculinity that is inextricably linked to Roman soldiers. And so if we go back to January 6 and the storming of the Capitol, there were people with signs where Trump was dressed like Maximus. Maximus, again, is not a historical figure there. It’s not real. Russell Crowe is playing a fictional character. But they are imagining themselves to be the highest order of masculinity. And the visualization of that, the kind of allegory that we have assigned to masculinity is the Roman centurion. And so, you know, just yesterday, I was looking at the new picture of Odysseus that was released for Christopher Nolan’s new version of The Odyssey. I want to see it. I’m going to see it, right? But Matt Damon has a crested helmet on that is very much not exactly what would have been worn in the Trojan War, but it is a crested helmet that is kind of very much emblematic of later soldiers that that are fighting, because the Greek phalanx and Sparta, etc., also is a symbol of masculinity.
And so when you try and question those constructions, people get very upset, because especially white men, tend to idealize both Spartan soldiers and also Roman centurions and soldiers as their everyday lives, like, This is how I should go through life. And these are people that don’t quite realize that if they were transported back to the ancient world, the vast chances are that they would be an enslaved person or a farmer or perhaps an artisan or a potter that’s making ceramics, and many of those also fought as soldiers in the earlier period of The Republic, when we have citizen armies. Enslaved persons usually did not but they were incorporated into the military in other ways. But yeah, I really think that it’s, it’s tied up in aesthetics of masculinity.
And I love that Adam said earlier that this is history laundering instead of money laundering, because that’s just exactly what it is. All of the actual, real colors of history have bled out, right? They’ve faded. They’ve been laundered to death, and now it just doesn’t even look like it actually was. It is a meme, and that’s exactly how memetic things work, is just continue to be recycled until they don’t really resemble the past in any real way. So the book is, in large part, trying to bring back the voices of just regular enslaved peoples, freed people, that is to say people who are manumitted, which is also a large part of the population, and they may not seem as sexy as a centurion, but we have the ability to redefine what sexy is. And I think that merchants who form a collegium and go on strike or sexier to me than a centurion that is running into battle. But yeah, I think there’s many books that are incorporated into this and that have been written and will be written on the reception of Roman history and white supremacy, but I think it all comes down to this feeling that, that this is the ultimate, this is the epitome of what it means to be a man.
Nima: Right. I mean, it’s really interesting that you mentioned, you know, that Russell Crowe is, you know, just an actor. Maximus doesn’t, doesn’t really exist. And in your book, you note that actors actually may have been the first in Ancient Rome to form what could be deemed like a proto-union, right? So, like, again, who is the everyday person, who are the people that are really organizing? Who is afforded the protections? Is it the you know, emperors, or is it the artisans?
Adam: I don’t want to let you go without asking about the viral popularity from 2016, then 2019, then it was huge during COVID, of Marcus Aurelius meditations and like Stoicism as this kind of masculine ideal. Ryan Holiday is kind of a hack writer, wrote a book about it, has a podcast about it.
Sarah E. Bond: We call that Broicism, by the way.
Adam: Broicism, sorry, and this is, apparently, it was, it’s been all the rage, and there was a viral lecture on it that was very sort of rah-rah that went viral during COVID. Again, on some level, one can see I actually read it. It was beyond tedious. But I stuck it out. I definitely don’t meet the the platonic ideal of a Stoic. As those listening to the show may be aware, I sometimes complain. And so I want you, I want to ask a little bit about, again, the sort of cartoon version versus the kind of real version. And it mean, again, these book sales, these podcasts are popular, these TikToks are very popular. This is, this is legitimately popular, and this is the primary entry point into Roman history for a lot of people. So talk, if you could, about the rise of Broicism and how, I don’t know if you, if you engage with this with a lot of undergrads or whatever, and talk about where you see it happen.
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, I want to say, if you’re going to buy a translation of Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations, my professor, whose name is Gregory Hays, I believe, wrote the best translation. So if we’re going to give actual money to anybody for buying Stoicism, and please don’t do those Instagrams that are like Stoicism Every Day, I’m going to send Stoicism and witticisms to your inbox, which half the time they’re fake. They’re fake quotes from Seneca. They’re fake quotes from Cicero. They’re fake quotes from Marcus Aurelius, etc. In any case, translations, who you choose to translate your words are extremely important. So yes, pick your translator carefully, number one. Number two, I think that if we think about technocrats and why this philosophy is extremely alluring to them, we can think about the fact that when you are a Stoic, you have to be happy with your lot in life, and it really behooves technocrats to have coders, to have people that are working within their companies, have a philosophy where they come to work and they’re like, You know, Gosh, darn. I’m just happy to be here. I’m going to be the best coder that I could be, right? And when we read things like Epictetus, then we think, Oh, I will be the best enslaved person that I could possibly be. But let’s face it, when you write the Meditations as Marcus Aurelius, and you say, I’m happy with my lot in life, well, you fucking should be. You are the emperor! You are the emperor! And so Elon Musk adopting Stoicism, which he really is not a Stoic in any stretch of the imagination.
Adam: No, I don’t think Stoics would post 50 tweets a day. Yeah.
Sarah E. Bond: No, no, no. This is not a man that I associate with Stoicism. But many technocrats within the area of the Silicon Valley have begun to glom on to this idea, because it is an opiate of the masses, essentially, as a philosophy. If everybody actually adopted it, then you would have people who aren’t trying to buck the system, that they are not trying to rebel, that they are not trying to modify the system in any way. They are trying individually to work internally on being the best person that they can be, but to reinforce the social hierarchy that already exists. I mean, this is not about transforming the society. It’s about reinforcing the status quo. And right now, the amount of social inequality that we have very much benefits extremely wealthy people. These are just wealthy people that want to maintain their wealth to an even higher degree, and Stoicism is a philosophy that supports their thesis, which is, I am awesome and have a lot of money that I wish to keep. And so they’ve only adopted the philosophy post-thesis.
Nima: And everyone else needs to be cool with that, too.
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, get with it! Come on, guys! This is part of the world that we live in, so just pacify yourself. Go forward and come to the office. Do not stay at home and do not work from home. We want you in an office. We want you doing the tasks that we are asking you to do. And please don’t question it, because questioning leads to disruption, and they don’t want disruption. They simply want to rule. And so yeah, I think Stoicism as a philosophy is very attractive to them and also to people who would like to be wealthy. And as we’ve already kind of talked about, this idea of the American Dream makes people believe that they, too, could be this technocrat in the future. So get with it. But yeah, I don’t think it’s very, I’m much more Epicurean. I know you could probably guess that.
Adam: Yeah. We did a whole episode on the kind of David Goggins, self-help, Tiktok world and again, on some some level, I’m sympathetic, because if there is a drudgery in your job, which, again, I know, I’m sure all of us have here had a drudgery job, you have to hold on to something to sort of make it make sense. But again, there’s a reason why your boss wants you to read Marcus Aurelius, and rather than a union organizer, he’s like, Wait. It’s basically the Mike Rowe sweat pledge. So I want to ask one more question before we go, because we’d be remiss if we didn’t talk about the GOAT, Spartacus, and the Servile Wars and obviously, revolts by enslaved people in general, which, of course, there was quite a few of them. Can we talk a little bit about because again, that would be like the sort of entry point into a discussion about labor that is broadly popular, you know, Kirk Douglas with his shirt off.
Nima: Tony Curtis.
Adam: Sorry, with all due respect to Tony Curtis. Talk about that, the sort of popularity of that narrative, again, it’s reduced to this kind of heroic narrative. But like, where did that, where was that oriented into this broader associations framework, and how people kind of mimic these structures, and what lessons can be drawn from that that are not this kind of cartoon, you know, Marcus Aurelius sitting here telling you how to, you know, how to eat shit and suck it up?
Sarah E. Bond: Well, I think Spartacus as a folk hero does not really gain a lot of steam until around the period of the French Revolution and a little bit before. So in terms of his revival, up until that point, people knew who Spartacus was, of course, he is written about by people like Appian and Plutarch, etc. That we have three Servile Wars. The first one is in Sicily in the end of the second century BCE, then we have another one that formulates out of Sicily a few years later. Spartacus himself is a few decades after that, and he’s not on Sicily. He is breaking out of a gladiatorial school in the area of Southern Italy, and Spartacus is seen by the contemporary sources and the sources that are not long thereafter as a rebel and a rabble-rouser. And of course, they’re not going on strike. They fully want freedom and never to come back to their jobs again. They do not want to return to being gladiators, so they’re not leveraging their labor in any way. They want to go free. And my belief is that they really should have, when they got towards the Alps, to continue going, but they circle back and they come back into the Italic peninsula, and I always want to yell like, Keep going, Spartacus! Keep going! But he’s not a hero in his own day. He may have been with enslaved persons. We don’t have a lot of their narratives or reactions to him, but during the period of the French Revolution, into later political campaigns in the 18th and then 19th and then 20th century, Spartacus gains more and more as a folk hero of freedom and rebellion against tyranny, whether it was in Prussia, where he was extremely popular. He became very popular in France and in the United States, and especially during the Haitian Revolution, where Toussaint Louverture takes the name of Black Spartacus. He’s given that name, but he is seen as, you know, this Haitian revolutionary leading enslaved persons to fight against enslavement within the island of Haiti, right? So all of these things build Spartacus’s hero worship, but the movie in 1960 really is what does it to the highest degree,
Adam: Written by a communist. No shocker there. Written by Dalton Trumbo.
Sarah E. Bond: Exactly. And it’s during the period of the blacklist. You know, they’re blacklisting communists after McCarthyism. That Spartacus is really about fighting against The Man. And I see Spartacus absolutely as the GOAT and a hero that should be celebrated. But we have to also remember that he was working within a gladiatorial troupe, and that gladiatorial troupe lives within the gladiatorial school, and they coordinate together. Spartacus has lieutenants that he works with, but he has a group of people that are very close to him that mobilize in a very planned rebellion in the gladiatorial school. They go to the kitchen, and they grab utensils and knives and break out of the gladiatorial school. And then, as they are moving through Italy, whether to Vesuvius, or whether going north, etc, they are gaining more and more enslaved persons in a very organized manner, up to about 100,000 people.
And this is during a period when Roman slavery had been growing so quickly. Over the past 200 years, Roman slavery had expanded to a level that that had never seen before, and the number of enslaved people was so high within the Italic peninsula. So, I mean, I think Spartacus deserves all of those kudos, but we also have to ask ourselves about other enslaved people into the period of the Empire, and part of that is looking at enslaved people that rebel against Rome, whether they’re mint workers, whether they’re charioteers, whether they’re bear trainers, that we never have a slave revolt that is to the level of Spartacus that we know of within the Roman Empire for the rest of its existence, there’s never a rebellion that is to the degree that Spartacus inspired and carried out, but that there are still enslaved people that went on strike and that engaged in joining collegia.
And so circling back to that first thesis that I was talking about, just because enslaved people exist within a society does not mean that there cannot be labor organization and that there cannot be people working together for a higher purpose, right? And so sometimes that purpose is manumission, and sometimes that purpose is to get higher wages. But just because they’re enslaved does not mean that they’re completely impotent or without any power within this labor economy.
Nima: Well, I think that is a perfect place to leave it. Sarah, this has been so wonderful, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on this Citations Needed livestream Beg-a-Thon. It has been truly wonderful to talk to you, Sarah. We have been speaking with Dr. Sarah E. Bond, Associate Professor in the Classics at the University of Iowa. You do have, like, a longer title: Erling B. “Jack” Holtsmark?
Sarah E. Bond: I’m an endowed chair in the history, I’m technically in the History Department with an appointment in Classics. I have a chair. It does not matter.
Nima: I feel like I need to read that title. It’s very prestigious.
Sarah E. Bond: It doesn’t, well, it doesn’t mean that much, except for, you know, that I feel very lucky to have the job that I do, that this is my job, that I get to do all day. So that’s good enough.
Nima: Yeah, that’s very Stoic of you.
Sarah E. Bond: I see what you did there. I see what you did there.
Adam: She’s the emperor, though. That’s objectively a great job.
Nima: Sarah, of course, is the author of the incredible new book. Adam and I both read it.
Adam: We actually read it. We didn’t fake-read it. We actually read it.
Nima: Man, is it fucking great. So please pick it up. The book is, of course, Strike: Labor, Unions, and Resistance in the Roman Empire, out now from Yale University Press. But Sarah, thank you so much for joining us today on Citations Needed. It has been amazing to have you.

“Though you are a whole world, Rome, still, without love, the world’s not the world, and Rome cannot be Rome.” — Goethe
This book. I had this idea of traveling based on the books I was reading, and after nearly four years in Rome, I realized I had never read a book about the city itself. Perhaps I was too caught up in my daily struggles — and let me tell you, my life in Rome hasn’t been easy. Maybe my expectations were too high, or, as Goethe said, love was simply absent, and Rome wasn’t truly Rome to me. But this isn’t my story. Let’s get back to Anthony Doerr’s memoir.
As I write my humble thoughts on this memoir, I find myself flipping through its pages, revisiting the passages I underlined — the moments that touched my heart, the parts where I saw my own Roman story reflected. To be honest, Doerr’s first impressions of Rome mirrored how I felt after a year, maybe a year and a half, of living here.
I came to Rome for my master’s degree — my second one, actually — not just for academic reasons but as a way to escape Istanbul, to finally do something I had long felt was inevitable. I had always known my story wasn’t meant to unfold in just one city or country, though I had imagined it would be London, not Rome.
And yet, when I finally opened my eyes and truly started feeling Rome, it was exactly as Doerr described: noticing the endless sea of scooters, marveling at (or being horrified by) Italian driving, being simultaneously enchanted and frustrated by the city. In those early days, I was also angry — maybe disappointed — by what I had found here. And as I read through the beginning of Four Seasons in Rome, I could feel that same unease in Doerr’s words.
Throughout the pages, you experience what it’s like to be a parent to newborn twins — and, honestly, I’d much rather live that experience through his eyes than my own. But being in a foreign country doesn’t make it any easier. Even though our circumstances were different, there was one feeling we both shared: navigating this city while feeling lost — most of the time.
The missing piece, though, is love. I’m not sure if I should call myself fortunate, but in that regard, I’ve been quite lucky — if letting my heart get broken over and over counts as luck. I found real love here and lost it here. I cried here. I lost hope here. And yet, to truly experience Rome, love wasn’t necessary. As Doerr writes:
“And what about Rome? Rome is beautiful, Rome is ugly. Something about this city exacerbates contrast, the incongruities and contradictions…”
Rome has a way of filling that void in its own way, making sure you feel everything — whether you want to or not.
In the beginning, or let’s say during Fall, the book feels more factual, focused on adjustment. Doerr shares details about Rome, its quirks, its history. But as we move into Spring and Summer, we witness — or at least I felt — his gradual acceptance of the city, his growing appreciation for its beauty. And in these later chapters, the book shifts into something deeper. Not overwhelming, not philosophical, but it subtly invites the reader to take a step back, to ask certain questions, to reflect.
You should take note of the places Doerr mentions in this book — mostly around Monteverde, one of my favorite areas in Rome.
I’m not sure if anyone would be interested, so I won’t be sharing my full Roman guide, but I do want to give a shoutout to my favorite restaurants for the best carbonara. Why?
When I first moved to Rome, I was almost vegetarian — pescatarian, to be exact. While my friends indulged in legendary plates of pasta alla carbonara, I could only watch and wonder what all the fuss was about.
Then, for love, I started eating meat again. To be precise, I now eat guanciale, Italian cold cuts, poultry, and seafood — so really, there’s not much left off the menu, is there?
Naturally, my return to the eating-it-all era had to start with the famous carbonara. This passion quickly turned into a habit — I now order pasta alla carbonara every time I dine out. Here are some of my favorite spots to enjoy it:
I could go on forever — food is my passion, after all. But I suppose this article was meant to be about a book.
Okay, back to the book:
I’m so envious of Doerr for writing such a brilliantly pure, beautifully written book. No flashy marketing of la dolce vita — God knows I’m tired of the glossy image of Rome when the reality is far from dolce. He presents it all in a way that feels honest, and I couldn’t help but see parallels between the way Rome made him feel and the way I’ve felt since moving here.
I envy him even more because he came to Rome for a set period, with no trouble finding an apartment (thank you, Pope, honestly), which gave him the opportunity to experience the city without the complications that often come with living here. Or maybe the struggle is the true Roman experience. I’m not sure… Rome is my great dilemma and paradox.
Overall, I’m glad I don’t have to experience this city with newborn twins. I’m grateful for the daily challenges of living here and for the chance to experience life in its raw, unfiltered form. Rome is a beautiful city, though flawed in many ways. I can’t see myself growing old here — but that’s for purely professional reasons.
Finally, the author’s writing is captivating. Whether you live here or not, perhaps in another place, you’ll find yourself immersed in his story through his eyes. I absolutely loved this memoir, and it’s definitely a must-read. As he wrote:
“Roma, they say, non basta una vita. One life is not enough.”

When I tossed a small Italian lira coin into the Trevi fountain back in June 1987, it was to ensure my return to Rome someday, in accordance with the famous legend. On the cusp of turning 17, I had all the optimism in the world that I would indeed be back. And I was right. It just took a few decades. But lucky for me, Rome is known for being eternal and was waiting here for me.
A lot has changed since I was last here. My sunken coin is, of course, long gone. The lira isn’t even Italy’s currency anymore, having been replaced by the euro in 2002. Most importantly, I now have a greater appreciation of history than I did as a teenager. Back then, I just wanted to meet European boys, get served alcohol underage, and go out dancing with my friends. My pictures were mostly of our silly fun in hotel rooms or on the bus, and my more serious scenic ones came out dark, blurry, or had my finger in them.
This time around, I plan to mix sightseeing and trying to live like a local for a month, much like I did when I spent 30 days in Paris working remotely last summer. Exploring all of the Roman ruins there inspired me to head right to the source. My great-grandparents came to the United States from Italy, so I also want to soak in the Italian culture on a deeper level and make time for some quiet moments sitting in parks just observing people or while walking ancient roads like the old Appian Way.
I only had a few days to see the famous Roman sites that summer of ’87 so long ago. I was on a “Discovering Europe” group tour of around 50 people, mostly high school students and some parent-chaperones, which was arranged by my high school Spanish teacher. We had 24 days to see nine cities in four countries. Rome was a blur. I mainly remember our tour of the Colosseum, seeing where the Pope lives, and not liking the pizza.
I actually still have the travel journal I kept on that trip and dug it out of storage recently so that I could refresh my memory and maybe have a few laughs. It did not disappoint. Page after page of black cursive handwriting captured my deep teenage thoughts.
“I don’t like Rome at all. Our hotel room is right by a busy street. And just like in Paris people drive like maniacs beeping horns all the time.”
“Today sucked! We had to get up early to see the Palace of Versailles. It was a boring tour.”
“We went to a fast food place called Burger Quick. I only got a soda (6 francs) but the hamburgers I saw were gross! They were so rare!”
“In Venice we went on the most boringest walking tour ever! I was so tired I tried to sleep as I walked.”
I imagine my dusty travel journal being found a hundred years from now by my great-great-grandchildren in an attic somewhere. They would flip through the pages and marvel at the indecipherable writing. Thinking maybe it’s cuneiform or ancient Sanskrit, they take it to an antique dealer to see if it’s worth anything. Maybe even pay to have the cursive “translated” to see what profound insights were captured so painstakingly by hand. I imagine the translator gently revealing the contents to them.
“Well, she talks a lot about long bus rides, gross foreign food, and having to wake up too early for boring tours of churches and palaces. But, you know, things were hard back in the 20th century.”
I might not have had a big interest in art, culture, food, or history during that high school trip, but it did definitely awakened my curiosity about the world and gave me insight into how people in other countries lived. It even opened my mind to the world of politics a bit. In Italy, for example, I saw political graffiti, some of it anti-American, spray painted in English as our bus drove through the busy Roman streets. One night after dinner we strolled through St. Peter’s Square in Vatican City and came across a candle-holding procession of people. Our guide told us that they were protesting the Pope’s election of a man who was believed to be an ex Nazi war criminal. I filed these and other important learnings away in the back of my teenage brain since the highlight of that particular evening (according to my journal) was hanging out on the steps of a church near our hotel, listening to a portable radio and dancing around until our curfew came.
In my first Paris article, I talked about all of the funny mistakes I made on my first trips to Europe, such as washing my underwear and socks in a bidet in my Paris hotel room because I thought it was just another sink. Well, the faux pas streak continued a week later in Rome when I again used the sink to wash my shirts and shorts (a real one this time, not a bidet). I decided to hang them to dry over the railing of my partial balcony, which faced a busy Roman street. When I came back hours later, my clothes were hanging in various spots around the room, still wet. A chaperone soon told us that hanging clothes outdoors so close to the Vatican was forbidden and not to do it. My not-so-bright idea didn’t sit well with housekeeping, nor the papacy, apparently. Who knows though, I bet when no one’s looking, the Pope puts his big pointy hat on his window ledge every once in a while to air it out.
I grew up on the East Coast of the United States, so to me “old” was something that was built a few hundred years ago, not thousands like you see in Rome. My hometown of Bristol, Pennsylvania, was founded in 1681. That’s pretty old for a town in the United States, though it’s certainly not the oldest. For comparison, Philadelphia traces its roots back to 1682, New York City to 1624, and Boston to 1630. St. Augustine, Florida, has them all beat, though, having been continuously inhabited since 1565. Of course, if you head to the Southwest, you’ll find even older places that native Americans built.
One of my favorite places to eat in Bristol is the King George II Inn & Tavern, which is the oldest continuously operating inn in the country. I always thought it was cool that some of our founding fathers came through its doors, including a young George Washington, John Adams, and James Madison. Even France’s Marquis de Lafayette ate there, probably munching on an early variation of a burger and French fries (well, to him it would just be “fries,” I guess). That early fascination is probably why I tend to seek out pubs and restaurants that are considered “the oldest” in the cities I visit, and why I love to stay at historic hotels.
I remember the first time I encountered something much, much older and how it made my head spin with awe. I was working temporarily in London and took a day trip to Warwick Castle one weekend. At 23, I still wasn’t much into history, but since we did a lot of date memorizing in history classes, I remembered distinctly that in 1066 that famous William guy did his conquering thing and became King of England.
While walking around the grounds of the castle he had built, I became fixated on the dirt path I was following, imagining how he might have walked this same dusty path. I could literally be walking in William the Conqueror’s footsteps, I thought excitedly. History really came to life for me at that moment. If only teleportation were a thing, field trips for World History class would be way more interesting.
It’s even more amazing when something so old is still in use. Once when I was in Adana, Turkey, in the late ’90s, my husband and I were in a cab sitting in rush hour traffic and were amazed when the driver told us that the stone bridge we were stuck on was built by the Romans in the 2nd century. Imagine a structure surviving nearly 2,000 years intact possibly being taken down by a distracted driver on their cell phone or fumbling with the radio. I was happy to read years later that they banned cars on it in 2007, and now it’s open only to foot traffic.
The Romans sure knew how to build things to last. The Colosseum would be completely intact today if it wasn’t for earthquakes and people in the Middle Ages pillaging its stone blocks to use for other buildings. Then there’s the old Appian Way. I can’t wait to walk along what’s considered the oldest road in the world (that’s still visible). That expression — “All roads lead to Rome”? Well, this road is the mother of them all. It’s so old, some of the stones still have grooves in them from chariot wheels (and we think potholes are bad). I’m sure I’ll have a time-travel mind melt when I imagine myself walking in the footsteps of historical heavyweights such as Julius Caesar and Spartacus. Though not literally: Caesar’s feet probably never had to touch the ground, being a conquering dictator and all, and well, poor Spartacus was crucified on the old Appian Way along with thousands of other rebellious gladiators.
Starting in late May, I’ll be trying to live like a local while staying at an apartment in the Monteverde neighborhood, just south of Trastevere. It’s about an hour walk from my place to the Colosseum, so I definitely hope to be living away from the tourist crowds, especially since this is a Jubilee year for the Catholic Church, which happens only once every 25 years. There’s no metro stop on my side of the river, but there are buses, trams, and of course my two feet. I’ll need to get in as many steps as I can if I’m going to eat all of the things on my checklist.
I need to redeem my teenage self’s dislike of the one pizza experience I had in Rome, so there will be lots of pizza tasting of all shapes and sizes. I’m not really into meat toppings, so I’ll probably just do plain, but there are some interesting veggies to try on pizza like radicchio, zucchini flowers, and squash blossoms. And of course there’s the pasta. I learned that there are four classics I have to try in Rome: Gricia (ancient), Amatriciana, Carbonara, and Cacio e Pepe. I’m not sure if I’ll work up the courage to try the specialty dishes made with offal (intestines, stomach lining, etc.). Though I’m willing to try meatballs made with cow tail (oxtail) and the famous Saltimbocca alla Romana (veal). There’s also a fancy bologna-like lunchmeat called mortadella that looks interesting.
I’ll also of course make time to do some sightseeing when I’m not working. So much time has passed since my last visit to Rome there’s even been a new exciting discovery. In my teenage travel journal, I wrote that I had visited the Forum ruins where our tour guide Ned told us Julius Caesar was assassinated. But turns out that was wrong. Excavations in 2012 uncovered markings by Caesar’s successor Augustus where he designated the exact spot. Turns out, it happened in the Curia di Pompey, a meeting place within the Pompey Theater complex that the Senators were using while the Senate House was being renovated. In 2023 a raised walkway was built over the excavation site so that visitors could get a closer look.
I’m sure I’ll have many moments where I try to imagine myself living among the ancient Romans. Like Russell Crowe’s character Maximus did in the Gladiator movie, I like to run my hands along tall grasses and plant leaves within my reach. It’s something I do no matter where I am walking, but in a place with lots of history, it helps me to feel connected to the people who were there centuries before me. It’s the same with touching walls, trees, and stones (when it’s allowed). Though my hands won’t be going anywhere near the stone latrine seats of the ancient communal bathrooms that I hope to see when touring the nearby ruins of Ostia Antica. I don’t need to imagine that part of ancient Roman life.
I am, however, open to the idea of using a bidet. In a kind of weird, come-full-circle plot twist, the apartment I’m renting has a bathroom with a bidet right next to the toilet. The place does have a washer and dryer, so don’t worry — my underwear and socks will be properly laundered this time.
Eventually, I plan to document here on Medium how it all went. Until then, follow my stories and posts on Instagram (@pammypez).

In the annals of Roman history, certain names echo with legendary resonance: Caesar, Augustus, Nero. Yet, there are emperors whose legacies, though significant, shimmer less vividly in the collective memory. Among these, Lucius Verus (130–169 AD) stands as a compelling figure, whose reign alongside Marcus Aurelius marked a period of both prosperity and profound challenges for the Roman Empire.
The Path to Power
Lucius Verus’ path to the imperial throne was both unique and a reflection of the complex adoption practices among Roman elites. Born Lucius Ceionius Commodus, his rise to prominence came through a series of strategic adoptions orchestrated by Hadrian to ensure a smooth succession. Hadrian first adopted Antoninus Pius on the condition that Antoninus would subsequently adopt both Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Ceionius Commodus (the future Lucius Verus). This series of adoptions was aimed at securing a stable and capable line of succession.
Upon Hadrian’s death, Antoninus Pius became emperor, and Lucius Verus, alongside Marcus Aurelius, was groomed for future leadership. The true moment of Lucius Verus’ accession began when Antoninus Pius died in 161 AD. In a historic move, Marcus Aurelius, immediately upon becoming emperor, insisted on sharing power with Lucius Verus, thereby elevating him to the status of co-emperor. This decision was groundbreaking, marking the first time in Roman history that the empire was officially ruled by two emperors simultaneously. The co-emperorship was a testament to their close relationship and Marcus Aurelius’ desire for a balanced and shared rule.
Military Endeavors
Lucius Verus’ reign was significantly shaped by his military campaigns, particularly in the East. The Parthian War (161–166 AD) stands out as the most notable. Initially, Verus was criticized for his seemingly luxurious lifestyle in Antioch, away from the front lines. However, under his nominal command, Roman forces, led by capable generals such as Avidius Cassius, achieved significant victories, including the capture of the Parthian capital, Ctesiphon, in 165 AD. These successes expanded Roman influence in the East and brought substantial booty back to Rome, but they also inadvertently introduced a devastating plague that would afflict the empire for years.
Coinage and Public Image
The coinage of Lucius Verus, like that of many Roman emperors, served as a vital tool for propaganda and the projection of imperial authority. His coins frequently depicted themes of victory and divine favor, reinforcing his and Marcus Aurelius’ status as protectors and benefactors of the empire. The imagery on these coins, ranging from representations of conquered territories to symbols of military success, played a crucial role in shaping public perception of his reign.
Architectural Contributions and Public Works
Although Lucius Verus’ rule is less noted for monumental architecture than that of his co-emperor Marcus Aurelius, his contributions to Rome’s urban landscape were not insignificant. He and Marcus Aurelius jointly dedicated the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, transforming a personal monument into a public space of worship. Additionally, the triumphal arches and other structures erected in their honor celebrated their military victories and served as enduring symbols of their joint rule.
Personal Life and Legacy
Verus’ personal life, marked by his marriage to Marcus Aurelius’ daughter Lucilla, was integral to the political and familial alliances that underpinned the stability of their co-emperorship. His untimely death in 169 AD, possibly due to the plague that followed the Parthian campaign, brought an end to this unique period of dual rule. In the aftermath, Marcus Aurelius continued to govern alone, facing further military and social challenges without the partnership that had characterized their approach to leadership.
Lucius Verus’ reign, though overshadowed by that of his more philosophically inclined co-emperor, was a pivotal period in the history of the Roman Empire. His military successes bolstered Rome’s territorial and strategic standing, while his coinage and public works projects contributed to the civic and cultural life of the empire. Despite the brevity of his rule and the challenges that marred it, Verus’ legacy is a testament to the complexities and contradictions of imperial leadership in ancient Rome.
Conclusion
Lucius Verus, often overlooked in the shadow of Marcus Aurelius, was a figure of considerable importance in the Roman imperial pantheon. His unique position as co-emperor, his military accomplishments, and his role in the cultural and economic life of the empire offer valuable insights into the dynamics of Roman imperial rule and the challenges it faced. As we reflect on his legacy, we are reminded of the myriad ways in which power, politics, and personal ambition intersect in the annals of history, shaping the destinies of empires and their rulers.

Since the election in America, I have had to take a few somewhat drastic steps to maintain my sanity, and they began with divorcing myself from any and all news, primarily anything related to politics. Someone else I know called it Ostrich Mode, but I prefer to think of it as Turtle Mode. A complete withdrawal from most of society. Knowing how impulsive I can sometimes be, it’s hard to believe this will be a long-term thing, but you never know.
Therefore, out of fairness to all our writers, I am suspending the acceptance of any new writing at this time. I don’t want to ignore those trying to publish and I realize I risk permanently losing both readers and writers, but my only alternative is to either ignore the publication altogether, or delete it. I would prefer not deleting it at this time. The publication will remain live. I just won’t be accepting any new stories for the time being. I thank you for your understanding, and good luck.
If and when I regain some equilibrium, I’ll let you know and we’ll get back to business.

Bam, here we are, back in his apartment close to Altitude 100, where the chicken drawing has been set straight. The place is clean, relatively orderly now and C. is cooking a gourmet dinner for us. He is French, you can’t teach much more to a French guy who knows how to cook. You mostly sit down and enjoy the food he is making and the show of him making it. The ingredients come out of brown paper wrappings, not from plastic bags. The man loves to show his skill. Nevertheless, he burns a couple of the dishes, possibly stage fright? That’s OK, I think I’m getting used to his way of self-sabotaging his best intentions. So we sit down and eat some very sophisticated, yet burned entrées, under the modernistic chicken gaze.
There is no male gaze anywhere that I can see here, but there is this chicken looking down on us. This brings an offbeat touch to things. I feel safe with him, he is generous and open. His engaged leftism makes me look centrist at best, in many topics and it makes me reconsider some of my positions. He is softly teasing me about working for a big nasty corporation, in marketing of all things. While he is the gauchist journalist investigating big…

Every successful school of thought, religion and system that has endured the test of time has one common precept: When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
It means that if your idea is universal enough to offer food for thought and even some enlightening properties, your approach must be adaptable to changing circumstances, cultures and norms. But with one catch: the core teaching must remain universal and comprehensive — intact.
The saying I quoted earlier comes from the 4th century Bishop of Milan, St Ambrose. He was a theologian and statesman with solid leadership, profoundly shaping early Christian theology and doctrine.
Ambrose was what we call an inspirational speaker. He could wow the audience but didn’t let popularity blur his views. He didn’t let anything dilute his faith and was fierce against heresy. The saying attributed to him tells us about a person who is pragmatic yet has strong integrity.

Migrants poured over the southern border. Many came for jobs after employment options in their home regions had dried up; others were attracted to the excitement and glamour of their destination. Soon the influx began to worry leading politicians, who authorized a series of enforcement actions against select categories of immigrants. Deportations, they believed, would put an end to the mess. No luck: undeterred, the immigrants kept coming.
At last, one politician ventured a proposal. Why not extend the citizenship? Not to all non-citizens, of course — just to one specific, carefully circumscribed subset. But one party was having none of it: “if you give them citizenship,” the party’s spokesman insisted, “you assume (I think) that you’ll still have the same political rights and worship in the same way as you do now. But don’t you realize that those people will take over everything?” The proposal withered on the vine.
The speaker of these lines was Gaius Fannius, consul in 122 BCE and a dogged opponent of Gaius Gracchus’ proposal to extend the citizenship to Rome’s Latin allies. For all its celebrated inclusivity, ancient Rome had residents and leaders who were none too pleased about the continuous stream of immigrants: Fannius’ warning is a distant echo of Donald Trump’s “we either have a country or we don’t have a country.” Romans were as willing as many Americans are today to give this displeasure political and legal expression.
But why undertake this rewriting of late republican Rome in the first place? Partly because in doing so I join a modern conversation about immigration that — in both Europe and America — regularly and explicitly adduces parallels from the ancient world as justification for various kinds of immigration policy. In this article, I’ll examine the sentimental and rhetorical configurations through which ancient Rome (and Greece) are put to work in contemporary discussions of immigration and outline how Romans themselves perceived and responded to immigration during the Republic and Empire. In a second, follow-up article, I’ll explore how mobility in the ancient Mediterranean structurally mirrored 21st-century migration towards Europe and the United States. Ancient history can clarify how we think about recent developments, just not in the way(s) normally assumed.
Let me stress that my own perspective as a formerly undocumented immigrant with emphatically pro-migrant political commitments informs what and how I write. No Tacitean disavowal of bias for me. But I hope that even those who do not share my views on immigration will consider how antiquity can be repurposed in modern conversations about immigration.
Writing in the pages of The Wall Street Journal, Cambridge classicist Mary Beard recently asserted that the Romans “would have been puzzled by today’s hostility to migrants.” Well before the publication of the op-ed, Beard made use of her status as one of Britain’s foremost public intellectuals to offer a liberal perspective — sometimes greeted with viciously misogynistic hostility — on contemporary migrant and refugee matters.
The tradition of roping the ancient world into assessments of modern immigration has been a fixture of British political and cultural discourses for quite some time: Enoch Powell’s infamous 1968 “Rivers of Blood” speech (complete with Vergilian allusion) standing at one end of the political spectrum, with Boris Johnson’s 2006 Dream of Rome closer to the other. As Mayor of London, Johnson has continued beating the classical drum, issuing warnings that Britain will turn into the ancient state least like Rome in its treatment of foreigners — Sparta — should it adhere to plans to reduce its net migration.
On the other side of the Atlantic, another professional classicist has intervened in the immigration debates: Victor Davis Hanson. Not one to be deterred by the prospect of controversy, Hanson waded into the immigration-policy waters with his 2003 hybrid-genre book Mexifornia. After first observing that “America is what Rome once was to hustling Jews, Greeks and Numidians” (p. 51), Hanson goes on to claim in his epilogue that the “freedom and material dynamism of the West are drawing millions to its shores — in the manner that Athens once attracted metics from Asia, and Rome drew Africans, Jews and Armenians” (p. 142). (And as proof that classicists holding forth on immigration can irritate members of the political establishment, one need look no further than Hanson: after introducing himself as a “classicist” at a Capitol Hill briefing the year of his book’s publication, Hanson was reportedly accosted by a Congressional staffer who thought he had heard Hanson term himself a “classist”; the face-off ended with the staffer exiting the briefing in anger.)
Comparisons of modern America to ancient Rome are, of course, nothing new, and so hackneyed by now as to inspire a book-length rebuttal. But in recent decades many of these comparisons have been fueled by anxieties about immigration, particularly of the illegal/undocumented variety. Actress and conservative politician Clare Boothe Luce expressed concern in a 1982 Washington Post interview that the United States might be headed “for the fate of ancient Rome … a city of pollution and noise and foreigners, [that] collapsed under the weight of the barbarians.”
Since 9/11, the argument that a lax immigration policy will hasten the United States’ Rome-like demise has steadily gained traction. A 2004 Florida Times-Union editorial on “illegal immigration and the problems that go with it” ended on this ominous note: “ancient Rome couldn’t, or wouldn’t, stop the influx of barbarians across its border.” Taking to The Washington Post in 2007 to outline a “tolerant but also tough” vision for US immigration policy, Yale Law School professor Amy Chua reminded her readers that the “greatest empire in history, ancient Rome, collapsed when its cultural and political glue dissolved … [i]n part, this fragmentation occurred because of a massive influx of immigrants from a very different culture.” Three years later, Stevens Institute of Technology professor Silvio Laccetti argued that Rome’s extension of its citizenship through the Edict of Caracalla had precipitated an “erosion of civic pride and responsibility” in the course of outlining his own proposal of a tolerant but tough immigration scheme. And in undoubtedly the most entertaining riff on the Rome conceit, Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) went full Cicero on the Senate floor — framing Obama as Catiline — following the President’s November 2014 announcement of an executive order deferring the deportation of undocumented parents of American citizens and permanent residents.
You wouldn’t be wrong to suspect that the genealogy I’ve charted so far has an even deeper history: the practice of invoking the Roman Republic and Empire’s treatment of immigrants as paradigmatic and/or cautionary is already on display in the state- and nation-building discourses of the early modern period. Edward Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire reserves the purplest of its purple prose for the barbarians at the gate and the Fifth Column of immigrant slaves and domestics waiting to welcome them. (Last year, a lengthy rumination — sprinkled with block quotations from Decline and Fall — on Gibbon’s continuing relevance was posted to breitbart.com under the pseudonym “Virgil” and triggered over 1400 comments, mostly effusions of agreement.) Before Gibbon, Montesquieu had sketched the contribution of foreigners and barbarians to Rome’s imperial dissolution in chapter 16 of his Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline.
But well before either, Machiavelli had taken a somewhat different line on immigration in Discourses on Livy, praising Rome’s openness to foreigners as integral to the amassing of the military and economic power through which the republic set itself apart from Athens and Sparta (II.3). Machiavelli wasn’t just anticipating Boris Johnson’s evaluation of Roman greatness as a consequence of open migration. Diligent reader of Livy that he was, Machiavelli was putting his finger on a line of argument that reached back to the ancients themselves.
The history of rhetorically positioning Rome’s treatment of immigrants really begins in antiquity, with both Greeks and Romans chiming in on the fluctuating — and at times very divergent — trends in the Republic and Empire’s openness. Having worked our way backwards in time to the ancients, we should now pause and ask: how open were Romans to foreigners, really? It turns out that Romans were far more ambivalent about immigration than some moderns give them credit for.
In the first decade of the war with Hannibal, a Macedonian king turned Roman adversary praised the Republic’s free and easy bestowal of citizenship in a letter exchange with a Greek city-state. In a world where city-states could be quite stingy with grants of citizenship — especially Sparta, notorious for its deportations — Rome had so succeeded in marketing itself as exceptional that even an enemy felt compelled to take notice. This marketing took several forms, and the one that has left the most durable imprint on literary and non-literary sources alike is Rome’s origin myth.
In contrast to the Greek city-states whose origin stories indulged the fantasy of autochthony (according to which a community and its members sprang up from the earth in the place they inhabited), Rome promoted itself as the product of immigrants. Molded during the turbulent centuries of Italian and Mediterranean expansion, Rome’s legendary history began with an illegal immigrant: pious Aeneas, fleeing with his family and friends from the devastation of Troy household gods in hand, elderly father on his back, young son by his side.
As canonized in the Aeneid, the challenges faced by the founder of the Roman race include some of the traditional (epic) dilemmas of travel — where to go and how long to stay, whose hospitality to accept and whose to decline — Homeric effects translated for a Roman audience. And once Aeneas and his band do arrive on Italian shores, they are denied the happily-ever-after outcome. Their lot is to contend with belligerence, grief, early death.
Some months ago, Michael Fontaine proposed in this publication a reading of the Aeneid’s second half that aligns rather felicitously with contemporary geopolitical events. On one level, the Aeneas myth internalizes the plight of immigrants/refugees (fato profugi); at the same time, it gives form to the mirror anxiety of those native residents who from the first encounter feel that the new arrivals will take their land and resources and women.
Spinning out this thread further, I’d add that the ambivalence towards refugees and immigrants woven into the Aeneas legend reflects centuries of unease at Rome about the presence and role of foreigners. The unease was embodied in the mythic personas of Aeneas, Romulus, and Remus, all three of whom were remembered as thieves, rapists, and murderers. Here comparison with the modern myth of the immigrant as criminal is instructive. Earlier this year, to thumps and cheers, Trump laid out his campaign platform on immigration:
“The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems…When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best…They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us [sic]. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”
Trump and his partisans seem to have a complementary myth at hand: the “Ellis Island” arrivals of virtuous character and exemplary work ethic (unlike today’s purveyors of drugs and crime). Much the same conflict between these two alternate ideals of the immigrant played out in ancient Rome. As Rome expanded, nativist and xenophobic discourses proliferated, with consequences for the waves of immigrants settling down in Rome in the last centuries of the Republic and first few centuries of the Empire.
These discourses had sharp legal teeth. On top of the targeted removals and expulsions of groups identified as religiously and/or philosophical suspect — the Bacchants in 186 BCE, philosophers in 161 and 154, Chaldaeans and Jews in 139 — immigrants hailing from communities elsewhere in Italy were deported on multiple occasions in the years 187–172 (citations and discussion: Noy, Foreigners at Rome, pp. 37–47). Sometime in the 120s, a law was passed expelling all foreigners from the city of Rome; another version of the law was passed in 65 BCE. Thanks to the Severan-era historian Cassius Dio, we know something of the reasons for the second law’s passage (37.9): not only were foreigners believed to be too numerous, it was worried that they weren’t suitable enough (epitedeioi) to live alongside Romans.
It’s worth remembering that throughout this entire time Rome still had a republican system of government. These laws were ratified by popular will and not autocratic imposition. Since foreigners couldn’t necessarily be identified on sight (any romano di Roma stood a decent chance of being physically indistinguishable from an immigrant), it is anyone’s guess how these laws were enforced. The association of specific neighborhoods with certain groups of immigrants may have played a role in the orchestration of round-ups.
We do know that one Roman witness to the law of 65 did not like what he saw. Characterizing this law and its predecessor from the 120s as designed not only to deny foreigners access to Rome but to deport those already living there (eosque exterminant), Cicero declares in the De officiis that “denying foreigners access to our city is patently inhumane” (3.11.47). Although he managed to successfully defend the poet Aulus Licinius Archias from deportation, Cicero laments in a letter to his friend Atticus that the same law had been deployed, out of spite, to condemn (and presumably deport) a freedman assistant to the politician and former consul Aulus Gabinius after Gabinius beat charges of political corruption.
Neither the moral nor rhetorical authority of Cicero could halt the policing and deportation of certain categories of immigrants; the practice persisted well into the Empire. Yet immigrants kept on coming. The satirist Juvenal’s bombastic xenophobe Umbricius couldn’t abide their presence: “Romans, I can’t tolerate the city being Greek. Yet what portion of the shit is really Greek? For a long time now the Syrian Orontes has poured into the Tiber…” (Sat. 3.58–60). But for the Greek-speaking author of The Learned Banqueters, it was precisely Rome’s embrace of different immigrant populations that enhanced its glory: it was a heavenly city, encompassing so many foreign populations as to defy enumeration (Deipn. 1.20b-c).
We should be careful to respect the differences between ancient Rome and the modern US (or Europe). For example, the preoccupation with “border enforcement” wasn’t quite as intense among the Romans — though perhaps the time has come to read Augustus’ reported advice to Tiberius to “keep the empire’s borders secure” (my consciously tendentious rendering of Tacitus’ enigmatic coercendi intra terminos imperii) and/or Aelius Aristides’ praise of the Empire’s walls in his Roman Oration as implicated in a kind of border politics. And at no point in its trajectory from Republic or Empire was Rome a nation in the modern sense.
But with these caveats out of the way, I want to underline a few fundamental similarities between the immigration sensibilities of ancient Rome and those of 21st-century America. Then as now, foundation myths about the state as the creation of immigrants articulated and projected deeply felt anxieties about the legacy of past immigrants and the presence of current ones. Then as now, some of those anxieties were worked out through legal-administrative means, with deportation privileged as a technology of control. Then as now, foreigners stood to lose the most in confrontations between political elites — think back to Gabinius’ freedman. Then as now, the immigrant influx could inspire despair over the country going to rot or euphoria at its cosmopolitan inclusivity. Then as now, immigrants were vulnerable to hate crimes.
Hate crimes, you say?
Earlier this year, “Death to Islam” was spray-painted on the wall of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Heritage Association center in Spokane, Washington. Thousands of hate crimes are reported in the United States each year. These figures — dismayingly consistent from year to year — probably underrepresent the true number of hate crimes perpetrated. Setting aside for now the reliability of the FBI statistics, I want to concentrate on the graffito as medium for xenophobia. Even for the spray-painter, there is ancient precedent.
At some point during the second century CE, a tombstone was set up in Rome under the supervision of a certain Charitonius Mercurius for a deceased cavalry officer. From the tombstone we learn that the officer — whose name is not preserved in what remains of the inscription — was of Arabian extraction (natione Arabus); he’d lived to the age of 35, soldiering for 16 of those years and attaining the rank of eques singularis along the way. Many examples of this type of inscription survive, but in this case the real kicker comes in the form of a Greek graffito left behind by someone, possibly a fellow cavalry officer, that reads: Θ. Ἄραπσι (“Death to the Arabs!”).
The cultural and linguistic complexities of xenophobic resentment in Imperial Rome were such that a Greek-speaking resident of Rome could scrawl an ethnic taunt on a monument to a Latin-speaking native of the Near East. Romans were quite skilled at the use of graffiti to mock the immigrant Other: the late second/early third-century CE graffito from the Palatine featuring a donkey on a crucifix and the tag (again in Greek) “Alexamenos worships God” may be the earliest example of such visual denigration being applied to Greek-speaking Christians residing in Rome — and takes us back to the anxiety voiced by Gaius Fannius that immigrants would menace religious practices at home.
But my interest in summoning up the ghost of the graffito artist who marked up the tombstone has to do with the fantasy of violence folded into the tag. The cavalry officer was already dead, else he might have had a thing or two to say to the violator of his memorial. Alive and far more vulnerable was the homeless Mexican man recently beaten by two Boston men, one of whom claimed as his inspiration Donald Trump’s call to deport the undocumented.
Trump’s rhetoric justifies the commission of acts of violence against immigrants by characterizing them as inherently violent. On the stump, he has bemoaned the scourge of rapists, murderers and thieves originating not only in Mexico but “coming from all over South and Latin America and … coming probably, probably, from the Middle East.” It doesn’t seem to register among his fans that the “problem” of immigrant crime is a fiction: multiple studies carried out over the past century have repeatedly confirmed that immigrants commit crime at lower rates than the general population. What does register is the fear-mongering, especially among those already inclined to believe that white Americans are endangered: in July a petition was posted to WhiteHouse.gov asking President Obama to honor Trump “for opposing white genocide.”
Once the immigrant is construed as an existential threat, xenophobic sentiment rallies around the idea of removing that threat by any and all means necessary. Both in ancient Rome and in modern America, the fear of immigrants activates not only the desire to remove their bodies from sight through deportation, but to deprive them of life — to destroy them.

December 1, 2024First Sunday of Advent, Year CSt. Stephen’s UMC, Burke, VARomans 8:18–25 (NRSVUE)**A Sermon Series on Fuquay’s The Way to Bethlehem
For this season of Advent — a time of anticipation and preparation for the coming Christ — we will base our sermon series on Rob Fuquay’s book titled On the Way to Bethlehem: An Advent Study.
Throughout this series, we will visit four key places, starting with Rome, then moving to Jerusalem and Nazareth, and finally arriving in Bethlehem. My prayer is that as we embark on this journey together, the Spirit will guide us closer to the humble manger in Bethlehem, where we encounter Love Incarnate — God-with-us — the one named Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, and Prince of Peace.
You may wonder why we start with Rome. All the other locations seem straightforward. The Gospel of Luke begins in Jerusalem, where the angel announced Elizabeth’s pregnancy to Zechariah who was serving in the temple. Then it moves to Nazareth, where the same angel announced the pregnancy news to Elizabeth’s much younger cousin, Mary. Afterward, Mary and Joseph had to travel to Bethlehem, where Jesus was ultimately born.
So, why does this Advent journey start in Ancient Rome?
Just like how people consider Washington D.C. as a focal point of America’s power and influence, Rome symbolizes the power and influence that makes up its empire which stretched vastly across Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, including the regions of Judea where much of the New Testament narrative takes place.
This Roman Empire is often regarded as one of the most successful civilizations in human history. During the period of the Pax Romana, which means “Roman Peace” in Latin, the empire experienced centralized governance, economic prosperity, cultural flourishing, and relative stability — all the things we, humans, across time, hope for in their governments.
A key factor contributing to the period of the Pax Romana was the infrastructure developed under the reign of Caesar Augustus. During his forty-year rule, Augustus oversaw the construction of approximately fifty thousand miles of highways, creating an extensive network of roads that facilitated travel and communication. This network boosted trade, streamlined administration, and enabled the spread of ideas across the empire. Additionally, these roads allowed Roman legions to move swiftly, ensuring rapid responses to uprisings and external threats, thereby solidifying Rome’s control over its vast and diverse territories.
While the Pax Romana brought unprecedented peace and prosperity to Roman citizens, it came at a steep cost for many, particularly noncitizens and marginalized groups. High taxes were levied to sustain Rome’s massive military and ambitious infrastructure projects, disproportionately burdening conquered peoples and lower classes. Enslavement was widespread, with millions of individuals from conquered territories forced into servitude to fuel the empire’s economy and labor needs. Noncitizens lacked the legal protections and privileges of Roman citizens and were frequently exploited or oppressed under imperial rule. For many, the Pax Romana was not a time of peace but one of subjugation, inequality, and suffering under the heavy hand of empire.
Mary and Joseph were among those living under Roman occupation as Jews, part of the conquered peoples and noncitizens of the empire. And their journey to Bethlehem was not one of choice but of obligation, prompted by a decree from Caesar Augustus, calling for a census. And this census was a common tool of an empire, often used to increase tax revenues to support its vast ambitions.
So, imagine how these conquered people, including Mary and Joseph, felt as they trudged toward Bethlehem. There might have been a sense of helplessness as they complied with orders, knowing they had no choice. Perhaps there was skepticism and fear, wondering what new demands or hardships might further complicate their already difficult lives. Perhaps they felt resignation and complacency, accepting their reality that the only way to survive was to serve the empire without resistance. Or maybe they felt the weight of defeat and hopelessness, quietly echoing the psalmist’s cry: “How long, O Lord?” (Psalm 13).
Although we are no conquered people, perhaps we can relate to them in some way — especially to the feeling of helplessness before the forces that shape our lives. On a systemic level, we recognize policies and systems beyond our control that bring harm, prioritize profit over people, and perpetuate inequality or suffering, impacting countless lives, especially those who are marginalized and voiceless. On a personal level, we acknowledge forces that harm us and leave us feeling defeated, despite our deep longing for change — whether it be chronic illness, long-term addiction, destructive habits, abusive relationships, or loneliness. Scripture calls these forces, which operate on personal, systemic, and cosmic levels, “principalities and powers” (Eph 6:12). These forces can feel like chains of bondage and captivity, leaving us yearning for liberation and longing for a hope that can break through and set us free. This is the very starting point of our journey: Rome represents the seat of these principalities and powers, a place where “our hopes and fears are released and sometimes collide.” Thus, Advent begins with longing — longing for change, longing for freedom, longing for justice, longing for peace, longing for deliverance, longing for salvation, longing for the Savior.
Out of Israel’s longing for a Savior, Jesus Christ was born.
But that is only half of the Advent story.
The other half of the story is
that out of our longing for a Savior, Jesus Christ will come again.
Isn’t that the mystery of faith we proclaim?
Christ has died; Christ is risen; Christ will come again.
So, let me ask you:
The Apostle Paul speaks to our experience of longing in today’s scripture, written to the house churches in Rome who were expecting Jesus’ return within their lifetime. Their waiting for the coming of Christ met with the harsh reality of suffering. As you know, they were the church in Rome, the very seat of principalities and powers. Once again, in the midst of suffering, they longed for change, redemption, and restoration; they groaned for their Savior.
Paul writes to their experience, emphasizing that it is not just they but the whole creation that groans together for salvation, as if enduring the pains of labor. In other words, their shared suffering is not the end — it is a hopeful anticipation of new birth and new life. Although all they could see and feel now is indescribable pain, Paul encourages them to wait in eager longing and hope, for a wonderful gift of future glory is on the way.
And this expectant groaning of labor pains still applies to us today. We continue to wait in hopeful anticipation for new birth and new life, even in the face of the present sufferings in our world, which we experience and for which we intercede. And we remain hopeful because of the first fruits of the Spirit: the glimpses of God’s kingdom, the moments when the Holy Spirit moves among us, and the gifts of grace we witness every day through Christ. In other words, we remain hopeful because our God intercedes for us in our collective suffering.
Consider the glimpses of God’s kingdom, the moments when the Holy Spirit has moved among us, or the gifts of grace we have witnessed. These phrases often describe experiences that exceed our expectations and understandings. These capture divine surprises that defy our skepticism and cynicism. These embody the extraordinary love we receive from those who reflect Christ. These first-fruit experiences are what keep us hopeful in our suffering. And our state of hopefulness in labor pain produces in us not only trust and firmness in the faith, but also a different way of living. Through our words and actions, we reveal an alternative way of being in the world through sharing the gifts of the Spirit with those around us.
Again, I find Paul’s metaphor of labor pain brilliant. I remember being in a delivery room for almost twenty-four hours, being next to my wife as she endured intense pain and extreme fatigue. And we were there pushing for this baby to come out in hopeful anticipation, without any idea of what this baby would become, what gifts she would bring to our family, or how her presence would alter our lives.
As Paul writes in today’s scripture, hope that is seen is not hope, but we hope for what we do not see. And we do so with endurance, steadfastness, and perseverance — which are what the translated word patience tries to convey. I think this is both the most beautiful and frustrating part of our Christian journey: we do not hope for what is seen but for what we do not see. Our hope lies not in absolute certainty but in humble mystery. Our hope flourishes not in human preference but in divine imagination.
This is the very movement of our faith journey, revealed through the story of Advent. Out of Israel’s longing for a Savior, Jesus Christ was born in the most unexpected way possible — in a lowly manger as a helpless baby. Out of Creation’s longing for a Savior, Jesus brought salvation to us in the most unexpected way possible — through death on a cross and resurrection. Out of our longing for a Savior, Jesus has and will continue to reveal himself to us in unexpected ways. And out of the whole Creation’s longing for a Savior, we believe Jesus Christ will come again in the most unexpected way possible.
Dear church, let me ask you these questions once again:
Whenever we think about these things, we often wish — perhaps most of the time — that God would just act like a human empire, issuing decrees to put a swift end to our misery and all human sufferings. We wish God would just tell us imperatively what to do so we no longer have to deal with all these problems.
But, as the book On the Way to Bethlehem beautifully describes,¹
God does not decree. Rater, God births. God sends a baby, a Son. A Son who would be killed by the empire under which he was born, suffering a Roman crucifixion. Why? So that something new could be birthed in our hearts. Whatever change needs to happen in our world begins with our being born again. For what does creation wait for with eager longing? “For the revealing of the children of God.” [That’s] us, born again.
Despite how much we might wish the church could operate like an empire, the church is called to be more like a harvest field — patiently spreading the seeds of God’s kingdom in all soils, with hope that those seeds will sprout and grow in our hearts. Only then can we be born again, yielding a harvest of fruits to be shared with the world.
As we begin this Advent season, I pray that seeds of divine imagination take root in our hearts. May the story of Christmas be more than an occasion to revisit an old tale. May it become an invitation to leave behind our “Rome” with hopeful anticipation. As we draw closer to O little town of Bethlehem, may Christ be born anew in our hearts, and may we, too, be renewed and born again in Christ.
In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

What to read before your Italian adventure!
There can’t be a definitive list of books to read before going travelling to a glorious new destination, but I tried to find and read as many recommendations as I could before my trip to Florence and Rome, and here are the books that I found most enjoyable and interesting.
My top choice funnily enough, was from a series of books called Horrible Histories that I read when I was younger, and found that it had the most comprehensive whistle-stop tour of ancient Rome presented in an entertaining manner for a busy but curious traveller.
The Ruthless Romans is full of jokes, anecdotes, and important historical figures. It covers Ancient Rome from 1000 BC - 476 AD and is shockingly dense and informative for such an easy read. If you don’t have any time at all, try reading this on the plane to da Vinci airport.
Between the collapse of the Republic and start of the Roman Empire is a key piece that I read in high school: Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare. I don’t think you need to read Shakespeare before a trip, but if you like me have fond memories of sitting in class mesmerized by a political conflict written four centuries ago about a historical event from a couple of millennia ago, then you’ll remember the irony that in killing Caesar for his assumed monarchic intent, the Senate all but ensured that “another Caesar” would eventually take over Rome as its first emperor: Augustus.
To go off on another minor nostalgic tangent, if Shakespeare is too much of a commitment before a trip to Rome, Asterix hilariously covers the Roman campaigns that lead to the events in Julius Caesar.
For some real, serious history, these two were the most recommended:
Unfortunately I only managed to dip my toes in them before my trip and they were very dense and informative.
On a lighter note, I did breeze through Angels and Demons. It was an action-packed thriller that plays fast and loose with facts.
I liked that it covered Vatican City, which none of the previous books do, and touched on the works of Botticelli and Dante, who were both all over especially Florence and Rome.
For Florence, I’ve been reading The Enchantress of Florence that does an incredible job setting the stage for what the world was like in the 16th century and how interconnected Italy, Turkey, India and everything in between were by trade links and travellers.
Some other books by Italian authors and set in Italy that I didn’t have a chance to read but would like to in the future are:
And to throw it in there because it was everywhere, especially in Florence where Dante’s bones aren’t: The Divine Comedy.

The plan was to end the day at the Villa Borghese gardens, but with twenty more minutes of walking and legs already exhausted from a full day on foot, it didn’t seem worth it.
Instead, I stopped on a pedestrian terrace along the busy Via Frattina, not far from my hotel.
A glass of red wine, a seat outside, and a bit of people-watching paired with a book. It’s a great exercise to avoid reaching for your phone when you’re sitting alone.
The café held me for about half an hour, soaking in the buzz of the street and the taste of the wine.
Once the last sip of Italian red was gone, I headed back to the Bulgari hotel to get my power bank. Yes, I was staying at the Bulgari hotel, and no, I can’t afford it. That’s a story for another time.
As I approach the reception, five people in uniform turn to face me.
I ask if I can grab something from my bags, which were stored in the luggage room, and a beautiful young man smiles at me, “Of course. Follow me.”
We walk into the room, and he leads me to my things.
“Oh, so you don’t need this. You know which ones they are.” I say quietly, as I glance down…

Non-members of Medium can read the full article here.
I first visited Rome with my family a few years back. We were planning to do the main touristy things, but when faced with the endless queue in St Peter’s Square, we had a change of plan and a wander down to the river instead.
I’d not done much research for the trip, unusual for me, but I wasn’t organising it — my role was just to turn up and enjoy! So I had no idea what other attractions were within walking distance. But we were pretty sure there would be a cafe where we could sit and watch the world go by fairly close by.
We walked past the street sellers, their souvenirs spread out on tarpaulins, and approached the river. My attention was drawn to the building on my left, first the light stone walls, then the darker brick of the heart of the castle, and I was hit by the strangest feeling of déjà vu. I knew this building, it’s curved ramparts, the flagpole on top. But this was my first trip to Rome. Why was a place I’d never been to so familiar?

Rome might be it for me. The one. The city above all others. The one you find yourself Googling flights to late at night, even when you’ve just arrived home from your last trip.
I think we all have places like that.
A few months ago, I visited Rome for the fourth time. One of those times was a month-long trip and I can tell you, it was one of the highlights of my three-year-long travels. I never wanted to leave because Rome has exactly what I love in a city. Beauty. Atmosphere. And one of my favourite food and drink cultures in the world.
Yes, there are tourist traps. Yes, some places will give you a raw deal in bad pasta, bad pizza and bad wine. But there is also value to be found. You can find pizza that will do things to you. You can eat pasta that will ruin every other pasta you eat henceforth (it’s that good).
If you want to eat and drink well in this city, you’ve just got to know where to go.
Every day in Rome starts with a caffè and a maritozzo — Rome’s famous cream-filled…

LE CITOYEN — Ancient Rome is undoubtedly a civilisation to be looked upon. Albeit known for their ‘pagan extravagance,’ the ancient Romans did, however, conquer and create a nation state that ranged from the borders of Scotland to the deserts of Arabia, reaching its height in the 2nd century CE and influence modern western life more than any other ancient civilisation (alongside the Greeks). However, there are only a few good examples of films and TV series that depict Roman life as it should. Films such as Gladiator, despite its well-written plot, presented a lot of inaccuracies. Meanwhile, TV-series such as Spartacus were, well, rather vulgar — not saying that Roman society wasn’t like that — but for a historical TV show, it showed parts of Roman culture that should have been, let’s say, set behind curtains and exaggerated at that! However, one TV series has put me, as an avid enthusiast of all things Greco-Roman, to stop my various nitpicks and just sit down and enjoy. With an unbelievably stellar plot and deep research into Roman life, the HBO Series Rome (first launched in 2006), terribly underrated in comparison to the likes of Game of Thrones, is what I could say (and most historians do agree) a highly-authentic depiction of Roman life.
Albeit historians having pointed out a few inaccuracies (especially in the timeline), what HBO’s Rome brought was much better: authenticity. It immersed yourself into the world, made you care about the characters, and anxiously sit on your chair as you watch the series go on, waiting for what other secrets of Ancient Rome might be uncovered.
Overview
Over two seasons, the TV miniseries Rome follows Lucius Vorenus (played by Kevin McKidd) and Titus Pullo (played by Ray Stevenson), two soldiers of the Roman legion and therefore Roman citizens, as they go through turbulent times in Roman history. Vorenus and Pullo are both members of the plebeian class–or the common citizenry–of Rome back in the dying days of the Republic and so gives us a lot of new perspectives on ancient Roman life. While also following the high politics of Gaius Julius Caesar (played by Ciaran Hinds, who later featured in Game of Thrones as the wildling King, Mance Rayder), and his civil wars against Pompey, which is already a recurring theme as depicted by popular media, such as multiple films on the life of Caesar and most well-known the plays written by one William Shakespeare, it does not relieve us of the grit and severity of the common man’s life.
Historically, the Romans operated on a not-so-rigid class system dictated by ancestry and wealth. The three classes of Roman citizens, which are the Patricians, Equites (or Knights, who became important mid-level civil and military officials as well as cavalrymen), and Plebeians (common citizenry, who became tradesmen, merchants, artisans, rank-and-file soldiers), lived very different lives and worked different livelihoods. The Patricians, or the senatorial class, act as the primary ruling class during Republican times. Patrician families were allowed entry into the senate on the basis of their wealth and ancestry. Some Patrician families claim descent from the Gods (Caesar’s family, or the Julii Caesaris, claim their descent from the goddess Venus) despite their claim to a seat of senator is mostly based on their ancestry, drawing back to early or pre-Republican times. Famous senatorial “gentes” (or clans) include that of the Cornelii (for example, Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus, the victor of the Battle of Zama against Hannibal Barca in c. 202 BC), Junii (for example, the overthrower of the last King of Rome, Lucius Junius Brutus), the Porcii (Marcus Porcius Cato, famous Roman orator, though the younger one live in Caesar’s times).
Not surprisingly, descendants or the adopted benefactors of said gens lived in the timeframe depicted in Rome, represented by members of the Optimate faction, which consisted of traditionalist Roman senators who wanted to preserve oligarchic rule in defence of Republican institutions, including Scipio Metellus, Marcus Junius Brutus (descendant of said Brutus, played by Tobias Menzies, later as Edmure Tully in Game of Thrones), Gaius Cassius Longinus, and Marcus Porcius Cato the Younger, all serving under the charismatic brilliance of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, Caesar’s once-ally and nemesis. These characters go up against, in the damnably byzantine politics and battlefields of antiquity, the Populares faction, with Gaius Julius Caesar at its head, and Marcus Antonius (popularly known in his anglicised form of ‘Mark Antony,’ depicted as a fantasist, narcissist, brutal and temperamental soldier by Antony Purefoy’s brilliant acting) by his side.
The two main protagonists, Centurion Lucius Vorenus and Legionary Titus Pullo, are members of the Roman Thirteenth Legion, of whom Caesar led through his long Gallic wars. Rome goes through the plebeian lives of the two soldiers, introducing not only events in history, but also of Roman culture through daily life, something I found very interesting. As there are too many aspects of Roman life depicted within the HBO Series (and thus the corresponding budget, which was the reason why it was cancelled after its second season), we will take it from a few aspects and how every film set in a historical background or piece of literary fiction should take into account to bring said world into life.
Traditions and Religion
Roman religion and tradition is deeply ingrained within its society. Notably, the Roman state and religion were never seen as two different things by Roman society. The various cults and sects of the Roman pantheon, along with the various deities of Jupiter (the king of the gods, lord of the sky and thunder), Dis (god of the underworld, most notably used by soldiers and fighters especially in damning a certain thing), and even Vesta were depicted with superlative detail. Note the sacrifices conducted in some episodes, the reading of omens, the praying to small figurines in a homely shrine, and the entry of one of Vorenus’ daughter into the Vestal Virgins later on in the season.
The Vestal Virgins themselves were one of the most interesting parts of Roman tradition and religion; they were selected from highborn women at a very young age to enter priesthood and vowed to be chaste for the next 30 years in order to cultivate the sacred fire, located in the temple of Vesta. Vesta herself was the Roman goddess of the hearth, marked by the existence of Vesta’s sacred fire which must not be let out under any circumstances. Superstition was, that if the fire died, it meant that the goddess had abandoned her protection of Rome–meaning that the infernal city itself was under grave danger.
Aside from religion, Rome also depicted many other Roman traditions, such as the patricians’ obscene eating habits of lying down on sofa-like furniture while conversing and getting absolutely drunk as well as exceptionally extravagant, drug-filled orgies. One other interesting event in Rome was the marking of the coming-of-age. Every male Roman citizen was given the right to wear a toga at the age of sixteen (or seventeen, depending on which is closest to 15 March of the year) and therefore participate as adults in civil society. The depiction of Octavian’s (the future Roman Emperor Augustus) coming-of-age rite of passage was depicted at the near-end of season one, something that would drastically change his way of thought and vibrate his transition from boy to man so visible in the transition of seasons.
Also quite interesting was the portrayal of tradesman guilds. In the series, the Herald (the rather bulky fellow with iconic hand gestures) in the forum of Rome mentions in an ‘advertisement’ of sorts, the Roman Guild of Bakers, while mention of guilds of smiths of some sort took place throughout the series.
Aside from Roman religion, Jews were also featured. Timon (Lee Boardman), one of the supporting characters, is depicted as a cutthroat sellsword serving Atia of the Julii (Polly Walker), in more than one way. He is dragged in a conspiracy when the Tetrarch of Galilee (Jewish Royalty) arrives in Rome for ‘adminsitrative business.’
Military Service and Tactics
Military service was a large part of Roman life. Soldiering was considered honourable and serving Rome was, after all, a citizen’s unwritten obligation. In the dying days of the Republic, the Romans had already established a professional volunteer army (in comparison to levied troops, which was the system that prevailed up into the 18th century), allowing the fighting of successive wars all across her borders and the gradual expansion of the Pax Romana. Citizen-soldiers like Pullo and Vorenus were obliged with 20 years’ service and were entitled to a percentage of booty and war prizes. After retirement, ‘old legionaries’ may sign up again to become evocati, or veteran troops, serving as the crack troops held in reserve in battles, who earned multiple times the wage of a normal soldier and were immune to menial duties. This took place when Vorenus decided to take Mark Antony’s offer to join his army as a ‘Prefect of the Evocati Cohort,’ a traditionally equestrian position, of which Vorenus had achieved (Equestrian status was achievable after the ownership of 10,000 sesterces in assets, after all). He also had to go through an interesting rite of passage to get it.
Roman military tactics were depicted according to commentaries of the time, such as the Comentarii de Bello Gallico by Caesar. Roman legionaries fought in close formation, standardly going in formation 10-across and 8-deep (in a rectangular formation of 80 men each, called a century). With shields raised, legionaries covered their sectors, and watched for each other. Upon a certain amount of time, the centurion would blow a whistle to signify the change of the foremost front man, and the first-ranker quickly switched to the man behind him. This allowed equal distribution of the fighting, thus allowing Roman legionaries to fight longer than their counterparts. This was depicted well in the opening scene (perhaps the Battle of Alesia) and the epic Battle of Phillipi (in the second series) between Brutus and the second Triumvirate (Octavian Caesar, Antony, and Lepidus). Uniforms and arms were also accurate to the era, with the Roman soldiers wearing in variation of military tunics in scarlet and off-white (undyed) colours, while wearing lorica hamata or mail cuirass, instead of the inaccurately portrayed lorica segmentata (segmented plate armour cuirass) often used in games and films. This type of armour was not used in the time of Caesar, however, and came in the later Imperial period of the first century to third century AD, in limited use. The ‘square’ Roman shield (scutum), the pilum and pila (throwables or javelins), and the gladius hispanensis (Spanish sword), the Celt-inspired republican helmet (galea) along with the not-so-famous Roman sarcina, or luggage, which each legionary brought their own, were also pictured widely.
Turmoil and Squalor
Viewers could often see the tough-living, dirty, and ragged streets of Rome, then one of the most populous and advanced cities throughout the Mediterranean. Even the home of the Vorenii, where Lucius Vorenus and his family lived, was not as fancy as one would think of the ‘extravagant’ Romans. Many of the citizens of Rome lived in poverty and in a state of squalor; murder was not uncommon, and gang fights over disputes were perhaps the way most citizens preferred it to be finished. Courts of law did exist in Rome, but not really portrayed within the TV series.
Another interesting fact was that the Romans often used grafitti to express themselves. Naturally, due to this, the walls of the small streets in Rome were decorated with entertaining, and sometimes perverse, pictures courtesy of Your Fellow Citizen.
Clothing and Fashion
Roman society also had its dress codes. Formal occasions were marked by the wearing of the toga (broad, purple-stripe for senators, two stripes for equestrian/knights, and a plain white for plebeians) for men, although in day-to-day life, a tunic–a piece of cloth that went down to above the knees–were worn. For the regular citizen, these tunics were mostly plain and sometimes dyed, though for nobility, the tunic was often decorated with embroidery to display status. The Romans did live by the code ‘you are what you wear’–perhaps something that lives down to Italians today.
For women, the stola was the most common dress, in tandem with the toga. Stolae were somehow a timeless piece, with variations worn from the times of the mid-republic (3rd century BC) up to the late Byzantine Empire (15th century AD). Women who wore the stola were seen as graceful and honourable, and this was depicted in the various forms of the stola, from a light, near-transparent garment to the rich deep red and/or other colours of whatever Atia of the Julii (a depiction of a woman of extravagance) wore throughout the series. Stola were mostly worn by married women, to display modesty and maturity. Younger women often wore tunics inspired by the Greek chiton (as were many parts of Roman culture).
Despite in a short space of two seasons, it was remarkable how much of ancient Rome was able to be portrayed by the series. The antics of Titus Pullo, the stoicism of Lucius Vorenus, the extravagance of Mark Antony, the grace and shrewdness of Cleopatra, the smart power-plays of Caesar, and the idealism of Brutus were all depicted well within Rome. Although it was cancelled, it had managed to amaze many ancient history enthusiasts with its authenticity and exploration of each character through personal and interpersonal conflicts. If you want to create a period drama, just write for fun, or want to binge watch something exceptionally, and I say again, exceptionally, good, Le Citoyen highly recommends HBO’s Rome.
Plus, if you’re waiting for Game of Thrones’ final season, and want to watch a series of a such (but based on real events), go watch it. Wherever you can. Go! Go!

Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus.
I know what you’re thinking.
What a name!
I agree.
Sadly, the man with this name is responsible for a lot of naughty nonsense.
First off, he murdered his own mother.
If that wasn’t enough, he also murdered his first wife.
And his second wife?
Kicked her to death while she was pregnant.
Yeah, we’re dealing with a monstrosity.
Sadly, his cruelty wasn’t just reserved for his close family members.
He also used to host parties where he’d light people on fire (usually Christians) while he and his guests would frolic to fiddle music.
All while, Rome was engulfed in flames.
The guy was a psycho.
And in this article, I’m going to go all in on the lad known as Nero: Rome’s most notorious emperor.
Nero was the fifth Roman emperor, ruling from 54 AD to 68 AD.

Helpful hints on how to have a miserable but interesting time in the Eternal City.
Listen, I love Rome. I really do but now that we’re more or less free to travel again, I feel compelled to fill you in on the Eternal City. Masochists will love it. So will anybody else drawn to stress and anxiety. Don’t get me wrong, Rome has a lot of things going for it. Historical buildings, pizza, magnificent museums, pizza, stunning churches, pizza. Did I say pizza? Over four million tourists a year visit the Eternal City and, for the most part, Rome is prepared. Yet there are a few trouble spots that can turn a Roman holiday into a Roman nightmare.
Rome is always crowded and those walking tours led by tour guides with flags or umbrellas only make things worse. These human centipedes shuffle, and I do mean shuffle, along the sidewalk and hold up the rest of us with places to go. They’re everywhere but particularly dense around the Vatican Museum and the Trevi Fountain. Especially the Tevi. The Fountain is hemmed in by narrow streets that funnel pedestrians into the site like sheep to the slaughter. Good luck with getting a clear view. Keep in mind there are equally…

Book Review: Are We Rome? The Fall of an Empire and the Fate of America by Cullen Murphy,https://medium.com/@desireewinns/book-review-are-we-rome-the-fall-of-an-empire-and-the-fate-of-america-by-cullen-murphy-6ba9c929abf2,"Sign up

Is America the new Roman Empire, and if so, will it meet the same fate? This book argues that America and Rome are similar in terms of their psychology and soft power, from the way Washington and Rome view themselves as the center of their worlds, to the global and historical impacts of their cultures. In the beginning, Murphy notes Freud’s comparison of the human psyche and the ruins of Rome, the possibility of histories existing simultaneously rather than one after the other. It’s a theme that runs throughout each chapter as Murphy compares the militaries, borders, people, and cultures of Rome and America. Considering how much Roman culture and iconography shape the ways Americans symbolize and discuss their own power, it really does seem like Rome and America exist together. However, Murphy posits that America’s capability for relatively rapid social transformation (especially in just two centuries) is what separates it from its doomed predecessor, and what will save it from the same fate. I’d pick this book up if you’re interested in learning how the cultural and psychological power of empires expands beyond centuries. In the end you’ll definitely wonder if Rome ever did fall.

Rome is a city of amazing pizza, pasta, and gelato, but if you’re looking for a healthy break from all those delicious carbs, here are 4 great places where you can get fresh juices and smoothies:
Esco Sazio — This adorable little shop offers completely organic juices and smoothies, in addition to healthy sandwiches and salads. Swing on one of their wooden swings as you drink your juice and enjoy the chalkboard-meets-chandelier ambiance. Our girls loved the chocolate banana protein smoothie, and I enjoyed my tropical juice with pineapple and guava.
Via dei Banchi Vecchi, 135, 00186 Roma, Italy
Pronto — We stumbled across this restaurant in Rome’s Monti neighborhood, near the Colosseum, and stopped in when we saw their “fresh juices” sign. Their fruit is freshly chopped, juiced, and blended (if you get juice with pears in it) right in front of you, and the three juices that we tried were all fantastic. You can take your juice outside and hang out at the fountain with the locals while you drink it and take in the area’s energetic vibe.
Via dei Serpenti, 163, Roma
Aromaticus — This restaurant is also in the trendy Monti area, and they serve fresh juices and clean, mostly raw and unprocessed foods (salads, hummus, beef tartare, etc.). The shop itself is cute and hip, decorated with vintage cookbooks and selling potted herbs and gardening supplies, and the food and juice are excellent. The pineapple-mint juice was one of the best juices I’ve ever had, so perfectly sweet and delicious, and Joshua loved his Greek salad with pita bread, hummus, cherry tomatoes, olives, and feta cheese.
Via Urbana, 134, 00184 Roma, Italy
AllBiOne — Self-described as “organic street food”, AllBiOne serves organic juices, cut-up fresh fruit, and 14 different kinds of organic meatballs… everything from beef and tomato or chicken and curry to vegetarian eggplant parmesan or ricotta and pecorino cheese balls. Everything we ate was tasty, but I highly recommend the cheese “meat”balls, and the juices we got were fresh and delicious.
The restaurant is a short walk from the Colosseum, and the owner is really friendly — he overheard us talking about wanting strawberries in a juice for the girls, and he offered to make a strawberry-apple-orange juice for them that wasn’t listed on the board; it turned out to be perfect for them!
Largo Corrado Ricci, 34, Roma, Italy
Do you know another great juice bar in Rome? Leave a comment and share it with us!

We had been waiting 30 minutes for the tour to begin. Stepping into a small spot of shade, I wiped the sweat from my face. It was only 10:30, and already the temperature had soared to 95.
“I thought this tour was supposed to start at 10,” I grumbled to my husband, who was also angling for shade.
“It was also supposed to be a private tour,” he said. “But there are 19 of us.”
My husband and I like private tours when we travel, to avoid the sort of scenario we were currently experiencing. Group tour guides are informative and engaging, but there are always tourists who can’t keep up, want to cut the excursion short, or show up late.
Today, two people hadn’t shown up. The excursion was supposed to be a nine-hour walking tour of Rome, and I was ready to get started. Our guide, an Italian woman with thick, black hair and a round face flushed with heat, tried to keep the 19 tourists in our group cheerful.
“Just a few more minutes. I believe the late ones are coming,” she chirped, forcing a smile. “Ah! Here they are!”
I watched as two grumpy blonde women trudged through the crowd towards our group. One was youngish, her expression…

As is well-known, Rome was founded by the legendary brothers Romulus and Remus, who originated from Alba Longa and belonged to one of the Latin tribes. However, as Rome grew into a vast and powerful state, the Romans decided having only local Italian shepherds among their ancestors wasn’t very prestigious. It would be much cooler if the Romans descended from a well-known, celebrated people in legends, even better — from a great hero. And they found such a heroic ancestor. He was Aeneas, a hero from Troy who left his homeland after the city’s fall.
This legend did not immediately become widely accepted among the Romans. The 1st-century BC Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus presents three versions of the Roman origins he knew: Italy, Libya, and Greece. In the last case, he refers to Greek colonists who had long lived on the Apennine Peninsula. However, Dionysius favored the view that the Romans were of mixed Greek-Italian origin. At the same time, Dionysius mentions the Roman version that Romulus and Remus were sons of Aeneas, implying that Rome was built by the second generation of Trojan refugees.

Celebrating the Western tradition, from Romulus to Rembrandt.

The traditional story of Rome’s founding is a classic tale, one that every schoolchild used to learn. One of the greatest civilizations of the Western world, Rome shaped our modern society more than any other ancient culture (with the possible exception of Greece). To understand the incredible story — somewhat dubious historicity aside — is to gain insight into the folklore and heritage that have inspired twenty-five centuries of thinkers, creators, rulers, and ordinary people who looked backwards at the mistakes and achievements of the past for wisdom and direction in the present.
Many charge that learning such tales in the Digital Age is anachronistic at best and exclusionary at worst. But there is undeniably something transcendent about them, a special quality that explains Rome’s unique ability to capture the hearts and souls of luminaries from every time and place, from Dante to Gibbon to Toni Morrison.
Studying the history of ancient Rome ought not to be an exercise in self-flagellation, in which one allows the often-savage realities of the ancient world to overshadow the innovations and triumphs of an extraordinary time. Instead, it ought to be a celebration of the grandeur that was Rome, imperfections and all, and a recognition of the seminal role she played in shaping the West.
And so without further ado I present the traditional and mythological history of Ancient Rome from its founding to its fall in three parts.
On April 21, 753 BC, the twins Romulus and Remus stood atop a rather unremarkable Italian hillock — it was known as the “Palatine” — and founded a small settlement that would rise to become one of the most dominant and lasting empires in world history. This ten-part survey briefly traces the traditional and legendary history of Rome, over the course of which I shall attempt to answer the crucial question: how did a diminutive encampment on the Palatine rise to global dominance, and what became of its grandeur?
Our story begins at Troy. According to legend, in the 1200s BC a titanic struggle was waged between the Greeks and the Trojans, inhabitants of a city known as Troy upon the Dardanelles in modern-day Turkey. The cause of the war was divine; three of the most prominent goddesses in the Greek pantheon (Hera, queen of the gods; Athena, goddess of wisdom; and Aphrodite, goddess of sexual love) found themselves in the midst of a passionate disagreement over who was the most beautiful. To settle their dispute, Zeus (king of the gods) appointed Paris, a Trojan prince, as judge. Attempting to sway Paris, each of the three goddesses offered him a precious reward should he choose her, but it was Aphrodite’s offer — that he be wed to Helen, wife of a Greek king called Menelaus — that was most convincing to the Trojan squire. Her promise was swiftly delivered upon, and Helen was spirited away from the court of Menelaus to the high walls of Priam, king of Troy.
War followed forthwith, as Greeks hastened to Troy to support Menelaus and reclaim his snatched wife from Paris. The fighting was intense, lengthy, and heroic — much of it is retold in Homer’s Iliad, most especially the exploits of a Greek general named Achilles. At last, supported by many of the gods and aided by cunning trickery in the “Trojan Horse” (a fake peace offering that in fact contained Greek soldiers within its belly, allowing the marauders to flood the city by night and open its gates to the invaders waiting outside), the Greeks breached the walls, and began to pillage and burn.
From the carnage escaped a particular Trojan prince — Aeneas, a son of Venus — accompanied by a retinue of comrades. In search of friendly lands and a place to found a new city, he set out from Troy by ship and, after an arduous journey, arrived on the shores of North Africa to a city called Carthage (modern-day Tunis), the home of Queen Dido. The people were friendly, milk and honey flowed, and, most notoriously, Dido and Aeneas fell into the throngs of love for one another, a rather scandalous affair for the previously-unbetrothed Dido and the now-uxorious Aeneas. Alas, this was not to be the Romans’ final home; for Hermes, the messenger god, flitted down to Aeneas, whom he found strutting bejeweled atop the high walls of Carthage, and bore to him a fateful message from Zeus himself: Aeneas must head to Latium (the region of Italy around modern-day Rome), as was his fate. Immediately, devoted Aeneas (or pius Aeneas, as goes the famous Latin phrase) set out, and soon reaches Latium. However, his departure was not casualty-free; in a fit of woeful despair at seeing her lover gone, Dido stabbed herself to death, leaving a final curse on the Trojans that shall reappear later in this survey. Much of the tale of Aeneas’ journey to Rome, it should be noted, is retold in Vergil’s Aeneid.
Thus we conclude the first chapter of Rome’s history, with Trojan ships on Latian sands.
Having shored in Italy, “Aeneas f[ound] not peace but another terrible war” (Ragan, Survey). A local king, Latinus, sparked conflict when he betrothed his daughter Lavinia to the newly arrived Aeneas instead of the man to whom he had already promised her, Turnus. In the ensuing strife, in which the Trojan-Latinus coalition fought Turnus and his local allies, Aeneas slew Turnus and subsequently married Lavinia. He died in another skirmish shortly afterward.
Aeneas’ body was never recovered, but his name remains forever etched into the towering stele of Western civilization, a fleeting ember of once-mighty Troy rekindled into the blazing inferno that was Rome. His legacy would be taken up by his young son Ascanius (also known as Iulus). The year, as legend has it, is circa 1175 BC.
Thirty or so years later, Ascanius founded the town of Alba Longa in the nearby Alban Hills, about twenty miles east of the Seven Hills that will later mark the famous site of Rome. Ascanius is the first in a 400-year line of Alban kings — the so-called Silvian Dynasty — that ends with King Proca and his two sons: Numitor (the elder) and Amulius (the younger). Upon Proca’s death sometime in the 8th century BC, Numitor, being the elder brother, ought to have inherited the throne. Amulius, however, had other plans, and he usurped the throne, murdered Numitor’s sons, and cast Numitor himself into exile. In a rather Machiavellian twist, wanting to end his brother’s bloodline Amulius forced Numitor’s daughter Rhea Silvia to become a Vestal Virgin, consigning her to celibate priestesshood.
Divine intervention followed forthwith, and Rhea Silvia became impregnated by Mars, the god of war [virgin pregnancies tend to resurface, no?]. Amulius orders the products of the pregnancy, twin boys named Romulus and Remus, to be left on the banks of the Tiber River to perish [cue Moses…]. Escaping doom, the twins were found and nursed by a she-wolf who brought them to a cave known as “the Lupercal.” Soon thereafter, the infants were found by a shepherd, Faustulus, who took them in and raised them as his own (along with his wife, Acca Larentia). Eventually, having discovered their family background and having learned of the injustice Amulius had wrought, they wrested back control of Alba Longa and restored Numitor, their now-agéd grandfather, to the throne. Wrongs thus righted, the brothers set out, looking to found a city of their own.
The twins and their followers journeyed west to a marshy spot near the Tiber River, ringed by seven hills: the Palatine, the Quirinal, the Viminal, the Esquiline, the Caelian, the Aventine, and the Capitoline. Romulus surmounted the Palatine hill and began setting the boundaries of a new hamlet, Rome. The legendary date of this founding is April 21, 753 B.C. Remus, in brotherly scorn, leapt over the Rome’s diminutive walls. Romulus, ever the patriot, felled his brother with his blade, declaring, “Sic deinde, quicumque alius transiliet moenia mea” — “Thus henceforth to anyone who should o’erleap my bulwarks.”
Rid of pesky Remus, Romulus set to the task of governance and growth, making Rome (specifically the Capitoline hill) an asylum that welcomed all who wished to join the new town. Unsurprisingly, such an arrangement attracted a less-than-ideal rabble — the men were raucous and criminal, the women sparse. Stung by a neighboring tribe’s refusal to provide their daughters in marriage to the Roman ruffians, Romulus announced a Festival of Neptune (the sea god) in his new town, attracting scores of local tribespeople. With the beady eyes of the Romans fixed upon the Sabine daughters — the young, gallivanting women from the Sabine tribe — Romulus gave the signal, and the Romans rushed out from their hidey-holes, each seizing a Sabine lass for his own and absconding back onto the fortified heights of the Palatine. The festival, needless to say, quickly dispersed.
The Roman snatching — or, as it became known, “The Rape of the Sabine Women” — was rather poorly received by the duped Sabines, who quickly armed themselves and prepared to make battle. Skirmishes ensued, but the final engagement of the war, the Battle of the Lacus Curtius, was ended when the Roman wives (yes, the very Sabine girls who had only recently been kidnapped) threw themselves into the fray and demanded that conflict cease in an event often called “The Intervention of the Sabine Women.” Impelled to peace, the two towns merged, the new entity jointly ruled by Romulus and Titus Tatius, the king of the Sabines.
Around this time Romulus went about planting the societal seeds that would sprout into the grand trunks of Roman civilization. To one hundred hand-picked followers he gave the title “patres” — “fathers”. These men would serve in an official capacity as his advisory council, the Senate. The descendants of these early “fathers” would later be known as the “patricii,” or “Patricians.” The rest of the citizenry were merely the “plebs,” or “Plebeians.” From the union of these two delineated strata (the Senate and the masses) comes the famous phrase SPQR — “Senatus PopulusQue Romanus,” or “the Senate and People of Rome.” Another division of the city — thirty “curiae,” named after thirty of the Sabine women who had intervened — provided the voting units of the “Comitia Curiata,” or “Roman Assembly.”
Over the next several years of his rule (by now Titus Tatius had perished during a riot in nearby Lavinium, leaving Romulus the sole king), Romulus oversaw the city’s continued growth as it pressed outward in conquest. In the late 8th century B.C., Romulus died when, while surveying the troops arranged on the Campus Martius (Plain of Mars) from the Quirinal hill, a cloud enshrouded him. When the cloud lifted, Romulus was nowhere to be found — either murdered in a conspiracy by the Senators or, as the Roman historian Livy more dubiously asserts, ascended to heaven under the auspices of Mars. Romulus was later deified under the name “Quirinus,” attracting a significant cult following. He reigned for thirty-seven years, the first of Rome’s “Seven Kings.”
Thus we conclude the second chapter of our history of Rome, with Romulus dead and a new king, as we shall soon see, poised to spring from the ashes.
Somewhat unusually, the Roman kingship was elective: The Senate nominated new kings during the interregna that followed monarchs’ deaths (during which nominating process various Senators would serve as temporary rulers), and the Assembly confirmed or rejected those nominees. The arrangements surrounding Romulus’ succession were no exception; the lengthy, one-year interregnum that followed Romulus’ death saw ten Senators rule as interregnes, or “between-kings,” before a worthy successor was nominated and confirmed: Numa Pompilius, Rome’s second king.
Numa Pompilius: The Pacifist and Priest (r. 716–673 BC)
Numa’s accession betokened a city exhausted from the constant conflict and rapid expansion of Romulus’ reign: more scholar than fighter, Numa was famed for his disciplined lifestyle, religious dedication, and vast wisdom. Numa’s selection marked a successful compromise between the Roman and Sabine factions of the population — though himself a Sabine himself from the town of Cures, Numa was uncontroversial and widely respected, characteristics that rendered him acceptable to each of the bickering factions.
Numa is chiefly remembered for his pacifism and his institution of the sacra, Rome’s religious traditions. Among his first decrees as monarch was the dissolution of the guard that had comprised Romulus’ personal entourage — an act both of peacemaking and self-preservation, as the guards’ loyalty was questionable. One of Numa’s most significant contributions was the establishment of several priestly orders, including pontifices and flamines (higher and lower classes, respectively, of standard priests), the Salii (the twelve so-called “leaping priests” of Mars), the fetiales (the priests who advised the Senate on treaties, foreign affairs, and official declarations of war), and the Pontifex Maximus, the high priest of Rome. Most significantly, he imported from Alba Longa the Vestal Virgins — the famed priestesses of Vesta (goddess of the hearth) who, as ceremonial stewards of all Rome, kept her sacred fire aflame. Numa also constructed several temples, including the famous Temple of Janus, whose doors were closed during peacetime and flung open during wars. Tellingly, the doors remained closed for Numa’s entire reign. Another of his lasting contributions was the institution of a twelve-month calendar adjusted to the solar and lunar years, with provisions for “holy” and “unholy” days.
Throughout his reign, Numa asserted his direct connection to the gods by means of his marriage to Egeria, a nymph who supposedly furnished him with divine directives upon his periodic visits to her. Numa died of old age in 673 BC, having presided over a long period of peace and productivity in the city on the Tiber.
Tullus Hostilius: The Warrior (r. 673–642 BC)
Where Numa was priest, Tullus was warrior. Scornful of the religious obsession that had settled over the city and believing Rome to have grown “soft” under Numa’s pacifism, Tullus Hostilius set about renewing the military prowess the city had enjoyed under Romulus and sought to expand its imperium, or “sphere of influence” (later “empire”). Tullus waged war on several neighboring peoples, including the Sabines (whom he defeated with a cavalry charge in a battle near Malitiosa Forest, inflicting heavy casualties), the confederated Veientes and Fidenates (whom he defeated even despite the treacherous retreat of Rome’s Alban “allies”), and even Alba Longa, the ancient birthplace of Romulus. It is this final conquest for which Tullus is best known today.
Cattle begat the strife. When a small herd of the beasts (owned by a Roman farmer) wandered into Alban territory, and the relevant landowners refused to return them to Rome, Tullus did what any reasonable leader might have done: He declared war against all Alba Longa. Undaunted, the Albans marshaled themselves under their king, Cluilius, and marched to the outskirts of Rome. Quickly, they dug a trench — the aptly-named Cluilian trench — around the entire city. Soon, though, Cluilius perished of unspecified causes. [“Cluilius… moritur,” the Roman historian Livy helpfully elaborates: “Cluilius dies” (Ab Urbe Condita, 1.23.4).]
To replace Cluilius, the Albans appointed Mettius Fufetius as military dictator, granting him absolute command over the city and its forces. The two leaders — Tullus and Fufetius — drew up their armies into battle and marched out to face each other. Neither side wanting to wage what would surely be a bloody and destructive war — for the neighboring Etruscans would have looked on with glee as their two main territorial rivals tore each other to shreds, ready to swoop in and conquer the weakened victor — Fufetius suggested a more efficient resolution: a duel. Miraculously, each army had among its ranks a set of triplets: the Romans had the Horatii brothers, and the Albans had the Curiatii brothers. The teams of brothers would fight to the bloody death for their countries, and Tullus and Fufetius each entered into solemn vows pledging that they would abide by the outcome of the fight. I borrow from Ragan’s Survey to recount the conflict that ensued:
The contest was exciting: with two Horatians slain, but all three Curiatians wounded, the surviving Horatius began to flee! The Romans no doubt groaned, thinking their champion a coward. But there was method in this. For as he ran, he succeeded in separating the pursuing Curiatii whom he was able to fight individually and each of whom he killed. So, the Albans surrendered themselves and their town. The Romans, however, characteristic of these early wars, took the Albans as a whole into their citizen body; the town was destroyed — except for the temples — so that the Albans would become fully a part of their new community.
So, with that, Romulus’ hometown was no more, living on only in the memory of its now-Roman residents. A final finishing twist to conclude the conflict: the Alban dictator, Fufetius, soon proved a treacherous man. In the aforementioned Roman war against the Fidenates, it was he who pulled the Albans back from the fight, intending to linger in the backdrop until a winner was evident, at which point he would march out in “victory,” pretending to have supported whoever won. But Tullus was no fool: perceiving Fufetius’ treachery, he bade his calvary raise their spears, shielding the retreating Alban “allies” from view of his infantry and thus keeping the Roman morale intact, preserving Rome’s shot at victory. After the battle, Tullus punished Fufetius (also known by his first name, Metius) as he saw fit. I leave it to Vergil to recount the gory details of Metius’ death as he is ripped limb from limb by four horses (Aeneid Book VIII, tr. John Dryden):
Near this, the traitor Metius, stretch’d betweenFour fiery steeds, is dragg’d along the green,By Tullus’ doom: the brambles drink his blood,And his torn limbs are left the vulture’s food.
In addition to these military conquests, Tullus is notable for his construction of a new Senate building — the Curia Hostilia — which lasted for over 500 years after his death.
Alas, for all his military grandeur Tullus had neglected to honor the gods, and soon the city was afflicted with plague and famine as recompense for his scanty religiosity. Desperate, Tullus turned to the writings of his predecessor Numa, the expert on all things divine, and frantically yet inaccurately attempted to perform the rituals described therein. The gods, in no mood to tolerate such tomfoolery, struck Tullus with a thunderbolt, setting both him and his palace alight and bringing an end to his 31-year rule.
Ancus Marcius: The Builder (r. 640–616 BC)
Perhaps weary again of conflict and conquest, the Romans chose the more subdued Ancus Marcius — grandson of Numa — as their fourth king. Where Tullus had erred in the eyes of the gods, Ancus charted a safer course: his first act as king was to have the religious rites laid down by Numa copied down and displayed to the public, lest they ever again be ill-performed.
By Ancus’ time, Rome had become a profitable and well-positioned town controlling a respectable portion of Latium, the territorial region around the city. The city lay along the Via Salaria, or Salt Road, an ancient trading route that proved a welcome boon to the growing city. Taking advantage of the city’s strategic position, Ancus sent out a colonia (colony) of citizens to found Ostia at the mouth of the Tiber, a crucial expedition that secured the surrounding salt flats (providing a reliable revenue stream for the fledgling city) and extended Roman territory to the sea. He constructed the first bridge across the Tiber, the Pons Sublicius (Sublician Bridge), in 642 BC. The continued arrival of Etruscans from the north, skilled engineers in masonry, road construction, and swamp drainage, further complemented Ancus’ infrastructure projects. He built Rome’s first prison, the Mamertine Prison (which, in the following centuries, housed a number of high-profile prisoners, including Vercingetorix, Jugurtha, St. Peter, and Sejanus), atop the Capitoline hill. He fortified the Janiculum hill on the west bank of the Tiber, dug a ditch fortification (the Fossa Quiritium) on the city’s landward side, and constructed Rome’s first aqueduct.
Though more peaceful than his predecessor, Ancus did not shrink from conflict; he fought against the Latins, conquering the town of Politorum (whose residents were relocated to the base of the Aventine hill in Rome) — and later reconquering and destroying it when it was re-settled by more Latin peoples — along with Tellenae, Ficana, and Medullia, a conquest that brought loot to the coffers of Ancus and resettled Latins to the base of the Palatine hill. These resettlements, along with a growing population and increasing social stratification, helped form the early stages of the plebeian class at Rome. Furthermore, he expanded Roman territory into the Maesian Forest, seizing it from the Veientes.
After 24 years of successful rule, Ancus, the last of Rome’s Latin-Sabine kings, died, bringing to a close a period of economic and territorial expansion, infrastructure development, and social growth for the adolescent town on the banks of the Tiber.
Thus we conclude the third chapter of our brief history of Rome, with four successful kings etched into the people’s memory and new rulers from the north poised to take the throne.
During the reign of Ancus Marcius (640–616 BC), a talented man named Lucomo arrived from Etruria, a civilization to the north of Rome, with his wife, Tanaquil. Lucomo brought his peoples’ skill in engineering, stonework, and logistics; Tanaquil, their prowess in omen interpretation. According to tradition, this power couple was destined for greatness from the moment of their arrival at Rome: As they approached the city, an eagle swooped down, stole Lucomo’s hat, and quickly replaced it. Tanaquil, the “impartial” wife and observer, deemed this an omen of his future greatness.
Biased as it was, Tanaquil’s observation soon came to fruition. At Rome, Lucomo took the name “Lucius Tarquinius” (“Priscus,” meaning “Elder,” was later added — we shall soon see why), gained access to the city’s high society through favor and courtesy, and, eventually, became a friend of the aging Ancus. So close an associate of Ancus’ was he that the king named him guardian of his two sons, both mere youths. But this was a decision that would prove fatal for the line of poor Ancus.
With old Ancus on his deathbed in 616 BC, crafty Tarquin (or, more likely, the ambitious Tanaquil) sent the two sons on a lengthy hunting expedition. When Ancus died shortly thereafter, Tarquin leapt into action, making a case for his own election to the kingship before the Curiate Assembly (the thirty-tribe popular assembly presided over by the king — recall the thirty curiae named after the intervening Sabine women), a case he bolstered with bribery. Needless to say, he succeeded: The two sons, away on their jolly hunt, were exiled, and Lucius Tarquinius Priscus — better known by the anglicized Tarquin the Elder — became Rome’s fifth king.
L. Tarquinius Priscus: The Engineer (r. 616–579 BC)
Scurrilous accession aside, Tarquin oversaw a period of necessary construction, military success, and effective reform in the Eternal City. Though often overtowered by the whirlwind of reforms wrought by Servius Tullius, his successor, Tarquinius Priscus’ fruitful reign ought not be overlooked.
Many of his engineering projects became the defining monuments of Rome. He built the Circus Maximus (a chariot-racing arena) at the base of the Palatine hill; he laid the foundation for the Temple of Iuppiter Optimus Maximus (the High God of the Roman pantheon) on the Capitoline hill, to be completed by his son; and he constructed a massive sewer, the cloaca maxima, to drain the swamp between the Palatine and Capitoline hills, which would later become the site of the famous Roman Forum. He also continued the construction of walled defenses around the entire city.
On the military front, Tarquin initiated a war against the neighboring Latins, seizing the town of Apiolae and a great deal of booty, instituting annual games as celebration. (He would go on to take and assimilate additional Latin cities in subsequent offensives.) He then weathered an Etruscan-supported Sabine assault with exceptional difficulty — fighting spilled into the streets of Rome, and the Sabines were only barely repelled. Following an initial surprise attack that inflicted heavy losses, the Sabines withdrew to prepare for another offensive. Livy recounts the dramatic second skirmish (Ab Urbe Condita I.37, tr. Aubrey de Sélincourt — an edition from the Heritage Club that I heartily recommend):
Hostilities with the Sabines were now resumed. The striking-power of Rome had been increased by the expansion of the cavalry [which Tarquin had completed during the Sabine respite], but in what followed it was a strategy that played the decisive part. A stack of dry timber which had been lying on the bank of the Anio was set alight and the blazing logs thrown into the water. A good wind kept them burning, and many were carried down by the stream and became lodged amongst the piles of the bridge, which they set on fire. This was alarming enough for the Sabines while they were fighting, but worse when their resistance broke; for the burning bridge prevented their retreat, and large numbers of them escaped the enemy only to perish in the river. Their equipment floated down the Tiber to Rome, where it was recognized for what it was and brought the news of victory almost before a messenger could get through.
As terms of the parley that followed, Rome received the Sabine town of Collatia, in which Tarquin placed his nephew Egerius as commander of the Roman garrison. Following the victory over the Sabines, Tarquin celebrated a triumph, or general’s victory parade, on September 13, 585 BC. However, this conflict poked the Etruscan bear, for they had supported the Sabine effort; twelve Etruscan cities banded together and seized a Roman outpost at Fidenae, a town to the north of the city. This seizure kicked off a bloody conflict that saw Tarquin lead the Romans against his native civilization. Rome was victorious, subjugating the truculent Etruscan cities and gaining great wealth.
Tarquin’s remarkable successes carried over into the social and political realms. To stave off the Sabines (see above), he had expanded the number of cavalry centuries from three to six — thus doubling the size of the equites, or knight class. He increased the Senate by one hundred members — importantly, among whom was a man from the gens Octavii, the family of Rome’s first emperor 600 years later. He introduced many Etruscan military, political, and religious rites that later became hallmarks of Roman rule.
Tarquin went as he came, surrounded by divine phenomena and urged on by his ambitious wife. I leave it to Ragan to report the strange story (Survey):
A very unusual event occurred one night in the royal nursery. The woman watching the sleeping children (both royal and household children were there) screamed when the hair of one of the children, a slave-woman’s [Ocrisia’s] son, seemed to be on fire. This brought Queen Tanaquil who, when she saw that the fire was not harming the child, took this as a sign of destiny for the child. She convinced her husband that the child, Servius Tullius, was thus designated by the gods to succeed to the throne. Some years later, Tarquin’s earlier treachery against Ancus’ sons caught up with him. One day, as the king was giving audience to citizens, a foreigner asked to speak to the king in private, on a matter of great importance. The king agreed and, when alone, the man (hired by Ancus’ exiled sons) took an ax to the king’s head and escaped. Tanaquil, wanting to secure the succession for Servius, carefully managed the situation as the king lay dying. She would give out daily reports about this recovery — knowing full well he was dead — all the while securing the support she would need to gain the kingship for Servius. This done, the death of Tarquin was divulged, and Servius Tullius, formerly the son of a slave, became the sixth king of the Romans.
And so Servius Tullius, once a slave boy, took power at Rome.
Servius Tullius: The Slave (r. 578–535 BC)
Servius was a king who knew his origins — his allegiances lay with the Plebs, the people, rather than with the aristocratic Patricians and noble families of the old order, to whom he seemed a mere “populist demagogue” (Ragan, Survey). Indeed, throughout the reigns of Servius and his successor, Tarquin the Proud, the Roman citizenry came into its own, earning participation in government and power in administration. Perhaps, though, the collapse of the old order brought the state down with it — the excesses and exiguities, triumphs and trivialities, virtues and vices of the Roman Kingdom crumbled under Tarquin the Proud. But all that is to come.
Servius’ great triumphs were social. In a reform known today as the Servian Constitution, he organized the Roman citizenry into five classes according to wealth, rather than to birth. The specific mechanism of this system — divided according to the armor each man could afford in wartime — relieved the poorest of their military duties. To accomplish this feat, he instituted the first census, or counting of Rome’s citizens and property, overseen by a censor. This division resulted in the Comitia Centuriata (the Centuriate Assembly), a body consisting of 193 “centuries” into which all Romans were sorted. However, while theoretically granting the Plebeians a voice in governance and law, the Comitia Centuriata did little to ease the Patrician [moneyed elite] chokehold on Roman administration — 180 of the 193 centuries consisted of the wealthiest estates, granting 5% of the Roman populace deciding power in all matters of state. (This unbalanced representation was accomplished by a crafty grouping of the classes: While the lowest estates had hundreds or even thousands of members, the highest ones had very few — think of a radical version of the U.S. electoral college.)
Though seemingly unbalanced, this division aptly reflected the contribution each class made to the Roman military: The highest classes were expected to contribute vast funds and troops to the city’s military endeavors, while the lowest ones contributed nothing at all. A democracy? No. But an accurate reflection of the relative weight and import of military matters in ancient societies? Yes. Before we leer at this classist system with a modern eye, perhaps we ought to recall Burke: “A true natural aristocracy is not a separate interest in the state, or separable from it. It is an essential integrant part of any large body rightly constituted. It is formed out of a class of legitimate presumptions, which taken as generalities, must be admitted for actual truths.” Political philosophy aside, Servius’ reforms laid the political, legal, social, and ideological bases for the Roman Republic to come.
​Class questions aside, the developments under Servius extended beyond his Constitution. Legend has it — though an archaeologist perhaps doesn’t— that he constructed the Servian Wall, enclosing 608 acres and all seven of the famous hills of Rome (Servius had expanded the city onto the Quirinal, Viminal, and Equiline). For the pauper, he was a prince: He eliminated debt imprisonment and eased the tax burden on the lowest classes, albeit in exchange for a paucity of political representation (see above). Furthermore, he entrusted the precariat to its land, labor, and liberty, dividing public land and letting the poor farm and tend to themselves. He divided the people of Rome into four tribes and the entire country into thirty one. He founded a very important shrine to Diana on the Aventine Hill, a shrine that became the administrative center of a critical alliance between Rome and the Latin League (an alliance of neighboring tribes and communities aligned against Roman expansion). For the first time, Servius energetically delineated the bounds of citizenship: His Constitutional ukase placed freedmen within his classes, thus enfranchising former slaves and bolstering the citizen base. Additionally, Servius established several religious festivals, most notably the Compitalia (celebrated in early January each year).
Before we recount the pitiable end of old Servius, let us recap Rome’s status at the end of his reign. Rome had expanded territorially, occupying all Seven of the famous Hills. Her citizenry was divided by wealth, not birth. The Servian Constitution had laid the basis for the Republic that was soon to come. Rome’s geopolitical situation was strong, with alliances secured with the Latin League and the Etruscans. Freedman and poor alike were newly protected and empowered.
Alas, Servius’ humble origins returned to haunt him. I once again defer to Ragan to recount the death of Servius and the ascendency of his successor, Tarquin the Proud (Survey):
Servius’ origin, however, continued to plague him as the Roman aristocracy felt demeaned, being ruled by a former slave. Thus, Servius Tullius married his two daughters, both named Tullia, to two sons (or grandsons) of the former King Tarquin [Tarquinius Priscus]: Tarquin (called Superbus, “the proud, arrogant”) and the younger Arruns. That Servius knew the characters of his daughters and his sons-in-law is shown by his matching. Tullia the Younger, married to Arruns, was as ambitious and conniving as her true love, the man she most admired, Arruns’ younger brother; Tullia the Elder, a devoted, if simple, wife was utterly unlike her conniving, ambitious husband. [i.e the ambitious and conniving Tullia the Younger was married to the simple and devoted Arruns; the simple and devoted Tullia the Elder was married to the ambitious and conniving Tarquinius Superbus. Tullia the Elder pined for Tarquinius Superbus (and vice versa), and was bound to get her way, a marriage from Dante’s Hell; trouble stewed in each couple’s nuptial hours.] Livy puts it rather succinctly: “Two deaths soon followed,” and the surviving Tullia and Tarquin joined in marriage and conspiracy. Working long behind the scenes, when Tarquin decided it was time to act, he boldly went into the Forum to the Curia (Senate House), sat on the royal throne, and proclaimed himself king before the shocked populace. Tullia shamelessly appeared in public and, from her carriage, heralded her husband’s usurpation. Hearing the clamor, old Servius came into the Forum (the Regia, or royal palace, was nearby) and attempted to resist Tarquin. The younger man hurled his father-in-law down the steps and, as he was led home, wounded, sent assassins to finish him off! Livy adds a gruesome touch: As she was coming home in her carriage, Tullia saw the body of her father deserted in the street. She ordered her driver to drive over the body, splattering the carriage with blood, and taking the curse home. The street where this happened was called thereafter Via Scelerata, Street of Crime.
Scandal, shock, scurrility — these were the accoutrements of Tarquinius Superbus’ accession. Where Tarquinius Priscus had pomp and pageantry, Superbus had profligacy and perfidy; where old Numa had decorum and decency, Superbus had depravity and debasedness; and where Romulus had valor and vigor, Superbus had vanity and villainy. The blood splattered on the wheels of Tullia’s cabriolet betokened more than the death of a helpless elder; it presaged the end of a mighty chapter in Rome’s history. The tale of Tarquin the Proud is one of crime for all ages.
Tarquinius Superbus: The Tyrant (r. 535–509 BC)
And so we come to Tarquin the Proud, as all histories of the Roman Kingdom must, the final king of the great house of Tarquin. His cognomen, “Superbus,” (translated as “proud” or “arrogant”) tells all. Ragan aptly characterizes his rule: “That bloody and inauspicious act was only the beginning to what became a despot’s reign of terror. As is the case with all tyrants, no class or individual was spared from Tarquin’s jealousy or cruelty” (Survey). Indeed, so wretched was the rule of Tarquin that he made the title of rex, or king, forever hateful to the Romans, inscribing his name with blood on the tapestry of Roman descent. As Cicero questioned in his Republica, “Are you not aware that it was the insolence and pride of one man, Tarquinius, that made the title of king odious to our people?”
Ambition, wealth, and disregard make a vile combination; Tarquin began his reign with a murderous romp. He refused to entomb old Servius, and executed any senator whom he deemed a “loyalist” supporter of Servius, seizing their property for his own and reducing the size of the Senate. He mustered a bodyguard to facilitate his haughty uninhibitedness. Livy captures his philosophy on governance: “Without hope of his subjects’ affection, he could rule only by fear; and to make himself feared as widely as possible he began the practice of trying capital causes without consultation and by his own sole authority” (Early History of Rome). He ruled as a tyrant rather than as a king, refusing to consult the Senate on any matters of military or state. His proto-Machiavellian foreign policy was just as brutal, as when he summoned a meeting of local leaders and proceeded to execute one (by drowning him to death, no less) under a manufactured charge, a blatant violation of Rome’s notions of justified foreign aggression. He used mercenaries for matters of war, a massive faux-pas in the Roman eye. One particular event recalls his military cruelty, the famous skirmish with Gabii (Ragan, Survey):
Unable to defeat the town of Gabii in battle, Tarquin contrived to have his son pretend that he was fleeing his cruel father — something easily believed. Established in Gabii, Sextus secretly sent to his father asking what to do next. While the messenger awaited, Tarquin silently went into his garden and with his walking stick lopped off the heads of flowers that towered above others. This “object lesson” was not lost on the son; many noble heads were lopped off, and Sextus gained power in Gabii only to hand it over to his father.
In religious matters Tarquin the Proud was equally inept. When the Cumaean Sibyl, a priestess of Apollo, came to Tarquin to offer him nine books of prophecy about the future of Rome (albeit for a hefty sum), he declined. The Sibyl, a crafty saleswoman (who knew!), burned three of the scrolls, and offered the six left for the original price. Tarquin yet again refused — and yet again the Sibyl set three alight, leaving only three from the original nine. Finally, Tarquin paid six thousand talents of silver — an exorbitant sum (about $99 million in today’s prices!) — for a third of the original offering. These books, which came to be known as the Sibylline Books, were housed in the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus and were consulted by the Roman Senate during national emergencies.
Despite its many disasters, the reign of Tarquin the Proud had one area of success: infrastructure. Tarquin, though deranged, understood the mind of the Roman populace; when kept busy, the people had little time to foment discontent. Accordingly, he imported Etruscan engineers and began several massive and lavish construction projects: the Temple of Jupiter and the excavation of the Cloaca Maxima, in particular. Ironically, however, it was the very area in which Tarquin found limited success that effected his downfall: His incredible infrastructure expenditure left the Roman coffers depleted and himself in need of more funds. And so he laid siege to the rich town of Ardea. I once again turn to Ragan for the downfall that followed (Survey):
The end of the Tarquins, and of monarchy at Rome, occurred with a tragic element. Away at a local siege [at Ardea], some young officers, including the king’s son, Sextus, his cousin Tarquinius Collatinus, and a friend, the (supposed) fool Lucius Junius Brutus (his name means “dull”), were one night discussing their wives. Whereas the other men bragged about their wives’ beauty and love of luxury, Collatinus spoke of his wife Lucretia’s great beauty, faithfulness, and diligence in keeping the house — at all hours. Finding this claim hard to imagine, the young men headed back to Rome late at night to find the situation exactly as Collatinus had asserted. Sextus was deeply struck with lust for the beautiful and noble woman. He later returned secretly with a sword to force her to lie with him. When at first she refused, preferring death to dishonor, he threatened further to kill her and leave a dead slave in bed with her. Rather than face public disgrace on herself and her family, the noble woman submitted to her shame. Some time later, overcome with remorse, she confessed the crime to her husband, Brutus, and others [including her father, Spurius Lucius Tricipitinus]. The horror related, she committed suicide in their presence. Aroused to mutiny by such an outrage, Brutus threw off the mask of foolishness he had cultivated to survive under a tyrant, and with many nobles, roused the senate and people against the Tarquins. The king was with the army; when he returned, demanding to be admitted to Rome, the gates were shut in his face, his property was confiscated, and the Tarquins were banished forever. Curiously, Sextus sought refuge in Gabii, where he met a just fate by the people he had betrayed. The exiled Tarquin sought the help of the Etruscan king Lars Porsenna to restore his throne. Failing in his attempt, Tarquin died in exile some ten years later.
And so the Roman Kingdom began and ended with rape: It initiated 241 years prior with the Rape of the Sabine Women, the famous snatching that furnished the hooligan hillpeople known as Romans with women, and it concluded with the famous Rape of Lucretia. Rome was now to be a Republic, ruled by two annually elected magistrates known as consuls.
Thus we conclude our fourth chapter of Roman history. The year is 509 BC, 244 years after her founding in 753, and Rome has entered a new era, the Republic, with two emergent leaders at her helm.

The problem is well-known enough to be a cliche: ancient history is exclusively focused on the lives and perspectives of aristocratic men. Sorting through this bias to recover the stories of other types of people — whether they be lower-class, enslaved, or in my case, female — is an inexact art. But allow me to try it for you. Here are 8 ancient Roman women you should know from history.
A word of caution before I begin: I am using Roman histories and literature here, not archaeological evidence or other ways we have of knowing about the Romans. That means I am filtering through the biases of aristocratic male writers. To the ancient Romans composing the histories, women could be roughly filtered into two categories: good women (wives and mothers who devote their entire beings to the benefit of the interests of their husbands, sons, fathers, etc.) and troublesome women (women who dare to become famous in their own right, and thus must have Something Wrong With Them). A troublesome woman was assumed to fit a certain stereotype: she was a conniving woman trying to use the powerful men in her life to her own ends; she did not observe the proper sexual boundaries (adultery, but also often incest); she killed men with poison (the woman’s murder method as it involved sneaking around and no face-to-face violence). Some of the women on this list will fit the Roman “good woman” mold, but most will be troublesome ones. So Roman writers — already notorious for their problematic relationship with facts — frequently reported rumors as fact or outright lied to make these women fit their stereotype better. Take everything you read about these women (including in this article!) with a healthy grain of salt.
It’s the middle of the second century BCE. New wealth has been pouring into Rome from its recent conquests, from Spain to Carthage to Greece, and tastes among aristocrats are shifting accordingly. The ruling class of Rome used to pride itself on austerity, dressing plainly and maintaining simple lifestyles. But an abundance of foreign gold has tempted the aristocracy into gaudy, Eastern-style displays of wealth. Fine fabrics, gold, and jewels are everywhere.
Cornelia, the daughter of Scipio Africanus (the general whose conquests helped generate all this wealth), is entertaining a friend at home. The friend has just been showing off her jewels to Cornelia, then asks, “What about you? Where are your jewels?”
Cornelia, who is dressed simply despite her wealth, summons her two young sons, Tiberius and Gaius. She smiles serenely as she displays her sons to her friend: “These are my jewels,” Cornelia says.
Cornelia was a paragon of virtue, an example to all Roman women of correct matronly behavior. She was well educated in both Latin and Greek. She was an accomplished writer: she published a set of her letters that were apparently widely read and studied by girls wishing to be as good as her. (These writings, unfortunately and predictably, are long lost.) She was devoted to her sons and remained faithful to her husband even after his early death: Cornelia was an univira, a woman who had had only one husband. She even turned down a marriage proposal from the king of Egypt. (Remarriage after widowhood or divorce was widely accepted and even encouraged, but the Romans reserved a special reverence for a woman who refused it — an univira showed a restraint and devotion to her deceased husband that surpassed even social expectations.)
As I mentioned, Cornelia was the daughter of Scipio Africanus, the vanquisher of Hannibal, who was undoubtably the most important Roman of his age and certainly one of the most consequential in all Roman history. But Cornelia raised her sons with a mission: she wanted them to be so successful that she would be remembered more as their mother than as Scipio’s daughter. This came true, but not in the way she wanted.
Cornelia’s sons, Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus, were Rome’s first populist reformers in centuries. Tiberius became a tribune of the plebs (the voice of the common people) at a time that the office had lost its radical edge. Tiberius brought populist rhetoric back after centuries of aristocratic dominance, demanding land reform to benefit the poor. The aristocracy did not take kindly to the proposition and murdered Tiberius Gracchus. A decade later, his brother Gaius came back with an expanded list of demands and an illegal private army to defend him from his brother’s fate. It took longer, but the aristocracy brought in the actual army and Gaius Gracchus took his own life once his defeat was certain. But the aristocracy could not silence the demands the Gracchi had stirred up. The Gracchi mark the beginning of an era of popular unrest and frequent uprisings, a period that ends with the aristocracy destroying the republic and establishing autocracy. They begin a violent epoch in Roman history that changes the very fabric of Rome.
If Cornelia had any aristocratic reservations about her sons’ political careers, we don’t know it: in public, Cornelia was an energetic supporter of her sons. Remember that, in the Roman view, a good woman supports the men of her family. By supporting her sons’ political ambitions even at the expense of her own social class, Cornelia again shows the Roman ideal of womanhood. Even her own ambition — to be more famous for her sons than for her father — shows the proper sort of ambition for a woman: desire not for her own elevation, but for the success of her menfolk.
Cornelia was both an old-fashioned scion of idealized Roman matronhood and an unusually learned and accomplished woman. She was highly respected in her own time and remains well remembered by history today.
It’s the first century BCE, and a more modern sort of woman is in vogue. The docta puella (“educated girl”) is more independent: she’s witty and worldly, she mingles with poets and philosophers as an equal, she takes lovers without shame. Men write about her love as a revelation, her rejection as the worst imaginable calamity. The docta puella holds a power that is most unladylike.
The foremost of the early doctae puellae was Clodia Metelli. She was a daughter of a heavily distinguished household who became infamous for a pair of affairs: one with a poet who damned her as eagerly as he had praised her, and one with a politician that ended in an accusation of poisoning.
Clodia was descended from one of the noblest families in all of Rome, the gens Claudia — among other famous ancestors was Appius Claudius Caecus, who built the first aqueduct and the most important Roman road, the Via Appia. (Most of the women of the family would have been named Claudia, but Clodia used an alternate spelling of the name that was briefly fashionable in her time.) She was married to Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer, an aristocratic optimate. But when her brother, the infamous populist rabble-rouser Clodius Pulcher, came into political conflict with Metellus Celer, Clodia publicly supported her brother over her husband. This might seem surprising, but though it was mildly scandalous, it was also seen as typical at the time: marriage ties were weaker than ties to natal families, and many Roman women supported brothers and fathers over their husbands.
We can’t know for sure, but we are pretty sure that Clodia was the lover of the poet Catullus whom he called “Lesbia” in his poems. His poetry is the only evidence we have of their relationship, and we can safely say that Catullus’s poetry prioritizes melodrama over factual accuracy. Still, the outlines of the relationship are clear: Catullus was a young upstart poet, Clodia an established, fashionable socialite. He followed her like a puppy, and she kept him around as long as he amused her, then discarded him in favor of other lovers. In a series of poems, Catullus bitterly attacks Clodia and the men he suspects of being her lovers until one begins to wonder what Clodia ever saw in him.
We are certain that Clodia had an affair with Marcus Caelius Rufus, an orator and up-and-coming politician younger than she was. Their relationship ended, and Caelius made his way firmly into political circles that opposed Clodia’s, so in 56 BCE Clodia accused Caelius of trying to poison her at the end of their relationship. Her motivation was political, to tank Caelius’s career and harm his allies — whether there was a grain of truth to the poisoning story is unknowable, but either way, her aim was political, not personal.
In the trial for the alleged poisoning, one of the members of Caelius’s defense team was Cicero, widely considered the greatest of all Roman orators and a longtime political opponent of Clodia’s brother Clodius Pulcher. Each member of the defense team had his own job, and Cicero’s was solely to shred Clodia’s credibility. This tactic would not be allowed in a modern courtroom, but in a Roman one it was fair game. Cicero would augment his colleagues’ claims of Caelius’s innocence with claims of Clodia’s debauchery and wickedness of spirit.
Cicero’s speech (called the Pro Caelio) is a masterwork of invective, and a catalog of Roman insecurities about women in general and doctae puellae in particular. He depicts Clodia as an amoral seducer of younger lovers who bought a house overlooking a bathing spot so she could pick out her victims. He accuses her of poisoning her husband and of having sex with her brother, two ridiculous charges that he knows he can’t prove, so he brings them up through backhanded hints instead of directly. He even assumes the persona of her famous ancestor Appius Claudius to tell her how disappointed he is in her and how she is tarnishing her family’s reputation. It’s a brutal, no-holds-barred takedown. Clodia loses the trial.
Yet we get the smallest hint that Clodia and Cicero didn’t take this political feud personally. In a letter from well after the trial, Cicero mentions speaking with Clodia about buying some land from her. It’s such an offhand, casual mention that it seems that they were on perfectly normal speaking terms. It certainly shows that both continued to move in the same social circles even after the trial. Maybe they were even friendly. It is this detail more than any other that suggests Clodia as an equal to the men of her time: that, just like men in politics, she was perfectly capable of having vitriolic public clashes with someone, then meet them later at a party and leave it behind.
In the end, Clodia was a socialite. She mingled with the men of Rome’s aristocracy as an equal, had affairs at will, involved herself in drama both personal and political, and remained part of her social circles regardless. She was a renowned beauty, an occasional political operator, and the very model of the docta puella.

Clodius Pulcher, like the Gracchi before him, was a populist rabblerouser. He’d risen to power by orchestrating huge amounts of mob violence and had a loyal group of supporters who were about to drive him to higher and better offices. Unfortunately, he has just been undone by the very force that created him: his gang and one led by a rival named Milo clashed in the road just outside Rome, and Clodius has been murdered. It’s 52 BCE, and Rome is at a crossroads.
Clodius’s supporters have brought his body to his widow, Fulvia, who cries publicly in her doorway. According to ritual and tradition, these should be her next steps: Fulvia needs to have the body cleaned and dressed, then leave it lying in the atrium so visitors can pay their respects before the funeral. Then in a few days, she must gather the family for a funeral procession through the city, which will include representations of Clodius’s famous ancestors (of which he has very many — see the description of his sister Clodia’s family above). The procession will stop at the Forum, where a distinguished male family member or friend will give a funeral oration in her husband’s honor. Then all will proceed to the family tomb outside the city walls, where the body will be cremated and placed in an urn inside the mausoleum. This is the procedure, and though it can be fraught with emotion, it is orderly and time-honored.
Fulvia does not do this.
She allows Clodius’s supporters to take his body, still broken and mangled by the street fight that killed him, directly to the Forum. There they lay him on the Rostra and give his impromptu funeral oration — mere hours after his death instead of days — in a way that whips the common people into a frenzy at the loss of their hero. The mob takes Clodius’s body and decides to cremate it on the spot, but by tradition all crematoria are outside the city walls. So they use the Senate house instead. The Curia Hostilia, the senate’s meeting place for at least 500 years, burns to the ground.
It is a horrifying parody of a Roman funeral. Fulvia at least allowed it to happen, and quite likely encouraged it — it was the role of a good Roman wife to enhance the legacy of her husband, and Fulvia was consistently a funhouse-mirror version of the good Roman wife.
In the aftermath of Clodius’s funeral, Milo goes on trial for his murder, and even a court stacked with his allies knows better than to acquit him in the face of such popular unrest. Cicero doesn’t even risk giving the defense speech he’s written for the occasion. The burning of the Senate house was a message no one could ignore, and the Senate takes immediate steps to bring back stability. The march toward a civil war that will destroy the republic continues — and this isn’t the last role Fulvia will play in it.
Fulvia was married three times, all of her husbands ill-fated. Her first, Clodius, was the most successful populist politician in all of Roman history, until he very much wasn’t. Her second, Curio, had been a close ally of Clodius during his life and inherited Clodius’s supporters. Curio, however, didn’t have the reformist spirit of Clodius — he threw in his lot with Julius Caesar, and died in Africa during Caesar’s civil war. We hear nothing about Fulvia in this period. It is Fulvia’s third husband who will throw her back into the public spotlight almost a decade after Clodius’s death — another partisan of Caesar named Mark Antony.
In the aftermath of Caesar’s murder, Antony is one of few men in a position to try to seize his supporters and become the next Caesar. The next decade is chaos, with alliances and rivalries shifting constantly. Antony’s most consequential sometime-ally-sometime-rival is Octavian, the great-nephew and official heir of Caesar. Octavian is much younger than Antony and has no military experience while Antony is a seasoned and respected general. But Octavian has something Antony never does: he is an incredible propagandist.
Fulvia first enters Octavian’s propaganda by way of Cicero, who attacks Antony in a blistering set of speeches called the Philippics during a period of hostility between Antony and Octavian. As Clodius’s old enemy, Cicero can’t resist also attacking Fulvia, wife of Antony and widow of Clodius. He calls her a deadly thing that has destroyed both her previous husbands and is about to destroy her third. He simultaneously questions Antony’s morality by bringing up his many affairs and paints Fulvia as a controlling woman whom Antony slavishly obeys.
Fulvia’s response to Cicero’s attacks is emblematic of the actions of a Roman politician’s wife. Since Antony is away in the East and unable to respond, Fulvia circulates the city with Antony’s mother, meeting with senators and solidifying alliances that would protect her husband. Wives were the original lobbyists — prominent Roman men relied on their wives to set up their social calendars in ways that would further their careers, and when they were out of the city, their wives were among their most important advocates. Some accounts have Fulvia falling at the feet of senators and weeping to convince them to spare her husband. She is successful.
Soon, the rift between Antony and Octavian is brushed away in favor of a renewed alliance — and a proscription list. Proscription is a method of sanctioning political murders; Antony and Octavian offer rewards for killing their political enemies, then use the resources of the dead to fund their war on the conspirators who killed Caesar. Since Cicero attacked Antony, he makes it onto Antony’s list, and Octavian does not object. Cicero is murdered while fleeing the city. Many wish to see Fulvia’s hand in this murder: she exacts delayed revenge on behalf of her first husband Clodius (who had been Cicero’s staunchest opponent), and on her own behalf after Cicero dragged her name through the muck. But Cicero was at least as much Antony’s enemy as he was Fulvia’s, and the Philippics had been much crueler to him than to her. Still, the legend goes that Fulvia took out her hairpins and stabbed the tongue on Cicero’s severed head.
As I mentioned, Antony spent much of this period in the East, while Octavian kept firm control of Rome in the West. Fulvia stayed in Rome, putting her (again) in the position of defending Antony’s interests in his absence — even as he infamously had very public affairs with a Cappadocian princess named Glaphyra, then with the Egyptian queen Cleopatra. Inevitably, Octavian turned against Antony again, and Antony dithered about his reply. But Fulvia felt no need to wait for him.
In 41 BCE, Fulvia allied with Antony’s brother, Lucius Antonius, to raise an army and oppose Octavian. She helped raise troops, an atypical role for a woman to play. But her involvement proved helpful to Octavian’s propaganda: he painted the rebellion as the work of Antony’s out-of-control wife, who was just jealous because her husband was sleeping with other women. He said Fulvia had strapped on a sword and armor and led troops herself (which she almost certainly did not do, to my everlasting disappointment, because I adore this image for all the same reasons Octavian hated it). It fit well with Cicero’s earlier characterization of Antony as weak and controlled by women, and would transfer well to Octavian’s later war against Antony and his lover Cleopatra. We still have to contend with Octavian’s exaggerated image of Fulvia when we consider her, because his messaging was very successful — it has made a larger impact on history than Fulvia herself ever did. Octavian’s soldiers even inscribed sling bullets with sexual insults aimed at Fulvia before lobbing them at her and Lucius’s troops — in the propaganda war, this battle was Octavian vs. Fulvia, not Octavian vs. Lucius Antonius or Antony himself.
Lucius Antonius and Fulvia lost their battle in the Italian town of Perusia. (The incident would be called the Perusine War after this town.) Mark Antony disavowed the entire incident, and Octavian viewed his shaky alliance as worth maintaining, so he exiled Lucius and Fulvia instead of having them executed. Fulvia went to Athens to reunite briefly with Antony, but she died of an illness not long afterward. She did not live to see Antony and Cleopatra become so close they might as well have been married, or their unsuccessful last stand in 31 BCE against Octavian, the future Emperor Augustus.
Fulvia’s legacy is complicated. She was certainly politically savvy and capable, but as much as she did not fear to flout convention, everything she did was in service of her husbands’ interests. Ultimately, there is much about her that is unknowable. Clodius and Antony were on the losing sides of their conflicts, so everything we know about her is filtered through a hostile lens; we can trust no surviving characterizations of her. This, I think, is one of Fulvia’s most fascinating aspects: we know what she did, but nothing about what she thought or how she was. Though she is often held up as the quintessential Roman troublesome woman, the real Fulvia is an enigma.
Hortensia was a female orator who spoke against a plan by the Second Triumvirate to tax noblewomen. We don’t know much about her aside from this one act, but she won great respect in oratory, a domain the Romans considered male-only.
Hortensia was the daughter of Quintus Hortensius, an illustrious orator and rival to Cicero. The backdrop for Hortensia’s speech was the civil war that destroyed the Republic, the same one that Fulvia participated in. After decades of fighting, the war chests were growing empty. Octavian, Mark Antony, and Lepidus, the Second Triumvirate, proscribed their political rivals to raise money through their wealth (the proscription list that killed Cicero), but even that wasn’t enough. So in 42 BCE, they came up with a plan to tax the 1,400 wealthiest women in Rome.
Laws targeting women in wartime had a history in Rome: during the Second Punic War two centuries earlier, huge defeats by Hannibal led to the Lex Oppia, which limited women’s wealth. The justification was that wealthy men had to contribute to war by fighting, so wealthy women had to pull their weight by paying. In the case of the Lex Oppia, there was also an unstated reason: anxiety over women holding the wealth of Roman society. The Roman aristocracy had been gutted by the disastrous victories of Hannibal of Carthage. For the first time, huge numbers of widows were inheriting their husbands’ estates. Roman moralists panicked, and the senate acted to “protect” the fortunes of the great families from capricious women.
In the case of the Triumvirate’s proposal, the motivation was political: just as in the Punic War, the wealthy women who would be taxed were widows. Most of the widows of the aristocracy were produced by their husbands’ deaths in the civil wars — thus, taxing widows was a way of draining their political enemies’ funds posthumously.
A group of noblewomen led by Hortensia appeared before the Triumvirate to argue the injustice of the proposed tax. No authentic account of her speech survives. The Greek historian Appian, writing a century later, presents a version of her speech produced by his own imagination — this speech includes the jarringly modern argument that women were being taxed for a war that they had no say in, because they could not vote or hold public office. In other words, an ancient Roman (Greek?) version of a suffrage argument, or perhaps no taxation without representation. What the real Hortensia said is a mystery, but we hear glowing reviews from various ancient writers who did have access to the text. She was said to have resurrected the oratorical greatness of her father.
The Triumvirate tried to usher the women off the speaker’s platform, but the crowd rebelled. In the end, they reduced the list of women to be taxed to 400 and looked for other sources of revenue. Hortensia’s speech was a partial success.
Hortensia’s story isn’t as extensive as some of the other women’s on this list, but she was certainly a woman who took ownership of an issue. She stepped out of the traditional woman’s role in Rome and into the spotlight of politics, however briefly — and unlike of the most women who did so, she won respect instead of condemnation.
Sulpicia is a true rarity: a female Roman poet. We know of a few poetesses from Roman times (one of whom, hilariously, is a Silver Age poet also named Sulpicia). But only the Sulpicia of the first century CE has a body of poems still in existence today. So what can our lone surviving female Roman poet tell us?
Sulpicia was a docta puella from a literary family: her grandfather was Servius Sulpicius Rufus, whom Cicero called the greatest orator he’d ever heard, and the uncle who raised her was the literary patron who launched the career of Ovid. It’s no surprise she became a writer. Her oeuvre is short, six poems totaling 40 lines together. Her complete collected works fit comfortably on one sheet of paper. They are elegiac poems, a Roman genre of passionate poems addressed to (usually fickle) lovers. She writes about a pseudonymous lover named Cerinthus — her love for him, and the pain caused by both of their missteps and by other people pulling them apart. She takes on the voice of an emotional teenage girl, pouting at her uncle as he plans an inconvenient family trip, cursing herself for missteps in communication with her lover, and wrestling with questions about her identity and place in society.
For centuries, Sulpicia’s poems were not recognized as hers. They were preserved in a manuscript of Tibullus and assumed to be his. Scholarship showed her authorship in the 1800s, but for the next century, she was regarded only as a curiosity. Scholars said her poems lacked refinement, that she was a passionate, emotional amateur who didn’t merit serious study. (Gee, I wonder if her gender had anything to do with these assessments.) Only in the 1970s did scholars start to take a closer look, strip away the prejudices of the past, and begin to appreciate the talent and erudition underlying Sulpicia’s poetry.
But even if those old-fashioned scholars had been right about her, Sulpicia would still offer us something no other Roman poet can. Much Roman ink was spilled writing about men chasing after doctae puellae, but in Sulpicia’s case, the docta puella herself speaks. She has much to say about identity and social respectability from a woman’s viewpoint. Although Sulpicia’s work is not extensive and does not touch on many of the subjects we would love to know about through her eyes, still, she is an authentic female Roman voice — one of very few we still have access to — and thus can help us make up for some of the bothersome blind spots in our study of the Roman experience.

Livia Drusilla was the wife of Augustus and first empress of Rome — it can be fairly said that she set the expectations for all empresses after her. She was a close advisor and confidant of the emperor and was thus heavily involved in politics. But unlike Fulvia, she kept herself rigidly within the acceptable social boundaries set for Roman women, so her public image during her lifetime was much more positive. After her death, however, it turns out that no amount of piety can satisfy the writers of history, because she gets accused of being a conniving murderer in equal measure with her more scandalous peers.
Livia was the third wife of Augustus (the former Octavian), but seems to have been the first one he married for love rather than alliance-building. They were both married to other people when they met, and Augustus was immediately smitten. He divorced his wife Scribonia on the same day she gave birth to their daughter, and compelled Livia’s husband, Tiberius Claudius Nero, to divorce her even though she was six months pregnant with their second child. Augustus and Livia married immediately, and Livia’s ex-husband gave her away at the wedding ceremony as if he were the father of the bride. This was in 38 BCE, after the future Augustus defeated Fulvia at Perusia but before he defeated Antony and Cleopatra.
Augustus and Livia then had a happy 51-year marriage. Livia was just as careful in presenting her public image as her husband always was: she was depicted consistently as a chaste, modest, religiously reverent matron. She never produced children for him (their only pregnancy ended in stillbirth), which many Roman men would have responded to with divorce. But Augustus’s affection for Livia never seemed to diminish. According to Suetonius, Augustus kept notes throughout the day of things he meant to tell her so he wouldn’t forget anything when he saw her (which is the hardest I have ever liked or related to that slimy bastard).
It is ironic that Livia never had children with Augustus, because Augustus passed a slate of morality laws to reward women for childbearing in an effort to improve the aristocratic birthrate. The era of Augustus is a time of re-traditionalizing after the time of the docta puella — adultery was criminalized, and women were granted certain civil rights as long as they had enough children. The Roman nobility pulled its wives and daughters back out of the public eye, and Augustus led the charge. His wife was presented as the ideal matron in public. The fact that she filled this role for him without giving him an heir is a testament that their love was real and important to him.
Still, Livia was accused by later historians of engineering the deaths of Augustus’s relatives — and even of poisoning Augustus himself — in order that her own son might become his heir. It is true that Augustus lost a lot of heirs before reluctantly adopting Livia’s son by her first husband, who became the second emperor, Tiberius. But modern historians reject the idea that this was Livia’s doing. It’s a bit of slander that doesn’t fit well with everything else we know about her, especially the fact that she was never as close to her son Tiberius as she was to her husband. If you’re looking for an empress willing to murder her husband for the advancement of her son, look further down the list — Livia’s not your girl, but Agrippina is on her way.
After Augustus’s death of natural causes (no poison needed), Livia retained enormous influence as Augusta, the widow of a god. She clashed with her son, who had no desire to share power with his mother. Even as her real influence dwindled, she enjoyed the ceremony and honor her status afforded her. She died in 29 CE, 15 years after her husband, and her son Tiberius vetoed the order Augustus had left behind that Livia be deified upon her death. 13 years later, her grandson, the fourth emperor Claudius, restored all her honors and made her a god, Diva Augusta.
The age of Augustus brought a re-traditionalizing of Roman womanhood after the age of the docta puella, and Livia Drusilla was the posterchild of the proper imperial matron. Her marriage is a rare case of a happy marriage in the imperial household, and she garnered enough public respect to be honored as a god after her death.
Agrippina was another empress, the wife of the fourth emperor Claudius and the mother of the fifth emperor Nero. Like Fulvia, Agrippina is depicted in ancient histories as a scheming woman intent on exercising power through powerful men — and unlike Fulvia, Agrippina seems to have deserved this reputation. Her story is a soap opera that involves the murder of her husband and her own murder by her son in some real Looney Tunes shenanigans.
Agrippina was a member of the Julio-Claudian family tree, which is impossibly full of cousin marriages and adoptions — she’s related to just about anyone you can name from this period. She was the daughter of Agrippina the Elder (the well-respected granddaughter of Augustus) and Germanicus (a beloved general who was Tiberius’s heir until his own untimely death). When Tiberius died in 37 CE, it was Agrippina’s brother Caligula who took over.
Caligula’s reign is infamous, as is his relationship with his three sisters — he was very close to them and heaped public honors on them. (Several ancient sources say that Caligula committed incest with his sisters, but this is just slander and not at all likely to be true.) The relationship soured when Caligula’s favorite sister, Drusilla, died. The other two sisters fell out of favor, and Agrippina became wrapped up in palace intrigue and possibly an assassination plot. She was forced to carry the ashes of her executed brother-in-law (an alleged co-conspirator) in his funeral procession, then was exiled from Rome.
After Caligula’s assassination a few years later, his uncle Claudius took the throne and invited his exiled relatives back. Claudius had a reputation as a weak man pushed around by freedmen and women, especially his wife, Messalina. After allegedly scheming to overthrow Claudius, Messalina was executed, and Claudius began to think about taking a new wife. He chose Agrippina (now a widow twice over with one son), possibly as a way to make peace between the feuding Julian and Claudian branches of the family. They had to get special permission from the senate to marry because Agrippina was Claudius’s niece — ick.
As empress, Agrippina exerted huge influence, pursuing and killing personal enemies and piling honors on herself and her son. She persuaded Claudius to adopt her son, who took the name Nero — bafflingly, this meant Claudius gave Nero precedence over his own son, Britannicus, who was a few years younger. But apparently Claudius began to get wise and to prepare to distance himself from Agrippina and Nero. So Agrippina enlisted the support of the palace poisoner, a woman named Locusta (“lobster”) — yes, the imperial palace was the sort of place to employ a poisoner. With Locusta’s help, Agrippina killed Claudius by poisoning his mushrooms at a feast. Her son Nero remained his heir.
When Nero took the throne in 54 CE, his mother Agrippina kept a tight leash on him. She put his praetorian commander Burrus and his tutor Seneca the Younger in charge and publicly honored herself as nearly a co-ruler. Nero began to rebel, so Agrippina signaled that she might start to favor Claudius’s son Britannicus as his replacement. In response, Nero poisoned Britannicus at dinner just as Agrippina had Claudius. Picture the scene: Britannicus takes a sip of his wine (Nero put the poison into the snow used to cool wine instead of the wine itself to evade the food tasters) and drops dead immediately (Locusta had advised a slow-acting poison, but Nero had insisted on a fast one that would be obvious). His mother and all his advisers know what he has just done, but Nero says that Britannicus is only having an epileptic fit and will soon recover. The household is forced to finish their dinner with the teenager’s corpse still at the table. Nero wanted to deliver a message to his mother, and he certainly succeeded.
A few years of rising tensions later, Nero threw Agrippina out of the imperial palace. As he prepared to escape from under the thumb of the advisors she’d assigned him and start ruling for himself, he decided he should kill her too. So he offered her the use of one of his boats for a pleasure cruise to the resort town of Baiae. He had the boat rigged to sink, and had a trick awning built that could be triggered to fall on his mother and weigh her down to the deck so she couldn’t escape the sinking ship. Like I said in the introduction — Looney Tunes shenanigans. But Agrippina is the Roadrunner in this scenario: she wrestled her way free of the awning and swam to shore. Nero decided the time for subtlety was over and simply sent soldiers to her house to murder her.
Agrippina was a cunning, ambitious woman with the same lack of scruples as the men in her family. She was the great-granddaughter, adopted granddaughter, sister, wife, and mother respectively of the five Julio-Claudian emperors. She murdered her husband with poisoned mushrooms only to be murdered in turn by the son she’d put on the throne — no one can say she didn’t know the game she was playing.
There are many empresses who came after Agrippina and similarly played political games as wives and mothers, most notably the many Julias of the Severan Dynasty — perhaps if I ever write a sequel to this article, I’ll cover them. For now, I’d like to take you forward a few centuries…
Honoria was an empress of sorts in the early 5th century CE, just before the fall of the western empire — and indeed there is an old-fashioned tradition of blaming her for the Fall of Rome itself. The Rome Honoria inhabited was very different from the Rome of all the other women on this list; one might even consider it an entirely separate society. But the woman who couldn’t follow a vow of chastity so hard she might have sent a marriage proposal to Attila the Hun about it certainly deserves a spot on this list.
Honoria was the daughter of short-lived emperor Constantius III and Galla Placidia, another woman who merits discussion. Placidia, the sister of emperor Honorius, was taken as a prisoner of war in the 410 CE sack of Rome by the Visigoths. When relations improved between the Goths and Honorius, the Gothic leader Ataulf married Placidia in 414 to cement a Romano-Gothic alliance. But relations soured again, and after her Gothic husband’s overthrow, Placidia returned to Rome as part of a peace treaty, where her brother married her off to a general who later became his co-emperor Constantius III.
Placidia had three children, including Honoria, who would have been a young child for much of what followed: Placidia’s husband Constantius III died, Placidia fell out with Emperor Honorius, and the family fled to Constantinople. A few short years later Honorius died, leaving a power vacuum in Rome, and Placidia and her children returned to join the dynastic struggle. In 425 CE, Placidia had her young son set up as the emperor Valententian III, and she became his regent, as no one expected a five-year-old to rule. Placidia held effective power as Augusta for the next 25 years.
Placidia gave the title Augusta to her daughter, presumably so she could help as regent if Placidia herself became unable for any reason. But centuries of dynastic struggle made late imperial households take some extreme measures: as Augusta, Honoria had to take a vow of chastity so that she wouldn’t produce any heirs to challenge the legitimacy of her emperor brother. She found this difficult when she matured, and became pregnant by a palace official. (Honoria’s chronology isn’t easy to pin down, but I think she was in her 20s or 30s at this point.) Her mother took away her title, executed her lover, and had her engaged to a middling senator with no ambition as a way of disarming her.
Stripped of power and prestige, Honoria chafed. She had been raised by a powerful imperial woman and expected the same life for herself. And so in 449 CE, Honoria sent a request for help — along with her engagement ring — to Attila the Hun. She offered him the western empire if he would extract her from her terrible engagement.
The infamous Attila had been threatening both halves of the Roman empire for some years now, but had not yet dared to make an all-out attack. Now he had received a plea and a ring from the sister of the western emperor — whether Honoria had actually meant her gesture as a marriage proposal is unclear, but Attila chose to interpret it that way, seizing on her request for help as a pretense to invade and a marriage alliance as a possible way to hang onto Rome once he took it. He announced his intention to march on Rome and claim his bride.
Emperor Valentinian III exiled his sister Honoria — only the influence of their mother Galla Placidia stopped him from executing her — and had to fight the Huns in Italy in the early 450s. But Attila never took Rome or claimed his Roman bride. Though he won all his battles in Italy, external forces pulled him east again, and he died shortly thereafter.
Nothing is known of Honoria’s life after this incident. There is some evidence to suggest that she was dead six years later, in 455, but we cannot be sure — she either died young or disappeared into obscurity.
Historians looking for a sensational story have sometimes pointed to Honoria inviting Attila the Hun to attack Rome as the cause of the final fall of the west, but the connection between those events is tenuous at best. That would imply that Attila was a primary cause of the fall, which is not a very solid argument. Attila, and by extension Honoria, merely contributed to the chaos swallowing the western empire at this time; they did not cause it.
Still, the story of an imperial woman so insulted at having been removed from power that she proposed an alliance (and possibly a marriage) with one of the most infamous so-called “barbarians” of all time to regain it… it’s a doozy, even if it didn’t actually destroy the empire. We can thank Honoria for one of the wildest, most soap-opera-like turns in late Roman history.
Socialites, schemers, pious wives, treacherous empresses — these eight women show a range of ways an upper-class woman could penetrate the male-centric bias of ancient historians and be recorded, however imperfectly, in their annals. My goal was to focus on Roman women who appear in the histories (with one sidebar into literature), which means this list is not intersectional: the lives of lower-class and slave women are more difficult to recover, though no less worthy of the effort.
These eight women represent a variety of ways in which women were received in their own time, from admiration to horror, from crediting them for making a difference to blaming them for the fall of society. A Roman woman was expected to support her family in public, but was routinely punished if she became too visible. The experience of being a woman was, perhaps, not as different from today as we might expect.
So tell me… which Roman women have I missed? Who should I cover in part 2?

“Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble Ancient footprints are everywhere You can almost think that you’re seein’ double On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs”- Bob Dylan, When I Paint My Masterpiece
How often do I think about the Roman Empire?
As a brown South Asian man, not much. I see the Roman Empire as a distant blip- a collection of bedtime stories featuring tales of valour, romance, betrayal, political intrigue, and war. However, when surrounded by the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, and the Colosseum, its hard not to think about the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire is inseparable from the life of the average present-day resident of Rome. The construction of the Rome Metro Line was repeatedly interrupted because every time they dug underground, they found Roman ruins. The average Italian’s regular Rome commute on the metro disobeys conventional underground train urban planning as it zigzags across the city to avoid running through Roman artifacts. The average Italian in Rome also disdains at the bumbling, clueless tourists who block the glorious Vespa’s right-of-way on the road. While the Roman Empire expanded outward from within like an amoeba conquering everything in its path, modern Rome is being conquered by tourists from without. And the reason for the tourist invasion? The gargantuan Roman artifacts that are interspersed with the average neighborhood in Rome. And of course, the food.
The word ‘romance’ comes from the old French word ‘romanz’ referring to the act of speaking in the old vernacular, more Latinized French. Romanz referred to a bygone era where Latin was the lingua franca during the Roman Empire. Stories written in the vernacular- or romanz- were action packed, chivalric, and medieval. Think Shrek, but less self-aware. These tales involved medieval knights setting off on Herculean adventures, slaying beasts, sparring with Barbarians, and winning a lucky maiden’s hand in marriage. These tales were a glimpse into the imagination of a person in the Middle Ages. It was a mythical adoration and idealization of a bygone Roman era which would be reminisced for centuries to come. The hero undertaking life threatening trials and tribulations to win the love of a beautiful maiden would- in this context- be romantic (i.e. imbued with the characteristics of a Roman). The ethos of Rome is giving Paris a serious run for its money in the title battle for The City of Love.
Another area where Rome gives Paris a run for its money is the food. We’ve all had a croissant- the flaky, soft package of buttery goodness that takes on a velvety texture when dipped in a cappuccino. The croissant is quintessentially French. Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite may well be the core values of the French Republic, but the word Croissant can be added to the end of that verbiage to include another aspect of what is core to being French. But what if I told you that there is a better alternative to the croissant- an alternative that we’ve all ignored over the last few centuries? Enter the cornetto, a larger, flakier, butter-ier, velvet-ier alternative to the croissant which comes filled with varieties of cream- usually, Pistachio, Chocolate or Custard. If you walk opposite to the direction of the teeming hoardes of tourists in Rome, you’ll come across local Pasticcerias- local pastry shops- selling cheap cornettos out of holes in walls. Italians line up around the block to collect their daily dose of cappuccino and cornetto right before their morning commute. The combination creates an essential fuel for today’s Roman, providing them with mental acuity and patience to tolerate bumbling tourists that block the roadways. One such hole-in-the-wall is the Roscioli Café Pasticceria- an iconic establishment that is always full, busy and teeming with Italians. One bite into Roscioli’s famous tent-pole pistachio cornetto expands the boundaries of what your mind thought was possible- the flaky, buttery, velvety soft texture of the cappuccino infused pastry is bombarded with the nutty, creamy, smooth, hearty textures of the pistachio crema. Now compare that with the croissant- a heap of flaky pastry that falls apart at the smallest touch. I will never see the croissant the same way again. The French have monopolized our consciousness and successfully convinced us of the superiority of their cuisine. Try one pistachio cornetto, and you’ll realize that a croissant is a middle-of-the-road bland husk of carbohydrates, or as the French like to say- merde.
Similar to the croissant, the pizza that you’ve been eating all your life is a lie. Pizza, once the pride of Italy, has been bastardized and appropriated by the Americans (as with all foods), and elevated to a sort of quintessentially American experience. The Pizza we eat today is what the American capitalist machine has forcefully shoved down our throats- a slab of chewy, overcooked dough, topped with excessively saucy and drippy tomaytuh sowuhss, complimented by an indistinguishable rapidly melting slop of mozzarella cheese made in a factory being operated by some poor bloke working minimum wage to mass produce a cheese purpose-built for the fastest melt rather than the best flavor. American pizza is not made with love, it’s made to suit the convenience of Americans- mass produced, characterless slop served quick and cheap, ready to reheat and eaten on the go in a Ford F-150. Italians take offense to the idea of New York Pizza. Even more offensive, are the Detroit Style and Chicago pizzas.
Romans have been consuming pizzas for centuries. Originated as a flat piece of dough topped with meat, vegetables and other accouterments during the Roman Empire, the pizza has mass appeal across cultures- take for example, the lahmacun in Turkey, the pide in the Levant, the mana’kish in the Gulf. The ancient recipe was simple- no frills, with no tomato sauce or melted cheese, providing for the best way for ancient Romans to gain energy on their long conquests, whilst maximizing flavor. Tomatoes eventually made their way into Italy in the 18th Century as a new world crop- “discovered” by Spanish conquistadors in their conquest of Latin America and brought back to Europe. And so began the tomato sauce fad. Look closely at regional pizza variations, and one will notice that pizzas in Naples almost entirely comprise a layer of tomato sauce on the dough. Meanwhile, Pizzas sold by decades old vendors in Rome include the original, sauce-less variations. While Naples does indisputably take credit for being the originator of the Pizza, there is an argument to be made that vendors in Rome remained true to the Pizza’s original tomato sauce-less form. One such Roman vendor is the famous Roscioli Antico Forno (different Roscioli this time).
Roscioli’s pizza, a very archetypal Roman kind- it’s flat, crispy, and served by the slice in rectangular form. Roscioli’s pizzas vary with the tomato sauce and non-sauce variations alike, producing variations that people travel across the world for. Their most popular pizza slice is the pizza bianca- or White Pizza. While the white pizzas sold at the large American chains usually replace tomato sauce with a regurgitated toxic sludge of a bechamel that fails to obey Newtonian fluid dynamics, Roscioli’s is without a sauce- leaving the white (or bianca) base exposed like a blank canvas ripe for culinary experimentation. Their dough- a treasured family secret- does all the heavy lifting. It’s crispy and flaky, whilst being flat with the right amount of give required for the perfect chew. Their variations include one that’s topped with potatoes, olive oil, salsiccia (Italian sausage) and rosemary creating a simple yet delicious slice that’s dripping with olive oil and can be eaten on-the-go. Another pizza variation famous in Rome, is the Pizza Marinara, reproduced best by another locally respected establishment- Pizza alla Palla.
Pizza alla Palla is tucked away into one of Rome’s back alleys within a quaint residential area. You will almost hear zero English spoken within a 500-metre radius of this establishment. It’s operating space is so tiny, that it can only fit 4 to 5 diners at once. The limited seating space is not a concern to their patrons, as the pizzas fly out from behind the counter in white paper bags to be quickly engorged on by a hungry Roman while they go on to conquer the Roman streets in their crusade against pedestrians and tourists. Pizza alla Palla’s pizzas- like most Roman pizza shops- lay behind a glass wall and are illuminated by bright yellow, fluorescent lights to contrast the bright reds of the sauce.
The Pizza Marinara, is a thought experiment on what Pizza would look like without cheese. While we’ve grown up eating cheesy pizza from American establishments our whole lives, the Romans have been eating Pizza without melted cheese for more than two centuries. Unlike with Roscioli, Pizza alla Palla’s pizza is carried by the sauce. My favourite variation on the marinara was a slice with anchovies, capers, olives and fresh burrata. The saltiness of the anchovies and olives when combined with the tartness of the capers and tomato sauce reinforce the hearty, fatty, and fresh burrata creating the ultimate flavour bomb that one can reminisce for years. If anchovies on pizza isn’t your cup of tea, then I suggest you go for local artisanal vendor Pizza Hut’s artful, hand-crafted, oven baked Pizza Margherita with a tomato sauce so generic that it may as well be copyrighted by Toronto based rapper Drake, accompanied by a cheese topping identical to a radioactive toxic sludge that makes Chernobyl look like a kiddie-pool.
Similar to Rome’s pizza, Rome’s pasta are quite unique and under-explored as well. The 4 pastas indigenous to Rome are: The Cacio E Pepe (Cheese and Pepper), Carbonara, Amatriciana and alla Gricia. What all these dishes have in common is the heavy-handed use of pepper to create nutty, mildly spicy notes to contrast with the fat of the cheese and guanciale (Pork jowl). Guanciale- a slab of fatty pork meat- is heavily used in the Carbonara, Amatriciana and alla Gricia and its fat often serves as a starting base for the sauces. Carbonara adds egg to this fat, Amatriciana adds tomato sauce and alla Gricia adds cheese, creating a holy trinity of Roman fat-based pasta sauces. The most common of these outside of Italy is the Carbonara, almost universally bastardized through the extra addition of cream, bacon and emulsifying agents. The universalization of American Italian food through mass production and the prevalence of American cultural exports everywhere has forced us to accept mediocre dishes as the standard. These dishes use old, chewy bacon instead of guanciale; salty, starchy, powdery parmesan with a texture similar to a social lubricant ubiquitous on Wall Street; store brought dried, chewy pasta as a vehicle for the sauce; and most importantly, xanthan gum to lend the pasta cohesion in order to hide the underpaid, overworked chef’s lack of skill in emulsifying pasta sauces.
Do yourself a favour and seek out a local Italian establishment- one that uses guanciale in the carbonara- and taste the difference between an actual carbonara and what you’ve assumed is a carbonara for your entire life. As one famous quote goes, “mediocrity is a sin”- or as I transliterate it to “never settle for a pasta that uses shit ingredients”. Local pasta in Rome is cheap, fresh, and even healthy given the average 10k steps-a-day mileage for the average commuter. To find the best, bang-for-buck establishments frequented by local patrons, ask the cab drivers for where they would eat. Or even go in the opposite direction to the tourist hivemind, and maybe then you’ll actually experience some local culture.
Walk down any Roman street, and you’ll find small, quaint trattorias selling suppli- a gooey, cheesy ball of leftover risotto or pasta that is doused in egg, coated with breadcrumbs and deep fried. You’ll find this everywhere in Rome. But it is often overlooked by small-minded tourists who conceptualize Italian food as pizza and pasta. Supplis (not to be confused with the Southern Arancini) are a small snack that are a cultural equivalent of a samosa- eaten either as an appetizer or between meals to satiate one’s appetite. Suppli can be quite intoxicating, addictive and pair well with local beer creating the ideal bitter and salty-savoury combination that hits the right spot at 2 am on a Thursday night.
We think we know Italian food. But we don’t. There are so many cultural variations and dishes that we’ve never tried, and that we’ll probably never try. Most of these dishes never make it out of Italy because Americans haven’t yet found an efficient way to ruin them yet. To go to Italy, and look for an Alfredo with grilled chicken on menus while committing the cardinal sin of asking the waiter for chilli flakes to spice your pasta is a disservice to the centuries old Italian culture that has tried, tested and perfected their foods. If you’ve ordered chilli flakes or chilli oil (as most Indians I know) at an Italian restaurant, you probably don’t deserve to go to Italy. Respect the local culture, appreciate it for what it is, and please, do NOT make the whole table wait while you immaculately position the dishes for your Instagram story. Not only are you upsetting everyone at the table, you’re also upsetting the Italians. Their dishes don’t need your Instagram story to popularize them. They’ve already refined their cuisine over centuries of experimentation.
My short, 36-hour Rome stay was eventful- I explored virtually all of Rome on foot, resorting to public transport only when necessary. I’ve tried everything Rome has on platter- the gelatos, the Pizzas, the Suppli, the Pastas, the coffee, the pistachio cornetto. But there is still a lot left to see- Italy is not just Rome, Venice or Milan. Italy is Sicily, Naples, Emilia-Romagna, Calibria, Lombardy, Tuscany, and so much more. To say, that I know Italian food is an injustice to Italy. I, on the other hand, can affirm that I know Rome, and I hope that perhaps one day, I will know Italy.
There is a saying in Rome: “The Milanese eat to live. Us Romans, on the other hand, live to eat.” The Roman experience is derived from the food. And perhaps, there is no Rome without its food- so the Roman Empire hasn’t completely died out. Its legacy lives on through its flavours, ingredients and culinary pastiches. The Roman sculptures look on as the centuries pass by. Empires come and go, and with it, the foreigners that visit Rome to witness the greatest city ever built. Neighborhoods, metro-lines, bus routes and office buildings are continuously built and destroyed on top of the ruins of an ancient, great civilization. Rome has always been in a churn of creative destruction. And all that remains- and all that will ever remain- is the food, sculptures and the Roman sun.

Part I
One of my clients, Chad Fuentes, recently said something that stayed with me:
“I feel like sometimes we romanticize the past and put undue praise on characters or people from that past, while holding the people supporting us in the present to an unfair standard.”
Yes. There’s truth in that.
I had been reflecting on something similar while watching a speech from one of our national leaders — perhaps the President addressing Congress or the Senate. I can’t recall the exact details, but the image was clear: the structure, the solemnity, the way history lives and breathes through these halls. And I found myself thinking, There it is. Rome. Different time, different clothes, same posture.
This isn’t cynicism — it’s recognition.
We, the people, love to imagine that we’ve evolved. That our systems, our sophistication, our technology have moved us forward. But have we? Strip away the gold and the marble, and we are often still functioning from the same roots. The same hunger for power. The same imbalance. The same blindness to the living beauty beside and within each of us.

“Mille viae ducunt homines per saecula Romam” — Alain de Lille, Liber Parabolarum
The phrase “All roads lead to Rome” is a proverb that originated from the ancient Roman Empire, reflecting the city’s central importance as a hub of trade, culture, and power.
In a broader sense, it means that there are many different paths or approaches to reach a particular goal or destination. For single mothers in Indonesia, this proverb holds a significant meaning. It represents the understanding that they often face numerous challenges and obstacles in providing for their children and ensuring their well-being. Even when it seems like there are no viable options, single mothers need to be resilient and resourceful, creating new paths to navigate and overcome the difficulties they encounter.
Their children cannot wait for a clear path to access their basic needs, such as food, shelter, and education. It is the responsibility of single mothers to provide these necessities, even if it means forging new paths and finding alternative sources of income. Single mothers cannot rely on their children’s fathers to fulfill their financial ‘obligations’ and give child support, so they must continue to strive for self-sufficiency and sustainability.
I cannot imagine the struggle faced by single mothers without the privileges of higher education, extensive networks, or even personal branding like mine. With a relatively high level of education, the privilege to live in the capital city, and a strong personal brand, I am currently feeling almost desperate in my search for a path to my own version of Rome. I can only imagine the challenges faced by other women who may still be recovering from the abandonment of their former husbands, having been allowed to be only housewives for years and financially dependent on them. My heart goes out to them, and I hope they are always empowered to find their own paths to Rome, their own versions of success.
For me personally, I am still navigating a path that hopefully leads to my version of Rome. I am still somewhat afraid because this time the road is dark and full of obstacles. I am still terrified because I often feel powerless, considering my age and the fact that I have a son who is still fully dependent on me. They say there are many roads to Rome, and I personally believe that. There are many ways to generate income without having to work in an office. However, not everyone can or wants to take those paths.
Some may not be able to see the options in front of them because to them, it’s too dark and eerie, for some others, they would rather close their eyes in fear of the uncertainties. If you currently feel unable to navigate these paths and want to give up, take a break, I feel you. Once you have regained some of your strength, you can continue. If you are currently closing your eyes out of fear, it’s okay to be scared. Give yourself time to muster up the courage and give yourself a chance to see what choices you have.
The important thing is not to give up. Hang in there. If you experience various rejections, it does not mean you have failed. It could be that you are being protected from a much worse condition or being redirected towards a better path to your own version of Rome.
One day, I hope you will look back and see your today as an adventure and valuable experience that you can remember with joy in your hearts. Until then, just hang in there.
I love yous!

Disclaimer: I got a little wild in this article, hide the kids.
History has a tendency to leave out very obvious same-sex relationships. We have all heard of the astute gentleman who lived with his lifelong platonic male friend in a house with one bed. You may not have heard that Hadrian was so head over heels for his lover Antinous that he declared him a god upon Antinous’s death.
I’m sure your partner is kind to you, but have they ever made you a fucking god?
The term homosexuality did not exist in the language of the Romans. So when discussing same-sex relationships in the empire, we have to do so through a lens we may not initially understand. This article will explore how Romans saw sex in general with a few notable examples.
We can only go off historical accounts, artifacts, and writings of the time when discussing civilizations as old as Rome. So while these views might be the majority opinion, there were likely severe deviations in mindset on a one-to-one level.
There was almost certainly an old bitter roman telling younger generations to pull their damn togas up.
We define homosexuality as a relationship between two people of the same gender. Romans defined sex through power and status, which means that as long as you were the dominant party, your reputation was unaffected.
To put it gently, it was admirable to be the sword and pitiful to be the sheath. Didn’t really expect to be conjuring up historical metaphors for anal sex when I woke up today, but here we are.
This could be seen at the highest level of roman society. Nero enjoyed the casual midweek orgy with men and women and did just about everything you can sexually do throughout his life. This includes dressing as an animal and attacking the genitals of tied-up men and women.
The emperor was batshit crazy, but you can’t knock his creativity. He also had sex with his mother. This fun fact isn’t relevant to the article — but I’m telling you anyway.
Nero had a young eunuch boy as his wife named Sporus, who was supposedly the spitting image of his late wife. This speaks to the more common pederasty of the time, but we won’t be getting into that here. I don’t discuss pedophilia before noon, as a rule. This marriage was peculiar but did not hurt the esteem of the emperor; it simply hinted at his mental instability.
It wasn’t until he took the former slave Pythagoras as a husband that everyone started giving a bit of side-eye. This was made worse by the fact that they had sex in front of their wedding guests. This resentment by the onlookers was not because Romans had disdain for same-sex relations. It was because their emperor was the “woman” in the relationship.
This leads me to an important point, Rome was plainly misogynistic. So even though it might seem like Rome was a sexually liberated place for its time, things were far less equal when it came to women. In fact, many considered lesbian relationships an unthinkable transgression.
This did not mean people of the time did not talk about it. A notable myth is that of Iphis, who was a girl raised as a boy. She falls in love with her appointed wife and is turned into a man by Isis. There is also the fictional story of Megilla, who changed her name and wore a wig to marry a Demonassa.
Several people, including Ovid, said women being sexually active exclusively with other women was an exceedingly rare occurrence.
What is more likely is that women were far less open about it than unquestionably powerful men like Nero, Hadrian, and Elagabalus. This is reinforced by the fact that it was seen largely as very socially unacceptable. Sadly, when lesbian relationships were discussed, it was typically with a tone of shame and disapproval.
This might have been due to how Rome perceived women and sex in general. For a woman to sleep with another woman meant that there would be a dominant partner. This was seen as masculine and looked down upon by the people of the time.
Women had an incredibly restrictive life in Rome. This speaks to the intelligence of the many that did manage to rise to power, as it was a very dangerous path to walk for those not born a man. I’ll cover that more when I get into Agrippina the younger, who was a fascinating figure and Nero’s mother.
Y’know, the one he slept with.
We can draw a lot of parallels from Rome, though their society was quite a bit different than it appears on the surface. It should also be said that several of the sexual liberties given to people were reserved for the higher parts of society, with lower social classes being allowed much less personal freedom.
Stay tuned for a more in-depth look at Elagabalus, who is a fascinating character and one of the first transgender people recorded in history.
I’ll drink less coffee next time.
Thanks,
Jack

I always wanted to go visit Rome and Tuscany, but for a while viewed them as two separate trips. But then I thought to myself, why not combine them? I had only seven days to spend in Italy, so it was a challenge.
Would the memories from traveling to Rome overshadow Tuscany? Would I be able to manage logistics and stay within my budget?
Looking back, I think it was a great idea. And now, in the winter of 2023, if someone had asked me what impressed me the most, I would say:
in Rome — Colosseum and in Tuscany — Pitigliano.
Rome Colosseum
I went inside, closed my eyes, and imagined what it was like to live in Rome 2000 years ago when on average 80000 people were watching fights lasting days at the time. Brutal fights, where gladiators were fighting with each other and with wild animals. Where spectators were deciding who lived and who died in the arena below.
The spectators in the Colosseum had separate seats with men being separated from women.
Romans did not have any problems with killing each other just for fun and regularly attending brothels…

When in Rome, See This Treasure:
Saint Cecilia in Trastevere: Patron Saint of Singers, Composers, and Musicians
A quiet Trastevere via opens to a large landscaped courtyard, which fronts this Basilica that was built over the home where Cecilia lived and died.
The courtyard is a lovely neighborhood playground — where you’re bound to see mammas circling strollers around the central Roman urn and nuns chatting away after mass.
In third century Rome, Cecilia was known as the girl who heard angelic harmonies — she could play any instrument or sing any song. She secretly swore to be a chaste Christian, but went through with a marriage her parents arranged anyway. On the wedding night, she broke the news to her husband Valerian, telling him the only way he could touch her was to become a Christian, so he ran off to get baptized. When he returned, he found their bridal chamber transformed — full of flowers and Cecilia wearing a crown of lilies and roses. This miracle swept Valerian into the faith. He made it his mission to help the poor and bury Christian martyrs, and was beheaded for his belief.
Then Cecilia was tortured for her faith, forced into a tub of boiling water in her own bathtub. She sang all…

I want to talk about a recent trend in mobile gaming. It’s the trend of desktop/console games getting re-imagined and made into mobile games. We’ve had all sorts; from League of Legends Wild Rift, to Call of Duty Mobile and even Nintendo getting in on the action with Mario Kart.
These games are not typically straight remasters. They are often altered versions of the original experience.
This means I have been left disappointed on several occasions as I download a game from a beloved franchise expecting the same high quality experience I’m used to on console. Only to get something very different.
Typically I have found it goes one of 2 ways with these console/desktop titles reappearing on mobile:
This is a game I loved as a child and when I realised it had got a mobile re-release I tentatively downloaded it expecting another second rate experience. O boy was I wrong, it’s brilliant!
Rome Total War is a strategy game with 2 types of game play:
So it’s not the simplest game out there. There is a lot of depth and freedom in what you can do in both the campaigns and the battles themselves. Given this, it may seem remarkable that this translates so well to mobile.
Google maps is a fantastic product, and one of the reasons for this is that it’s intuitive to use both on your phone and desktop. It is so easy to explore the world with Google Maps. Whether pinching or scrolling to zoom, clicking or tapping, there is no friction to navigation. Neither mobile nor desktop feel like imitators of the other.
Whether intentional or not, Total War has achieved the same thing with its map navigation. Creating what feels like a completely seamless experience on mobile when navigating the map, even when compared to the old desktop experience. This is hugely important as a large part of this game is about navigating 2D or 3D environments in order to make strategic decisions. It sounds so simple but getting this navigation right, to me is the cornerstone of what makes Rome such a good port.
Alongside the map navigation exploring the UI and interacting with map elements is also incredibly frictionless. With certain button sizes scaled up and freedom in how you scale the HUD I never once felt limited using a touch screen over a mouse and keyboard.
Now this is going to sound overly simplified but here it is. Rome Total War on mobile is such a great game because it is exactly the same as Rome Total War on desktop, and that was a great game.
As far as I can tell nothing is missing from the mobile version versus the desktop game. This means the same incredibly deep campaign experience is available in your pocket.
With too many mobile ports you see simplification or compromises made on the original experience. Which as mentioned before can leave you feeling unsatisfied. Rome Total War does not compromise and that is great.
The best part of Rome Total War is the campaigns. When I played Total War as a child I would play for hours on end, working my way through campaigns one turn at a time. Now if I have hours to play games typically I won’t be on my phone.
However I feel like this port has got me playing just as much as I did as a child, but in a very different way.
You see because the campaigns are turn based this means they are filled with natural pauses. Each turn still takes me 5–10 minutes but this time the game lives in my pocket. Meaning Rome Total War through this brilliant port has shifted from an experience I would settle into on a Sunday afternoon to something I can pick up here and there throughout the week.
So basically I loved Rome Total War as a kid, and now I’ve fallen in love with it again.
The controls are so intuitive you would have thought the game was made for touch screens and the experience is not comprised at all when compared to the desktop version. On top of that the game being on my phone allows for a new style of play. Giving me little bursts of nostalgia throughout my week.
Overall I think Rome Total War is great example of how you can re-release old titles on mobile and breathe new life into them.

In the 2000 years since Roman Emperor Septimius Severus’s reign, many don’t seem to know he was an African man with brown skin. And when I say brown skin, I don’t mean he was a little tan. According to a family portrait painted during his lifetime, Emperor Severus’s skin was an even richer shade of brown:
We’ll talk about why this matters in a moment. But first, please also take a look at Daniel Voshart’s photoreal portrait of all the Roman emperors in which Emperor Severus is featured on the third row in the third image from the left here:
voshart.medium.com
Kinda brown, huh?
The full richness of Severus’s melanin is not prominent in the light colored marble statue of him which was found in Egypt and created somewhere between 193–200 A.D. Held at The British Museum, the statue does depict Severus’s hair and beard as being quite curly. Several coins bearing his image also feature him with curly hair.

I feel like I should be documenting this somewhere. Partially because it feels too good to be true, and the other part, well — believes that everyone should know what everlasting happiness is. Even if it’s just for a moment.
I just moved to a new City. And it’s a godsend. The people here look like me. They speak both my native languages, and they welcome me with their culture. Their hugs. The microcosms in their face, they express gratitude for our shared experience.
The food enriches my being in a way I have not felt in some time. Not all of it tastes like home, but that’s what makes it so familiar. Deeply nourishing to the Ori.
And then.. there’s him. I met an artist. Full of love, of life. Of pain. And also, of beauty. Everything he’s been through shows nowhere on his being. His hands are soft, like a pianist. His callouses showcase strength, fight, only present because life unfortunately placed them there. But he still smiles. He still laughs. And enjoys the little things that life has to offer him.
He’s passionate. As both a lover and a being. He’s armorous. Unshielded for selected few. Olodumare blessed me with an opportunity to see him bare. And his soul — it lights me entirely. His rage and anger, they’re subtle and fleeting. His eyes, a golden honey. His lips, kisses wet enough to quench a thirst I never knew was lingering.
I believe that God gave me the strength and carried me through, just to bring me right here. To know a warmth so pure, so true. And know how to cherish it when it arrived at my doorstep.
And I swear on everything that I know, I would go through it all over again just to meet him once more — in this moment. Right here. Right now.
I’ve always wanted to go to Rome. Since I was a child. Little did I know that the city would offer more than pasta and parmigiano. It would be the thing that brought colors of me back to the canvas. And ultimately, a subconscious iridescence back to life.

Feature by Katie McKnoulty
Now one of Europe’s up-and-coming voices in food, Saghar works with leading editorial and commercial clients; runs cooking workshops across Italy; and has previously contributed to Italy’s national newspaper, Corriere della Sera. Her debut cookbook, Pomegranates & Artichokes, aims to show our innate similarities as humans by tracking recipes on her journey from Iran to Italy. We couldn’t wait to discover Saghar’s Travel Playbook of recommendations to experience when in Rome.
When I was born, we were not only in full Islamic regime, but we were in the middle of a war with Iraq which went from ’80 to ’88. It was very traumatic because I was literally born under bombs. My earliest memories are of the sirens that went off in Tehran that announced the bombings, and we used to put big chunks of tape on the windows so that if they broke, they wouldn’t break into our homes. We would go away for short periods of time when the bombings were very intense, to other cities. I remember very well that they had bombed maybe a few blocks away from our house, and I remember that the curtain of my room had been ripped apart by glass.
From a very early age, the first thing we learned is that your life at home is a very different life from your life outdoors. So indoors, everything is normal — you have parties, your family comes, you put on music. And then we would go to school, and we would have to wear the veil and everything. And your parents would tell you, ‘You shouldn’t say to anyone that we were dancing at home yesterday’ or ‘You should never, ever say that daddy had a drink, because all of that is illegal, OK?’. You don’t know who to trust, and then eventually you learn that almost all of the kids going to your school are living in a similar situation.
At the university where I studied art and architecture in Tehran, we had a very rigid education about composition and light. I struggled a lot in university in Iran to understand things and find my own visual language. Art especially wasn’t my thing, but my mathematical brain understood composition very well. Then, in Rome, I studied graphic design and design general. And eventually, I moved towards photography and food because I became really passionate about it.
I didn’t know anything about Rome. I chose Rome mainly because it was the Italian capital and in my silly, 20-year-old head, the capital is the place to go. This is what I thought. But when I arrived here, despite the difficulties that it has, I really fell in love with it. For those of us coming from countries like Iran, as students, the experience of arriving in Italy is very, very different from that sort of Under the Tuscan Sun experience. We live in a different dimension: when we arrive here, our goal is survival and we don’t have any funds or anything. And we still need to find a job, and we need to do all of these things in Italian. I went through hell because I was really scared of not being able to make it and having to go back to Iran. Even to this day, whenever I go somewhere and I come back here, I’m happy to come back to Rome. It grabs you and never lets go of you.
Rome is a ridiculously beautiful city. I think that’s very important to me. There are certain aesthetic things — like the trees, Roman pines that are like umbrellas, against the backdrop of the ochre and orange buildings. And the blue sky of Rome is something special. It struck me very, very hard in the beginning. And it still does. And then of course it’s historical; it’s charming; it’s got all of those classic grand things that are very beautiful. They give me joy, as frivolous as it may sound.
I live somewhere between the Colosseum and a neighborhood called Esquilino. And over the years it was not known as a very nice place, but now it’s becoming very nice and lovely — I think there’s been a bit of gentrification. It has a very, very long street called Via Merulana that leads to the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore; one of Rome’s biggest treasures. They have extraordinary medieval mosaics there — absolutely stunning. I love that church a lot. And then, in terms of museums, Palazzo Massimo and Palazzo Altemps are some of the most beautiful things that you can see — not just in Rome, but in Italy, possibly in the world. Often my suggestion to people who can’t get Vatican tickets or who don’t want to queue for three-and-a-half hours under the burning sun, is to get a combo ticket. It lasts for two days and you can see all of them, including the Vatican. It’s mind-blowing, absolutely mind-blowing.
In the side streets of the Via Merulana, there are a couple of nice places. One of them is a new bakery — Forno Conti. They have bread of course, but also croissants and cakes, and it’s become very popular. There’s a little community around it. It’s very different from the classic Roman bakery. Then there’s a little wine bar that’s quite famous now in Trastevere called Enoteca l’Antidoto, and they have very nice natural wines and littles dishes. There’s another trattoria called Trattoria Pennestri. The food is Roman but with an elegant little twist. You need to book but it’s not impossible to get in.
I do a lot of shopping at Esquilino Market. To be honest, the quality of fruit and veg is not always, like, a farmers market, but it’s possibly the most multicultural market in Rome. And you can find a lot of ingredients that you can’t find anywhere else. The African community shops there; the Chinese community shops there; the Bangladeshi and Indian community shops there. So it’s very interesting.
After university I discovered food blogs. Some of them were people who were very much like me — they had a background in the arts and now they were working with food. Some of them were doing astonishing photography, and that was the moment that it clicked. And I thought, ‘I can do this’ — not so much because I knew how to do photography, because I didn’t, but because I knew composition and I knew light. So I started practicing. It took me some time but it was also very nice, because for the first time I had found my visual language — the thing that I had struggled so much to find. It was very liberating.
The more I worked with food, the more I was intrigued with its cultural and political aspects and what it represents. So I started blogging about it and writing about it. And this is how I came to write my first cookbook, Pomegranates & Artichokes, which is exactly about those things. It’s also autobiographical, and this is what I do: I love to look at cultures, habits and situations through the lens of food, literally and figuratively.
Pomegranates & Artichokes is a cookbook that starts in Iran; then it travels west, crossing the Mediterranean and the Middle East through Turkey, Greece, Lebanon and Syria, all of those countries. And it arrives in Italy as if you were taking a flight — it literally does this journey. I love watching the map thing on the airplane and this is exactly that. I got this idea because this is a book that is born out of my experience of living as an Iranian, but mostly as an immigrant, here in Italy, in the West. This whole book is about how a lot of the flavors, ingredients and cooking methods are super similar. We’re not even that far, geographically speaking. Basically, you cross Greece and Turkey, and you’re in Iran — so how is it that people from my side of the world are treated so differently where our food is so similar? So this book is a testimony to those similarities.
It started because of the protests of the death of Mahsa Amini, who was murdered because she was showing a few strands of hair. So it is about compulsory hijab, and yet it is not just about compulsory hijab. There are many rights that women in Iran don’t have: the testimony of a woman in court is worth half of a man’s; women can work but if your husband says you cannot work then you cannot work; you can’t have rights to the custody of your child if you get divorced; and you can’t ask for a divorce — the right to divorce lies with the husband. What’s happening to the women in Iran concerns us all. And the fight against the Iranian regime is the fight to be on the right side of history.
Always window. I like to have space to lean out and look out of the window. But it’s mostly the leaning thing.
‘Via da Roma’ by Luca Barbarossa, from the album Roma è de tutti. The name says it all. It’s very nice.
Contradictory.
There are a lot of beautiful things and lots of ugly things. Like all big cities.

After a long silence (because reasons), I return to Medium (as intended a while ago!) I actually have several unfinished stories, some that are in old school notebooks and others just existing as a draft in title. So content is in abundance and hopefully I’ll be able to share more and more consistently in the coming weeks. I even acquired a tablet, with one of the main motives being more writing. In fact, my return article is related: I’ll write about a game I’ve been playing on the tablet. So without further ado, let’s talk Grow Empire: Rome!
As an avid Starcraft UMS and Warcraft 3 custom map player, I’m always on the lookout for tower defense maps on mobile. My recent search brought me to Grow Empire Rome. The name was familiar, but I hadn’t give it much thought at first. The reason it was familiar was because of a game I played on my phone before: Grow Castle and I would indeed notice the gameplay parallels quite soon into the game. They aren’t developed by same people from what it seems and indeed there seems to be a major difference between the games. Okay, enough with the fluff and meta, let me talk about the game!
Grow Empire Rome, GER from now on, is a defense game, rather than a traditional TD. As you might imagine, it has a Roman Empire setting. You have a base where barbarians attack, wave by wave, each wave triggered by you. So you don’t start a game and play 10 waves. You play one wave and it’s over. You can start the next one if you like. On top of that, there is an empire map and you can launch invasions on enemy colonies to acquire them, which sort of reverses the roles. Each acquired colony then has 3 waves of rebels you can fight whenever you wish. I haven’t bested the 3rd level yet, but I’m guessing that’s it.
You gain gold from kills in each wave (meaning you get some even if you fail the defense) plus some amount from your colonies. This amount can be increased by upgrading the colonies by investing in some gold. You even generate some of this gold when you are not playing. You will also get the option to watch an ad to get some gold now and then. Gold is used for upgrading your walls, archers, towers and units. The upgrades will occasionally have visual affects too. Units will look better every 4 upgrades and your flimsy fences will turn into actual walls with archers and towers in time.
The other currency, crystals, is acquired after every 10 levels or so, plus by defeating the rebellions in colonies. Crystals are used to buy and upgrade heroes, a type of unit that brings a passive bonus to your army as well as fighting actively on the front line. You also use crystals to upgrade your bank, which in turn improves your gold gain from colonies when you aren’t playing the game. You can also buy card packs with crystals. These you can use when invading colonies to provide you bonuses. Finally, you can buy mercenaries, which are extra troops you can use in invasions. As you might imagine, you can buy crystals and farming them takes some time (but not too terrible to unlock the most expensive hero to be honest.)
Finally, you gain experience from battles. This is earned by the General, which is basically you. You can level up and distribute skill points to unlock passive and active skills. I’m not sure if there are ceilings for these bonuses. I believe the cost to increase a skill also increases in time. I have leveled one to 20 and so far haven’t seen it though.
Each wave is basically a bunch of enemies rushing at your walls, fighting any troops they may encounter on the way. Your archers and towers will attack any enemies in their range but your main fighting force will be the reinforcements you summon. There are several unit types that will attack you and you will use to defend, sort of in a Rock Paper Scissors setup.
Speaking of unit types, there are 4+1+1 in total. 4 are the core units that you can use anywhere: Infantry, anti-cavalry infantry, ranged and cavalry. Then there is the siege unit, which is a battering ram that resembles Age of Empires variants. This is only used by the sieging party, not the defenders. Finally there is the elephant. From what I see this is only for the computer. Oh, and the heroes I mentioned above. I only saw them for our side and I imagine computer do not have them.
Normal waves will only spawn two types of units, one group after the other e.g one ranged, then one infantry, then another ranged… until the whole wave is cleared. You will have two charges of reinforcements at the start and you can use any of the 4 types, you don’t need to choose a layout. This will come handy in every 10 levels where there will be bigger groups of enemies in sort of mini waves, and their unit types will also change within a single wave. Every 30 levels you will face elephants that are loaded with hp and offensive power. Luckily, you aren’t limited to the two types of units at the start: As soon as you summon a unit, the bar will start filling and you’ll be able to summon more during the fight.
In addition to summoning troops, you have a few active powers you can use. These are your defenses (catapult and towers) and your general powers (e.g. raining arrows on enemies.) Some are skill shots (like the catapult) and others just work (like the general power that gives a damage boost.) You can also choose the ammunition type of your towers to be more effective versus troops or siege units.
The second part of the game is the colony map where you invade colonies, upgrade them and defend them against rebels. There are several colonies with increasing defense strengths, indicated by numbers on them. You can have 3 legions in each attack, which have 6 unit slots each. My legion consists of 4 main units, my hero and the siege unit. I believe the rest is to add mercenaries and maybe probably other heroes as well. Not much to do here as you don’t summon extra units and have no towers. You just use your general powers. The enemy has some troops at the start and gets reinforcements, so usually you’ll use them on cooldown to win as soon as possible. Once you take over, you can upgrade them a few times to increase the income, then fight the rebel waves whenever you want. This is basically a reverse invasion: the strength of base depends on the colony and the whole army attacks altogether.
The game shop is pretty simple. You can buy crystals, which you can use to buy commanders and card packs. If you just want to unlock the heroes, the crystal package around 20€ is enough (Germany IOS store) and a more pragmatic approach might be to buy less crystals and only get the Roman Commander (the most expensive one,) or maybe buy the same amount of crystals and just use the surplus to upgrade him a bunch. For the record, you don’t need this hero. The one you get through the campaign is pretty good and has a gold bonus that should be useful for a new account.
In the end, it’s nice that the game does not force you buy anything. But then again, I usually buy something from free games if I spent some time on it… but I really didn’t feel like buying anything.
All in all, I did sink some hours into the game in the last days. But it was also because I was sick and resting at home. I feel like I’ll depart ways as I don’t think there is more to see in this game. It doesn’t feel challenging, there isn’t much to see other than a couple soldier models and the grind is way too steep.
That said, if you are looking for something to play on the train or you know, the sacred part of the house, feel free to take a look. I did enjoy majority of the time I sank.
Before I end the article, there is another topic I want to talk about.
Now, checking the downloads and review counts, I notice that GER is way bigger than Grow Castle but since I played Grow Castle first, I want to compare them a bit.
The major difference is that GrowCastle uses the auto fight mechanic. You get some of it via playing and you can purchase it if you want: Basically the game will launch waves on its own and will use skills on cooldown. Sounds weird, but it actually works because in the end, the game is super repetitive and you basically play because of three reasons: Leaderboards, to unlock everything to see how they work (that’s me) and either lack of or surplus of will power to unlock everything and max them out. For the second, you only need a certain amount of grind and you want to be done with them. The other two makes you grind A LOT. So you want the result but without the effort… because the effort is really just starting waves after a while, then upgrading something every 5–10 waves or so. It’s not skill, it’s monkey work (no offense to tablet using chimps.)
I really, really expected this to appear in GER because the core loops of the two games are literally the same. But it didn’t appear and honestly, I’m a bit disappointed. I would love to see the final forms of the soldiers but I don’t know if I want to endure through the grind.
Despite GER being the bigger title, I think Grow Castle was more interesting in terms of content. There are many heroes and tower types to choose from and you can actually have builds in that game. Unfortunately, it looked to me like in GER you can just upgrade the main soldiers (which are out of the Rock Paper Scissors — they have no advantages or disadvantages) and summon them and only them and succeed. The comments I’ve read online also indicate that way.
So if you liked GER, I would strongly recommend to check out Grow Castle too. In fact, I would recommend it over GER, unless you are here for the theme.

We sat on the edge of high seats, resting elbows and ales on a wine barrel that had been fashioned into a table. Pigeons cooed on the cobblestones around our feet, foraging for crumbs and shards of cracker crisp crust that rained to the ground as we bit into our sandwiches. I had to hunch over parted legs to keep from covering myself in falling arugula and dripping olive oil as I ate. Mike leaned similarly across from me, his sandwich partially exposed but still neatly cradled in its parchment wrapping, a wad of napkins clutched in his right hand to wipe the corners of his mouth as he sipped and chewed. Over his shoulder I watched my romanticized vision of Rome play like a scrolling vignette, fairytale pictures unfurling from the pages of a luxury travel magazine.
Families and tourists wandered the narrow side street like a driven flock, progressing from the Tiber River on to the Spanish Steps awaiting them at the end of the cobblestone shoot. Heads swiveled and eyes swept in every direction, not a single explorer mindful of the path directly in front of them. Each was lost in their own sense of wonder. I followed the gaze of a little girl in a flowery yellow sundress. She wore a pink hoodie to keep her warm against the early spring breeze and her mother tugged her along by the hand. As she traipsed her attention remained fixed on a large three dimensional cone jutting out above the door of an artisan gelato shop. A huge scoop of pistachio gelato perched so perfectly on the plastic waffle that I imagined it dripping onto her outstretched tongue as she passed underneath.
A young bride-to-be led a parade of attendants from a corner flower stall. They wound their way around and through the creeping throng of tourists. Each had their hands full with a flat of matching centerpiece arrangements. Porcelain white lilies with long slender stalks of green, perfectly positioned and pinned, peaking out of vases the way only an artist could do. The florist, minding brilliant pops of crimson, fuchsia and marigold under a vast white umbrella, beamed with a contented smile as she watched her artistry depart. She was roused from her prideful stare by a lovestruck gentleman wishing to purchase a bouquet. I adored this about Rome, the prevalence of corner flower stalls. These oases struck wild contradiction to the bustling chaos; a fragrant reminder to temper progress with love and frivolity.
Rome was all this way. Everyday life coexisting effortlessly with the fray of visitors. Housewives with canvas bags of fruit and loaves of bread. Delivery drivers beeping and weaving their scooters through seas of pedestrian traffic, indifferent to potential catastrophe. Shopkeepers wandered out of their stores to chat and smoke cigarettes with their neighbors. Fashionable couples walked dogs and tenants added to growing piles of refuse spilling out of already overfilled dumpsters. The sounds of suitcases rolling and clacking over ancient pavers mixing with the patter of peddlers. It was a symphony. I was in love with Rome’s nuanced perfection. But no moment brought me more joy than this — our simple picnic perched outside of IL Salumaio, immersed in it all.
I’d wanted one experience in Rome: an authentic Italian sandwich made with hand shaved artisan charcuterie, layered on rustic bread with fresh cheeses and fragrant oil. I craved the experience I’d witnessed TV chefs and travel vloggers drool over time and time again. I wanted to have my own moment. A first satisfying bite that would send my eyes rolling back in my head with gastronomic euphoria. Mike was eager for pizza but Rome to me had to be this consummate sandwich picked up at an authentic corner shop. It had to be a genuine place, a place locals might go themselves for lunch. I wanted the staff to be a little indignant at our brass to invade their native sanctuary with our travel maps and attempts at broken Italian. I’d been swooning over the fruition of this sandwich months before my first airport margarita.
And I was nervous. I did not want to waste my opportunity on an imitation or weak trattoria contender. How were we to choose? I’d researched so many possibilities that I was dizzy with worry. What if we got it wrong and my vision of Rome shattered, leaving me with rancid memories of crowded lineups and the unending wail of emergency vehicle sirens? The stakes were high. This was our last day in Rome, we’d almost used up our half dozen dining opportunities in the city before departing for Sorrento. Until the hunger rumbling in my belly grew louder than the nagging for success I was dangerously close to overthinking the whole thing and missing out on my quintessential sandwich experience entirely.
We were on route to the Spanish Steps, having spent the early part of the day touring the Vatican Museum. It was well past midday and I was growing cranky, I fully admit it. My morning cornetto and cappuccino wore off somewhere between the Sistine Chapel and St. Angelo Bridge and hunger was gaining control of my good mood and cheerful disposition. Mike and I have been married long enough to recognize when we’ve met the point of perturbation that requires one of us to maturely recognize the importance of food. He reeled me in, “let’s eat.” and I was fully on board. I no longer cared as much about the authenticity of the trattoria we would find, as I did the necessity to get the thing done and put some food in my belly.
Hunger is under-appreciated by the traveler. We tend so easily to keep full, to graze endlessly and maintain a constantly satiated state. Trying bits of this and that and endeavoring to consume memories with the same fervor we use to fill camera phones. Not often do we allow our bellies to rumble and tell us we’re low on fuel. But hunger, the small h kind with light pangs and hankerings, the kind that clouds your good humor and makes you snap with insincerity can be a good thing. That kind of hunger spurs creativity and shuts up the food critic who, back home, keeps grape jelly away from corn chips. It makes us fall for gas station hotdogs and lures us to try regional oddities, offal stew and platters of whole sardines grilled with lemon and paprika. Hunger can be a blessing to a food experience traveler. Sometimes it’s the only thing that gets us out of our own head and opens us up to chance encounters. Hunger, on this day, in its wisdom, turned us left and forced us across the threshold of the first shop we could locate with meats and cheeses hanging in the window.
Inside Il Salumaio the wall displayed a dozen menu offerings, a curated list of combinations customers could order with ease. No sandwich had more than five or six quality components, and every ingredient in its own right sounded downright delicious. Glass cases were filled with cured meats and ripe cheeses. Prosciuttos and aging coppas hung overhead. The smell of fresh bread wafted from behind saloon doors and the resulting large flat sheets of rustic loaves were piled on the counter waiting to be portioned and sliced open. Bowls of sun ripened pomodoro and fresh mozzarella di bufala, marinated artichokes and basil crowded one end of the display case. Bottles of olive oil, truffle oils and an array of balsamics lined a shelf behind the counter. The hinges of my jaw twinged and tingled. I wanted so badly to touch and smell everything, I wanted to devour a chisel of gritty parmesan and secure a handful of olives to stuff in my pocket for later.
I halted my rumbling instead with an offering of whisper thin pistachio studded mortadella piled with wedges of Grana Padano, honey infused truffle oil and a large handful of arugula. Mike opted for the Italiano, a simple combination of prosciutto crudo, mozzarella di bufalo, tomato and basil. And there we sat, out there in the street with the pigeons, taking it all in. Swapping our choices halfway through as we often do. Enjoying the simplest of meals curated by chance and living fully in the moment that will forever encapsulate the memory of Rome for me. That sandwich made it all real. It fixed the impression of Rome to my spirit for eternity and I’ll be forever grateful to hunger and serendipity for this moment.
Back home from time to time, I make large flattish loaves of ciabatta and pile them with the best Italian cured meats I can acquire. It costs a fortune compared to the few euros a hand held lunch with pigeons cost us in Rome but with the best company and a lovely smattering of quality olive oil I can almost smell the orange trees and the Tiber River. I add wedges of parm and ripe tomato, handfuls of arugula and metered doses of the truffle oil we brought home in our suitcase cocooned inside a clean pair of socks. We sit in near silence together, quietly reliving memories. I think of cobblestones and a little girl in a yellow flowered sundress. I crave gelato and run my mind over the smoothly worn treads of the Spanish Steps. Mike tosses coins into Trevi fountain and we circle the trek around the Coliseum. We partake in an evening passeggiata and visit the Pantheon at dusk, but I always come back to that moment on Via Della Croce when my eyes rolled back in my head, fully involved in that first magical bite of Italy.
This is the joy of traveling for me. Losing myself in unplanned encounters, tying my memories to meals I attempt to recreate at home. I owe so much of my joy to moments of hunger and its gentle reminder that letting go is part of the experience. A part that very often leads to the greatest discoveries and experiencing the true authenticity of a place. A reminder that the pleasure of something as mundane as a sandwich should never be overlooked. The whole of a culture could be hiding in just one bite.

Me, Chelsey, and Jahan — a proper girl group — hopped off the plane at Fiumicino. This was my first trip to a non English speaking country. I was a struggling actress, fretting over if my hair was too blonde and how I was coming across on camera. Meanwhile, in the background, something exciting was happening. It just didn’t know it yet.
We took a cab into the city (90 euros — which means we got majorly ripped off. This often happens to Americans. Offer 60 Euros and no more!) and arrived at a breathtaking piazza in Trastevere.
There were kids throwing glow circles into the air, there was live music, and hundreds of Romans and tourists alike were dining on the patios of the surrounding restaurants. The piazza was complete with a fountain and an ancient church— the pious statues looking down on the raucous social center with irony. We later found out it was the oldest church in Rome. This would be our home.
Our building in the piazza had a large front window where I’d often sit and stare down in the evening. I was very far from Ohio!

Earlier in 2023, I thought of fulfilling my wanderlust and taking off on a solo trip in Europe — something my younger self wouldn’t have even dreamed of.
In my attempt to live in the present (coupled with my habit of tardily posting photos), I felt it was important to journal my experiences to capture my raw thoughts and feelings while I travel.
I’m glad I wrote them as it took me months to finally get around to sharing my travel stories, but here we go.
1/X: Barcelona, Spain || June 2023
Rome, Italy || July 2023
The day this photo was taken was the day I just did more sight-seeing: revisiting the Trevi Fountain, exploring the Spanish Steps and going around Piazza di Spagna, and marveling at the Pantheon.
I was grateful I didn’t have to take a long time in these places because the reality was that I was feeling anxious, looking for a repair shop that could service an American model of my luggage just a day before I depart for Firenze.
I knew and I’ve been warned it was not the wisest idea to travel by myself to my hand-picked destinations with a big luggage in tow. I still did it anyway, thinking I could somehow have a semblance of home and comfort packed in a suitcase.
That time, I was only a week away from home, but boy, did I feel the most alone.
Traveling is definitely fun, but what we don’t see in photos is how it could invoke some feelings of anxiety too.
I eventually found myself capping the night at Trastevere.
I’m glad I made it well that day. As usual, thanks to the people providing care and support in person and virtually, and for that night, for that rich plate of truffle pasta and a glass of wine to comfort me.
I leave Roma today to transfer to Firenze.
This city captivated me — maybe made me fall in love — during last year’s visit with my family; it’s one of the main reasons why I wanted to return to Italy.
But today I recognize how life continues to surprise us —
like that time I walked through the ruins of the Colosseo and be reminded that I used to wonder about it when I was a child but never deeply dreamed of it because I thought it was impossible to see,
but also I have those times when I’ve been working towards a dream, a desire, and then realizing it may not necessarily be what I want or need.
So here’s a little (self-)reminder: I hope that when things aren’t going how you think they’re supposed to be, open up yourself to the opportunity, and trust that life will continue to surprise you.

Dear friend,
I’m holding a glass of Aperol spritz, and this is the view in front of me. It’s a hot April afternoon in Rome, about 25 degrees. I’m wearing my black dress, feeling the Roman elegance. A slight breeze touches my face.
On the way here, we climbed a hill. There were many people around in their stylish outfits-tourists and Italians. We ascended numerous stairs that seemed to stretch up to the sky. The stairs were made of stone and they were old, like everything in Rome.
After climbing so many stairs, we entered a garden filled with tall trees. There were no tourists here, only Romans. I guess this is one of Rome’s hidden treasures. I only hear Italian being spoken, no other languages.
It’s hot, and the sun is shining directly on my face. I take a sip of my Aperol spritz and feel better. It has ice in it. I take a piece of ice into my mouth and let it cool me down.
The view is spectacular. It takes my breath away. There are so many beautiful buildings in front of me. It feels like sitting in a park with a large balcony in the middle of Rome, admiring the city. Rome knows how to melt your heart; you just have to let it. It is so beautiful, maybe the most beautiful city in the world, at least for me up to now.
There is a big church on my left and a few more on the horizon. Far away, you can see trees blending into the cityscape. The street below curves to the right, with many cars passing by. I take out my sketchbook and start to draw.
Valentine is sitting next to me. I love him a lot, and I’m happy we’re here together. Now he is talking to me about his girlfriend. I like that we’re so open with each other.
Too bad, I finished my drink. The sun is shining intensely, and there are two boys next to us. One of them is shirtless. He reminds me of a character from “Call Me by Your Name.” He looks very young and has a beautiful body like the sculptures in Rome. They’re smoking weed; I can smell it from here.
People around me are speaking Italian. I don’t understand it, but I like it. I think if I were Roman, I would come to this place a lot. And if you were visiting me, I would bring you here.
I know you would like to write your diary here or read your book, maybe Fernando Pessoa’s poems. This place feels like a little escape from the chaos of the city, a spot to sit, relax, and savor Rome.
The place is called Villa Aldobrandini, with the stairs located on Via Mazzarino. I really think you should visit this park. I painted the view for you to find it easily. There is a part of me there, you should visit that place.
Love,
Me

I found this today:
# hosts# Generate standard hosts tables.# Newnet doesn’t really use it, it’s just for easy reference.# Neither does oldnet now, since it’s doing DNS right.#
It lives on line 327 of a Makefile used to build and distribute various configurations around our infrastructure. And it’s old. “How old”, you might ask?
Those lines have been in that file for 19 years. I know that, because I have primary historical evidence, as they say in archaeology.
When I asked about this “oldnet” thing, my boss told me to look up a document, Tenwen: The Re-engineering Of A Computing Environment. It’s a peer reviewed paper from LISA’94 that chronicles the creation of the fabric underlying the network that I administer today.
In the paper, under Fixed Name Service (September 1992):
Once name service was working, we modified the Newnet hosts to do hostname lookups correctly.
This fixed the naming problems for Newnet, but Oldnet was still broken. While we wanted to limit the amount of work we put into Oldnet, we also felt that having name service working correctly could only make it easier to administrate Newnet. We therefore modified Oldnet to use the nameserver on Newnet, and quit using host files on Oldnet as well.
So, those lines date to September, 1992. I was 13 years old.
One time, a couple of weeks after I started working here, one of the other admins asked me what I thought of all of it. The infrastructure, the network, and so on. It took a couple of seconds for me to put my thoughts together, and I said, “Have you ever been to Rome?”
He had, so I continued, “This network is Rome”.
He was confused, understandably, so I explained.
Some networks are like Phoenix, AZ. They’re relatively new and shiny. They’re brought up for the purpose they serve, and for the time in which they exist. There’s not a building in Phoenix over 125 years old. It was built according to relatively modern methods, and the streets are largely laid out in a grid, because there wasn’t a whole lot to get in their way. The city was started from essentially a clean slate.
Some networks, particularly in non-technological companies, are much more like Ephesus in Turkey. Ephesus is amazing…it’s kind of like a metropolis the size of Orlando just got up and left. Seriously, I was there, and it was mind-boggling. It’s almost exactly like it was 1500 years ago. There has been no modern development there, so when you walk through it, you’re in the midst of miles of ruins.
Rome, on the other hand, is a different sort of beast. Romulus founded the City of Seven Hills 2,500 years old, if you believe the legends, and it has been occupied for pretty much the entire time since. When you climb out of an underground Metro station full of artifacts excavated while digging the subway tunnels you just left, you may find yourself facing an Roman gladiatorial arena turned into a Catholic church. The modern Rome grew up out of the old, and there’s a continual architectural history of the past 2500 years waiting on you to find it.
It’s the exact same way here on this network. The new Windows desktop infrastructure runs smoothly alongside the host database mentioned in the paper above, written 20 years ago. It relies on the host database, actually. Like Rome’s streets, sewer, viaducts, and aquaducts, these antique systems were vital to the time, and if they aren’t still in use, they paved the way for the modern systems that replaced them.
Being someone who likes archaeology, antiquities, and old libraries and junk stores, working here is a pleasure, because there’s always something new to discover, and like I did today, a rich history behind it.

Everywhere I turned in Rome, there were overwhelmingly inspiring sights, but they were overrun by tourists, myself included. All week, I purposely was getting off the beaten path, scouring the city for places away from the tourist crowds. I find it hard to fully enjoy Rome with the constant crush of tourists everywhere I turn.
This Sunday, however, dawned differently. A strange quiet settled over the city. No honking horns, no chattering crowds, just the gentle gurgling of the Tiber River as I walked along its banks. I’d gotten up much earlier than usual, setting out on a walk from my Vatican City apartment to Trastevere, a charming neighbourhood in Rome.
The river’s curvy ribbon unfolded before me, its surface a polished mirror reflecting the soft glow of the awakening sun. Crossing the Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II, a bridge of pale stone and impressive arches, I paused to admire the view. Soft pastel colours, like scoops of gelato, washed over the city — a sea of terracotta rooftops dotted with church domes. Rome is a scene straight out of a postcard.
I relish the quietness of the city, broken only by the rhythmic pounding of lone runners and the occasional flash of brightly coloured bikes zipping past me. Sticking to the eastern side of the river, I watched the city slowly stir to life.
Reaching Ponte Garibaldi, I took in the panorama again. This vantage point revealed how far I’d wandered, with St. Peter’s Basilica’s dome just a distant peak. In front of me, a tiny emerald oasis emerged from the river — Tiber Island. A bright orange building, like a giant creamsicle, stood at its tip. (This is the hospital, by the way!)
Two bridges connect Tiber Island. Ponte Fabricio, the oldest bridge in Rome, stood strong with its thick stone arches from 62 BC. Beside it, Ponte Cestio is adorned with three graceful arches. Crossing over, I am greeted by the tourist-favourite Trastevere neighbourhood.
Trastevere was just waking up. Street cleaners swept away the remnants of Saturday night’s partying. Trucks rumbled by, collecting overflowing bins. Storefronts remained shuttered, and chairs and tables stacked high are starting to be dismantled setting up for Sunday lunch. It’s a neighbourhood waking and preparing for a new day’s performance.
Wandering through Trastevere’s narrow streets, I admired its unique beauty. Peeling paint, colourful graffiti, overflowing flower boxes, ivy climbing the walls, and laundry strung cheerfully across the balconies — even the “rundown” parts held a charm.
Reaching the tall stone archway, Porta Portese, I entered the famed Sunday flea market. But the peaceful bliss of my morning walk vanished instantly. Chaos engulfed me — shouts, haggling, and mountains of stuff piled everywhere. It was a stark contrast to the serenity I’d enjoyed just hours earlier.
Later that day, nestled in a cozy Trastevere trattoria buzzing with Sunday family lunch, I savoured my delicious cacio e pepe. The quiet morning walk solidified a travel revelation for me: waking up early unlocks a hidden side of the city.
For anyone who truly wants to experience a place, especially one as busy as Rome, consider rising with the sun. Early mornings offer a rare moment of tranquillity, allowing for a deeper connection to a city.
Even if you’re not a morning person, dedicate one day on your trip to this slow travel approach. You might be surprised by the magic you discover in the quietness of the city.

Rome is home to many churches and religious sites. Catholicism has deep-seated roots in the city, which is made even more apparent since the city is home to the pope.
I visited the city last month with some students on my first Spring Break tour. Part of the tour was a three-day stay in Rome. We visited the Vatican and the Colosseum and even took a day trip to visit Pompeii. The city is filled with piazzas and pizzas at every turn. Rome breathes history; if you can get away from the crowds.
This year, Rome was crowded a bit more than usual due to the Jubilee celebration. We often found ourselves working our way through busy crowds of fellow visitors, trying to take a photo at some of the most well-known sites.
Still, we found ourselves able to enjoy the city with its plazas and shops. One thing to remember about Italy is that they are not in a hurry like Americans tend to be. If you sit down at a cafe for lunch, expect to be there for an hour at least. Enjoy your meal, and maybe a nice glass of Italian wine.
If you visit Rome, try to find places that are less well-known to tourists. Yes, we saw the Trevi Fountain, the Colliseum, and the Forum. And while these places are amazing and worth spending time in, there are plenty of places in…

If you had been strolling down Corso Vittorio Emanuele in Rome among the many exclusive shops and charming sidewalk cafes on a sunny Sunday afternoon a few years ago, you might have seen eight well-dressed, middle-aged-to-elderly people slugging, kicking, cursing, and wrestling each other on the sidewalk, as a small crowd looked on.
Utterly unprepared for a street brawl, four American tourists and an Italian family sprang into what can only be called clumsy, slapstick, stop-the-chaos-at-any-cost, WHAT-THE-F*CK?!, schoolyard defense mode.
I know because I was one of them.
Until then, it had been a relaxing Italian vacation with my close friends Jenny and Doug, and my (now ex-)wife. We had traveled to Rome to attend the wedding of some friends and had spent the subsequent couple of weeks touring around Italy together on holiday.
We’d had a wonderful time driving aimlessly around in a toy-size rental car playing archeologists to Italy’s hieroglyphic road signs.
We’d marveled at paintings of naked people and mythological heroes in museums and did all we could to assist the natives in their efforts to vanquish the copious amounts of red wine and pasta the country…

“Take the first steps in faith. You do not have to see the whole staircase.” Martin Luther King Jr.
The Spanish Steps are one of the most recognizable places in the Eternal City. This place became popular long before the advent of mass tourism. At the beginning of the 16th century, the first hotels were built here, and in the 17th century, Spain acquired the Monaldeschi Palace and turned the building into an embassy. From that moment on, the square began to be called Spanish.
The stairs were paid for by a French diplomat, Étienne Gueffier, who thought it would be a great idea to connect The Spanish Square Piazza di Spagna to the French Santissima Trinita dei Monti church as a symbol of unity between Spain and France.
Did you ever count the steps by running up and down the stairs? I counted 270 steps during my round trip from the street level to the top and back — until a local policeman, carabinieri, tried to stop me.
They could not catch up and yelled at me not to run up the stairs. I giggled like a schoolgirl caught running by a principal.
As I ran the stairs, I remembered Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck sitting together on the Spanish Steps in their movie Roman Holiday. Watching Hollywood movies was how I learned European geography as a little girl.

We’ve finally found a grocery store right before closing time. It’s nighttime and the city pulsates nearby, colorful walkways beckoning us to invest more walking time, to explore one more little corner. But it’s crucial to get supplies for an evening snack and therefore a comfortable morning.
Whoa, what’s this?
It seems there’s a one-way flow of traffic through this store. I’ve passed the fruit section but decided I’d better get some more tomatoes after all. My feet are screaming at me to stop walking. As I reverse course for those cherished tomatoes, I face an onslaught of busy Romans going the proper and correct way in the store. I’m odd man out, like a salmon swimming my way upstream in a sea of annoyed Italians who’re peeved I haven’t learned the one-way-traffic etiquette.
What the hell is up with this freakin’ store layout, my brain screams. Why do they have to make it so complicated? Humans can’t be expected to always get what they need in the absolute same order every time!!
My partner Eddie and I make it to the checkout line with our bounty. Success. We’ll be back to the room and crashed out in bed in no time.

You never owned the terra firma of your conquests,Or the seven hills of your Eternal City,
You were but a transient occupying space at a moment in time.
Scorching the earth of those daring to oppose you,Sacking cities, devouring abundance, and smelting gold,
Your patricians choked on the gluttony of your spoils.
Sweating blood from the souls of the indigenous,Condemning slaves to perish in arenas of folly,
You demanded loyalty or slaughter.
Shearing forests to build your ships,Swallowing wilderness with your pastures,
Fallow were your promises of justice, freedom, and security.
Buying mercenaries with your taxes and tarrifs,Burying the poor with your worthless denarii,
Your gods crumbled into a common grave.
Woe to The Empire, Sunk into oblivion by corruption and greed,
Destiny is never kind to the likes of you!

Italy has always been my dream destination as I grew up watching Bollywood movies where many Italian places like the Colosseum, Venice, and the Leaning Tower of Pisa are shown. During my work assignment in Switzerland, I had the incredible opportunity to explore this beautiful country in just three days. Starting from Zurich, my journey took me to Milan, Venice, Pisa, and Rome. Even though my schedule was tight, this trip was unforgettable where I was lucky to see stunning places and have delightful moments.
Let me take you through my whirlwind Italian 3-day trip.

Flo is one of the first to enter the city after Nazis retreat
My mother and Audie Murphy ch. 15
The city of Rome was liberated by Allied troops June 4, 1944. Flo got to Rome the next day, June 5. She told me she was proud to come into the city with General Mark Clark and the U.S. 5th Army. The Third Division had taken big hits in battles at Anzio and on the Italian coast. Rome would be an easy victory, a source of prestige for the leaders and pride for infantrymen recovering from those battles. Later, historians and Allied commanders agreed that Clark’s decision to march into Rome instead of cutting off a large part of the retreating German army was a major blunder, extending the war for maybe another year. In any case, the liberation of Rome was overshadowed by the D-Day landings on the beaches of Normandy in northern France on June 6.
Flo kept detailed notes in a tiny pocket-sized diary. This was the first entry.
Monday June 5, 1944
Came into Rome in amphib Jeep with Frank Gates.
They were traveling from the camp at Pozzuoli, a seaside town on the Gulf of Naples where they’d been bivouacked with the Third Division. At first I imagined that they drove the 138 miles on the bombed out rutted roads. But these amphibious jeeps were faster in the water than on land, so now I’m thinking they traveled on the water. Amphib jeeps were used by the Third Division because they were training for an amphibious landing in France that would take place in August.
Flo didn’t make note of who was with her and Frank Gates, but I’m imagining all four of the American Red Cross women in her group went to Rome together. Gates was able to secure a promise from a rich anti-Nazi Roman to allow the ARC clubmobilers to stay in his fancy villa. The four women moved in soon after. The man did much to make them comfortable.
I wasn’t able to find information about Frank Gates but I believe he was Flo’s boss, the Red Cross director on the Italian front whose job was to establish ARC canteens and clubs near the front lines of fighting. He would be driving around Rome to look for suitable buildings in which to house the clubs.
Unlike Naples, which had been bombed for years, Rome had been spared from widespread destruction by the Nazis in part due to its declaration as an “open city” by the Italian government and the efforts of the Vatican to protect it, which led to a relatively peaceful occupation and liberation. No one, perhaps not even the Nazis, wanted to be responsible for destroying that historic city.
The 1945 Italian film Rome, Open City, directed by Roberto Rossellini, takes place during the Nazi occupation of Rome. It was one of the first post-war Italian films to gain major acclaim internationally.
The ARC women were some of the first Americans to move into Rome. Before Allied troops started coming in, they had the city almost to themselves and set about seeing all the tourist sights. Flo wanted to see all the famous architectural treasures she had read about as a child.
From a report in the Yakima Herald-Republic:
Life in the Italian theatre of war can be fun as well as hard work for American Red Cross workers, Miss Florence Wick told her mother, Mrs. Gerda Wick of Yakima, in a recent letter.
“So much and so many exciting things have happened since I left home that I can’t believe any of it yet,” Miss Wick said. “This last event is the biggest dream yet. I am writing this in my new home, which is a beautiful, spacious Italian villa. We four girls moved in yesterday from our dusty camp down the road and have the whole villa and grounds to ourselves.
“There is a bathroom and bedroom for each of us and we truly live like princesses in a fairy tale. The villa belongs to a very wealthy Italian, who is an anti-fascist, who lost his whole family to the Germans. He loves to do favors for us.”
High praise for Capt. Harold Haines of Yakima was voiced by the Red Cross woman.
“Capt. Haines is something of a hero over here,” she said. “Fighting in a war does things like ‘knocking off’ officers and men, but Haines is one of the very few original officers left. Yakima should be very proud of him. His own men are and that’s the acid test out here.”
The nice weather makes it even more pleasant to drive around the various areas to serve the men, Miss Wick said. Because the unit is not yet equipped to turn out doughnuts for all the men, she has had time to visit interesting places she has read about but never expected to see. Mt. Vesuvius and the ancient city of Pompeii are among the sights she has seen.
“I don’t know how long we will be in this beautiful place,” Miss Wick said, “but we are going to enjoy it as long as we do stay. No doubt we will be roughing it again in a tent or bombed out building before long. I won’t mind that if I get to stay with this grand division.”
The ARC women didn’t stay in the villa in Rome very long. By July 9 Flo is back in the camp, writing in her diary about cleaning their tent.

I posted a picture on twitter yesterday from one of my World History lessons where students perform an “autopsy” on the Roman Empire that garnered some attention.
A number of teachers asked for details of the lesson, so rather than try and explain it out in 140 characters several times to several different people, I just decided to put my write up here.
First: Obviously the medical gear is not required for the lesson. But I will say, if you’re willing to drop about $35 per class, it actually made a difference. This was the first year I added that piece to the lesson (based on student requests from last year), and it definitely played a role in helping get “in character” for performing an autopsy.
The major objective of the lesson is to have students demonstrate the ability to evaluate multiple historical perspectives on why the Roman Empire collapsed and form their own interpretation on why Rome fell based on the available evidence.
This could easily be accomplished without an autopsy — I could hand them sources and treat it as a document analysis assignment. But I was looking for something that was a little out in left field (those are the things that stick, right?) and required group collaboration to help vocalize the thought processes necessary for good historical analysis.
Lesson Origins
I will not take credit for this lesson idea. This is a common lesson shared among AP World History teachers. In the original form that I saw, students were asked to conduct autopsies on the “Gunpowder Empires” (Safavid, Mughal, Ottoman Empires). Some teachers also did it for classical empires (like Rome and Han China). So if you like the concept but not my execution, please go look at other iterations of the lesson. You can just google search “AP World Empire Autopsy” and see tons of examples.
I decided to narrow it down to just Rome because I wanted to have follow up conversations about the collapse of Rome based on their competing interpretations. I usually give student groups at least some unique historical arguments to help produce different results. So I wanted a more in depth approach to Rome versus the broad based comparative option with the original lesson.
I also wanted a lesson I could use in either my regular or AP sections of World History. I’m really big on the idea that both classes should emphasize the same skills and concepts, and that the only difference is the level of rigor. I don’t want the idea of developing historical thinking skills to be reserved for just one subset of my students.
Materials Used
Set Up Lecture
I walk them through the chronology of Rome’s collapse. As I explain it to the students, I’m going to establish time of death, they’re going to establish what killed Rome. So we go over the Crisis of the Third Century, Diocletian, Constantine, the East/West split, all the way to the final fall of Rome in 476. We cover the increased use of Germanic troops in the Roman army a little bit, because otherwise Odoacer does not make much sense to the students.
Initial Interpretation Analysis
I have a word document that has summaries of many of the theories for Rome’s collapse compiled together. I made it so there are even page breaks — no summary goes over one page. Some pages may have 2 or 3 different theories if they have shorter explanations. Each student in the group is expected to look at 1–2 pages and take notes on the main arguments.
A couple group members will need to head out into the hallway or some other space to trace the body outlines on the paper. When they’re done they come back in and read over some of the interpretations. What I usually do to distribute the work load is have the folks that stay in the room the whole time read 2 pages, and the folks that went out into the hall read 1.
Group Discussion and List Building
After they’ve had time to read through and make their observations, have them come together as a group and share what they found. I put the list of what body parts these “injuries” would correspond to:
I encourage students to get creative on the type of injury that they are identifying. Is it a minor issue? Maybe that’s a bruise. Major issue? Broken bone. Don’t give the students too much guidance because they get pretty creative on their own. For example, a group identified a shutdown of intestine functions to represent sharp decline in farm output in the empire.
Give them a few minutes to have this conversation, and then it is time to conduct the autopsy.
The “Autopsy”
The students lay their body outline down on the tables and begin marking it up with corresponding injuries. I show them that on most autopsy reports, they simply circle the site of the injury and then write commentary on what the injury is. That is what I expect for them on theirs, although some like to draw in the actual injury (so students draw broken bones, or one group drew kidneys that were a gross brown to represent kidney failure) and I’m fine with that.
The students have laptops that can flip into tablets, so many of them had their notes up on a google doc that they used for reference while they marked up the body.
Students are still deliberating about where to place injuries at this point — and that is totally okay. I try to be active around the room and interject into conversations either to validate their observation OR to encourage them to think of some different angles (e.g. for example, a group mentioned Constantine in reference to the rise of Christianity, because some historical interpretations argue Christianity contributed to the downfall of Rome. I pressed them to think about how Constantine may have contributed to a spinal injury … and they looked back and made the connection to him ending Diocletian’s tetrarchy).
As they wind down marking up the body, students have to pull up their shared google doc with the autopsy report and mark down what injuries they noted on the body (I have them do this step because they will often slim down or modify the list from what they originally developed as they’re actually mapping the injuries out on the body).
Conclusion
Once they are done, they take off the gear and turn in their body maps. They then sit down as a group and finish the google doc. Under the Opinion section, they need to develop a thorough analysis of cause of death. I usually specify the following requirements:
This is the most challenging part, but it is well worth the student results. They are engaging in a critically important historical skill, and rather than just memorizing a list of reasons why Rome ended, they’re actually being challenged to answer the question themselves.
I have about 60 minutes for this activity. Usually students start formulating their conclusion but need time the next day to finish. I use this as a pivot to discuss the next day and then introduce the Byzantines.

I’ve never been to Rome, but I know that I struggle with crowded places, and how the crowds don’t seem to change much even out of season in many tourist spots. Rome definitely sounds like a once only experience!

I traveled through Europe, and I’ve been home a month now. Contrary to what I’d expected, my time away only made me more acutely aware of just how beautiful it is here… this little piece of California, where I grew up.
Not that the things I saw in Europe were any less beautiful. No; there, I saw things I could never have imagined, things that took my breath away with their utter unexpectedness and newness (oldness, really, but all new to me). But I think I’ve come back with a kinder, more appreciative eye. I got in the habit, while traveling, of perceiving the wonder in everything; now, when I look around the place where I grew up, I’m pausing more to reflect, to capture memories as if with a camera, and not forget.
Here, at home, the hills are a deep green this time of year; we’re starting to get a few of those summery days that are just barely too hot, but then perfect all evening long; children are riding their bicycles in the street and laughing like they can feel the school year coming to its end. The other day, I walked by a big Mexican bush sage, and the smell brought back a thousand memories of childhood, of playing in the backyard with my sisters long after dark, when we had our own bush of that sweet-smelling, lavender-colored plant. And as much as I adored my travels, much as I already can’t wait to go again someday, and hard as it was to leave, I did miss the context I have here at home: the memories that come with all the smells and sights and tastes. The memories of my life, memories of me.
And the truth, I found, is that one of the things I loved most about the lush greenery, rolling countrysides, and swaying olive trees in Italy was how much it reminded me of home.
•••
I miss Italy. I missed it as soon as I left it. It’s in no way very original of me; most people I’ve talked to who have ever visited there say the exact same thing. But there really is just something magnetizing about it to us American folks.
I set up my base in Venice and Florence, but did have the chance to see two other Italian cities — only for one day each, mind you, but with the impression they made on me, it only seems fair I give them their own post here. For one day, I saw Rome, and for one day, I saw Milan. Sometime — I hope sooner rather than later — I’ll go back to Italy, and make it much longer than just two more days.
•••
I almost didn’t go to Rome. I had long planned that I would take a day trip from Florence and make the pilgrimage, but found I loved Florence so much that I didn’t want to spare a moment from it. In the end, I tore myself away and hopped the train — because how can you go all the way to Europe and not see Rome? — and I’m so, so glad I did.
Rome is often called the Eternal City, and it is every bit deserving of such a grandiose name. As I walked through the busy downtown, observing the perfect coexistence of ancient ruins, modern buildings, and everything in between, I felt that there really was something eerily eternal about this place. Structures from 2,000 years ago stand as though nothing ever changed, utterly undeterred by the passage of time, the rising and falling of empires and regimes, the growth of a whole new society around them — or the nosy wanderings of tourists like me, seeking to get a glimpse into the heart of this place, what so many of us learn is the birthplace of our modern world.
First laying eyes on the Colosseum was surreal. The only thing I can think to compare it to, though obviously I have never had this experience, is that moment that astronauts first see Earth from space: a rush of feelings, mostly it’s real, and I’m really seeing this, and we really are so, so small. Because faced with something that’s survived two millennia, how can you feel any other way?
Of course, thinking of just how many people and animals died horrifically in the Colosseum, all for the entertainment of others, adds a whole other layer to the experience of beholding this long-standing and impressive place. I reflected a lot, while I was there, on our own humanity — are we really much better today? We like to think of history as being synonymous with progress, with always getting better, but we are certainly willing to excuse a lot of suffering from our fellow human beings, all in the name of being entertained, aren’t we?
But then, that’s another conversation, entirely.
As exciting as it was to see the Colosseum, stumbling upon the Pantheon — because stumble is exactly what I did — was even more bizarre. While the Colosseum, Palatine Hill, and the Forum all stand somewhat set apart from Rome’s main city center — preserved in their own sort of ancient “neighborhood” — the Pantheon is just right there, downtown, surrounded by restaurants, apartments, and businesses of our modern age. You would almost miss it, assume it was a replica or even just an especially pretty building, if you weren’t looking for it (and I was looking, and still almost walked on by).
If my hometown provides me context for myself, and my own beginnings, Rome gave me some of that for all of us—for humanity. Not that we all descended from the Romans, or that our forms of government and society were all influenced by them; rather, being in the Eternal City, seeing this strange marriage of the old and the new, brought me to reflect on — despite how young humanity is compared to most of the universe — just how long we’ve been here. Surely it’s been long enough now that there’s no excuse to still embrace the kind of violence that the Romans loved watching in the Colosseum. I hope that, the longer we stick around, we will keep trying to get better.
•••
It would be disingenuous of me not to admit the biggest reason I was determined to visit Rome, and it had nothing to do with ancient history. I have wanted to see the city for years because of a certain Romantic poet who spent his last few months, and ultimately died, there.
I was sixteen when I first started reading John Keats. Fascinated at that age by his beautiful yet doomed romance with Fanny Brawne, I upheld a thing of beauty is a joy forever (from his “Endymion”) as a life motto, and longed to write the way he could. I took a class on English Romanticism in undergrad and felt almost like I was “cheating” on Keats with how much I unexpectedly ended up loving Coleridge’s work; still, “Ode to a Nightingale” reigned supreme as my favorite poem (it’s still way up there). And since I discovered him, I’ve been troubled by his tragic early death, but I really could not have predicted how much visiting his museum in Rome was going to affect me.
It’s called the Keats-Shelley House — as it’s dedicated not just to Keats but to all the Romantic writers, including Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley. The rosy-orange house stands, quiet and unassuming, right beside the Spanish Steps. When Keats began to deteriorate, his doctors sent him out of England to take the warmer climate in Rome, hoping that would restore him to health; he moved into this house in late 1820. He was dead in four months. He was 25.
When I first read Keats, at 16 years old, 25 sounded almost old to me. Now, I’m 25. And God, his life was only starting. Many scholars say that had he lived longer, he would have surpassed Shakespeare as the best and most prolific writer in the English language. He was a baby.
When I visited the museum, I got to see the room where he died. It’s small, with a fireplace, a desk, a bed, and two little windows, one of which overlooks the Spanish Steps. His illness did not deter him from enjoying the view, and he liked to look out at all the activity below, especially the bubbling clear waters of the square’s boat fountain (which is still there today). He died of tuberculosis, though his doctors resisted that diagnosis until the very end; and as a result, he was refused ample pain medication, and died suffering, terribly. That was really, really hard to learn, especially while standing in the same room where it all happened. I felt, suddenly, a little sick, and I wanted to cry, but I couldn’t.
But it isn’t fair to remember him, or anyone, just for his death. The museum does an excellent job of reminding visitors who Keats and his contemporaries were — that, though now they are all gone, they were once full of the gorgeous vibrancy of life, and created beautiful art that will never, ever die.
I learned that, despite the image we have today of a perpetually fragile and delicate Keats, he was a scrappy little guy in school, getting into many a fistfight before he discovered what good outlets reading and writing were. I learned how much he loved his siblings — he was the oldest, like me — and how much it devastated him when his little brother, Tom, died of tuberculosis at 19 (John had nursed him, as these were, of course, days before it was known to be contagious). I learned that, before he went to Rome to die, he charged his fiancée Fanny and his younger sister to always stay in touch, so they would have each other; and I learned that the two women did, and remained best friends for the rest of their long lives. I even saw a lock of his hair, and learned that despite my own vision of John Keats as a brooding brunette, he was, in fact, a towhead blonde.
Hardly anyone left that museum with a dry eye. It’s not easy subject matter, and they do an incredible job making it all come alive and feel real. But I left feeling hopeful, in a way, because what an incredible thing it is that so many people are still impacted by his story, and his art.
One older Italian woman, who was visiting at the same time as me, kept clutching her chest and rhapsodically saying, “oh, me amo Keats, me amo Keats.” I hope that, somehow, the wonder of the Eternal City allowed him to hear that, and to know how much he means.
•••
Perhaps knowing how reluctant I was to leave Italy, the universe conspired to keep me there an extra day. My plan to visit Bern, the capital of Switzerland, was foiled by weekend rail strikes on ItaliaRail, and I ended up stranded for a night in Milan.
It was quite the stroke of luck, because I absolutely loved Milan. More similar to Berlin than anywhere I visited in Italy, this city was like a hub of art, youth culture, and progressive modernity. I walked to the canal in the late afternoon to soak in the last light; there were young people smoking cigarettes atop brick walls covered in graffiti, and a street market full of vendors selling handmade gifts. I bought a pair of earrings for my sister, then wandered until after dark, trying to savor my last few hours here… this country I had come to love so much.
•••
Indeed, Italy was somewhere I had always known that I would love, but I guess I couldn’t have imagined how much. At the Keats-Shelley House, there was a list of American and British artists, writers, and thinkers who, at one point or another, made Rome their home, and it just went on and on. Longfellow, Dickens, Alcott, Browning, Copley, Ruskin. Keats, of course, though I know he must have wished it was under happier circumstances; still, he loved that view of the Spanish Steps, so much.
There’s just something about you, Italy, that inspires one to create, I think — and to make oneself at home. How else would I still be writing about you a month-and-a-half later, still thinking of you when I see my own home’s green hills, rolling countrysides, and olive trees?
•••
ROME
Activities: Visit the Colosseum and the Roman Forum (tip: plan ahead! the lines were excruciatingly long, and I didn’t have time to go in; buy tickets online so you can skip the lines). See the Trevi Fountain (tip: go in the morning, before the crowds arrive, or else you may have trouble even seeing much of that gorgeous, cool, clear water!). Go to the Keats-Shelley House and the Spanish Steps (this museum was so impactful and beautiful, and all in English; and the Spanish Steps are like their own separate world within Rome, just a gorgeous neighborhood).
My Best Meal: I only ate once in Rome, stopping in a little grocery and grabbing a salame and fontina panini. But let me tell you! That was one delicious panini. As with everywhere in Italy, there are a thousand restaurants every where you look and everyone is guaranteed to be amazing; wander off the main tourist tracks to find somewhere more affordable.
MILAN
My Hostel: QUO Milano / Cost: about 25 euros a night / Recommend?: Yes! Great common area, cute decor, nice room (we had our own bathroom, as well), and very affordable. It’s a tram ride from the train station, but all the main points of interest in the city are walking distance.
Activities: Go see the Milan Cathedral, walk by the canal, look closely at the street art, and talk to people (everyone was so kind in Milan).
My Best Meal: A Sicilian cannoli! One of the best desserts I had the entire trip. Stop into any given bakery as you walk the city, and I promise it will be delicious.

In my last article, I wrote about getting from FCO (Rome’s largest Airport) to Termini (Rome’s central train station which also serves as a major hub for Rome’s public transportation).
Of course, it leaves the question, “What if I arrive in Rome at the CIA (Ciampino Airport)?”
Great question, reader!
If you’re not familiar with budget flights by low-cost carriers like RyanAir, EasyJet, and the no-longer-bankrupt Norwegian Airlines, then let me offer a small introduction.
Your friend told you that they found a $5 flight from Paris to Berlin. “Crazy,” you think.
Then you go to Skyscanner (affiliate link) and find out that isn’t such a stretch.
In fact, I found an $11 flight from Paris’s BVA to Tangier, Morocco leaving October 13, 2022. This is just one of many examples.
“What a deal!” you think.

""Let me tell you about Rome, my beloved Roma, so ancient she is called eternal, the city that has always been and will always be. Assured of her own magnificence, her venerable significance, she does not seek comparison - and yet I find it almost impossible not to compare her.""
This is the opening of Mark Lamprell’s The Lovers' Guide to Rome and I fell in love with these words immediately. I was compelled to read them aloud, they have a wonderful lyrical quality to them.
Have you ever been to Rome? The author’s note says this novel was written outdoors, around the streets and piazzas of Rome and it shows. There is a lovely liveliness and intimacy in the treatment of these locations that took me right back there amongst the stone angels and gelato stands.
This book was given to me with the description that it was a ""happy book"". As most of my reading material tends toward more UNhappy themes, I thought this might be a nice (and mentally healthy) change.
I was pleasantly surprised. The Lovers' Guide to Rome is a lovely, breezy, sunlit romp through the streets of Roma, as comfortable and cheerful as the best rom-coms, but beautifully written, with descriptions that make you want to read them aloud. I found the cast of characters engaging, with enough about them to be curious about and sympathise with, to make me want to read on.
I zipped through the first half on this on a two hour train journey and it was ideal for the task. Because you shouldn't have to put up with poorly written junk just because you're in the mood for something light!

I was in Rome standing outside St. Peter’s basilica when a thought crossed my mind: Am I entering a church or a museum? I was perfectly at bliss standing in line to enter one of the most famous architecture in the world. As I wandered through its interior, the more confused I was. Can this be considered as an art gallery? I had musings in my head to fill a notebook.
I had little knowledge about the church. I was astounded to discover it has eight chapels, 24 altars, and about 40 statues. I was bowled over by its grandeur. The moment I looked up, it was hard to look down. Why would you? The hymns and prayers seemed to be coming from above.
Two reasons drew me to the place. One was the movie ‘Da Vinci Code’ starring Tom Hanks as the lead Robert Langdon; the other was my running away from my problems.
Though I was raised with an amalgamation of Islam, Catholicism, Hindu and Buddhism, the basilicas in Rome offered me comfort that remains inexplicable. They called to me. Maybe it was the beauty of their architecture that drew me to them like a moth to a flame. Some questions are best left unanswered.
All I knew was I had made it to Rome. I was finally at bliss looking up 60 feet towards the…

Walk down the jet bridge in your comfy cute style, ready for your first day in Rome. Just skip packing your Gucci python print heels on this escapade.
You can look stylish wandering Rome by looking at number-two of these 12 Rome tips without looking like the goofy tourist in your wanderlust.
We chose to fly to Roma on Easter weekend for our very first time. I’m in-touch with the crazier ideas when it comes to traveling and now know how to keep you from looking the out-of-sorts maniacal traveler.
Easter weekend — in the Catholic capitol — we thought, “Lets visit Rome!”
One-step-nuttier…We added a tour of the Vatican on the list!? {Go off the high dive of nuts — or don’t go at all!}
If you knew my Hubs, this sort of crazy optimism wouldn’t be so shocking. He’s an “all-in”, “it’ll be fine” kinda guy.
And if you don’t make it into Vatican City, there’s always a gelateria nearby ready to serve it’s oh-so-sweet-goodness. Gelato makes everything better!
On to the gelato! {Plus the 12 tips}
If you’re traveling to Rome, these are the 12 best travel tips to keep you from looking like the nutter tourist…
The midday rest hours is a thang in Italy, but slowly drinking your coffee is not. Order your frothy cappuccino or caffè macchiato {an espresso with a splash of milk} at the bar, take your receipt to pick up your cuppa, and drink up. Sitting down at a table to leisurely drink can double your bill {table service fee}.
The cobblestone streets of Rome are part of its old world charm. You’ll be doing a lot of walking along those cobblestone streets, and heels don’t fit this trip {they do fit nicely in the cobblestone cracks and break your heels though}. Save your cute spikes for your Asheville weekend.
There are good walking-around stylish shoes to pack for walking Rome::
When you pop into the small boutiques or family-owned shops, greet the owner {most small shops or artisan workshops are operated by the owners}. Greet them with “Buongiorno” {good day} until afternoon and “buonasera” {good evening} after. {Ciao is an easy hi/bye, if that’s what you’re looking for}.
No need to rattle off Eat, Pray, Love in Italian, but making an effort to speak the language goes a long way in ANY COUNTRY you visit {except for maybe France. Depending on who you try it with, they can get a bit testy}.
As with ANY TRAVELING, keep an eye on your bags. In crowded areas {and all of Rome’s popular sites are overflowing with people}, carry your bags on your front or use a protected travel backpack like this one.
SIDE STYLE TIP:: Belt bags are the new fanny packs 😉 I bought mine in the wine color because it’s purty. But turns out it’s a BRILLIANT CHOICE if you’re a wine spiller too 🙋🏼‍♀️ {anyone else raising their hand?}
We are walkers most of the time, but getting to certain places in Rome requires wheels. The city buses were those wheels that Easter trip. Buy your tickets ahead of time because they DO NOT sell tickets on the bus.
Buy tickets at any tabaccheria in the city. Shops are designated with a large “T”. Tickets are €1.50 each, or choose a 24-hour, 48-hour, or weekly ticket for a discounted price. Tickets are valid for all public transportation in Rome (bus, metro, tram and local train).
Bypass the lines and purchase tickets to the more popular sites AHEAD OF TIME. Many of these sell out quickly. Do a little planning ahead and buy your tickets online before your trip. { Vatican and Sistine Chapel, Colosseum, St Peter’s Dome & Basilica tour are big hits}
You don’t need a ticket to visit Trevi Fountain, but it’s wildly popular and not much fun squishing your way through a ka-jillion of your closest strangers. Grab your cappuccino and make that your first view of the day.
OORRRR, make a night stop to see it under all the beautiful lights. We did both, and 18/19 tourists agree…nighttime viewing is best, mainly because…fewer peeps standing around in your photos 📷
We ran out of time, but one tour that’ll be on our 2024 trip itinerary is the traditional pasta-making and wine tour in Frascati {40-min train ride from Rome}.
Since the pandemic, credit cards aren’t the frowned upon payment they once were, but good ol’ coin still reigns supreme — especially in smaller-run businesses.
Keep some on hand during your trip.
One of THE BEST parts of foreign travel is the exposure to other cultures. Dinner in Rome might be one of those adjustments, unless you’re a snacking queen like myself🤗
Dining and drinking are rituals in Italy. Don’t rush. First, enjoy an aperitivo. You’re meeting up for a pre-dinner drink and light eats {similar to Happy Hour} at 7pm, after a day of sight-seeing.
However, don’t eat too much Italian deliciousness, because dinner follows around 8, 9, or even 10pm.
Might want to grab an extra caffè macchiato for your long Roman days to keep moving until dinner, or take a midday rest {riposa} like the locals, from 1–3-ish.
This Art of Aperitivo post will help you fit in with the locals at aperitivo time.
Anytime + all-the-time is when you look for your next gelateria to try a new flavor. DO NOT LEAVE ROME without trying at least one flavor, no, five…maybe six. Depends on the season, since they keep rotating.
Order the house wine –you’ll love it– and don’t expect pizza drowning in sauce.
It’s the simple cooking that makes Italian foods mouth-watering, along with the extra pounds you’ll pack home with you. 😬
Enjoy it the way it comes. Don’t ask for sauces {I see you, ranch lovers} or try to salt your capressi or bruschetta into a cardiac arrest.
Yes, Italians love their pastas, pastries, and pizza {as well as coffee, wine, and gelato…}. But believe it or not, there are also salad and vegetable options. Look under “CONTORNI” on the menus {their side dishes}.
Always, always, for the love of Italy, save space for dessert + your after-dinner-sip of limoncello.
That said, you’ll want to put foreign phone service on at least one phone in your party. Wi-fi can be spotty at hotels and cafés.
If you’re using your phone for directions on your trip, pay extra to add on foreign service {or check out the BONUS TIP BELOW}.
Whenever we’ve gone international with our teens, they didn’t have phone service. I’m a mama who has her kids back! No Snap notifications, texts, games… BEST TRIPS EVVV-ER!

When the modern man is on break at work, does he ever wonder about Rome? What would it be like to live in Rome? In this article, I will answer these burning questions. We shall explore the fascinating world of ancient Rome and her people, starting with the lowest classes — the slaves — working towards the freedman, the artisans, the patrician class, and finally, the emperor and his family.
To keep our imagination engaged, we shall compare pagan Rome with Christian Rome — their customs, laws, and government. Let us see how they compare.
Pagan Rome, like many before and after her, assigned her citizens into a ‘caste’ system; that is, whichever caste or part of society you were born into, that is where you stayed… period. No one from the lower castes — slaves and poor merchants — could move up the social hierarchy without the nobility’s sign-off. However, there was one unique citizen (this did depend on who their former master was) who enjoyed more perks than the patrician class. Former slaves, called freedmen, would wonder about the empire trying to start a new life. For the vast majority, life was still hard and full of suffering. The emperor’s former slaves had it differently. Ambition and ego caused distrust between family members and the royal house: many emperors trusted their household slaves more than their family members and senators. This was especially true for the tyrannical emperors.
To counter potential plots and schemes, many emperors, the most infamous of which was Claudius, would assign essential matters of the crown to their loyal, well-educated freedmen. In a tavern or banquet, one could hear about Claudius sending his freedmen on diplomatic duties to a senator he despised. Robert Knapp, in his book Invisible Romans, gives us an idea of the attitude of Roman elites,
The hatred of imperial freedmen especially, but uppity freedmen in general, brought scathing opprobrium to focus on this societal group. To keep them at bay, they were disparaged as forever despised, inferior; they were marked by law and custom as unworthy of mixing with the elite in politics or marriage or anything (pg. 171).
Under Roman law, slaves had no intrinsic, God-given value while in bondage. (Christ and His teachings did mark a change in Roman society towards slaves. Gradually, slaves became known as ‘serfs’, a class with limited rights under the law — nevertheless, it was a step in the right direction. The ‘citizen’ held the right of sovereignty (participation in politics), which was reserved for Rome’s patrician class — especially during the empire, as Augustus ensured this was the case. Any citizen of Rome, from the emperor to a wealthy freedman, could own slaves. (However, freedmen were banned from holding political offices.) The practice was not limited to the patrician class. Roman citizens could do whatever they wanted with their property, and many did.
In pagan Rome, religion played a meditating role between ruler and ruled. Barbarian tribes became Romanized over the generations thanks to a Roman policy of sending chieftain sons to Rome for schooling. A Roman teacher could draw similarities and suggest that Romans and barbarians worshipped the same gods under different names. Polytheistic religions are helpful in this regard — the gods of Rome dominate. Yet, there are no significant differences in terms of teachings on how to live the good life in polytheistic religions. Also worthy of note is the caste system. Caste systems — the ordering of society — did exist outside of Rome’s borders. In principle, barbarians ordered their kingdoms in much the same way as the Romans; the only difference was who stood at the top. In Rome: the emperors and his nobles. In Germany: a Germanic chieftain and his nobles.
Before Christ and His teachings began to ring through the ears of Rome’s elite, preaching a life, by authority of the Ten Commandments, of modesty and chastity for both sexes. Pagan Rome’s idea of happiness and meaning is found in worshipping The Self. Biblical religion, unlike Pagans, is a willingness to submit their will to the Lord: a living, just and holy God outside of time and space who communes with man via the Holy Spirit. One can have a relationship with Him by following His Commandments, his Son’s teachings, and listening to His spirit — the Holy Spirit.
Because of the lack of Commandments in Pagan religions, people would worship particular gods of this phenomenon or archetype. Meaning they would pray to the sky, sea, or earth, all phenomenon inside Creation. Therefore, if you wanted to live your life in the pursuit of pleasure, you would find yourself a member of the Dionysian cult — the god of wine and pleasure. Every pagan god, the Christians would claim, is nothing more than an archetype of human nature or Creation; therefore, if one chooses to worship Dionysus or ISIS (the Great Mother Goddess), one becomes Dionysus or ISIS. Morality becomes subjective as these gods are not lawgivers or the revelation of Truth in the cosmos.
Consequently, people worship whichever deity they believe will bless them the most. Pagans choose which gods to worship to serve their own needs. In the Christian paradigm, all humans are under the Lord’s authority whether they like it or not, and acts of sin (like idolatry) will lead us down a path filled with lies and misery.
Public baths are an excellent case study as they give us some idea of Rome’s impression of nudity. The Caesars would try to outbid each other with their public works buildings, a favourite being public baths. During the empire, the sexes were separated from one another, depending on the number of scandals. However, it must be noted that the law was changed because too many people got caught fornicating. It was not a decision born of Biblical principles: man’s propensity to sin forced the empire to act.
To sum up, Pagan Rome’s view on sex was very liberal. State-sponsored brothels and Dionysian parties did indeed occur regularly. The lack of moral values in pagan religions meant the state tolerated this behaviour, only interfering if things of out of hand. In pagan Rome, one could complain about this despicable behaviour, but the state would not legislate against such behaviour. Many have probably attended such festivities and were unwilling to take the risk. Prior to Christianity, sexual sins were part of the higher culture — which only got worse as Rome began to expand her borders. Republican senators of the empire, inspired by the likes of Cato and the Stoics, longed for the long-forgotten values that made Rome. Her men have been corrupted by the pleasures she has to offer.
The courts in Rome during the Republic were mainly dominated by one particular faction, family, or alliance. Rome’s republican government was designed to stop the tyrannical will of one man, which it did pretty well. However, ambitious men serving the will of Rome would rule through alliances and ‘favours’ owned by men they helped, receiving special treatment and privileges. Sulla is one such example. Nepotism was hard to combat in such a system due to the lack of a rival branch of government: control over Rome’s legions was all one needed.
The caste system in Roman society made it hard for everyday men and women to prosecute someone above their station. I imagine freedmen and artisans (like blacksmiths) did not take crimes committed by nobles to the courts — they had no money nor the will to do so. Very often, in such situations, another member of the patrician class would stand in on behalf of the lower classes. Usually, to the detriment of his standing within Rome’s elites, one ought not to spend time with slaves and peasants. During the Republic, a Stoic senator who governed Sicily so well the Sicilians wanted to make him an honorary Sicilian managed to find himself in court.
What is the charge, you ask? Jealousy. Rivals jealous of our senator’s competencies and deserved admiration from his peers, his rivals, filled with the spirit of Kane, wanted nothing more than to witness his fall from grace. The kangaroo court sentenced him to exile. Roman law and legislators only applied to Roman citizens — leaving the rest to be exploited — and anyone challenging the status quo would meet the same faith as our senator.
Not much changed during the reign of the Caesars. The nature of monarchical governments — where one man’s will is enacted throughout the government — is seen as divine and just, as the emperor was considered a living god. An opposition voice or party being considered in the Senate is unlikely. No man would dare question the emperor’s divine will unless he was willing to part with his head. Monarchical systems can work well… it all depends on the grace and disposition of the emperor. Plato’s Republic was the model for ancient kings and emperors: over the years, many attempts were made to live up to the ideal of the philosopher-king, although most never came close to the title. Plato claimed that men of philosophy made the best rulers. Marcus Aurelius is a good example. However, many did give in to sin and thus became evil rulers of themselves and their subjects.
The law did begin to change thanks to Christian ethics. The story of Moses freeing the Jews from bondage was no longer told to Jewish children. Greek and Latin were the common languages in the Roman Empire. The story of God leading Moses and the Jews out of Egypt could, thanks in part to the Romans, reach every ear within her border. In effect, the Biblical ethos told through the prophets of the Bible eventually influenced, at first, Rome’s culture and customs as more and more people started to see reality through the eyes of Christ. This would lead to a change in the law justified by Biblical ethics. One would ponder: is this law Christ-like?
Tell me, dear reader, would you last a day in Pagan Rome?

«Governing the Italians is not difficult; it’s useless.»
This made-up quote has been falsely attributed to various historical figures: the fascist dictator Mussolini, the politician Giovanni Giolitti, and even Winston Churchill.
But the phrase contains an element of truth, as it’ll be apparent the moment you arrive in Italy’s capital.
It’s way dirtier and scruffier than a big European capital city has any right to be.
Especially one that charges every visitor who stays overnight 7.50€ of city tax per day.
The traffic (and the noise and pollution it generates) is atrocious, to the point that, at times, it made even a lifelong gearhead like me wish cars were never invented.
But try using public transport, and you quickly realize why there are so many cars around. Just two metro lines (plus one under…

I’ve never felt like this when going to the Italian capital. This sense of inadequacy, to be surrounded by misery at every corner and corruption.
“Maybe I was ignoring it all and just focusing on its helpless fascination when I lived here in 2017 for a semester and during subsequent visits?” I ponder as I exit the Roma Termini station and start heading to a coffee shop for breakfast — of course, a croissant and cappuccino.
I need to head to the American embassy later on to get my visa approved to go to the US. To do so, I’ll cross a big chunk of the city center by foot.
I can’t get out of my mind the stats I recently heard on an Italian investigative journalism program (the last bastion of seriousness in an otherwise trash-populated TV):
80%, perhaps 90% of business activities in Rome are in the hands of mafia.
80, 90%.
There is a chance that I had breakfast in one of their bars, and very likely later on, I will have lunch in another one too.
Businesses of any type are utilized by various…

A Place to Be Funny Without Being a Jerk

January 3, 2022|Italy
Today, I walked through the heart of non-ancient Rome. Twice. The first time solo and in the daylight. The second time after sunset with Boo.
I started the day with what has become my Italian hobby — doing laundry. You may think that we are extra dirty or changing our clothes several times a day, but the truth is that European washing machines are shockingly tiny. I can only do about a quarter of what would be a load in my big honking American washer. I shudder to think what families with children must do about laundry here in Europe. The washing machine must run 24/7. That’s been nearly the case for us, and we’re just two relatively clean adult women (although we’ve had our moments). And there’s generally no clothes dryer which means that everything has to be painstakingly laid out to dry.
God bless America and its gigantic appliances.
Anyway, we slept late, and my travel companion decided that she wanted some down time — which was totally fine with me. I told her she could stay in the apartment while I wandered around.

Last Fall, I started thinking about bucket list trips. I’m not getting any younger, and I’m seeing minor blips in a formerly well-running system. I have a chronic leg injury that can make mobility a challenge on certain days. On top of that, the world is in a state where travel is becoming stickier, even amongst long-time allies.
I figured in the next five to seven years, I should focus on doing a few big trips that matter to me, the places I’d be disappointed if I didn’t get to see. That way, if a day comes when international travel isn’t a great idea for me anymore, I’ll have no regrets.
For my first of these trips, I pondered several spots, but Italy always held a huge lead. I’ve been fortunate enough to see a lot of Europe, but hadn’t yet gotten to the boot. As a solo traveler, I’ve felt intimidated to go somewhere I don’t speak the language. But Italy is a tourist mecca, so I knew they’d cater to North Americans. Plus, apps like Google Translate make that stuff less worrisome.
In real life, I’m not the kind to flock to hot, happening places. Toronto always has a cool new restaurant, but I don’t like waiting in lines and sitting elbow-to-elbow while I eat my overpriced deconstructed…

Vatican City, the smallest sovereign state in the world, is a walled enclave in the city of Rome
Rome, the capital of Italy, is a multi-faceted place. From the erstwhile Roman Empire to the present day capital of modern Italy, Rome has been among the big names in must see places in Europe. It has been in literature in the form of all time famous maxims: ‘Rome was not built in a day’, ‘While Rome was burning, Nero was playing his fiddle’ and ‘When in Rome do as the Romans do’ and on the Hollywood film scene with block busters like ‘Fall of the Roman Empire’ and ‘Roman holiday’. Roman English is also in common use. Rome is not burning any more and the infamous Nero is long gone. Unlike the Mughal and the Soviet Empires the Roman Empire re-emerged from the ashes and the Roman holiday is very much on. A trip to Italy, in this context, will be long remembered.
Far from stereotypical Mediterranean, Italy’s climate varies from place to place. We landed at Rome International Airport under a heavily overcast sky. It was actually a light drizzle that we encountered on arrival from Athens and that reminded me of a friend who had visited Rome a couple of years ago but could enjoy it only from his hotel window. He believed in the famous verse:
Aaye kuchh abr kuchh sharaab aaye
Being averse to sedentary life style and drinking, I was really worried about the impending continuity of the inclement weather in the next few days. Though the sun remained under the cloud cover during most of our stay in Italy, to our good luck, the rain did not disrupt our programme any further and we moved around at will.
A Republic since 1946, Italy consists of the mainland Italian peninsula and two large Mediterranean islands namely Sicily and Sardinia further south and enclaves the sovereign states of Vatican and San Marino, the later, lesser known to the outside world, being the 5th smallest state both by area and population. After the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the victorious Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II was the first of the rulers of the Ottoman Empire to assume the title ‘Caesar of the Roman Empire’.
We had planned a trip to about half a dozen European destinations in slightly less than four weeks time and had to budget-plan our outings. A friend very kindly handed me a book ‘Europe 20 Dollars a day’ (It was an old addition, the latest being Europe 50 Dollars a day) and this book really proved very handy with the minutest of the travel details and tips. We booked a place in a pension, French style boarding house, at competitive rates, on the National Street, mid way between the city centre and the Rome railway station. There could not have been a better location to see the historic city.
Sprawling over seven hills, the city of Rome has River Tiber flowing through the city centre. Incidentally most of the heritage sites were located close to where we were staying and when the tour operators gave a strike call, on the fateful day we had reserved for the city tour, we made good use of the book mentioned earlier. Taxis with English speaking cabbies were very expensive so we used public transport for site seeing. The bus tickets were not sold on board but had to be purchased from the ‘T’ shops (tobacco shops) in the side streets. Language being a big barrier I was fooling around looking for the ‘T’ shop when an Italian lady came to our rescue. Attracted to my wife’s Pakistani dress she told us that her spouse was from Bangladesh and offered any possible help which we gratefully accepted. Her guidance was of extreme help and from then on we went around the metropolis with utmost ease.
Piazza Venezia, the main city square, and former dictator Mussolini’s official quarters were just fifteen minutes walk from the National street. It was where Poet of the East Allama Iqbal had met the then strongman on his European tour. There were three concrete maps drawn on a wall near this imposing building and they showed the expanse of the Roman Empire in three different eras. It looked as if half of the world, at one point, was under the Roman rule. What a glorious past? Coliseum, the largest amphitheatre in Europe which could accommodate around 50000 spectators, was close by and a monument to see. Trevi fountain, frequented by the tourists in colossal numbers, is a place where one could wish, by throwing a coin into the water, for anything, except the proverbial free ride horses (for the beggars to ride). There were a large number of coins shining in the water on the floor of the fountain, each showing somebody’s secret wish. Following the tradition we too wished for the moon and got rid of some coins in the process.
Walking on a footpath one fine morning in the city centre we heard police cars with screeching tires and blowing sirens and assumed that some film shooting was going on. It was only the following day we came to know that some outlaws were being chased by the law enforcing agencies and a German tourist was killed in the cross fire. It was really hard to digest that such things could happen in a European capital in broad day light.
Vatican City, the smallest sovereign state in the world spread over an area of 44 hectare (108.7 acres), is a walled enclave in the city of Rome. It houses St. Peter’s church and Papacy. Created in 1929 the papal city state has its own postal services, a heliport, radio station and a publishing house. It issues its own coins though, like in Italy, Euro has replaced the age old Lira. Its population is just over 800 persons but millions of visitors throng the place every year. Vatican has the highest per capita crime rate in the world including purse snatching and pick -pocketing. At the church entrance it was interesting to see a notice reading; ‘Please cover your legs and heads before entering’. Such rules always sanctify the place.
Pisa was our next destination. We undertook a four hour long train journey to the city of the famous tower through the picturesque landscape with the Mediterranean Sea on one side and vast fruit orchards on the other. Large motor car carriers were seen plying in large numbers on the express way with locally manufactured cars loaded on them in tiers. We took a bus from the railway station to the leaning marble structure which is a free standing bell tower of the cathedral of the city of Pisa that would have collapsed long ago had it not been for the support of the millions of visitors who get themselves photographed with the tower as if they were preventing it from crumbling to the ground. We too did our bit towards supporting the sinking monument and took photographs as a testimony. I once saw a cartoon in the famous Punch magazine which showed the under construction (then vertical) tower of Pisa with scaffoldings all around and the architect telling his colleague: “There is a small defect in the foundation but rest assured nobody is ever going to notice it”. Fifty-six meters high, this 12th century building leans at an angle of just 5.5 degrees but at the top it measures 4.5 m from where it used to stand vertically.
Historically Galileo did his experiments by dropping two cannon balls from the top of the leaning tower to augment his theory of speed vs. mass, the Nazis used it as an observation post during WW II and Mussolini ordered it to be returned to its normal vertical position albeit without success. In 1964 the Italian government decided to keep the tilt for the promotion of tourism and kept it closed for the visitors for almost a decade to reinforce its foundations from sinking further. The heavy bells, seven in number, were removed to shed the extra load and it was declared stable for another 300 years.
The vehicular traffic in Pisa was somewhat more disciplined than that of Rome. An article in the Readers Digest titled ‘Driving Italian style’ eulogized that driving reflected the character of a nation and the painting supporting the article was no different than the one we see every day in our motherland except that the vehicles on the roads in Rome were cent per cent mechanized, unlike Pakistan where stone age animal driven carts are still plying side by side with the modern automotives. The city fathers in Rome are trying to device ways to overcome the traffic congestion and parking problems by disallowing the unauthorized traffic from the central part of the city during work days from 6 am to 6 p.m. We in Pakistan too will have to think of sorting this problem out sooner than later.
Latin, the original language of the Empire, was changed to Italian in the middle ages. Italian is a confluence of various regional dialects and in that respect has some theoretical semblance with Urdu, which itself is a conglomerate of different expressions. The Islamic community has grown significantly since the ‘not very distant’ past due to immigration from North Africa and the Middle Eastern countries and Rome can boast of the largest mosque in Europe built in 1995. We also came across Arab vendors selling their merchandize, especially semi precious stones, on the foot paths in Rome. The string of these multi coloured gems lent further hue to the already colourful side walks.
Our memorable trip to the historic city came to a close and we boarded Alitalia for Orly international Airport, Paris.

Rome is the place where you need to get lost! The city that’s full of surprises, history, charm, and colors. Put away your map, and roam around the historic center of Rome to discover beauties, that you couldn’t imagine! That’s the only way to really experience the eternal city, and the beautiful streets to see in Rome!
Even if you’ve been in Rome, you’ve never actually seen Rome if you didn’t get lost on those colorful cobbled streets. That’s a fact! After 9 visits, I can tell you, that I still didn’t see it all! And believe me, I’ve spent way too many hours roaming around already! Let’s see now some highlights!
Via della Reginella & Via dei Pastini
Those incredible little streets are one of the many reasons I love the Italian capital so much! It’s all about experiencing, breathing it in, enjoying it. Rome is not the place where you should be running with a tourist bus around. Rome is the city that you have to experience, to feel!
As simple as that. This is also the reason why each blogger and travel expert is suggesting to WALK when you’re visiting Rome! There’s so much more than the main landmarks, so much more hidden beauty!
This is very common in many big cities… to not have the opportunity for any memorable street experience. But Rome, Rome has the most beautiful streets to wander around for as many hours as you can!
If you’re a frequent visitor on my blog or my Instagram, you may already know that I have an obsession with colorful streets… Well, that obsession started in 2015 here, in the Eternal city!
Via del Governo Vecchio is the street where I spend most of my time when I’m in Rome. I discovered it back in 2015, and ever since that, this is my favorite street in Rome! Via del Governo Vecchio runs from Piazza Navona almost to the Castel San Angelo, parallel with the main street of Corso Vittorio Emmanuele II.
My favorite bar, the Bistro and Wine Bar Pasquino, and one of my fav restaurants, the Ristorante Pasquino is located on this street. They are both steps away from Piazza Navona. Also, one of the best gelaterias (ice cream shops) called Ice cRome is located right opposite these restaurants. Besides the charm, that really Italian narrow, cobbled street vibe, the buildings are beautiful as well!
Via del Governo Vecchio also offers a variety of bars, restaurants, shops, more gelaterias, art galleries, and antiquity stores all along the way! There’s no way to not find something you like on this street!
Find details about this area, Piazza Navona and it’s a neighborhood in my previous article: BEST NEIGHBOURHOODS IN ROME: NAVONA
Each big city has its fashion street where you can find all the famous luxury brands. In Rome, this street is called Via dei Condotti. A street linking Via del Corso with Piazza di Spagna, where you can find the famous Spanish Steps.
If you’re heading from Via del Corso through Via dei Condotti, you’ll gain an amazing view of the Spanish Steps and the church of Trinita dei Monti. So even if you’re not interested in shopping, or admiring the shopfronts, this view is worth a walk through Via dei Condotti!
Via Condotti features all the famous Italian brands like Armani, BVLGARI, Versace, and Prada. Though, you will find others like Chanel, Luis Vuitton, Swarowski, or Cartier to. When I’ve first walked down this street I was still at university. That day I’ve promised myself, that if once I’ll buy a luxury item, I will do it on this street! Still preparing for that…
Via del Moro & Via della Pelliccia
Trastevere is my second favorite neighborhood in Rome after the Navona neighborhood! It is located south of the Vatican city, near the Tevere river. One of those things I love the most in this area is the streets. Colorful, cozy, vibrant, and VERY ITALIAN. You’re bumping into traditional bars and restaurants on every step, literally! Colorful buildings, the flowers, the cobblestone roads… it’s just enchanting and fascinating.
Vicolo Moroni
In the past two years, I’ve been always booking my hostels/hotels/b&bs in Trastevere. One of my favorite places, while I was traveling alone, was the Orsa Maggiore Hostel for Woman Only. There’s nothing better than going out in the morning for a cappuccino and having it in such a beautiful atmosphere!
Trastevere is a bit outside the center of the city, which explains why is still much more traditional, and Roman, than other sides of the historic center. For a real Italian experience in Rome, definitely try to stroll around the streets of Trastevere!
Via Margutta runs between Piazza di Spagna and Piazza del Popolo. It’s a more hidden street, but with Google Maps you’ll find it easily. Originally, Via Margutta was home to various stables and workshops. It changed its face in the 20th century though!
It became famous after the premiere of the Roman Holiday movie. As you may know, Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) in the movie was living on this street of Rome, on Via Margutta. Thanks to the success of the Roman Holiday movie, many famous people moved here afterward.
This is how the neighborhood slowly became an exclusive, really expensive neighborhood in Rome. Today Via Margutta is hosting numerous art galleries, luxury shops, and restaurants. The neighborhood is still the residence of a wealthier layer of Romans.
This street goes parallel with the Tevere river in the historic center of Rome. It’s really close to Piazza Navona, Corso Vittorio Emmanuele II, and Campo di Fiori. Via Giulia was one of the first projects of Renaissance Rome. The street was designed by Bramante, who at the same time was working on the St Peter’s Basilica.
The street links the Ponte Sisto Bridge with the San Giovanni di Fiorentini church. Back in the 16th century, it was Rome’s most fashionable street, where merchants and bankers lived. It’s still considered a really elegant side of Rome, though it looks like it’s not as popular as a couple of years ago. Via Giulia, the past decades was really popular for its antiquities and fashion boutiques, but today you won’t find many of these open.
However, this street of Rome is still considered significant because of the amazing renaissance artist, Michelangelo! He had a plan to connect the Palazzo Farnese which can be found on this street, to the Farnese Villa in the Trastevere district. You can still see this arch leaning over Via Giulia on its southern end.
Vicolo del Malpasso & Vicolo della Scimia
Some of my favorite hidden streets are in the neighborhood of Campo di Fiori. As this side of the Corso Vittorio Emmanuele is not that overwhelmed with visitors, the streets are much nicer, calmer, charming. As I was staying mostly in the Trastevere neighborhood, the easiest way to get there was always through the cobbled streets. This is how I discovered both Vicolo del Malpasso and Vicolo della Scimia between many others!
Vicolo della Scimia got burned into my brain because I had to pass through it every single time I was going to or from the historic center of Rome. This one street couldn’t be replaced with another, and I was always freaking out on it. Don’t worry, it’s a safe street! Otherwise, I wouldn’t be suggesting seeing it!
The reason I was freaking out, because I’m terribly afraid of rats, and Rome has a great population of them. On this vicolo, there’s no place to go right or left, and it has no doors. So you get on it on one side of the palazzo block and you get out on the other side. So I was always stressed out, that what if a huge rat will walk against me?!? Where I’m going to run? What if one walks onto the street from one side and the other from the other side? I can’t escape!!! Of course, that never happened, but when someone’s this terrified, our brain can play with us a lot.
So, don’t worry, just put away your map, and head on to explore the streets of Rome. Discover the magic, find the hidden gems, and just breathe the atmosphere in. Rome has unbelievable magic, that you need to experience yourself!

“You packed what for Rome in March?”
That was the customs officer, eyeing my linen jumpsuit and flip-flops as if I’d just stepped off a cruise ship in the Arctic. To be fair, I thought March in Italy meant early spring. Blossom-scented breezes. Aperol spritzes under the sun. The Colosseum is adorned with charming gowns.
Instead, I stepped into what felt like a chilly Roman version of Seattle. The wind whipped through my bones. Locals wrapped themselves in puffer jackets and scarves. And there I was, dragging my tiny carry-on and an overinflated ego through cobblestone streets in socks that were basically social distancing from warmth.
Let me save you the frostbite. Here’s what I wish someone had told me before that first trip.
Italy in March sounds like a dream: off-season travel, fewer crowds, blooming landscapes, cheaper everything. And yes, that part is true.
But what your dreamy Pinterest boards don’t tell you? March in Italy is moody. One moment you find yourself soaking up the golden sunlight on the Spanish Steps, and the next, you find yourself sprinting through an unexpected downpour. The weather changes its mind more often…

I have said this many times before and will say it again- Rome is my favorite city in the world. Why? Because it’s the perfect blend of history and the modern world. It has it all- beautiful historical sites, amazing shops and of course; the perfect pizzas ever.
So here’s my experience of Rome and why it’s soo awesome:
Italian hospitality is unbeatable. The Italians treat you like long lost buddies right from the moment you first meet. The hotel staff are extra nice and attend to your complaints within seconds. But the best about Italians is the way they speak. Their language comes out like a sweet song. It so adorbs that I wouldn’t be able to guess even if they were swearing at me.
If you think you have eaten the best Italian food ever in your own countries, you’re gravely mistaken my friend. The best Italian food comes from the source…which would be Italy in this case (well obviously). These Italian restaurants/cafe’s serve the most scrumptious ravioli, epic mouth-watering risottos and pizzas to die for. I would make a trip back to Rome simply for the food if I could.
Rome’s history is divided into two parts. The Roman Empire and Medieval history. The architecture of each era is spread out into two distinct areas. The walk to the Colosseum is one of the most enchanting walks I have ever taken. There are ancient relics on either side of the pathway adding to the charm. The Medieval historical sites give off a very “Game of Thrones” vibe.
This mini-city on its own would make a trip to Rome worth-it. The Vatican some of the most beautiful frescos ever in the Sistine Chapel. You will find hundreds of tour guides right outside the Vatican who will give you a tour of the church and museum. Just make sure that you don’t get ripped off!
Milan is technically a major fashion capital but Rome isn’t far behind. The shopping here is marvelous from boutique brands to mainstream brands. There’s a Zara store that’s four stories high (I spent around two hours there I think). After a day of hard-core shopping you can relax in a nice spot, having street-made square pizzas and watch the sun setting over the beautiful historical ruins. Bliss!
Fun Fact: The Trevi Fountain– a must see site- has magical powers. Apparently whoever puts a coin in there is sure to come back to Rome one day. My mom put the coin twice and has visited Rome twice ever since. I put it as well and I sure do hope to go again someday!

Disclaimer: This is just a travel report. I won’t go into depth about statistics and politics.
As a French-born person. The rivalry between Italy and France has always been present in my mind.
Especially in 2006 when the Italians stole the Football World Cup (according to the French people at least).
And throughout education and media, a feeling of superiority is disseminated to the French nation:
Always look up to the Germans. Always look down on the Italians.
The Italians are also often called “Ritals”
Paris feels less safe. For instance, there are people at the airport trying to grab your suitcase and put it in their taxis so you feel obliged (threatened?) to use their services. I’ve lived this experience in Paris. But not in Rome.
The Roman transportation system and airports are less stressful. Speakers do not blast reminders every 30 seconds about pickpockets, C0vid rules, baggage security rules, etc. It is much more relaxing.

“All roads lead to Rome” — Romans have built one of the most sophisticated road networks, and all of them ended in the heart of the Empire — the City of Rome. I’ve cheated and took a plane, but eventually made it to one of the most interesting cities in the world.
“All roads lead to Rome” — you’ve heard this expression before. Maybe in the history class, maybe in the tourist guide. It comes from Roman Empire times. Back then, they built one of the most sophisticated road networks, and all of the roads led to the heart of the Empire — the City of Rome. I’ve cheated and took a plane, but eventually made it to one of the most interesting cities in the world.
There are two main reasons why you want to visit Rome: history and food. Guilty as charged, I have a soft spot in my heart for both of them. Growing up I have read numerous books on the history of Ancient Rome and have always been drawn to it. Romans made a huge contribution to our everyday lives: their political, economic, cultural and social norms had set the precedence for quite a lot of ways in which our modern society works. Food is amazing and available pretty much everywhere.
Also moving forward I will start to feature some music from the country I’ve visited to set your mood while you are reading the blog. The first are italo disco heroes Marvin & Guy.
When you start planning your trip, keep in mind that you will be walking a lot. Most attractions and sights are fairly close to each other and easily accessible by foot. Although Rome has public transportation and taxis/ridesharing services, I would recommend staying in central areas and just walk around. There is nothing like getting lost in the small ancient cobblestone streets of Rome… well, as long as you have comfortable shoes ;)
With that in mind I’ve ended up choosing the hotel in the Prati neighborhood, which is located halfway between the Vatican and Historic Center. I didn’t want to be in the midst of touristy areas but still appreciated an easy access to all sights. It worked out perfectly. I would also recommend Trastevere for good nightlife. Otherwise, most areas in Historic Center will provide you with numerous accommodation options. The only exception is the area around Termini — city’s main train and bus station, it seems to have a bad reputation.
Rome has 2 international airports but you most likely will arrive at Fiumicino Airport (FCO). It is the largest airport in Rome and Italy. Technically its official name is Aeroporto Leonardo da Vinci. From there you can take an express train or bus to Termini station, the ride will take you about 30–40 mins. I’ve chosen to take a bus because it had a stop near Vatican about 5 mins away from my hotel. I was advised against taking a taxi from the airport since they tend to overcharge tourists regardless of the mandated fixed fee. Unfortunately, you can’t order Uber from airport. In general Uber allowed in the city but only for premium cars/vans. If you want a regular UberX/Lyft experience, download MyTaxi app.
Start your trip from Colosseum. It is an amphitheater built in Ancient Rome times, which used to hold 50,000 spectators. Throughout times it was modernized, rebuilt and upgraded, all the while remaining a world-famous landmark. It hosted gladiator fights, animal hunts, mock sea battles, and executions. Colosseum is the symbol of Imperial Rome and one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.
Because of its popularity, it’s a major tourist trap. If walking around as a part of the crowd where everybody is trying to take a picture of every stone is not your thing, play smart. Rule #1: buy the ticket in advance here, the same ticket will get you to the Colosseum, Forum and Palatine Hill — all while avoiding the ticket line. Rule#2: get there super early and ideally on the workday, drink espresso in the morning (we’ll come back to that) and head over right away. You goal is to be done with all of this by early afternoon and switch to drinking Aperol Spritz somewhere.
Roman Forum is the plaza in the center of Rome next to Colosseum and Palatine Hill. Back in the days it was a center of Roman life, and now surrounded by the ruins of the several ancient government buildings. But even ruins give you an idea of the majestic importance and the spirit of the place.
Palatine Hill is one of the oldest parts of the city and the original location of imperial palaces. You can walk around the territory and learn about ancient buildings. Now remember my previous point of getting there earlier. Well, we didn’t. For some reason we’ve decided to grab lunch after Colosseum and do the rest after. Rookie mistake. Don’t be like us. That Aperol Spritz not going to drink itself.
Actually, let’s talk about Aperol, Campari and all other good stuff. Italians have a strong culture of aperitifs — drinks served before the meal. Aperol is an orange liquor, and Campari is a blood orange liqueur. Both are very popular aperitifs and bases for popular aperitif cocktails: Aperol Spritz (Aperol+Prosecco+club soda) and Americano (Campari+sweet vermouth+club soda) respectively. Needless to say, there’s nothing better than sipping one (or more) of them on a warm sunny day while enjoying the view after some touristy activities. Mark my words. You’re welcome.
Finish the walk at Piazza Venezia — the home of Vittorio Emanuele II Monument. It is a monument built in honor of the first king of unified Italy in 1919. It is one of the most amazing Roman buildings and just a colossal piece of architecture, which simply hypnotizes you. That’s probably one of the reasons Mussolini used it as a place for the military parades and public speeches.
It is the second day and you’re a bit tired from walking yesterday (or drinking last night), so you need a little pick me up. Now let’s pause here for a second. Coffee is somewhat a religion in Italy, and they take it seriously. There are also some rules, which you might consider even weird, but it’s their country and their rules. Rule #1: cappuccino (and other milk espresso-based drinks) or espressos with some pastry (croissant) in the mornings, only espressos in the afternoons. Rule #2: you order coffee at the bar and drink it quickly while standing. There is also the specific way to order it: you pay first, then take your receipt to the barista, who then will make it for you. Now you’re not the first foreigner who visited Italy, and most likely you will be near the major touristy area. So, nobody will really care, if you sit down in the afternoon with a cup of latte. But it’s generally a good idea to be aware of the local customs, so you don’t look like a complete idiot in their eyes.
Once you’re energized and ready to do, start from Piazza Navona. It a famous square of three fountains: Fontana del Moro, Fountain of Neptune and Fountain of Four Rivers. You would probably recognize them from various movies or famous photos.
Your next stop is The Pantheon. It’s a former Roman temple turned to church. It’s one of the best preserved Ancient Roman buildings because of its extensive use over the years. Interesting fact: its ceiling is done in the form of a dome, and till this day its world’s largest unreinforced concrete dome, and of course there are rumors of gods helping out there.
The Trevi Fountain is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and another world-famous piece of architecture. Rumor has it, you have to drink a glass of water out of it in order to come back to Rome. Today you’ll have to put some work in to get to it through the crowd of tourists. If you do so, there’s a pretty good chance that you’ll come back.
The Spanish Steps is another iconic sight, which was originally built to connect Spanish embassy with the church on top of the hill. By then you are probably a little tired and want to sit down, relax and eat gelato. Steps sound like a perfect place to do it. Wrong. The majority of the people sitting on the steps are tourists. Italians are not huge fans of sitting on the historical monument. Recently they’ve passed a law that allows police to give out tickets up to 400 euros to ppl sitting there. It might be a very expensive gelato after all. If you’re still full of energy you can walk up to Villa Borghese Gardens, which is a public park on top of the hill.
Vatican is an independent city-state within Rome borders. It’s the smallest sovereign state in the world by area and population, and primarily exists under the governance of the Catholic Church. Again, follow the rule: sightseeing in the morning, relaxing in the afternoon. Beat the crowds by arriving earlier. Vatican’s main sights are St. Peter’s Basilica, the Sistine Chapel and Vatican Museums.
St. Peter’s Basilica is the largest church in the world and one of the holiest Catholic shrines. The entrance is free, but if you want to go up to its top and enjoy the amazing view, you’ll have to join the separate dome line and pay the fee. The Sistine Chapel is the official residence of Pope in Vatican City. The Vatican Museums are Christian art museums, which display works collected by popes over the years.
From Vatican walk to Castel Sant’Angelo. It’s cylindrical building on the right bank of the Tiber. It was originally built as a mausoleum and later used as a fortress or castle. Inside there’s a museum and you can also go to its roof and grab a bite while enjoying the view.
While doing all of the discussed sightseeing, you should not forget the second reason why you are in Rome: food. You will see it everywhere. The rule of thumb: if you see a lot of tourist crowds, do not buy food there. Walk a couple of blocks, look where locals eat. Also embrace carbs, carbs, carbs.
Several dishes you should absolutely try in Rome:
Generally, I would recommend to explore Trastevere neighborhood, which is famous for its nightlife: restaurants and bars.
Ciao!

Mille viae ducunt homines per saecula Romam
(A thousand roads lead men forever to Rome)
– Proverb.
I have been reading and hearing much about population decline in the last months — except for Israel. India takes over from China as the largest population, since it is less urbanized. Homes are found empty in Japan for years now. Predictions are made for war and growth with a declining population. Schools are shut with no students. And there lies the prophecy of Universe 25.
For those of you who do not know, Universe 25 is the 25th iteration of a behavioural study on rodents. The premise was simples: you have some rats in a utopia designed to feed and house then to perfection, no luxury spared. Having reached 2200 mice, the population founds its way to decline in less than 2 years, and it eventually completely died out.
For those who observe the unprecedented prosperity humanity has reached, Universe 25 may seem like a Morgana’s prophecy: “he is your destiny, and he is your doom”. Thankfully, we are far more complex than mice, we are not confined in an experimental setting (unless you count the planet as confined, while we do not even know the whole of it yet) and we have a knack for developing — our not-so-utopia was not handed down to us by some ET.
I would submit we have far too many differences, and though we may share in a certain decline, the history of humanity is lined with ascent and descent: empires, tribes, families, armies and much more. And as I could not keep out of everything… this has everything to do with Ancient Rome. As a matter of fact, I continue to agree and expand on prof. Oliveira Martins’ quote (translated from Portuguese): “the history of the Roman Republic is the paradigm of all known histories”. Though I would say: the history of Ancient Roman is the known paradigm of all known histories. And in that I mean the empire, the republic, the kingdom, the city, the economy, the politics, the rivalries, and everything else.
And, in this too, Rome has already declined and mostly faded, buried under the sands of time; the city has suffered an unprecedented demographic collapse from the height of what could have been a hugely dense 1.5 million people metropolis[*] by the year 100 A.D. to a few tens of thousands by the start of the Middle Ages. Adding the Western Roman Empire’s downfall to external conquest and the Byzantine slow, thousand-year, decline: one can only say the answers also lie in Rome.
When we talk about the ancient city of Rome, it is difficult to know exactly what we are talking about. That is, the city changed so much from the kings to Odoacer that one would. Are we talking about the near-empty thatched huts before the Sabine women, are we talking about unprecedented marvels of marble and stone from all over the Mediterranean or are we talking about the mythical decadent figure bestowed unto us by artists and thinkers from the Renascence onward?
Well, we are talking about all of that, of course, but we cannot properly talk about all of that at the same time, lest we lose chronological sense.
Keeping that in mind, let us be orderly and start at the beginning. Rome would not look like a booming metropolis at the time of the kings. It had not sprawled over the seven hills, it had no Egyptian grain to distribute, no treasures of the mysterious East and none of the major marks (the Flavian Theatre, the Thermæ, the temples built by the greatest generals and so on). We are talking about a civilisation that is, in sooth, yet to be — though now we know it indeed was.
We may consider that the challenge posed to the Roman Kingdom and most of the republican times was there. A mission existed, be it to overcome Carthage, to attain general success or to rule the Sea. What I mean is: there is no place here for a weak, young society to ever act like a decadent empire. The opposite, in fact. There lies no path to power in imitating power. Brazil is an example of such a failure in our times: a country that looks up to “Scandinavian socialism”[†] and seeks to spend just like Sweden, while providing zero of the ambiance that gave way to Swedish prosperity — and we are not talking about an empire here. Needless to say, Brazil is not in the highway to prosperity, but threading the dangerous road to serfdom.
At any point, the fact is Rome stood far from the spoiling utopia of Universe 25 at this moment of its history.
After the fall of Carthage, we might say Rome has become the leading empire of its time, and of all time, we might add. That is, taking on the mantle of the cosmopolis, Rome is the universal empire that weaves the very legitimacy of the concept. And it did enjoy its time in the Sun, much like the USA after World War Two. Using the population of the actual city of Rome as a proxy, we must note that the population seems to have peaked by the end of the first century A.D., according to some estimations.
The precise movements of Roman prosperity are yet not detailed to be discussed, and are also not the main point of this essay, so here comes the question: what happened after that? Well, my readings indicate that the population fell just as quickly as it grew. It is important to observe that this was not a childless society. Romans died from plague and war; they moved back to the rural areas as Rome was politically and economically voided — and it would be possible that those who remained had less children, but who knows.
The point is: the urban population fell, and by the end of Antiquity, many estimates agree that it would not have even a hundred thousand people — and that it would continue to dim well into Medieval Times. We are talking here about a much more dangerous city, abandoned by the imperial structure, lacking a Senatorial class (or any such wealthy people who could turn anywhere they went into Monaco), partially abandoned and materially depreciating. This is no city of wonders, commerce, and opportunity. It is a hollow dream, voided by the decay and overextension of empire.
And for more than a thousand years, Rome would remain the seat of the papacy, de facto and de jure a Christian City (identified more by the Church than with the Byzantines over the Adriatic), mostly reduced to minor Italian squabbles, and depending on greater kingdoms to call upon its influence.
It is no mystery what the ancient Romans did: they fled to their farms. Large and small, senator or bum, the wandering search of safety, shelter and a life led the Romans to the countryside — and led properties to the hand of powerful men, who could defend the land/fiefs and the previous owners, now their servants or vassals. One might take note of the wording, but it is better to say it fully: feudalism had kicked down the door.
It is thus that some questions arise:
i. What was happening to population and fertility when feudalism began?
ii. Did moving away from Rome make less babies or more?
iii. How relevant was the barbarian influx?
iv. How and why did things change again?
One might observe that these are not trivial questions. To answer them accurately would require precise data from more than a thousand years ago, and we do not have that. In many ways, that may be a problem since the absence of this information makes way for all sort of fantasy storytelling, but let us propose some thoughts:
It is likely that fertility fell by the end of Antiquity, as that trend is observed for general times of crises, but it is unclear if that had any meaningful role to play in the social or economic setting. We know, as an example, that individual wealth grew at the time of the Black Death, since it led to concentration of inheritance and the scarcity of labour. It would be interesting to see how that would have worked out a thousand years prior. It is also not clear if there was a difference in urban and rural fertility, as there exists nowadays.
[*] 1.5 million people is the highest number found during my research on the topic, but I am not subscribing to that number, just using it as a reference for the scale of the collapse.
[†] It is unfortunately the case for Brazilian politics, that the Marxist/socialist left (allied to Maduro, Cuba, Ortega, …) conflates the Scandinavian political and economic setting with “socialism that works”, at the same time using the ludicrous claim that the USSR, Cambodia, and other such bloodthirsty regimes were not “real socialism” (at best, there are times when we can hear people defending gulags or saying they never existed in the first place). We should observe that such claims have been publicly refuted not only by simple facts, but also by Scandinavian leaders, but referring more commonly to claims made by American politicians: <https://www.vox.com/2015/10/31/9650030/denmark-prime-minister-bernie-sanders>

When I was a kid I watched a movie called “Roman Holiday”. The magnificent and enchanting scenery shown in the film evoked my longing for Rome.
Years later, I had the opportunity to visit the “Eternal City” (with more than 2500 years of history). It was 2003, and my husband and I decided to take a week-long vacation to Rome.
As with my other travel stories, here I will continue to talk about some of the little things I observed and experienced in Rome.
1. The airport bus couldn’t open its door and a ‘free’ subway ride
One afternoon in March, we took off from Düsseldorf, Germany, with our infant son, and arrived at Rome’s Fiumicino airport about two hours later.
March is the best season in Rome, the weather is neither cold nor hot. We came from still chilly Germany to warm Rome and felt comfortable. But soon we were overwhelmed by what happened next.
After waiting at the airport for a long time, the bus to the city finally arrived. Before we could react, the crowd swarmed and filled the bus in an instant.
Oddly, the middle door of the bus wouldn’t open, so our pram had to squeeze in through the narrow front door.

If you only have a few days in Rome, as I did, it’s important to see as much history and culture as possible. In our last post, we showed you our ideal day in the heart of Rome, Piazza Novona — the best espresso (according to Romans) , gelato, markets, and the Pantheon. In bite-size pieces, here’s our version of the best things to do in Rome in 48 hours.
I. Piazza della Repubblica: Piazza della Repubblica is a beautiful semi-circullar piazza with the Fountain of the Naiads in the center, and the Basilica of St. Mary of the Angels and Martyrs across from the fountain. I encourage you to look inside the Basilica, inside is a beautiful bronze meridian solar line, designed by Francesco Bianchini, with marble depictions of the zodiacs.
II. The Colosseum — because no trip to Roma is complete without visiting the Colosseum, the icon of Imperial Rome. Right next door to the Colosseum is the Roman Forum, the heart of ancient Rome. Both ruins are must see when visiting Rome, and you can purchase the Roma Pass, which gives free entry to both the Forum and the Colosseum.
III. The Spanish Steps (or the walk to the Spanish Steps): The Spanish Steps is a monumental set of 135 steps, made famous by the 1953 classic Roman Holiday, with Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck. The base of the steps can be overcrowded with tourists, so I suggest arriving north of the steps by Via Sistina and taking the time to visit the shops along the way, and admire the charming architecture of the streets of Rome.
IV. Villa Borghese: Villa Borghese is an extensive garden that was built in 1605 by Cardinal Borghese as a party villa. It has many villas built as summer residences for Popes and nobles, but is now most visited for the Galleria Borghese, which has sculptures by Bernini, and paintings by Raphael and Caravaggio. Buy tickets in advance because this is a popular museum, and aside from the Vatican, contains some of the best works in Rome. If you don’t make it to the museum, or want to spend an extra hour or so exploring the park, there is much to see, such as the Sienna Square, National Gallery of Modern Art, or the Temple of Aesculapius. My favorite part of the park was the view from the Villa Medici. which offers stunning panoramic views of Rome (above).
V. Vatican City: The Vatican can be made a half-day trip or a whole day excursion. There is so much art in the Vatican Museums, and because of the amount of tourists, I recommend allotting quite a few hours to see all the art the Vatican has to offer. There are four Sculpture Museums, a Painting Collection, a museum of Modern Religious Art, and a historical museum and art gallery. The Vatican’s extensive art collection started over 500 years ago with the purchase of Laocoon and his Sons, a marble sculpture found in a vineyard near the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome. The Sistine Chapel cannot be missed, I could spend hours looking up at the masterpiece of a ceiling, Michelangelo’s greatest work. The heart of the Vatican is St. Peter’s Basilica, one of the world’s largest churches, and the most renowned work of Renaissance architecture. Words cannot even describe the magnificence of St. Peter’s Basilica, and you must see Michelangelo’s Pieta located inside the Basilica.

When I travel, I like to seek out authentic local experiences. This time someone heard my prayers and decided to give me one of the most classic local southern European experiences ever on my first day — a public transportation strike. So I walked everywhere.
First impressions:The area around the train station was pretty gritty, there was graffiti on every vertical surface, litter all over the ground, and…sketchy people standing around. But this is pretty standard around big train stations everywhere in the world, Paris North Station is also similar, but Rome definitely outperforms Paris in terms of grittiness. Unlike the perfectly manicured buildings in Paris, Rome feels more “wild” and unrestrained.
Roman traffic deepened such an impression. Walking on a large boulevard, I reached a roundabout where many large roads met. In the middle of the road, there was a small police stop, with two middle-aged Italian policewomen directing traffic. They were doing a good job, but they were a little…unpredictable. Literally in the middle of a green light with cars pouring onto the intersection, one of them strolled confidently into the middle of the road, and held out her hand firmly to stop traffic. The cars stopped. They were not in straight lines. Some cars backed out of the intersection. Everything was still for a moment. And then the chaos reignited. I had no idea what was going on, and to be honest I was a little bemused, but I calmly crossed the street and kept walking. Traffic in Rome is quite a comedy. Not all major intersections have traffic lights or crosswalks, but that doesn’t stop people from darting across busy traffic; and even when there are traffic lights, that doesn’t stop cars and motorbikes from sneaking across. On paper, this sounds like Paris, but I assure you it’s different. Parisian drivers don’t open the windows to shout expressively at you with both hands gesturing wildly. Rome has a more comical disorganization, it’s like a Mr. Bean who knows what he’s doing. It’s hard to explain.
“Parla inglese?” It’s been a while since I’ve been in a country where I don’t speak the local language, and I’d forgotten how frustrating but also how amusing that can be. I’d pre-booked entrance tickets to the Coliseum, Forum, and Palantine Hill to avoid waiting in long lines. I’d read the fare conditions closely, and realized that I could get in for free with my Tufts in Paris “student of Art History” ID. Since mine was a discounted ticket, I had to go to the ticket office to verify my status before going in.
At the ticket office : (original conversation, imagine strong iTaLiAn accent) - Ticket lady: You reserved a free ticket, you need pay 12 euros for the adult ticket.- Me: (confused because I’d also reserved an audio guide for 7.5 euros, but in the moment I forgot what the 7.5 euros was for, and also forgot why I got a “free” ticket) I thought I paid 7.5 euros for a ticket, why are you saying it’s free?- Ticket lady: That is for the audio guide. For the entrance fee, you need to pay 12 euros because you are not an EU citizen. You need an ID or passport.- Me : (in my mind — how do you know I’m not an EU citizen??? and then I remembered why I got discounted tickets and started taking out my Tufts in Paris Art History ID) I’m a student — - Ticket lady: (interrupting) No student ticket, only adult 12 euros.- Me: But I study art history.- Ticket lady: Architecture?- Me: No, art history.- Ticket lady: Not architecture?- Me: No, art history!- Ticket lady: Ohhh ok, ~art history~ I see, sorry but only students of architecture and history of art can get free tickets.- Me: (ready to faint — art history and history of art are the same thing!)I didn’t want to argue with her anymore so I just pressed my ID against the glass.- Ticket lady: (sees my ID that says “l’histoire de l’art”) Oh ok! Then that’s good!
Good thing I insisted and didn’t cave in to paying 12 euros, otherwise I’d have lost many gelatos and that would be very sad :(
After an afternoon, I have the impression that Rome is a little less organized and less glamorous than Paris, but with more character and personality. It’s like Paris is an elegant, uptight lady, whereas Rome is a carefree singing guitarist with tattered clothes. But this is just day 1, maybe my impressions will change after 5 days! :)

Dramatic titles for me are an art form and today we are about to talk about something with no relation to any of the cities mentioned above but points to critical moments in all. Abstract titles are my way of art and ironically they a mosaics that my mind paints.
Rome was not built in a day; this a saying that has been repeated for a long time, and will also be passed to generations as long as humanity remains. It is true, Rome as an empire has been around Before Christ and After Christ hence, it is obvious that it was not a day’s job. I think it is more important to take the principles of Roman Construction and apply them in our lives.
The senior Pastor at Life Church said something in a sermon I watched, He said “When we are born we look like our Parents, when we die we look like our choices ”. That word struck me and I who enjoy a largely sedentary lifestyle imposed on me by the nature of my career went for a much-needed walk. I live in Ajah (an area in Lagos) and I have lived here for a while now (except when I was in Uni), I have seen development occur with time and how places that would have you scared now look like a jewel.
However it was not always so, I recalled and remembered what it used to be like when I walked towards a now abandoned house, an abandoned site, and a poorly maintained sand-filled road. When I began to see these buildings and roads, got the burden to paint them with words as it cuts across various niches.
Knowledge is the most pleasant and annoying thing to have, it is a double edge sword. Ardan Labs a software company that has a training arm has a saying, “If you think it’s expensive to hire a professional, just wait until you hire an amateur” and it is true about learning, “If you think it’s expensive to train to be a professional, try ignorance”. Like every good Lawyer, I will present facts that could be misconstrued but I hope I paint pictures that will live an impression on you.
Pompei is/was a city that existed in Italy under the Roman empire that got buried under ash from an Erupted volcano called Mount Vesuvius. They thrived as a City till a threat possibly called everyone who lived in that city.
Knowledge as a double edge sword had me asking how did people come to settle around an Active Volcano. Did they have no Geophysicist, no Geologist in ancient Rome that could inform people of the threat to life? Ignorance which was not an active choice of the people of Pompeii levelled and buried an entire city.
Atlantis is presented as a lost city buried somewhere in the ocean, although scientific inquiry has presented facts that Plato’s work which mentioned Atalantis in his work Timaeus and Critias was not a total representation of life but an allegory to drive home a point. As such science concludes that Atlantis never existed. Well, I am not debating science but Intend to accept for the basis of this at Atlantis did exist.
A beautiful city that got buried as a result of earthquakes, again if Atlantis really did exist why did its people decide to settle on an Island? If they had the foresight of the future would they have settled there? I would argue and present an engineer's answer “It depends”, however, the law of averages agrees that if they settled elsewhere and the earthquake happens again the island may sink or it would not, depending on its averages (in this case the intensity of the quake).
These two cities albeit one being a farce and the other did exist, are demonstrations of how knowledge gaps are our undoing. I looked at buildings that were the houses that tickled my need to be rich and a few of them looked like the have sunk. I remember coming to Dad’s house while it was constructed and its foundation was so high. My dad imagine the height of the road ( in the future ) which I felt was nearly insane. Looking at houses around that looked like they had sank and will still sink I began to understand that an intricate part of knowledge and building (not actual buildings) with it is the ability to preempt actions, develop more knowledge and respond accordingly. Today the height of the road is at least a level higher than my Dad anticipated. There are 5 new buildings around my Dad’s house and they seem taller because of the new ground level the foundation was laid, luckily for my Folks their house did not sink or sink as much, but this ability to preempt the future or an unforeseen circumstance struck me as a key to building.
Recently I switched my work codebase from an in-route logic-dependent application to a repository pattern which was initializing access to the Database (DB) in the Repositories, that was an excellent design for me at the time, the way the DB was accessed was flawless and I felt nothing could go wrong.
There has been a sprint-like approach my team had imbibed to produce the product that had been blueprinted (designed). In this fire brigade approach, I discovered that the access to the DB was a poor decision, my ignorance of this was glaring and staring me down and I had to come up with a solution. I spent 16 hours working across two days to come up with a solution that resolves the DB via the Framework’s method. I am sure it feels like I have lost you, apologies. Enough of Tech detailed talk layered with backend remarks. My ignorance meant that if this product went live based on my decision and knowledge at the time there was going to be an epic fail.
Luckily for me, I saved the day by experimenting and drawing fact-based solutions from a source of truth (FastAPI’s documentation), my teammates attested to an uptick in performance across my system. There is a word for if that situation above got to production and I have to manage the such situation and resolve it. It is called Technical debt. The lack of knowledge with regards to something intricate means that we would not deliver at the optimal mark in that regard.
A lot is happening across the world, the more we look the more we see that no one really has it all figured out, communities, countries, sports teams, people and automated processes. Knowledge is not a destination it is a continuous place. Knowledge is the refiner's fire, through its acquisition we realize how flawed our previous implementations are.
We do this by becoming like Rome.
Rome seems to be a wonder of the world, because, at some point in our lives, we hear Rome was not built in a day to persuade us to do the work. The idea however is to communicate to us the Kaizenic nature of Rome’s Architecture. There are Ancient structures that are still up today, such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and the Roman amphitheatre among a few which I know.
These structures are borne out of a place of improvement, the first structure architects would design would give them the cringe if they look at it after years of practice and work, this is why tech solutions are versioned, and this is why we have a Corolla 1998 and 2023 version. It is the Kaizenic nature of constant improvement, this motion is borne out of a place of constant reflection and a zest for the better.
This is why Veterans in any field are better than young blood, this is why the best coaches are people who actively did what they are coaching about (Albeit not at the grandest of stages).
The Roman buildings and the empire did not take over the whole world in one day, it was a gradual continuous action that became the empire. Some battles, some wars, some years of peace. History’s recounts are always fast and opaquely divulging to the perspective of time and timing. A good example as we ride out on the last strokes of this art, are football players.
A lot of these players dedicate their lives to this sport, childhood, teenage, and even their youth, why will Haland not be a deadly striker? Why will he also not lose a penalty, how come he could he can easily move on.
Time is an important perspective to everything including knowledge, I hated balancing chemical equations in secondary school but I loved it in the early years of Uni.
The most important thing these buildings have thought me is if we are not dead yet then we can become better, your next project should be better than the previous one, that is the only way to show growth and become Rome.
When we are born we are like our parents, but in death, we are our choices. I live you with a wise word on life, we will always have regrets in life, these are an opportunity cost of opportunities forgone. The rule is to remember regret is a feature of life, not a Bug.
Till next time.

Before I begin, I would like you to know how why I am sharing this information with you, since each author has their purpose and I am sure that you are curious about mine. Why should you believe me, an American girl still in high school? For starters, I am not tied to any organization and I am not trying to sell you anything. I am not only writing this to make your trip planning easier, but I am also writing this for myself. I have also added my own personal experience to guide you. I hope that while recording my own memories, I can aid you in planning your trip to Rome so you can have the best experience.
Most people visit Rome in the summer months when the blazing sun illuminates the historical center. My family (of four) decided to avoid the crowds and fly to the city in late December. I was tasked with the most time-consuming but also the most important job: creating the itinerary. My job consisted of booking reservations for the famed Colosseum and Vatican Museums, finding small gelato shops and fancy restaurants, and locating more authentic Italian respites.
The biggest downside was that there wasn’t much information about what Rome was like in the winter so we didn’t know what clothes to pack. According to the weather predictors, the sun set around 5:45 pm which was very early. Also, the temperature ranged from 35°F to 60°F. We weren’t sure about how to dress; should we wear t-shirts? Coats? We honestly had to improvise, so we packed a bit of everything.
Now, when I was trying to plan the trip out, I did not have such a wealth of information in one place. Even more annoying, many of the websites I found were advertising tickets much more expensive than the actual ones. I spent many hours on TripAdvisor, browsing through the many forums. It was difficult to find truly unbiased information. In total, I spent many hours on hundreds of websites trying to figure out how to best visit Rome and what to know about customs in Italy. Of course, there wasn’t information about everything, so we ended up learning a lot of lessons from our unexpected encounters.
I also had a tough time with scheduling. While researching, I discovered that Italy was a lot different compared to the suburbs where I reside. It takes about an hour to walk from one end to the other. This posed a problem for me while I was planning; I wasn’t really used to city life, so I didn’t have a good sense of how long it would take to walk certain distances. I also had no ideas as to how long we would spend at each site. Would we spined at the Spanish Steps? Five minutes? One hour? What about the Pantheon? Maybe we would have extra time. Maybe we would be rushing everywhere. We really just had to wait and see. Now I know you’re curious to see how the trip turned out.
Overall, Rome was a great experience for me. I got to see the historical sites outside of textbooks and class and I was taken back by how huge everything is. You really won’t be able to appreciate the genius of the ancient Romans and the Renaissance artists until you get to observe the great works with your own eyes. Since we visited in December, we got to enjoy the Christmas lights and trees set up all across the city. And of course, the pasta, pizza, and gelato were all very delicious. There was a lot of variety at restaurants and cafes so I got to try things that were very atypical of my American lifestyle (Nutella pizza or fried zucchini flowers).
Now onto the specifics (click here to see a shortened version):
Here’s what I would advise: pack layers. We didn’t realize that most of the time we would be out when it was cold, so we didn’t pack very well. Only my mom did, so I had to borrow some of her clothes. It is really cold in the morning up to about 10 am and after sunset around 6 pm. Here’s what kept me warm:
This guide should have covered extensively all the little things you know about visiting Rome. Should you have any more questions, do let me know. Otherwise, I do hope this helped and safe travels!

From Bari I headed across Italy to Pompeii and an overnight stop in the Bay of Naples.
There’s not much that can be said — at least, not much that’s profound — about Pompeii that hasn’t been said, better, a dozen times before.
It’s been a world-famous tourist destination for literally centuries — an unmissable stop on the original Grand Tours.
So my main observations are pretty unoriginal.
My first: it’s big — really big. I trudged around for five hours and didn’t see it all.
As is always the case in places like this, the choking crowds of tourists quickly thinned out, observing the inverse square law of laziness.
My other unoriginal observation is that it’s amazingly well preserved. It’s not in obviously worse nick than the 30-year-old ruins we had seen in Mostar a few weeks earlier.
In a neat parallel to the low-value service industry focus of today’s Pompeii — surrounded by snack bars, restaurants and hotels — the ancient ruins of Pompeii show that not that much was different two millennia ago.
The economy of Roman Pompeii revolved, clearly, around having a good time.
Leisure centres — sorry, Roman baths. Sports centres — sorry, amphitheatres. Takeaways — sorry, thermopolia. Really, the tourist industry of southern Italy hasn’t changed that much in two millennia. The ancient ruined versions don’t even look that different from their modern counterparts.
After an overnight stop in Torre del Greco — in a charming farm with half-arsed service and unannounced restaurant closure — the car, which had been complaining of some unspecified lurgy since Albania (through the medium of beeps and a flashing orange spanner icon), finally decided that it was oil that it wanted.
The car had been bonked pretty hard on the underside in the rock-strewn ploughed field that passed for a car park at Bogove waterfall near Berat a few days earlier. Had I punctured the oil pan?
To make matters worse, I’d told a local tweenager trying to shake me down for a couple of lek to ‘watch my car’ to get lost. Had he sabotaged the car in revenge?
Was the car slowly bleeding out? Was it leaving a puddle of motor oil at every stop?
Was the motor, pistons unlubricated, grinding itself down into iron filings with every mile driven?
Being prone to anxiety, this is not the sort of thing I am particularly good at remaining relaxed about.
The anxiety was not improved by noticing liquid dripping from the underside of the car while waiting outside the gates of the guest house (the manager taking his sweet time — more than half an hour — to actually come and let me in).
Leaving a tarpaulin under the car overnight calmed nerves somewhat when it emerged the next morning without any oil stains at all. The dripping was… water from having cleaned the windscreen.
And, using a dipstick for the first time since my driving test, I concluded the oil level in the engine was just about tolerable — admittedly when parked on a slope.
My mind put slightly, if not entirely, at ease, I powered north towards Rome, where, after some not-entirely-enjoyable traffic, and quite possibly some low traffic neighbourhood-related traffic infractions, I parked the car underground for a few days.
I’ve been asked a ton of times why I can speak Italian. The answer I usually give — my dad’s a retired Italian literature professor and I grew up hearing it — isn’t really true, or at least, it’s far from a full explanation.
It’s not like hearing grown men talking about Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio is a great draw for a kid.
And I hardly ever went to Italy in childhood either — aside from two trips to Veneto, summer holidays were always in France.
It’s when I was a student that I became obsessed with Italy.
Over a couple of summer trips, I came to love all the ways in which it’s the best country in the world by a country mile. Nowhere else packs in as much good food, history, architecture and culture.
I came to love, too, all the other ways in which Italy powers through its manifest dysfunctions, shaking off flaws that would condemn lesser countries to failure and obscurity. I even enjoy — no, enjoy isn’t quite the right word, am entertained by — Italian politics.
And so, at a loose end the summer after graduating, having failed to line up a job (worse was to come when I lined up one I hated), I signed up for introductory Italian classes.
My ear trained by hearing the tedious Dante talk, my interest piqued by summer trips, and with the headstart that comes from French grammar and vocabulary, I found Italian ridiculously easy to learn.
After a couple of terms and fairly minimal effort, I was speaking far better Italian than I ever did German, despite six years’ hard slog through school.
I’ve been to Italy most years ever since.
Which makes it all the more odd that this was actualy my first trip to Rome.
It didn’t disappoint.
Not just because St Peter’s is every bit as extraordinary as its reputation. It feels corny to say, but it’s a genuinely awe-inspiring and — whisper it — spiritual place.
Not just because the ancient sites — the Forum, the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo — are so impressive.
Not even because the Pantheon is even more astonishing than I expected, and the architectural highlight of the entire trip.
In addition to that, it’s also everything I usually like about Italy — from the great food, to the nice atmosphere, to the walkable cityscape.
It’s also got the distinctive typography on its shop signs that you see everywhere in Italy and nowhere outside it.
(It’s also while in Rome that I got the good news about a funding bid I’d written just before heading off. This prompted an ill-advised but enjoyable number of Campari spritzes on a very nice café terrace in Trastevere, and a well-earned headache the next morning.)
After resting the ailing car for a few days, I made a detour to a Peugeot garage in the suburbs for the oil it was demanding, then headed north.

New theories about a mystery hundreds of years old and a secret known to few Romans that was not meant to be revealed
It was 8 a.C. when the famous poet Ovid fell out of favor with the Emperor Augustus, who exiled him, without the confiscation of his goods, to Tomis (now Costance), a small port on the Black Sea.
But what was the cause of this great punishment for such a famous and important character for Rome?
Let’s try to give an answer to this question, taking into account the new theories.
Publio Ovidio Nasone was one of the most important Roman poets, one of the main exponents of Latin literature and, above all, of the elegiac poetry.
- Elegiac Poetry: lyrical composition united by specific metric form and by arguments that were opposed to the epic with a subjective and autobiographical setting, interpreted as a lament.
Ovid was the author of many works and his fame was as great during his lifetime as afterwards: his style and his themes were taken up by Dante, Petrarca, Shakespeare and many other.
His most famous work is “The Metamorphoses” whose the best known story is Apollo and Daphne’s myth.
So, what was the reason for his RELEGATIO (exile)? It still is a mystery today as the clues we have come almost exclusively from Ovid himself: what we know for sure is that the poet was exiled by the Emperor Augustus, but his successor, the Emperor Tiberius, maintained the punishment.
The fame of Ovid, as mentioned, during his life was very great and therefore the reason behind his exile must have been very serious.
Let’s see here what his “error” may have it been, according to the scholars, ‘till recent times.
- An illecit relationship with Giulia Maggiore, the daughter of the Emperor Augustus, of which he sang in the “Amores”, under the pseudonym of “Corinna”
- Perhaps he favored the relationship between Giulia Minore, granddaughter of Augustus and daughter of Giulia Maggiore, and Senator Decimo Giunio Silanus, causing them to commit the crime of adultery
- He discovered illecit dealings of Emperor Augustus at his court
- He snooped about the private conducts of Livia Drusilla, wife of Augustus
- He partecipated in a conspiracy against Tiberius
It was precisely in the year of the exile that Ovid had achieved his maximus success thanks to “The Metamorphoses”, his masterpiece, in which he recounts the transformation of the protagonists into plants, animals or objects.
Ovid was considered a libertine and wasn’t well seen by the Augustan political side, very traditionalist and conservative, because he used to criticized the two fundamental pillars of the Roman society: Religion and Family.
But it was not this that caused the exile, but something that as a punishment had the “capital punishment” which, however, Emperor Augustus commuted into exile (as Ovid himself tells us).
But it really was one of the aforementioned actions that condemned Ovid? What about the “carmina”?
As mentioned before, the reason we have listed ahve been proposed by scholars until recently, almost forgetting the “carmina” implied and the fact that this could be connected to the “error” and not be a separate thing.
At the time of his exile, Ovid was writing the “Fasti”, an epic poem aimed at revisiting Roman festivals and rites: there would have been 12 books, one for each month of the year.
Halfway through the work, the order for the RELEGATIO arrived and the work was interrupted, nver to be resumed again.
- A clue -
At the beginning of the fifth book, where the poet researches the etymological origins of the name of the month of May and at a certain point, Ovid has the Muse Calliope (the poetry’s muse) tell the backgrounds of Rome’s foundation and she speaks of the constellation of the Pleiades.
In Latin literature, the importance that Ovid gave to this constellation when speaking about Rome’s origin is unusual: no one before him had mentioned neither Maia nor teh Pleiades in this context.
Certainly Ovid would never have allowed himself to invent something extraneous to the tradition regarding the birth of Rome (neither did the non-romans writers or Rome’s enemies).
- Was, therefore, a forbidden subject that Ovid wrote about? -
We must now take a step back and tell talk about an event that took place about 100 years earlie: the story of Quinto Valerio Sorano who was senteced to death for revealing the secret name of Rome.
Servius and Plutarch too wrote of the sacrilege commited by Soranus, a tribune of the plebs, poet and grammarian of vast erudition, dear friend of Cicero, whose sentence was death by crucifixion.
A certain reason, that we know for sure, for which the Romans kept the real name of the Urbe (other latin name for Rome) hidden and secret is the EVOCATIO (evocation), a rite for which the patron god of a city was invoked, pronouncing its name, in front of its walls during a siege: knowing the name of the god was the equivalent to seizing the essence of the city and subduing it.
- The Pleiades -
The Pleiades are a cluster of stars located in the constellation of Taurus, 440 light years away from the Earth and includes about 3000 stars, but the eye can see only 6 to 12 of them.
These stars are mentioned by many ancient peoples and it is considered that they thought there were 7 of them. They are found depicted in the Nebra Disc, the oldest surviving depiction of the night sky, dating back to 1600 b.C. .
Also according to the Greeks, the Pleiades were 7: Daughters of Atlas and Pleirone (daughter of Tetis and Ocean) their names were “Alcione and Merope, Celeno and Taigete, Elettra and Sterope, together with the most holy Maia”. (Cicero, “Aratea”)
At this point a consideration needs to be made.
In the ancient world what was sacred on earth was often a reflection of what was in the sky: for example, Mount Taigete (Sparta) took its name from the Pleiade mother of Sparta’s “founder”, Lacedaemon.
Here, as the Roman encyclopedist Marcus Terentium Varro: “Where now stands Roma, there was once the Septimountius, so called for the number of mountains that the city later included within its walls.”
We know that the Septimountius does not correspond to the Seven Hills of Rome, but the concept of the Seven Hills could itself be the result of a schematization that reduced the number of the hills of the territory that extends on the left bank of the Tiber.
This semplification would seem pointless, but perhaps the aim was to make the hills correspond to the Seven Pleiades; in fact, even the arrangement of the hills seems to respect that of the “seven stars pleiades”.
The Palatine Mount, on which Romulus traced the furrow of the Urbe, corresponds to “the most holy Maia”.
In the story of the foundation, we find another probable allusion to the Pleiades: Remus on the Aventine Mount and Romulus on Palatine Mount saw, respectively, 6 and 12 bird flying (as mentioned 6 and 12 are the Pleiades visible from the Earth by eye).
We must remember that the Pleaides are part of the constellation of Taurus, whose zodiac sign begins on April 21st… The foundation of Rome has as date April 21st 753 b.C. .
It cannot be excluded that even the number of the Seven King of Rome originated, rather than from a historical foundation, from the need for sacred numerology in which the number “seven” holds a prominent place.
A small detail to keep in mind, is that Ovid was originally from Sulmona, a city at the feet of the Maiella Mountain Massif, consacrated preciselt to the Pleaide Maia.
It is therefore possible that an educated Roman, starting from the passage written by Ovid, was able to understand that the city born from Romulus’ furrow, was consecrated to the Pleiade Maia, considered by Ovid himself, the most beautiful one.
For the ancient Romans, the Lares were divinities who protected and safeguarded the individual, the family and the home. The divinity that is introduced in the verses is called “Bona Dea” (good goddess) and it too had a protective function.
Even the real name of the “Bona Dea” was never to be spoken; the first to reveal it, was Macrobius in the V century a.C. by whuch time the pagan world was almost at an end.
Macrobius confirms that behind the “Bona Dea” was hidden Maia.
It is therefore no coincidence that Ovid dedicates the opening line of the book of and about May to her.
The sentence in the graphic specifies a relationship between Vulcan and Maia, in which the god offered a pregnant sow as a sacrifice to Maia, every 1st of May, so that the earth would be pregnant with fruit.
Vulcan represented the protective fire; this places him at Maia’s service in the defense of the city.
The juxtaposition between Maia and the “Bona Dea” allows us to see from a new perspective an episode that took place decades earlier, which involved, among others, Cicero and Cesare.
P. Clodio. Pulcro, one of the most discussed characters in the entire Roman history, on the night of the 4th of December in 62 b.C., disguised himself as a woman to secretly participate in a very secret ritual of the cult of the “Bona Dea” to which the women of the aristocracy were responsible, which was carried out privately in the residence of a high magistrate’s wife and in the presence of the latter and the Vestals (thus indicates the importance of this rite): that night the rite took place in the home of Cesare, that at the time was Pontifex Maximus.
Pulcro was discovered and underwent a trial in which he risked the death penalty, whilst against him testified Cicero.
Cesare, who as Pontifex Maximus, was one of the few who knew the truth about Rome’s secret name, divorced his wife after that deplorable episode. This shows how important the rite was.
If naming the true patroness of Rome was such a serious crime, why didn’t Augustus kill Ovid?
Calliope’s speech seems to have been cut: in fact, she never mentions Romulus, while the other two muses whom Ovid makes speak before her, do it.
It is therefore possible that Emperor Augustus had the compromised verses eliminated. Those were the verses in which it was stated that Romulus gave the secret name to Rome (a fact present in many latin and non-latin sources), following the prophecy on the place where Rome would be born.
In conclusion, Emperor Augustus granted clemency because Ovid, it seems, never mentioned Maia’s name directly.
But there were, probably, also political reasons for this choice.

AOG, Sitges
Word of advice number one: when you next go on vacation, don’t wear new shoes on the flight.
Why? Well, it could be that the airline looses your luggage and you are doomed to wear the same pair of new shoes for days on end. And your feet will not forgive you.
Word of advice number two: Never, ever, go to Rome in August. Not if you value your life and well being in general. And especially not if you are adverse to high temperatures.
Our friends had warned us against this.
“Don’t go, it is too hot!”, they said.
“Never in August. You’ll die from the heat!”, they warned.
Did we listen? Well, of course not.
Our logic?
“Well, we always say we won’t go in August and that we’ll go some other time, but then we never go”, said my partner. I agreed. My partner was right. We always say we’ll go some other time, but then we never do.
So a couple of years ago we decided to go to Rome and check out the Eternal City.
E t e r n a l mistake on our part!
After paying Vueling Airlines (a low cost airline) for 2 pieces of luggage, we arrived at Rome’s Fiumicino Airport with a slight delay, but no suitcases.
We only discovered this after waiting for our bags for over an hour at belt #9.
I went to the baggage handling company in charge of our flight (turns out there’s more than one. Blessed capitalism!) and they told us they had no record of our bags on their system.
Yes, having been to the country in the past, in fact, as recently as last June, my first thought was “typical Italian efficiency”, but I was wrong to think that. The problem was not typical Italian efficiency, it was typical Spanish negligence.
As we would find out the next day, the bags had never left Barcelona.
The Italian handler made us fill a form; he put our details into the computer, and sent us off on our less than merry way with a reference number which, we would later discover, was incorrect.
Although no consolation at all, we were not the only people without luggage on our flight, there was, at least, one other.
So there we were at Rome’s airport with a driver waiting to take us into town for 50 Euros, something we thought would be a good idea since we didn’t know the city and we wanted not to worry about the bags.
He was very nice, and if he was upset at having waited for over an hour, he didn’t let on.
We got into his Ford Focus and made our way to the Città Eterna.
I have to say that the drive went pretty well, and that the country side was not exactly very pretty. It was, all in all, a bit odd.
First we were on a highway, then, after a while, we found ourselves in what can only be describe as ‘leafy suburbs’.
He didn’t take any major roads and, instead, chose one-way roads with large, tall, walls, behind which I can only imagine must hide beautiful private villas.
It was a long while before we approached something which resembled the outskirts of a large city.
Once there what we saw first was the usual dim urban landscape, typical of any major European city post 1950.
Large, ugly, square, brick and concrete buildings, with many stores along the way selling mostly urban goods: fast food joints, urban clothing stores, ugly furniture shops, and the odd newspaper stand.
Still, we were excited to be in Rome.
I mean, R O M E !!
Right?
Then, suddenly, something which would happen again and again -though we didn’t know it at the time- occurred: when we least expected it, and just before we entered a tunnel, out of the corner of our left eyes, we caught a glimpse of St. Peter’s, in The Vatican.
This was unexpected because we had thought that we would view that particular monument going up the Via Della Concilliazione and into St. Peter’s Square, like almost everyone else.
But it was not to be. We quickly crossed the Tiber and drove down the Corso Vittorio Emanuelle II and into our hotel near the Campo de Fiori.
We paid our driver, gave him a tip, then checked in.
The hotel was ok. The recepcionist was not really friendly and did that thing which so often happens in Europe, he spoke as if HE was doing you a favor.
As if HE was paying for you to stay at the hotel. Not rude, just a bit…what’s the word… condescending and aloof.
Regardless, we had gone to Rome to enjoy the place and that is what we wanted to do. So we quickly forgot about him.
We had asked for a room with a balcony, and they gave us that, which was nice. But we soon discovered that the a/c was, well, less than able. It made a lot of noise, but gave out little cold air. But I would only realize this later in the day. And especially so at night.
We were starving by now and wanted to a) see the city and b) get some clothes. We had nothing to wear. Only the clothes we had on and which, by now, were very sweaty. Did I mention Rome was hot?
We left the hotel, which was, it seemed, used to situations such as ours. “You’ll get your bags tomorrow”, said the receptionist/owner, and off we went to eat and do some shopping.
We found a small restaurant about 3 minutes away and sat down. We ordered one pizza for the both of us and something to drink. It was the best pizza we would have during the whole trip. It was that good.
The service, however, was pretty bad. I wouldn’t say it went downhill from there, but rather that the service in Rome was consistently bad day in, day out.
Our waiters over the next few days, it would seem, would find new and creative ways in which to outdo their colleague’s ‘performance’ throughout our stay. And no, we hardly spent a penny on tips while in Rome.
So, after having lunch and stopping off at the local grocery shop where we got basic eating and drinking supplies, as well as some toiletries, it was back to the hotel, quick shower, and out before the stores closed.
Rome was baking under the sun, and us with it.
Out we went into the Corso Vittorio Emanuele II and started walking East, with no particular place to go. Also, we didn’t really know which way to go. We were torn between wanting to see the sights, and our clothing needs, so we tried to concentrate very little on what we saw, hard to do since if you’ve never been to Rome, everything is new to you, even when nine or ten centuries old. Or more.
Eventually, we got to Via del Corso, but not before we stumbled on the Piazza Venezia and the enormous marble and stone behemoth to our right: the monument to King Vittorio Emanuele II, first King of Italy.
This is one of the monuments on my list which I would not really arrive at the way I had expected. When I say we stumbled, I mean it. It is gigantic, but it is not exactly by a major road, it is on a major square, but off to the right, so if you happen to be on the street and not turn right, you might not exactly see it. But then, once you do, you can’t see anything else.
I wanted to go to it (yes, its array of classical columns was calling me) and bask in its classical ‘interpretative’ colossal beauty, but it was not to be on that first day.
We had no time, it was hot, and we needed clothes.
We turned into the Via del Corso, and forgot about it.
Via del Corso is one of those major shopping streets in central Rome. Many of the major brands, and others not so major, are there. Although Rome’s high class shopping strip is the Via Condotti, which is further down the Via del Corso, to the right.
On the corner, just as you go into Corso, there is the Doria-Pamphilj Palace.
Serene and decorated in a wedding cake style, I was immediately drawn to it.
But didn’t go, and would, unfortunately, not get to go during the trip.
And that pretty much sums up the entire trip. I didn’t get to see, go or do many things.
So back to the Via del Corso, and our shopping. We had nothing to wear the next day, and clothes were urgently needed. So we spent the best part of the afternoon traipsing from store to store, looking for garments, and missing out on Rome altogether.
On a side note, I must point out that, by now, my partner and I were wondering how the people of Italy reproduced since, it was very obvious, all the men in that country were gay.
But I digress…Clothes-wise, our main hope turned out to be H&M, but, once we got there, almost at the end of the Corso, we discovered, much to our dismay, that there was no Men’s section there.
Can you believe it?
We had walked the entire length of the Corso in the hope of finding a place which might have something -overpriced- but my size. Fat chance.
Since at that point we were only about two blocks from the Piazza del Popolo, we decided to go there.
I have to say that by now, I was ready to be impressed, or something, and impressed I was.
I had long wanted to see the twin churches of Santa Maria in Montesanto (1662-75) and Santa Maria dei Miracoli (built 1675-79). And there they were, in all their Baroque beauty. I think this is the one time Rome got interesting that day. I would say it made the whole thing worthwhile, but it isn’t true.The day had sucked all along from the minute our luggage went missing. But that moment, when we walked into that space, covered in fatigue and sweat, the city seemed beautiful, the tourists a mere nuisance, the heat (and it was around 8:30 PM) almost tolerable.
It was magic. Rome was magic.
We stopped at the obelisk in the middle of the Piazza, an original comission of Sety I (later erected by Rameses II) from Heliopolis which stands in the centre of the Piazza, inside a fountain, and is the second oldest and one of the tallest obelisks in Rome (some 24 m high, or 36 m including its plinth).
It was brought to Rome in 10 BC by order of Augustus and originally set up in the Circus Maximus.
Once there, a tourist girl asked her friend if she could drink from the fountain. My partner overheard her and told her that he’d read that you could drink from any fountain in Rome, unless it specifically said not to.
She was happy about this, and we spoke with her for a couple more minutes. Turns out she was from Spain, and was there on holiday with a couple more friends from school. She must have been in her very early 20s. And she was lovely.
It was starting to get dark, and we decided to get back to the hotel. We couldn’t decide between catching a bus, taking the subway, or walking. So we walked back along the dark and not too busy streets of, as it turns out, downtown Rome. Soon we were back at the hotel, where there were no news about our luggage.
The hotel’s concierge really couldn’t care less, so we went to our room, had a shower and went out to have dinner, not too sure about where to do this.
We decided to follow the incoming crowd down one of the streets, and ended up at the Campo dei Fiori. It was teeming with life: children playing, musicians, flower vendors, Indian or Pakistani salesmen of trinkets.
In short, Touristland right there in front of us. The only Italians being the waiters at the Campo’s many restaurants. So in we walked, and decided that the one on the right, on the other side of La Carbonara Restaurant, where we should have dined, just as you walked in, would do. Mistake. The food, although ok once we got it, did not surpass the bad service of a place which doubled as a drinks bar and dance club after 11PM.
We kept getting food meant for other tables, everything arrived at odd intervals, drinks had to be ordered more than twice. In short, a mess.
But given the day’s big story, it really paled in comparison. We didn’t mind much that the service was so bad. I think we were relieved it was over more than anything else!
Afterwards, we went for a walk on the Tiber, and saw that, at night, it really came alive. What a beautiful city this is.
It seems like the good citizens of Rome have allowed for bars and stands to be set up alongside the banks of the river. We were immediately drawn by the music and the bright, intermitent, lights of the marquees.
We crossed the bridge, and went down to the riverbank. We saw a couple of small stands which were a sort of Godsend since they had one of the items we needed most: a phone charger!
Yes, ours were safely (we hoped) stored inside our suitcases, and these, somewhere in Europe. We then decided to go to one of the “bars”. A rugby-themed bar by the side of the Tiber showing New Zealand’s Rugby matches.
Yes, slightly surreal, but then Rome is slightly surreal.
We would have stayed longer, but we were beat. We had had a long day and were yearning for sleep.
So after a couple of drinks, we headed back to the hotel. The room was not exactly cold, although the imitation a/c had been on all afternoon, so we agreed to sleep with the balcony window open. And the air con on. So our first day in Rome ended.

An Italian Summer — Part I
This is Part I of my travelogue An Italian Summer — starting with the eternal city of Rome.
Rome was not built in a day. No surprises — it took us four days to visit it and we were left wanting for more.
Rome is a veritable explosion of ancient history, art and culture. That also means it is thronged by enthusiastic tourists throughout the summer, and it is wise to plan in advance in order to avoid long queues and inconvenience.
The central location of our hotel — the Westin Excelsior — ensured we could reach most places of interest on foot, and get public transport for the others with ease. You will spend a lot of time outdoors in Rome, so choose location over amenities while picking a place of stay.
Let me walk you through our itinerary, answering some of the why’s and what’s alongwith.
We landed in Rome past noon-time on 3rd September and got ourselves a local SIM card and picked up our Roma Pass at the Airport.
There are a lot of posts on the internet debating whether the Roma pass is a good investment. Unless you are planning to vegetate at the Hotel, it is a no-brainer. It includes entry to the Colosseum & Forum, plus unlimited access to the public transport (Metro & Bus).
Get a cab from the Airport to the city centre, usually costs about €50–60. We freshened up at the Hotel, got ourselves a light lunch and started walking where our feet would take us.
The evening brought about an array of flavours. We ambled across the cobbled streets, got hold of every photo-op against pretty street cafes, saw miniature and life-size versions of wooden Pinocchios, and got our first lick of authentic Italian Gelato.
By the way, amidst all this, we also saw the Trevi fountain and climbed up the Spanish steps and saw a lovely sunset with a street musician singing Ed Sheeran in the background. The city of Rome is a gigantic museum — you just cannot stay away from history and architectural beauty.
We trooped back to the hotel early. Streets in Rome get rather desolate by about 9 pm, and roaming around on foot is not advisable.
The Roma pass includes priority access to the Colosseum (€18, otherwise). However, the authorities have placed a concurrent visitors restriction due to which one must also reserve a time slot at a cost of €2 per person here.
We had a slot for 12 noon so we had a relaxed start to the day. We had breakfast this day, and also the next 2 days, at this handy cafe called Xtra One Coffee at Via Lombardia. At our designated time, we entered the Colosseum through a priority channel, smirking at the long queues sweating it out for an entry. GET PRIORITY ENTRY EVERYWHERE YOU GO!
It is an awe-inspiring visual as one enters the colossal stadium. Though, thanks to repair work in arena area, there were steel scaffolds which ruined the authenticity of the surroundings. We plugged into Rick Steves’ audio tour as we entered and, while listening to its ‘bloody’ past, we roamed around its many tiers.
After a wholesome tour, we stepped out across the road to Ristoro Della Salute. And we were back in the queue for the Roman Forum by half past two. We spent a good half an hour waiting here (there’s no skipping this line). But it was well worth it.
Having read Julius Caesar as part of my ICSE syllabus, I was thrilled to be where it all transpired. The Via Sacra, Caesar’s grave, the Rostrum where Cicero and Antony spoke, the Vestal Virgins — it was like reading a book. and Rick Steves’ guide did complete justice to the experience, yet again.
Our next stop was the adjacent Palatine Hill (that’s where the word palace comes from) housing lush gardens and remnants of Rome’s glorious history. To be honest, if one intends to get into the details of the monuments scattered on this hill as well, it would be hard to do it the same day as the Colosseum and the Forum. The place shuts at 6pm, a fact that deprived us of a potentially lovely sunset from a vantage point situated inside.
After a long day, we headed to the nearby Gran Caffe Martini & Rossi to get an early dinner and some Sangria. What followed ranks among our top memories from the trip: a view of the Colosseum by night. That surreal picture summed up almost everything anyone asks for from Rome.
And that was Day 2.
This was our day of casual ‘walking around the city’ in between visits to the Colosseum and to the Vatican the day after. The idea was not to burn ourselves out in the first few days of the trip.
Rick Steves came to our rescue again. We picked up his walking guide “Heart of Rome” and headed out on the streets of Rome with our backpacks.
A bus ride from Bissolati to C.so Vittorio Emanuele, and we were at our first stop — Campo de’ Fiori, a lively market square with a dark history of public execution.
The colorful, busy market made for a great start. From here, we meandered through tourist laden streets, with historical nuggets strewn all around, to a centerpiece of Baroque art and architecture — Piazza Navona. The vast plaza is adorned with three majestic fountains including Bernini’s Fountain of Four Rivers, and Boromini’s imposing church facing them.
It was lunch time. While the piazza is lined with restaurants, we resisted the obvious options and walked into one of the adjacent lanes, and didn’t regret it one bit. As we walked the Via di Tor Milina, we bumped into merry accordion players, street bands playing with gusto and enthusiastic restaurant waiters offering us a ‘better’ deal. We chose a place closest to the music and downed some food with a serving of the much talked about Aperol Spritz.
With a fuller belly, we moved on to the iconic Pantheon, a monument preserved exceedingly well for its ~1900 year old history. Rick Steves has a dedicated audio tour of the Pantheon — you don’t need any guide thanks to that.
From here, Rick Steves was egging us to head to the familiar Trevi & Spanish steps area, so we looked beyond. Close to the Pantheon lies Largo di Torre Argentina, an important ruin and site of the murder of Julius Caesar — the senate was meeting across town on the day he was slain. Close to this was the Campidoglio — a hilltop square designed by Michelangelo with a statue of Marcus Aurelius on his horse marking the center and facades of conservatories marking its periphery. We spent some time visiting some of the relics housed in these buildings. These are covered under the Roma pass and could consume a good two hours if you are really into ancient relics.
Stepping out of the Campidoglio, we walked up the Altar of the Fatherland built in honor of Victor Emanuelle II in the early 20th century and boasting of an impressive facade. We could only spent about 20 minutes here since they evacuate tourists at 6pm.
Late evening took us back to the Spanish steps (a steep climb again!) and then to the Trevi fountain for a night time view which is highly recommended. We had an early start for the Vatican next day and we hadn’t really gotten rid of the jet lag, so this ended up to be another early night.
We had booked an escorted priority entrance to the Vatican on headout.com at 8am! While Vatican is accessible by train (Ottavio metro station), we took a cab and grabbed breakfast on the way. We made it in the nick of time only to be told that we were the only 2 people booked for the slot, and we could wait 30 minutes and join a full guided tour with 6–7 other folks, at no extra cost. w00t w00t!
Surely, the Gods had intervened. I have rarely ever gone for human guides, but the Vatican is a giant maze and it is highly recommended to book a full tour. It helped that our guide was knowledgeable and witty to match.
Keep a good 3–4 hours for a full tour of the Vatican, the Sistine Chapel and St. Peter’s Basilica (perhaps more if you want to climb up the Basilica’s steps to the dome). Even as you step out to the Vatican square, the plaza looks resplendent with fountains and an array of statues lining the surrounding buildings’ rooftops. Covering your knees and shoulders is advisable.
As we stepped out of the Vatican, we spotted a McDonald’s and that was lunch because, well, we needed a break from pizza & pasta. Already.
Before heading to Trastevere for our last evening in Rome, we did a detour to the Chiesa di Santa Maria della Vittoria which houses Bernini’s sculpture The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa — a statue you might remember from Dan Brown’s Angels & Demons. It is a church as grand as any other and an item checked off the bucket-list.
Trastevere is the trans-Tiber section of Rome. Due to its quaint and bohemian buildings and houses, Trastevere is pretty Instagram-friendly. There is an audio tour by Rick Steves on Trastevere as well, and we spent the first hour or so getting to know the history of the commune, walking the neighbourhood, and visiting the Church of Cecilia & that of Santa Maria.
It was Friday evening and weekend revelry was in the air. We passed a number of piazzas where locals had got together to enjoy some food, drinks and music. As the evening set in, we went back to Piazza Trilussa and saw an exhilarating band performance. Ponte Sisto — the bridge in front of the Piazza was also abuzz with street artists and beat boxers. It was a far cry from the vibe of central Rome, and it won’t be far-fetched to say that this was indeed the Heart of Rome.
We found a quieter alley for dinner at a fine restaurant called Latteria Trastevere. And with a long-ish goodbye walk, we boarded the tram from Trastevere to Venezia, where, to our surprise, there was a traffic stop due to a night marathon. So, we had to wait for half an hour under the Roman night-sky before taking a cab back to the hotel.
It was our last night there. We weren’t complaining.
Rome is a city that keeps giving. Every day spent, even visits to the same sites, at times, offered us a fresh perspective or a yet-unseen relic.
It is a modern capital city with its roots firmly planted in its past — be it the well-maintained ancient monuments, the social piazzas or the water pumps providing water to passersby — each one of them telling tales from a history as old as time itself.

January 4, 2022|Italy
As expected, very late last night, Boo and I got our test results back for the PCR tests we took late yesterday afternoon. Negative for COVID. So yay!
Except . . . when I went to wake up Boo this morning, she told me that during the night, she had a headache and sore throat. She had taken ibuprofen and the symptoms went away And she felt fine this morning.
So we went about our day as planned. We took a walking tour through Ancient Rome. We met the group near Trajan’s column then walked past ”the wedding cake,” the monument to the king who united Italy.
Our guide was OK. Informative but not that entertaining. On the upside, he didn’t sing, so that was a blessing.
The guide took us up the hill behind the wedding cake where we had a glorious view over the rooftops of Rome. We were there at the stroke of noon, so we could hear bells peal across the city.

I first visited Rome back in 2015, and it remains my favourite European city to this day.
Mainstream, I know. “What’s your favourite song, Wonderwall?”, I hear you ask.
Well, no (although I do love Oasis). Just hear me out.
I’m a firm believer that Rome’s reputation has suffered because it’s so popular. It’s as though people refuse to judge the city on its merit, so widespread is the knowledge of its undeniable appeal. Sometimes it’s important to take a step back, and to try and refresh one’s perspective.
I often struggle with cities. I don’t understand the appeal of London, living some 90 minutes away from it myself, and I’ve found the energy of big cities a little oppressive at various times in my life.
That wasn’t the case in Rome, though.
Down every street, and round every corner, there’s something to marvel at — some unwavering reminder of what our species has achieved, and how it has evolved.

The day out of Levanto was an early morning because of the train tickets we’d booked in Venice. We took a regional train to La Spieza, south of Cinque Terre and then a direct train to Rome. This train was different in that it had booths of 6 seats each. I asked Yuki if she felt like she was going to Hogwarts.
We arrived in Rome and had to walk 2km to the Airbnb apartment. We were surprised that a city steeped in such history would be covered in so much graffiti. It covers a lot of buildings, most train cars, all municipal work vehicles, and any spot like tunnels or under bridges that are easily accessible and discrete. At the same time, the cobblestone streets made it difficult to drag our suitcases and the narrow sidewalks littered with garbage were a constant obstacle course. For all the problems, it is perhaps surprising that the drivers almost always stop for you to cross the road if you step out in front of them. They don’t try to ignore you or speed behind you like in Canada. So at first we were hesitant to cross the road but soon became accustomed to finding a break in traffic and forcing the next car to slow down and stop for us.
We were pleasantly surprised that the Airbnb apartment was actually a one bedroom place and that we got our own room again.
Probably my favourite part of Rome is that there are ruins everywhere. We went out to see one attraction and on our way to finding a subway line we stumbled upon the Piazza di Porta Maggorie. There is a tram station beside the ruins of what use to be Rome’s old city wall where an aqueduct cuts through at 30m high and one of the gates to the city was a tomb to a slave that was freed and became wealthy as a baker.
Further on we walked beside the remains of an aqueduct, one of 11 that use to feed the 1 million inhabitants of ancient Rome. The aqueduct and city walls have openings which have roads going through them. Some of them are the original gates repurposed for roads but others are just large demolitions cut out of the wall.
Our attraction of the day was the Spanish Steps, located in the North East of the city. Photos made it look appealing but when we arrived around dinner time the square was packed with tourists and the stairs had become a de facto public bench. We walked up and read that the stairs were significant for connecting two parts of town at different elevations. Otherwise, there isn’t much to them and we were less impressed.
Surprisingly, we found a family run restaurant with an enthusiastic and very happy greeter and waiter. This fun meal would be an abnormally of our time in Rome where the restaurant was happy, joked around, and cared about the service and food that they served. For the remainder of our time in Rome, we would have difficulty finding good food and service.
Our day of sight seeing in Rome began later than expected but we took a tram and one of two subway lines to the Colosseum. There are hawkers everywhere trying to get you to join a tour group. They offered entrance in the next few minutes for 30 euros and said that the line was 2hr. In reality, the line was about half an hour and admission without any guide costs 11 Euro. It would seem, however, that tour groups would be the normal for all of Italy. Everywhere we went, we were mobbed by tourist groups, whether formed by a company or a sole person at the entrance. Some of the larger attractions also have self-guided audio tours and many people can be found standing awkwardly around the attraction holding half of a phone up to their ear.
Needless to say, Yuki and I didn’t use any guides. This meant that we didn’t actually learn anything while visiting the historic sites as there aren’t really any display boards. The only learning we did was by reading up on wikipedia after the fact.The tour groups looked slow and the tour guides seemed to drone on and on so it was nice to be able to go at our own pace and wander around instead of being stuck to a set path.
I wasn’t all that impressed by the Eiffel tower in Paris but the Colosseum was massively impressive. Stepping out of the metro station, the scale and size of the Colosseum is enormous. Even in ruin, it is wonderful in shape and form. From the outside, the form of the Colosseum is beautiful, with each successive arch and while deteriorated and broken, it is easy to image how much grandeur there would have been back in ancient Rome.
Entering the Colosseum was also spectacular. It is interesting to note that tickets to events at the Colosseum were free but seating was arranged by social standing with the wealthiest at the lower bowl and the poor, furthest at the top. Each of the arches at the base of the Coliseum was an entrance that lead directly to the intended seats. This eliminated cross contamination between social classes but also was incredibly efficient in moving people in and out of the stadium.
We walked around the lower bowl for photos and peered down into the galleries below the originally wood arena. The signboards said how there use to be mock naval battles but stopped after a renovation. it wasn’t clear if that renovation had to do with adding the basement or a perimeter wall. I cannot imagine how they would be able to flood the arena with a wood floor and not only support the weight of the water but also be waterproof at the same time.
After the Colosseum we had to wander around for a bit to find a place to eat, which was the normal Italian food, and then we sat outside the Basilica di San Pietro for a while because they close for lunch. Of note, there are some religious artifacts, including chains that held Saint Peter and a statue of Moses by Michelangelo. There were also some other tombs adored with skeletons which we found odd and the roof had a nice painting on it.
Then we walked back to the Coliseum to visit the adjacent Roman Forums. The ticket to the Colosseum includes the Roman Forums and Palatine Hill across the street. This is where the Roman government buildings were located and is nearby to a wealthy neighbourhood. What is most impressive about the forums is the height of some of the ruins, indicating that some buildings were huge.
The Forums are mostly ruins now but I was struct by how a much of it is brick. It seems that the romans built predominantly in brick and covered the structures in a concrete paste or marble. I’d known about the romans and concrete before but I didn’t realize that it was used as mortar between bricks and not contemporary concrete with aggregates and moulds. Only certain buildings, or parts of buildings, are constructed from stone.
By the end of the forums we were too tired to walk up Palatine Hill so we planned on coming back the next day because the tickets are valid for two consecutive days.
The next item on our list of places to visit was Trevi Fountain. We found a shop before the fountain where we bought postcards for 0.4 euro each. We thought this was pretty good because they can be as high as 1 and are usually 0.5 or above but we found another store later that had them for 0.3 euro. Oh well.
The fountain is probably the most photographed in Rome. It was also crowded and so it felt like a lot of the other attractions where we only had enough time to get in, take our photos, and get out. There didn’t seem to be any time to appreciate or enjoy each place, especially with the crowds.
From Trevi fountain we walked to the Pantheon, passing the Piazza Colonna, which is significant because the tall round marble Column of Marcus Aurelius recounts the conquest of the Emperor in relief carvings that spiral up to a statue at the top.
The Pantheon was as large as I’d expected it to be and enormously voluminous inside. Looking at the roof, we knew that the square recesses were to reduce the weight of the roof but we wondered instead why the roof couldn’t be thinner. Like the Colosseum and the Roman Forums, the exterior was all brick. Apparently it used to be faced in marble but over the centuries that was scavenged away.
After the Pantheon we walked to the Piazza Navonna which has another impressive, but smaller fountain. We took a peak inside the Saint Agnese but there was a Sunday service in progress and the space was surprisingly small, although ordinate.
We had our worst lunch lunch afterwards at a restaurant just outside the square. The service was terrible and the food wasn’t that great either. The worst part was that the waiter tried to take 5 euros tip from us and I had to yell at him to get all our money back. For hearing that Paris waiters were snobs, we didn’t have a problem there and found that Italy was generally much worse in the tourist areas but very good in the local parts.
We were going to take the bus back to Palatine Hill but we couldn’t find a place to buy tickets so we decided to cheap out and just walk back. Along the way we stopped at the Piazza Venezia and took photos of the Altare della Patria. This monument is a modern symbol to the city of Rome and has some newer statues.
There are a lot of steps to climb on the way up and the view from the top is okay, but not great. It’s possible to go to the top by elevator but it cost 7 euro and we didn’t think it was worthwhile. In some ways, this building gives an idea to the grandeur of ancient Rome and what it must have been like in the past.
At the edge of the Roman Forums we realized that we’d forgotten yesterday’s tickets so we weren’t able to get back in. Instead we walked around to the Circuit Maximus but I was disappointed to find a sloping field with barely any trace of a race course. The Circuit Maximus use to be the largest chariot race track in the Roman Empire and was also used for many ceremonies and parades. Today, it could be mistaken for an undeveloped site as there’s nothing but a walking path.
For dinner we tried to go to Sushi but it was a high class place with a long line up. Instead we went to a take-away shop but it took an hour for them to prepare it. Still, Yuki got her much desired sushi and we have a good dinner at home of the type of food we wanted to eat.
Yuki’s Dad wanted to visit the Vatican so we went there. It took us a long time to get through security because I picked the wrong line. There was a mass of people that split into four lines. The first two lines had a security checkpoint each but the second two lines funneled into a single checkpoint. We were in the second line and the people around us were quite aggressive to get to the front of each other.
Saint Peter’s Basilica, had been described to us as a lot of dead saints. Like all the other religious sites, it was highly decorated in gold paintings and large but wasn’t that interesting to us. Turns out, there are a lot of dead saints. We considered visiting the Sistine Chapel but it seemed far and likely to have a long line so we walked through the Basilica’s grotto and then went for lunch.
Everyone looked forward to lunch at McDonalds because it is a dependable staple to be the same everywhere in the world. At least, almost the same. The taste was slightly different but it was a welcome relief to all the plain food we’ve been having lately. We never thought that we would be so eager to eat at McDonalds for lunch.
The last place to visit in Rome was the Baths of Caracalla which we discovered was very close to the Circuit Maximus we visited the day before. We had to transfer between the two subway lines at the Rome train station so we also used that opportunity to buy tickets for Yuki’s parents to get to the airport as they would be going alone the next day. As with all things family related, it took a lot of explaining in three different languages to get the message through to her Dad who speaks English and Japanese and her mom who speaks Japanese and Thai. Yuki’s patience seem almost angelic for all the explaining and translating she has to do.
Frustratingly, the Baths closed early on Monday so we walked to them for nothing. Frances, who had visited Rome in August, recommended going to the Pyramide metro station and Eatalia, a department store of restaurants. It turned out to be a station beyond Pyramide so we had a tiresome walk and the building was actually more of an expensive health food store. There were three levels with restaurants but the main business was selling healthy foods and the restaurants looked posh. Dejected, we backtracked to a Ramen restaurant we’d passed walking there and ate a small early dinner because we were all still full on McDonalds for lunch.

The OUP blog has an excerpt from Bryan Ward-Perkin’s The Fall of Rome.
It is currently deeply unfashionable to state that anything like a ‘crisis’ or a ‘decline’ occurred at the end of the Roman empire, let alone that a ‘civilization’ collapsed and a ‘dark age’ ensued. The new orthodoxy is that the Roman world, in both East and West, was slowly, and essentially painlessly, ‘transformed’ into a medieval form. However, there is an insuperable problem with this new view: it does not fit the mass of archaeological evidence now available…
The Fall of Rome is one of these things that varies from whatever perspective you take. I remember my Roman lecturer on my BA commenting that many historians felt Rome went into terminal decline during the third century. Over two hundred years, he dryly noted, must have been some decline. The British Empire has collapsed in the last century, are we walking in the ruins of a one mighty empire?
Yet Ward-Perkins is right. There is a change. Pottery becomes pretty cruddy stuff. Writing becomes much much rarer. Civic centres fall. If civilisation is living in cities, then there is definitely a collapse of civilisation. While it might not be visible over the course of a lifetime, it is there. It depends what questions you ask of the data. The grand durée of history doesn’t disappear simply because the individual becomes the fashionable thing to study in the Thatcherite era.
I remember being taught that Saxons didn’t really invade, they came over as farmers. The Vikings didn’t invade either, they were peaceful farmers with a bad press. It makes you wonder how and why a lot of weapons came to be invented with all these peaceful farmers going everywhere. Perhaps an understanding of barbarians might remind us why civilisation might be a good idea.

To celebrate my 50th birthday, my best friend and I embarked on our first European adventure, with Rome as our initial destination. Upon our arrival, we were immediately struck by the city’s incredible scale and beauty. “Everything is so grand!” became our catchphrase — and it truly was. Down every street and around every corner, something extraordinary awaited. In the open-air museum that is Rome, forget the car, put on your walking shoes, and get ready to log 15,000 steps/day discovering the city’s landmarks and hidden treasures.
Before experiencing Rome in person, we’d spent months laying out our itinerary, starting with a Google map where we pinpointed the places we wanted to visit and marked the center with a figurative X. When we arrived in Italy, what had appeared on the map as a web of gray lines connecting landmarks was transformed into living, breathing Roman arteries bursting with vibrant culture and sensory delights. Serendipitously, the focal point marked by an X landed us in the heart of Rome at the Palazzo Navona Hotel, situated next to the Piazza Navona. It proved to be the perfect launching point for our three-day exploration of the Eternal City.

I took a three-day trip to Italy on New Years. It was always my dream to visit the great Ancient Rome, so you can imagine how excited I was for this trip. Throughout my visit, I experienced some wonderful places, great food, and met new people. I want to share with you the rookie mistakes that I made, the things I did right, and ultimately what I learned from this experience. Here are some tips for navigating your way through the beautiful city of Rome.
Pack well (and right!!): Extra clothes, check, portable charger, check, type C, F, and L power outlet plugs, not check. Seriously, I spent the first half of my day there looking for electronic stores with the correct power outlet adapters. I made a rookie mistake, and hopefully, you will not have to.
Don’t pay extra. If anyone tries to convince you that you have to pay to get into the Vatican, I will assure you that you don’t. As soon as I arrived at the Vatican, I was unpleasantly approached by a man who apparently had only two tickets left to sell for the Vatican. Most might think that they “got lucky” and that they had just made it there in time before tickets were sold out, but that isn’t the case at all. Just keep your head up and walk right into the Vatican. It’s free. Thankfully, binge-watching travel videos on youtube helped me with that one.
Take lots of pictures. If you are traveling along, you can even ask tourists to take photos of you! As a solo traveler, I had plenty of time to soak in all the views and take my time appreciating all the sights and wonders. It is nice to take some pictures so you can reminisce later (who knows when you’ll be back). If you want to take some pictures of yourself, ask tourists if they’d be willing to take it for you, you’d be surprised how much photography talent there is in the crowd. If you see someone who could use a hand, offer to help them take their picture, they might offer to take yours back. Well, hey, it worked for me.
Plan well! I packed my day with wonderful sightseeing adventures and activities. It is crucial to check openings of the different places, especially on holidays. Unfortunately, I missed out on the great opportunity of seeing the Sistine Chapel because it was closed on the new year.
Throw a coin (or two) into the Trevi Garden. Legend has it that if you throw a coin over your head into the Trevi Fountain, chances are, you will return to Rome. If you throw two, you will return to Rome and fall in love, and three, you will return to Rome, fall in love, and get married there. I don’t know if this has been proven correct, but it can’t hurt to take your chances either way. Unluckily, I didn’t get to throw coins into the fountain, but have no doubt; I shall return.
Check out what Italy is known for, then make sure not to miss out. I enjoyed some delicious Italian Ice Cream, Pizza, and House Wine. The wine is incredibly affordable in Italy. While in the restaurant, don’t rush to receive the bill. It is customary in Italy to stick around and have a conversation after a nice meal.
Fly Ryanair! This one is a little bit controversial. If you asked me then if I would fly Ryanair again, I would have said that I would absolutely not. Looking back though, I realize how convenient it was to have a cheap flight from London to Rome. Just make sure you read exactly what you need to do when buying the ticket so they won’t charge you extra for late check-in or carry-on bags. If you don’t want to experience flight delays though, don’t fly with Ryanair. They might have cheaper flights, but that doesn’t mean they come without a cost.
I hope asome of these travelling tips helped you out! I know that I need to take some of my own advice on my next trip to Rome.
Edit: This blog is a repost from 3 years ago when I first visited Rome. Hope you enjoy!

Playing as Carthage in Total War: Rome 2 using the DEI mod.,https://medium.com/@thomas-dee/playing-as-carthage-in-total-war-rome-2-using-the-dei-mod-15100fb54253,"Sign up

For those unfamiliar with the Total war franchise it is essentially the dream game for military-history nerds like myself. It allows you to play as various different factions during a set time period- whatever era that game has chosen to focus on. Your aim as that faction is to conquer the map and build your empire. Unlike other history strategy games like EU4 or the Civ games, you can fight battles in real time on campaign maps. This is really what set total war apart and is why I fell in love with the games at a young age.
Of the various different time-periods Creative Assembly (the UK-based game developer) has done over the years the Ancient-Roman/Greek games have always been of particular interest to me. The idea of testudos, phalanxes and war elephants appealed to me in a way that things that came before such as Stone/Bronze Age warfare and periods that came after like the Medieval era could never fully equate to.
Needing to relax in my free time, as I am currently preparing for my COMPTIA Security + exam, I decided to play Rome Total War 2. However, the vanilla version of the game is a bit too normal and to spice things up you really have to be playing the DEI mod. If you were to sum up the DEI mod in one word it would be immersion. Multitudes of carefully researched new units, game mechanics and options have been added to the game.
All I needed to do now was pick a faction. Having recently done a Roman run and given that I’ve been reading and watching videos on the Punic war I wanted to give the Carthaginian Empire a good go. My aim would be to do what Hanno, Hannibal and Hasdrubal couldn’t. Conquer Italy.
Like in real life, in 272 BC Carthage has a tricky start. As a maritime focused, trading empire, stretched across the western Mediterranean, you find yourself facing threats from multiple directions. Your Spanish holdings are open to attack from savage tribes across the Iberian Peninsula, desert tribes to your south are ready to strike when they sense you are at your weakest and your holdings on the Island of Sicily are also under threat from the Greek city-state of Syracuse. And this is of course all before you come to the main emerging threat to your empire…the Romans!!!
No mean feat to be able to deal with such an array of threats. But wait there’s more. To make matters worse and in-accordance with historical accuracy, your land forces leave a lot to be desired. Carthage, as is the way with many trading empires, relied heavily upon their wealth to get mercenaries to fight their battles for them and only had a small core of their citizens as soldiers. The mercenary-centric nature of your armies could not be more strongly contrasted with the state-funded and citizen-staffed legions of Rome. Yet, there are some slightly redeeming features such as having superb cavalry, like Numidian and Iberian horsemen, and an array of aggressive light infantry mercenaries, which you can get from Gaul and Iberia. Whereas Rome goes for standardisation, to play to your strengths you should rely on the variety of mercenaries you can choose from.
With this all in mind, I devised a clear strategy. I would focus, as Carthage did in real life following their defeats in the 1st Punic War, on expanding my already existing Spanish holdings. I wanted to be able farm their resources and set up mines in order to fill my coffers for my future war against Rome. In essence it was a race against time- could I add Spain to my Empire before Rome came south and attacked me? In order to fulfil this strategy, I would have to leave other fronts less defended and accepted that some territorial losses like in Sicily or Africa would occur as a consequence of focusing on Spain.
Things kicked off to a terrible start. Whilst recruiting armies in Nova Carthago (SE Spain) to begin my bloody conquest of the Iberian Peninusla, Syrcause decided to launch a surpise attack on my Sicilian cities. They swiftly took my cities and liberated them to a Greek vassal of theirs. This was all part of the plan… I expected this to happen I reassured myself.
All was not lost, however, for two reasons. Firstly, through the use of trade and diplomacy I was able to prevent the desert tribes from attacking me to the south and I had secured my eastern border by establishing friendly relations with the Ptolemies in Egypt. Also by implementing a policy of Divide et Impera (see what I did there) I was now picking off one Spanish tribe at a time. Even better Rome had become mired in an attritional war against Epirus and then subsequently wars against raiding Thracian and Illyrian tribes. Again all I needed was time, even if they won those wars I would be strong enough to handle Rome on my own…if I conquered Iberia.
However, whilst I was getting closer to completing this goal, with my various armies subduing and annexing one tribe after another- disaster struck again. One of the Carthaginian noble houses revolted against my rule (the Barcid Family) and launched a revolt in my western African possessions . This threatened to stall my Spanish foray grievously. Luckily through the extra funds I was now receiving, I raised extra armies to speed up my conquest of Spain and through the use of my Numidian vassals I was able to simultaneously conquer Iberia and stave off the threat from the fifth column.
I was therefore ready to invade Sicily and take back what had once been Carthaginian. The invasion was swift and decisive. The Greek field armies, weakened by their own failed invasions, were swept aside by my invasion force. The siege of Syracuse was tough and bloody and after a desperate sally attempt by the defending forces; the city eventually fell.
Rome, seeing that I had taken all of Sicily for myself, declared open war against me. I knew I had to act fast, raising another army in Carthage and bringing my last army in Spain over to Sicily I was ready to invade Italy proper itself. My forces were able to overcome the two Roman legions defending their southern most province, Consentia.
Following this, Rome attempted to field 3 legions against my main force, however with fresh reinforcements coming in from Carthage and Iberia, I was now able to threaten multiple cities on the Italian mainland. After a great battle near Beneventum, I had crushed the last significant Roman force on the Italian Peninsula. It was a brutal engagement, which was won by my Iberian cavalry delivering a rear charge to their infantry and shattering their centre. After I secured my foothold in Magna Graecia, I finally marched on Rome. Following a direct assault on their city walls, the garrison of Rome was overcome and the city fell into Carthaginian hands. Rome was a broken power all that was left was to mop up the remaining strongholds it held on Italy.
So what are my reflections on playing as Carthage? Tough to be sure, particularly with the mod I was using. Fun?- Definitely, the initial position Carthage finds itself in requires planning and strategic foresight from the player. Although there were certain things the game cannot accurately represent and a couple of things which were a bit unrealistic, playing as Carthage is certainly something I would recommend to any person considering checking out the DEI mod. It is probably not as fun as Rome, the mod is built around playing as Rome, but as my Carthaginian campaign shows, you can still have a whole lot of fun roleplaying an alt-historical scenario such as winning as Carthage during the Punic Wars. These what-if scenarios have always fascinated us amateur military historians because we get to relive the strategic decisions that generals went through and it is exciting in itself to see how a different military strategy could have enabled a losing side to win and changed the course of history.

The professor showed us a photo of an insect.
“What is that?” he asked us.
A cricket.
“What would you think if you saw it on your bed?”
Get it off my bed.
But would I think the same way if I grew up in another part of the world?
Crickets.
Stepping on a plane to Rome, I did not expect that a metaphorical cricket would be one of the most important things I took with me on the plane back. But, here we are.
I recently spent two weeks in Rome, Italy, taking an international business class through Marquette University’s summer study abroad program.
We spent much of our time learning about how to do business in a global market and how to understand cultural differences. We also toured businesses in Rome and saw how global companies operate. We spent time exploring Rome and of course, eating a lot of gelato.
I had never been abroad. I had never even taken a business class. But this program expanded my view of both in new ways.
They say when in Rome, do as the Romans do. When I was in Rome, I saw firsthand how we all do as our culture tells us to do. But I also learned how to bridge those divides.
I have taken international advertising and public relations classes so I had some knowledge about global business before I went. I knew about high context and low context cultures. I knew about the importance of a power index to some cultures. I thought I understood it — but being abroad changed my perception on culture.
We are all told to live by the golden rule: treat others as you want to be treated. This doesn’t apply in other cultures. Here’s why.
Professor Kevin MacGabhann from the Strasbourg Business School in France was the professor who pulled up a photo of a cricket. He eventually explained.
In America, we see crickets as pests.
In Thailand, crickets are a popular snack.
In China, crickets are pets.
We might find customs strange if we’re not used to them. But once we learn more, we can understand it.
Most people understand that cultures build bonds and also create differences among groups of people. We can then begin to understand those differences as we learn more.
Professor MacGabhann showed us that understanding is only the first step. We need to recognize these differences in ourselves. We might find it abnormal that people eat crickets, but they might find it abnormal that we kill them.
Cultural differences are two-sided; we need to recognize the differences in both directions.
After we recognize our own cultural differences, we can begin to adapt. This is the most crucial step. Treat others as they want to be treated.
Treat others as THEY want to be treated.
When we are among different cultures, we need to adapt to their culture. Without doing that, we will run into tension and problems. That does not mean we need to go out and buy a cricket to keep in our room or eat one with dinner. It means if we are in Thailand, China, or somewhere else, we shouldn’t step on a cricket.
And maybe you are already adapting — you can get a cricket lollipop in Waukesha or a grasshopper taco at Belair Cantina not too far from campus.
In the context I learned them, these points were geared toward international business relations. However, they do not stop there.
I think that this point is so important no matter where we are. There are different cultures within schools, neighborhoods, work environments. We need to understand, recognize, and adapt whether we are in the Marquette bubble or across the world in Rome.
We need to understand, recognize, and adapt whether we are in the Marquette bubble or across the world in Rome.
I know that now I am going to look at my everyday life differently. I will pay more attention to the cultures surrounding me and do my best to learn and adapt.
I want to travel abroad again. I want to find new cultures and learn about them and try to adapt to them. But I do not have to go far to do that. I will start where I am and hopefully that will lead me across borders again.
Because abroad or not, I want to remember to do as the Romans do. Treat them how they want to be treated.

The Vestal Virgins inhabited a unique space in Roman society. They were the most prominent women in Rome, heavily revered and with privileges no other woman was given. But they also lived with extreme duties and restrictions. Their most famous restriction is obvious from their title: every Vestal was unmarried and pledged to remain a virgin through her thirty-year term of service. And a Vestal who broke her oath of chastity was buried alive.
But how often was this extreme measure used? And when it was, what did it look like? I have been researching Vestals for a few years as I work on a historical fiction novel centered around one (coming soon, I hope), and I’ve had to get into the nitty gritty details. Here’s what we know about the ultimate punishment for Rome’s most sacred virgins.
Before we bury one alive, let’s make sure we know who the Vestals were.
People ignore Vesta, but she’s one of my favorite goddesses, and was one of the Romans’ favorites too. Her duty doesn’t sound like a big deal today — goddess of the hearth, the fireplace. Modern people tend to think, “why have a goddess for that?” But for the ancients, the fireplace wasn’t just something to get cozy by to drink hot chocolate. It was the source of fire for the house, meaning the light for their lamps and the heat that cooked their food. Without Vesta’s flame, a house was vulnerable and unlivable. Vesta made a house into a home.
Sure Vesta isn’t as splashy as some other deities — she’s a virgin goddess so she doesn’t have relationship drama, and she’s a guardian of the home so she doesn’t leave to have adventures. But to the ancients she was steadfast and ever-present, a goddess without whom life would have been impossible.
Vesta’s private role as protector and life giver to the household was reflected in her public worship. There was a shrine to Vesta in the Forum Romanum¹ tended by the Vestal Virgins, who kept her sacred flame burning. Just as a house must have a hearth to make it a home, Rome was not Rome if the eternal flame was not burning — the flame represented the safety of Rome, and the favor of the gods that allowed Rome to hold its vast conquered empire. It took 24-hour maintenance to keep the sacred flame from going out. The Vestals also prepared the sacred grain/salt mixture that was sprinkled on the head of every sacrificial animal, so in a real way, Roman religion would have been nothing without them.
This legal status of the Vestals was unlike any other woman’s in Rome. For the ancient Romans, one of the essential characteristics of a woman was male control: she belonged to either her father or her husband. Widows with no living father had to pass into the legal control of a living male relative.² Unfortunately, the notion of women belonging to men is not strange to us. But male control of women was much more deeply entrenched in the Roman legal code than it ever has been in ours, and freeing the Vestals from that control put them into a shadow category, a zone that was neither masculine nor feminine. They could make wills and testify in court, which other women could not because they weren’t considered autonomous. They were also sacrosanct — it was illegal for men to touch them — and bizarrely sacred — if a Vestal accidentally met a man on his way to execution, his life would be spared.
After their thirty years were up, Vestals could do as they wished. Many chose to marry (and apparently men really loved marrying former Vestals, which seems like a lot we could unpack but I’m choosing not to). But many chose to continue their legal limbo — if she married, the former Vestal rejoined Roman society as a wife, reentered male control in the household of her new husband. An unmarried former Vestal was still a woman apart, the only truly autonomous woman in ancient Rome.
In short, Vestals were separate from Roman society, even as they lived in the middle of it. They were separated legally, and they were separated from close contact. They were not Romans really, but something else… they were representatives of all Romans, and of Rome itself.

But I promised I’d tell you what happened when a Vestal Virgin was convicted of violating her oath of chastity. For a Vestal, having sex was a betrayal of her promise to Vesta, an act which would put the safety of Rome in jeopardy. The virginity of average Roman girls and women was controlled in similar (though not identical) ways as in many societies today, but that’s not really what was going on with the Vestals. A Vestal’s purity was supposed to be a requirement for the proper public worship of Vesta, and Vesta’s worship guaranteed the safety of Rome. So an “improper” Vestal would lead to a loss of favor with Vesta for all of Rome — big trouble.
The accusation of inchastity could come in a few forms. It might come from a man — from someone who had heard of an affair, or maybe (though less likely for reasons that will soon be obvious) from the man who’d had sex with her himself, in a moment of repentance.
But, since a Vestal having sex was supposed to be an affront to the gods, the accusation might also come in the form of prodigies. Prodigies were messages from the gods in the form of unexplainable and supernatural events — calves born with two heads, lightning striking prominent monuments, etc. Two examples that stick in my mind are a soldier’s shield falling from the sky and a fully intact human head being found in the ground when digging a foundation. Prodigies sent the Romans to their priests, who would interpret the message and tell the citizens what action the gods required from them.
Some prodigies were good, but many (perhaps even most) threatened doom unless the gods were appeased. And sometimes the omens pointed a finger at the Vestal Virgins, and one or more of them would be accused of violating their oaths without any earthly evidence.
After the accusation, a trial. This was not the same as the trial of a citizen: it was a religious trial with the Pontifex Maximus as judge and the Pontifical College as jury.³ The priests would vote to convict or acquit. If they convicted her, the Vestal would be executed.
The doomed Vestal was carried, gagged, through the streets in a litter that had its coverings fastened down with cords; she could be neither seen nor heard. Crowds followed the litter, but it was apparently a solemn and silent occasion. She was brought to a tomb buried under a ridge of earth near the Colline Gate, on the north side of the city. Paradoxically, the tomb of disgraced Vestals was the only tomb allowed to be inside the city walls.
The tomb was stocked with provisions: bread, water, milk, oil, a lamp, and a bed, as if the Vestal was expected to go on living inside. Her litter was unbound and she was led, heavily veiled, to the steps to her tomb. Then the Pontifex Maximus said a prayer, and all the pontifices would avert their eyes as the Vestal went down, to avoid witnessing the moment of shame.
The tomb was buried, and the Vestal was left to die down there, no grave marker to commemorate her improper death.
The Vestal’s lover would then be subjected to a public flogging. Whipping was a common punishment — the pain was part of the point, but it was more about the public shaming. These floggings could leave the man alive, or they could be carried to the point of his death. Or, if her lover saw all this coming, he might just flee into self-imposed exile.
It was common for upper-class men in Rome to escape into exile if they knew they were about to receive a punishment that would either a) permanently mar their reputation or b) kill them. Rome tolerated this sort of thing and made no effort to hunt down the fugitives — a man who saw a trial turning against him would often leave town at night and face no consequence other than his loss of status. In the eyes of the ancient nobility, that loss of status was punishment enough… but when you put it on a scale next to “buried alive,” yeah, not so much. It was very possible for a man to escape with his life if he were accused of sleeping with a Vestal, and very difficult for the Vestal herself to do the same.

The live burial of a Vestal was, importantly, bloodless. The Romans didn’t kill the Vestal — they put her in a room with the essentials of life to sustain her, and she died without their intervention. (Yes, I am aware they buried her in there; this is ritual, not logic.) It also offered the convenient out that the goddess could, if she so chose, save her priestess and prove her innocence. (I’m not sure if this was something the ancient Romans thought or just a modern supposition.)
The burial can also be meaningfully thought of as a human sacrifice. The gods were upset, and the Romans were offering up one of their holiest priestesses to soothe them. Human sacrifice was unthinkable to the Romans of classical times, but many of their religious rituals had much older roots in prehistory. Meanings got twisted and lost. The Vestal Virgin might originally have been a scapegoat, which would explain why she was kept so carefully between categories: she was no one’s wife and no one’s daughter, so she had no family to demand retribution for her death.
This quality of being outside categorization, and thus available as a sacrifice, might also explain why the Vestals had to be virgins in the first place. In a society in which a woman’s identity was totally dependent on her relationships with men, the sacred virgin stood apart. When they worshipped Vesta, the Vestals acted for the entire city: they could not represent the daughters, wives, or mothers of Rome (as other priestesses did); they had to be blank slates, to represent all Rome. Virginity meant lack of connections.
In short, a properly chaste Vestal was Rome itself. For the Romans, her purity was the safety of Rome, and when she lost it — when she slipped out of her symbolic role and back into worldly society by coming under the sexual “control” of a man — she had to forfeit her life as a sort of sacrifice to appease the gods. This she did in a method devoid of the kind of violence that would have sullied her further.
The immurement of a Vestal was a very rare occurrence. We only know of a few instances in all of Roman history.
Most of the Vestals who went on trial in the historical record were acquitted, not executed. In early history, we get the story of two Vestals who miraculously saved themselves from accusations of wrongdoing. When Vesta’s flame went out (usually interpreted as a sign of Vestal wrongdoing), the Vestal Aemilia threw her sash on it and it miraculously roared back to life, saving her. And a Vestal named Tuccia in the 3rd century BCE cleared her name by carrying water across the city in a sieve without spilling a drop. Vestals, as holy women, were supposed to be able to work miracles. Continuing to work miracles proved the continuing favor of Vesta, meaning they must still be virgins. (How or if these magic tricks fit into the formalized trial structure, I’ll never know.)
In 114 BCE came a bizarre prodigy: the young daughter of a prominent Equestrian was struck by lightning while riding her horse, and was found dead with her tongue sticking out and her dress hiked to her waist. Officials interpreted this as a sign of a scandal between an Equestrian and a Vestal Virgin. (Obvious, right?)
Three Vestals were accused: they said that Aemilia (not to be confused with the earlier miracle-worker) had become corrupt herself and then led the other two, Marcia and Licinia, into vice with her. Aemilia was convicted by the Pontifical College and executed, but the other two were acquitted.
What followed was outrage. The Roman people were convinced that there was a conspiracy of priests covering up the widespread corruption of the Vestal Virgins, and that the other two Vestals were also guilty. So in 113, a Tribune held another trial for the other two Vestals, moving it out of the Pontifical College and into the traditional court system. This trial resulted in a guilty verdict, and Marcia and Licinia were also executed.⁴
Emperor Domitian executed four Vestal Virgins starting in 87 CE. This was part of a push toward cracking down on public morality: like many reformers before and after, Domitian believed that people’s morals weren’t what they used to be, and that he could bring back the good old ways by punishing people for acting wrong. (Yeesh.) Domitian was also notoriously hostile toward the senate,⁵ and since the Vestals were the daughters of senatorial houses, killing them was a way to show the nobility who was boss. Since the emperor was always Pontifex Maximus, Domitian ran the trials and had no trouble securing convictions.
The first three convicted Vestals were actually not buried alive. Domitian allowed them to choose their method of execution. Only for the last, the Chief Vestal Cornelia in 91, did he insist on the ancient punishment. Which makes for an interesting point: we don’t know if the Vestal executions I described earlier were by burial. As far as I can tell, Cornelia is the only verifiable instance we have of a Vestal being buried alive. We know that the Romans considered this the ancient, traditional punishment, but we don’t know of anyone else it happened to.
Cornelia used the big public spectacle of her immurement as a platform. She announced to the crowd before the descended the steps: “Caesar thinks me unchaste, me who performed the sacraments under which he won, he triumphed?” Because, of course, a successful Domitian meant the favor of Vesta; if the empire was doing well, then surely that meant Cornelia was actually innocent.
On her way down, Cornelia stumbled, and the soldier accompanying her put out a hand automatically to help her. But Cornelia kept her balance without him and shied away from his touch — a sign to those watching (according to Pliny the Younger who recorded the incident) that this Vestal was so chaste she would not even accept the sacrilege of a man’s touch on the way to her execution.
And that’s about it for historical examples. There are vague insinuations of other Vestal executions, and concrete details of many other trials that resulted in acquittals, but we only have that handful of confirmed Vestal deaths, only one of them definitely by live burial. So though this sensational and very public punishment cast a long shadow over the lives of thousands upon thousands of Vestals who would never experience it, actual instances were vanishingly rare.
Which leaves us with two possibilities:
I’m inclined toward option 1 — probably there were instances of option 2, but the Rome I know was sincere enough in its religious beliefs that I have a hard time believing they were all openly flaunting tradition but not writing about it. I also think that the Roman men who wrote the histories had a hard time believing in a group of women who are uninterested in sex, and felt it necessary to imply that there had to be something going on there (when really, the something was worshipping Vesta). But historically, of course, it’s unknowable.
The Vestals were women who lived outside Roman society even in its very heart. From them we can learn much about Roman religion and Roman womanhood — and we can glimpse the sinister reasons for the policing of their virginities. The Romans held the Vestals up high when they were shining examples of Rome’s piety, and struck them down as low as they could when they became evidence of Rome’s corruption. The Vestal Virgins may have been the six most important women in all of Rome.
¹We usually call it the Temple of Vesta, but a Roman temple had to be planned out by augury (which Vesta’s wasn’t) and traditionally contained a statue of the deity (which Vesta’s didn’t). It was also rather small.
²In actual practice, such widows were usually fairly independent. But the fact remains that there was a legal requirement that they be in a man’s control.
³The Vestals were part of the Pontifical College, so the Vestals who had not been accused would have voted on the guilt or innocence of their colleague. Roman juries did not have the same ideas around impartiality as ours — in fact, it was considered an advantage if members of the jury to know the accused well, since their opinion of their character had weight in the case!
⁴This was a big move, the imposition of the civil government into what was supposed to be a religious matter. The boundaries between state and religion were a lot more porous than they (ideally) are today, but still — it was an insult to the priests, whom the politicians accused of not being able to handle their duties.
⁵There’s a probably-untrue anecdote in Cassius Dio in which Domitian invited senators to dinner and had gravestones for each of them made to put in their seats.

January 2, 2022|Italy
Today was a quiet day. We said goodbye to granny’s apartment in Assisi and boarded the train to Rome, our final stop in Italy.
The train trip from Assisi to Rome is not nearly as picturesque as the trip from Florence to Assisi. Fewer vineyards, fewer olive groves, fewer castles, no snow-capped peaks in the distance. We did see a few notable sites, however. In particular, we passed by Trevi (the town, not the fountain) which is one of those classic medieval towns where the church is on the peak of a hill and the rest of the town seems to tumble down the hillside.
We also passed by some random towers and fortifications that don’t seem to be guarding anything more interesting than a parking lot and a smattering of houses these days.
As we approached Rome, the surroundings, unsurprisingly, got more industrial and grittier. We passed by nondescript apartment blocks and graffiti that could have been in almost any city in the world.
We arrived a Termini station and seemed to walk for a mile to get to the exit. Then we hopped into a cab which proceeded to gouge us unconscionably. I’m too irritated to go into detail but it…

TLDR; I describe only this first stop of a recent 2-week trip to Italy — partly because of the initial strong and quintessential impressions I formed in this my first-time trip to Italy, and partly because the other dozen or so cities I visited which the reader can probably guess mostly echoed and nuanced these impressions.
Disclaimer: this is not meant to be fully representative of what you should expect when travelling in Rome. In fact it is probably a quite biased series of observations privy to my own meanderings, but I must say these feel very genuine and idiosyncratic of the city. All photos are unedited originals, and no AI was employed in the writing of this article. So Italians, feel free to bawl me out in the comments!
I am not an untraveled citizen of the world — — I’ve lived and toured all over Russia and China for years, for example — yet there are hundreds of countries I’ve never been to. Italy, for example! I realize this may be the exception to the rule for most Americans who can afford to cross oceans for travel, as Europe is a ready destination, whether to enjoy a summer out of school or participate in an exchange program because the cultural and linguistic barriers are lower than for Asia or Africa, for example.
Yet, I did not take preparation for this trip lightly. As I had done in my previous travels, I prepared as much as I could for the language, as I feel it is best to try to speak the local tongue not only out of respect for the people but also to enrich your own experience. Before traveling to Russia and China, for example, I had become fluent in those languages by my tried and true method. But for those I had a few years to spend, whereas this time I had just a few weeks. After skimming a long treatise on Italian grammar, I decided it was hopeless to memorize all the rules. I figured I would be best served in this time frame getting the gist of pronunciation and some basic phrases: what seemed to work well was opening up Google Street View to random locations in Italy, trying to guess the meaning of any signs or writing (graffiti included!) and speaking into Google Translate to check my pronunciation. Sometimes I was way off, but this made it fun! I also got some ‘street smarts’ of what to expect in random city locations. (Later on I had fun actually doing this live when traveling through city streets:
)
More formally, I transcribed Youtube videos (with captions to check my work) to polish listening comprehension. This is so much better than the old days of transcribing radio, and there’s a semi-infinite supply of great captioned videos out there. It’s nice that the graph shows, umm, statistically detectable progress over time!
I was still, however, pathetically prepared for the language. Luckily it is a Romance Language and thus not too far from English and Spanish, of which I know a little, so I could in principle struggle by. BUT, most importantly, essentially everyone we met in Rome spoke English! And when English didn’t pass the bar, they spoke Chinese! No joke, there is a sizable Chinese population in Rome running hotels, restaurants, taxis, and small shops, and I could converse with them absolutely fine!
Now the reader can imagine the usual hassle of international travel culminating in a teleportation to another reality outside the Fiumicino Airport. It looked not too dissimilar from JFK, to be honest. A Chinese driver picked us up, and we grilled him on all the ins and outs of living in Italy what with driving, shopping, eating, avoiding pick-pockets, etc. (he in fact spoke absolutely no Italian despite living there 14 years … that just shows you how strong the Chinese community is there!).
And I now transition to a series of disconnected, but in my view very profound, observations during my travel in Rome. What you will not see is any canned, touristy photos of say, the Colosseum.
Ah well, you’ll forgive me that one.
Every city has history, but in Rome it stares you in the face at every street corner. I mean, you’re walking along the street minding your own business and then the Pantheon is just there in front of you!
And plenty of modern shops and restaurants surrounding it from which to enjoy the view! (NB: these are usually not the better, more authentic restaurants).
Now this one really gets me, I mean is it just improbable or does this kind of thing happen every day: I’m walking through the park next to the Roman Forum, in the baking sun with my sandals feeling very historic and all, on a wide, dusty dirt path that must be trodden daily by thousands of tourists, and look down to pick up a dirty penny. I’m joking to myself, naw, could it be? Rubbing off the dirt, it is indeed no ordinary penny: it looks ancient! Well after some Google Image search it looks quite possibly to be not thousands of years old, but at least 200–300 years (a Vatican copper Quattrino from 1745?). Could also be a forgery to dupe stupid tourists like me, but I’ve been shown plenty of forgeries in my travels and they generally look good, with letters clearly visible and such, whereas this one looks a little too worn and bent by thousands of people stepping on it to make the trick worth it (probably about $10 by my reckoning based on eBay offers for ones in much better condition). Not a treasure exactly, and in its current foot-abused state of negligible archeological value (else I would have, ahem, turned it in to the authorities) but to grasp history serendipitously, and why me? Why now? This just made my day!
There’s no way I can do justice to the sheer volume of Classical Art in Rome, so I won’t even try. The Capitoline Museum, Borghese, countless cathedrals, … you will be overwhelmed by it, eyes and soul beaten to pure submission so you can barely issue a yelp of protest at the beauty in which you’re drowning. I will only say that on my first day in Rome I waited 2 hours in line to get into the Vatican Museum, and I have absolutely no regrets. Seeing this was an absolute “Aha!” moment for me:
And sorry, no pictures of the Sistine Chapel (it’s forbidden) to which this mere hallway led — — when you emerge into it you simply gawk in awe upwards at Adam touching the hand of God and the surrounding universe of imagery and forget where you came from.
Hidden Gems
Walking through the streets of Rome is like no other city I’ve been in. I mean New York is fast and vibrant, San Francisco friendly and upbeat, but Rome surprises you in a very peaceful, contemplative way. Like casually looking to your right, you see an alleyway entrance to an apartment building, and there’s a classical statue at the end in a little garden. Very nice!
Now this building across the street is most interesting, and the guard looks rightly serious about his job:
My usual gripe on the shortage of public restrooms in modern cities applies, but if you’re thirsty there’s a very nice thing in Rome: public fountains!
It has admittedly been decades since I dared drink from a public water fountain in the U.S., where the stale metallic quality in e.g. Central Park is like from a gym locker, but the water out of those Roman fountains is definitely decent! (after observing many others drinking first, of course).
I have to say I was not impressed with many of my compatriots (surmised by their accents) along the way — — one family accused us of ‘cutting the line’ at the Colosseum, which was patently false, and quite publicly made a ridiculous holier-than-thou scene of it. At restaurants there was almost always a very loud table of Americans with the worst language I have heard outside a drunken frat party. And at the Pantheon one very American-looking woman marched right up to the guard well after closing time and demanded “I want to go in there!” If the patience of the Romans hasn’t caved in by now, it must only be due to the compensating dollars rolling in, but that makes me a bit ashamed.
All I will say is I had pizza every day and never got sick of it! And that was of course just 1% of what we enjoyed …

Ultimate Guide to the Best Places to Run in the World's Major Cities and Destinations. www.greatruns.com @greatruns by Mark Lowenstein

Rome is one of the world’s great cities to visit. Filled with antiquities, wonderful historic sites, lovely old neighborhoods and great restaurants, it’s also a fantastic walking city. The running scene has been improving. Yes, there are busy, traffic-choked roads, tangled lanes difficult to navigate, and the air quality can be poor in the summer — but there are great places to run within proximity to where most travelers stay. Highlights of Rome running include a nearly 9-mile “Rome Sights” tour, including some of the principal landmarks and historic sites (go early or on Sundays!). Running along the Tiber River can be a pleasure, especially since a bike path along part of it was put in a few years ago. Rome’s three largest parks - Borghese, Ada, and Pamphili are also terrific for running. And running on the historic Via Appia Antica and the Parco de Caffarella is one of the most unique runs in the world.
Running in Rome will undoubtedly incorporate some of its famous “seven hills” east of the Tiber, as well as Vatican Hill and Janiculum northwest of the river. In terms of public transport, there is are two metro lines, which go round rather than through the historic city. There’s an extensive bus system.
Rome’s weather is Mediterranean. Summers are hot and dry and can be uncomfortable for running. Spring and fall is almost perfect for running. Winters are mild to cool but rarely cold, with moderate rain. Snow and freezing temperatures are rare.
8.6 miles,with options. Start: near St. Peter’s Square or any point. MAP
This is an attempt to put together a tour of some of Rome’s principal sights. Best to do it early before the streets get crowded and to beat the heat. See this as a ‘city tour’, and take your time! The map starts at Ospedale Santo Spirito, right near St. Peter’s Square, or at any point convenient to where you’re staying. The route follows the outskirts of St. Peter’s and Vatican City (without going into it). Then, just off Via Crescenzio is Castel St. Angelo. Cross the Ponte Cavour, over to the Spanish Steps and the Piazza de Spagna. Then, over to the Trevi Fountain and the Piazza Venezia & Piazza St. Marco. Skirt the Capitoline and the Roman Forum by running along Via dei Fori Imperiali to do a tour of the Coloseum, and then through the Circus Maximus.
Shorter option: take a right out of the Circus Maximus and head over to the famous Ponte Palatino. Cross the bridge and return to St. Peter’s along the river path.,Longer option: takes you through the Trastevere area, near the Passeggiata del Gianicolo, and via Garibaldi back down to the river. Add on even more by going up to Villa Doria Pamphili park.
7 miles ONE-WAY. MAP Start: North: Stado Olimpico. South: Ponte Guglielmo Marconi
Running along the Tiber River in Rome is a great way to go for a run and see the city without dealing with traffic and intersections. Several years ago, the city completed a bike path that runs nearly 7 miles from near Olympic Stadium to Ponte Guglielmo Marconi.
The trail runs through the heart of the most visited sections of the city, but below the roads. It’s a great way to do a dedicated run or to use it as a link to other sites or routes. Note that the path can get flooded fairly easily, often leaving behind a muddy mess. The northern section of the path officially starts south of Olympic Stadium but we start the run at the stadium, since it’s a thrill to see it and do a lap around the track. The southern section concludes at the Ponte Guglielmo Marconi. It is also possible to run on the eastern section of the Tiber.
7 miles Out and Back. Start: Circus Maximus Metro Station. MAP
The Appian Way is one of the earliest and most strategic roads of the Roman Republic. Sections of it remain, and it makes for a one-of-a-kind run. Even the marathon in the 1960 Rome Olympics had a section on this road. On a map, it is called “Via Appia Antica”. The surface is the original stone slab, which can be a challenging surface after a time. However, there is a path alongside for much of the way to ease the run. It is possible to run about six miles south to the perimeter road. The road is generally quiet and is closed to cars on Sundays. Our route starts at the Circus Maximus metro station. A nice option is a loop around the Circus Maximus or use the river path. Viale delle Terme di Caracalla is a good option on the return.
A great option is to combine the Appia with the miles of paths in gorgeous Parco Della Caffarella, where you can combine a run with a visit to the Catacombs. The park is more rural and agricultural in nature, with dirt paths though gorgeous green fields. A very different feel than the busy center city or the more manicured Roman parks such as Villa Ada.
~3 miles. Start: Piazza del Popolo, or Spanish Steps/Porta Pinciana. MAPAdd-Ons: Villa Ada Park, or paths along Tiber River.
At 148 acres, this is the third largest park in Rome. It is centrally located and makes for a great run. It’s possible put together a run of about 3 miles along the paths of the Villa Borghese. Sites include the Villa Borghese Gallery, lovely gardens, Museum of Modern Art, boating lake, and Piazza Napoleone. The paths are wide and gravel, and fairly shaded. Due to its central location, Borghese can be accessed via the Piazza del Popolo or the Spanish Steps/Porta Pinciana, among other options. A nice add-on/combination run is Villa Ada, which is another large park in Rome, less than 2 miles away. Use Via Salaria or Viale Romania. Guided walking tour here.
3 miles of paths. Start: Piazza Bligny. Easily accessed via bus. MAP
At 450 acres, this is Rome’s second largest park. It is more wooded and less finely manicured than Borghese or Pamphili. A private area is under control of the Egyptian embassy. The park has an artificial lake, a public swimming pool, and one can rent canoes, bikes, or horses. In summer there’s the Rome Meets the World Music Festival and numerous other outdoor concerts. For running, there are numerous paths throughout the park, including the perimeter of the fort, totaling ~3 miles. For a longer run, combine with Villa Borghese Park, taking Via Salaria, Via Panama, or Villa Romania to Via Giaocchino Rossini.
~10k of trails in the park. Start: in park,or accessible from St. Peter’s Square or Trastevere area.
Rome’s largest park, Villa Doria Pamphili, contains a stunning, mid- 17th century palace surrounded by garden mazes, jogging trails, fabulous fountains, a superb grotto, and pine lined views of Rome from atop the Janiculum hill. Note that there are not maps inside the park. Your best bet is to run the perimeter paths, which add up to ~10k. There are bathrooms and water fountains near the park entrances.
Good running options to/from the park: From Ponte Sisto, Via Garibaldi, passing through the Trastevere neighborhood and by important landmarks such as the Piazza de Santa Maria, Basilica di Santa Maria, the floodlit Fontana dell’Acqua Paola, and the Garibaldi statue. Mix it up by going through the Passeggiata del Gianicolo monument with the cannon that goes off at noon, or the switchback road, Passeggiata del Gianicolo. This makes for a ~2.5 mile loop, to and from the park.
2–3 miles within site. 2 miles to sea and then along water for 1–2 miles.
Ostia Antica was the harbor city of ancient Rome. It is now a well-preserved archaeological site, about about 18 miles northeast of the city and 2 miles from the Mediterranean. It is a popular tourist destination due to its ancient buildings, frescoes, and mosaics. It’s also easily reachable from Rome via a 1/2 hour train ride and is only a few km from the airport. Ostia Antica makes for a good running option along its ancient roads. The stone surface is similar to the Appian Way, although there is grass/dirt on the side as well. It is about 1.2 miles from one end to the other in the Ostia Antica site (admission required). There are numerous add-on options. There are lovely farm fields on either side of the Antica site. Or, run to the sea, about 2 miles, and then along the water, where there is a separated bike path from Faber Beach to the port, and then a nice jaunt out to the harbor.
Like any major European city frequented by tourists, there is a huge choice of places to stay. Pretty much anywhere you stay in the most visited parts of Rome will provide access to some of the runs in this guide. A few recommendations, for runners.
There are not as many specialty running stores in Rome as in other cities of its size. Each of the major running companies — Adidas, New Balance, Puma, and Nike has a store neat the Villa Borghese. A few of the specialty stores.
Footworks. Centrally located in San Giovanni area. Also close to Villa Ada and Parco Caffarella.
Born to Race. 2.5 miles south of Vila Doria Pamphili
LBM Sport. 1.5 miles north of the Via Appia
Rome has guided tours. And here.
AUR Runs Rome. The American University in Rome has an active club and meets regularly for group runs.
A.S.D. Roma Road Runners Club
Rome Marathon. April. Gorgeous race through the heart of some of Rome’s great sights.
Ostia Half Marathon. The varied course ROUTE is a fast one with some light up-and-down hill stretches. Starting near Palazzo dello Sport, the route runs in Rome, through the entire length of via Cristoforo Colombo then up and down the seafront, 280m each way, to the finish line at the round-about. (La Rotonda).
Rome Appia Run. April.

I don’t know many people who don’t love Italian food.
The pizza. The pasta. And the produce — just ask anyone who has visited an Italian market to describe what they saw there and watch them get all misty-eyed about bitter greens and parmesan. It’s a sight to see — both the markets and people’s reactions to them.
I recently took my fourth trip to Rome. This is a city that grabbed me by the stomach during my first visit in 2008 and has never let go.
It sounds like a cliché but Romans know how to eat and drink very well. It’s what keeps me coming back more than anything else. You can lead this horse to the Colosseum or the Vatican if you must, but I will only drink from the well of Roman food and drink culture.
30,000 steps a day around the city gave me ample time to reflect on how Rome just gets food and drink right. It’s a pleasure here, not a chore. It’s a way of life, not an inconvenience.
And we could learn a thing or two from that.
Start the day in a café, those quintessential third spaces Italy holds so dear.

Hey there, fellow history enthusiasts! Today, I want to take you on a journey through time and explore the forgotten history of one of the most legendary cities in the world – Rome. So grab a drink, sit back, and let's dive right in!
When you think of Rome, you probably envision grand architecture, gladiators, and legendary rulers like Julius Caesar. But did you know that Rome's history stretches far beyond the commonly known spectacular ruins? It's time to unveil some fascinating forgotten secrets!
To start, let's talk about the early beginnings of Rome. It all began as a small village on the banks of the Tiber River in the 8th century B.C. As I'm sure you can imagine, it's come a long way since then!
One of the most significant periods in Roman history was the establishment of the Roman Republic. It was a time of ambitious politicians, mighty generals, and the birth of true democracy. The Romans were all about the law and order, and they did it with style!
Speaking of style, let's not forget about the lesser-known side of Rome – the fashion! Romans were trendsetters of their time, known for their luxurious clothing, intricate jewelry, and even fashionable footwear.
Of course, we can't talk about Rome without mentioning the iconic Colosseum. This incredible structure served as a…

Intro: This is Citations Needed with Nima Shirazi and Adam Johnson.
Nima: Welcome to the Citations Needed live show Beg-a-Thon. Citations Needed is, of course, a podcast on the media, power, PR, and the history of bullshit. As I said, this is one of our periodic Beg-a-Thons, our virtual live show fundraisers. And we’re so glad that you are joining us tonight. Thank you, everyone. I am Nima Shirazi.
Adam: I’m Adam Johnson.
Nima: It’s great to have you all here with us. Of course, you can follow the show on Twitter and Bluesky @citationspod, Facebook Citations Needed, and become a supporter of the show if you’re not already, and this is a Beg-a-Thon, so we obviously would really like you to become a supporter, through Patreon.com/CitationsNeededPodcast. All your support through Patreon is so incredibly appreciated as we are 100% listener funded.
Adam: Yes, and if you become a supporter on Patreon, which, again, is ostensibly the purpose of this Beg-a-Thon, in addition to delightful conversation, edifying everyone, you get access to over 160 News Briefs, show notes and more fun stuff, special episodes, little things we do here and there, live shows, live chats, etc. But most importantly, you get to put your head on the pillow at night and go to sleep knowing that you supported our humble podcast.
Nima: That’s right. And tonight, on Citations Needed, we will be talking about how Elon Musk and his MAGA incel army have appropriated the cultural imagery and aesthetics of Ancient Rome, while obviously neither knowing or understanding anything about the ancient world beyond what maybe they’ve seen in Gladiator or 300.
Adam: To just sort of orient the audience, Trump World, and now increasingly, Elon Musk is effectively the co-vice president, are obsessed with evoking Roman symbols, iconography, to advance a fascist political agenda. I think it’s fair to use the F-word, fascist. We’re going to use that. I know some people dispute that, but I think I don’t really know what else to call it at this point. White nationalist, at the very least. And they present Rome and view Rome, either in meme format or explicitly, there’s even kind of a cottage industry of pseudo-intellectual scholars we can kind of get into as well who pander to these people, YouTubers, etc. They present it as a kind of the platonic ideal of a quote-unquote “Western civilization.” Everyone has their place. There’s a, you know, the kind of Nietzschean values of conquest and domination, how they view the world as being about, you know, rewarding the people with the most merit and the most honor, blah, blah, blah. And we covered this back in 2019 with today’s special guest. And there’s obviously been a lot of that, has gotten charged and heightened lately. And so we wanted to kind of bring her back also, because she has a wonderful book out that I have read. You should definitely read it too. It is excellent.
Nima: It is so good, and we’re going to be promoting it all night. So who are we talking about, Adam? We’re talking about our guest tonight, Dr. Sarah E. bond, Associate Professor in the Classics at the University of Iowa. Hey, Sarah, good to see you. Sarah joins us again after about five and a half years, she was on Episode 82, way back in July of 2019, in the before times, for our show, which was entitled “‘Western Civilization’ and White Supremacy: The Right-Wing Co-option of Antiquity.” So it is amazing to have you back. You, Sarah, are the author, as we said, of the new book Strike: Labor, Unions, and Resistance in the Roman Empire, which is out now from Yale University Press. I’m so excited to get to our conversation with you, Sarah.
But before we do that, we just want to note why we’re doing this tonight, this Beg-a-Thon, this kind of fundraiser that we do periodically. Citations Needed takes a team to make and it takes a ton of work to do each episode. Not many shows do the research that we do at the pace we do it, and since we started the show back in July of 2017, we’ve released well over 200 episodes, more than 160 News Briefs. We’ve welcomed more than 300 guests. We love doing this. We are grateful for each and every listener, every download, every like, every share, tens of thousands of you wonderful people listen to the show every week, and we cannot thank you enough for that. It is amazing. But only a tiny fraction of you actually support the show and our team through Patreon, which is the way that we’re able to keep doing this. And so that is why we are holding this Beg-a-Thon, as we call it, tonight.
Adam: So that was the good cop. I’m gonna do the bad cop. Listen, you mooches. No, I’m just kidding. I’m not gonna neg you, except to say that we are 100% user supported. We get no corporate sponsorships. We get no foundations. I’ll spare you the sanctimonious spiel, but you get the general idea. So if you do listen and you do like it, it actually is very, very helpful if you actually do support it, because, you know, there’s just not a lot of, of the people who listen, just not a high percentage do, and listen consistently. And yes, we have the data, and we’ve geolocated you. We know who you are.
Nima: [Laughs] That’s right. So tonight, we’re asking, if you are able, to please go to our Patreon page. We’ll put the link up there, but it’s very easy to find. It’s Patreon.com/CitationsNeededPodcast. Go help us out there. All right, enough of this garbage. Adam, let’s get to the show.
Adam: Yeah. Let’s get to the show itself. So tonight we are focusing on, again, we are using as a framing device the popularity of our new South African co-president Elon Musk and his minions and his incel army, with Roman iconography and alleged history as a gateway to talk about what is a far richer, more interesting vision of Rome that you’ve written, this excellent book you’ve written, which we’ll get into. So we’re going to start with that hook, and then kind of get into what you wrote about, which is obviously meant to, in some ways, kind of be a counter to that cheesy narrative, which I’m sure we can talk about. So we’re just going to give a little bit of background, Nima.
Nima: Yeah, sure.
Adam: If you want to sort of take over that part, because I know you had the unfortunate task of gathering that background information unfortunately.
Nima: So you know this idea of fascistic elements, neo-Nazis, in the US, namely their collective, now chief avatar, effective President of the United States, Elon Musk, the richest man in the world. They’ve been adopting and co-opting and misunderstanding the aesthetics of Ancient Rome, kind of as a rule, but as a distinct part of their fascistic political project. And one of the most prominent examples of this occurred after Elon Musk himself did a very clear Sieg Heil gesture three times during the inauguration of Donald Trump in January of 2025. Now Musk’s ally, Andrea Stroppa, who lives in Italy and claims to have an advisory role in some of Musk’s companies, posited that’s Musk Sieg Heil was was merely a Roman salute. Stroppa wrote in a now-deleted Tweet, quote, “Roman Empire is back, starting from Roman salute.”
Adam: Now, this was far from the first time that Musk had cited Rome to justify his reactionary ideology and paranoid xenophobia and deeply, deeply unfunny jokes. The guy’s constitutionally incapable of being funny, which is quite a feat. At least Trump’s funny, I guess. Now our guest, Dr. Bond, wrote for the arts news and analysis site Hyperallergic, we’re sorry, we’re going to quote you back at you. It’s one of the ultimate sins of podcasting, but we’re going to do it. Quote,
Musk has a long history of referencing the Roman Empire. His brand of technocratic despotism and its social media iconography has roots in the work of 20th-century European fascists, who were themselves fixated on Ancient Rome. He has long been obsessed with the late Roman Republic dictator Sulla and in December even changed his X avatar to “Kekius Maximus” — a Romanized version of Pepe the Frog dressed in military garb similar to that of Maximus in the film Gladiator (2000). Like Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, the billionaire has frequently expressed admiration for the Roman Empire, posting AI pictures of himself cosplaying as a Roman soldier…
God, that’s sad. You didn’t write that, that’s me, sorry.
…and cooking up theories about why Ancient Rome fell (answer: severe decline in birth rate). He thinks about it every day.
End quote. So let’s begin. I want to sort of bring in Sarah here.
Nima: Yeah, let’s do it.
Adam: We’ve set the table. Before we get into the questions about the actual book you wrote, forgive us, I want you to sort of comment on this piece, what you think superficially people find attractive. I know the elements are kind of obvious, but I want you to kind of dive into why you wrote this piece, why you think it’s important to engage as a historian of Rome with this seemingly popular current on the Nazi, or Nazi-adjacent Right.
Sarah E. Bond: Right, so the piece that I wrote for Hyperallergic, I wrote with Stephanie Wong, who is also a professor of history. She just graduated from Brown. And we write a lot together, because I think that our perspectives are very aligned, and we’re good at writing together, but we had been for years now, because we’ve been, gosh, we’ve been writing and collaborating for six years together, and so we decided that we were going to just collect all the things that he said since about 2020, about Ancient Rome, because I have just a gigantic digital folder of references to Ancient Rome that politicians have made over the years. And many of us who do a lot of reception history, which is just a fancy word for saying how things are repackaged and reused from the ancient world. We had been keeping track of it, and we had written an article together for MSNBC a few years, let’s see, a year and a half ago, on that meme about why people think about the Roman Empire.
And the person that Elon Musk thinks about the most seems to be Sulla, who was a dictator in the middle and early first century BCE. And Sulla eventually does give up power and is not assassinated. He eventually gives it up and retires and hands what’s left of the Republic over to Crassus and Cicero, I’m sorry, Crassus and Pompey, essentially, as the next consoles. But he’s obsessed with Sulla, and that really set off alarm bells in my head, because Sulla wiped out all of his political enemies by the hundreds. And this is something called the proscriptions, and Julius Caesar refuses to do the proscriptions when he becomes dictātor, or dictator, but it is picked back up again as a practice by Octavian Augustus. And so this idea that you can just wipe out all of your enemies and kill them and give people free rein to kill them is something that he’s idealizing, and it seems to be that he’s fixating a lot on. And especially with the purge of the federal government that’s been going on for the past, guys, can you believe that Trump has been president for a month, exactly, almost? It feels like it’s been five years.
Nima: It feels like it’s been 2,000 years.
Sarah E. Bond: It has been four weeks of nonstop layoffs and nonstop purging of the federal government. And I don’t think that’s the same in any way as killing people via the proscriptions, but I do think that Elon Musk likes to make people vulnerable to attack.
Adam: Yeah. Unless you fly a plane. Or rather fly on a plane, I should say.
Sarah E. Bond: I should just say with Elon Musk that we’re talking about aesthetics and idealizing. But I just want to point out something really huge here that was covered by Maya Pontone on Hyperallergic as well, with background from many researchers, myself included, is that Elon Musk has started to give money specifically to archeological projects and projects focused on the ancient world, and that there is a pipeline that is being created from the world of classics into, directly, the world of Elon Musk and this DOGE palace that he’s creating for himself, that we can’t just say that this is a fantasy that he’s playing out, that he gave over $2 million to the Vesuvius Challenge, which decoded a small amount of the papyri from Herculaneum and gave prize money to a young AI engineer named Luke Farritor. And Luke Farritor now works with DOGE and was one of the six engineers that originally went in with Musk a few weeks ago. So it’s not as though we can say, in the world of classics, Oh, we’re just, you know, he idealizes us, but we’re mutually exclusive. We’re in a bubble out here. What can we do about it? It’s like, No, we have people who are taking the money of Musk, the Vesuvius Challenge, as well as, there’s another called the AIRC in Rome, who has also taken money from Musk, and so he’s funding cultural heritage and AI as a way of accessing people that are involved with the ancient world. And you know, it matters who we take money from. It very much matters.
Adam: There’s a risk there, because, again, he did this. He’s obviously done this for years with STEM, where he throws so much money around that your favorite science channel will do these sycophantic reports on him. Science media will do sycophantic reports on him. They’ll get an interview with him and gush over him, even this is, like, sort of post-overt Nazi stuff. And so, yeah, I mean, when you have, again, $400 billion in debt worth, obviously, it’s not totally liquid, but it’s, you know, he could, he could take a loan against it anytime he wants. And, you know, controlling the past is, is because not to be too sort of, you know, I don’t want to be too overly precious–
Nima: You can rage against the machine. It’s okay.
Adam: Well. I mean, you know, He who controls the present controls the past. He who controls the past controls the future. I do think it matters, because then we’re going to be curated. It’s going to be curated, presented in a way that flatters his ideological dispositions.
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, and we’re already seeing that. We have Trump firing the archivist of the United States after she had already deleted and moved around parts of an exhibit that was within the National Archives. And he still fired her. But she had gone in and edited parts of history that were negative, right? And so the presentation of history and the people that are in control of it is what he wants access to, and he wants good press for sure, and he’s trying to buy himself a connection to antiquity in order to conjure legitimacy that we’ve already seen. This is the same MO that Mussolini took to legitimize his power and his rise within fascist Italy.
Adam: He’s basically–
Sarah E. Bond: All you have to do, yeah, you just rebuild the Ara Pacis, right? Rebuild the Res Gestae Divi Augusti, which is exactly what Mussolini does, is invest so many thousands and millions of dollars into the rebuilding of the Roman Forum and the rebuilding of the Roman senate house. This is a playbook we’ve already seen before, because he has no legitimate status within the federal government. So he’s clinging to what he perceives as the only legitimacy that he cares about, which is power from the ancient world.
Nima: Talking about preserving the past and also, you know, as we’re going to get into kind of who is allowed to control our understanding of the past. And we’re going to get into this, this idea of, you know, whether from imperial historians kind of empowered and sponsored to tell the official history of Rome, to this kind of idea of history from below, which you tell through your work, Sarah. I’d love to kind of discuss the overall thesis of your book, which really shows how class conflict and the organized withholding of labor was a consistent feature of Roman life, as were slave revolts, military strikes, other forms of resistance, much of which has been erased or at least reduced to individual stories of heroism in kind of broader ancient, historical retellings, and certainly in the popular mind. How those who don’t study this so closely kind of understand the ancient world, and then certainly Ancient Rome. So what compelled you to write this new book Strike, and what broad image of Rome, both in our pop culture and in kind of more historical consensus, were you attempting to illuminate and edify for us?
Sarah E. Bond: I was going back and re-reading an economic history of Rome from a guy named Tenney Frank, and he was a racist from the turn of the 20th century, like into the 20th century. And, I think it’s 1920, he writes an economic history of Rome, and he thinks that strikes cannot happen because of the number of enslaved people within the Roman Empire. And we do know that within the Italic peninsula, for instance, up to 25% of the population, especially during the the period of the High Roman Empire, so the first two centuries CE, have a large number of enslaved people. And even prior to that, there was a large number. And so he thought that because there were enslaved people, there could never be strikes, because every time you would have artisans going on strike, why wouldn’t you just replace them with other enslaved persons? And that really discounted the professionalization of enslaved people as potters, as weavers, as textile workers, as carpenters, as tavern workers and owners. And his belief that there weren’t strikes kind of infuriated me, and led me to read more about what people thought about strikes, about withholding labor, and what it might have been called in the ancient world.
And it was surprising to me that there just had been so little written on collective action and the withholding of labor in the ancient world, because many people, both Marxists and non-Marxists, had thought that there really weren’t a lot of instances of it. And so in the 19th century, Marx and Engels had believed that the first strikes ever had been the plebeians during what we call the Struggle of the Orders, which really starts in 495 BCE. And if we’re trying to place that, that’s about 15 years after the start of the Roman Republic. So 509, the Roman Republic starts. The last king of Rome is ousted, and we have the start of something we call the res publica, or the republic. And a few years after that, we have the plebeians and the patricians fighting against each other because the patricians are extremely wealthy and they have a lot of power, but also they have a lot of both soft and hard power, in that they monopolize all the magistracies, the consulship, the pontifical colleges, all of the major magistracies, the patricians are, are really dominating.
And so I looked at the Struggle of the Orders, but thought to myself, I think there has to be many more instances of this happening. And so starting to look through things that really didn’t make it into the traditional literary historical record, like papyri and inscriptions, really was the access point to find out that, especially in the Greek world, and going all the way back to the Egyptian world, this had been happening for many thousands of years. And so I started tracing backwards and forwards and finding that there were a lot more instances, because a strike by any other name is still a strike. And so even though the word is not coined until the 18th century in England, because it’s referring to the striking of the top sails of merchant ships in the 18th century, even though that word does not exist in Ancient Rome, that you still have the withholding of labor and the boycotting of certain assigned things like the military levy through calling it a secessio, where we get, for instance, the word secession from. But then when you look in the Greek papyri, they’re calling it an anachoresis, which just means a withdrawal. And for many hundreds and thousands of years, we’ve had workers, especially in Egypt, refusing to work unless they were given emmer and wheat and the right amount of staples to keep working. Sometimes they would just go sit in the back of a temple.
And so for me, it was saying modern people think that strikes are a development of the progressive modern Western civilization post-Industrial Revolution, and as is my wont, I usually like to say to most things, Well, that sounds like bullshit, that that we have created this idea of progressive structure to get to the period that we are now, even though it does not feel that we are in a progressive moment in the least, and to try and unpack why we think that unions and strikes and labor withdrawals, that all of these things are a much more modern development in order to really make us feel a little bit more successful as individuals. And I think we just have to give more credit to the Romans.
Nima: Yeah, I love the idea that, like, a strike by any other name is still a strike that, even if they don’t use that term, because, you know, you actually start your book by talking about how the term was coined, the striking of sails in a British port. But then going back to Deir el-Medina, the strike in Egypt, and then kind of tracing that up through history is just, I think, really, really fascinating to see how, in a world that is built on the on the backs of laborers, the power that is held through withholding labor, has been recognized, not just, you know, since the Industrial Revolution, but you know, for thousands and thousands of years.
Adam: On some level, the idea that people around the world would withhold labor is, it does seem sort of self-evidently obvious, because what other leverage do you have as a laborer? And 99% of humans throughout history have been laborers, typically exploited in any kind of semi-developed sense that would be exploited by some rich asshole who lived on the hill. It doesn’t. It’s not a huge leap to say that this is a kind of universal, that there’s an evolutionary convergence to land on some form of strike, right? And what you argue is that while that is true, there was also more sophisticated antecedents that made these more coordinated, more and more sophisticated than we maybe thought.
And one of the things we talk about is these associations, which were both kind of, which were not these kind of perfect Marxist organizations, in the sense that they were oftentimes kind of business trade groups. They didn’t fit along these kind of perfectly, you know, Maoist lines, but in many ways they what you do argue is that they could be instrumentalized to carry out something we would recognize as a labor strike, and that because of the way history is written, you specifically talk about Levy and others, because of the inherently elite nature of reading and writing and how history is created, the first draft, second draft, third draft, that those stories get flattened or obscured.
And you even have this great section, I won’t read it back to you, because I’d like you to talk about it, about the ways in which mob violence is flattened. When you say that oftentimes, as a class dimension, that is fairly obvious, but in the history books, it’s kind of written off as just mob violence. And you even draw some parallels to current examples, when mass unrest is sort of stripped of its ideology, which I thought was a really fascinating, really interesting part of the book. Can you talk about the ways in which–
Nima: Cicero was just doing what the New York Times does now.
Adam: Well, yeah, by the way, I found out he did, The the shrimp store called and they’re running out of you, The jerk store called, where he would, I didn’t realize this until I read Mary Beard’s book, that he would write what he said on the Senate floor later on, which seems like cheating. And then people presented it as like, He’s this great orator, and it’s like, You just got to go back and rewrite it. Anyway. Talk, if you could, about the these associations, how they provided the kind of framework to make a more sophisticated form of labor unrest, and if you could also talk about the ways in which historians, for obvious reasons, who were wealthy or patrician or what have you, decided to kind of say, Oh, that was just mindless, ideology-free violence.
Sarah E. Bond: I think when we create homogenous groups, when we call everybody a mob, that’s already a pejorative, it’s already casting them into negative rhetoric. And the Romans are no different. They like to use very large, amalgamous nouns, a turba, a multitudo, that is to just say, a gigantic negative word for a crowd, right? And when you just say crowd, you aren’t allowing for organization, you aren’t allowing for hierarchy, you aren’t allowing for structure. And although we don’t get a ton of anatomies of crowds from the ancient world, we can see, especially in the late Republic, that a lot of groups that are coming together, what we call collegia, and that’s where we get the modern word college from. A collegium, in the singular, is just a group of people. In Roman law, you have to be three or more people to be considered a collegium. And we have about 3,200 inscriptions in papyri that give reference to these various groups that really grow in number in the early Hellenistic period forward.
So from the death of Alexander the Great forward, people increasingly are creating groups for various reasons. So you could have a group that is focused on Dionysus, because who doesn’t want to get together and drink some wine and have a nice bacchanalia? But you could also form a group, if you were merchants or trades people living on the island of Delos, and you’re human traffickers, and you need to have a workflow, essentially, that moves people throughout the Mediterranean. You can move bread through it, in terms of wheat and flour, you may need to have a supply chain to give you precious jewels, pepper, cinnamon, lots of things that you might want to trade, or you might just be a carpenter and want to have other carpenters that you work with.
And so these collegia are proliferating, especially into the period of the Republic. Many of them don’t have enough money to meet in a proper schola, which is a clubhouse. And so lots of them do what many confraternities have always done, and that is meet in a public house, called a pub. And so you go to a tavern, the tavern keeper allows you to sit there and to congregate. And when we try and understand the movements within the late Republic, one of the things that I think is important to see is that these groups are coming together extremely quickly, in a very organized manner, in order to hear public speeches called contiones. And so my question is, Okay, we have rhetoricians like Cicero, who’s calling them just a gigantic mob, but in reality, he’s giving us clues that say that they’re starting in a specific sector that artisans are known to live within, and that the tavern keepers are involved in it. And to me, trying to reconstruct the underlying structure is very important, because a lot of that gets erased in the name of marginalizing them. And marginalizing vocabulary is something that we’ve seen, especially since 2020. When you marginalize a crowd, we saw this even with Occupy Wall Street as well, is that, yes, Occupy Wall Street actually was quite organized, even though, yes, they were very against hierarchy and a lot of the traditional leadership structures, but we really see that it’s elite people who tend to call crowds mobs.
So whether it’s Black Lives Matter, whether it’s any other social movement, it deprives them and really robs them of their peaceful protest and of their organization. And I think that this is something that always has happened, is that really wealthy people, if you want to completely marginalize a movement, you just simply call them a mob. And that just is an unjust way to label many groups, not all groups, but I think a lot of groups have been robbed of their legitimacy by being called a mob, because immediately you think of violence and criminality and also anti-patriotism, and that’s something that with unions, for instance, if we go back to Garfield, President Garfield, not the cat. I mean, I like the cat, too.
Adam: No relation.
Sarah E. Bond: No, no relation. President Garfield, he hated unions, and he thought they were unpatriotic, and he thought of them as just individuals who incited mob violence. And so it’s not hard to trace and to track down the ways in which we marginalize groups of people, individually, but also groups that are coming together in order to fight for their rights.
Nima: But it’s not just in rhetoric, right, Sarah? I mean, because also then the discourse and the language and the denigration also turns into policy or legislation, and we see that now, you know, with anti-protest legislation across the country, whether that is, you know, from campus protests against genocide in Palestine or, you know, long before, anti-assembly legislation. But you also talked about this in your book Strike, about how the elites and the wealthy call associations or call, you know, regular people getting together, not only a mob, but then they kind of legislate against it. Talk about where that came from, and some of the parallels there.
Sarah E. Bond: I think we’re all thinking about anti-assembly legislation, especially since October 7, and thinking about groups coming together and protesting against the treatment of Palestinians especially. I visited the groups that were on the quad at the University of Chicago. We had a very small group at the University of Iowa, for instance, and many campuses across the country were. Pushing them off of public property. Now, the University of Chicago is a private school. That’s a little bit different, but we even saw this at public schools that people were getting arrested, that they were not allowed to assemble, even when they were just peaceably in their tents and just sitting there.
So I think that we’ve been thinking about freedom of assembly and whether that is a civil right and to what extent it should be protected. And when we go back to the ancient world, we see that freedom of assembly was something that very wealthy elite people like senators and the emperor were very, very anxious about. And it’s not something that is new, that, especially for instance, Julius Caesar and Octavian moved to make legislation very soon into their periods of rule that say, Okay, well, you know, collegia, maybe they can, they can meet at certain times, but predominantly we’re going to have them disband unless they’re the oldest collegia that have ever been established, and if they have a public utility, right?
And this idea of the civic good that a collegium has to serve the civic good, it’s tying into this idea of patriotism, again, is that freedom of assembly is only extended if it is for the good of the res publica, but when you get into the Empire, the res publica does not really exist anymore. It’s a false reconstruction that Augustus has made, right? He calls it the reconstruction of the res publica, but come on, it’s an empire. It is the empire that he is building, and he is the imperator. And so what he’s really saying when he disbands collegia and when he begins to threaten freedom of assembly more and more, is that I don’t want myself threatened by this, and I don’t want any public discord that might turn into resistance against me.
And the smothering of resistance before it can really ever get a lot of steam is just something that is quite common within the Roman Empire. People think that they’re, Oh, you know, the Roman Empire was so good to live in that there was just no resistance, right? Like after Spartacus, we have, Oh, very little, except for maybe the Jewish Wars that are in Judea. And that’s just not true, because everyday resistance, the act of forming a union, the act of engaging in a labor strike, right, the act of pushing against this revoking of freedom of assembly, everyday resistance, is just as important as these gigantic rebellions. They don’t just formulate out of nothing. And so I think that freedom of assembly has always been revoked and questioned and placed as something unpatriotic, because those in power have always known that when people get together, they have more power collectively than they do apart, and that’s why the motto of the United States is E Pluribus Unum, one out of many. And right now, we’re seeing a shift to just the unum part, but not really the people as much a part of it. So that’s something that is really scary to see Trump tweet out, “LONG LIVE THE KING!” It was something that gave me chills, because I immediately thought of the late Roman Republic.
Adam: So I want to sort of back up here a little bit and sort of maybe circle back with what we talked about with your book, with the sort of more topical themes about the rightwing fascination with Rome. And it’s superficial, albeit superficial, which is, I mean, look. Rome as a sort of idea is the way we sort of perceive the West, right? You know, it wasn’t till the late ’90s that to graduate from Oxford, you had to know Latin. It is, it is the way in which academics and intellectuals and scientists talk to each other, up until, again, whatever, the 1800s. Rome, obviously, is kind of what we what, what is viewed as, as Europe, as a sort of, for want of a better term, white civilization, despite the fact that it, of course, wasn’t one in any meaningful sense. But that’s certainly how it’s been idealized as it’s gone through its various white supremacist historical laundromats throughout the decades. And so it kind of makes sense why people who are kind of adrift, or don’t really have any firm, who aren’t very firmly committed into any kind of ideology, would be drawn to it because of its proximity to, it’s sort of a more politically correct form of white nationalist sort of mythmaking.
And so, in some sense, does it make sense why a sort of mediocre, you know, internet-addled dope like Musk would would, again, superficially be into it. He sort of praised Mike Duncan’s podcast, much to Mike Duncan’s chagrin. It all kind of makes sense, because it is this sort of idealized, white, sort of heroic version of themselves and in a weird way, I know I mentioned her book before, but Mary beard’s book SPQR, at the very end, she has this line that’s clearly in dialogue with that, where she says, I get asked a lot, you know, basically been working on this book for 50 years, I get asked a lot, What do we have to learn from modern society in Rome? And I’m paraphrasing here, forgive me if I’m misrepresenting this. But she kind of says, Basically nothing. And I don’t think she meant that, like in a non-, in a sort of anti-intellectual way. I think she was, it appeared to be in the context it was written to be responding to these people constantly saying we’re at the end of the Roman Empire, because it’s so cliche, right? Isaac Newton said it. I mean, every 10 years we’re, you know, we’re in the end. Everyone likes to talk about the fall of the Roman Empire, because what are you criticizing? Homophobia, right? You sort of, you’re trafficking the idea of, we’re becoming effeminate, we’re becoming weak. Blah, blah, blah, the meme Strong Men Create Good Times, Good Times Create Weak Men.
Sarah E. Bond: A lot of immigration. They really like to harp on immigration.
Nima: That’s right. The barbarians are coming.
Sarah E. Bond: Right. The barbarians at the gates. Yes.
Adam: So if you could, if you would comment a bit about or rather, it’s a little bit open-ended, but I want you to talk about why you think that the mythology, the white supremacist mythology of Rome, appears to be increasing, but has kind of survived and what you think, to what extent do you feel like some, you know, I don’t want you to name names necessarily, but what extent pop history movies have really contributed to that, where they do have this very one-note kind of vision of what, not to sort of blame them for it necessarily, one-note vision of Rome?
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, I did review Gladiator, too. So we just, I mean, I reviewed it for Hyperallergic and I think a lot of the misconceptions about Rome are very entertaining. That when it goes on film, who doesn’t like watching the first Gladiator in the year 2000? And all of the things that are being picked up on and received, right as it’s being filmed at the end of the Clinton administration, is talking about, We can bring Rome back. We can bring the Republic back. Now that’s absolute bullshit, because Marcus Aurelius, in no way ever wants to bring back the Republic. There is no hint of evidence. He had always set Commodus as being the one that was going to be his successor. But this idea that the Republic could come back, that was a romantic idea of the year 2000 that then resurfaces this year with the latest Gladiator, 25 years later, really, 24 years later, coming to the surface, this idea that the Republic could come back. So I think that there are some people who really want to see a genuine resurfacing of proper governance, or some sort of governance that people influence in some way. And so I’m not saying that Gladiator II is completely innocuous, because there are a lot of things wrong with that movie, but they are entertaining. Whether there were sharks in the amphitheater or not, and there were not sharks in the amphitheater, sorry.
Adam: Aw, boo. Sarah! Let me live the lie.
Sarah E. Bond: You could fill the Colosseum with water. It was watertight. So that’s true, you can have a sea battle in the Colosseum, but there were not sharks.
Adam: They got a little greedy with the sharks. They got a little greedy.
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, the CGI was just too far. So there are innocuous things, I think, like sharks in the Colosseum, that I’m really fine with. It’s just that this love affair with the fall of Rome is this idea that, especially conservatives, but we also have liberals who have written horrendously facile op-eds about the fall of Rome as well, that they can be the prognosticators using history. So they’re not only making themselves look extremely cerebral and extremely knowledgeable about quote-unquote, “Western Civ,” they’re also telling the future, and that gives them a level of power within the public sphere, and what they perceive of as the intellectual community, that gives them some sort of currency that they’ve read Gibbon. Well, who hasn’t read Gibbon? There are a lot of people that have read Gibbon. He published a two-volume set in 1776, guys, okay? There are no spoilers here. Everybody kind of knows what Gibbon has said.
But Gibbon is also speaking about the late 18th century. Everybody who is writing history, including myself, is thinking about the time period that they are living in. And I just think that, going back to this idea of the fall of Rome, is not only regurgitating and recycling Gibbon, which it clearly is, but it’s trying to send out a message that I am the truth teller, so please put your trust in me, and that’s essentially what op-eds are supposed to do anyways, right? Like I’m an opinion writer, I have a thousand words, I’m going to sway you that what I’m telling you is significant. It’s just that they get the history so wrong, especially, I would say when it comes to talking about religion and talking about, also, immigration, and talking about what really brought down different component parts of Rome, because Rome doesn’t fall monolithically together as one. That we have fracturing, that we have going in different directions, that many areas like North Africa stay extremely strong up to the Vandal invasion and things like this. So I mean, it’s just this idea that they can read the tea leaves through their historical abilities. And it’s just very wrong.
Adam: Yeah, and I’m going to read here from the Nixon tapes. He was obsessed with this idea. He ranted about it a lot. Quote,
You ever see what happened, you know what happened to the Greeks? Homosexuality destroyed them. Aristotle was a homo, we all know that. So was Socrates… Do you know what happened to the Romans? The last six Roman emperors were fags.
He concludes by saying,
You see, homosexuality, dope, immorality in general, these are the enemies of strong societies. That’s why the communists and the left-wingers are pushing the stuff: they’re trying to destroy us.
To be fair, I do do that. He’s got me there. But this is, again, this is so cliche. This has been done a billion times. The idea that, so much of the Roman, and you know, people would say, generally, corruption is what they’re really kind of referencing. But really it’s this idea of, again, Musk is obsessed with this idea of feminization. Again, he’s into weird kind of Silicon Valley natalist cults. He’s apparently doing some kind of panspermia experiment to half of California right now. I guess he’s on his 13th kid. And so it’s like this, this idea of, again, immigration, lack of white fertility, homosexuality, is like they all, they want to see it in Rome in a way that, of course, is not there, but that, of course, doesn’t really matter.
Nima: Well, I think what’s interesting also is, is, you know, the obsession with the kind of emperor or or even patrician class from some of the wealthiest people on the planet kind of makes sense, right? There’s a corollary there. It’s not just Musk. Also Mark Zuckerberg names his kids after, you know, Roman emperors. There’s a whole thing, weird thing going on. But, Sarah, I’d love for you to talk about how, how it’s not just, you know, the wealthy that kind of see themselves as part of that tradition, and kind of wanting to bring that back, that kind of makes sense, right? Like the people in charge want to be like the people in charge, but it’s for the workers and the people who glom on to this aesthetic as well, who all see themselves as warriors, not as other kinds of workers, right? I mean, we’re seeing farmers in the United States right now gutted by the cuts that have just been made to USAID. You know, hit hardest. You know, American farmers. That is not the kind of imagination that people storming the Capitol, or people excited about, you know, stanning for Musk on Twitter, like, they’re not seeing themselves as the people. They’re seeing themselves as these kind of like delayed warriors with the, you know, with the helmets and the crest and the Gladius by their side. Like, you know, where do you think that kind of comes from and how, how is that shaped by how we understand history, which I think your book starts to really unpack, like, who the people really are, and how we hear their stories, the kind of people’s history, not only of Rome, but of ourselves.
Sarah E. Bond: I think the idea of the American Dream is that we can always pull ourselves up from our bootstraps and be Musk, I mean, to be the richest man in the world. A lot of people imagine that they are capable of that, and we know that a very small number of people are ever able to ascend from poverty into the very wealthy 1%. And Musk isn’t even somebody, I mean, he comes from a family of emerald mine owners in South Africa. Trump comes from money. These are all nepo babies, okay, but this idea of the American Dream is that if you work hard enough, you can ascend. But part of that also is this idea of masculinity that is inextricably linked to Roman soldiers. And so if we go back to January 6 and the storming of the Capitol, there were people with signs where Trump was dressed like Maximus. Maximus, again, is not a historical figure there. It’s not real. Russell Crowe is playing a fictional character. But they are imagining themselves to be the highest order of masculinity. And the visualization of that, the kind of allegory that we have assigned to masculinity is the Roman centurion. And so, you know, just yesterday, I was looking at the new picture of Odysseus that was released for Christopher Nolan’s new version of The Odyssey. I want to see it. I’m going to see it, right? But Matt Damon has a crested helmet on that is very much not exactly what would have been worn in the Trojan War, but it is a crested helmet that is kind of very much emblematic of later soldiers that that are fighting, because the Greek phalanx and Sparta, etc., also is a symbol of masculinity.
And so when you try and question those constructions, people get very upset, because especially white men, tend to idealize both Spartan soldiers and also Roman centurions and soldiers as their everyday lives, like, This is how I should go through life. And these are people that don’t quite realize that if they were transported back to the ancient world, the vast chances are that they would be an enslaved person or a farmer or perhaps an artisan or a potter that’s making ceramics, and many of those also fought as soldiers in the earlier period of The Republic, when we have citizen armies. Enslaved persons usually did not but they were incorporated into the military in other ways. But yeah, I really think that it’s, it’s tied up in aesthetics of masculinity.
And I love that Adam said earlier that this is history laundering instead of money laundering, because that’s just exactly what it is. All of the actual, real colors of history have bled out, right? They’ve faded. They’ve been laundered to death, and now it just doesn’t even look like it actually was. It is a meme, and that’s exactly how memetic things work, is just continue to be recycled until they don’t really resemble the past in any real way. So the book is, in large part, trying to bring back the voices of just regular enslaved peoples, freed people, that is to say people who are manumitted, which is also a large part of the population, and they may not seem as sexy as a centurion, but we have the ability to redefine what sexy is. And I think that merchants who form a collegium and go on strike or sexier to me than a centurion that is running into battle. But yeah, I think there’s many books that are incorporated into this and that have been written and will be written on the reception of Roman history and white supremacy, but I think it all comes down to this feeling that, that this is the ultimate, this is the epitome of what it means to be a man.
Nima: Right. I mean, it’s really interesting that you mentioned, you know, that Russell Crowe is, you know, just an actor. Maximus doesn’t, doesn’t really exist. And in your book, you note that actors actually may have been the first in Ancient Rome to form what could be deemed like a proto-union, right? So, like, again, who is the everyday person, who are the people that are really organizing? Who is afforded the protections? Is it the you know, emperors, or is it the artisans?
Adam: I don’t want to let you go without asking about the viral popularity from 2016, then 2019, then it was huge during COVID, of Marcus Aurelius meditations and like Stoicism as this kind of masculine ideal. Ryan Holiday is kind of a hack writer, wrote a book about it, has a podcast about it.
Sarah E. Bond: We call that Broicism, by the way.
Adam: Broicism, sorry, and this is, apparently, it was, it’s been all the rage, and there was a viral lecture on it that was very sort of rah-rah that went viral during COVID. Again, on some level, one can see I actually read it. It was beyond tedious. But I stuck it out. I definitely don’t meet the the platonic ideal of a Stoic. As those listening to the show may be aware, I sometimes complain. And so I want you, I want to ask a little bit about, again, the sort of cartoon version versus the kind of real version. And it mean, again, these book sales, these podcasts are popular, these TikToks are very popular. This is, this is legitimately popular, and this is the primary entry point into Roman history for a lot of people. So talk, if you could, about the rise of Broicism and how, I don’t know if you, if you engage with this with a lot of undergrads or whatever, and talk about where you see it happen.
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, I want to say, if you’re going to buy a translation of Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations, my professor, whose name is Gregory Hays, I believe, wrote the best translation. So if we’re going to give actual money to anybody for buying Stoicism, and please don’t do those Instagrams that are like Stoicism Every Day, I’m going to send Stoicism and witticisms to your inbox, which half the time they’re fake. They’re fake quotes from Seneca. They’re fake quotes from Cicero. They’re fake quotes from Marcus Aurelius, etc. In any case, translations, who you choose to translate your words are extremely important. So yes, pick your translator carefully, number one. Number two, I think that if we think about technocrats and why this philosophy is extremely alluring to them, we can think about the fact that when you are a Stoic, you have to be happy with your lot in life, and it really behooves technocrats to have coders, to have people that are working within their companies, have a philosophy where they come to work and they’re like, You know, Gosh, darn. I’m just happy to be here. I’m going to be the best coder that I could be, right? And when we read things like Epictetus, then we think, Oh, I will be the best enslaved person that I could possibly be. But let’s face it, when you write the Meditations as Marcus Aurelius, and you say, I’m happy with my lot in life, well, you fucking should be. You are the emperor! You are the emperor! And so Elon Musk adopting Stoicism, which he really is not a Stoic in any stretch of the imagination.
Adam: No, I don’t think Stoics would post 50 tweets a day. Yeah.
Sarah E. Bond: No, no, no. This is not a man that I associate with Stoicism. But many technocrats within the area of the Silicon Valley have begun to glom on to this idea, because it is an opiate of the masses, essentially, as a philosophy. If everybody actually adopted it, then you would have people who aren’t trying to buck the system, that they are not trying to rebel, that they are not trying to modify the system in any way. They are trying individually to work internally on being the best person that they can be, but to reinforce the social hierarchy that already exists. I mean, this is not about transforming the society. It’s about reinforcing the status quo. And right now, the amount of social inequality that we have very much benefits extremely wealthy people. These are just wealthy people that want to maintain their wealth to an even higher degree, and Stoicism is a philosophy that supports their thesis, which is, I am awesome and have a lot of money that I wish to keep. And so they’ve only adopted the philosophy post-thesis.
Nima: And everyone else needs to be cool with that, too.
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, get with it! Come on, guys! This is part of the world that we live in, so just pacify yourself. Go forward and come to the office. Do not stay at home and do not work from home. We want you in an office. We want you doing the tasks that we are asking you to do. And please don’t question it, because questioning leads to disruption, and they don’t want disruption. They simply want to rule. And so yeah, I think Stoicism as a philosophy is very attractive to them and also to people who would like to be wealthy. And as we’ve already kind of talked about, this idea of the American Dream makes people believe that they, too, could be this technocrat in the future. So get with it. But yeah, I don’t think it’s very, I’m much more Epicurean. I know you could probably guess that.
Adam: Yeah. We did a whole episode on the kind of David Goggins, self-help, Tiktok world and again, on some some level, I’m sympathetic, because if there is a drudgery in your job, which, again, I know, I’m sure all of us have here had a drudgery job, you have to hold on to something to sort of make it make sense. But again, there’s a reason why your boss wants you to read Marcus Aurelius, and rather than a union organizer, he’s like, Wait. It’s basically the Mike Rowe sweat pledge. So I want to ask one more question before we go, because we’d be remiss if we didn’t talk about the GOAT, Spartacus, and the Servile Wars and obviously, revolts by enslaved people in general, which, of course, there was quite a few of them. Can we talk a little bit about because again, that would be like the sort of entry point into a discussion about labor that is broadly popular, you know, Kirk Douglas with his shirt off.
Nima: Tony Curtis.
Adam: Sorry, with all due respect to Tony Curtis. Talk about that, the sort of popularity of that narrative, again, it’s reduced to this kind of heroic narrative. But like, where did that, where was that oriented into this broader associations framework, and how people kind of mimic these structures, and what lessons can be drawn from that that are not this kind of cartoon, you know, Marcus Aurelius sitting here telling you how to, you know, how to eat shit and suck it up?
Sarah E. Bond: Well, I think Spartacus as a folk hero does not really gain a lot of steam until around the period of the French Revolution and a little bit before. So in terms of his revival, up until that point, people knew who Spartacus was, of course, he is written about by people like Appian and Plutarch, etc. That we have three Servile Wars. The first one is in Sicily in the end of the second century BCE, then we have another one that formulates out of Sicily a few years later. Spartacus himself is a few decades after that, and he’s not on Sicily. He is breaking out of a gladiatorial school in the area of Southern Italy, and Spartacus is seen by the contemporary sources and the sources that are not long thereafter as a rebel and a rabble-rouser. And of course, they’re not going on strike. They fully want freedom and never to come back to their jobs again. They do not want to return to being gladiators, so they’re not leveraging their labor in any way. They want to go free. And my belief is that they really should have, when they got towards the Alps, to continue going, but they circle back and they come back into the Italic peninsula, and I always want to yell like, Keep going, Spartacus! Keep going! But he’s not a hero in his own day. He may have been with enslaved persons. We don’t have a lot of their narratives or reactions to him, but during the period of the French Revolution, into later political campaigns in the 18th and then 19th and then 20th century, Spartacus gains more and more as a folk hero of freedom and rebellion against tyranny, whether it was in Prussia, where he was extremely popular. He became very popular in France and in the United States, and especially during the Haitian Revolution, where Toussaint Louverture takes the name of Black Spartacus. He’s given that name, but he is seen as, you know, this Haitian revolutionary leading enslaved persons to fight against enslavement within the island of Haiti, right? So all of these things build Spartacus’s hero worship, but the movie in 1960 really is what does it to the highest degree,
Adam: Written by a communist. No shocker there. Written by Dalton Trumbo.
Sarah E. Bond: Exactly. And it’s during the period of the blacklist. You know, they’re blacklisting communists after McCarthyism. That Spartacus is really about fighting against The Man. And I see Spartacus absolutely as the GOAT and a hero that should be celebrated. But we have to also remember that he was working within a gladiatorial troupe, and that gladiatorial troupe lives within the gladiatorial school, and they coordinate together. Spartacus has lieutenants that he works with, but he has a group of people that are very close to him that mobilize in a very planned rebellion in the gladiatorial school. They go to the kitchen, and they grab utensils and knives and break out of the gladiatorial school. And then, as they are moving through Italy, whether to Vesuvius, or whether going north, etc, they are gaining more and more enslaved persons in a very organized manner, up to about 100,000 people.
And this is during a period when Roman slavery had been growing so quickly. Over the past 200 years, Roman slavery had expanded to a level that that had never seen before, and the number of enslaved people was so high within the Italic peninsula. So, I mean, I think Spartacus deserves all of those kudos, but we also have to ask ourselves about other enslaved people into the period of the Empire, and part of that is looking at enslaved people that rebel against Rome, whether they’re mint workers, whether they’re charioteers, whether they’re bear trainers, that we never have a slave revolt that is to the level of Spartacus that we know of within the Roman Empire for the rest of its existence, there’s never a rebellion that is to the degree that Spartacus inspired and carried out, but that there are still enslaved people that went on strike and that engaged in joining collegia.
And so circling back to that first thesis that I was talking about, just because enslaved people exist within a society does not mean that there cannot be labor organization and that there cannot be people working together for a higher purpose, right? And so sometimes that purpose is manumission, and sometimes that purpose is to get higher wages. But just because they’re enslaved does not mean that they’re completely impotent or without any power within this labor economy.
Nima: Well, I think that is a perfect place to leave it. Sarah, this has been so wonderful, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on this Citations Needed livestream Beg-a-Thon. It has been truly wonderful to talk to you, Sarah. We have been speaking with Dr. Sarah E. Bond, Associate Professor in the Classics at the University of Iowa. You do have, like, a longer title: Erling B. “Jack” Holtsmark?
Sarah E. Bond: I’m an endowed chair in the history, I’m technically in the History Department with an appointment in Classics. I have a chair. It does not matter.
Nima: I feel like I need to read that title. It’s very prestigious.
Sarah E. Bond: It doesn’t, well, it doesn’t mean that much, except for, you know, that I feel very lucky to have the job that I do, that this is my job, that I get to do all day. So that’s good enough.
Nima: Yeah, that’s very Stoic of you.
Sarah E. Bond: I see what you did there. I see what you did there.
Adam: She’s the emperor, though. That’s objectively a great job.
Nima: Sarah, of course, is the author of the incredible new book. Adam and I both read it.
Adam: We actually read it. We didn’t fake-read it. We actually read it.
Nima: Man, is it fucking great. So please pick it up. The book is, of course, Strike: Labor, Unions, and Resistance in the Roman Empire, out now from Yale University Press. But Sarah, thank you so much for joining us today on Citations Needed. It has been amazing to have you.
Sarah E. Bond: Thank you for having me. Hopefully, I’ll see you again.
Nima: Indeed.
Sarah E. Bond: Maybe in five years, but hopefully sooner.
Nima: Hopefully much sooner. But that will do it for this Citations Needed livestream Beg-a-Thon, thank you all for listening.

“Though you are a whole world, Rome, still, without love, the world’s not the world, and Rome cannot be Rome.” — Goethe
This book. I had this idea of traveling based on the books I was reading, and after nearly four years in Rome, I realized I had never read a book about the city itself. Perhaps I was too caught up in my daily struggles — and let me tell you, my life in Rome hasn’t been easy. Maybe my expectations were too high, or, as Goethe said, love was simply absent, and Rome wasn’t truly Rome to me. But this isn’t my story. Let’s get back to Anthony Doerr’s memoir.
As I write my humble thoughts on this memoir, I find myself flipping through its pages, revisiting the passages I underlined — the moments that touched my heart, the parts where I saw my own Roman story reflected. To be honest, Doerr’s first impressions of Rome mirrored how I felt after a year, maybe a year and a half, of living here.
I came to Rome for my master’s degree — my second one, actually — not just for academic reasons but as a way to escape Istanbul, to finally do something I had long felt was inevitable. I had always known my story wasn’t meant to unfold in just one city or country, though I had imagined it would be London, not Rome.
And yet, when I finally opened my eyes and truly started feeling Rome, it was exactly as Doerr described: noticing the endless sea of scooters, marveling at (or being horrified by) Italian driving, being simultaneously enchanted and frustrated by the city. In those early days, I was also angry — maybe disappointed — by what I had found here. And as I read through the beginning of Four Seasons in Rome, I could feel that same unease in Doerr’s words.
Throughout the pages, you experience what it’s like to be a parent to newborn twins — and, honestly, I’d much rather live that experience through his eyes than my own. But being in a foreign country doesn’t make it any easier. Even though our circumstances were different, there was one feeling we both shared: navigating this city while feeling lost — most of the time.
The missing piece, though, is love. I’m not sure if I should call myself fortunate, but in that regard, I’ve been quite lucky — if letting my heart get broken over and over counts as luck. I found real love here and lost it here. I cried here. I lost hope here. And yet, to truly experience Rome, love wasn’t necessary. As Doerr writes:
“And what about Rome? Rome is beautiful, Rome is ugly. Something about this city exacerbates contrast, the incongruities and contradictions…”
Rome has a way of filling that void in its own way, making sure you feel everything — whether you want to or not.
In the beginning, or let’s say during Fall, the book feels more factual, focused on adjustment. Doerr shares details about Rome, its quirks, its history. But as we move into Spring and Summer, we witness — or at least I felt — his gradual acceptance of the city, his growing appreciation for its beauty. And in these later chapters, the book shifts into something deeper. Not overwhelming, not philosophical, but it subtly invites the reader to take a step back, to ask certain questions, to reflect.
You should take note of the places Doerr mentions in this book — mostly around Monteverde, one of my favorite areas in Rome.
I’m not sure if anyone would be interested, so I won’t be sharing my full Roman guide, but I do want to give a shoutout to my favorite restaurants for the best carbonara. Why?
When I first moved to Rome, I was almost vegetarian — pescatarian, to be exact. While my friends indulged in legendary plates of pasta alla carbonara, I could only watch and wonder what all the fuss was about.
Then, for love, I started eating meat again. To be precise, I now eat guanciale, Italian cold cuts, poultry, and seafood — so really, there’s not much left off the menu, is there?
Naturally, my return to the eating-it-all era had to start with the famous carbonara. This passion quickly turned into a habit — I now order pasta alla carbonara every time I dine out. Here are some of my favorite spots to enjoy it:
I could go on forever — food is my passion, after all. But I suppose this article was meant to be about a book.
Okay, back to the book:
I’m so envious of Doerr for writing such a brilliantly pure, beautifully written book. No flashy marketing of la dolce vita — God knows I’m tired of the glossy image of Rome when the reality is far from dolce. He presents it all in a way that feels honest, and I couldn’t help but see parallels between the way Rome made him feel and the way I’ve felt since moving here.
I envy him even more because he came to Rome for a set period, with no trouble finding an apartment (thank you, Pope, honestly), which gave him the opportunity to experience the city without the complications that often come with living here. Or maybe the struggle is the true Roman experience. I’m not sure… Rome is my great dilemma and paradox.
Overall, I’m glad I don’t have to experience this city with newborn twins. I’m grateful for the daily challenges of living here and for the chance to experience life in its raw, unfiltered form. Rome is a beautiful city, though flawed in many ways. I can’t see myself growing old here — but that’s for purely professional reasons.
Finally, the author’s writing is captivating. Whether you live here or not, perhaps in another place, you’ll find yourself immersed in his story through his eyes. I absolutely loved this memoir, and it’s definitely a must-read. As he wrote:
“Roma, they say, non basta una vita. One life is not enough.”

When I tossed a small Italian lira coin into the Trevi fountain back in June 1987, it was to ensure my return to Rome someday, in accordance with the famous legend. On the cusp of turning 17, I had all the optimism in the world that I would indeed be back. And I was right. It just took a few decades. But lucky for me, Rome is known for being eternal and was waiting here for me.
A lot has changed since I was last here. My sunken coin is, of course, long gone. The lira isn’t even Italy’s currency anymore, having been replaced by the euro in 2002. Most importantly, I now have a greater appreciation of history than I did as a teenager. Back then, I just wanted to meet European boys, get served alcohol underage, and go out dancing with my friends. My pictures were mostly of our silly fun in hotel rooms or on the bus, and my more serious scenic ones came out dark, blurry, or had my finger in them.
This time around, I plan to mix sightseeing and trying to live like a local for a month, much like I did when I spent 30 days in Paris working remotely last summer. Exploring all of the Roman ruins there inspired me to head right to the source. My great-grandparents came to the United States from Italy, so I also want to soak in the Italian culture on a deeper level and make time for some quiet moments sitting in parks just observing people or while walking ancient roads like the old Appian Way.
I only had a few days to see the famous Roman sites that summer of ’87 so long ago. I was on a “Discovering Europe” group tour of around 50 people, mostly high school students and some parent-chaperones, which was arranged by my high school Spanish teacher. We had 24 days to see nine cities in four countries. Rome was a blur. I mainly remember our tour of the Colosseum, seeing where the Pope lives, and not liking the pizza.
I actually still have the travel journal I kept on that trip and dug it out of storage recently so that I could refresh my memory and maybe have a few laughs. It did not disappoint. Page after page of black cursive handwriting captured my deep teenage thoughts.
“I don’t like Rome at all. Our hotel room is right by a busy street. And just like in Paris people drive like maniacs beeping horns all the time.”
“Today sucked! We had to get up early to see the Palace of Versailles. It was a boring tour.”
“We went to a fast food place called Burger Quick. I only got a soda (6 francs) but the hamburgers I saw were gross! They were so rare!”
“In Venice we went on the most boringest walking tour ever! I was so tired I tried to sleep as I walked.”
I imagine my dusty travel journal being found a hundred years from now by my great-great-grandchildren in an attic somewhere. They would flip through the pages and marvel at the indecipherable writing. Thinking maybe it’s cuneiform or ancient Sanskrit, they take it to an antique dealer to see if it’s worth anything. Maybe even pay to have the cursive “translated” to see what profound insights were captured so painstakingly by hand. I imagine the translator gently revealing the contents to them.
“Well, she talks a lot about long bus rides, gross foreign food, and having to wake up too early for boring tours of churches and palaces. But, you know, things were hard back in the 20th century.”
I might not have had a big interest in art, culture, food, or history during that high school trip, but it did definitely awakened my curiosity about the world and gave me insight into how people in other countries lived. It even opened my mind to the world of politics a bit. In Italy, for example, I saw political graffiti, some of it anti-American, spray painted in English as our bus drove through the busy Roman streets. One night after dinner we strolled through St. Peter’s Square in Vatican City and came across a candle-holding procession of people. Our guide told us that they were protesting the Pope’s election of a man who was believed to be an ex Nazi war criminal. I filed these and other important learnings away in the back of my teenage brain since the highlight of that particular evening (according to my journal) was hanging out on the steps of a church near our hotel, listening to a portable radio and dancing around until our curfew came.
In my first Paris article, I talked about all of the funny mistakes I made on my first trips to Europe, such as washing my underwear and socks in a bidet in my Paris hotel room because I thought it was just another sink. Well, the faux pas streak continued a week later in Rome when I again used the sink to wash my shirts and shorts (a real one this time, not a bidet). I decided to hang them to dry over the railing of my partial balcony, which faced a busy Roman street. When I came back hours later, my clothes were hanging in various spots around the room, still wet. A chaperone soon told us that hanging clothes outdoors so close to the Vatican was forbidden and not to do it. My not-so-bright idea didn’t sit well with housekeeping, nor the papacy, apparently. Who knows though, I bet when no one’s looking, the Pope puts his big pointy hat on his window ledge every once in a while to air it out.
I grew up on the East Coast of the United States, so to me “old” was something that was built a few hundred years ago, not thousands like you see in Rome. My hometown of Bristol, Pennsylvania, was founded in 1681. That’s pretty old for a town in the United States, though it’s certainly not the oldest. For comparison, Philadelphia traces its roots back to 1682, New York City to 1624, and Boston to 1630. St. Augustine, Florida, has them all beat, though, having been continuously inhabited since 1565. Of course, if you head to the Southwest, you’ll find even older places that native Americans built.
One of my favorite places to eat in Bristol is the King George II Inn & Tavern, which is the oldest continuously operating inn in the country. I always thought it was cool that some of our founding fathers came through its doors, including a young George Washington, John Adams, and James Madison. Even France’s Marquis de Lafayette ate there, probably munching on an early variation of a burger and French fries (well, to him it would just be “fries,” I guess). That early fascination is probably why I tend to seek out pubs and restaurants that are considered “the oldest” in the cities I visit, and why I love to stay at historic hotels.
I remember the first time I encountered something much, much older and how it made my head spin with awe. I was working temporarily in London and took a day trip to Warwick Castle one weekend. At 23, I still wasn’t much into history, but since we did a lot of date memorizing in history classes, I remembered distinctly that in 1066 that famous William guy did his conquering thing and became King of England.
While walking around the grounds of the castle he had built, I became fixated on the dirt path I was following, imagining how he might have walked this same dusty path. I could literally be walking in William the Conqueror’s footsteps, I thought excitedly. History really came to life for me at that moment. If only teleportation were a thing, field trips for World History class would be way more interesting.
It’s even more amazing when something so old is still in use. Once when I was in Adana, Turkey, in the late ’90s, my husband and I were in a cab sitting in rush hour traffic and were amazed when the driver told us that the stone bridge we were stuck on was built by the Romans in the 2nd century. Imagine a structure surviving nearly 2,000 years intact possibly being taken down by a distracted driver on their cell phone or fumbling with the radio. I was happy to read years later that they banned cars on it in 2007, and now it’s open only to foot traffic.
The Romans sure knew how to build things to last. The Colosseum would be completely intact today if it wasn’t for earthquakes and people in the Middle Ages pillaging its stone blocks to use for other buildings. Then there’s the old Appian Way. I can’t wait to walk along what’s considered the oldest road in the world (that’s still visible). That expression — “All roads lead to Rome”? Well, this road is the mother of them all. It’s so old, some of the stones still have grooves in them from chariot wheels (and we think potholes are bad). I’m sure I’ll have a time-travel mind melt when I imagine myself walking in the footsteps of historical heavyweights such as Julius Caesar and Spartacus. Though not literally: Caesar’s feet probably never had to touch the ground, being a conquering dictator and all, and well, poor Spartacus was crucified on the old Appian Way along with thousands of other rebellious gladiators.
Starting in late May, I’ll be trying to live like a local while staying at an apartment in the Monteverde neighborhood, just south of Trastevere. It’s about an hour walk from my place to the Colosseum, so I definitely hope to be living away from the tourist crowds, especially since this is a Jubilee year for the Catholic Church, which happens only once every 25 years. There’s no metro stop on my side of the river, but there are buses, trams, and of course my two feet. I’ll need to get in as many steps as I can if I’m going to eat all of the things on my checklist.
I need to redeem my teenage self’s dislike of the one pizza experience I had in Rome, so there will be lots of pizza tasting of all shapes and sizes. I’m not really into meat toppings, so I’ll probably just do plain, but there are some interesting veggies to try on pizza like radicchio, zucchini flowers, and squash blossoms. And of course there’s the pasta. I learned that there are four classics I have to try in Rome: Gricia (ancient), Amatriciana, Carbonara, and Cacio e Pepe. I’m not sure if I’ll work up the courage to try the specialty dishes made with offal (intestines, stomach lining, etc.). Though I’m willing to try meatballs made with cow tail (oxtail) and the famous Saltimbocca alla Romana (veal). There’s also a fancy bologna-like lunchmeat called mortadella that looks interesting.
I’ll also of course make time to do some sightseeing when I’m not working. So much time has passed since my last visit to Rome there’s even been a new exciting discovery. In my teenage travel journal, I wrote that I had visited the Forum ruins where our tour guide Ned told us Julius Caesar was assassinated. But turns out that was wrong. Excavations in 2012 uncovered markings by Caesar’s successor Augustus where he designated the exact spot. Turns out, it happened in the Curia di Pompey, a meeting place within the Pompey Theater complex that the Senators were using while the Senate House was being renovated. In 2023 a raised walkway was built over the excavation site so that visitors could get a closer look.
I’m sure I’ll have many moments where I try to imagine myself living among the ancient Romans. Like Russell Crowe’s character Maximus did in the Gladiator movie, I like to run my hands along tall grasses and plant leaves within my reach. It’s something I do no matter where I am walking, but in a place with lots of history, it helps me to feel connected to the people who were there centuries before me. It’s the same with touching walls, trees, and stones (when it’s allowed). Though my hands won’t be going anywhere near the stone latrine seats of the ancient communal bathrooms that I hope to see when touring the nearby ruins of Ostia Antica. I don’t need to imagine that part of ancient Roman life.
I am, however, open to the idea of using a bidet. In a kind of weird, come-full-circle plot twist, the apartment I’m renting has a bathroom with a bidet right next to the toilet. The place does have a washer and dryer, so don’t worry — my underwear and socks will be properly laundered this time.
Eventually, I plan to document here on Medium how it all went. Until then, follow my stories and posts on Instagram (@pammypez).

In the annals of Roman history, certain names echo with legendary resonance: Caesar, Augustus, Nero. Yet, there are emperors whose legacies, though significant, shimmer less vividly in the collective memory. Among these, Lucius Verus (130–169 AD) stands as a compelling figure, whose reign alongside Marcus Aurelius marked a period of both prosperity and profound challenges for the Roman Empire.
The Path to Power
Lucius Verus’ path to the imperial throne was both unique and a reflection of the complex adoption practices among Roman elites. Born Lucius Ceionius Commodus, his rise to prominence came through a series of strategic adoptions orchestrated by Hadrian to ensure a smooth succession. Hadrian first adopted Antoninus Pius on the condition that Antoninus would subsequently adopt both Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Ceionius Commodus (the future Lucius Verus). This series of adoptions was aimed at securing a stable and capable line of succession.
Upon Hadrian’s death, Antoninus Pius became emperor, and Lucius Verus, alongside Marcus Aurelius, was groomed for future leadership. The true moment of Lucius Verus’ accession began when Antoninus Pius died in 161 AD. In a historic move, Marcus Aurelius, immediately upon becoming emperor, insisted on sharing power with Lucius Verus, thereby elevating him to the status of co-emperor. This decision was groundbreaking, marking the first time in Roman history that the empire was officially ruled by two emperors simultaneously. The co-emperorship was a testament to their close relationship and Marcus Aurelius’ desire for a balanced and shared rule.
Military Endeavors
Lucius Verus’ reign was significantly shaped by his military campaigns, particularly in the East. The Parthian War (161–166 AD) stands out as the most notable. Initially, Verus was criticized for his seemingly luxurious lifestyle in Antioch, away from the front lines. However, under his nominal command, Roman forces, led by capable generals such as Avidius Cassius, achieved significant victories, including the capture of the Parthian capital, Ctesiphon, in 165 AD. These successes expanded Roman influence in the East and brought substantial booty back to Rome, but they also inadvertently introduced a devastating plague that would afflict the empire for years.
Coinage and Public Image
The coinage of Lucius Verus, like that of many Roman emperors, served as a vital tool for propaganda and the projection of imperial authority. His coins frequently depicted themes of victory and divine favor, reinforcing his and Marcus Aurelius’ status as protectors and benefactors of the empire. The imagery on these coins, ranging from representations of conquered territories to symbols of military success, played a crucial role in shaping public perception of his reign.
Architectural Contributions and Public Works
Although Lucius Verus’ rule is less noted for monumental architecture than that of his co-emperor Marcus Aurelius, his contributions to Rome’s urban landscape were not insignificant. He and Marcus Aurelius jointly dedicated the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, transforming a personal monument into a public space of worship. Additionally, the triumphal arches and other structures erected in their honor celebrated their military victories and served as enduring symbols of their joint rule.
Personal Life and Legacy
Verus’ personal life, marked by his marriage to Marcus Aurelius’ daughter Lucilla, was integral to the political and familial alliances that underpinned the stability of their co-emperorship. His untimely death in 169 AD, possibly due to the plague that followed the Parthian campaign, brought an end to this unique period of dual rule. In the aftermath, Marcus Aurelius continued to govern alone, facing further military and social challenges without the partnership that had characterized their approach to leadership.
Lucius Verus’ reign, though overshadowed by that of his more philosophically inclined co-emperor, was a pivotal period in the history of the Roman Empire. His military successes bolstered Rome’s territorial and strategic standing, while his coinage and public works projects contributed to the civic and cultural life of the empire. Despite the brevity of his rule and the challenges that marred it, Verus’ legacy is a testament to the complexities and contradictions of imperial leadership in ancient Rome.
Conclusion
Lucius Verus, often overlooked in the shadow of Marcus Aurelius, was a figure of considerable importance in the Roman imperial pantheon. His unique position as co-emperor, his military accomplishments, and his role in the cultural and economic life of the empire offer valuable insights into the dynamics of Roman imperial rule and the challenges it faced. As we reflect on his legacy, we are reminded of the myriad ways in which power, politics, and personal ambition intersect in the annals of history, shaping the destinies of empires and their rulers.

Since the election in America, I have had to take a few somewhat drastic steps to maintain my sanity, and they began with divorcing myself from any and all news, primarily anything related to politics. Someone else I know called it Ostrich Mode, but I prefer to think of it as Turtle Mode. A complete withdrawal from most of society. Knowing how impulsive I can sometimes be, it’s hard to believe this will be a long-term thing, but you never know.
Therefore, out of fairness to all our writers, I am suspending the acceptance of any new writing at this time. I don’t want to ignore those trying to publish and I realize I risk permanently losing both readers and writers, but my only alternative is to either ignore the publication altogether, or delete it. I would prefer not deleting it at this time. The publication will remain live. I just won’t be accepting any new stories for the time being. I thank you for your understanding, and good luck.
If and when I regain some equilibrium, I’ll let you know and we’ll get back to business.

Bam, here we are, back in his apartment close to Altitude 100, where the chicken drawing has been set straight. The place is clean, relatively orderly now and C. is cooking a gourmet dinner for us. He is French, you can’t teach much more to a French guy who knows how to cook. You mostly sit down and enjoy the food he is making and the show of him making it. The ingredients come out of brown paper wrappings, not from plastic bags. The man loves to show his skill. Nevertheless, he burns a couple of the dishes, possibly stage fright? That’s OK, I think I’m getting used to his way of self-sabotaging his best intentions. So we sit down and eat some very sophisticated, yet burned entrées, under the modernistic chicken gaze.
There is no male gaze anywhere that I can see here, but there is this chicken looking down on us. This brings an offbeat touch to things. I feel safe with him, he is generous and open. His engaged leftism makes me look centrist at best, in many topics and it makes me reconsider some of my positions. He is softly teasing me about working for a big nasty corporation, in marketing of all things. While he is the gauchist journalist investigating big…

Every successful school of thought, religion and system that has endured the test of time has one common precept: When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
It means that if your idea is universal enough to offer food for thought and even some enlightening properties, your approach must be adaptable to changing circumstances, cultures and norms. But with one catch: the core teaching must remain universal and comprehensive — intact.
The saying I quoted earlier comes from the 4th century Bishop of Milan, St Ambrose. He was a theologian and statesman with solid leadership, profoundly shaping early Christian theology and doctrine.
Ambrose was what we call an inspirational speaker. He could wow the audience but didn’t let popularity blur his views. He didn’t let anything dilute his faith and was fierce against heresy. The saying attributed to him tells us about a person who is pragmatic yet has strong integrity.

Migrants poured over the southern border. Many came for jobs after employment options in their home regions had dried up; others were attracted to the excitement and glamour of their destination. Soon the influx began to worry leading politicians, who authorized a series of enforcement actions against select categories of immigrants. Deportations, they believed, would put an end to the mess. No luck: undeterred, the immigrants kept coming.
At last, one politician ventured a proposal. Why not extend the citizenship? Not to all non-citizens, of course — just to one specific, carefully circumscribed subset. But one party was having none of it: “if you give them citizenship,” the party’s spokesman insisted, “you assume (I think) that you’ll still have the same political rights and worship in the same way as you do now. But don’t you realize that those people will take over everything?” The proposal withered on the vine.
The speaker of these lines was Gaius Fannius, consul in 122 BCE and a dogged opponent of Gaius Gracchus’ proposal to extend the citizenship to Rome’s Latin allies. For all its celebrated inclusivity, ancient Rome had residents and leaders who were none too pleased about the continuous stream of immigrants: Fannius’ warning is a distant echo of Donald Trump’s “we either have a country or we don’t have a country.” Romans were as willing as many Americans are today to give this displeasure political and legal expression.
But why undertake this rewriting of late republican Rome in the first place? Partly because in doing so I join a modern conversation about immigration that — in both Europe and America — regularly and explicitly adduces parallels from the ancient world as justification for various kinds of immigration policy. In this article, I’ll examine the sentimental and rhetorical configurations through which ancient Rome (and Greece) are put to work in contemporary discussions of immigration and outline how Romans themselves perceived and responded to immigration during the Republic and Empire. In a second, follow-up article, I’ll explore how mobility in the ancient Mediterranean structurally mirrored 21st-century migration towards Europe and the United States. Ancient history can clarify how we think about recent developments, just not in the way(s) normally assumed.
Let me stress that my own perspective as a formerly undocumented immigrant with emphatically pro-migrant political commitments informs what and how I write. No Tacitean disavowal of bias for me. But I hope that even those who do not share my views on immigration will consider how antiquity can be repurposed in modern conversations about immigration.
Writing in the pages of The Wall Street Journal, Cambridge classicist Mary Beard recently asserted that the Romans “would have been puzzled by today’s hostility to migrants.” Well before the publication of the op-ed, Beard made use of her status as one of Britain’s foremost public intellectuals to offer a liberal perspective — sometimes greeted with viciously misogynistic hostility — on contemporary migrant and refugee matters.
The tradition of roping the ancient world into assessments of modern immigration has been a fixture of British political and cultural discourses for quite some time: Enoch Powell’s infamous 1968 “Rivers of Blood” speech (complete with Vergilian allusion) standing at one end of the political spectrum, with Boris Johnson’s 2006 Dream of Rome closer to the other. As Mayor of London, Johnson has continued beating the classical drum, issuing warnings that Britain will turn into the ancient state least like Rome in its treatment of foreigners — Sparta — should it adhere to plans to reduce its net migration.
On the other side of the Atlantic, another professional classicist has intervened in the immigration debates: Victor Davis Hanson. Not one to be deterred by the prospect of controversy, Hanson waded into the immigration-policy waters with his 2003 hybrid-genre book Mexifornia. After first observing that “America is what Rome once was to hustling Jews, Greeks and Numidians” (p. 51), Hanson goes on to claim in his epilogue that the “freedom and material dynamism of the West are drawing millions to its shores — in the manner that Athens once attracted metics from Asia, and Rome drew Africans, Jews and Armenians” (p. 142). (And as proof that classicists holding forth on immigration can irritate members of the political establishment, one need look no further than Hanson: after introducing himself as a “classicist” at a Capitol Hill briefing the year of his book’s publication, Hanson was reportedly accosted by a Congressional staffer who thought he had heard Hanson term himself a “classist”; the face-off ended with the staffer exiting the briefing in anger.)
Comparisons of modern America to ancient Rome are, of course, nothing new, and so hackneyed by now as to inspire a book-length rebuttal. But in recent decades many of these comparisons have been fueled by anxieties about immigration, particularly of the illegal/undocumented variety. Actress and conservative politician Clare Boothe Luce expressed concern in a 1982 Washington Post interview that the United States might be headed “for the fate of ancient Rome … a city of pollution and noise and foreigners, [that] collapsed under the weight of the barbarians.”
Since 9/11, the argument that a lax immigration policy will hasten the United States’ Rome-like demise has steadily gained traction. A 2004 Florida Times-Union editorial on “illegal immigration and the problems that go with it” ended on this ominous note: “ancient Rome couldn’t, or wouldn’t, stop the influx of barbarians across its border.” Taking to The Washington Post in 2007 to outline a “tolerant but also tough” vision for US immigration policy, Yale Law School professor Amy Chua reminded her readers that the “greatest empire in history, ancient Rome, collapsed when its cultural and political glue dissolved … [i]n part, this fragmentation occurred because of a massive influx of immigrants from a very different culture.” Three years later, Stevens Institute of Technology professor Silvio Laccetti argued that Rome’s extension of its citizenship through the Edict of Caracalla had precipitated an “erosion of civic pride and responsibility” in the course of outlining his own proposal of a tolerant but tough immigration scheme. And in undoubtedly the most entertaining riff on the Rome conceit, Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) went full Cicero on the Senate floor — framing Obama as Catiline — following the President’s November 2014 announcement of an executive order deferring the deportation of undocumented parents of American citizens and permanent residents.
You wouldn’t be wrong to suspect that the genealogy I’ve charted so far has an even deeper history: the practice of invoking the Roman Republic and Empire’s treatment of immigrants as paradigmatic and/or cautionary is already on display in the state- and nation-building discourses of the early modern period. Edward Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire reserves the purplest of its purple prose for the barbarians at the gate and the Fifth Column of immigrant slaves and domestics waiting to welcome them. (Last year, a lengthy rumination — sprinkled with block quotations from Decline and Fall — on Gibbon’s continuing relevance was posted to breitbart.com under the pseudonym “Virgil” and triggered over 1400 comments, mostly effusions of agreement.) Before Gibbon, Montesquieu had sketched the contribution of foreigners and barbarians to Rome’s imperial dissolution in chapter 16 of his Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline.
But well before either, Machiavelli had taken a somewhat different line on immigration in Discourses on Livy, praising Rome’s openness to foreigners as integral to the amassing of the military and economic power through which the republic set itself apart from Athens and Sparta (II.3). Machiavelli wasn’t just anticipating Boris Johnson’s evaluation of Roman greatness as a consequence of open migration. Diligent reader of Livy that he was, Machiavelli was putting his finger on a line of argument that reached back to the ancients themselves.
The history of rhetorically positioning Rome’s treatment of immigrants really begins in antiquity, with both Greeks and Romans chiming in on the fluctuating — and at times very divergent — trends in the Republic and Empire’s openness. Having worked our way backwards in time to the ancients, we should now pause and ask: how open were Romans to foreigners, really? It turns out that Romans were far more ambivalent about immigration than some moderns give them credit for.
In the first decade of the war with Hannibal, a Macedonian king turned Roman adversary praised the Republic’s free and easy bestowal of citizenship in a letter exchange with a Greek city-state. In a world where city-states could be quite stingy with grants of citizenship — especially Sparta, notorious for its deportations — Rome had so succeeded in marketing itself as exceptional that even an enemy felt compelled to take notice. This marketing took several forms, and the one that has left the most durable imprint on literary and non-literary sources alike is Rome’s origin myth.
In contrast to the Greek city-states whose origin stories indulged the fantasy of autochthony (according to which a community and its members sprang up from the earth in the place they inhabited), Rome promoted itself as the product of immigrants. Molded during the turbulent centuries of Italian and Mediterranean expansion, Rome’s legendary history began with an illegal immigrant: pious Aeneas, fleeing with his family and friends from the devastation of Troy household gods in hand, elderly father on his back, young son by his side.
As canonized in the Aeneid, the challenges faced by the founder of the Roman race include some of the traditional (epic) dilemmas of travel — where to go and how long to stay, whose hospitality to accept and whose to decline — Homeric effects translated for a Roman audience. And once Aeneas and his band do arrive on Italian shores, they are denied the happily-ever-after outcome. Their lot is to contend with belligerence, grief, early death.
Some months ago, Michael Fontaine proposed in this publication a reading of the Aeneid’s second half that aligns rather felicitously with contemporary geopolitical events. On one level, the Aeneas myth internalizes the plight of immigrants/refugees (fato profugi); at the same time, it gives form to the mirror anxiety of those native residents who from the first encounter feel that the new arrivals will take their land and resources and women.
Spinning out this thread further, I’d add that the ambivalence towards refugees and immigrants woven into the Aeneas legend reflects centuries of unease at Rome about the presence and role of foreigners. The unease was embodied in the mythic personas of Aeneas, Romulus, and Remus, all three of whom were remembered as thieves, rapists, and murderers. Here comparison with the modern myth of the immigrant as criminal is instructive. Earlier this year, to thumps and cheers, Trump laid out his campaign platform on immigration:
“The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems…When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best…They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us [sic]. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”
Trump and his partisans seem to have a complementary myth at hand: the “Ellis Island” arrivals of virtuous character and exemplary work ethic (unlike today’s purveyors of drugs and crime). Much the same conflict between these two alternate ideals of the immigrant played out in ancient Rome. As Rome expanded, nativist and xenophobic discourses proliferated, with consequences for the waves of immigrants settling down in Rome in the last centuries of the Republic and first few centuries of the Empire.
These discourses had sharp legal teeth. On top of the targeted removals and expulsions of groups identified as religiously and/or philosophical suspect — the Bacchants in 186 BCE, philosophers in 161 and 154, Chaldaeans and Jews in 139 — immigrants hailing from communities elsewhere in Italy were deported on multiple occasions in the years 187–172 (citations and discussion: Noy, Foreigners at Rome, pp. 37–47). Sometime in the 120s, a law was passed expelling all foreigners from the city of Rome; another version of the law was passed in 65 BCE. Thanks to the Severan-era historian Cassius Dio, we know something of the reasons for the second law’s passage (37.9): not only were foreigners believed to be too numerous, it was worried that they weren’t suitable enough (epitedeioi) to live alongside Romans.
It’s worth remembering that throughout this entire time Rome still had a republican system of government. These laws were ratified by popular will and not autocratic imposition. Since foreigners couldn’t necessarily be identified on sight (any romano di Roma stood a decent chance of being physically indistinguishable from an immigrant), it is anyone’s guess how these laws were enforced. The association of specific neighborhoods with certain groups of immigrants may have played a role in the orchestration of round-ups.
We do know that one Roman witness to the law of 65 did not like what he saw. Characterizing this law and its predecessor from the 120s as designed not only to deny foreigners access to Rome but to deport those already living there (eosque exterminant), Cicero declares in the De officiis that “denying foreigners access to our city is patently inhumane” (3.11.47). Although he managed to successfully defend the poet Aulus Licinius Archias from deportation, Cicero laments in a letter to his friend Atticus that the same law had been deployed, out of spite, to condemn (and presumably deport) a freedman assistant to the politician and former consul Aulus Gabinius after Gabinius beat charges of political corruption.
Neither the moral nor rhetorical authority of Cicero could halt the policing and deportation of certain categories of immigrants; the practice persisted well into the Empire. Yet immigrants kept on coming. The satirist Juvenal’s bombastic xenophobe Umbricius couldn’t abide their presence: “Romans, I can’t tolerate the city being Greek. Yet what portion of the shit is really Greek? For a long time now the Syrian Orontes has poured into the Tiber…” (Sat. 3.58–60). But for the Greek-speaking author of The Learned Banqueters, it was precisely Rome’s embrace of different immigrant populations that enhanced its glory: it was a heavenly city, encompassing so many foreign populations as to defy enumeration (Deipn. 1.20b-c).
We should be careful to respect the differences between ancient Rome and the modern US (or Europe). For example, the preoccupation with “border enforcement” wasn’t quite as intense among the Romans — though perhaps the time has come to read Augustus’ reported advice to Tiberius to “keep the empire’s borders secure” (my consciously tendentious rendering of Tacitus’ enigmatic coercendi intra terminos imperii) and/or Aelius Aristides’ praise of the Empire’s walls in his Roman Oration as implicated in a kind of border politics. And at no point in its trajectory from Republic or Empire was Rome a nation in the modern sense.
But with these caveats out of the way, I want to underline a few fundamental similarities between the immigration sensibilities of ancient Rome and those of 21st-century America. Then as now, foundation myths about the state as the creation of immigrants articulated and projected deeply felt anxieties about the legacy of past immigrants and the presence of current ones. Then as now, some of those anxieties were worked out through legal-administrative means, with deportation privileged as a technology of control. Then as now, foreigners stood to lose the most in confrontations between political elites — think back to Gabinius’ freedman. Then as now, the immigrant influx could inspire despair over the country going to rot or euphoria at its cosmopolitan inclusivity. Then as now, immigrants were vulnerable to hate crimes.
Hate crimes, you say?
Earlier this year, “Death to Islam” was spray-painted on the wall of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Heritage Association center in Spokane, Washington. Thousands of hate crimes are reported in the United States each year. These figures — dismayingly consistent from year to year — probably underrepresent the true number of hate crimes perpetrated. Setting aside for now the reliability of the FBI statistics, I want to concentrate on the graffito as medium for xenophobia. Even for the spray-painter, there is ancient precedent.
At some point during the second century CE, a tombstone was set up in Rome under the supervision of a certain Charitonius Mercurius for a deceased cavalry officer. From the tombstone we learn that the officer — whose name is not preserved in what remains of the inscription — was of Arabian extraction (natione Arabus); he’d lived to the age of 35, soldiering for 16 of those years and attaining the rank of eques singularis along the way. Many examples of this type of inscription survive, but in this case the real kicker comes in the form of a Greek graffito left behind by someone, possibly a fellow cavalry officer, that reads: Θ. Ἄραπσι (“Death to the Arabs!”).
The cultural and linguistic complexities of xenophobic resentment in Imperial Rome were such that a Greek-speaking resident of Rome could scrawl an ethnic taunt on a monument to a Latin-speaking native of the Near East. Romans were quite skilled at the use of graffiti to mock the immigrant Other: the late second/early third-century CE graffito from the Palatine featuring a donkey on a crucifix and the tag (again in Greek) “Alexamenos worships God” may be the earliest example of such visual denigration being applied to Greek-speaking Christians residing in Rome — and takes us back to the anxiety voiced by Gaius Fannius that immigrants would menace religious practices at home.
But my interest in summoning up the ghost of the graffito artist who marked up the tombstone has to do with the fantasy of violence folded into the tag. The cavalry officer was already dead, else he might have had a thing or two to say to the violator of his memorial. Alive and far more vulnerable was the homeless Mexican man recently beaten by two Boston men, one of whom claimed as his inspiration Donald Trump’s call to deport the undocumented.
Trump’s rhetoric justifies the commission of acts of violence against immigrants by characterizing them as inherently violent. On the stump, he has bemoaned the scourge of rapists, murderers and thieves originating not only in Mexico but “coming from all over South and Latin America and … coming probably, probably, from the Middle East.” It doesn’t seem to register among his fans that the “problem” of immigrant crime is a fiction: multiple studies carried out over the past century have repeatedly confirmed that immigrants commit crime at lower rates than the general population. What does register is the fear-mongering, especially among those already inclined to believe that white Americans are endangered: in July a petition was posted to WhiteHouse.gov asking President Obama to honor Trump “for opposing white genocide.”
Once the immigrant is construed as an existential threat, xenophobic sentiment rallies around the idea of removing that threat by any and all means necessary. Both in ancient Rome and in modern America, the fear of immigrants activates not only the desire to remove their bodies from sight through deportation, but to deprive them of life — to destroy them.

December 1, 2024First Sunday of Advent, Year CSt. Stephen’s UMC, Burke, VARomans 8:18–25 (NRSVUE)**A Sermon Series on Fuquay’s The Way to Bethlehem
For this season of Advent — a time of anticipation and preparation for the coming Christ — we will base our sermon series on Rob Fuquay’s book titled On the Way to Bethlehem: An Advent Study.
Throughout this series, we will visit four key places, starting with Rome, then moving to Jerusalem and Nazareth, and finally arriving in Bethlehem. My prayer is that as we embark on this journey together, the Spirit will guide us closer to the humble manger in Bethlehem, where we encounter Love Incarnate — God-with-us — the one named Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, and Prince of Peace.
You may wonder why we start with Rome. All the other locations seem straightforward. The Gospel of Luke begins in Jerusalem, where the angel announced Elizabeth’s pregnancy to Zechariah who was serving in the temple. Then it moves to Nazareth, where the same angel announced the pregnancy news to Elizabeth’s much younger cousin, Mary. Afterward, Mary and Joseph had to travel to Bethlehem, where Jesus was ultimately born.
So, why does this Advent journey start in Ancient Rome?
Just like how people consider Washington D.C. as a focal point of America’s power and influence, Rome symbolizes the power and influence that makes up its empire which stretched vastly across Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, including the regions of Judea where much of the New Testament narrative takes place.
This Roman Empire is often regarded as one of the most successful civilizations in human history. During the period of the Pax Romana, which means “Roman Peace” in Latin, the empire experienced centralized governance, economic prosperity, cultural flourishing, and relative stability — all the things we, humans, across time, hope for in their governments.
A key factor contributing to the period of the Pax Romana was the infrastructure developed under the reign of Caesar Augustus. During his forty-year rule, Augustus oversaw the construction of approximately fifty thousand miles of highways, creating an extensive network of roads that facilitated travel and communication. This network boosted trade, streamlined administration, and enabled the spread of ideas across the empire. Additionally, these roads allowed Roman legions to move swiftly, ensuring rapid responses to uprisings and external threats, thereby solidifying Rome’s control over its vast and diverse territories.
While the Pax Romana brought unprecedented peace and prosperity to Roman citizens, it came at a steep cost for many, particularly noncitizens and marginalized groups. High taxes were levied to sustain Rome’s massive military and ambitious infrastructure projects, disproportionately burdening conquered peoples and lower classes. Enslavement was widespread, with millions of individuals from conquered territories forced into servitude to fuel the empire’s economy and labor needs. Noncitizens lacked the legal protections and privileges of Roman citizens and were frequently exploited or oppressed under imperial rule. For many, the Pax Romana was not a time of peace but one of subjugation, inequality, and suffering under the heavy hand of empire.
Mary and Joseph were among those living under Roman occupation as Jews, part of the conquered peoples and noncitizens of the empire. And their journey to Bethlehem was not one of choice but of obligation, prompted by a decree from Caesar Augustus, calling for a census. And this census was a common tool of an empire, often used to increase tax revenues to support its vast ambitions.
So, imagine how these conquered people, including Mary and Joseph, felt as they trudged toward Bethlehem. There might have been a sense of helplessness as they complied with orders, knowing they had no choice. Perhaps there was skepticism and fear, wondering what new demands or hardships might further complicate their already difficult lives. Perhaps they felt resignation and complacency, accepting their reality that the only way to survive was to serve the empire without resistance. Or maybe they felt the weight of defeat and hopelessness, quietly echoing the psalmist’s cry: “How long, O Lord?” (Psalm 13).
Although we are no conquered people, perhaps we can relate to them in some way — especially to the feeling of helplessness before the forces that shape our lives. On a systemic level, we recognize policies and systems beyond our control that bring harm, prioritize profit over people, and perpetuate inequality or suffering, impacting countless lives, especially those who are marginalized and voiceless. On a personal level, we acknowledge forces that harm us and leave us feeling defeated, despite our deep longing for change — whether it be chronic illness, long-term addiction, destructive habits, abusive relationships, or loneliness. Scripture calls these forces, which operate on personal, systemic, and cosmic levels, “principalities and powers” (Eph 6:12). These forces can feel like chains of bondage and captivity, leaving us yearning for liberation and longing for a hope that can break through and set us free. This is the very starting point of our journey: Rome represents the seat of these principalities and powers, a place where “our hopes and fears are released and sometimes collide.” Thus, Advent begins with longing — longing for change, longing for freedom, longing for justice, longing for peace, longing for deliverance, longing for salvation, longing for the Savior.
Out of Israel’s longing for a Savior, Jesus Christ was born.
But that is only half of the Advent story.
The other half of the story is
that out of our longing for a Savior, Jesus Christ will come again.
Isn’t that the mystery of faith we proclaim?
Christ has died; Christ is risen; Christ will come again.
So, let me ask you:
The Apostle Paul speaks to our experience of longing in today’s scripture, written to the house churches in Rome who were expecting Jesus’ return within their lifetime. Their waiting for the coming of Christ met with the harsh reality of suffering. As you know, they were the church in Rome, the very seat of principalities and powers. Once again, in the midst of suffering, they longed for change, redemption, and restoration; they groaned for their Savior.
Paul writes to their experience, emphasizing that it is not just they but the whole creation that groans together for salvation, as if enduring the pains of labor. In other words, their shared suffering is not the end — it is a hopeful anticipation of new birth and new life. Although all they could see and feel now is indescribable pain, Paul encourages them to wait in eager longing and hope, for a wonderful gift of future glory is on the way.
And this expectant groaning of labor pains still applies to us today. We continue to wait in hopeful anticipation for new birth and new life, even in the face of the present sufferings in our world, which we experience and for which we intercede. And we remain hopeful because of the first fruits of the Spirit: the glimpses of God’s kingdom, the moments when the Holy Spirit moves among us, and the gifts of grace we witness every day through Christ. In other words, we remain hopeful because our God intercedes for us in our collective suffering.
Consider the glimpses of God’s kingdom, the moments when the Holy Spirit has moved among us, or the gifts of grace we have witnessed. These phrases often describe experiences that exceed our expectations and understandings. These capture divine surprises that defy our skepticism and cynicism. These embody the extraordinary love we receive from those who reflect Christ. These first-fruit experiences are what keep us hopeful in our suffering. And our state of hopefulness in labor pain produces in us not only trust and firmness in the faith, but also a different way of living. Through our words and actions, we reveal an alternative way of being in the world through sharing the gifts of the Spirit with those around us.
Again, I find Paul’s metaphor of labor pain brilliant. I remember being in a delivery room for almost twenty-four hours, being next to my wife as she endured intense pain and extreme fatigue. And we were there pushing for this baby to come out in hopeful anticipation, without any idea of what this baby would become, what gifts she would bring to our family, or how her presence would alter our lives.
As Paul writes in today’s scripture, hope that is seen is not hope, but we hope for what we do not see. And we do so with endurance, steadfastness, and perseverance — which are what the translated word patience tries to convey. I think this is both the most beautiful and frustrating part of our Christian journey: we do not hope for what is seen but for what we do not see. Our hope lies not in absolute certainty but in humble mystery. Our hope flourishes not in human preference but in divine imagination.
This is the very movement of our faith journey, revealed through the story of Advent. Out of Israel’s longing for a Savior, Jesus Christ was born in the most unexpected way possible — in a lowly manger as a helpless baby. Out of Creation’s longing for a Savior, Jesus brought salvation to us in the most unexpected way possible — through death on a cross and resurrection. Out of our longing for a Savior, Jesus has and will continue to reveal himself to us in unexpected ways. And out of the whole Creation’s longing for a Savior, we believe Jesus Christ will come again in the most unexpected way possible.
Dear church, let me ask you these questions once again:
Whenever we think about these things, we often wish — perhaps most of the time — that God would just act like a human empire, issuing decrees to put a swift end to our misery and all human sufferings. We wish God would just tell us imperatively what to do so we no longer have to deal with all these problems.
But, as the book On the Way to Bethlehem beautifully describes,¹
God does not decree. Rater, God births. God sends a baby, a Son. A Son who would be killed by the empire under which he was born, suffering a Roman crucifixion. Why? So that something new could be birthed in our hearts. Whatever change needs to happen in our world begins with our being born again. For what does creation wait for with eager longing? “For the revealing of the children of God.” [That’s] us, born again.
Despite how much we might wish the church could operate like an empire, the church is called to be more like a harvest field — patiently spreading the seeds of God’s kingdom in all soils, with hope that those seeds will sprout and grow in our hearts. Only then can we be born again, yielding a harvest of fruits to be shared with the world.
As we begin this Advent season, I pray that seeds of divine imagination take root in our hearts. May the story of Christmas be more than an occasion to revisit an old tale. May it become an invitation to leave behind our “Rome” with hopeful anticipation. As we draw closer to O little town of Bethlehem, may Christ be born anew in our hearts, and may we, too, be renewed and born again in Christ.
In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

What to read before your Italian adventure!
There can’t be a definitive list of books to read before going travelling to a glorious new destination, but I tried to find and read as many recommendations as I could before my trip to Florence and Rome, and here are the books that I found most enjoyable and interesting.
My top choice funnily enough, was from a series of books called Horrible Histories that I read when I was younger, and found that it had the most comprehensive whistle-stop tour of ancient Rome presented in an entertaining manner for a busy but curious traveller.
The Ruthless Romans is full of jokes, anecdotes, and important historical figures. It covers Ancient Rome from 1000 BC - 476 AD and is shockingly dense and informative for such an easy read. If you don’t have any time at all, try reading this on the plane to da Vinci airport.
Between the collapse of the Republic and start of the Roman Empire is a key piece that I read in high school: Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare. I don’t think you need to read Shakespeare before a trip, but if you like me have fond memories of sitting in class mesmerized by a political conflict written four centuries ago about a historical event from a couple of millennia ago, then you’ll remember the irony that in killing Caesar for his assumed monarchic intent, the Senate all but ensured that “another Caesar” would eventually take over Rome as its first emperor: Augustus.
To go off on another minor nostalgic tangent, if Shakespeare is too much of a commitment before a trip to Rome, Asterix hilariously covers the Roman campaigns that lead to the events in Julius Caesar.
For some real, serious history, these two were the most recommended:
Unfortunately I only managed to dip my toes in them before my trip and they were very dense and informative.
On a lighter note, I did breeze through Angels and Demons. It was an action-packed thriller that plays fast and loose with facts.
I liked that it covered Vatican City, which none of the previous books do, and touched on the works of Botticelli and Dante, who were both all over especially Florence and Rome.
For Florence, I’ve been reading The Enchantress of Florence that does an incredible job setting the stage for what the world was like in the 16th century and how interconnected Italy, Turkey, India and everything in between were by trade links and travellers.
Some other books by Italian authors and set in Italy that I didn’t have a chance to read but would like to in the future are:
And to throw it in there because it was everywhere, especially in Florence where Dante’s bones aren’t: The Divine Comedy.

The plan was to end the day at the Villa Borghese gardens, but with twenty more minutes of walking and legs already exhausted from a full day on foot, it didn’t seem worth it.
Instead, I stopped on a pedestrian terrace along the busy Via Frattina, not far from my hotel.
A glass of red wine, a seat outside, and a bit of people-watching paired with a book. It’s a great exercise to avoid reaching for your phone when you’re sitting alone.
The café held me for about half an hour, soaking in the buzz of the street and the taste of the wine.
Once the last sip of Italian red was gone, I headed back to the Bulgari hotel to get my power bank. Yes, I was staying at the Bulgari hotel, and no, I can’t afford it. That’s a story for another time.
As I approach the reception, five people in uniform turn to face me.
I ask if I can grab something from my bags, which were stored in the luggage room, and a beautiful young man smiles at me, “Of course. Follow me.”
We walk into the room, and he leads me to my things.
“Oh, so you don’t need this. You know which ones they are.” I say quietly, as I glance down…

Non-members of Medium can read the full article here.
I first visited Rome with my family a few years back. We were planning to do the main touristy things, but when faced with the endless queue in St Peter’s Square, we had a change of plan and a wander down to the river instead.
I’d not done much research for the trip, unusual for me, but I wasn’t organising it — my role was just to turn up and enjoy! So I had no idea what other attractions were within walking distance. But we were pretty sure there would be a cafe where we could sit and watch the world go by fairly close by.
We walked past the street sellers, their souvenirs spread out on tarpaulins, and approached the river. My attention was drawn to the building on my left, first the light stone walls, then the darker brick of the heart of the castle, and I was hit by the strangest feeling of déjà vu. I knew this building, it’s curved ramparts, the flagpole on top. But this was my first trip to Rome. Why was a place I’d never been to so familiar?

Rome might be it for me. The one. The city above all others. The one you find yourself Googling flights to late at night, even when you’ve just arrived home from your last trip.
I think we all have places like that.
A few months ago, I visited Rome for the fourth time. One of those times was a month-long trip and I can tell you, it was one of the highlights of my three-year-long travels. I never wanted to leave because Rome has exactly what I love in a city. Beauty. Atmosphere. And one of my favourite food and drink cultures in the world.
Yes, there are tourist traps. Yes, some places will give you a raw deal in bad pasta, bad pizza and bad wine. But there is also value to be found. You can find pizza that will do things to you. You can eat pasta that will ruin every other pasta you eat henceforth (it’s that good).
If you want to eat and drink well in this city, you’ve just got to know where to go.
Every day in Rome starts with a caffè and a maritozzo — Rome’s famous cream-filled…

LE CITOYEN — Ancient Rome is undoubtedly a civilisation to be looked upon. Albeit known for their ‘pagan extravagance,’ the ancient Romans did, however, conquer and create a nation state that ranged from the borders of Scotland to the deserts of Arabia, reaching its height in the 2nd century CE and influence modern western life more than any other ancient civilisation (alongside the Greeks). However, there are only a few good examples of films and TV series that depict Roman life as it should. Films such as Gladiator, despite its well-written plot, presented a lot of inaccuracies. Meanwhile, TV-series such as Spartacus were, well, rather vulgar — not saying that Roman society wasn’t like that — but for a historical TV show, it showed parts of Roman culture that should have been, let’s say, set behind curtains and exaggerated at that! However, one TV series has put me, as an avid enthusiast of all things Greco-Roman, to stop my various nitpicks and just sit down and enjoy. With an unbelievably stellar plot and deep research into Roman life, the HBO Series Rome (first launched in 2006), terribly underrated in comparison to the likes of Game of Thrones, is what I could say (and most historians do agree) a highly-authentic depiction of Roman life.
Albeit historians having pointed out a few inaccuracies (especially in the timeline), what HBO’s Rome brought was much better: authenticity. It immersed yourself into the world, made you care about the characters, and anxiously sit on your chair as you watch the series go on, waiting for what other secrets of Ancient Rome might be uncovered.
Overview
Over two seasons, the TV miniseries Rome follows Lucius Vorenus (played by Kevin McKidd) and Titus Pullo (played by Ray Stevenson), two soldiers of the Roman legion and therefore Roman citizens, as they go through turbulent times in Roman history. Vorenus and Pullo are both members of the plebeian class–or the common citizenry–of Rome back in the dying days of the Republic and so gives us a lot of new perspectives on ancient Roman life. While also following the high politics of Gaius Julius Caesar (played by Ciaran Hinds, who later featured in Game of Thrones as the wildling King, Mance Rayder), and his civil wars against Pompey, which is already a recurring theme as depicted by popular media, such as multiple films on the life of Caesar and most well-known the plays written by one William Shakespeare, it does not relieve us of the grit and severity of the common man’s life.
Historically, the Romans operated on a not-so-rigid class system dictated by ancestry and wealth. The three classes of Roman citizens, which are the Patricians, Equites (or Knights, who became important mid-level civil and military officials as well as cavalrymen), and Plebeians (common citizenry, who became tradesmen, merchants, artisans, rank-and-file soldiers), lived very different lives and worked different livelihoods. The Patricians, or the senatorial class, act as the primary ruling class during Republican times. Patrician families were allowed entry into the senate on the basis of their wealth and ancestry. Some Patrician families claim descent from the Gods (Caesar’s family, or the Julii Caesaris, claim their descent from the goddess Venus) despite their claim to a seat of senator is mostly based on their ancestry, drawing back to early or pre-Republican times. Famous senatorial “gentes” (or clans) include that of the Cornelii (for example, Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus, the victor of the Battle of Zama against Hannibal Barca in c. 202 BC), Junii (for example, the overthrower of the last King of Rome, Lucius Junius Brutus), the Porcii (Marcus Porcius Cato, famous Roman orator, though the younger one live in Caesar’s times).
Not surprisingly, descendants or the adopted benefactors of said gens lived in the timeframe depicted in Rome, represented by members of the Optimate faction, which consisted of traditionalist Roman senators who wanted to preserve oligarchic rule in defence of Republican institutions, including Scipio Metellus, Marcus Junius Brutus (descendant of said Brutus, played by Tobias Menzies, later as Edmure Tully in Game of Thrones), Gaius Cassius Longinus, and Marcus Porcius Cato the Younger, all serving under the charismatic brilliance of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, Caesar’s once-ally and nemesis. These characters go up against, in the damnably byzantine politics and battlefields of antiquity, the Populares faction, with Gaius Julius Caesar at its head, and Marcus Antonius (popularly known in his anglicised form of ‘Mark Antony,’ depicted as a fantasist, narcissist, brutal and temperamental soldier by Antony Purefoy’s brilliant acting) by his side.
The two main protagonists, Centurion Lucius Vorenus and Legionary Titus Pullo, are members of the Roman Thirteenth Legion, of whom Caesar led through his long Gallic wars. Rome goes through the plebeian lives of the two soldiers, introducing not only events in history, but also of Roman culture through daily life, something I found very interesting. As there are too many aspects of Roman life depicted within the HBO Series (and thus the corresponding budget, which was the reason why it was cancelled after its second season), we will take it from a few aspects and how every film set in a historical background or piece of literary fiction should take into account to bring said world into life.
Traditions and Religion
Roman religion and tradition is deeply ingrained within its society. Notably, the Roman state and religion were never seen as two different things by Roman society. The various cults and sects of the Roman pantheon, along with the various deities of Jupiter (the king of the gods, lord of the sky and thunder), Dis (god of the underworld, most notably used by soldiers and fighters especially in damning a certain thing), and even Vesta were depicted with superlative detail. Note the sacrifices conducted in some episodes, the reading of omens, the praying to small figurines in a homely shrine, and the entry of one of Vorenus’ daughter into the Vestal Virgins later on in the season.
The Vestal Virgins themselves were one of the most interesting parts of Roman tradition and religion; they were selected from highborn women at a very young age to enter priesthood and vowed to be chaste for the next 30 years in order to cultivate the sacred fire, located in the temple of Vesta. Vesta herself was the Roman goddess of the hearth, marked by the existence of Vesta’s sacred fire which must not be let out under any circumstances. Superstition was, that if the fire died, it meant that the goddess had abandoned her protection of Rome–meaning that the infernal city itself was under grave danger.
Aside from religion, Rome also depicted many other Roman traditions, such as the patricians’ obscene eating habits of lying down on sofa-like furniture while conversing and getting absolutely drunk as well as exceptionally extravagant, drug-filled orgies. One other interesting event in Rome was the marking of the coming-of-age. Every male Roman citizen was given the right to wear a toga at the age of sixteen (or seventeen, depending on which is closest to 15 March of the year) and therefore participate as adults in civil society. The depiction of Octavian’s (the future Roman Emperor Augustus) coming-of-age rite of passage was depicted at the near-end of season one, something that would drastically change his way of thought and vibrate his transition from boy to man so visible in the transition of seasons.
Also quite interesting was the portrayal of tradesman guilds. In the series, the Herald (the rather bulky fellow with iconic hand gestures) in the forum of Rome mentions in an ‘advertisement’ of sorts, the Roman Guild of Bakers, while mention of guilds of smiths of some sort took place throughout the series.
Aside from Roman religion, Jews were also featured. Timon (Lee Boardman), one of the supporting characters, is depicted as a cutthroat sellsword serving Atia of the Julii (Polly Walker), in more than one way. He is dragged in a conspiracy when the Tetrarch of Galilee (Jewish Royalty) arrives in Rome for ‘adminsitrative business.’
Military Service and Tactics
Military service was a large part of Roman life. Soldiering was considered honourable and serving Rome was, after all, a citizen’s unwritten obligation. In the dying days of the Republic, the Romans had already established a professional volunteer army (in comparison to levied troops, which was the system that prevailed up into the 18th century), allowing the fighting of successive wars all across her borders and the gradual expansion of the Pax Romana. Citizen-soldiers like Pullo and Vorenus were obliged with 20 years’ service and were entitled to a percentage of booty and war prizes. After retirement, ‘old legionaries’ may sign up again to become evocati, or veteran troops, serving as the crack troops held in reserve in battles, who earned multiple times the wage of a normal soldier and were immune to menial duties. This took place when Vorenus decided to take Mark Antony’s offer to join his army as a ‘Prefect of the Evocati Cohort,’ a traditionally equestrian position, of which Vorenus had achieved (Equestrian status was achievable after the ownership of 10,000 sesterces in assets, after all). He also had to go through an interesting rite of passage to get it.
Roman military tactics were depicted according to commentaries of the time, such as the Comentarii de Bello Gallico by Caesar. Roman legionaries fought in close formation, standardly going in formation 10-across and 8-deep (in a rectangular formation of 80 men each, called a century). With shields raised, legionaries covered their sectors, and watched for each other. Upon a certain amount of time, the centurion would blow a whistle to signify the change of the foremost front man, and the first-ranker quickly switched to the man behind him. This allowed equal distribution of the fighting, thus allowing Roman legionaries to fight longer than their counterparts. This was depicted well in the opening scene (perhaps the Battle of Alesia) and the epic Battle of Phillipi (in the second series) between Brutus and the second Triumvirate (Octavian Caesar, Antony, and Lepidus). Uniforms and arms were also accurate to the era, with the Roman soldiers wearing in variation of military tunics in scarlet and off-white (undyed) colours, while wearing lorica hamata or mail cuirass, instead of the inaccurately portrayed lorica segmentata (segmented plate armour cuirass) often used in games and films. This type of armour was not used in the time of Caesar, however, and came in the later Imperial period of the first century to third century AD, in limited use. The ‘square’ Roman shield (scutum), the pilum and pila (throwables or javelins), and the gladius hispanensis (Spanish sword), the Celt-inspired republican helmet (galea) along with the not-so-famous Roman sarcina, or luggage, which each legionary brought their own, were also pictured widely.
Turmoil and Squalor
Viewers could often see the tough-living, dirty, and ragged streets of Rome, then one of the most populous and advanced cities throughout the Mediterranean. Even the home of the Vorenii, where Lucius Vorenus and his family lived, was not as fancy as one would think of the ‘extravagant’ Romans. Many of the citizens of Rome lived in poverty and in a state of squalor; murder was not uncommon, and gang fights over disputes were perhaps the way most citizens preferred it to be finished. Courts of law did exist in Rome, but not really portrayed within the TV series.
Another interesting fact was that the Romans often used grafitti to express themselves. Naturally, due to this, the walls of the small streets in Rome were decorated with entertaining, and sometimes perverse, pictures courtesy of Your Fellow Citizen.
Clothing and Fashion
Roman society also had its dress codes. Formal occasions were marked by the wearing of the toga (broad, purple-stripe for senators, two stripes for equestrian/knights, and a plain white for plebeians) for men, although in day-to-day life, a tunic–a piece of cloth that went down to above the knees–were worn. For the regular citizen, these tunics were mostly plain and sometimes dyed, though for nobility, the tunic was often decorated with embroidery to display status. The Romans did live by the code ‘you are what you wear’–perhaps something that lives down to Italians today.
For women, the stola was the most common dress, in tandem with the toga. Stolae were somehow a timeless piece, with variations worn from the times of the mid-republic (3rd century BC) up to the late Byzantine Empire (15th century AD). Women who wore the stola were seen as graceful and honourable, and this was depicted in the various forms of the stola, from a light, near-transparent garment to the rich deep red and/or other colours of whatever Atia of the Julii (a depiction of a woman of extravagance) wore throughout the series. Stola were mostly worn by married women, to display modesty and maturity. Younger women often wore tunics inspired by the Greek chiton (as were many parts of Roman culture).
Despite in a short space of two seasons, it was remarkable how much of ancient Rome was able to be portrayed by the series. The antics of Titus Pullo, the stoicism of Lucius Vorenus, the extravagance of Mark Antony, the grace and shrewdness of Cleopatra, the smart power-plays of Caesar, and the idealism of Brutus were all depicted well within Rome. Although it was cancelled, it had managed to amaze many ancient history enthusiasts with its authenticity and exploration of each character through personal and interpersonal conflicts. If you want to create a period drama, just write for fun, or want to binge watch something exceptionally, and I say again, exceptionally, good, Le Citoyen highly recommends HBO’s Rome.
Plus, if you’re waiting for Game of Thrones’ final season, and want to watch a series of a such (but based on real events), go watch it. Wherever you can. Go! Go!
Salutations.

Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus.
I know what you’re thinking.
What a name!
I agree.
Sadly, the man with this name is responsible for a lot of naughty nonsense.
First off, he murdered his own mother.
If that wasn’t enough, he also murdered his first wife.
And his second wife?
Kicked her to death while she was pregnant.
Yeah, we’re dealing with a monstrosity.
Sadly, his cruelty wasn’t just reserved for his close family members.
He also used to host parties where he’d light people on fire (usually Christians) while he and his guests would frolic to fiddle music.
All while, Rome was engulfed in flames.
The guy was a psycho.
And in this article, I’m going to go all in on the lad known as Nero: Rome’s most notorious emperor.
Nero was the fifth Roman emperor, ruling from 54 AD to 68 AD.

Helpful hints on how to have a miserable but interesting time in the Eternal City.
Listen, I love Rome. I really do but now that we’re more or less free to travel again, I feel compelled to fill you in on the Eternal City. Masochists will love it. So will anybody else drawn to stress and anxiety. Don’t get me wrong, Rome has a lot of things going for it. Historical buildings, pizza, magnificent museums, pizza, stunning churches, pizza. Did I say pizza? Over four million tourists a year visit the Eternal City and, for the most part, Rome is prepared. Yet there are a few trouble spots that can turn a Roman holiday into a Roman nightmare.
Rome is always crowded and those walking tours led by tour guides with flags or umbrellas only make things worse. These human centipedes shuffle, and I do mean shuffle, along the sidewalk and hold up the rest of us with places to go. They’re everywhere but particularly dense around the Vatican Museum and the Trevi Fountain. Especially the Tevi. The Fountain is hemmed in by narrow streets that funnel pedestrians into the site like sheep to the slaughter. Good luck with getting a clear view. Keep in mind there are equally…

Book Review: Are We Rome? The Fall of an Empire and the Fate of America by Cullen Murphy,https://medium.com/@desireewinns/book-review-are-we-rome-the-fall-of-an-empire-and-the-fate-of-america-by-cullen-murphy-6ba9c929abf2,"Sign up

Is America the new Roman Empire, and if so, will it meet the same fate? This book argues that America and Rome are similar in terms of their psychology and soft power, from the way Washington and Rome view themselves as the center of their worlds, to the global and historical impacts of their cultures. In the beginning, Murphy notes Freud’s comparison of the human psyche and the ruins of Rome, the possibility of histories existing simultaneously rather than one after the other. It’s a theme that runs throughout each chapter as Murphy compares the militaries, borders, people, and cultures of Rome and America. Considering how much Roman culture and iconography shape the ways Americans symbolize and discuss their own power, it really does seem like Rome and America exist together. However, Murphy posits that America’s capability for relatively rapid social transformation (especially in just two centuries) is what separates it from its doomed predecessor, and what will save it from the same fate. I’d pick this book up if you’re interested in learning how the cultural and psychological power of empires expands beyond centuries. In the end you’ll definitely wonder if Rome ever did fall.

Rome is a city of amazing pizza, pasta, and gelato, but if you’re looking for a healthy break from all those delicious carbs, here are 4 great places where you can get fresh juices and smoothies:
Esco Sazio — This adorable little shop offers completely organic juices and smoothies, in addition to healthy sandwiches and salads. Swing on one of their wooden swings as you drink your juice and enjoy the chalkboard-meets-chandelier ambiance. Our girls loved the chocolate banana protein smoothie, and I enjoyed my tropical juice with pineapple and guava.
Via dei Banchi Vecchi, 135, 00186 Roma, Italy
Pronto — We stumbled across this restaurant in Rome’s Monti neighborhood, near the Colosseum, and stopped in when we saw their “fresh juices” sign. Their fruit is freshly chopped, juiced, and blended (if you get juice with pears in it) right in front of you, and the three juices that we tried were all fantastic. You can take your juice outside and hang out at the fountain with the locals while you drink it and take in the area’s energetic vibe.
Via dei Serpenti, 163, Roma
Aromaticus — This restaurant is also in the trendy Monti area, and they serve fresh juices and clean, mostly raw and unprocessed foods (salads, hummus, beef tartare, etc.). The shop itself is cute and hip, decorated with vintage cookbooks and selling potted herbs and gardening supplies, and the food and juice are excellent. The pineapple-mint juice was one of the best juices I’ve ever had, so perfectly sweet and delicious, and Joshua loved his Greek salad with pita bread, hummus, cherry tomatoes, olives, and feta cheese.
Via Urbana, 134, 00184 Roma, Italy
AllBiOne — Self-described as “organic street food”, AllBiOne serves organic juices, cut-up fresh fruit, and 14 different kinds of organic meatballs… everything from beef and tomato or chicken and curry to vegetarian eggplant parmesan or ricotta and pecorino cheese balls. Everything we ate was tasty, but I highly recommend the cheese “meat”balls, and the juices we got were fresh and delicious.
The restaurant is a short walk from the Colosseum, and the owner is really friendly — he overheard us talking about wanting strawberries in a juice for the girls, and he offered to make a strawberry-apple-orange juice for them that wasn’t listed on the board; it turned out to be perfect for them!
Largo Corrado Ricci, 34, Roma, Italy
Do you know another great juice bar in Rome? Leave a comment and share it with us!

We had been waiting 30 minutes for the tour to begin. Stepping into a small spot of shade, I wiped the sweat from my face. It was only 10:30, and already the temperature had soared to 95.
“I thought this tour was supposed to start at 10,” I grumbled to my husband, who was also angling for shade.
“It was also supposed to be a private tour,” he said. “But there are 19 of us.”
My husband and I like private tours when we travel, to avoid the sort of scenario we were currently experiencing. Group tour guides are informative and engaging, but there are always tourists who can’t keep up, want to cut the excursion short, or show up late.
Today, two people hadn’t shown up. The excursion was supposed to be a nine-hour walking tour of Rome, and I was ready to get started. Our guide, an Italian woman with thick, black hair and a round face flushed with heat, tried to keep the 19 tourists in our group cheerful.
“Just a few more minutes. I believe the late ones are coming,” she chirped, forcing a smile. “Ah! Here they are!”
I watched as two grumpy blonde women trudged through the crowd towards our group. One was youngish, her expression…

As is well-known, Rome was founded by the legendary brothers Romulus and Remus, who originated from Alba Longa and belonged to one of the Latin tribes. However, as Rome grew into a vast and powerful state, the Romans decided having only local Italian shepherds among their ancestors wasn’t very prestigious. It would be much cooler if the Romans descended from a well-known, celebrated people in legends, even better — from a great hero. And they found such a heroic ancestor. He was Aeneas, a hero from Troy who left his homeland after the city’s fall.
This legend did not immediately become widely accepted among the Romans. The 1st-century BC Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus presents three versions of the Roman origins he knew: Italy, Libya, and Greece. In the last case, he refers to Greek colonists who had long lived on the Apennine Peninsula. However, Dionysius favored the view that the Romans were of mixed Greek-Italian origin. At the same time, Dionysius mentions the Roman version that Romulus and Remus were sons of Aeneas, implying that Rome was built by the second generation of Trojan refugees.

Celebrating the Western tradition, from Romulus to Rembrandt.

The traditional story of Rome’s founding is a classic tale, one that every schoolchild used to learn. One of the greatest civilizations of the Western world, Rome shaped our modern society more than any other ancient culture (with the possible exception of Greece). To understand the incredible story — somewhat dubious historicity aside — is to gain insight into the folklore and heritage that have inspired twenty-five centuries of thinkers, creators, rulers, and ordinary people who looked backwards at the mistakes and achievements of the past for wisdom and direction in the present.
Many charge that learning such tales in the Digital Age is anachronistic at best and exclusionary at worst. But there is undeniably something transcendent about them, a special quality that explains Rome’s unique ability to capture the hearts and souls of luminaries from every time and place, from Dante to Gibbon to Toni Morrison.
Studying the history of ancient Rome ought not to be an exercise in self-flagellation, in which one allows the often-savage realities of the ancient world to overshadow the innovations and triumphs of an extraordinary time. Instead, it ought to be a celebration of the grandeur that was Rome, imperfections and all, and a recognition of the seminal role she played in shaping the West.
And so without further ado I present the traditional and mythological history of Ancient Rome from its founding to its fall in three parts.
On April 21, 753 BC, the twins Romulus and Remus stood atop a rather unremarkable Italian hillock — it was known as the “Palatine” — and founded a small settlement that would rise to become one of the most dominant and lasting empires in world history. This ten-part survey briefly traces the traditional and legendary history of Rome, over the course of which I shall attempt to answer the crucial question: how did a diminutive encampment on the Palatine rise to global dominance, and what became of its grandeur?
Our story begins at Troy. According to legend, in the 1200s BC a titanic struggle was waged between the Greeks and the Trojans, inhabitants of a city known as Troy upon the Dardanelles in modern-day Turkey. The cause of the war was divine; three of the most prominent goddesses in the Greek pantheon (Hera, queen of the gods; Athena, goddess of wisdom; and Aphrodite, goddess of sexual love) found themselves in the midst of a passionate disagreement over who was the most beautiful. To settle their dispute, Zeus (king of the gods) appointed Paris, a Trojan prince, as judge. Attempting to sway Paris, each of the three goddesses offered him a precious reward should he choose her, but it was Aphrodite’s offer — that he be wed to Helen, wife of a Greek king called Menelaus — that was most convincing to the Trojan squire. Her promise was swiftly delivered upon, and Helen was spirited away from the court of Menelaus to the high walls of Priam, king of Troy.
War followed forthwith, as Greeks hastened to Troy to support Menelaus and reclaim his snatched wife from Paris. The fighting was intense, lengthy, and heroic — much of it is retold in Homer’s Iliad, most especially the exploits of a Greek general named Achilles. At last, supported by many of the gods and aided by cunning trickery in the “Trojan Horse” (a fake peace offering that in fact contained Greek soldiers within its belly, allowing the marauders to flood the city by night and open its gates to the invaders waiting outside), the Greeks breached the walls, and began to pillage and burn.
From the carnage escaped a particular Trojan prince — Aeneas, a son of Venus — accompanied by a retinue of comrades. In search of friendly lands and a place to found a new city, he set out from Troy by ship and, after an arduous journey, arrived on the shores of North Africa to a city called Carthage (modern-day Tunis), the home of Queen Dido. The people were friendly, milk and honey flowed, and, most notoriously, Dido and Aeneas fell into the throngs of love for one another, a rather scandalous affair for the previously-unbetrothed Dido and the now-uxorious Aeneas. Alas, this was not to be the Romans’ final home; for Hermes, the messenger god, flitted down to Aeneas, whom he found strutting bejeweled atop the high walls of Carthage, and bore to him a fateful message from Zeus himself: Aeneas must head to Latium (the region of Italy around modern-day Rome), as was his fate. Immediately, devoted Aeneas (or pius Aeneas, as goes the famous Latin phrase) set out, and soon reaches Latium. However, his departure was not casualty-free; in a fit of woeful despair at seeing her lover gone, Dido stabbed herself to death, leaving a final curse on the Trojans that shall reappear later in this survey. Much of the tale of Aeneas’ journey to Rome, it should be noted, is retold in Vergil’s Aeneid.
Thus we conclude the first chapter of Rome’s history, with Trojan ships on Latian sands.
Having shored in Italy, “Aeneas f[ound] not peace but another terrible war” (Ragan, Survey). A local king, Latinus, sparked conflict when he betrothed his daughter Lavinia to the newly arrived Aeneas instead of the man to whom he had already promised her, Turnus. In the ensuing strife, in which the Trojan-Latinus coalition fought Turnus and his local allies, Aeneas slew Turnus and subsequently married Lavinia. He died in another skirmish shortly afterward.
Aeneas’ body was never recovered, but his name remains forever etched into the towering stele of Western civilization, a fleeting ember of once-mighty Troy rekindled into the blazing inferno that was Rome. His legacy would be taken up by his young son Ascanius (also known as Iulus). The year, as legend has it, is circa 1175 BC.
Thirty or so years later, Ascanius founded the town of Alba Longa in the nearby Alban Hills, about twenty miles east of the Seven Hills that will later mark the famous site of Rome. Ascanius is the first in a 400-year line of Alban kings — the so-called Silvian Dynasty — that ends with King Proca and his two sons: Numitor (the elder) and Amulius (the younger). Upon Proca’s death sometime in the 8th century BC, Numitor, being the elder brother, ought to have inherited the throne. Amulius, however, had other plans, and he usurped the throne, murdered Numitor’s sons, and cast Numitor himself into exile. In a rather Machiavellian twist, wanting to end his brother’s bloodline Amulius forced Numitor’s daughter Rhea Silvia to become a Vestal Virgin, consigning her to celibate priestesshood.
Divine intervention followed forthwith, and Rhea Silvia became impregnated by Mars, the god of war [virgin pregnancies tend to resurface, no?]. Amulius orders the products of the pregnancy, twin boys named Romulus and Remus, to be left on the banks of the Tiber River to perish [cue Moses…]. Escaping doom, the twins were found and nursed by a she-wolf who brought them to a cave known as “the Lupercal.” Soon thereafter, the infants were found by a shepherd, Faustulus, who took them in and raised them as his own (along with his wife, Acca Larentia). Eventually, having discovered their family background and having learned of the injustice Amulius had wrought, they wrested back control of Alba Longa and restored Numitor, their now-agéd grandfather, to the throne. Wrongs thus righted, the brothers set out, looking to found a city of their own.
The twins and their followers journeyed west to a marshy spot near the Tiber River, ringed by seven hills: the Palatine, the Quirinal, the Viminal, the Esquiline, the Caelian, the Aventine, and the Capitoline. Romulus surmounted the Palatine hill and began setting the boundaries of a new hamlet, Rome. The legendary date of this founding is April 21, 753 B.C. Remus, in brotherly scorn, leapt over the Rome’s diminutive walls. Romulus, ever the patriot, felled his brother with his blade, declaring, “Sic deinde, quicumque alius transiliet moenia mea” — “Thus henceforth to anyone who should o’erleap my bulwarks.”
Rid of pesky Remus, Romulus set to the task of governance and growth, making Rome (specifically the Capitoline hill) an asylum that welcomed all who wished to join the new town. Unsurprisingly, such an arrangement attracted a less-than-ideal rabble — the men were raucous and criminal, the women sparse. Stung by a neighboring tribe’s refusal to provide their daughters in marriage to the Roman ruffians, Romulus announced a Festival of Neptune (the sea god) in his new town, attracting scores of local tribespeople. With the beady eyes of the Romans fixed upon the Sabine daughters — the young, gallivanting women from the Sabine tribe — Romulus gave the signal, and the Romans rushed out from their hidey-holes, each seizing a Sabine lass for his own and absconding back onto the fortified heights of the Palatine. The festival, needless to say, quickly dispersed.
The Roman snatching — or, as it became known, “The Rape of the Sabine Women” — was rather poorly received by the duped Sabines, who quickly armed themselves and prepared to make battle. Skirmishes ensued, but the final engagement of the war, the Battle of the Lacus Curtius, was ended when the Roman wives (yes, the very Sabine girls who had only recently been kidnapped) threw themselves into the fray and demanded that conflict cease in an event often called “The Intervention of the Sabine Women.” Impelled to peace, the two towns merged, the new entity jointly ruled by Romulus and Titus Tatius, the king of the Sabines.
Around this time Romulus went about planting the societal seeds that would sprout into the grand trunks of Roman civilization. To one hundred hand-picked followers he gave the title “patres” — “fathers”. These men would serve in an official capacity as his advisory council, the Senate. The descendants of these early “fathers” would later be known as the “patricii,” or “Patricians.” The rest of the citizenry were merely the “plebs,” or “Plebeians.” From the union of these two delineated strata (the Senate and the masses) comes the famous phrase SPQR — “Senatus PopulusQue Romanus,” or “the Senate and People of Rome.” Another division of the city — thirty “curiae,” named after thirty of the Sabine women who had intervened — provided the voting units of the “Comitia Curiata,” or “Roman Assembly.”
Over the next several years of his rule (by now Titus Tatius had perished during a riot in nearby Lavinium, leaving Romulus the sole king), Romulus oversaw the city’s continued growth as it pressed outward in conquest. In the late 8th century B.C., Romulus died when, while surveying the troops arranged on the Campus Martius (Plain of Mars) from the Quirinal hill, a cloud enshrouded him. When the cloud lifted, Romulus was nowhere to be found — either murdered in a conspiracy by the Senators or, as the Roman historian Livy more dubiously asserts, ascended to heaven under the auspices of Mars. Romulus was later deified under the name “Quirinus,” attracting a significant cult following. He reigned for thirty-seven years, the first of Rome’s “Seven Kings.”
Thus we conclude the second chapter of our history of Rome, with Romulus dead and a new king, as we shall soon see, poised to spring from the ashes.
Somewhat unusually, the Roman kingship was elective: The Senate nominated new kings during the interregna that followed monarchs’ deaths (during which nominating process various Senators would serve as temporary rulers), and the Assembly confirmed or rejected those nominees. The arrangements surrounding Romulus’ succession were no exception; the lengthy, one-year interregnum that followed Romulus’ death saw ten Senators rule as interregnes, or “between-kings,” before a worthy successor was nominated and confirmed: Numa Pompilius, Rome’s second king.
Numa Pompilius: The Pacifist and Priest (r. 716–673 BC)
Numa’s accession betokened a city exhausted from the constant conflict and rapid expansion of Romulus’ reign: more scholar than fighter, Numa was famed for his disciplined lifestyle, religious dedication, and vast wisdom. Numa’s selection marked a successful compromise between the Roman and Sabine factions of the population — though himself a Sabine himself from the town of Cures, Numa was uncontroversial and widely respected, characteristics that rendered him acceptable to each of the bickering factions.
Numa is chiefly remembered for his pacifism and his institution of the sacra, Rome’s religious traditions. Among his first decrees as monarch was the dissolution of the guard that had comprised Romulus’ personal entourage — an act both of peacemaking and self-preservation, as the guards’ loyalty was questionable. One of Numa’s most significant contributions was the establishment of several priestly orders, including pontifices and flamines (higher and lower classes, respectively, of standard priests), the Salii (the twelve so-called “leaping priests” of Mars), the fetiales (the priests who advised the Senate on treaties, foreign affairs, and official declarations of war), and the Pontifex Maximus, the high priest of Rome. Most significantly, he imported from Alba Longa the Vestal Virgins — the famed priestesses of Vesta (goddess of the hearth) who, as ceremonial stewards of all Rome, kept her sacred fire aflame. Numa also constructed several temples, including the famous Temple of Janus, whose doors were closed during peacetime and flung open during wars. Tellingly, the doors remained closed for Numa’s entire reign. Another of his lasting contributions was the institution of a twelve-month calendar adjusted to the solar and lunar years, with provisions for “holy” and “unholy” days.
Throughout his reign, Numa asserted his direct connection to the gods by means of his marriage to Egeria, a nymph who supposedly furnished him with divine directives upon his periodic visits to her. Numa died of old age in 673 BC, having presided over a long period of peace and productivity in the city on the Tiber.
Tullus Hostilius: The Warrior (r. 673–642 BC)
Where Numa was priest, Tullus was warrior. Scornful of the religious obsession that had settled over the city and believing Rome to have grown “soft” under Numa’s pacifism, Tullus Hostilius set about renewing the military prowess the city had enjoyed under Romulus and sought to expand its imperium, or “sphere of influence” (later “empire”). Tullus waged war on several neighboring peoples, including the Sabines (whom he defeated with a cavalry charge in a battle near Malitiosa Forest, inflicting heavy casualties), the confederated Veientes and Fidenates (whom he defeated even despite the treacherous retreat of Rome’s Alban “allies”), and even Alba Longa, the ancient birthplace of Romulus. It is this final conquest for which Tullus is best known today.
Cattle begat the strife. When a small herd of the beasts (owned by a Roman farmer) wandered into Alban territory, and the relevant landowners refused to return them to Rome, Tullus did what any reasonable leader might have done: He declared war against all Alba Longa. Undaunted, the Albans marshaled themselves under their king, Cluilius, and marched to the outskirts of Rome. Quickly, they dug a trench — the aptly-named Cluilian trench — around the entire city. Soon, though, Cluilius perished of unspecified causes. [“Cluilius… moritur,” the Roman historian Livy helpfully elaborates: “Cluilius dies” (Ab Urbe Condita, 1.23.4).]
To replace Cluilius, the Albans appointed Mettius Fufetius as military dictator, granting him absolute command over the city and its forces. The two leaders — Tullus and Fufetius — drew up their armies into battle and marched out to face each other. Neither side wanting to wage what would surely be a bloody and destructive war — for the neighboring Etruscans would have looked on with glee as their two main territorial rivals tore each other to shreds, ready to swoop in and conquer the weakened victor — Fufetius suggested a more efficient resolution: a duel. Miraculously, each army had among its ranks a set of triplets: the Romans had the Horatii brothers, and the Albans had the Curiatii brothers. The teams of brothers would fight to the bloody death for their countries, and Tullus and Fufetius each entered into solemn vows pledging that they would abide by the outcome of the fight. I borrow from Ragan’s Survey to recount the conflict that ensued:
The contest was exciting: with two Horatians slain, but all three Curiatians wounded, the surviving Horatius began to flee! The Romans no doubt groaned, thinking their champion a coward. But there was method in this. For as he ran, he succeeded in separating the pursuing Curiatii whom he was able to fight individually and each of whom he killed. So, the Albans surrendered themselves and their town. The Romans, however, characteristic of these early wars, took the Albans as a whole into their citizen body; the town was destroyed — except for the temples — so that the Albans would become fully a part of their new community.
So, with that, Romulus’ hometown was no more, living on only in the memory of its now-Roman residents. A final finishing twist to conclude the conflict: the Alban dictator, Fufetius, soon proved a treacherous man. In the aforementioned Roman war against the Fidenates, it was he who pulled the Albans back from the fight, intending to linger in the backdrop until a winner was evident, at which point he would march out in “victory,” pretending to have supported whoever won. But Tullus was no fool: perceiving Fufetius’ treachery, he bade his calvary raise their spears, shielding the retreating Alban “allies” from view of his infantry and thus keeping the Roman morale intact, preserving Rome’s shot at victory. After the battle, Tullus punished Fufetius (also known by his first name, Metius) as he saw fit. I leave it to Vergil to recount the gory details of Metius’ death as he is ripped limb from limb by four horses (Aeneid Book VIII, tr. John Dryden):
Near this, the traitor Metius, stretch’d betweenFour fiery steeds, is dragg’d along the green,By Tullus’ doom: the brambles drink his blood,And his torn limbs are left the vulture’s food.
In addition to these military conquests, Tullus is notable for his construction of a new Senate building — the Curia Hostilia — which lasted for over 500 years after his death.
Alas, for all his military grandeur Tullus had neglected to honor the gods, and soon the city was afflicted with plague and famine as recompense for his scanty religiosity. Desperate, Tullus turned to the writings of his predecessor Numa, the expert on all things divine, and frantically yet inaccurately attempted to perform the rituals described therein. The gods, in no mood to tolerate such tomfoolery, struck Tullus with a thunderbolt, setting both him and his palace alight and bringing an end to his 31-year rule.
Ancus Marcius: The Builder (r. 640–616 BC)
Perhaps weary again of conflict and conquest, the Romans chose the more subdued Ancus Marcius — grandson of Numa — as their fourth king. Where Tullus had erred in the eyes of the gods, Ancus charted a safer course: his first act as king was to have the religious rites laid down by Numa copied down and displayed to the public, lest they ever again be ill-performed.
By Ancus’ time, Rome had become a profitable and well-positioned town controlling a respectable portion of Latium, the territorial region around the city. The city lay along the Via Salaria, or Salt Road, an ancient trading route that proved a welcome boon to the growing city. Taking advantage of the city’s strategic position, Ancus sent out a colonia (colony) of citizens to found Ostia at the mouth of the Tiber, a crucial expedition that secured the surrounding salt flats (providing a reliable revenue stream for the fledgling city) and extended Roman territory to the sea. He constructed the first bridge across the Tiber, the Pons Sublicius (Sublician Bridge), in 642 BC. The continued arrival of Etruscans from the north, skilled engineers in masonry, road construction, and swamp drainage, further complemented Ancus’ infrastructure projects. He built Rome’s first prison, the Mamertine Prison (which, in the following centuries, housed a number of high-profile prisoners, including Vercingetorix, Jugurtha, St. Peter, and Sejanus), atop the Capitoline hill. He fortified the Janiculum hill on the west bank of the Tiber, dug a ditch fortification (the Fossa Quiritium) on the city’s landward side, and constructed Rome’s first aqueduct.
Though more peaceful than his predecessor, Ancus did not shrink from conflict; he fought against the Latins, conquering the town of Politorum (whose residents were relocated to the base of the Aventine hill in Rome) — and later reconquering and destroying it when it was re-settled by more Latin peoples — along with Tellenae, Ficana, and Medullia, a conquest that brought loot to the coffers of Ancus and resettled Latins to the base of the Palatine hill. These resettlements, along with a growing population and increasing social stratification, helped form the early stages of the plebeian class at Rome. Furthermore, he expanded Roman territory into the Maesian Forest, seizing it from the Veientes.
After 24 years of successful rule, Ancus, the last of Rome’s Latin-Sabine kings, died, bringing to a close a period of economic and territorial expansion, infrastructure development, and social growth for the adolescent town on the banks of the Tiber.
Thus we conclude the third chapter of our brief history of Rome, with four successful kings etched into the people’s memory and new rulers from the north poised to take the throne.
During the reign of Ancus Marcius (640–616 BC), a talented man named Lucomo arrived from Etruria, a civilization to the north of Rome, with his wife, Tanaquil. Lucomo brought his peoples’ skill in engineering, stonework, and logistics; Tanaquil, their prowess in omen interpretation. According to tradition, this power couple was destined for greatness from the moment of their arrival at Rome: As they approached the city, an eagle swooped down, stole Lucomo’s hat, and quickly replaced it. Tanaquil, the “impartial” wife and observer, deemed this an omen of his future greatness.
Biased as it was, Tanaquil’s observation soon came to fruition. At Rome, Lucomo took the name “Lucius Tarquinius” (“Priscus,” meaning “Elder,” was later added — we shall soon see why), gained access to the city’s high society through favor and courtesy, and, eventually, became a friend of the aging Ancus. So close an associate of Ancus’ was he that the king named him guardian of his two sons, both mere youths. But this was a decision that would prove fatal for the line of poor Ancus.
With old Ancus on his deathbed in 616 BC, crafty Tarquin (or, more likely, the ambitious Tanaquil) sent the two sons on a lengthy hunting expedition. When Ancus died shortly thereafter, Tarquin leapt into action, making a case for his own election to the kingship before the Curiate Assembly (the thirty-tribe popular assembly presided over by the king — recall the thirty curiae named after the intervening Sabine women), a case he bolstered with bribery. Needless to say, he succeeded: The two sons, away on their jolly hunt, were exiled, and Lucius Tarquinius Priscus — better known by the anglicized Tarquin the Elder — became Rome’s fifth king.
L. Tarquinius Priscus: The Engineer (r. 616–579 BC)
Scurrilous accession aside, Tarquin oversaw a period of necessary construction, military success, and effective reform in the Eternal City. Though often overtowered by the whirlwind of reforms wrought by Servius Tullius, his successor, Tarquinius Priscus’ fruitful reign ought not be overlooked.
Many of his engineering projects became the defining monuments of Rome. He built the Circus Maximus (a chariot-racing arena) at the base of the Palatine hill; he laid the foundation for the Temple of Iuppiter Optimus Maximus (the High God of the Roman pantheon) on the Capitoline hill, to be completed by his son; and he constructed a massive sewer, the cloaca maxima, to drain the swamp between the Palatine and Capitoline hills, which would later become the site of the famous Roman Forum. He also continued the construction of walled defenses around the entire city.
On the military front, Tarquin initiated a war against the neighboring Latins, seizing the town of Apiolae and a great deal of booty, instituting annual games as celebration. (He would go on to take and assimilate additional Latin cities in subsequent offensives.) He then weathered an Etruscan-supported Sabine assault with exceptional difficulty — fighting spilled into the streets of Rome, and the Sabines were only barely repelled. Following an initial surprise attack that inflicted heavy losses, the Sabines withdrew to prepare for another offensive. Livy recounts the dramatic second skirmish (Ab Urbe Condita I.37, tr. Aubrey de Sélincourt — an edition from the Heritage Club that I heartily recommend):
Hostilities with the Sabines were now resumed. The striking-power of Rome had been increased by the expansion of the cavalry [which Tarquin had completed during the Sabine respite], but in what followed it was a strategy that played the decisive part. A stack of dry timber which had been lying on the bank of the Anio was set alight and the blazing logs thrown into the water. A good wind kept them burning, and many were carried down by the stream and became lodged amongst the piles of the bridge, which they set on fire. This was alarming enough for the Sabines while they were fighting, but worse when their resistance broke; for the burning bridge prevented their retreat, and large numbers of them escaped the enemy only to perish in the river. Their equipment floated down the Tiber to Rome, where it was recognized for what it was and brought the news of victory almost before a messenger could get through.
As terms of the parley that followed, Rome received the Sabine town of Collatia, in which Tarquin placed his nephew Egerius as commander of the Roman garrison. Following the victory over the Sabines, Tarquin celebrated a triumph, or general’s victory parade, on September 13, 585 BC. However, this conflict poked the Etruscan bear, for they had supported the Sabine effort; twelve Etruscan cities banded together and seized a Roman outpost at Fidenae, a town to the north of the city. This seizure kicked off a bloody conflict that saw Tarquin lead the Romans against his native civilization. Rome was victorious, subjugating the truculent Etruscan cities and gaining great wealth.
Tarquin’s remarkable successes carried over into the social and political realms. To stave off the Sabines (see above), he had expanded the number of cavalry centuries from three to six — thus doubling the size of the equites, or knight class. He increased the Senate by one hundred members — importantly, among whom was a man from the gens Octavii, the family of Rome’s first emperor 600 years later. He introduced many Etruscan military, political, and religious rites that later became hallmarks of Roman rule.
Tarquin went as he came, surrounded by divine phenomena and urged on by his ambitious wife. I leave it to Ragan to report the strange story (Survey):
A very unusual event occurred one night in the royal nursery. The woman watching the sleeping children (both royal and household children were there) screamed when the hair of one of the children, a slave-woman’s [Ocrisia’s] son, seemed to be on fire. This brought Queen Tanaquil who, when she saw that the fire was not harming the child, took this as a sign of destiny for the child. She convinced her husband that the child, Servius Tullius, was thus designated by the gods to succeed to the throne. Some years later, Tarquin’s earlier treachery against Ancus’ sons caught up with him. One day, as the king was giving audience to citizens, a foreigner asked to speak to the king in private, on a matter of great importance. The king agreed and, when alone, the man (hired by Ancus’ exiled sons) took an ax to the king’s head and escaped. Tanaquil, wanting to secure the succession for Servius, carefully managed the situation as the king lay dying. She would give out daily reports about this recovery — knowing full well he was dead — all the while securing the support she would need to gain the kingship for Servius. This done, the death of Tarquin was divulged, and Servius Tullius, formerly the son of a slave, became the sixth king of the Romans.
And so Servius Tullius, once a slave boy, took power at Rome.
Servius Tullius: The Slave (r. 578–535 BC)
Servius was a king who knew his origins — his allegiances lay with the Plebs, the people, rather than with the aristocratic Patricians and noble families of the old order, to whom he seemed a mere “populist demagogue” (Ragan, Survey). Indeed, throughout the reigns of Servius and his successor, Tarquin the Proud, the Roman citizenry came into its own, earning participation in government and power in administration. Perhaps, though, the collapse of the old order brought the state down with it — the excesses and exiguities, triumphs and trivialities, virtues and vices of the Roman Kingdom crumbled under Tarquin the Proud. But all that is to come.
Servius’ great triumphs were social. In a reform known today as the Servian Constitution, he organized the Roman citizenry into five classes according to wealth, rather than to birth. The specific mechanism of this system — divided according to the armor each man could afford in wartime — relieved the poorest of their military duties. To accomplish this feat, he instituted the first census, or counting of Rome’s citizens and property, overseen by a censor. This division resulted in the Comitia Centuriata (the Centuriate Assembly), a body consisting of 193 “centuries” into which all Romans were sorted. However, while theoretically granting the Plebeians a voice in governance and law, the Comitia Centuriata did little to ease the Patrician [moneyed elite] chokehold on Roman administration — 180 of the 193 centuries consisted of the wealthiest estates, granting 5% of the Roman populace deciding power in all matters of state. (This unbalanced representation was accomplished by a crafty grouping of the classes: While the lowest estates had hundreds or even thousands of members, the highest ones had very few — think of a radical version of the U.S. electoral college.)
Though seemingly unbalanced, this division aptly reflected the contribution each class made to the Roman military: The highest classes were expected to contribute vast funds and troops to the city’s military endeavors, while the lowest ones contributed nothing at all. A democracy? No. But an accurate reflection of the relative weight and import of military matters in ancient societies? Yes. Before we leer at this classist system with a modern eye, perhaps we ought to recall Burke: “A true natural aristocracy is not a separate interest in the state, or separable from it. It is an essential integrant part of any large body rightly constituted. It is formed out of a class of legitimate presumptions, which taken as generalities, must be admitted for actual truths.” Political philosophy aside, Servius’ reforms laid the political, legal, social, and ideological bases for the Roman Republic to come.
​Class questions aside, the developments under Servius extended beyond his Constitution. Legend has it — though an archaeologist perhaps doesn’t— that he constructed the Servian Wall, enclosing 608 acres and all seven of the famous hills of Rome (Servius had expanded the city onto the Quirinal, Viminal, and Equiline). For the pauper, he was a prince: He eliminated debt imprisonment and eased the tax burden on the lowest classes, albeit in exchange for a paucity of political representation (see above). Furthermore, he entrusted the precariat to its land, labor, and liberty, dividing public land and letting the poor farm and tend to themselves. He divided the people of Rome into four tribes and the entire country into thirty one. He founded a very important shrine to Diana on the Aventine Hill, a shrine that became the administrative center of a critical alliance between Rome and the Latin League (an alliance of neighboring tribes and communities aligned against Roman expansion). For the first time, Servius energetically delineated the bounds of citizenship: His Constitutional ukase placed freedmen within his classes, thus enfranchising former slaves and bolstering the citizen base. Additionally, Servius established several religious festivals, most notably the Compitalia (celebrated in early January each year).
Before we recount the pitiable end of old Servius, let us recap Rome’s status at the end of his reign. Rome had expanded territorially, occupying all Seven of the famous Hills. Her citizenry was divided by wealth, not birth. The Servian Constitution had laid the basis for the Republic that was soon to come. Rome’s geopolitical situation was strong, with alliances secured with the Latin League and the Etruscans. Freedman and poor alike were newly protected and empowered.
Alas, Servius’ humble origins returned to haunt him. I once again defer to Ragan to recount the death of Servius and the ascendency of his successor, Tarquin the Proud (Survey):
Servius’ origin, however, continued to plague him as the Roman aristocracy felt demeaned, being ruled by a former slave. Thus, Servius Tullius married his two daughters, both named Tullia, to two sons (or grandsons) of the former King Tarquin [Tarquinius Priscus]: Tarquin (called Superbus, “the proud, arrogant”) and the younger Arruns. That Servius knew the characters of his daughters and his sons-in-law is shown by his matching. Tullia the Younger, married to Arruns, was as ambitious and conniving as her true love, the man she most admired, Arruns’ younger brother; Tullia the Elder, a devoted, if simple, wife was utterly unlike her conniving, ambitious husband. [i.e the ambitious and conniving Tullia the Younger was married to the simple and devoted Arruns; the simple and devoted Tullia the Elder was married to the ambitious and conniving Tarquinius Superbus. Tullia the Elder pined for Tarquinius Superbus (and vice versa), and was bound to get her way, a marriage from Dante’s Hell; trouble stewed in each couple’s nuptial hours.] Livy puts it rather succinctly: “Two deaths soon followed,” and the surviving Tullia and Tarquin joined in marriage and conspiracy. Working long behind the scenes, when Tarquin decided it was time to act, he boldly went into the Forum to the Curia (Senate House), sat on the royal throne, and proclaimed himself king before the shocked populace. Tullia shamelessly appeared in public and, from her carriage, heralded her husband’s usurpation. Hearing the clamor, old Servius came into the Forum (the Regia, or royal palace, was nearby) and attempted to resist Tarquin. The younger man hurled his father-in-law down the steps and, as he was led home, wounded, sent assassins to finish him off! Livy adds a gruesome touch: As she was coming home in her carriage, Tullia saw the body of her father deserted in the street. She ordered her driver to drive over the body, splattering the carriage with blood, and taking the curse home. The street where this happened was called thereafter Via Scelerata, Street of Crime.
Scandal, shock, scurrility — these were the accoutrements of Tarquinius Superbus’ accession. Where Tarquinius Priscus had pomp and pageantry, Superbus had profligacy and perfidy; where old Numa had decorum and decency, Superbus had depravity and debasedness; and where Romulus had valor and vigor, Superbus had vanity and villainy. The blood splattered on the wheels of Tullia’s cabriolet betokened more than the death of a helpless elder; it presaged the end of a mighty chapter in Rome’s history. The tale of Tarquin the Proud is one of crime for all ages.
Tarquinius Superbus: The Tyrant (r. 535–509 BC)
And so we come to Tarquin the Proud, as all histories of the Roman Kingdom must, the final king of the great house of Tarquin. His cognomen, “Superbus,” (translated as “proud” or “arrogant”) tells all. Ragan aptly characterizes his rule: “That bloody and inauspicious act was only the beginning to what became a despot’s reign of terror. As is the case with all tyrants, no class or individual was spared from Tarquin’s jealousy or cruelty” (Survey). Indeed, so wretched was the rule of Tarquin that he made the title of rex, or king, forever hateful to the Romans, inscribing his name with blood on the tapestry of Roman descent. As Cicero questioned in his Republica, “Are you not aware that it was the insolence and pride of one man, Tarquinius, that made the title of king odious to our people?”
Ambition, wealth, and disregard make a vile combination; Tarquin began his reign with a murderous romp. He refused to entomb old Servius, and executed any senator whom he deemed a “loyalist” supporter of Servius, seizing their property for his own and reducing the size of the Senate. He mustered a bodyguard to facilitate his haughty uninhibitedness. Livy captures his philosophy on governance: “Without hope of his subjects’ affection, he could rule only by fear; and to make himself feared as widely as possible he began the practice of trying capital causes without consultation and by his own sole authority” (Early History of Rome). He ruled as a tyrant rather than as a king, refusing to consult the Senate on any matters of military or state. His proto-Machiavellian foreign policy was just as brutal, as when he summoned a meeting of local leaders and proceeded to execute one (by drowning him to death, no less) under a manufactured charge, a blatant violation of Rome’s notions of justified foreign aggression. He used mercenaries for matters of war, a massive faux-pas in the Roman eye. One particular event recalls his military cruelty, the famous skirmish with Gabii (Ragan, Survey):
Unable to defeat the town of Gabii in battle, Tarquin contrived to have his son pretend that he was fleeing his cruel father — something easily believed. Established in Gabii, Sextus secretly sent to his father asking what to do next. While the messenger awaited, Tarquin silently went into his garden and with his walking stick lopped off the heads of flowers that towered above others. This “object lesson” was not lost on the son; many noble heads were lopped off, and Sextus gained power in Gabii only to hand it over to his father.
In religious matters Tarquin the Proud was equally inept. When the Cumaean Sibyl, a priestess of Apollo, came to Tarquin to offer him nine books of prophecy about the future of Rome (albeit for a hefty sum), he declined. The Sibyl, a crafty saleswoman (who knew!), burned three of the scrolls, and offered the six left for the original price. Tarquin yet again refused — and yet again the Sibyl set three alight, leaving only three from the original nine. Finally, Tarquin paid six thousand talents of silver — an exorbitant sum (about $99 million in today’s prices!) — for a third of the original offering. These books, which came to be known as the Sibylline Books, were housed in the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus and were consulted by the Roman Senate during national emergencies.
Despite its many disasters, the reign of Tarquin the Proud had one area of success: infrastructure. Tarquin, though deranged, understood the mind of the Roman populace; when kept busy, the people had little time to foment discontent. Accordingly, he imported Etruscan engineers and began several massive and lavish construction projects: the Temple of Jupiter and the excavation of the Cloaca Maxima, in particular. Ironically, however, it was the very area in which Tarquin found limited success that effected his downfall: His incredible infrastructure expenditure left the Roman coffers depleted and himself in need of more funds. And so he laid siege to the rich town of Ardea. I once again turn to Ragan for the downfall that followed (Survey):
The end of the Tarquins, and of monarchy at Rome, occurred with a tragic element. Away at a local siege [at Ardea], some young officers, including the king’s son, Sextus, his cousin Tarquinius Collatinus, and a friend, the (supposed) fool Lucius Junius Brutus (his name means “dull”), were one night discussing their wives. Whereas the other men bragged about their wives’ beauty and love of luxury, Collatinus spoke of his wife Lucretia’s great beauty, faithfulness, and diligence in keeping the house — at all hours. Finding this claim hard to imagine, the young men headed back to Rome late at night to find the situation exactly as Collatinus had asserted. Sextus was deeply struck with lust for the beautiful and noble woman. He later returned secretly with a sword to force her to lie with him. When at first she refused, preferring death to dishonor, he threatened further to kill her and leave a dead slave in bed with her. Rather than face public disgrace on herself and her family, the noble woman submitted to her shame. Some time later, overcome with remorse, she confessed the crime to her husband, Brutus, and others [including her father, Spurius Lucius Tricipitinus]. The horror related, she committed suicide in their presence. Aroused to mutiny by such an outrage, Brutus threw off the mask of foolishness he had cultivated to survive under a tyrant, and with many nobles, roused the senate and people against the Tarquins. The king was with the army; when he returned, demanding to be admitted to Rome, the gates were shut in his face, his property was confiscated, and the Tarquins were banished forever. Curiously, Sextus sought refuge in Gabii, where he met a just fate by the people he had betrayed. The exiled Tarquin sought the help of the Etruscan king Lars Porsenna to restore his throne. Failing in his attempt, Tarquin died in exile some ten years later.
And so the Roman Kingdom began and ended with rape: It initiated 241 years prior with the Rape of the Sabine Women, the famous snatching that furnished the hooligan hillpeople known as Romans with women, and it concluded with the famous Rape of Lucretia. Rome was now to be a Republic, ruled by two annually elected magistrates known as consuls.
Thus we conclude our fourth chapter of Roman history. The year is 509 BC, 244 years after her founding in 753, and Rome has entered a new era, the Republic, with two emergent leaders at her helm.

The problem is well-known enough to be a cliche: ancient history is exclusively focused on the lives and perspectives of aristocratic men. Sorting through this bias to recover the stories of other types of people — whether they be lower-class, enslaved, or in my case, female — is an inexact art. But allow me to try it for you. Here are 8 ancient Roman women you should know from history.
A word of caution before I begin: I am using Roman histories and literature here, not archaeological evidence or other ways we have of knowing about the Romans. That means I am filtering through the biases of aristocratic male writers. To the ancient Romans composing the histories, women could be roughly filtered into two categories: good women (wives and mothers who devote their entire beings to the benefit of the interests of their husbands, sons, fathers, etc.) and troublesome women (women who dare to become famous in their own right, and thus must have Something Wrong With Them). A troublesome woman was assumed to fit a certain stereotype: she was a conniving woman trying to use the powerful men in her life to her own ends; she did not observe the proper sexual boundaries (adultery, but also often incest); she killed men with poison (the woman’s murder method as it involved sneaking around and no face-to-face violence). Some of the women on this list will fit the Roman “good woman” mold, but most will be troublesome ones. So Roman writers — already notorious for their problematic relationship with facts — frequently reported rumors as fact or outright lied to make these women fit their stereotype better. Take everything you read about these women (including in this article!) with a healthy grain of salt.
It’s the middle of the second century BCE. New wealth has been pouring into Rome from its recent conquests, from Spain to Carthage to Greece, and tastes among aristocrats are shifting accordingly. The ruling class of Rome used to pride itself on austerity, dressing plainly and maintaining simple lifestyles. But an abundance of foreign gold has tempted the aristocracy into gaudy, Eastern-style displays of wealth. Fine fabrics, gold, and jewels are everywhere.
Cornelia, the daughter of Scipio Africanus (the general whose conquests helped generate all this wealth), is entertaining a friend at home. The friend has just been showing off her jewels to Cornelia, then asks, “What about you? Where are your jewels?”
Cornelia, who is dressed simply despite her wealth, summons her two young sons, Tiberius and Gaius. She smiles serenely as she displays her sons to her friend: “These are my jewels,” Cornelia says.
Cornelia was a paragon of virtue, an example to all Roman women of correct matronly behavior. She was well educated in both Latin and Greek. She was an accomplished writer: she published a set of her letters that were apparently widely read and studied by girls wishing to be as good as her. (These writings, unfortunately and predictably, are long lost.) She was devoted to her sons and remained faithful to her husband even after his early death: Cornelia was an univira, a woman who had had only one husband. She even turned down a marriage proposal from the king of Egypt. (Remarriage after widowhood or divorce was widely accepted and even encouraged, but the Romans reserved a special reverence for a woman who refused it — an univira showed a restraint and devotion to her deceased husband that surpassed even social expectations.)
As I mentioned, Cornelia was the daughter of Scipio Africanus, the vanquisher of Hannibal, who was undoubtably the most important Roman of his age and certainly one of the most consequential in all Roman history. But Cornelia raised her sons with a mission: she wanted them to be so successful that she would be remembered more as their mother than as Scipio’s daughter. This came true, but not in the way she wanted.
Cornelia’s sons, Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus, were Rome’s first populist reformers in centuries. Tiberius became a tribune of the plebs (the voice of the common people) at a time that the office had lost its radical edge. Tiberius brought populist rhetoric back after centuries of aristocratic dominance, demanding land reform to benefit the poor. The aristocracy did not take kindly to the proposition and murdered Tiberius Gracchus. A decade later, his brother Gaius came back with an expanded list of demands and an illegal private army to defend him from his brother’s fate. It took longer, but the aristocracy brought in the actual army and Gaius Gracchus took his own life once his defeat was certain. But the aristocracy could not silence the demands the Gracchi had stirred up. The Gracchi mark the beginning of an era of popular unrest and frequent uprisings, a period that ends with the aristocracy destroying the republic and establishing autocracy. They begin a violent epoch in Roman history that changes the very fabric of Rome.
If Cornelia had any aristocratic reservations about her sons’ political careers, we don’t know it: in public, Cornelia was an energetic supporter of her sons. Remember that, in the Roman view, a good woman supports the men of her family. By supporting her sons’ political ambitions even at the expense of her own social class, Cornelia again shows the Roman ideal of womanhood. Even her own ambition — to be more famous for her sons than for her father — shows the proper sort of ambition for a woman: desire not for her own elevation, but for the success of her menfolk.
Cornelia was both an old-fashioned scion of idealized Roman matronhood and an unusually learned and accomplished woman. She was highly respected in her own time and remains well remembered by history today.
It’s the first century BCE, and a more modern sort of woman is in vogue. The docta puella (“educated girl”) is more independent: she’s witty and worldly, she mingles with poets and philosophers as an equal, she takes lovers without shame. Men write about her love as a revelation, her rejection as the worst imaginable calamity. The docta puella holds a power that is most unladylike.
The foremost of the early doctae puellae was Clodia Metelli. She was a daughter of a heavily distinguished household who became infamous for a pair of affairs: one with a poet who damned her as eagerly as he had praised her, and one with a politician that ended in an accusation of poisoning.
Clodia was descended from one of the noblest families in all of Rome, the gens Claudia — among other famous ancestors was Appius Claudius Caecus, who built the first aqueduct and the most important Roman road, the Via Appia. (Most of the women of the family would have been named Claudia, but Clodia used an alternate spelling of the name that was briefly fashionable in her time.) She was married to Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer, an aristocratic optimate. But when her brother, the infamous populist rabble-rouser Clodius Pulcher, came into political conflict with Metellus Celer, Clodia publicly supported her brother over her husband. This might seem surprising, but though it was mildly scandalous, it was also seen as typical at the time: marriage ties were weaker than ties to natal families, and many Roman women supported brothers and fathers over their husbands.
We can’t know for sure, but we are pretty sure that Clodia was the lover of the poet Catullus whom he called “Lesbia” in his poems. His poetry is the only evidence we have of their relationship, and we can safely say that Catullus’s poetry prioritizes melodrama over factual accuracy. Still, the outlines of the relationship are clear: Catullus was a young upstart poet, Clodia an established, fashionable socialite. He followed her like a puppy, and she kept him around as long as he amused her, then discarded him in favor of other lovers. In a series of poems, Catullus bitterly attacks Clodia and the men he suspects of being her lovers until one begins to wonder what Clodia ever saw in him.
We are certain that Clodia had an affair with Marcus Caelius Rufus, an orator and up-and-coming politician younger than she was. Their relationship ended, and Caelius made his way firmly into political circles that opposed Clodia’s, so in 56 BCE Clodia accused Caelius of trying to poison her at the end of their relationship. Her motivation was political, to tank Caelius’s career and harm his allies — whether there was a grain of truth to the poisoning story is unknowable, but either way, her aim was political, not personal.
In the trial for the alleged poisoning, one of the members of Caelius’s defense team was Cicero, widely considered the greatest of all Roman orators and a longtime political opponent of Clodia’s brother Clodius Pulcher. Each member of the defense team had his own job, and Cicero’s was solely to shred Clodia’s credibility. This tactic would not be allowed in a modern courtroom, but in a Roman one it was fair game. Cicero would augment his colleagues’ claims of Caelius’s innocence with claims of Clodia’s debauchery and wickedness of spirit.
Cicero’s speech (called the Pro Caelio) is a masterwork of invective, and a catalog of Roman insecurities about women in general and doctae puellae in particular. He depicts Clodia as an amoral seducer of younger lovers who bought a house overlooking a bathing spot so she could pick out her victims. He accuses her of poisoning her husband and of having sex with her brother, two ridiculous charges that he knows he can’t prove, so he brings them up through backhanded hints instead of directly. He even assumes the persona of her famous ancestor Appius Claudius to tell her how disappointed he is in her and how she is tarnishing her family’s reputation. It’s a brutal, no-holds-barred takedown. Clodia loses the trial.
Yet we get the smallest hint that Clodia and Cicero didn’t take this political feud personally. In a letter from well after the trial, Cicero mentions speaking with Clodia about buying some land from her. It’s such an offhand, casual mention that it seems that they were on perfectly normal speaking terms. It certainly shows that both continued to move in the same social circles even after the trial. Maybe they were even friendly. It is this detail more than any other that suggests Clodia as an equal to the men of her time: that, just like men in politics, she was perfectly capable of having vitriolic public clashes with someone, then meet them later at a party and leave it behind.
In the end, Clodia was a socialite. She mingled with the men of Rome’s aristocracy as an equal, had affairs at will, involved herself in drama both personal and political, and remained part of her social circles regardless. She was a renowned beauty, an occasional political operator, and the very model of the docta puella.

Clodius Pulcher, like the Gracchi before him, was a populist rabblerouser. He’d risen to power by orchestrating huge amounts of mob violence and had a loyal group of supporters who were about to drive him to higher and better offices. Unfortunately, he has just been undone by the very force that created him: his gang and one led by a rival named Milo clashed in the road just outside Rome, and Clodius has been murdered. It’s 52 BCE, and Rome is at a crossroads.
Clodius’s supporters have brought his body to his widow, Fulvia, who cries publicly in her doorway. According to ritual and tradition, these should be her next steps: Fulvia needs to have the body cleaned and dressed, then leave it lying in the atrium so visitors can pay their respects before the funeral. Then in a few days, she must gather the family for a funeral procession through the city, which will include representations of Clodius’s famous ancestors (of which he has very many — see the description of his sister Clodia’s family above). The procession will stop at the Forum, where a distinguished male family member or friend will give a funeral oration in her husband’s honor. Then all will proceed to the family tomb outside the city walls, where the body will be cremated and placed in an urn inside the mausoleum. This is the procedure, and though it can be fraught with emotion, it is orderly and time-honored.
Fulvia does not do this.
She allows Clodius’s supporters to take his body, still broken and mangled by the street fight that killed him, directly to the Forum. There they lay him on the Rostra and give his impromptu funeral oration — mere hours after his death instead of days — in a way that whips the common people into a frenzy at the loss of their hero. The mob takes Clodius’s body and decides to cremate it on the spot, but by tradition all crematoria are outside the city walls. So they use the Senate house instead. The Curia Hostilia, the senate’s meeting place for at least 500 years, burns to the ground.
It is a horrifying parody of a Roman funeral. Fulvia at least allowed it to happen, and quite likely encouraged it — it was the role of a good Roman wife to enhance the legacy of her husband, and Fulvia was consistently a funhouse-mirror version of the good Roman wife.
In the aftermath of Clodius’s funeral, Milo goes on trial for his murder, and even a court stacked with his allies knows better than to acquit him in the face of such popular unrest. Cicero doesn’t even risk giving the defense speech he’s written for the occasion. The burning of the Senate house was a message no one could ignore, and the Senate takes immediate steps to bring back stability. The march toward a civil war that will destroy the republic continues — and this isn’t the last role Fulvia will play in it.
Fulvia was married three times, all of her husbands ill-fated. Her first, Clodius, was the most successful populist politician in all of Roman history, until he very much wasn’t. Her second, Curio, had been a close ally of Clodius during his life and inherited Clodius’s supporters. Curio, however, didn’t have the reformist spirit of Clodius — he threw in his lot with Julius Caesar, and died in Africa during Caesar’s civil war. We hear nothing about Fulvia in this period. It is Fulvia’s third husband who will throw her back into the public spotlight almost a decade after Clodius’s death — another partisan of Caesar named Mark Antony.
In the aftermath of Caesar’s murder, Antony is one of few men in a position to try to seize his supporters and become the next Caesar. The next decade is chaos, with alliances and rivalries shifting constantly. Antony’s most consequential sometime-ally-sometime-rival is Octavian, the great-nephew and official heir of Caesar. Octavian is much younger than Antony and has no military experience while Antony is a seasoned and respected general. But Octavian has something Antony never does: he is an incredible propagandist.
Fulvia first enters Octavian’s propaganda by way of Cicero, who attacks Antony in a blistering set of speeches called the Philippics during a period of hostility between Antony and Octavian. As Clodius’s old enemy, Cicero can’t resist also attacking Fulvia, wife of Antony and widow of Clodius. He calls her a deadly thing that has destroyed both her previous husbands and is about to destroy her third. He simultaneously questions Antony’s morality by bringing up his many affairs and paints Fulvia as a controlling woman whom Antony slavishly obeys.
Fulvia’s response to Cicero’s attacks is emblematic of the actions of a Roman politician’s wife. Since Antony is away in the East and unable to respond, Fulvia circulates the city with Antony’s mother, meeting with senators and solidifying alliances that would protect her husband. Wives were the original lobbyists — prominent Roman men relied on their wives to set up their social calendars in ways that would further their careers, and when they were out of the city, their wives were among their most important advocates. Some accounts have Fulvia falling at the feet of senators and weeping to convince them to spare her husband. She is successful.
Soon, the rift between Antony and Octavian is brushed away in favor of a renewed alliance — and a proscription list. Proscription is a method of sanctioning political murders; Antony and Octavian offer rewards for killing their political enemies, then use the resources of the dead to fund their war on the conspirators who killed Caesar. Since Cicero attacked Antony, he makes it onto Antony’s list, and Octavian does not object. Cicero is murdered while fleeing the city. Many wish to see Fulvia’s hand in this murder: she exacts delayed revenge on behalf of her first husband Clodius (who had been Cicero’s staunchest opponent), and on her own behalf after Cicero dragged her name through the muck. But Cicero was at least as much Antony’s enemy as he was Fulvia’s, and the Philippics had been much crueler to him than to her. Still, the legend goes that Fulvia took out her hairpins and stabbed the tongue on Cicero’s severed head.
As I mentioned, Antony spent much of this period in the East, while Octavian kept firm control of Rome in the West. Fulvia stayed in Rome, putting her (again) in the position of defending Antony’s interests in his absence — even as he infamously had very public affairs with a Cappadocian princess named Glaphyra, then with the Egyptian queen Cleopatra. Inevitably, Octavian turned against Antony again, and Antony dithered about his reply. But Fulvia felt no need to wait for him.
In 41 BCE, Fulvia allied with Antony’s brother, Lucius Antonius, to raise an army and oppose Octavian. She helped raise troops, an atypical role for a woman to play. But her involvement proved helpful to Octavian’s propaganda: he painted the rebellion as the work of Antony’s out-of-control wife, who was just jealous because her husband was sleeping with other women. He said Fulvia had strapped on a sword and armor and led troops herself (which she almost certainly did not do, to my everlasting disappointment, because I adore this image for all the same reasons Octavian hated it). It fit well with Cicero’s earlier characterization of Antony as weak and controlled by women, and would transfer well to Octavian’s later war against Antony and his lover Cleopatra. We still have to contend with Octavian’s exaggerated image of Fulvia when we consider her, because his messaging was very successful — it has made a larger impact on history than Fulvia herself ever did. Octavian’s soldiers even inscribed sling bullets with sexual insults aimed at Fulvia before lobbing them at her and Lucius’s troops — in the propaganda war, this battle was Octavian vs. Fulvia, not Octavian vs. Lucius Antonius or Antony himself.
Lucius Antonius and Fulvia lost their battle in the Italian town of Perusia. (The incident would be called the Perusine War after this town.) Mark Antony disavowed the entire incident, and Octavian viewed his shaky alliance as worth maintaining, so he exiled Lucius and Fulvia instead of having them executed. Fulvia went to Athens to reunite briefly with Antony, but she died of an illness not long afterward. She did not live to see Antony and Cleopatra become so close they might as well have been married, or their unsuccessful last stand in 31 BCE against Octavian, the future Emperor Augustus.
Fulvia’s legacy is complicated. She was certainly politically savvy and capable, but as much as she did not fear to flout convention, everything she did was in service of her husbands’ interests. Ultimately, there is much about her that is unknowable. Clodius and Antony were on the losing sides of their conflicts, so everything we know about her is filtered through a hostile lens; we can trust no surviving characterizations of her. This, I think, is one of Fulvia’s most fascinating aspects: we know what she did, but nothing about what she thought or how she was. Though she is often held up as the quintessential Roman troublesome woman, the real Fulvia is an enigma.
Hortensia was a female orator who spoke against a plan by the Second Triumvirate to tax noblewomen. We don’t know much about her aside from this one act, but she won great respect in oratory, a domain the Romans considered male-only.
Hortensia was the daughter of Quintus Hortensius, an illustrious orator and rival to Cicero. The backdrop for Hortensia’s speech was the civil war that destroyed the Republic, the same one that Fulvia participated in. After decades of fighting, the war chests were growing empty. Octavian, Mark Antony, and Lepidus, the Second Triumvirate, proscribed their political rivals to raise money through their wealth (the proscription list that killed Cicero), but even that wasn’t enough. So in 42 BCE, they came up with a plan to tax the 1,400 wealthiest women in Rome.
Laws targeting women in wartime had a history in Rome: during the Second Punic War two centuries earlier, huge defeats by Hannibal led to the Lex Oppia, which limited women’s wealth. The justification was that wealthy men had to contribute to war by fighting, so wealthy women had to pull their weight by paying. In the case of the Lex Oppia, there was also an unstated reason: anxiety over women holding the wealth of Roman society. The Roman aristocracy had been gutted by the disastrous victories of Hannibal of Carthage. For the first time, huge numbers of widows were inheriting their husbands’ estates. Roman moralists panicked, and the senate acted to “protect” the fortunes of the great families from capricious women.
In the case of the Triumvirate’s proposal, the motivation was political: just as in the Punic War, the wealthy women who would be taxed were widows. Most of the widows of the aristocracy were produced by their husbands’ deaths in the civil wars — thus, taxing widows was a way of draining their political enemies’ funds posthumously.
A group of noblewomen led by Hortensia appeared before the Triumvirate to argue the injustice of the proposed tax. No authentic account of her speech survives. The Greek historian Appian, writing a century later, presents a version of her speech produced by his own imagination — this speech includes the jarringly modern argument that women were being taxed for a war that they had no say in, because they could not vote or hold public office. In other words, an ancient Roman (Greek?) version of a suffrage argument, or perhaps no taxation without representation. What the real Hortensia said is a mystery, but we hear glowing reviews from various ancient writers who did have access to the text. She was said to have resurrected the oratorical greatness of her father.
The Triumvirate tried to usher the women off the speaker’s platform, but the crowd rebelled. In the end, they reduced the list of women to be taxed to 400 and looked for other sources of revenue. Hortensia’s speech was a partial success.
Hortensia’s story isn’t as extensive as some of the other women’s on this list, but she was certainly a woman who took ownership of an issue. She stepped out of the traditional woman’s role in Rome and into the spotlight of politics, however briefly — and unlike of the most women who did so, she won respect instead of condemnation.
Sulpicia is a true rarity: a female Roman poet. We know of a few poetesses from Roman times (one of whom, hilariously, is a Silver Age poet also named Sulpicia). But only the Sulpicia of the first century CE has a body of poems still in existence today. So what can our lone surviving female Roman poet tell us?
Sulpicia was a docta puella from a literary family: her grandfather was Servius Sulpicius Rufus, whom Cicero called the greatest orator he’d ever heard, and the uncle who raised her was the literary patron who launched the career of Ovid. It’s no surprise she became a writer. Her oeuvre is short, six poems totaling 40 lines together. Her complete collected works fit comfortably on one sheet of paper. They are elegiac poems, a Roman genre of passionate poems addressed to (usually fickle) lovers. She writes about a pseudonymous lover named Cerinthus — her love for him, and the pain caused by both of their missteps and by other people pulling them apart. She takes on the voice of an emotional teenage girl, pouting at her uncle as he plans an inconvenient family trip, cursing herself for missteps in communication with her lover, and wrestling with questions about her identity and place in society.
For centuries, Sulpicia’s poems were not recognized as hers. They were preserved in a manuscript of Tibullus and assumed to be his. Scholarship showed her authorship in the 1800s, but for the next century, she was regarded only as a curiosity. Scholars said her poems lacked refinement, that she was a passionate, emotional amateur who didn’t merit serious study. (Gee, I wonder if her gender had anything to do with these assessments.) Only in the 1970s did scholars start to take a closer look, strip away the prejudices of the past, and begin to appreciate the talent and erudition underlying Sulpicia’s poetry.
But even if those old-fashioned scholars had been right about her, Sulpicia would still offer us something no other Roman poet can. Much Roman ink was spilled writing about men chasing after doctae puellae, but in Sulpicia’s case, the docta puella herself speaks. She has much to say about identity and social respectability from a woman’s viewpoint. Although Sulpicia’s work is not extensive and does not touch on many of the subjects we would love to know about through her eyes, still, she is an authentic female Roman voice — one of very few we still have access to — and thus can help us make up for some of the bothersome blind spots in our study of the Roman experience.

Livia Drusilla was the wife of Augustus and first empress of Rome — it can be fairly said that she set the expectations for all empresses after her. She was a close advisor and confidant of the emperor and was thus heavily involved in politics. But unlike Fulvia, she kept herself rigidly within the acceptable social boundaries set for Roman women, so her public image during her lifetime was much more positive. After her death, however, it turns out that no amount of piety can satisfy the writers of history, because she gets accused of being a conniving murderer in equal measure with her more scandalous peers.
Livia was the third wife of Augustus (the former Octavian), but seems to have been the first one he married for love rather than alliance-building. They were both married to other people when they met, and Augustus was immediately smitten. He divorced his wife Scribonia on the same day she gave birth to their daughter, and compelled Livia’s husband, Tiberius Claudius Nero, to divorce her even though she was six months pregnant with their second child. Augustus and Livia married immediately, and Livia’s ex-husband gave her away at the wedding ceremony as if he were the father of the bride. This was in 38 BCE, after the future Augustus defeated Fulvia at Perusia but before he defeated Antony and Cleopatra.
Augustus and Livia then had a happy 51-year marriage. Livia was just as careful in presenting her public image as her husband always was: she was depicted consistently as a chaste, modest, religiously reverent matron. She never produced children for him (their only pregnancy ended in stillbirth), which many Roman men would have responded to with divorce. But Augustus’s affection for Livia never seemed to diminish. According to Suetonius, Augustus kept notes throughout the day of things he meant to tell her so he wouldn’t forget anything when he saw her (which is the hardest I have ever liked or related to that slimy bastard).
It is ironic that Livia never had children with Augustus, because Augustus passed a slate of morality laws to reward women for childbearing in an effort to improve the aristocratic birthrate. The era of Augustus is a time of re-traditionalizing after the time of the docta puella — adultery was criminalized, and women were granted certain civil rights as long as they had enough children. The Roman nobility pulled its wives and daughters back out of the public eye, and Augustus led the charge. His wife was presented as the ideal matron in public. The fact that she filled this role for him without giving him an heir is a testament that their love was real and important to him.
Still, Livia was accused by later historians of engineering the deaths of Augustus’s relatives — and even of poisoning Augustus himself — in order that her own son might become his heir. It is true that Augustus lost a lot of heirs before reluctantly adopting Livia’s son by her first husband, who became the second emperor, Tiberius. But modern historians reject the idea that this was Livia’s doing. It’s a bit of slander that doesn’t fit well with everything else we know about her, especially the fact that she was never as close to her son Tiberius as she was to her husband. If you’re looking for an empress willing to murder her husband for the advancement of her son, look further down the list — Livia’s not your girl, but Agrippina is on her way.
After Augustus’s death of natural causes (no poison needed), Livia retained enormous influence as Augusta, the widow of a god. She clashed with her son, who had no desire to share power with his mother. Even as her real influence dwindled, she enjoyed the ceremony and honor her status afforded her. She died in 29 CE, 15 years after her husband, and her son Tiberius vetoed the order Augustus had left behind that Livia be deified upon her death. 13 years later, her grandson, the fourth emperor Claudius, restored all her honors and made her a god, Diva Augusta.
The age of Augustus brought a re-traditionalizing of Roman womanhood after the age of the docta puella, and Livia Drusilla was the posterchild of the proper imperial matron. Her marriage is a rare case of a happy marriage in the imperial household, and she garnered enough public respect to be honored as a god after her death.
Agrippina was another empress, the wife of the fourth emperor Claudius and the mother of the fifth emperor Nero. Like Fulvia, Agrippina is depicted in ancient histories as a scheming woman intent on exercising power through powerful men — and unlike Fulvia, Agrippina seems to have deserved this reputation. Her story is a soap opera that involves the murder of her husband and her own murder by her son in some real Looney Tunes shenanigans.
Agrippina was a member of the Julio-Claudian family tree, which is impossibly full of cousin marriages and adoptions — she’s related to just about anyone you can name from this period. She was the daughter of Agrippina the Elder (the well-respected granddaughter of Augustus) and Germanicus (a beloved general who was Tiberius’s heir until his own untimely death). When Tiberius died in 37 CE, it was Agrippina’s brother Caligula who took over.
Caligula’s reign is infamous, as is his relationship with his three sisters — he was very close to them and heaped public honors on them. (Several ancient sources say that Caligula committed incest with his sisters, but this is just slander and not at all likely to be true.) The relationship soured when Caligula’s favorite sister, Drusilla, died. The other two sisters fell out of favor, and Agrippina became wrapped up in palace intrigue and possibly an assassination plot. She was forced to carry the ashes of her executed brother-in-law (an alleged co-conspirator) in his funeral procession, then was exiled from Rome.
After Caligula’s assassination a few years later, his uncle Claudius took the throne and invited his exiled relatives back. Claudius had a reputation as a weak man pushed around by freedmen and women, especially his wife, Messalina. After allegedly scheming to overthrow Claudius, Messalina was executed, and Claudius began to think about taking a new wife. He chose Agrippina (now a widow twice over with one son), possibly as a way to make peace between the feuding Julian and Claudian branches of the family. They had to get special permission from the senate to marry because Agrippina was Claudius’s niece — ick.
As empress, Agrippina exerted huge influence, pursuing and killing personal enemies and piling honors on herself and her son. She persuaded Claudius to adopt her son, who took the name Nero — bafflingly, this meant Claudius gave Nero precedence over his own son, Britannicus, who was a few years younger. But apparently Claudius began to get wise and to prepare to distance himself from Agrippina and Nero. So Agrippina enlisted the support of the palace poisoner, a woman named Locusta (“lobster”) — yes, the imperial palace was the sort of place to employ a poisoner. With Locusta’s help, Agrippina killed Claudius by poisoning his mushrooms at a feast. Her son Nero remained his heir.
When Nero took the throne in 54 CE, his mother Agrippina kept a tight leash on him. She put his praetorian commander Burrus and his tutor Seneca the Younger in charge and publicly honored herself as nearly a co-ruler. Nero began to rebel, so Agrippina signaled that she might start to favor Claudius’s son Britannicus as his replacement. In response, Nero poisoned Britannicus at dinner just as Agrippina had Claudius. Picture the scene: Britannicus takes a sip of his wine (Nero put the poison into the snow used to cool wine instead of the wine itself to evade the food tasters) and drops dead immediately (Locusta had advised a slow-acting poison, but Nero had insisted on a fast one that would be obvious). His mother and all his advisers know what he has just done, but Nero says that Britannicus is only having an epileptic fit and will soon recover. The household is forced to finish their dinner with the teenager’s corpse still at the table. Nero wanted to deliver a message to his mother, and he certainly succeeded.
A few years of rising tensions later, Nero threw Agrippina out of the imperial palace. As he prepared to escape from under the thumb of the advisors she’d assigned him and start ruling for himself, he decided he should kill her too. So he offered her the use of one of his boats for a pleasure cruise to the resort town of Baiae. He had the boat rigged to sink, and had a trick awning built that could be triggered to fall on his mother and weigh her down to the deck so she couldn’t escape the sinking ship. Like I said in the introduction — Looney Tunes shenanigans. But Agrippina is the Roadrunner in this scenario: she wrestled her way free of the awning and swam to shore. Nero decided the time for subtlety was over and simply sent soldiers to her house to murder her.
Agrippina was a cunning, ambitious woman with the same lack of scruples as the men in her family. She was the great-granddaughter, adopted granddaughter, sister, wife, and mother respectively of the five Julio-Claudian emperors. She murdered her husband with poisoned mushrooms only to be murdered in turn by the son she’d put on the throne — no one can say she didn’t know the game she was playing.
There are many empresses who came after Agrippina and similarly played political games as wives and mothers, most notably the many Julias of the Severan Dynasty — perhaps if I ever write a sequel to this article, I’ll cover them. For now, I’d like to take you forward a few centuries…
Honoria was an empress of sorts in the early 5th century CE, just before the fall of the western empire — and indeed there is an old-fashioned tradition of blaming her for the Fall of Rome itself. The Rome Honoria inhabited was very different from the Rome of all the other women on this list; one might even consider it an entirely separate society. But the woman who couldn’t follow a vow of chastity so hard she might have sent a marriage proposal to Attila the Hun about it certainly deserves a spot on this list.
Honoria was the daughter of short-lived emperor Constantius III and Galla Placidia, another woman who merits discussion. Placidia, the sister of emperor Honorius, was taken as a prisoner of war in the 410 CE sack of Rome by the Visigoths. When relations improved between the Goths and Honorius, the Gothic leader Ataulf married Placidia in 414 to cement a Romano-Gothic alliance. But relations soured again, and after her Gothic husband’s overthrow, Placidia returned to Rome as part of a peace treaty, where her brother married her off to a general who later became his co-emperor Constantius III.
Placidia had three children, including Honoria, who would have been a young child for much of what followed: Placidia’s husband Constantius III died, Placidia fell out with Emperor Honorius, and the family fled to Constantinople. A few short years later Honorius died, leaving a power vacuum in Rome, and Placidia and her children returned to join the dynastic struggle. In 425 CE, Placidia had her young son set up as the emperor Valententian III, and she became his regent, as no one expected a five-year-old to rule. Placidia held effective power as Augusta for the next 25 years.
Placidia gave the title Augusta to her daughter, presumably so she could help as regent if Placidia herself became unable for any reason. But centuries of dynastic struggle made late imperial households take some extreme measures: as Augusta, Honoria had to take a vow of chastity so that she wouldn’t produce any heirs to challenge the legitimacy of her emperor brother. She found this difficult when she matured, and became pregnant by a palace official. (Honoria’s chronology isn’t easy to pin down, but I think she was in her 20s or 30s at this point.) Her mother took away her title, executed her lover, and had her engaged to a middling senator with no ambition as a way of disarming her.
Stripped of power and prestige, Honoria chafed. She had been raised by a powerful imperial woman and expected the same life for herself. And so in 449 CE, Honoria sent a request for help — along with her engagement ring — to Attila the Hun. She offered him the western empire if he would extract her from her terrible engagement.
The infamous Attila had been threatening both halves of the Roman empire for some years now, but had not yet dared to make an all-out attack. Now he had received a plea and a ring from the sister of the western emperor — whether Honoria had actually meant her gesture as a marriage proposal is unclear, but Attila chose to interpret it that way, seizing on her request for help as a pretense to invade and a marriage alliance as a possible way to hang onto Rome once he took it. He announced his intention to march on Rome and claim his bride.
Emperor Valentinian III exiled his sister Honoria — only the influence of their mother Galla Placidia stopped him from executing her — and had to fight the Huns in Italy in the early 450s. But Attila never took Rome or claimed his Roman bride. Though he won all his battles in Italy, external forces pulled him east again, and he died shortly thereafter.
Nothing is known of Honoria’s life after this incident. There is some evidence to suggest that she was dead six years later, in 455, but we cannot be sure — she either died young or disappeared into obscurity.
Historians looking for a sensational story have sometimes pointed to Honoria inviting Attila the Hun to attack Rome as the cause of the final fall of the west, but the connection between those events is tenuous at best. That would imply that Attila was a primary cause of the fall, which is not a very solid argument. Attila, and by extension Honoria, merely contributed to the chaos swallowing the western empire at this time; they did not cause it.
Still, the story of an imperial woman so insulted at having been removed from power that she proposed an alliance (and possibly a marriage) with one of the most infamous so-called “barbarians” of all time to regain it… it’s a doozy, even if it didn’t actually destroy the empire. We can thank Honoria for one of the wildest, most soap-opera-like turns in late Roman history.
Socialites, schemers, pious wives, treacherous empresses — these eight women show a range of ways an upper-class woman could penetrate the male-centric bias of ancient historians and be recorded, however imperfectly, in their annals. My goal was to focus on Roman women who appear in the histories (with one sidebar into literature), which means this list is not intersectional: the lives of lower-class and slave women are more difficult to recover, though no less worthy of the effort.
These eight women represent a variety of ways in which women were received in their own time, from admiration to horror, from crediting them for making a difference to blaming them for the fall of society. A Roman woman was expected to support her family in public, but was routinely punished if she became too visible. The experience of being a woman was, perhaps, not as different from today as we might expect.
So tell me… which Roman women have I missed? Who should I cover in part 2?

“Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble Ancient footprints are everywhere You can almost think that you’re seein’ double On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs”- Bob Dylan, When I Paint My Masterpiece
How often do I think about the Roman Empire?
As a brown South Asian man, not much. I see the Roman Empire as a distant blip- a collection of bedtime stories featuring tales of valour, romance, betrayal, political intrigue, and war. However, when surrounded by the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, and the Colosseum, its hard not to think about the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire is inseparable from the life of the average present-day resident of Rome. The construction of the Rome Metro Line was repeatedly interrupted because every time they dug underground, they found Roman ruins. The average Italian’s regular Rome commute on the metro disobeys conventional underground train urban planning as it zigzags across the city to avoid running through Roman artifacts. The average Italian in Rome also disdains at the bumbling, clueless tourists who block the glorious Vespa’s right-of-way on the road. While the Roman Empire expanded outward from within like an amoeba conquering everything in its path, modern Rome is being conquered by tourists from without. And the reason for the tourist invasion? The gargantuan Roman artifacts that are interspersed with the average neighborhood in Rome. And of course, the food.
The word ‘romance’ comes from the old French word ‘romanz’ referring to the act of speaking in the old vernacular, more Latinized French. Romanz referred to a bygone era where Latin was the lingua franca during the Roman Empire. Stories written in the vernacular- or romanz- were action packed, chivalric, and medieval. Think Shrek, but less self-aware. These tales involved medieval knights setting off on Herculean adventures, slaying beasts, sparring with Barbarians, and winning a lucky maiden’s hand in marriage. These tales were a glimpse into the imagination of a person in the Middle Ages. It was a mythical adoration and idealization of a bygone Roman era which would be reminisced for centuries to come. The hero undertaking life threatening trials and tribulations to win the love of a beautiful maiden would- in this context- be romantic (i.e. imbued with the characteristics of a Roman). The ethos of Rome is giving Paris a serious run for its money in the title battle for The City of Love.
Another area where Rome gives Paris a run for its money is the food. We’ve all had a croissant- the flaky, soft package of buttery goodness that takes on a velvety texture when dipped in a cappuccino. The croissant is quintessentially French. Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite may well be the core values of the French Republic, but the word Croissant can be added to the end of that verbiage to include another aspect of what is core to being French. But what if I told you that there is a better alternative to the croissant- an alternative that we’ve all ignored over the last few centuries? Enter the cornetto, a larger, flakier, butter-ier, velvet-ier alternative to the croissant which comes filled with varieties of cream- usually, Pistachio, Chocolate or Custard. If you walk opposite to the direction of the teeming hoardes of tourists in Rome, you’ll come across local Pasticcerias- local pastry shops- selling cheap cornettos out of holes in walls. Italians line up around the block to collect their daily dose of cappuccino and cornetto right before their morning commute. The combination creates an essential fuel for today’s Roman, providing them with mental acuity and patience to tolerate bumbling tourists that block the roadways. One such hole-in-the-wall is the Roscioli Café Pasticceria- an iconic establishment that is always full, busy and teeming with Italians. One bite into Roscioli’s famous tent-pole pistachio cornetto expands the boundaries of what your mind thought was possible- the flaky, buttery, velvety soft texture of the cappuccino infused pastry is bombarded with the nutty, creamy, smooth, hearty textures of the pistachio crema. Now compare that with the croissant- a heap of flaky pastry that falls apart at the smallest touch. I will never see the croissant the same way again. The French have monopolized our consciousness and successfully convinced us of the superiority of their cuisine. Try one pistachio cornetto, and you’ll realize that a croissant is a middle-of-the-road bland husk of carbohydrates, or as the French like to say- merde.
Similar to the croissant, the pizza that you’ve been eating all your life is a lie. Pizza, once the pride of Italy, has been bastardized and appropriated by the Americans (as with all foods), and elevated to a sort of quintessentially American experience. The Pizza we eat today is what the American capitalist machine has forcefully shoved down our throats- a slab of chewy, overcooked dough, topped with excessively saucy and drippy tomaytuh sowuhss, complimented by an indistinguishable rapidly melting slop of mozzarella cheese made in a factory being operated by some poor bloke working minimum wage to mass produce a cheese purpose-built for the fastest melt rather than the best flavor. American pizza is not made with love, it’s made to suit the convenience of Americans- mass produced, characterless slop served quick and cheap, ready to reheat and eaten on the go in a Ford F-150. Italians take offense to the idea of New York Pizza. Even more offensive, are the Detroit Style and Chicago pizzas.
Romans have been consuming pizzas for centuries. Originated as a flat piece of dough topped with meat, vegetables and other accouterments during the Roman Empire, the pizza has mass appeal across cultures- take for example, the lahmacun in Turkey, the pide in the Levant, the mana’kish in the Gulf. The ancient recipe was simple- no frills, with no tomato sauce or melted cheese, providing for the best way for ancient Romans to gain energy on their long conquests, whilst maximizing flavor. Tomatoes eventually made their way into Italy in the 18th Century as a new world crop- “discovered” by Spanish conquistadors in their conquest of Latin America and brought back to Europe. And so began the tomato sauce fad. Look closely at regional pizza variations, and one will notice that pizzas in Naples almost entirely comprise a layer of tomato sauce on the dough. Meanwhile, Pizzas sold by decades old vendors in Rome include the original, sauce-less variations. While Naples does indisputably take credit for being the originator of the Pizza, there is an argument to be made that vendors in Rome remained true to the Pizza’s original tomato sauce-less form. One such Roman vendor is the famous Roscioli Antico Forno (different Roscioli this time).
Roscioli’s pizza, a very archetypal Roman kind- it’s flat, crispy, and served by the slice in rectangular form. Roscioli’s pizzas vary with the tomato sauce and non-sauce variations alike, producing variations that people travel across the world for. Their most popular pizza slice is the pizza bianca- or White Pizza. While the white pizzas sold at the large American chains usually replace tomato sauce with a regurgitated toxic sludge of a bechamel that fails to obey Newtonian fluid dynamics, Roscioli’s is without a sauce- leaving the white (or bianca) base exposed like a blank canvas ripe for culinary experimentation. Their dough- a treasured family secret- does all the heavy lifting. It’s crispy and flaky, whilst being flat with the right amount of give required for the perfect chew. Their variations include one that’s topped with potatoes, olive oil, salsiccia (Italian sausage) and rosemary creating a simple yet delicious slice that’s dripping with olive oil and can be eaten on-the-go. Another pizza variation famous in Rome, is the Pizza Marinara, reproduced best by another locally respected establishment- Pizza alla Palla.
Pizza alla Palla is tucked away into one of Rome’s back alleys within a quaint residential area. You will almost hear zero English spoken within a 500-metre radius of this establishment. It’s operating space is so tiny, that it can only fit 4 to 5 diners at once. The limited seating space is not a concern to their patrons, as the pizzas fly out from behind the counter in white paper bags to be quickly engorged on by a hungry Roman while they go on to conquer the Roman streets in their crusade against pedestrians and tourists. Pizza alla Palla’s pizzas- like most Roman pizza shops- lay behind a glass wall and are illuminated by bright yellow, fluorescent lights to contrast the bright reds of the sauce.
The Pizza Marinara, is a thought experiment on what Pizza would look like without cheese. While we’ve grown up eating cheesy pizza from American establishments our whole lives, the Romans have been eating Pizza without melted cheese for more than two centuries. Unlike with Roscioli, Pizza alla Palla’s pizza is carried by the sauce. My favourite variation on the marinara was a slice with anchovies, capers, olives and fresh burrata. The saltiness of the anchovies and olives when combined with the tartness of the capers and tomato sauce reinforce the hearty, fatty, and fresh burrata creating the ultimate flavour bomb that one can reminisce for years. If anchovies on pizza isn’t your cup of tea, then I suggest you go for local artisanal vendor Pizza Hut’s artful, hand-crafted, oven baked Pizza Margherita with a tomato sauce so generic that it may as well be copyrighted by Toronto based rapper Drake, accompanied by a cheese topping identical to a radioactive toxic sludge that makes Chernobyl look like a kiddie-pool.
Similar to Rome’s pizza, Rome’s pasta are quite unique and under-explored as well. The 4 pastas indigenous to Rome are: The Cacio E Pepe (Cheese and Pepper), Carbonara, Amatriciana and alla Gricia. What all these dishes have in common is the heavy-handed use of pepper to create nutty, mildly spicy notes to contrast with the fat of the cheese and guanciale (Pork jowl). Guanciale- a slab of fatty pork meat- is heavily used in the Carbonara, Amatriciana and alla Gricia and its fat often serves as a starting base for the sauces. Carbonara adds egg to this fat, Amatriciana adds tomato sauce and alla Gricia adds cheese, creating a holy trinity of Roman fat-based pasta sauces. The most common of these outside of Italy is the Carbonara, almost universally bastardized through the extra addition of cream, bacon and emulsifying agents. The universalization of American Italian food through mass production and the prevalence of American cultural exports everywhere has forced us to accept mediocre dishes as the standard. These dishes use old, chewy bacon instead of guanciale; salty, starchy, powdery parmesan with a texture similar to a social lubricant ubiquitous on Wall Street; store brought dried, chewy pasta as a vehicle for the sauce; and most importantly, xanthan gum to lend the pasta cohesion in order to hide the underpaid, overworked chef’s lack of skill in emulsifying pasta sauces.
Do yourself a favour and seek out a local Italian establishment- one that uses guanciale in the carbonara- and taste the difference between an actual carbonara and what you’ve assumed is a carbonara for your entire life. As one famous quote goes, “mediocrity is a sin”- or as I transliterate it to “never settle for a pasta that uses shit ingredients”. Local pasta in Rome is cheap, fresh, and even healthy given the average 10k steps-a-day mileage for the average commuter. To find the best, bang-for-buck establishments frequented by local patrons, ask the cab drivers for where they would eat. Or even go in the opposite direction to the tourist hivemind, and maybe then you’ll actually experience some local culture.
Walk down any Roman street, and you’ll find small, quaint trattorias selling suppli- a gooey, cheesy ball of leftover risotto or pasta that is doused in egg, coated with breadcrumbs and deep fried. You’ll find this everywhere in Rome. But it is often overlooked by small-minded tourists who conceptualize Italian food as pizza and pasta. Supplis (not to be confused with the Southern Arancini) are a small snack that are a cultural equivalent of a samosa- eaten either as an appetizer or between meals to satiate one’s appetite. Suppli can be quite intoxicating, addictive and pair well with local beer creating the ideal bitter and salty-savoury combination that hits the right spot at 2 am on a Thursday night.
We think we know Italian food. But we don’t. There are so many cultural variations and dishes that we’ve never tried, and that we’ll probably never try. Most of these dishes never make it out of Italy because Americans haven’t yet found an efficient way to ruin them yet. To go to Italy, and look for an Alfredo with grilled chicken on menus while committing the cardinal sin of asking the waiter for chilli flakes to spice your pasta is a disservice to the centuries old Italian culture that has tried, tested and perfected their foods. If you’ve ordered chilli flakes or chilli oil (as most Indians I know) at an Italian restaurant, you probably don’t deserve to go to Italy. Respect the local culture, appreciate it for what it is, and please, do NOT make the whole table wait while you immaculately position the dishes for your Instagram story. Not only are you upsetting everyone at the table, you’re also upsetting the Italians. Their dishes don’t need your Instagram story to popularize them. They’ve already refined their cuisine over centuries of experimentation.
My short, 36-hour Rome stay was eventful- I explored virtually all of Rome on foot, resorting to public transport only when necessary. I’ve tried everything Rome has on platter- the gelatos, the Pizzas, the Suppli, the Pastas, the coffee, the pistachio cornetto. But there is still a lot left to see- Italy is not just Rome, Venice or Milan. Italy is Sicily, Naples, Emilia-Romagna, Calibria, Lombardy, Tuscany, and so much more. To say, that I know Italian food is an injustice to Italy. I, on the other hand, can affirm that I know Rome, and I hope that perhaps one day, I will know Italy.
There is a saying in Rome: “The Milanese eat to live. Us Romans, on the other hand, live to eat.” The Roman experience is derived from the food. And perhaps, there is no Rome without its food- so the Roman Empire hasn’t completely died out. Its legacy lives on through its flavours, ingredients and culinary pastiches. The Roman sculptures look on as the centuries pass by. Empires come and go, and with it, the foreigners that visit Rome to witness the greatest city ever built. Neighborhoods, metro-lines, bus routes and office buildings are continuously built and destroyed on top of the ruins of an ancient, great civilization. Rome has always been in a churn of creative destruction. And all that remains- and all that will ever remain- is the food, sculptures and the Roman sun.

Part I
One of my clients, Chad Fuentes, recently said something that stayed with me:
“I feel like sometimes we romanticize the past and put undue praise on characters or people from that past, while holding the people supporting us in the present to an unfair standard.”
Yes. There’s truth in that.
I had been reflecting on something similar while watching a speech from one of our national leaders — perhaps the President addressing Congress or the Senate. I can’t recall the exact details, but the image was clear: the structure, the solemnity, the way history lives and breathes through these halls. And I found myself thinking, There it is. Rome. Different time, different clothes, same posture.
This isn’t cynicism — it’s recognition.
We, the people, love to imagine that we’ve evolved. That our systems, our sophistication, our technology have moved us forward. But have we? Strip away the gold and the marble, and we are often still functioning from the same roots. The same hunger for power. The same imbalance. The same blindness to the living beauty beside and within each of us.

“Mille viae ducunt homines per saecula Romam” — Alain de Lille, Liber Parabolarum
The phrase “All roads lead to Rome” is a proverb that originated from the ancient Roman Empire, reflecting the city’s central importance as a hub of trade, culture, and power.
In a broader sense, it means that there are many different paths or approaches to reach a particular goal or destination. For single mothers in Indonesia, this proverb holds a significant meaning. It represents the understanding that they often face numerous challenges and obstacles in providing for their children and ensuring their well-being. Even when it seems like there are no viable options, single mothers need to be resilient and resourceful, creating new paths to navigate and overcome the difficulties they encounter.
Their children cannot wait for a clear path to access their basic needs, such as food, shelter, and education. It is the responsibility of single mothers to provide these necessities, even if it means forging new paths and finding alternative sources of income. Single mothers cannot rely on their children’s fathers to fulfill their financial ‘obligations’ and give child support, so they must continue to strive for self-sufficiency and sustainability.
I cannot imagine the struggle faced by single mothers without the privileges of higher education, extensive networks, or even personal branding like mine. With a relatively high level of education, the privilege to live in the capital city, and a strong personal brand, I am currently feeling almost desperate in my search for a path to my own version of Rome. I can only imagine the challenges faced by other women who may still be recovering from the abandonment of their former husbands, having been allowed to be only housewives for years and financially dependent on them. My heart goes out to them, and I hope they are always empowered to find their own paths to Rome, their own versions of success.
For me personally, I am still navigating a path that hopefully leads to my version of Rome. I am still somewhat afraid because this time the road is dark and full of obstacles. I am still terrified because I often feel powerless, considering my age and the fact that I have a son who is still fully dependent on me. They say there are many roads to Rome, and I personally believe that. There are many ways to generate income without having to work in an office. However, not everyone can or wants to take those paths.
Some may not be able to see the options in front of them because to them, it’s too dark and eerie, for some others, they would rather close their eyes in fear of the uncertainties. If you currently feel unable to navigate these paths and want to give up, take a break, I feel you. Once you have regained some of your strength, you can continue. If you are currently closing your eyes out of fear, it’s okay to be scared. Give yourself time to muster up the courage and give yourself a chance to see what choices you have.
The important thing is not to give up. Hang in there. If you experience various rejections, it does not mean you have failed. It could be that you are being protected from a much worse condition or being redirected towards a better path to your own version of Rome.
One day, I hope you will look back and see your today as an adventure and valuable experience that you can remember with joy in your hearts. Until then, just hang in there.
I love yous!

Disclaimer: I got a little wild in this article, hide the kids.
History has a tendency to leave out very obvious same-sex relationships. We have all heard of the astute gentleman who lived with his lifelong platonic male friend in a house with one bed. You may not have heard that Hadrian was so head over heels for his lover Antinous that he declared him a god upon Antinous’s death.
I’m sure your partner is kind to you, but have they ever made you a fucking god?
The term homosexuality did not exist in the language of the Romans. So when discussing same-sex relationships in the empire, we have to do so through a lens we may not initially understand. This article will explore how Romans saw sex in general with a few notable examples.
We can only go off historical accounts, artifacts, and writings of the time when discussing civilizations as old as Rome. So while these views might be the majority opinion, there were likely severe deviations in mindset on a one-to-one level.
There was almost certainly an old bitter roman telling younger generations to pull their damn togas up.
We define homosexuality as a relationship between two people of the same gender. Romans defined sex through power and status, which means that as long as you were the dominant party, your reputation was unaffected.
To put it gently, it was admirable to be the sword and pitiful to be the sheath. Didn’t really expect to be conjuring up historical metaphors for anal sex when I woke up today, but here we are.
This could be seen at the highest level of roman society. Nero enjoyed the casual midweek orgy with men and women and did just about everything you can sexually do throughout his life. This includes dressing as an animal and attacking the genitals of tied-up men and women.
The emperor was batshit crazy, but you can’t knock his creativity. He also had sex with his mother. This fun fact isn’t relevant to the article — but I’m telling you anyway.
Nero had a young eunuch boy as his wife named Sporus, who was supposedly the spitting image of his late wife. This speaks to the more common pederasty of the time, but we won’t be getting into that here. I don’t discuss pedophilia before noon, as a rule. This marriage was peculiar but did not hurt the esteem of the emperor; it simply hinted at his mental instability.
It wasn’t until he took the former slave Pythagoras as a husband that everyone started giving a bit of side-eye. This was made worse by the fact that they had sex in front of their wedding guests. This resentment by the onlookers was not because Romans had disdain for same-sex relations. It was because their emperor was the “woman” in the relationship.
This leads me to an important point, Rome was plainly misogynistic. So even though it might seem like Rome was a sexually liberated place for its time, things were far less equal when it came to women. In fact, many considered lesbian relationships an unthinkable transgression.
This did not mean people of the time did not talk about it. A notable myth is that of Iphis, who was a girl raised as a boy. She falls in love with her appointed wife and is turned into a man by Isis. There is also the fictional story of Megilla, who changed her name and wore a wig to marry a Demonassa.
Several people, including Ovid, said women being sexually active exclusively with other women was an exceedingly rare occurrence.
What is more likely is that women were far less open about it than unquestionably powerful men like Nero, Hadrian, and Elagabalus. This is reinforced by the fact that it was seen largely as very socially unacceptable. Sadly, when lesbian relationships were discussed, it was typically with a tone of shame and disapproval.
This might have been due to how Rome perceived women and sex in general. For a woman to sleep with another woman meant that there would be a dominant partner. This was seen as masculine and looked down upon by the people of the time.
Women had an incredibly restrictive life in Rome. This speaks to the intelligence of the many that did manage to rise to power, as it was a very dangerous path to walk for those not born a man. I’ll cover that more when I get into Agrippina the younger, who was a fascinating figure and Nero’s mother.
Y’know, the one he slept with.
We can draw a lot of parallels from Rome, though their society was quite a bit different than it appears on the surface. It should also be said that several of the sexual liberties given to people were reserved for the higher parts of society, with lower social classes being allowed much less personal freedom.
Stay tuned for a more in-depth look at Elagabalus, who is a fascinating character and one of the first transgender people recorded in history.
I’ll drink less coffee next time.
Thanks,
Jack

I always wanted to go visit Rome and Tuscany, but for a while viewed them as two separate trips. But then I thought to myself, why not combine them? I had only seven days to spend in Italy, so it was a challenge.
Would the memories from traveling to Rome overshadow Tuscany? Would I be able to manage logistics and stay within my budget?
Looking back, I think it was a great idea. And now, in the winter of 2023, if someone had asked me what impressed me the most, I would say:
in Rome — Colosseum and in Tuscany — Pitigliano.
Rome Colosseum
I went inside, closed my eyes, and imagined what it was like to live in Rome 2000 years ago when on average 80000 people were watching fights lasting days at the time. Brutal fights, where gladiators were fighting with each other and with wild animals. Where spectators were deciding who lived and who died in the arena below.
The spectators in the Colosseum had separate seats with men being separated from women.
Romans did not have any problems with killing each other just for fun and regularly attending brothels…

Saint Cecilia in Trastevere: Patron Saint of Singers, Composers, and Musicians
A quiet Trastevere via opens to a large landscaped courtyard, which fronts this Basilica that was built over the home where Cecilia lived and died.
The courtyard is a lovely neighborhood playground — where you’re bound to see mammas circling strollers around the central Roman urn and nuns chatting away after mass.
In third century Rome, Cecilia was known as the girl who heard angelic harmonies — she could play any instrument or sing any song. She secretly swore to be a chaste Christian, but went through with a marriage her parents arranged anyway. On the wedding night, she broke the news to her husband Valerian, telling him the only way he could touch her was to become a Christian, so he ran off to get baptized. When he returned, he found their bridal chamber transformed — full of flowers and Cecilia wearing a crown of lilies and roses. This miracle swept Valerian into the faith. He made it his mission to help the poor and bury Christian martyrs, and was beheaded for his belief.
Then Cecilia was tortured for her faith, forced into a tub of boiling water in her own bathtub. She sang all…

I want to talk about a recent trend in mobile gaming. It’s the trend of desktop/console games getting re-imagined and made into mobile games. We’ve had all sorts; from League of Legends Wild Rift, to Call of Duty Mobile and even Nintendo getting in on the action with Mario Kart.
These games are not typically straight remasters. They are often altered versions of the original experience.
This means I have been left disappointed on several occasions as I download a game from a beloved franchise expecting the same high quality experience I’m used to on console. Only to get something very different.
Typically I have found it goes one of 2 ways with these console/desktop titles reappearing on mobile:
This is a game I loved as a child and when I realised it had got a mobile re-release I tentatively downloaded it expecting another second rate experience. O boy was I wrong, it’s brilliant!
Rome Total War is a strategy game with 2 types of game play:
So it’s not the simplest game out there. There is a lot of depth and freedom in what you can do in both the campaigns and the battles themselves. Given this, it may seem remarkable that this translates so well to mobile.
Google maps is a fantastic product, and one of the reasons for this is that it’s intuitive to use both on your phone and desktop. It is so easy to explore the world with Google Maps. Whether pinching or scrolling to zoom, clicking or tapping, there is no friction to navigation. Neither mobile nor desktop feel like imitators of the other.
Whether intentional or not, Total War has achieved the same thing with its map navigation. Creating what feels like a completely seamless experience on mobile when navigating the map, even when compared to the old desktop experience. This is hugely important as a large part of this game is about navigating 2D or 3D environments in order to make strategic decisions. It sounds so simple but getting this navigation right, to me is the cornerstone of what makes Rome such a good port.
Alongside the map navigation exploring the UI and interacting with map elements is also incredibly frictionless. With certain button sizes scaled up and freedom in how you scale the HUD I never once felt limited using a touch screen over a mouse and keyboard.
Now this is going to sound overly simplified but here it is. Rome Total War on mobile is such a great game because it is exactly the same as Rome Total War on desktop, and that was a great game.
As far as I can tell nothing is missing from the mobile version versus the desktop game. This means the same incredibly deep campaign experience is available in your pocket.
With too many mobile ports you see simplification or compromises made on the original experience. Which as mentioned before can leave you feeling unsatisfied. Rome Total War does not compromise and that is great.
The best part of Rome Total War is the campaigns. When I played Total War as a child I would play for hours on end, working my way through campaigns one turn at a time. Now if I have hours to play games typically I won’t be on my phone.
However I feel like this port has got me playing just as much as I did as a child, but in a very different way.
You see because the campaigns are turn based this means they are filled with natural pauses. Each turn still takes me 5–10 minutes but this time the game lives in my pocket. Meaning Rome Total War through this brilliant port has shifted from an experience I would settle into on a Sunday afternoon to something I can pick up here and there throughout the week.
So basically I loved Rome Total War as a kid, and now I’ve fallen in love with it again.
The controls are so intuitive you would have thought the game was made for touch screens and the experience is not comprised at all when compared to the desktop version. On top of that the game being on my phone allows for a new style of play. Giving me little bursts of nostalgia throughout my week.
Overall I think Rome Total War is great example of how you can re-release old titles on mobile and breathe new life into them.

In the 2000 years since Roman Emperor Septimius Severus’s reign, many don’t seem to know he was an African man with brown skin. And when I say brown skin, I don’t mean he was a little tan. According to a family portrait painted during his lifetime, Emperor Severus’s skin was an even richer shade of brown:
We’ll talk about why this matters in a moment. But first, please also take a look at Daniel Voshart’s photoreal portrait of all the Roman emperors in which Emperor Severus is featured on the third row in the third image from the left here:
voshart.medium.com
Kinda brown, huh?
The full richness of Severus’s melanin is not prominent in the light colored marble statue of him which was found in Egypt and created somewhere between 193–200 A.D. Held at The British Museum, the statue does depict Severus’s hair and beard as being quite curly. Several coins bearing his image also feature him with curly hair.

I feel like I should be documenting this somewhere. Partially because it feels too good to be true, and the other part, well — believes that everyone should know what everlasting happiness is. Even if it’s just for a moment.
I just moved to a new City. And it’s a godsend. The people here look like me. They speak both my native languages, and they welcome me with their culture. Their hugs. The microcosms in their face, they express gratitude for our shared experience.
The food enriches my being in a way I have not felt in some time. Not all of it tastes like home, but that’s what makes it so familiar. Deeply nourishing to the Ori.
And then.. there’s him. I met an artist. Full of love, of life. Of pain. And also, of beauty. Everything he’s been through shows nowhere on his being. His hands are soft, like a pianist. His callouses showcase strength, fight, only present because life unfortunately placed them there. But he still smiles. He still laughs. And enjoys the little things that life has to offer him.
He’s passionate. As both a lover and a being. He’s armorous. Unshielded for selected few. Olodumare blessed me with an opportunity to see him bare. And his soul — it lights me entirely. His rage and anger, they’re subtle and fleeting. His eyes, a golden honey. His lips, kisses wet enough to quench a thirst I never knew was lingering.
I believe that God gave me the strength and carried me through, just to bring me right here. To know a warmth so pure, so true. And know how to cherish it when it arrived at my doorstep.
And I swear on everything that I know, I would go through it all over again just to meet him once more — in this moment. Right here. Right now.
I’ve always wanted to go to Rome. Since I was a child. Little did I know that the city would offer more than pasta and parmigiano. It would be the thing that brought colors of me back to the canvas. And ultimately, a subconscious iridescence back to life.

Feature by Katie McKnoulty
Now one of Europe’s up-and-coming voices in food, Saghar works with leading editorial and commercial clients; runs cooking workshops across Italy; and has previously contributed to Italy’s national newspaper, Corriere della Sera. Her debut cookbook, Pomegranates & Artichokes, aims to show our innate similarities as humans by tracking recipes on her journey from Iran to Italy. We couldn’t wait to discover Saghar’s Travel Playbook of recommendations to experience when in Rome.
When I was born, we were not only in full Islamic regime, but we were in the middle of a war with Iraq which went from ’80 to ’88. It was very traumatic because I was literally born under bombs. My earliest memories are of the sirens that went off in Tehran that announced the bombings, and we used to put big chunks of tape on the windows so that if they broke, they wouldn’t break into our homes. We would go away for short periods of time when the bombings were very intense, to other cities. I remember very well that they had bombed maybe a few blocks away from our house, and I remember that the curtain of my room had been ripped apart by glass.
From a very early age, the first thing we learned is that your life at home is a very different life from your life outdoors. So indoors, everything is normal — you have parties, your family comes, you put on music. And then we would go to school, and we would have to wear the veil and everything. And your parents would tell you, ‘You shouldn’t say to anyone that we were dancing at home yesterday’ or ‘You should never, ever say that daddy had a drink, because all of that is illegal, OK?’. You don’t know who to trust, and then eventually you learn that almost all of the kids going to your school are living in a similar situation.
At the university where I studied art and architecture in Tehran, we had a very rigid education about composition and light. I struggled a lot in university in Iran to understand things and find my own visual language. Art especially wasn’t my thing, but my mathematical brain understood composition very well. Then, in Rome, I studied graphic design and design general. And eventually, I moved towards photography and food because I became really passionate about it.
I didn’t know anything about Rome. I chose Rome mainly because it was the Italian capital and in my silly, 20-year-old head, the capital is the place to go. This is what I thought. But when I arrived here, despite the difficulties that it has, I really fell in love with it. For those of us coming from countries like Iran, as students, the experience of arriving in Italy is very, very different from that sort of Under the Tuscan Sun experience. We live in a different dimension: when we arrive here, our goal is survival and we don’t have any funds or anything. And we still need to find a job, and we need to do all of these things in Italian. I went through hell because I was really scared of not being able to make it and having to go back to Iran. Even to this day, whenever I go somewhere and I come back here, I’m happy to come back to Rome. It grabs you and never lets go of you.
Rome is a ridiculously beautiful city. I think that’s very important to me. There are certain aesthetic things — like the trees, Roman pines that are like umbrellas, against the backdrop of the ochre and orange buildings. And the blue sky of Rome is something special. It struck me very, very hard in the beginning. And it still does. And then of course it’s historical; it’s charming; it’s got all of those classic grand things that are very beautiful. They give me joy, as frivolous as it may sound.
I live somewhere between the Colosseum and a neighborhood called Esquilino. And over the years it was not known as a very nice place, but now it’s becoming very nice and lovely — I think there’s been a bit of gentrification. It has a very, very long street called Via Merulana that leads to the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore; one of Rome’s biggest treasures. They have extraordinary medieval mosaics there — absolutely stunning. I love that church a lot. And then, in terms of museums, Palazzo Massimo and Palazzo Altemps are some of the most beautiful things that you can see — not just in Rome, but in Italy, possibly in the world. Often my suggestion to people who can’t get Vatican tickets or who don’t want to queue for three-and-a-half hours under the burning sun, is to get a combo ticket. It lasts for two days and you can see all of them, including the Vatican. It’s mind-blowing, absolutely mind-blowing.
In the side streets of the Via Merulana, there are a couple of nice places. One of them is a new bakery — Forno Conti. They have bread of course, but also croissants and cakes, and it’s become very popular. There’s a little community around it. It’s very different from the classic Roman bakery. Then there’s a little wine bar that’s quite famous now in Trastevere called Enoteca l’Antidoto, and they have very nice natural wines and littles dishes. There’s another trattoria called Trattoria Pennestri. The food is Roman but with an elegant little twist. You need to book but it’s not impossible to get in.
I do a lot of shopping at Esquilino Market. To be honest, the quality of fruit and veg is not always, like, a farmers market, but it’s possibly the most multicultural market in Rome. And you can find a lot of ingredients that you can’t find anywhere else. The African community shops there; the Chinese community shops there; the Bangladeshi and Indian community shops there. So it’s very interesting.
After university I discovered food blogs. Some of them were people who were very much like me — they had a background in the arts and now they were working with food. Some of them were doing astonishing photography, and that was the moment that it clicked. And I thought, ‘I can do this’ — not so much because I knew how to do photography, because I didn’t, but because I knew composition and I knew light. So I started practicing. It took me some time but it was also very nice, because for the first time I had found my visual language — the thing that I had struggled so much to find. It was very liberating.
The more I worked with food, the more I was intrigued with its cultural and political aspects and what it represents. So I started blogging about it and writing about it. And this is how I came to write my first cookbook, Pomegranates & Artichokes, which is exactly about those things. It’s also autobiographical, and this is what I do: I love to look at cultures, habits and situations through the lens of food, literally and figuratively.
Pomegranates & Artichokes is a cookbook that starts in Iran; then it travels west, crossing the Mediterranean and the Middle East through Turkey, Greece, Lebanon and Syria, all of those countries. And it arrives in Italy as if you were taking a flight — it literally does this journey. I love watching the map thing on the airplane and this is exactly that. I got this idea because this is a book that is born out of my experience of living as an Iranian, but mostly as an immigrant, here in Italy, in the West. This whole book is about how a lot of the flavors, ingredients and cooking methods are super similar. We’re not even that far, geographically speaking. Basically, you cross Greece and Turkey, and you’re in Iran — so how is it that people from my side of the world are treated so differently where our food is so similar? So this book is a testimony to those similarities.
It started because of the protests of the death of Mahsa Amini, who was murdered because she was showing a few strands of hair. So it is about compulsory hijab, and yet it is not just about compulsory hijab. There are many rights that women in Iran don’t have: the testimony of a woman in court is worth half of a man’s; women can work but if your husband says you cannot work then you cannot work; you can’t have rights to the custody of your child if you get divorced; and you can’t ask for a divorce — the right to divorce lies with the husband. What’s happening to the women in Iran concerns us all. And the fight against the Iranian regime is the fight to be on the right side of history.
Always window. I like to have space to lean out and look out of the window. But it’s mostly the leaning thing.
‘Via da Roma’ by Luca Barbarossa, from the album Roma è de tutti. The name says it all. It’s very nice.
Contradictory.
There are a lot of beautiful things and lots of ugly things. Like all big cities.

After a long silence (because reasons), I return to Medium (as intended a while ago!) I actually have several unfinished stories, some that are in old school notebooks and others just existing as a draft in title. So content is in abundance and hopefully I’ll be able to share more and more consistently in the coming weeks. I even acquired a tablet, with one of the main motives being more writing. In fact, my return article is related: I’ll write about a game I’ve been playing on the tablet. So without further ado, let’s talk Grow Empire: Rome!
As an avid Starcraft UMS and Warcraft 3 custom map player, I’m always on the lookout for tower defense maps on mobile. My recent search brought me to Grow Empire Rome. The name was familiar, but I hadn’t give it much thought at first. The reason it was familiar was because of a game I played on my phone before: Grow Castle and I would indeed notice the gameplay parallels quite soon into the game. They aren’t developed by same people from what it seems and indeed there seems to be a major difference between the games. Okay, enough with the fluff and meta, let me talk about the game!
Grow Empire Rome, GER from now on, is a defense game, rather than a traditional TD. As you might imagine, it has a Roman Empire setting. You have a base where barbarians attack, wave by wave, each wave triggered by you. So you don’t start a game and play 10 waves. You play one wave and it’s over. You can start the next one if you like. On top of that, there is an empire map and you can launch invasions on enemy colonies to acquire them, which sort of reverses the roles. Each acquired colony then has 3 waves of rebels you can fight whenever you wish. I haven’t bested the 3rd level yet, but I’m guessing that’s it.
You gain gold from kills in each wave (meaning you get some even if you fail the defense) plus some amount from your colonies. This amount can be increased by upgrading the colonies by investing in some gold. You even generate some of this gold when you are not playing. You will also get the option to watch an ad to get some gold now and then. Gold is used for upgrading your walls, archers, towers and units. The upgrades will occasionally have visual affects too. Units will look better every 4 upgrades and your flimsy fences will turn into actual walls with archers and towers in time.
The other currency, crystals, is acquired after every 10 levels or so, plus by defeating the rebellions in colonies. Crystals are used to buy and upgrade heroes, a type of unit that brings a passive bonus to your army as well as fighting actively on the front line. You also use crystals to upgrade your bank, which in turn improves your gold gain from colonies when you aren’t playing the game. You can also buy card packs with crystals. These you can use when invading colonies to provide you bonuses. Finally, you can buy mercenaries, which are extra troops you can use in invasions. As you might imagine, you can buy crystals and farming them takes some time (but not too terrible to unlock the most expensive hero to be honest.)
Finally, you gain experience from battles. This is earned by the General, which is basically you. You can level up and distribute skill points to unlock passive and active skills. I’m not sure if there are ceilings for these bonuses. I believe the cost to increase a skill also increases in time. I have leveled one to 20 and so far haven’t seen it though.
Each wave is basically a bunch of enemies rushing at your walls, fighting any troops they may encounter on the way. Your archers and towers will attack any enemies in their range but your main fighting force will be the reinforcements you summon. There are several unit types that will attack you and you will use to defend, sort of in a Rock Paper Scissors setup.
Speaking of unit types, there are 4+1+1 in total. 4 are the core units that you can use anywhere: Infantry, anti-cavalry infantry, ranged and cavalry. Then there is the siege unit, which is a battering ram that resembles Age of Empires variants. This is only used by the sieging party, not the defenders. Finally there is the elephant. From what I see this is only for the computer. Oh, and the heroes I mentioned above. I only saw them for our side and I imagine computer do not have them.
Normal waves will only spawn two types of units, one group after the other e.g one ranged, then one infantry, then another ranged… until the whole wave is cleared. You will have two charges of reinforcements at the start and you can use any of the 4 types, you don’t need to choose a layout. This will come handy in every 10 levels where there will be bigger groups of enemies in sort of mini waves, and their unit types will also change within a single wave. Every 30 levels you will face elephants that are loaded with hp and offensive power. Luckily, you aren’t limited to the two types of units at the start: As soon as you summon a unit, the bar will start filling and you’ll be able to summon more during the fight.
In addition to summoning troops, you have a few active powers you can use. These are your defenses (catapult and towers) and your general powers (e.g. raining arrows on enemies.) Some are skill shots (like the catapult) and others just work (like the general power that gives a damage boost.) You can also choose the ammunition type of your towers to be more effective versus troops or siege units.
The second part of the game is the colony map where you invade colonies, upgrade them and defend them against rebels. There are several colonies with increasing defense strengths, indicated by numbers on them. You can have 3 legions in each attack, which have 6 unit slots each. My legion consists of 4 main units, my hero and the siege unit. I believe the rest is to add mercenaries and maybe probably other heroes as well. Not much to do here as you don’t summon extra units and have no towers. You just use your general powers. The enemy has some troops at the start and gets reinforcements, so usually you’ll use them on cooldown to win as soon as possible. Once you take over, you can upgrade them a few times to increase the income, then fight the rebel waves whenever you want. This is basically a reverse invasion: the strength of base depends on the colony and the whole army attacks altogether.
The game shop is pretty simple. You can buy crystals, which you can use to buy commanders and card packs. If you just want to unlock the heroes, the crystal package around 20€ is enough (Germany IOS store) and a more pragmatic approach might be to buy less crystals and only get the Roman Commander (the most expensive one,) or maybe buy the same amount of crystals and just use the surplus to upgrade him a bunch. For the record, you don’t need this hero. The one you get through the campaign is pretty good and has a gold bonus that should be useful for a new account.
In the end, it’s nice that the game does not force you buy anything. But then again, I usually buy something from free games if I spent some time on it… but I really didn’t feel like buying anything.
All in all, I did sink some hours into the game in the last days. But it was also because I was sick and resting at home. I feel like I’ll depart ways as I don’t think there is more to see in this game. It doesn’t feel challenging, there isn’t much to see other than a couple soldier models and the grind is way too steep.
That said, if you are looking for something to play on the train or you know, the sacred part of the house, feel free to take a look. I did enjoy majority of the time I sank.
Before I end the article, there is another topic I want to talk about.
Now, checking the downloads and review counts, I notice that GER is way bigger than Grow Castle but since I played Grow Castle first, I want to compare them a bit.
The major difference is that GrowCastle uses the auto fight mechanic. You get some of it via playing and you can purchase it if you want: Basically the game will launch waves on its own and will use skills on cooldown. Sounds weird, but it actually works because in the end, the game is super repetitive and you basically play because of three reasons: Leaderboards, to unlock everything to see how they work (that’s me) and either lack of or surplus of will power to unlock everything and max them out. For the second, you only need a certain amount of grind and you want to be done with them. The other two makes you grind A LOT. So you want the result but without the effort… because the effort is really just starting waves after a while, then upgrading something every 5–10 waves or so. It’s not skill, it’s monkey work (no offense to tablet using chimps.)
I really, really expected this to appear in GER because the core loops of the two games are literally the same. But it didn’t appear and honestly, I’m a bit disappointed. I would love to see the final forms of the soldiers but I don’t know if I want to endure through the grind.
Despite GER being the bigger title, I think Grow Castle was more interesting in terms of content. There are many heroes and tower types to choose from and you can actually have builds in that game. Unfortunately, it looked to me like in GER you can just upgrade the main soldiers (which are out of the Rock Paper Scissors — they have no advantages or disadvantages) and summon them and only them and succeed. The comments I’ve read online also indicate that way.
So if you liked GER, I would strongly recommend to check out Grow Castle too. In fact, I would recommend it over GER, unless you are here for the theme.

We sat on the edge of high seats, resting elbows and ales on a wine barrel that had been fashioned into a table. Pigeons cooed on the cobblestones around our feet, foraging for crumbs and shards of cracker crisp crust that rained to the ground as we bit into our sandwiches. I had to hunch over parted legs to keep from covering myself in falling arugula and dripping olive oil as I ate. Mike leaned similarly across from me, his sandwich partially exposed but still neatly cradled in its parchment wrapping, a wad of napkins clutched in his right hand to wipe the corners of his mouth as he sipped and chewed. Over his shoulder I watched my romanticized vision of Rome play like a scrolling vignette, fairytale pictures unfurling from the pages of a luxury travel magazine.
Families and tourists wandered the narrow side street like a driven flock, progressing from the Tiber River on to the Spanish Steps awaiting them at the end of the cobblestone shoot. Heads swiveled and eyes swept in every direction, not a single explorer mindful of the path directly in front of them. Each was lost in their own sense of wonder. I followed the gaze of a little girl in a flowery yellow sundress. She wore a pink hoodie to keep her warm against the early spring breeze and her mother tugged her along by the hand. As she traipsed her attention remained fixed on a large three dimensional cone jutting out above the door of an artisan gelato shop. A huge scoop of pistachio gelato perched so perfectly on the plastic waffle that I imagined it dripping onto her outstretched tongue as she passed underneath.
A young bride-to-be led a parade of attendants from a corner flower stall. They wound their way around and through the creeping throng of tourists. Each had their hands full with a flat of matching centerpiece arrangements. Porcelain white lilies with long slender stalks of green, perfectly positioned and pinned, peaking out of vases the way only an artist could do. The florist, minding brilliant pops of crimson, fuchsia and marigold under a vast white umbrella, beamed with a contented smile as she watched her artistry depart. She was roused from her prideful stare by a lovestruck gentleman wishing to purchase a bouquet. I adored this about Rome, the prevalence of corner flower stalls. These oases struck wild contradiction to the bustling chaos; a fragrant reminder to temper progress with love and frivolity.
Rome was all this way. Everyday life coexisting effortlessly with the fray of visitors. Housewives with canvas bags of fruit and loaves of bread. Delivery drivers beeping and weaving their scooters through seas of pedestrian traffic, indifferent to potential catastrophe. Shopkeepers wandered out of their stores to chat and smoke cigarettes with their neighbors. Fashionable couples walked dogs and tenants added to growing piles of refuse spilling out of already overfilled dumpsters. The sounds of suitcases rolling and clacking over ancient pavers mixing with the patter of peddlers. It was a symphony. I was in love with Rome’s nuanced perfection. But no moment brought me more joy than this — our simple picnic perched outside of IL Salumaio, immersed in it all.
I’d wanted one experience in Rome: an authentic Italian sandwich made with hand shaved artisan charcuterie, layered on rustic bread with fresh cheeses and fragrant oil. I craved the experience I’d witnessed TV chefs and travel vloggers drool over time and time again. I wanted to have my own moment. A first satisfying bite that would send my eyes rolling back in my head with gastronomic euphoria. Mike was eager for pizza but Rome to me had to be this consummate sandwich picked up at an authentic corner shop. It had to be a genuine place, a place locals might go themselves for lunch. I wanted the staff to be a little indignant at our brass to invade their native sanctuary with our travel maps and attempts at broken Italian. I’d been swooning over the fruition of this sandwich months before my first airport margarita.
And I was nervous. I did not want to waste my opportunity on an imitation or weak trattoria contender. How were we to choose? I’d researched so many possibilities that I was dizzy with worry. What if we got it wrong and my vision of Rome shattered, leaving me with rancid memories of crowded lineups and the unending wail of emergency vehicle sirens? The stakes were high. This was our last day in Rome, we’d almost used up our half dozen dining opportunities in the city before departing for Sorrento. Until the hunger rumbling in my belly grew louder than the nagging for success I was dangerously close to overthinking the whole thing and missing out on my quintessential sandwich experience entirely.
We were on route to the Spanish Steps, having spent the early part of the day touring the Vatican Museum. It was well past midday and I was growing cranky, I fully admit it. My morning cornetto and cappuccino wore off somewhere between the Sistine Chapel and St. Angelo Bridge and hunger was gaining control of my good mood and cheerful disposition. Mike and I have been married long enough to recognize when we’ve met the point of perturbation that requires one of us to maturely recognize the importance of food. He reeled me in, “let’s eat.” and I was fully on board. I no longer cared as much about the authenticity of the trattoria we would find, as I did the necessity to get the thing done and put some food in my belly.
Hunger is under-appreciated by the traveler. We tend so easily to keep full, to graze endlessly and maintain a constantly satiated state. Trying bits of this and that and endeavoring to consume memories with the same fervor we use to fill camera phones. Not often do we allow our bellies to rumble and tell us we’re low on fuel. But hunger, the small h kind with light pangs and hankerings, the kind that clouds your good humor and makes you snap with insincerity can be a good thing. That kind of hunger spurs creativity and shuts up the food critic who, back home, keeps grape jelly away from corn chips. It makes us fall for gas station hotdogs and lures us to try regional oddities, offal stew and platters of whole sardines grilled with lemon and paprika. Hunger can be a blessing to a food experience traveler. Sometimes it’s the only thing that gets us out of our own head and opens us up to chance encounters. Hunger, on this day, in its wisdom, turned us left and forced us across the threshold of the first shop we could locate with meats and cheeses hanging in the window.
Inside Il Salumaio the wall displayed a dozen menu offerings, a curated list of combinations customers could order with ease. No sandwich had more than five or six quality components, and every ingredient in its own right sounded downright delicious. Glass cases were filled with cured meats and ripe cheeses. Prosciuttos and aging coppas hung overhead. The smell of fresh bread wafted from behind saloon doors and the resulting large flat sheets of rustic loaves were piled on the counter waiting to be portioned and sliced open. Bowls of sun ripened pomodoro and fresh mozzarella di bufala, marinated artichokes and basil crowded one end of the display case. Bottles of olive oil, truffle oils and an array of balsamics lined a shelf behind the counter. The hinges of my jaw twinged and tingled. I wanted so badly to touch and smell everything, I wanted to devour a chisel of gritty parmesan and secure a handful of olives to stuff in my pocket for later.
I halted my rumbling instead with an offering of whisper thin pistachio studded mortadella piled with wedges of Grana Padano, honey infused truffle oil and a large handful of arugula. Mike opted for the Italiano, a simple combination of prosciutto crudo, mozzarella di bufalo, tomato and basil. And there we sat, out there in the street with the pigeons, taking it all in. Swapping our choices halfway through as we often do. Enjoying the simplest of meals curated by chance and living fully in the moment that will forever encapsulate the memory of Rome for me. That sandwich made it all real. It fixed the impression of Rome to my spirit for eternity and I’ll be forever grateful to hunger and serendipity for this moment.
Back home from time to time, I make large flattish loaves of ciabatta and pile them with the best Italian cured meats I can acquire. It costs a fortune compared to the few euros a hand held lunch with pigeons cost us in Rome but with the best company and a lovely smattering of quality olive oil I can almost smell the orange trees and the Tiber River. I add wedges of parm and ripe tomato, handfuls of arugula and metered doses of the truffle oil we brought home in our suitcase cocooned inside a clean pair of socks. We sit in near silence together, quietly reliving memories. I think of cobblestones and a little girl in a yellow flowered sundress. I crave gelato and run my mind over the smoothly worn treads of the Spanish Steps. Mike tosses coins into Trevi fountain and we circle the trek around the Coliseum. We partake in an evening passeggiata and visit the Pantheon at dusk, but I always come back to that moment on Via Della Croce when my eyes rolled back in my head, fully involved in that first magical bite of Italy.
This is the joy of traveling for me. Losing myself in unplanned encounters, tying my memories to meals I attempt to recreate at home. I owe so much of my joy to moments of hunger and its gentle reminder that letting go is part of the experience. A part that very often leads to the greatest discoveries and experiencing the true authenticity of a place. A reminder that the pleasure of something as mundane as a sandwich should never be overlooked. The whole of a culture could be hiding in just one bite.

Me, Chelsey, and Jahan — a proper girl group — hopped off the plane at Fiumicino. This was my first trip to a non English speaking country. I was a struggling actress, fretting over if my hair was too blonde and how I was coming across on camera. Meanwhile, in the background, something exciting was happening. It just didn’t know it yet.
We took a cab into the city (90 euros — which means we got majorly ripped off. This often happens to Americans. Offer 60 Euros and no more!) and arrived at a breathtaking piazza in Trastevere.
There were kids throwing glow circles into the air, there was live music, and hundreds of Romans and tourists alike were dining on the patios of the surrounding restaurants. The piazza was complete with a fountain and an ancient church— the pious statues looking down on the raucous social center with irony. We later found out it was the oldest church in Rome. This would be our home.
Our building in the piazza had a large front window where I’d often sit and stare down in the evening. I was very far from Ohio!

Earlier in 2023, I thought of fulfilling my wanderlust and taking off on a solo trip in Europe — something my younger self wouldn’t have even dreamed of.
In my attempt to live in the present (coupled with my habit of tardily posting photos), I felt it was important to journal my experiences to capture my raw thoughts and feelings while I travel.
I’m glad I wrote them as it took me months to finally get around to sharing my travel stories, but here we go.
1/X: Barcelona, Spain || June 2023
Rome, Italy || July 2023
The day this photo was taken was the day I just did more sight-seeing: revisiting the Trevi Fountain, exploring the Spanish Steps and going around Piazza di Spagna, and marveling at the Pantheon.
I was grateful I didn’t have to take a long time in these places because the reality was that I was feeling anxious, looking for a repair shop that could service an American model of my luggage just a day before I depart for Firenze.
I knew and I’ve been warned it was not the wisest idea to travel by myself to my hand-picked destinations with a big luggage in tow. I still did it anyway, thinking I could somehow have a semblance of home and comfort packed in a suitcase.
That time, I was only a week away from home, but boy, did I feel the most alone.
Traveling is definitely fun, but what we don’t see in photos is how it could invoke some feelings of anxiety too.
I eventually found myself capping the night at Trastevere.
I’m glad I made it well that day. As usual, thanks to the people providing care and support in person and virtually, and for that night, for that rich plate of truffle pasta and a glass of wine to comfort me.
I leave Roma today to transfer to Firenze.
This city captivated me — maybe made me fall in love — during last year’s visit with my family; it’s one of the main reasons why I wanted to return to Italy.
But today I recognize how life continues to surprise us —
like that time I walked through the ruins of the Colosseo and be reminded that I used to wonder about it when I was a child but never deeply dreamed of it because I thought it was impossible to see,
but also I have those times when I’ve been working towards a dream, a desire, and then realizing it may not necessarily be what I want or need.
So here’s a little (self-)reminder: I hope that when things aren’t going how you think they’re supposed to be, open up yourself to the opportunity, and trust that life will continue to surprise you.

Dear friend,
I’m holding a glass of Aperol spritz, and this is the view in front of me. It’s a hot April afternoon in Rome, about 25 degrees. I’m wearing my black dress, feeling the Roman elegance. A slight breeze touches my face.
On the way here, we climbed a hill. There were many people around in their stylish outfits-tourists and Italians. We ascended numerous stairs that seemed to stretch up to the sky. The stairs were made of stone and they were old, like everything in Rome.
After climbing so many stairs, we entered a garden filled with tall trees. There were no tourists here, only Romans. I guess this is one of Rome’s hidden treasures. I only hear Italian being spoken, no other languages.
It’s hot, and the sun is shining directly on my face. I take a sip of my Aperol spritz and feel better. It has ice in it. I take a piece of ice into my mouth and let it cool me down.
The view is spectacular. It takes my breath away. There are so many beautiful buildings in front of me. It feels like sitting in a park with a large balcony in the middle of Rome, admiring the city. Rome knows how to melt your heart; you just have to let it. It is so beautiful, maybe the most beautiful city in the world, at least for me up to now.
There is a big church on my left and a few more on the horizon. Far away, you can see trees blending into the cityscape. The street below curves to the right, with many cars passing by. I take out my sketchbook and start to draw.
Valentine is sitting next to me. I love him a lot, and I’m happy we’re here together. Now he is talking to me about his girlfriend. I like that we’re so open with each other.
Too bad, I finished my drink. The sun is shining intensely, and there are two boys next to us. One of them is shirtless. He reminds me of a character from “Call Me by Your Name.” He looks very young and has a beautiful body like the sculptures in Rome. They’re smoking weed; I can smell it from here.
People around me are speaking Italian. I don’t understand it, but I like it. I think if I were Roman, I would come to this place a lot. And if you were visiting me, I would bring you here.
I know you would like to write your diary here or read your book, maybe Fernando Pessoa’s poems. This place feels like a little escape from the chaos of the city, a spot to sit, relax, and savor Rome.
The place is called Villa Aldobrandini, with the stairs located on Via Mazzarino. I really think you should visit this park. I painted the view for you to find it easily. There is a part of me there, you should visit that place.
Love,
Me

I found this today:
# hosts# Generate standard hosts tables.# Newnet doesn’t really use it, it’s just for easy reference.# Neither does oldnet now, since it’s doing DNS right.#
It lives on line 327 of a Makefile used to build and distribute various configurations around our infrastructure. And it’s old. “How old”, you might ask?
Those lines have been in that file for 19 years. I know that, because I have primary historical evidence, as they say in archaeology.
When I asked about this “oldnet” thing, my boss told me to look up a document, Tenwen: The Re-engineering Of A Computing Environment. It’s a peer reviewed paper from LISA’94 that chronicles the creation of the fabric underlying the network that I administer today.
In the paper, under Fixed Name Service (September 1992):
Once name service was working, we modified the Newnet hosts to do hostname lookups correctly.
This fixed the naming problems for Newnet, but Oldnet was still broken. While we wanted to limit the amount of work we put into Oldnet, we also felt that having name service working correctly could only make it easier to administrate Newnet. We therefore modified Oldnet to use the nameserver on Newnet, and quit using host files on Oldnet as well.
So, those lines date to September, 1992. I was 13 years old.
One time, a couple of weeks after I started working here, one of the other admins asked me what I thought of all of it. The infrastructure, the network, and so on. It took a couple of seconds for me to put my thoughts together, and I said, “Have you ever been to Rome?”
He had, so I continued, “This network is Rome”.
He was confused, understandably, so I explained.
Some networks are like Phoenix, AZ. They’re relatively new and shiny. They’re brought up for the purpose they serve, and for the time in which they exist. There’s not a building in Phoenix over 125 years old. It was built according to relatively modern methods, and the streets are largely laid out in a grid, because there wasn’t a whole lot to get in their way. The city was started from essentially a clean slate.
Some networks, particularly in non-technological companies, are much more like Ephesus in Turkey. Ephesus is amazing…it’s kind of like a metropolis the size of Orlando just got up and left. Seriously, I was there, and it was mind-boggling. It’s almost exactly like it was 1500 years ago. There has been no modern development there, so when you walk through it, you’re in the midst of miles of ruins.
Rome, on the other hand, is a different sort of beast. Romulus founded the City of Seven Hills 2,500 years old, if you believe the legends, and it has been occupied for pretty much the entire time since. When you climb out of an underground Metro station full of artifacts excavated while digging the subway tunnels you just left, you may find yourself facing an Roman gladiatorial arena turned into a Catholic church. The modern Rome grew up out of the old, and there’s a continual architectural history of the past 2500 years waiting on you to find it.
It’s the exact same way here on this network. The new Windows desktop infrastructure runs smoothly alongside the host database mentioned in the paper above, written 20 years ago. It relies on the host database, actually. Like Rome’s streets, sewer, viaducts, and aquaducts, these antique systems were vital to the time, and if they aren’t still in use, they paved the way for the modern systems that replaced them.
Being someone who likes archaeology, antiquities, and old libraries and junk stores, working here is a pleasure, because there’s always something new to discover, and like I did today, a rich history behind it.

Everywhere I turned in Rome, there were overwhelmingly inspiring sights, but they were overrun by tourists, myself included. All week, I purposely was getting off the beaten path, scouring the city for places away from the tourist crowds. I find it hard to fully enjoy Rome with the constant crush of tourists everywhere I turn.
This Sunday, however, dawned differently. A strange quiet settled over the city. No honking horns, no chattering crowds, just the gentle gurgling of the Tiber River as I walked along its banks. I’d gotten up much earlier than usual, setting out on a walk from my Vatican City apartment to Trastevere, a charming neighbourhood in Rome.
The river’s curvy ribbon unfolded before me, its surface a polished mirror reflecting the soft glow of the awakening sun. Crossing the Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II, a bridge of pale stone and impressive arches, I paused to admire the view. Soft pastel colours, like scoops of gelato, washed over the city — a sea of terracotta rooftops dotted with church domes. Rome is a scene straight out of a postcard.
I relish the quietness of the city, broken only by the rhythmic pounding of lone runners and the occasional flash of brightly coloured bikes zipping past me. Sticking to the eastern side of the river, I watched the city slowly stir to life.
Reaching Ponte Garibaldi, I took in the panorama again. This vantage point revealed how far I’d wandered, with St. Peter’s Basilica’s dome just a distant peak. In front of me, a tiny emerald oasis emerged from the river — Tiber Island. A bright orange building, like a giant creamsicle, stood at its tip. (This is the hospital, by the way!)
Two bridges connect Tiber Island. Ponte Fabricio, the oldest bridge in Rome, stood strong with its thick stone arches from 62 BC. Beside it, Ponte Cestio is adorned with three graceful arches. Crossing over, I am greeted by the tourist-favourite Trastevere neighbourhood.
Trastevere was just waking up. Street cleaners swept away the remnants of Saturday night’s partying. Trucks rumbled by, collecting overflowing bins. Storefronts remained shuttered, and chairs and tables stacked high are starting to be dismantled setting up for Sunday lunch. It’s a neighbourhood waking and preparing for a new day’s performance.
Wandering through Trastevere’s narrow streets, I admired its unique beauty. Peeling paint, colourful graffiti, overflowing flower boxes, ivy climbing the walls, and laundry strung cheerfully across the balconies — even the “rundown” parts held a charm.
Reaching the tall stone archway, Porta Portese, I entered the famed Sunday flea market. But the peaceful bliss of my morning walk vanished instantly. Chaos engulfed me — shouts, haggling, and mountains of stuff piled everywhere. It was a stark contrast to the serenity I’d enjoyed just hours earlier.
Later that day, nestled in a cozy Trastevere trattoria buzzing with Sunday family lunch, I savoured my delicious cacio e pepe. The quiet morning walk solidified a travel revelation for me: waking up early unlocks a hidden side of the city.
For anyone who truly wants to experience a place, especially one as busy as Rome, consider rising with the sun. Early mornings offer a rare moment of tranquillity, allowing for a deeper connection to a city.
Even if you’re not a morning person, dedicate one day on your trip to this slow travel approach. You might be surprised by the magic you discover in the quietness of the city.

Rome is home to many churches and religious sites. Catholicism has deep-seated roots in the city, which is made even more apparent since the city is home to the pope.
I visited the city last month with some students on my first Spring Break tour. Part of the tour was a three-day stay in Rome. We visited the Vatican and the Colosseum and even took a day trip to visit Pompeii. The city is filled with piazzas and pizzas at every turn. Rome breathes history; if you can get away from the crowds.
This year, Rome was crowded a bit more than usual due to the Jubilee celebration. We often found ourselves working our way through busy crowds of fellow visitors, trying to take a photo at some of the most well-known sites.
Still, we found ourselves able to enjoy the city with its plazas and shops. One thing to remember about Italy is that they are not in a hurry like Americans tend to be. If you sit down at a cafe for lunch, expect to be there for an hour at least. Enjoy your meal, and maybe a nice glass of Italian wine.
If you visit Rome, try to find places that are less well-known to tourists. Yes, we saw the Trevi Fountain, the Colliseum, and the Forum. And while these places are amazing and worth spending time in, there are plenty of places in…

If you had been strolling down Corso Vittorio Emanuele in Rome among the many exclusive shops and charming sidewalk cafes on a sunny Sunday afternoon a few years ago, you might have seen eight well-dressed, middle-aged-to-elderly people slugging, kicking, cursing, and wrestling each other on the sidewalk, as a small crowd looked on.
Utterly unprepared for a street brawl, four American tourists and an Italian family sprang into what can only be called clumsy, slapstick, stop-the-chaos-at-any-cost, WHAT-THE-F*CK?!, schoolyard defense mode.
I know because I was one of them.
Until then, it had been a relaxing Italian vacation with my close friends Jenny and Doug, and my (now ex-)wife. We had traveled to Rome to attend the wedding of some friends and had spent the subsequent couple of weeks touring around Italy together on holiday.
We’d had a wonderful time driving aimlessly around in a toy-size rental car playing archeologists to Italy’s hieroglyphic road signs.
We’d marveled at paintings of naked people and mythological heroes in museums and did all we could to assist the natives in their efforts to vanquish the copious amounts of red wine and pasta the country…

“Take the first steps in faith. You do not have to see the whole staircase.” Martin Luther King Jr.
The Spanish Steps are one of the most recognizable places in the Eternal City. This place became popular long before the advent of mass tourism. At the beginning of the 16th century, the first hotels were built here, and in the 17th century, Spain acquired the Monaldeschi Palace and turned the building into an embassy. From that moment on, the square began to be called Spanish.
The stairs were paid for by a French diplomat, Étienne Gueffier, who thought it would be a great idea to connect The Spanish Square Piazza di Spagna to the French Santissima Trinita dei Monti church as a symbol of unity between Spain and France.
Did you ever count the steps by running up and down the stairs? I counted 270 steps during my round trip from the street level to the top and back — until a local policeman, carabinieri, tried to stop me.
They could not catch up and yelled at me not to run up the stairs. I giggled like a schoolgirl caught running by a principal.
As I ran the stairs, I remembered Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck sitting together on the Spanish Steps in their movie Roman Holiday. Watching Hollywood movies was how I learned European geography as a little girl.

We’ve finally found a grocery store right before closing time. It’s nighttime and the city pulsates nearby, colorful walkways beckoning us to invest more walking time, to explore one more little corner. But it’s crucial to get supplies for an evening snack and therefore a comfortable morning.
Whoa, what’s this?
It seems there’s a one-way flow of traffic through this store. I’ve passed the fruit section but decided I’d better get some more tomatoes after all. My feet are screaming at me to stop walking. As I reverse course for those cherished tomatoes, I face an onslaught of busy Romans going the proper and correct way in the store. I’m odd man out, like a salmon swimming my way upstream in a sea of annoyed Italians who’re peeved I haven’t learned the one-way-traffic etiquette.
What the hell is up with this freakin’ store layout, my brain screams. Why do they have to make it so complicated? Humans can’t be expected to always get what they need in the absolute same order every time!!
My partner Eddie and I make it to the checkout line with our bounty. Success. We’ll be back to the room and crashed out in bed in no time.

You never owned the terra firma of your conquests,Or the seven hills of your Eternal City,
You were but a transient occupying space at a moment in time.
Scorching the earth of those daring to oppose you,Sacking cities, devouring abundance, and smelting gold,
Your patricians choked on the gluttony of your spoils.
Sweating blood from the souls of the indigenous,Condemning slaves to perish in arenas of folly,
You demanded loyalty or slaughter.
Shearing forests to build your ships,Swallowing wilderness with your pastures,
Fallow were your promises of justice, freedom, and security.
Buying mercenaries with your taxes and tarrifs,Burying the poor with your worthless denarii,
Your gods crumbled into a common grave.
Woe to The Empire, Sunk into oblivion by corruption and greed,
Destiny is never kind to the likes of you!

Italy has always been my dream destination as I grew up watching Bollywood movies where many Italian places like the Colosseum, Venice, and the Leaning Tower of Pisa are shown. During my work assignment in Switzerland, I had the incredible opportunity to explore this beautiful country in just three days. Starting from Zurich, my journey took me to Milan, Venice, Pisa, and Rome. Even though my schedule was tight, this trip was unforgettable where I was lucky to see stunning places and have delightful moments.
Let me take you through my whirlwind Italian 3-day trip.

Flo is one of the first to enter the city after Nazis retreat
My mother and Audie Murphy ch. 15
The city of Rome was liberated by Allied troops June 4, 1944. Flo got to Rome the next day, June 5. She told me she was proud to come into the city with General Mark Clark and the U.S. 5th Army. The Third Division had taken big hits in battles at Anzio and on the Italian coast. Rome would be an easy victory, a source of prestige for the leaders and pride for infantrymen recovering from those battles. Later, historians and Allied commanders agreed that Clark’s decision to march into Rome instead of cutting off a large part of the retreating German army was a major blunder, extending the war for maybe another year. In any case, the liberation of Rome was overshadowed by the D-Day landings on the beaches of Normandy in northern France on June 6.
Flo kept detailed notes in a tiny pocket-sized diary. This was the first entry.
Monday June 5, 1944
Came into Rome in amphib Jeep with Frank Gates.
They were traveling from the camp at Pozzuoli, a seaside town on the Gulf of Naples where they’d been bivouacked with the Third Division. At first I imagined that they drove the 138 miles on the bombed out rutted roads. But these amphibious jeeps were faster in the water than on land, so now I’m thinking they traveled on the water. Amphib jeeps were used by the Third Division because they were training for an amphibious landing in France that would take place in August.
Flo didn’t make note of who was with her and Frank Gates, but I’m imagining all four of the American Red Cross women in her group went to Rome together. Gates was able to secure a promise from a rich anti-Nazi Roman to allow the ARC clubmobilers to stay in his fancy villa. The four women moved in soon after. The man did much to make them comfortable.
I wasn’t able to find information about Frank Gates but I believe he was Flo’s boss, the Red Cross director on the Italian front whose job was to establish ARC canteens and clubs near the front lines of fighting. He would be driving around Rome to look for suitable buildings in which to house the clubs.
Unlike Naples, which had been bombed for years, Rome had been spared from widespread destruction by the Nazis in part due to its declaration as an “open city” by the Italian government and the efforts of the Vatican to protect it, which led to a relatively peaceful occupation and liberation. No one, perhaps not even the Nazis, wanted to be responsible for destroying that historic city.
The 1945 Italian film Rome, Open City, directed by Roberto Rossellini, takes place during the Nazi occupation of Rome. It was one of the first post-war Italian films to gain major acclaim internationally.
The ARC women were some of the first Americans to move into Rome. Before Allied troops started coming in, they had the city almost to themselves and set about seeing all the tourist sights. Flo wanted to see all the famous architectural treasures she had read about as a child.
From a report in the Yakima Herald-Republic:
Life in the Italian theatre of war can be fun as well as hard work for American Red Cross workers, Miss Florence Wick told her mother, Mrs. Gerda Wick of Yakima, in a recent letter.
“So much and so many exciting things have happened since I left home that I can’t believe any of it yet,” Miss Wick said. “This last event is the biggest dream yet. I am writing this in my new home, which is a beautiful, spacious Italian villa. We four girls moved in yesterday from our dusty camp down the road and have the whole villa and grounds to ourselves.
“There is a bathroom and bedroom for each of us and we truly live like princesses in a fairy tale. The villa belongs to a very wealthy Italian, who is an anti-fascist, who lost his whole family to the Germans. He loves to do favors for us.”
High praise for Capt. Harold Haines of Yakima was voiced by the Red Cross woman.
“Capt. Haines is something of a hero over here,” she said. “Fighting in a war does things like ‘knocking off’ officers and men, but Haines is one of the very few original officers left. Yakima should be very proud of him. His own men are and that’s the acid test out here.”
The nice weather makes it even more pleasant to drive around the various areas to serve the men, Miss Wick said. Because the unit is not yet equipped to turn out doughnuts for all the men, she has had time to visit interesting places she has read about but never expected to see. Mt. Vesuvius and the ancient city of Pompeii are among the sights she has seen.
“I don’t know how long we will be in this beautiful place,” Miss Wick said, “but we are going to enjoy it as long as we do stay. No doubt we will be roughing it again in a tent or bombed out building before long. I won’t mind that if I get to stay with this grand division.”
The ARC women didn’t stay in the villa in Rome very long. By July 9 Flo is back in the camp, writing in her diary about cleaning their tent.

I posted a picture on twitter yesterday from one of my World History lessons where students perform an “autopsy” on the Roman Empire that garnered some attention.
A number of teachers asked for details of the lesson, so rather than try and explain it out in 140 characters several times to several different people, I just decided to put my write up here.
First: Obviously the medical gear is not required for the lesson. But I will say, if you’re willing to drop about $35 per class, it actually made a difference. This was the first year I added that piece to the lesson (based on student requests from last year), and it definitely played a role in helping get “in character” for performing an autopsy.
The major objective of the lesson is to have students demonstrate the ability to evaluate multiple historical perspectives on why the Roman Empire collapsed and form their own interpretation on why Rome fell based on the available evidence.
This could easily be accomplished without an autopsy — I could hand them sources and treat it as a document analysis assignment. But I was looking for something that was a little out in left field (those are the things that stick, right?) and required group collaboration to help vocalize the thought processes necessary for good historical analysis.
Lesson Origins
I will not take credit for this lesson idea. This is a common lesson shared among AP World History teachers. In the original form that I saw, students were asked to conduct autopsies on the “Gunpowder Empires” (Safavid, Mughal, Ottoman Empires). Some teachers also did it for classical empires (like Rome and Han China). So if you like the concept but not my execution, please go look at other iterations of the lesson. You can just google search “AP World Empire Autopsy” and see tons of examples.
I decided to narrow it down to just Rome because I wanted to have follow up conversations about the collapse of Rome based on their competing interpretations. I usually give student groups at least some unique historical arguments to help produce different results. So I wanted a more in depth approach to Rome versus the broad based comparative option with the original lesson.
I also wanted a lesson I could use in either my regular or AP sections of World History. I’m really big on the idea that both classes should emphasize the same skills and concepts, and that the only difference is the level of rigor. I don’t want the idea of developing historical thinking skills to be reserved for just one subset of my students.
Materials Used
Set Up Lecture
I walk them through the chronology of Rome’s collapse. As I explain it to the students, I’m going to establish time of death, they’re going to establish what killed Rome. So we go over the Crisis of the Third Century, Diocletian, Constantine, the East/West split, all the way to the final fall of Rome in 476. We cover the increased use of Germanic troops in the Roman army a little bit, because otherwise Odoacer does not make much sense to the students.
Initial Interpretation Analysis
I have a word document that has summaries of many of the theories for Rome’s collapse compiled together. I made it so there are even page breaks — no summary goes over one page. Some pages may have 2 or 3 different theories if they have shorter explanations. Each student in the group is expected to look at 1–2 pages and take notes on the main arguments.
A couple group members will need to head out into the hallway or some other space to trace the body outlines on the paper. When they’re done they come back in and read over some of the interpretations. What I usually do to distribute the work load is have the folks that stay in the room the whole time read 2 pages, and the folks that went out into the hall read 1.
Group Discussion and List Building
After they’ve had time to read through and make their observations, have them come together as a group and share what they found. I put the list of what body parts these “injuries” would correspond to:
I encourage students to get creative on the type of injury that they are identifying. Is it a minor issue? Maybe that’s a bruise. Major issue? Broken bone. Don’t give the students too much guidance because they get pretty creative on their own. For example, a group identified a shutdown of intestine functions to represent sharp decline in farm output in the empire.
Give them a few minutes to have this conversation, and then it is time to conduct the autopsy.
The “Autopsy”
The students lay their body outline down on the tables and begin marking it up with corresponding injuries. I show them that on most autopsy reports, they simply circle the site of the injury and then write commentary on what the injury is. That is what I expect for them on theirs, although some like to draw in the actual injury (so students draw broken bones, or one group drew kidneys that were a gross brown to represent kidney failure) and I’m fine with that.
The students have laptops that can flip into tablets, so many of them had their notes up on a google doc that they used for reference while they marked up the body.
Students are still deliberating about where to place injuries at this point — and that is totally okay. I try to be active around the room and interject into conversations either to validate their observation OR to encourage them to think of some different angles (e.g. for example, a group mentioned Constantine in reference to the rise of Christianity, because some historical interpretations argue Christianity contributed to the downfall of Rome. I pressed them to think about how Constantine may have contributed to a spinal injury … and they looked back and made the connection to him ending Diocletian’s tetrarchy).
As they wind down marking up the body, students have to pull up their shared google doc with the autopsy report and mark down what injuries they noted on the body (I have them do this step because they will often slim down or modify the list from what they originally developed as they’re actually mapping the injuries out on the body).
Conclusion
Once they are done, they take off the gear and turn in their body maps. They then sit down as a group and finish the google doc. Under the Opinion section, they need to develop a thorough analysis of cause of death. I usually specify the following requirements:
This is the most challenging part, but it is well worth the student results. They are engaging in a critically important historical skill, and rather than just memorizing a list of reasons why Rome ended, they’re actually being challenged to answer the question themselves.
I have about 60 minutes for this activity. Usually students start formulating their conclusion but need time the next day to finish. I use this as a pivot to discuss the next day and then introduce the Byzantines.

I’ve never been to Rome, but I know that I struggle with crowded places, and how the crowds don’t seem to change much even out of season in many tourist spots. Rome definitely sounds like a once only experience!

I traveled through Europe, and I’ve been home a month now. Contrary to what I’d expected, my time away only made me more acutely aware of just how beautiful it is here… this little piece of California, where I grew up.
Not that the things I saw in Europe were any less beautiful. No; there, I saw things I could never have imagined, things that took my breath away with their utter unexpectedness and newness (oldness, really, but all new to me). But I think I’ve come back with a kinder, more appreciative eye. I got in the habit, while traveling, of perceiving the wonder in everything; now, when I look around the place where I grew up, I’m pausing more to reflect, to capture memories as if with a camera, and not forget.
Here, at home, the hills are a deep green this time of year; we’re starting to get a few of those summery days that are just barely too hot, but then perfect all evening long; children are riding their bicycles in the street and laughing like they can feel the school year coming to its end. The other day, I walked by a big Mexican bush sage, and the smell brought back a thousand memories of childhood, of playing in the backyard with my sisters long after dark, when we had our own bush of that sweet-smelling, lavender-colored plant. And as much as I adored my travels, much as I already can’t wait to go again someday, and hard as it was to leave, I did miss the context I have here at home: the memories that come with all the smells and sights and tastes. The memories of my life, memories of me.
And the truth, I found, is that one of the things I loved most about the lush greenery, rolling countrysides, and swaying olive trees in Italy was how much it reminded me of home.
•••
I miss Italy. I missed it as soon as I left it. It’s in no way very original of me; most people I’ve talked to who have ever visited there say the exact same thing. But there really is just something magnetizing about it to us American folks.
I set up my base in Venice and Florence, but did have the chance to see two other Italian cities — only for one day each, mind you, but with the impression they made on me, it only seems fair I give them their own post here. For one day, I saw Rome, and for one day, I saw Milan. Sometime — I hope sooner rather than later — I’ll go back to Italy, and make it much longer than just two more days.
•••
I almost didn’t go to Rome. I had long planned that I would take a day trip from Florence and make the pilgrimage, but found I loved Florence so much that I didn’t want to spare a moment from it. In the end, I tore myself away and hopped the train — because how can you go all the way to Europe and not see Rome? — and I’m so, so glad I did.
Rome is often called the Eternal City, and it is every bit deserving of such a grandiose name. As I walked through the busy downtown, observing the perfect coexistence of ancient ruins, modern buildings, and everything in between, I felt that there really was something eerily eternal about this place. Structures from 2,000 years ago stand as though nothing ever changed, utterly undeterred by the passage of time, the rising and falling of empires and regimes, the growth of a whole new society around them — or the nosy wanderings of tourists like me, seeking to get a glimpse into the heart of this place, what so many of us learn is the birthplace of our modern world.
First laying eyes on the Colosseum was surreal. The only thing I can think to compare it to, though obviously I have never had this experience, is that moment that astronauts first see Earth from space: a rush of feelings, mostly it’s real, and I’m really seeing this, and we really are so, so small. Because faced with something that’s survived two millennia, how can you feel any other way?
Of course, thinking of just how many people and animals died horrifically in the Colosseum, all for the entertainment of others, adds a whole other layer to the experience of beholding this long-standing and impressive place. I reflected a lot, while I was there, on our own humanity — are we really much better today? We like to think of history as being synonymous with progress, with always getting better, but we are certainly willing to excuse a lot of suffering from our fellow human beings, all in the name of being entertained, aren’t we?
But then, that’s another conversation, entirely.
As exciting as it was to see the Colosseum, stumbling upon the Pantheon — because stumble is exactly what I did — was even more bizarre. While the Colosseum, Palatine Hill, and the Forum all stand somewhat set apart from Rome’s main city center — preserved in their own sort of ancient “neighborhood” — the Pantheon is just right there, downtown, surrounded by restaurants, apartments, and businesses of our modern age. You would almost miss it, assume it was a replica or even just an especially pretty building, if you weren’t looking for it (and I was looking, and still almost walked on by).
If my hometown provides me context for myself, and my own beginnings, Rome gave me some of that for all of us—for humanity. Not that we all descended from the Romans, or that our forms of government and society were all influenced by them; rather, being in the Eternal City, seeing this strange marriage of the old and the new, brought me to reflect on — despite how young humanity is compared to most of the universe — just how long we’ve been here. Surely it’s been long enough now that there’s no excuse to still embrace the kind of violence that the Romans loved watching in the Colosseum. I hope that, the longer we stick around, we will keep trying to get better.
•••
It would be disingenuous of me not to admit the biggest reason I was determined to visit Rome, and it had nothing to do with ancient history. I have wanted to see the city for years because of a certain Romantic poet who spent his last few months, and ultimately died, there.
I was sixteen when I first started reading John Keats. Fascinated at that age by his beautiful yet doomed romance with Fanny Brawne, I upheld a thing of beauty is a joy forever (from his “Endymion”) as a life motto, and longed to write the way he could. I took a class on English Romanticism in undergrad and felt almost like I was “cheating” on Keats with how much I unexpectedly ended up loving Coleridge’s work; still, “Ode to a Nightingale” reigned supreme as my favorite poem (it’s still way up there). And since I discovered him, I’ve been troubled by his tragic early death, but I really could not have predicted how much visiting his museum in Rome was going to affect me.
It’s called the Keats-Shelley House — as it’s dedicated not just to Keats but to all the Romantic writers, including Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley. The rosy-orange house stands, quiet and unassuming, right beside the Spanish Steps. When Keats began to deteriorate, his doctors sent him out of England to take the warmer climate in Rome, hoping that would restore him to health; he moved into this house in late 1820. He was dead in four months. He was 25.
When I first read Keats, at 16 years old, 25 sounded almost old to me. Now, I’m 25. And God, his life was only starting. Many scholars say that had he lived longer, he would have surpassed Shakespeare as the best and most prolific writer in the English language. He was a baby.
When I visited the museum, I got to see the room where he died. It’s small, with a fireplace, a desk, a bed, and two little windows, one of which overlooks the Spanish Steps. His illness did not deter him from enjoying the view, and he liked to look out at all the activity below, especially the bubbling clear waters of the square’s boat fountain (which is still there today). He died of tuberculosis, though his doctors resisted that diagnosis until the very end; and as a result, he was refused ample pain medication, and died suffering, terribly. That was really, really hard to learn, especially while standing in the same room where it all happened. I felt, suddenly, a little sick, and I wanted to cry, but I couldn’t.
But it isn’t fair to remember him, or anyone, just for his death. The museum does an excellent job of reminding visitors who Keats and his contemporaries were — that, though now they are all gone, they were once full of the gorgeous vibrancy of life, and created beautiful art that will never, ever die.
I learned that, despite the image we have today of a perpetually fragile and delicate Keats, he was a scrappy little guy in school, getting into many a fistfight before he discovered what good outlets reading and writing were. I learned how much he loved his siblings — he was the oldest, like me — and how much it devastated him when his little brother, Tom, died of tuberculosis at 19 (John had nursed him, as these were, of course, days before it was known to be contagious). I learned that, before he went to Rome to die, he charged his fiancée Fanny and his younger sister to always stay in touch, so they would have each other; and I learned that the two women did, and remained best friends for the rest of their long lives. I even saw a lock of his hair, and learned that despite my own vision of John Keats as a brooding brunette, he was, in fact, a towhead blonde.
Hardly anyone left that museum with a dry eye. It’s not easy subject matter, and they do an incredible job making it all come alive and feel real. But I left feeling hopeful, in a way, because what an incredible thing it is that so many people are still impacted by his story, and his art.
One older Italian woman, who was visiting at the same time as me, kept clutching her chest and rhapsodically saying, “oh, me amo Keats, me amo Keats.” I hope that, somehow, the wonder of the Eternal City allowed him to hear that, and to know how much he means.
•••
Perhaps knowing how reluctant I was to leave Italy, the universe conspired to keep me there an extra day. My plan to visit Bern, the capital of Switzerland, was foiled by weekend rail strikes on ItaliaRail, and I ended up stranded for a night in Milan.
It was quite the stroke of luck, because I absolutely loved Milan. More similar to Berlin than anywhere I visited in Italy, this city was like a hub of art, youth culture, and progressive modernity. I walked to the canal in the late afternoon to soak in the last light; there were young people smoking cigarettes atop brick walls covered in graffiti, and a street market full of vendors selling handmade gifts. I bought a pair of earrings for my sister, then wandered until after dark, trying to savor my last few hours here… this country I had come to love so much.
•••
Indeed, Italy was somewhere I had always known that I would love, but I guess I couldn’t have imagined how much. At the Keats-Shelley House, there was a list of American and British artists, writers, and thinkers who, at one point or another, made Rome their home, and it just went on and on. Longfellow, Dickens, Alcott, Browning, Copley, Ruskin. Keats, of course, though I know he must have wished it was under happier circumstances; still, he loved that view of the Spanish Steps, so much.
There’s just something about you, Italy, that inspires one to create, I think — and to make oneself at home. How else would I still be writing about you a month-and-a-half later, still thinking of you when I see my own home’s green hills, rolling countrysides, and olive trees?
•••
ROME
Activities: Visit the Colosseum and the Roman Forum (tip: plan ahead! the lines were excruciatingly long, and I didn’t have time to go in; buy tickets online so you can skip the lines). See the Trevi Fountain (tip: go in the morning, before the crowds arrive, or else you may have trouble even seeing much of that gorgeous, cool, clear water!). Go to the Keats-Shelley House and the Spanish Steps (this museum was so impactful and beautiful, and all in English; and the Spanish Steps are like their own separate world within Rome, just a gorgeous neighborhood).
My Best Meal: I only ate once in Rome, stopping in a little grocery and grabbing a salame and fontina panini. But let me tell you! That was one delicious panini. As with everywhere in Italy, there are a thousand restaurants every where you look and everyone is guaranteed to be amazing; wander off the main tourist tracks to find somewhere more affordable.
MILAN
My Hostel: QUO Milano / Cost: about 25 euros a night / Recommend?: Yes! Great common area, cute decor, nice room (we had our own bathroom, as well), and very affordable. It’s a tram ride from the train station, but all the main points of interest in the city are walking distance.
Activities: Go see the Milan Cathedral, walk by the canal, look closely at the street art, and talk to people (everyone was so kind in Milan).
My Best Meal: A Sicilian cannoli! One of the best desserts I had the entire trip. Stop into any given bakery as you walk the city, and I promise it will be delicious.

In my last article, I wrote about getting from FCO (Rome’s largest Airport) to Termini (Rome’s central train station which also serves as a major hub for Rome’s public transportation).
Of course, it leaves the question, “What if I arrive in Rome at the CIA (Ciampino Airport)?”
Great question, reader!
If you’re not familiar with budget flights by low-cost carriers like RyanAir, EasyJet, and the no-longer-bankrupt Norwegian Airlines, then let me offer a small introduction.
Your friend told you that they found a $5 flight from Paris to Berlin. “Crazy,” you think.
Then you go to Skyscanner (affiliate link) and find out that isn’t such a stretch.
In fact, I found an $11 flight from Paris’s BVA to Tangier, Morocco leaving October 13, 2022. This is just one of many examples.
“What a deal!” you think.

""Let me tell you about Rome, my beloved Roma, so ancient she is called eternal, the city that has always been and will always be. Assured of her own magnificence, her venerable significance, she does not seek comparison - and yet I find it almost impossible not to compare her.""
This is the opening of Mark Lamprell’s The Lovers' Guide to Rome and I fell in love with these words immediately. I was compelled to read them aloud, they have a wonderful lyrical quality to them.
Have you ever been to Rome? The author’s note says this novel was written outdoors, around the streets and piazzas of Rome and it shows. There is a lovely liveliness and intimacy in the treatment of these locations that took me right back there amongst the stone angels and gelato stands.
This book was given to me with the description that it was a ""happy book"". As most of my reading material tends toward more UNhappy themes, I thought this might be a nice (and mentally healthy) change.
I was pleasantly surprised. The Lovers' Guide to Rome is a lovely, breezy, sunlit romp through the streets of Roma, as comfortable and cheerful as the best rom-coms, but beautifully written, with descriptions that make you want to read them aloud. I found the cast of characters engaging, with enough about them to be curious about and sympathise with, to make me want to read on.
I zipped through the first half on this on a two hour train journey and it was ideal for the task. Because you shouldn't have to put up with poorly written junk just because you're in the mood for something light!

I was in Rome standing outside St. Peter’s basilica when a thought crossed my mind: Am I entering a church or a museum? I was perfectly at bliss standing in line to enter one of the most famous architecture in the world. As I wandered through its interior, the more confused I was. Can this be considered as an art gallery? I had musings in my head to fill a notebook.
I had little knowledge about the church. I was astounded to discover it has eight chapels, 24 altars, and about 40 statues. I was bowled over by its grandeur. The moment I looked up, it was hard to look down. Why would you? The hymns and prayers seemed to be coming from above.
Two reasons drew me to the place. One was the movie ‘Da Vinci Code’ starring Tom Hanks as the lead Robert Langdon; the other was my running away from my problems.
Though I was raised with an amalgamation of Islam, Catholicism, Hindu and Buddhism, the basilicas in Rome offered me comfort that remains inexplicable. They called to me. Maybe it was the beauty of their architecture that drew me to them like a moth to a flame. Some questions are best left unanswered.
All I knew was I had made it to Rome. I was finally at bliss looking up 60 feet towards the…

Get a good data plan. We used Google Maps to get around EVERYWHERE. So much simpler than asking people for directions. Google Maps tells you which station to walk to, which subway line/bus to board, how long until the next train/bus arrives and how much time it will take you to reach your destination. You can either apply for a local SIM or check with your existing mobile services provider about international roaming plans (we used Airtel, and took their 30-day plan).
Learn how to say ‘please’, ‘thank you’, ‘you’re welcome’, ‘excuse me’ and ‘sorry’ in the local language. Don’t bother walking around with a dictionary — nobody expects you to master a whole new language. However, people are appreciative of the fact that you can respond in a language they understand — especially when you find you have to push your way through a crowd when your train arrives at the stop you need to get off at (‘pardon, pardon, PARDON’). Once you’ve taught yourself the words, they will roll off your tongue automatically in the appropriate situation because you’ll hear people using them all around you.
Invest in travel passes. All three cities we visited had various options (1-day, 3-day and 7-day passes) that we could use for unlimited trips across different modes of transport including buses, trams, subway and local trains. This makes so much financial sense and saves you the pain of having to buy a ticket for each trip you make. In Rome and Berlin, we had to validate the pass for the first trip after which we just had to make sure we had it with us in case ticket checkers came by. In Paris, we had to validate the ticket each time we entered a subway station/ boarded a bus.
Plan out which attractions/sights are most important to YOU. There are just so many options today. Sure you can get on a bus and do the highlights, but that doesn’t work for everyone. I desperately wanted to visit the Palace of Versailles and that’s often not on a typical ‘what to see in Paris in 3 days’ list. We also managed to get tickets to a Katy Perry show in Berlin (we booked these about a month and a half before we actually left India!). I would have also loved to do a food tour, but we just didn’t have the time.
Have a rough idea of the top 3–4 things you want to do/see/experience well in advance. There are so many advantages to planning ahead. In a lot of cases, you can pre-book entrance tickets and print them out at home to save yourself time and money. This is super critical in cases like visiting the Eiffel Tower. You’ll see tons of ads from private operators charging you the sun, moon and stars for a visit to the second-floor or summit. If you plan ahead (and here I literally mean a month or two ahead), you can pre-book your Eiffel Tower experience for a fraction of the cost AND you can skip the long wait lines. Through this official site, tickets to the second floor (with lift access) cost 16 euros per head — that’s about $18 USD. A quick search for a private-operator led tour on Viator shows that this same experience costs $52. We managed to book afternoon tickets to the second floor (lift access) through the official site and it was totally worth it.
Same thing for our tour of the Colosseum in Rome. I was hell bent on booking the underground tour (with access to the arena floor) because I knew how much G loved ‘The Gladiator’, but the private-operator led tours were outrageously expensive. Then, I stumbled on this helpful post in a forum which led to the Colosseum’s own booking portal. Again — you need to book these well in advance because they sell out super quick but if you’re lucky (like me) you can book this amazing experience for an super price!
Sign up for a walking tour (or two). We signed up for Sandeman’s FREE tour of Paris and enjoyed it so much that we signed up for a paid walking tour of the Montmartre neighbourhood the next day. These are often a couple of hours long, so make sure you wear comfortable clothing (preferably layers that you can take off/put on depending on the weather) and very comfortable footwear! Walking tours are simply the best way to see a place, and if you do them early on in your trip, you can decide on which places you may want to come back see in more detail. Plus, they’re pretty reasonably priced.
Pre-download free audio guide applications and content. Wherever we didn’t employ the services of a guide, we used Rick Steve’s free walking tour app on our iPhones. His audio guides are informative and interesting — for instance, I discovered (through one of content pieces in the Berlin walking tour guide) that Michael Jackson’s infamous ‘dangling baby’ incident happened at the balcony of a room at the Hotel Adlon just outside The Brandenburg Gate! The other smart decision we made was downloading all the apps and app content offered by The Palace of Versailles (including audio guides for the Trianons and the Gardens). You actually get an audio guide device with your ticket, but it’s a tiny recorder like device with no earphones and the apps actually have the same content but in better quality. Also, the audio guide offered with the ticket doesn’t cover the Trianons and Gardens. Another tip at Versailles? Buy a round trip ticket for the Petit Train. Otherwise, you’ll have to spend an inordinate amount of time walking from the Palace, across the gardens and grounds to the Grand Trianon and then the Petit Trianon.
And perhaps my most important piece of advice:
Choose your travel partner wisely. I’m incredibly lucky to have found a partner who loves discovering new things (be it food, drinks or experiences) at the same pace as I do. He gives me the lead to do the planning, and I thrive in this role :) And then he surprises me with things like spontaneous tickets to a show at the Moulin Rouge and so much more. So thank you, G, for being the amazing person that you are! Here’s to more adventures together ❤
Other little bits of advice:
> Figure out the tipping culture — carry a few Euros in change for this> Carry a small backpack with your water, an umbrella, sunscreen, your passport (safely tucked away), and some money (our credit cards worked everywhere) aside from other essentials (charger, tissues etc). Your bag will be screened at most attractions, so don’t carry too many electronics or too large a bag> Watch out for street vendors/hawkers trying to get you buy stuff by catching you off guard (like by giving you a high-five and shoving something into your hand)> Not every touristy thing is overrated. Case in point: the hot chocolate at Angelina in Paris. Walking down the Kurfürstendamm in Berlin. Eating gelato in Rome. The view from the second floor of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Snacking on currywurst and tucking into a schnitzel in Berlin. Looking up at the oculus in the Pantheon in Rome. The first view of the Sacré-Cœur as you walk up the hill in Paris. Everything about the Palace of Versailles ;)

Walking through the Rome Streets.
I promised in my previous article about our trip to Italy to write about each city in deeper thoughts and suggestions for a travel plan. First, as it was on a trip, I will write about Rome, then I hope you will also see articles about Florence and Venice.
If you read my travel articles, you know, I am very organized in planning and do my research very thoughtfully starting from the choices of areas and hotels to stay, tickets to museums and must visit places, reservations needed to try restaurants, gem spots, to learning the art and history of the place. It definitely takes time, and I am more than happy to share this knowledge with you.
Interested in my travel plans? Just email to see.feel.like@gmail.com. I will share them with you for free.
I said in my Planning Trip to Italy article, Rome was the city that still stands as an unclosed book and open to think about, and I am definitely willing to come back to see more and get deeper knowledge of this city.
My partner and I spent just 3 days in Rome, and I think it is a good amount of time for the first time traveling, especially if you are limited in time and want to see other regions and cities in your travel time.

One of my favourite travel writing clichés is “the city where East meets West!” I’ve seen it written about everywhere from Vienna to Hong Kong, St Petersburg to Tbilisi, Beirut to Berlin, and basically every decent-sized city in Central Asia. One of these days, I’m expecting to see a picture of Dublin with spice markets and mosques and the headline “Ireland — America’s Gateway to the Orient!”
But I have to admit that if it were to be used for anywhere, the city most deserving of the title would be Istanbul. Unlike most other claimants, Istanbul is split in two not just culturally, but geographically; the city straddles both Europe and Asia. This is a useful piece of pub quiz trivia, but also shaped the city for the past two millennia — Istanbul, for most of its history, was the most strategically important city on Earth.
2700 years ago, Greek explorers consulted the Oracle at Delphi, who told them that they would found a city opposite the Land of the Blind. When they came across the fishing town of Chalcedon, they couldn’t understand how the Chalcedonians had missed the perfect natural harbour right across the water. Then it came to them: these Chalcedonians must be the blind ones…

A Day in the Life:
When in Rome
First and foremost, if you have chosen to learn about life in Rome by reading this blog, thank you for taking the time to do so!
This region is home to my dream vacation. This is because one of my best friends, Beatrice, happens to be a Native of the region who lives there with her family. I met her during our senior year of high school (she was a foreign-exchange student) and we have been great friends communicating via Facebook and WhatsAp ever since. I promised her that some day I would go visit her in Rome…but for now, I am a college student attempting to make ends meet to pay for school, therefore, this blog is the closest I will get to Italy for a while. Regardless of my inability to pay the $1,000 for a plane ticket, this blog will give me the opportunity to study life in Rome so that I will know exactly what I would like to do the moment I step foot there.
My goals for this blog are both personal and involve you, as the audience. Like previously stated, I would like to learn more about the region in order to prepare myself for a future trip to visit Beatrice. On a larger scale, however, my goal is to help educate my followers through this blog so that if they plan to travel to Rome, are thinking about planning a vacation, or need an emergency get away from college/final exams, they will be adequately informed about the region.
If you know anything about Rome from your schooling, it is likely that you know Rome’s history is anything but brief. I will do my best to summarize it in a short paragraph or two for you.
Basically, Rome was one of the greatest empires there ever was- if looking at it from an ancient sort of perspective. As you can see from the timeline, Rome lasted a bit longer than the average civilization back in the day. This is largely due to the fact that Rome was home to many powerful leaders, conquerors, and other highly intelligent individuals. Just a few of these include: Ceasar (his war tactics are still studied and taught today), Augustus (built many roads, aqueducts, and buildings), and Mark Antony (had an intimate relationship with the Egyptian ruler Cleopatra-he stabbed himself for her, she let a snake bite her for him-it’s a long story for a different time). In summary, the Romans were a power you didn’t want to threaten or mess with. You would only be setting yourself up for defeat-unless, of course, you were the Franks from Germany who defeated them between AD 406–419.
So what is it with the Colosseum as a Roman symbol?
The Colosseum, as pictured at the top of this blog post, was built following the rule of Nero, an extra crazy ruler who basically ran the morale of the Roman peoples into the ground. The ruler who followed Nero, Vespasian, decided that building the Colosseum for the purpose of free entertainment (gladiator games) would benefit the people of Rome by bringing up their morale, and that it did.
Today, the Colosseum still stands with a few alterations and additions after its original design in approximately 73–75 A.D. It is noteworthy that the Roman architecture and design techniques used to build the magnificent building are still being used in various buildings in the modern world.
While ancient Roman culture is still evident in this amazing city, Rome has modernized itself to keep up with the current times. If one were to visit today, it would be something like…
Vatican City
Vatican City, while it is technically a city state and not a part of Rome, falls within the Roman boarder. It is home to approximately 840 people, one of those being the Pope, the leader of the Catholic Church. This city state also happens to contain some of the main tourist attractions in Rome including St. Peter’s Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, and the Vatican Museums.
Shopping
According to http://www.rome.info/shopping/, when one is shopping in Rome, they can expect to break the bank. One positive side to shopping in the tourist city, however, is that leather products such as purses, shoes, and belts, are commonly found for a fair price. (Being a purse-lover myself, I now know I need to save up for more than just my plane ticket!)
Another important thing to remember if you are used to the United States’ way of shopping is that the hours are generally a bit off from what you may be used to. Evidently, they open around 9:00AM and close again for lunch around 1:00PM. They then open up from 3:30PM-7:30PM. These hours are different, however, for Sundays and Monday mornings and may also be different depending on the type of shop.
*Note: If the purpose of your trip is heavily dependent upon the shopping, do not go to Rome during August. During this month, most shops and restaurants close for about a two week period while shop owners take their annual holiday.
Restaurants
Yes, Rome happens to be in Italy so you’re probably thinking, “Well duh! While in Italy, order Italian!” If you love spaghetti or pizza, then I can see why you would prefer to purchase the “real deal.” One thing I will tell you, however, is make sure to order some gelato for dessert!
Gelato, the Italian version of ice cream, is made with milk, cream, different sugars, and nut and fruit purees for flavor. Generally, the consensus is that gelato is amazing and American ice cream comes second. If you are a bit of a health nut like me, you will also be happy to know that gelato tends to contain less calories, fat, and sugar than typical ice cream.
According to http://www.expatfocus.com/expatriate-rome-language, the main language spoken in Rome is Italian. Luckily, if you are an individual who is not bilingual-like me-and English is your only language, Rome is a great place for you to travel to a different country without having to suffer the consequences of butchering a new language. (Go to Rome and you won’t have your friends laugh at you for accidentally ordering grilled guinea pig to pair with your pasta and side salad-it’s a thing!) This is because the people of Rome are aware that a large part of their economy depends on tourism so many of them living in the areas known for the tourist attractions speak English. In other words, as far as verbal communication goes you should be able to survive without hiring a translator.
If you do want to throw just a bit of Italian into your experience, however, feel free to say “ciao” (pronounced like “chow” in “puppy chow”). This means “hello” and can also translated to “goodbye,” depending on the context.
In terms of nonverbal communication, however, communicating in Rome is a different story. After spending much time with my friend Beatrice in high school, she became annoyed with my “silly American ways,” as she called them. According to her, Romans are very physical in a way that we Americans might see as boarder-line suggestive/sexual. Apparently, it is completely common to let your friends (male or female) sit on your lap when hanging out, give long hugs to friends, and the custom greeting (even with strangers) is a short embrace with a kiss on each cheek.
Another way the Romans communicate physically is by frequently motioning. Beatrice often coached me (as a bit of a joke) how to “speak with my hands.” If something is delicious, you indicate that with your hands because your mouth is full. If you want someone to hurry up, you tap your wrist like a watch. Basically if you want to go to Italy and your goal is to blend in, you had better learn the equivalent of sign language.
www.nytimes.com
As I sit here and finish up this blog post (while drinking a glass of wine from Italy ironically-Risata il Rosso-you should try it!), my final thoughts to you are this: if you ever want to learn about a country or a culture, the best way to go about it is to go there. Cultural immersion, as they call it, is essential to learning and life experience. While you might be held back by lack of funds or a chaotic schedule, I strongly suggest making a solid effort to get outside of your box. Force yourself to be uncomfortable but most importantly, go into any experience with an open mind. You won’t regret it.

Right at the beginning, I have to admit that I am part of the problem I am complaining about. We have visited Rome on a cruise, and I suspect that the explosion of cruise tourism has a significant role to play in the flood of tourists in Rome.
My wife and I booked the cruise almost eighteen months ago. At that time we were not yet aware of the problems caused by this form of tourism. Greta Thunberg was still an unknown student somewhere in Norway, and the cruise theme had not yet arrived in our consciousness.
Besides the vast CO2 emissions per passenger, the biggest problem of the cruise industry in Europe is the limited capacity of many ports of destination of the gigantic ships.
Places like Skala on Santorini, Venice, or Stavanger are regularly visited by large cruise ships with 2,000 to 4,000 passengers — sometimes several in one day.
Rome is not directly by the sea, but from the nearest port in Civitavecchia, large bus fleets with cruise ship passengers drive daily to the Italian capital.

I moved from one cultural landmark to another, trying not to get sunstroke. The morning started with a saving cup of coffee near Tivoli station. Then, a quick escape into the coolness of the cathedrals.
I was struck by the young men and women who sat alone in churches for long periods. Some knelt in prayer. Such beautiful, delicate bodies, already asking God for forgiveness for their indulgence in love.
Here, temptation came too easily.
Having feasted my eyes on the works of Raphael and Michelangelo, I looked around, searching for someone to channel this overwhelming creative energy into. Among the group of tourists stood a petite girl in a flowing white maxi skirt.
Her hair was darker than pitch, and her blue eyes closely followed the guide’s gestures. I noticed the delicate frame beneath her light white blouse.
She noticed me too. (Of course, I had been looking at her so intently!)
“It’s so wonderful to be here!” she said. “I’m an artist! I came to Rome for inspiration!”
She didn’t even need to say it. It was obvious.
She loved life the way the great painters of the Vatican did — Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Raphael Santi. Their works were a triumph of life itself. And standing before Peter Wenzel’s “Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden”, I realized — we were meant to meet here.
Feeling my desire to be closer, she quickly decided to make me her personal photographer to observe me better.
“Take a photo of me by that pinecone in the Cortile della Pigna!” she teased.
She posed and turned, again and again. It was obvious — I was already captivated.
Then she sighed:
“How will I go to the Villa Borghese alone now? Who will take my pictures?”
I was more than happy to go!
She sat in the metro as if in a sauna — flushed, damp, squeezed between two sturdy men pressing against her from either side. It was a new painting — her, in tight quarters, in the stifling heat.
But she looked only at me. Without blinking.
Melted by the art of the Borghese Gallery, she came alive. Several times, she leaned in, drowning me in the sweet scent of her perfume, explaining this or that masterpiece.
“Sacred and Profane Love” by Titian.
“Do you see how different they are, yet they share the same painting?” she asked.
I also found myself drawn to Correggio’s ‘Danaë’. Instinctively, I compared the beauty next to me to the legendary princess, draped in nothing but fate itself. From this perspective, Cranach the Elder’s ‘Venus and Cupid’ intrigued me as well.
Stepping outside, surrounded by the intoxicating scent of pine, she declared:
“Photograph me however you like!”
I wanted her to lie down on a stone bench, among the ancient Roman statues.
I hadn’t expected her to be so bold.
A true artistic soul. Intriguing was an understatement.
We dined at a café facing the Pantheon.
After the second glass of wine, she asked:
“Have you ever been in love?” (God, why do women always ask this question?)
I hesitated.
She downed her wine, clinked glasses with me in a brotherhood toast, and said:
“Let’s go for a walk!”
That night is impossible to forget.
By midnight, we realized that finding a taxi in Rome was nearly impossible. I felt like a gladiator, returning from a victorious battle, carrying her in my arms along the Roman Forum, nearly out of strength.
Her soft body could be traced through the gentle folds of fabric.
Strangely, she never let me kiss her that night.
Surviving, I left for Florence, but my mind stayed with her.
I visited its stunning cathedrals, the Uffizi Gallery, and Palazzo Pitti. My hotel room was small, but the bright moon watched over me, reminding me of her.
We often texted, and then, one day, she came — for half a day only.
This time, she looked different.
She realized that Florence and Rome were two entirely different worlds.
No longer dressed in white, but in deep blue.
Her hair, once tied in a tight bun, was now let loose, cascading like the curls of Botticelli’s Venus.
Every strand carried a message — an echo of past centuries, where every glance could become a masterpiece, every movement — art in itself.
Two days passed, but it felt like a lifetime. We walked a little.
“I think about you often,” I admitted.
“So do I,” she replied.
When I returned to Rome, I immediately arranged to meet her at the Spanish Steps.
She looked breathtaking in her evening dress and lace-up heels.
“By the way,” she said, “I was invited for a scooter ride across Rome tonight. But since you’re here, I want to spend the evening with you.”
Women love sitting in restaurants, don’t they? Have you ever noticed?
We ordered plenty of wine and braised pork in white wine.
At some point, her image started to blur in my mind, as if she had hypnotized me.
“God, I can’t keep up with you!” I admitted.
“Walk me to my hotel,” she said.
Her legs rested on the red leather couch.
Looking at me intently, she spoke about random things, but in reality, she was deciding the fate of the night.
How she decided — let that remain our little Italian secret.
What I can say is that Italy will always stay with me — vivid, alluring, unashamedly in love with life, gifting the world its greatest art: the art of love.
Every moment spent with Ni unveils new dimensions of grace and mystery. Dive deeper into her world in:
Silent Observer

To meet WHO…? That was the question posed to me by my mother not but a day or two ago. I’d just explained my intention to treat this trip to Italy differently and make a few unfamiliar stops in a slow arc toward the Adriatic coast from Rome as opposed to the beeline I’ve been mapping religiously each visit this year. It must have seemed odd to have encouraged such wide-eyed curiosity from her.
Although I know I shouldn’t, I still find myself confused that others don’t share the love of solo travel (and especially withOUT plans) like I do.
So here I am now, at the initiation of day two in Italy, driving the hour from Poli, a small countryside village an hour outside of Roma to L’Aquila, a town in the smack center of the country, easily found by someone blindfolded and effectively the midpoint traversing from one coast to the other.
This morning as the sound of donkeys honking just outside my window nearly wake me, I choose to lay comfortably in bed a bit longer. After finally deciding to start my day remembering I’m alone in Italy — my “happy place” — I check my phone to learn I had managed to sleep in until 11:30 in the morning. Like a madman, I think for a moment the clock is wrong. I jump to freshen up and begin my saunter to the kitchen to find coffee before beginning the journey to my next adventure.
Day one was truly a reminder that going into travel with no expectations may be the best life hack ever invented. I selected my first night in Poli purely based on the fact that it was only an hour drive outside of where I would land in Roma Fiumicino. And I know from experience that the 3-hour drive to the coast is not exactly what I enjoy doing after an 8-hour redeye over the Atlantic. So I chose the house on the hill described as the “studio among the olive trees” from my AirBnB options. I had no idea what I was signing up for was joining a pseudo family for the night. I was greeted with offers to walk the donkeys, meet the dogs, the cat, and try foods I’d never seen in real life. I was given a private tour of a heart-stoppingly stunning municipal building covered in wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling watercolor-like frescoes by someone who clearly saw the interior only as an excuse for art.
Fully prepared to go out to dinner and eat alone that night, as I do quite frequently traveling through Italy by myself, I am delighted to receive an offer instead to join the family for dinner including a German friend stereotypically named Klaus. Recently in pensione, he had purchased and remodeled a villa/castle just up the road from where the couple lived. He is thrilled to have the opportunity to get back to English, a language that comes with fewer tongue ties than his intro-level Italian. We spend the evening eating chicory greens, oven-baked potatoes perfectly crisp, and some kind of delectable deconstructed meatballs so light they seem to melt in my mouth rendering chewing an obsolete ritual. We wash it down with a deliciously dry white wine from the Lazio region then a perfectly strong Grappa also from Lazio then, of course, no meal is complete without a shot of espresso. And just as I wonder whether this last sip could keep me up all night, I recall I had been traveling for over 24 hours, and everything would work out just fine.
This morning, as I wake nearly to the lunch hour, this time it is no surprise that I am invited to the adjacent kitchen to enjoy a breakfast cookie and coffee with my new family before hitting the road. I nibble on my flower-shaped homemade biscotti thinking how impossible it seems that they so easily disintegrate as they touch my tongue, overhearing conversations by the old gentleman on his phone discussing his methodology for recognizing whether or not mushrooms found in the local forests are safe and spicy or not. As he hangs up he gesture-explains the practice of taking a small nibble of mushrooms then rubbing them against his wrist as a test and how funny it is to watch people walking around biting and spitting down the line while hunting funghi through the woods.
I take my last mouthful of caffè and wish I could steal every recipe I can get my hands on. I’m told a quick story of a local cookie made only of flour, sugar, and wine and imagine war-time Italy as a nonstop show of Chopped, only better.
Reluctantly, I say my farewells, including at least 15 to 20 thank you’s and goodbyes. I promise a future stop that might involve my real family someday for the opportunity to sit down for a grand meal again. I step into my rental car and begin my exit as the automatic gate opens slowly in front of me. My phone connects to the Bluetooth and a song sets the tone for my travels. Sia sings to me that she has no dollar bills and loves cheap thrills. I giggle realizing I hadn’t spent a penny since arrival given the way my Italian hosts had taken me in and refused me to cover so much as the one euro glass of Prosecco we’d enjoyed as an aperitivo the night before. I smirk reflecting on the fact that having a lifestyle involving a solo trip to Italy more than four times a year is nothing short of luxury.
It’s a cloudy day and I begin my drive through the seemingly hand-chiseled road from Poli to the autostrada. My soundtrack turns to classical music as my phone shuffles to the next track. I imagine being in some sort of cheeky Italian car commercial… Pretty girl drives away speedily, stick-shifting through the Italian hillside as high energy strings harmonize in the background. A Lancia logo covers the scene and the tagline reads — You too can be an escape artist.
It’s nearly lunch now, even though I can still taste the coffee from moments ago. I am more than ready to clean a plate or two of whatever the next trattoria I find may be able to offer. I’ll stick to no expectations. All I know is that where I’m headed I’ve never been. And with no one I’ve ever met. Surrounded by things I’ve never seen. Stepping away someone I am not now.
Andiamo.

“From tourist to pilgrim”. This is an excellent name for a project organised by the Pantheon as a welcome service. I first visited Rome ten years ago as a reluctant tourist, fully aware that I was not ready explore its riches, and that the two days I had to spend there could not do it justice.
I return as a true pilgrim of Western Civilisation, its art and its history. Just like a pilgrim of days past, I must suffer long distances, pilfering conmen both small-scale and large, in a faraway, unfamiliar land, and deal with the vagaries of local cuisines like sugary croissants and exotic, unfamiliar pastas. Indeed it was only after travelling in Italy that I even realised what I had known as “Italian cuisine” hardly exists in Italy, with regional cuisines changing dramatically over just a few hours’ train journey.
I had spent so much time in the last decade reading about and watching documentaries and videos on Rome and its art, it was a strange feeling to physically walk across the Tiber on the Ponte Sant’Angelo surrounded by Bernini’s angels, gazing at della Porta’s dome of St Peter’s Basilica looming over the horizon.
The long straight sweeping boulevard makes for an imposing entry, with the view of the basilica and its dome bordered by the buildings on the side of that grand avenue. Surprisingly though, I thought it looked much smaller than expected upon reaching the Piazza designed by Bernini. As the Roman buildings fall behind and the symmetrical colonnades bracketing the vast piazza emerge, it is almost surprising to see the basilica does not extend further.
Perhaps this is an example of the mind’s tendency to exaggerate expectations of the dimensions of things it has held in high esteem, but the basilica feels dwarfed by the expansiveness of the piazza. Bernini’s use of space overshadows Michelangelo’s magnificent jewel box. Or perhaps this impact is due to the sweeping boulevard leading up to it, built by Mussolini in the age of the automobile. As one moves closer to the basilica and it looms larger, expectations crescendo, and it feels as though one is only looking at a part of it, and that the building must extend to the sides.
Once inside however, the dimensions reset, and the pilgrim is hit by the full force of the splendour of counterreformation Baroque in all its glory. It is a convincing utilisation of the power of art to dazzle 16th century Europe into accepting the Roman Church’s claims to divine authority.
St Peter’s basilica is ostensibly a shrine to the apostle Peter, or to God, or whatever the assertions of Catholic theology claim. To me, and I suspect to many modern visitors, this is a shrine to Bernini and Michelangelo, as well as the other saints of Baroque art whose genius adorns the basilica.
Is this the broader fate of churches in Europe? As the number of sincere worshippers in the pews dwindle and are replaced by tourists and pilgrims of art and history, churches are turning into living museums and art galleries. Many churches seem to be accepting of this trend, trying to indirectly monetise their art collections.
For example, the Church of St Ignatius Loyola has a mirror and coin-operated lights for visitors wanting to admire its dramatic, jaw-droppingly beautiful fresco. One would imagine the price of €1 for around 60 seconds of light, must be sufficient to pay for the maintenance of the fresco and perhaps other parts of the church. When I was there, there was even soft, calming spa music playing in the background. Bernini’s magnificent Ecstacy of St. Theresa also has a similar coin-operated lighting system though it is not absolutely necessary to admire the work.
At St Peter’s and other sites in Rome, I often thought of Sir Kenneth Clark’s quips and insights in his Civilisation documentary. I tried to follow the contours of Michelangelo’s basilica that “carries the eye round as if it were the carving of a torso”, though I could not get very far before being herded back to the constricted tourist path by an attendant.
The Sistine Chapel is still the holiest site of Western art, and therefore perhaps of Western Civilisation itself. The thrill of seeing in real life some of the most iconic images of the world continues beyond Michelangelo’s Creation of Man as one progresses on life’s journey through the world of art and literature.
Even if you know certain works of art live in certain museums or churches, there is still a thrill when you actually encounter them, since you never know precisely where in the museum or church they are, and their first sight is always a surprise. My highlight was stumbling upon Proust’s Odette de Crécy in Botticelli’s Life of Moses on the southern wall — the melancholy face of Zipporah that makes a suave, intelligent, highly eligible Parisian dandy fall in love with a courtesan because of her resemblance to the daughter of Jethro.
I fell in love with the Baroque in the Germanic lands and made the pilgrimage to Rome in large part to visit the birthplace of the Baroque, which was born out of the Catholic Church’s resolution to use the power of art to woo back worshippers to fight back against the Protestant reformation. I was amply rewarded with its many Baroque treasures, some more famous than others.
However, I was also surprised to discover I sometimes found it more difficult to enjoy the beauty of churches in Rome, for several reasons.
Firstly, it is more difficult to overlook the destructive role of early Christianity in classical Rome and its conflicts with paganism. The majestic ruins of the Roman fora are too close to not feel them stoically bearing witness to the desecration of their holy Pantheon, where even after 1,500 years the church feels like an invasive occupier, out of place in the naturalistic, circular architecture where the oculus offers nature-worshippers a direct communion with the sky. The niches of the dome once adorned with sculptures of pagan Roman deities look achingly empty.
This sense of loss is not felt in the Germanic baroque, perhaps because either there was nothing comparable before, or if there was, it has been lost to history. There are no churches built over destroyed temples to Thor that we know of, even if there were probably Roman temples in Vindobona, the Roman military camp that became Vienna.
After all, it was at the medieval church on Capitoline Hill nearby, where barefoot friars walked in the former temple of Juno, that Edward Gibbon was inspired to write The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.
My art pilgrimage trail took me from the Pantheon to Bernini’s fountain of the four rivers at the Piazza Navona, where I stumbled upon the basilica of St Agnes in Agone, another site whose history forces the visitor to remember the clash of early Christianity with European paganism. The baroque church is said to be built on the site of the tomb of the martyred saint, believed to have been tortured and killed by pagan Roman authorities.
Here I discovered the second reason why it can sometimes be more difficult to enjoy Roman baroque. At least in this instance, it is too transparent in its attempt to use the power of visual art to dazzle people into faith, and into submission to the authority of the Roman Church. The origin of baroque art was utilitarian, to be a tool of the counterreformation, but this seems to be one of its more crude and least convincing applications. Perhaps the Baroque had to go through these phases in its Roman birthplace before maturing into its more impressive stages. At St Agnes of Agone, a certain lack of sincerity, feeling, and faith seeps through the frescos of overly dramatic animated figures looking down at you with theatrically exaggerated emotions, matched by equally exaggerated expressions carved in marble in a grand and opulently designed space that exhibits the unmasked power and wealth of the so-called Catholic Church.
This is the third impediment to enjoying the Roman baroque: the flagrant corruption of the Roman church is so ubiquitous, it is impossible to avert one’s eyes from it in Rome. The Latin name of the Borgia family, which has become a byword for licentiousness and rapaciousness, “Borghesis”, is still vainly stamped across St Peter’s entablature (the technical term for the part below the pediment, the triangular gable). It makes it very difficult for any reasonable outsider to take its spiritual claims seriously, creating a dissonance with its aesthetic richness.
Palaces stamped with the names of royal families are de rigour and to be expected, but churches defaced with the names of aristocratic families?
Beauty, utility and politics
It must be one of the biggest hoaxes ever perpetrated in history. With a few exceptions, the papacy was held by the eminent Italian aristocratic families of the day, who successfully fooled all of western Europe for 300 or years, and southern Europe for another 300 odd years, into believing their claims to divine authority, in addition to the temporal authority they held as wealthy noblemen and princes, wearing not merely a crown and commanding armies, but also claiming to be the divinely-ordained representative of Christ on earth.
It is a hoax that is humoured even today by the legal and diplomatic recognition of 44ha of the Roman neighbourhood surrounding St Peter’s, as a sovereign nation state, simply because the Roman church still refuses to accept the authority of any government, and has too many devoted followers all around the world that governments need to appease.
Render unto Caesar what belongs to Caesar? Not the pope, who is still Caesar in his own microstate, which has its own train station and postal service, and where visitors without a ticket or special dispensation are only allowed as far as Bernini’s piazza and, if you ask the border guard nicely, one small street to visit a church. Countries still spend taxpayer funds maintaining embassies specifically to the Vatican, which visitors pass by on their way. Admittedly, it would be a rounding error for countries like Canada or the United Kingdom, but surely, Nigerian taxpayer funds can be better spent than on renting an office and employing staff to maintain a separate mission to the Holy See, in addition to the embassy to Italy. The Roman Catholic Church remains the only religious denomination in the world to control its own territory legally beyond the reach of any nation state.
This confrontation with the historical context of the Baroque forces me to examine my own attraction to it.
Although many centuries and a culture removed from the target audience of illiterate European peasants the art was targeted at to win over their hearts and minds , I must confess, I have always wanted to be dazzled by the power of art unleashed by the Catholic Church.
Admiring the awe-inspiring fresco of St Ignatius Loyola, I consider, why not? What’s wrong with wanting to have one’s eyes caressed by such extravagant beauty?
The mind protests nonetheless: did the Roman Church not effectively abuse art and its power to pursue its own political power? Was it that different to the propaganda of unsavoury regimes in world history? Or perhaps the use of convincing, alluring imagery used by cigarette companies in their advertising, like Marlboro Man?
Perhaps.
However, I would argue that the effect of good Baroque art, and its ability to stir awe and something deeper in us even today, shows that at a certain level, the power of art is one that cannot be controlled for human ends — it stays with the art as an independent force, regardless of who unleashed it, or their motives.
Perhaps the artist, the creator, is more like a shaman able to invoke the spirit, the life force that true art is. Once unleashed, it retains its own power regardless of the shape it has been given, the identity of the shaman-artists or their intentions. True beauty, and the art that bears it, transcends such worldly matters.
Beauty cannot be intellectualised, rationalised or indeed even moralised, and neither can the best exemplars of art, which can sometimes almost become synonymous with beauty. It was an inspired decision for a religious authority like the Catholic Church to use this transcendental power of art to give their believers a glimpse into the afterlife.
In truth, the theology behind the art does not really matter, nor do the stories being told by the art. Rather, it is in the emotional effect these works of art have on the viewer, that the power of art lies, and which transcends the artist, patron and their motives and beliefs.
It is true that experiencing this power may have convinced many a German or Italian peasant of the very legitimacy of the political power of the Catholic Church, and helped to gloss over its corruption.
Nonetheless, I can experience the same power centuries later as a pilgrim of art, and get a glimpse into the Transcendent, or in the words of Baudelaire, get an “inkling of the glories that lie beyond the grave.”
Western Civilisation as the Rises and Falls of Romes
Climbing Michelangelo’s staircase to the top of Capitoline Hill, one takes in a landscape drenched in history. Elegant domes of Baroque churches seem to rise phoenix-like from the vast Roman ruins, which “even after three centuries in which they were used as quarries, and in which our sense of scale has expanded, they still are surprisingly big.”
As the heart of the ancient Roman Empire, Capitoline Hill has retained its mystique through the centuries as a symbolic focal point of Western Civilisation, especially in its political manifestations. Even today, its memories linger on symbolically in almost every modern Western nation.
Monarchs through the last two millennia have styled themselves after the Roman Emperors, depicted with laurel wreaths in portraits, including on modern coins struck in the name of Queen Elizabeth II. German and Russian emperors literally called themselves Caesar (i.e. Kaiser and Tsar in their languages) until 1918, and Germany even called itself the Holy Roman Empire until 1806, despite never actually ruling Rome. Roman eagles are still the symbols of governments from Russia to Poland, Germany, France, and the United States of America, the republic which openly modelled itself on Rome, even building its own Capitol Hill.
Trajan’s Column stands nearby, and I notice its similarity to the column in what I think is Paris’s most beautiful and certainly most storied town “square”, Place Vendome. To digress, it is technically an octagon, and Chanel’s watches pay homage to its shape. The original Trajan column in ancient Rome had a statue of Emperor Trajan, which at some point went missing and was replaced by a statue of St. Peter. Meanwhile Napoleon’s likeness still stands atop the Vendome column, dressed as an ancient Roman emperor, crowned with laurels.
Outside the world of power and politics, even Lufthansa calls one of the premium tiers of its loyalty program “Senator”. The list of Rome’s influence on the modern world goes on.
Rome is truly the eternal city. Arguably the ruins and the inspiration of their legacy are as historically significant as the empire itself. Ever since Rome, every time a Western polity rose to greatness or sought to project greatness in the eyes of the world, it did so in the garb of Rome. In some ways then, the story of Western Civilisation is the story of successive rises and falls of Romes in different parts of Europe and North America.
Today, it is possible to survey the sweep of history at the Capitoline hill in Rome and behold the eras that have left their signatures in the language of architecture, in this vast open-air guestbook of Time.
The sheer scale of ruins from antiquity are indeed awe-inspiring, and it is perhaps not difficult to empathise with the many generations who have felt dwarfed by its achievements. According to Christopher Clark, the people of the dark ages were crushed by the scale of the ruins left behind by the Roman Empire and could not believe they were the work of men, treating them as natural phenomena “like mountains, and built their huts in them, as who should take advantage of a ravine or sheltering escarpment”.
The achievements of antiquity continued to weigh on artists like Henry Fuseli into the late 18th century, as expressed in his drawing The Artist’s Despair Before the Grandeur of Ancient Ruins, depicting the colossal hand of Constantine found in the Capitoline museum.
The early Christian era is represented on Capitoline Hill by the cavernous but in the grand scheme of churches not especially impressive, Romanesque Basilica of Santa Maria in Ara Coeli, where inspiration struck Gibbon to write his Decline and Fall.
The most beautiful part of the Capitoline Hill is still Michelangelo’s circular piazza with its hypnotising, almost tantric pattern around it, and the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius standing in the middle, the “only one ancient Emperor to remain above ground in the sunshine through the centuries”.
Michelangelo’s piazza and its humanist dimensions shows the confidence of the giants of the Renaissance, who “bursting with vitality and confidence, were not in a mood to be crushed by antiquity. They meant to absorb it, to equal it, to master it.”
Its timeless elegance, and the simplicity of its humanist splendour maintain a quiet dignity despite being overshadowed by the most recent attempt of an era to leave its mark on the Capitoline Hill, the enormous Vittoriano monument from the late 19th and early 20th century.
It still physically dominates the landscape today, newer, bigger and shinier than Michelangelo’s piazza. But in the topographical history book that is Rome, it can also look like a signpost of the wrong turn that Western Civilisation took in the late 19th century, which paved the way to the catastrophes of the 20th.
The historicist Vittoriano certainly houses many works of beauty and is like a modern rendition of an enormous marble Roman temple, dedicated to the Italian fatherland. However, it relies a bit too heavily on size to assert dominance and demand visual attention, perhaps revealing the insecurity and brashness of the late 19th century and its newly unified Italian state that first commissioned it. A cynic may even argue it was an attempt to make up in sculpture for Italy’s failures in the battlefield.
Perhaps I am too much in thrall to 19th century Italy’s arch rival, the Habsburg Empire (see my love letter to Vienna). Despite my deep love of Italy’s culture, history, language, cuisine and its people, I have always struggled to extend that awe to its history as a modern nation state.
“Great nations write their autobiographies in three manuscripts: the book of their deeds, the book of their words and the book of their art. Not one of these books can be understood unless we read the two others, but of the three the only trustworthy one is the last”, wrote John Ruskin.
Italy’s book of its art is the finest in Europe and perhaps the world, but if my Italian friends can forgive me for saying so, the book of its deeds is a bit less impressive
For much of its modern history, Italy lay at the crossroads of rival European powers and was always governed by a multitude of political entities, with the North often a political chessboard where the great French-Austrian rivalry played out. Metternich famously described Italy as merely a geographical expression.
Ultimately, Italy could achieve unification only as a fortuitous by-product of French and especially Prussian campaigns to weaken the Austrian Empire, with most of their own military attempts ending in failure.
What should a visitor make of the Vittoriano? It is an altar to the fatherland in the form of a memorial to Vittorio Emanuele II, whose enormous equestrian statue takes centre stage, echoing that of Marcus Aurelius in the neighbouring piazza. The Savoyard monarch became the first king of a unified Italy in 1867, but this required assistance from both France, as well as Prussia, who defeated the Austrians in the faraway Silesian plains of Königgratz. As a result, they had to cede the parts of the Veneto region they had successfully defended against the Italians until then.
Ignoring the technicality that Italy has never truly unified because of the hole in its capital city from the Vatican insisting on its temporal sovereignty, the unified Kingdom of Italy only lasted 79 years, a split second in Roman historical terms, before the monarchy was abolished in a relatively close referendum in 1946, with the republicans winning 54% of the vote, mostly in the wealthy north of the country. The king was exiled, and his male descendants were forbidden from entering the country until 2002. Within another half century or so since the referendum, Italy was subsumed into the European Union, where nationalism has become a bit of a dirty word in polite society.
The prominence of the nationalistic Vittoriano on the Capitoline thus seems somewhat out of proportion with its historical relevance in the grand scheme of Roman history. A modern glass lift takes you to a terrace with magnificent views of the Coliseum, and from its top, the visitor can also admire the many domes of Papal Rome including St Peter’s across the Tiber.
With the full sweep of Western political history presented topographically in the mind of the visitor, the Vittoriano comes across as a colossal altar to a temporary burst of a very confused Italian nationalism that lurched somewhat schizophrenically between clericalism, monarchism, republicanism and with the EU, supranationalism.
The contrast is even stronger next to the lucid, harmonious expression of the timeless humanism of the Renaissance. It is worth remembering humanism is centred on the human being, and its architecture is dimensioned accordingly to accomodate humans, not to overwhelm them.
The mortal remains of Vittorio Emanuele II are buried in the ancient Pantheon, in royal tombs which are still guarded by an honour guard wearing cloaks bearing the royal coat of arms of pre-1946 Italy. By good fortune I found myself at the Pantheon on a day the guards of the royal tombs were celebrating an event, and caught a glimpse of the man who would be crown prince. He approached the Pantheon to the jubilant strains of the Royal March trumpeted by uniformed bands playing the erstwhile national anthem of Italy.
The prominence and scale of the Vittoriano would be much more coherent if the Italians had kept their monarchy in some form.
The Compost Heap of History
After some time in Rome, as you explore the ruins and discover and understand more and more layers of its history, it begins to weigh on you. You feel the weight of Rome as “the compost heap of history”, as described by Sir Clark.
You know you are just another one of the countless humans to have trod down these same roads and piazzas that have been around for longer than mankind can remember. You are merely the topsoil of the compost heap, that too for a blink of an eye before being buried by the future. The weight of countless centuries and their achievements impose upon the individual not only his own inconsequentiality, but even that of his entire era.
The era your lifetime affords you a glimpse of is but a tiny fraction of time in this city’s history. That too shall pass, and it will not be remembered as the era that saw the rise of Rome, the pinnacle of its civilisation, its fall, its trough, or its rebirth in the Renaissance. It is not even the era of the rediscovery of the rebirth, which inspired fresh waves of art and creativity.
You know you are walking in the shadows of Goethe on his Roman trip, who walked in the shadows of Winckelmann, the father of art history who poetically described his rapture at ancient Greek sculptures in the 18th century and held them to be the highest ideal of art.
You are dwarfed even by Rilke dismissing the reverence of Roman antiquity and its hold on the imagination, complaining more than a hundred years ago, of Rome and:
“the lifeless and drear museum-like atmosphere it breathes, the abundance of fragments of the past (on which a tiny present nourishes itself), that have been fetched out of the ground and laboriously maintained, the unspeakable excess of esteem, nourished by academics and philologists with the help of run-of-the-mill tourists, given to all these disfigured and spoilt objects which after all are the vestiges of another age and of a life that is not our own and can never be.”
Knowing all this, is originality even possible? Or is human history just endless cycles of repetitions of the same impulses, emotions and ambitions, with only the dates and costumes changing?
Wondering how many of the masses understand the significance of what they are clicking away at with their phones, and confronting the shallowness of your knowledge even after this pilgrimage, it can be easier to sympathise with the eras that felt crushed by antiquity, than to be inspired by the Renaissance.
But then again, “the story of Western Civilisation is one of rebirths, so we should be encouraged.” And so we await the next rebirth, hunched over our phones.
After the cataclysms of the 20th century, which the Vittoriano reminds us of, it will likely be many more years before modern Europeans can rediscover the confidence let alone the creativity, and dare I say, spirituality, to launch the next Renaissance.
My pilgrimage remains incomplete. I know there is still much I don’t know about Rome, its history, and its art treasures, many of which I was unable to see this time, and many more whose existence I don’t yet know of, waiting to be discovered, and perhaps even more whose existence I will never know in this lifetime…
“The physical pain and the nobility of soul are distributed with equal strength over the entire body and are, as it were, held in balance with one another. Laocoon suffers, but he suffers like Sophocles’ Philoctetes; his pain touches our very souls, but we wish that we could bear misery like this great man.”
— Johann Joachim Winckelmann, Reflections on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture, 1755

In 2015, I celebrated my 60th birthday. I’m a sucker for celebrating milestone birthdays, so I decided it was time to take a Mediterranean cruise. I love cruising; I had already experienced cruises to Alaska and New England. And I knew from my previous trips to Italy, Germany, and Prague that I also loved Europe. So, I thought, why not meld the two with a European cruise.
I convinced my husband that I deserved to go on this cruise (which I did) and that we would start in Rome, and we’d also visit Athens and Istanbul, among other port towns and cities. I had previously visited Rome for about a week, but my husband had never been there, so we decided to spend a day in Rome before the cruise ship disembarked.
Well, the cruise ship doesn’t take off from Rome but from the port town of Civitavecchia, about an hour away from Rome. This trip represented a splurge, to say the least, so my husband decided we would take the train from Rome to Civitavecchia to save $100. When I told one of my well-traveled co-workers that we would take the train from Rome to Civitavecchia, he told me to make sure and watch out for gypsies.
I could tell he was somewhat serious, but at the mention of gypsies, my thoughts immediately turned to a Carmen-type character with hoop earrings, jet black hair, and flowing scarves and skirts…

“You packed what for Rome in March?”
That was the customs officer, eyeing my linen jumpsuit and flip-flops as if I’d just stepped off a cruise ship in the Arctic. To be fair, I thought March in Italy meant early spring. Blossom-scented breezes. Aperol spritzes under the sun. The Colosseum is adorned with charming gowns.
Instead, I stepped into what felt like a chilly Roman version of Seattle. The wind whipped through my bones. Locals wrapped themselves in puffer jackets and scarves. And there I was, dragging my tiny carry-on and an overinflated ego through cobblestone streets in socks that were basically social distancing from warmth.
Let me save you the frostbite. Here’s what I wish someone had told me before that first trip.
Italy in March sounds like a dream: off-season travel, fewer crowds, blooming landscapes, cheaper everything. And yes, that part is true.
But what your dreamy Pinterest boards don’t tell you? March in Italy is moody. One moment you find yourself soaking up the golden sunlight on the Spanish Steps, and the next, you find yourself sprinting through an unexpected downpour. The weather changes its mind more often…

Disclaimer: This is just a travel report. I won’t go into depth about statistics and politics.
As a French-born person. The rivalry between Italy and France has always been present in my mind.
Especially in 2006 when the Italians stole the Football World Cup (according to the French people at least).
And throughout education and media, a feeling of superiority is disseminated to the French nation:
Always look up to the Germans. Always look down on the Italians.
The Italians are also often called “Ritals”
Paris feels less safe. For instance, there are people at the airport trying to grab your suitcase and put it in their taxis so you feel obliged (threatened?) to use their services. I’ve lived this experience in Paris. But not in Rome.
The Roman transportation system and airports are less stressful. Speakers do not blast reminders every 30 seconds about pickpockets, C0vid rules, baggage security rules, etc. It is much more relaxing.

Mille viae ducunt homines per saecula Romam
(A thousand roads lead men forever to Rome)
– Proverb.
I have been reading and hearing much about population decline in the last months — except for Israel. India takes over from China as the largest population, since it is less urbanized. Homes are found empty in Japan for years now. Predictions are made for war and growth with a declining population. Schools are shut with no students. And there lies the prophecy of Universe 25.
For those of you who do not know, Universe 25 is the 25th iteration of a behavioural study on rodents. The premise was simples: you have some rats in a utopia designed to feed and house then to perfection, no luxury spared. Having reached 2200 mice, the population founds its way to decline in less than 2 years, and it eventually completely died out.
For those who observe the unprecedented prosperity humanity has reached, Universe 25 may seem like a Morgana’s prophecy: “he is your destiny, and he is your doom”. Thankfully, we are far more complex than mice, we are not confined in an experimental setting (unless you count the planet as confined, while we do not even know the whole of it yet) and we have a knack for developing — our not-so-utopia was not handed down to us by some ET.
I would submit we have far too many differences, and though we may share in a certain decline, the history of humanity is lined with ascent and descent: empires, tribes, families, armies and much more. And as I could not keep out of everything… this has everything to do with Ancient Rome. As a matter of fact, I continue to agree and expand on prof. Oliveira Martins’ quote (translated from Portuguese): “the history of the Roman Republic is the paradigm of all known histories”. Though I would say: the history of Ancient Roman is the known paradigm of all known histories. And in that I mean the empire, the republic, the kingdom, the city, the economy, the politics, the rivalries, and everything else.
And, in this too, Rome has already declined and mostly faded, buried under the sands of time; the city has suffered an unprecedented demographic collapse from the height of what could have been a hugely dense 1.5 million people metropolis[*] by the year 100 A.D. to a few tens of thousands by the start of the Middle Ages. Adding the Western Roman Empire’s downfall to external conquest and the Byzantine slow, thousand-year, decline: one can only say the answers also lie in Rome.
When we talk about the ancient city of Rome, it is difficult to know exactly what we are talking about. That is, the city changed so much from the kings to Odoacer that one would. Are we talking about the near-empty thatched huts before the Sabine women, are we talking about unprecedented marvels of marble and stone from all over the Mediterranean or are we talking about the mythical decadent figure bestowed unto us by artists and thinkers from the Renascence onward?
Well, we are talking about all of that, of course, but we cannot properly talk about all of that at the same time, lest we lose chronological sense.
Keeping that in mind, let us be orderly and start at the beginning. Rome would not look like a booming metropolis at the time of the kings. It had not sprawled over the seven hills, it had no Egyptian grain to distribute, no treasures of the mysterious East and none of the major marks (the Flavian Theatre, the Thermæ, the temples built by the greatest generals and so on). We are talking about a civilisation that is, in sooth, yet to be — though now we know it indeed was.
We may consider that the challenge posed to the Roman Kingdom and most of the republican times was there. A mission existed, be it to overcome Carthage, to attain general success or to rule the Sea. What I mean is: there is no place here for a weak, young society to ever act like a decadent empire. The opposite, in fact. There lies no path to power in imitating power. Brazil is an example of such a failure in our times: a country that looks up to “Scandinavian socialism”[†] and seeks to spend just like Sweden, while providing zero of the ambiance that gave way to Swedish prosperity — and we are not talking about an empire here. Needless to say, Brazil is not in the highway to prosperity, but threading the dangerous road to serfdom.
At any point, the fact is Rome stood far from the spoiling utopia of Universe 25 at this moment of its history.
After the fall of Carthage, we might say Rome has become the leading empire of its time, and of all time, we might add. That is, taking on the mantle of the cosmopolis, Rome is the universal empire that weaves the very legitimacy of the concept. And it did enjoy its time in the Sun, much like the USA after World War Two. Using the population of the actual city of Rome as a proxy, we must note that the population seems to have peaked by the end of the first century A.D., according to some estimations.
The precise movements of Roman prosperity are yet not detailed to be discussed, and are also not the main point of this essay, so here comes the question: what happened after that? Well, my readings indicate that the population fell just as quickly as it grew. It is important to observe that this was not a childless society. Romans died from plague and war; they moved back to the rural areas as Rome was politically and economically voided — and it would be possible that those who remained had less children, but who knows.
The point is: the urban population fell, and by the end of Antiquity, many estimates agree that it would not have even a hundred thousand people — and that it would continue to dim well into Medieval Times. We are talking here about a much more dangerous city, abandoned by the imperial structure, lacking a Senatorial class (or any such wealthy people who could turn anywhere they went into Monaco), partially abandoned and materially depreciating. This is no city of wonders, commerce, and opportunity. It is a hollow dream, voided by the decay and overextension of empire.
And for more than a thousand years, Rome would remain the seat of the papacy, de facto and de jure a Christian City (identified more by the Church than with the Byzantines over the Adriatic), mostly reduced to minor Italian squabbles, and depending on greater kingdoms to call upon its influence.
It is no mystery what the ancient Romans did: they fled to their farms. Large and small, senator or bum, the wandering search of safety, shelter and a life led the Romans to the countryside — and led properties to the hand of powerful men, who could defend the land/fiefs and the previous owners, now their servants or vassals. One might take note of the wording, but it is better to say it fully: feudalism had kicked down the door.
It is thus that some questions arise:
i. What was happening to population and fertility when feudalism began?
ii. Did moving away from Rome make less babies or more?
iii. How relevant was the barbarian influx?
iv. How and why did things change again?
One might observe that these are not trivial questions. To answer them accurately would require precise data from more than a thousand years ago, and we do not have that. In many ways, that may be a problem since the absence of this information makes way for all sort of fantasy storytelling, but let us propose some thoughts:
It is likely that fertility fell by the end of Antiquity, as that trend is observed for general times of crises, but it is unclear if that had any meaningful role to play in the social or economic setting. We know, as an example, that individual wealth grew at the time of the Black Death, since it led to concentration of inheritance and the scarcity of labour. It would be interesting to see how that would have worked out a thousand years prior. It is also not clear if there was a difference in urban and rural fertility, as there exists nowadays.
[*] 1.5 million people is the highest number found during my research on the topic, but I am not subscribing to that number, just using it as a reference for the scale of the collapse.
[†] It is unfortunately the case for Brazilian politics, that the Marxist/socialist left (allied to Maduro, Cuba, Ortega, …) conflates the Scandinavian political and economic setting with “socialism that works”, at the same time using the ludicrous claim that the USSR, Cambodia, and other such bloodthirsty regimes were not “real socialism” (at best, there are times when we can hear people defending gulags or saying they never existed in the first place). We should observe that such claims have been publicly refuted not only by simple facts, but also by Scandinavian leaders, but referring more commonly to claims made by American politicians: <https://www.vox.com/2015/10/31/9650030/denmark-prime-minister-bernie-sanders>
P.S.: the above is an informal essay, please do not consider it conclusive, fully researched or based.

“All roads lead to Rome” — Romans have built one of the most sophisticated road networks, and all of them ended in the heart of the Empire — the City of Rome. I’ve cheated and took a plane, but eventually made it to one of the most interesting cities in the world.
“All roads lead to Rome” — you’ve heard this expression before. Maybe in the history class, maybe in the tourist guide. It comes from Roman Empire times. Back then, they built one of the most sophisticated road networks, and all of the roads led to the heart of the Empire — the City of Rome. I’ve cheated and took a plane, but eventually made it to one of the most interesting cities in the world.
There are two main reasons why you want to visit Rome: history and food. Guilty as charged, I have a soft spot in my heart for both of them. Growing up I have read numerous books on the history of Ancient Rome and have always been drawn to it. Romans made a huge contribution to our everyday lives: their political, economic, cultural and social norms had set the precedence for quite a lot of ways in which our modern society works. Food is amazing and available pretty much everywhere.
Also moving forward I will start to feature some music from the country I’ve visited to set your mood while you are reading the blog. The first are italo disco heroes Marvin & Guy.
When you start planning your trip, keep in mind that you will be walking a lot. Most attractions and sights are fairly close to each other and easily accessible by foot. Although Rome has public transportation and taxis/ridesharing services, I would recommend staying in central areas and just walk around. There is nothing like getting lost in the small ancient cobblestone streets of Rome… well, as long as you have comfortable shoes ;)
With that in mind I’ve ended up choosing the hotel in the Prati neighborhood, which is located halfway between the Vatican and Historic Center. I didn’t want to be in the midst of touristy areas but still appreciated an easy access to all sights. It worked out perfectly. I would also recommend Trastevere for good nightlife. Otherwise, most areas in Historic Center will provide you with numerous accommodation options. The only exception is the area around Termini — city’s main train and bus station, it seems to have a bad reputation.
Rome has 2 international airports but you most likely will arrive at Fiumicino Airport (FCO). It is the largest airport in Rome and Italy. Technically its official name is Aeroporto Leonardo da Vinci. From there you can take an express train or bus to Termini station, the ride will take you about 30–40 mins. I’ve chosen to take a bus because it had a stop near Vatican about 5 mins away from my hotel. I was advised against taking a taxi from the airport since they tend to overcharge tourists regardless of the mandated fixed fee. Unfortunately, you can’t order Uber from airport. In general Uber allowed in the city but only for premium cars/vans. If you want a regular UberX/Lyft experience, download MyTaxi app.
Start your trip from Colosseum. It is an amphitheater built in Ancient Rome times, which used to hold 50,000 spectators. Throughout times it was modernized, rebuilt and upgraded, all the while remaining a world-famous landmark. It hosted gladiator fights, animal hunts, mock sea battles, and executions. Colosseum is the symbol of Imperial Rome and one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.
Because of its popularity, it’s a major tourist trap. If walking around as a part of the crowd where everybody is trying to take a picture of every stone is not your thing, play smart. Rule #1: buy the ticket in advance here, the same ticket will get you to the Colosseum, Forum and Palatine Hill — all while avoiding the ticket line. Rule#2: get there super early and ideally on the workday, drink espresso in the morning (we’ll come back to that) and head over right away. You goal is to be done with all of this by early afternoon and switch to drinking Aperol Spritz somewhere.
Roman Forum is the plaza in the center of Rome next to Colosseum and Palatine Hill. Back in the days it was a center of Roman life, and now surrounded by the ruins of the several ancient government buildings. But even ruins give you an idea of the majestic importance and the spirit of the place.
Palatine Hill is one of the oldest parts of the city and the original location of imperial palaces. You can walk around the territory and learn about ancient buildings. Now remember my previous point of getting there earlier. Well, we didn’t. For some reason we’ve decided to grab lunch after Colosseum and do the rest after. Rookie mistake. Don’t be like us. That Aperol Spritz not going to drink itself.
Actually, let’s talk about Aperol, Campari and all other good stuff. Italians have a strong culture of aperitifs — drinks served before the meal. Aperol is an orange liquor, and Campari is a blood orange liqueur. Both are very popular aperitifs and bases for popular aperitif cocktails: Aperol Spritz (Aperol+Prosecco+club soda) and Americano (Campari+sweet vermouth+club soda) respectively. Needless to say, there’s nothing better than sipping one (or more) of them on a warm sunny day while enjoying the view after some touristy activities. Mark my words. You’re welcome.
Finish the walk at Piazza Venezia — the home of Vittorio Emanuele II Monument. It is a monument built in honor of the first king of unified Italy in 1919. It is one of the most amazing Roman buildings and just a colossal piece of architecture, which simply hypnotizes you. That’s probably one of the reasons Mussolini used it as a place for the military parades and public speeches.
It is the second day and you’re a bit tired from walking yesterday (or drinking last night), so you need a little pick me up. Now let’s pause here for a second. Coffee is somewhat a religion in Italy, and they take it seriously. There are also some rules, which you might consider even weird, but it’s their country and their rules. Rule #1: cappuccino (and other milk espresso-based drinks) or espressos with some pastry (croissant) in the mornings, only espressos in the afternoons. Rule #2: you order coffee at the bar and drink it quickly while standing. There is also the specific way to order it: you pay first, then take your receipt to the barista, who then will make it for you. Now you’re not the first foreigner who visited Italy, and most likely you will be near the major touristy area. So, nobody will really care, if you sit down in the afternoon with a cup of latte. But it’s generally a good idea to be aware of the local customs, so you don’t look like a complete idiot in their eyes.
Once you’re energized and ready to do, start from Piazza Navona. It a famous square of three fountains: Fontana del Moro, Fountain of Neptune and Fountain of Four Rivers. You would probably recognize them from various movies or famous photos.
Your next stop is The Pantheon. It’s a former Roman temple turned to church. It’s one of the best preserved Ancient Roman buildings because of its extensive use over the years. Interesting fact: its ceiling is done in the form of a dome, and till this day its world’s largest unreinforced concrete dome, and of course there are rumors of gods helping out there.
The Trevi Fountain is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and another world-famous piece of architecture. Rumor has it, you have to drink a glass of water out of it in order to come back to Rome. Today you’ll have to put some work in to get to it through the crowd of tourists. If you do so, there’s a pretty good chance that you’ll come back.
The Spanish Steps is another iconic sight, which was originally built to connect Spanish embassy with the church on top of the hill. By then you are probably a little tired and want to sit down, relax and eat gelato. Steps sound like a perfect place to do it. Wrong. The majority of the people sitting on the steps are tourists. Italians are not huge fans of sitting on the historical monument. Recently they’ve passed a law that allows police to give out tickets up to 400 euros to ppl sitting there. It might be a very expensive gelato after all. If you’re still full of energy you can walk up to Villa Borghese Gardens, which is a public park on top of the hill.
Vatican is an independent city-state within Rome borders. It’s the smallest sovereign state in the world by area and population, and primarily exists under the governance of the Catholic Church. Again, follow the rule: sightseeing in the morning, relaxing in the afternoon. Beat the crowds by arriving earlier. Vatican’s main sights are St. Peter’s Basilica, the Sistine Chapel and Vatican Museums.
St. Peter’s Basilica is the largest church in the world and one of the holiest Catholic shrines. The entrance is free, but if you want to go up to its top and enjoy the amazing view, you’ll have to join the separate dome line and pay the fee. The Sistine Chapel is the official residence of Pope in Vatican City. The Vatican Museums are Christian art museums, which display works collected by popes over the years.
From Vatican walk to Castel Sant’Angelo. It’s cylindrical building on the right bank of the Tiber. It was originally built as a mausoleum and later used as a fortress or castle. Inside there’s a museum and you can also go to its roof and grab a bite while enjoying the view.
While doing all of the discussed sightseeing, you should not forget the second reason why you are in Rome: food. You will see it everywhere. The rule of thumb: if you see a lot of tourist crowds, do not buy food there. Walk a couple of blocks, look where locals eat. Also embrace carbs, carbs, carbs.
Several dishes you should absolutely try in Rome:
Generally, I would recommend to explore Trastevere neighborhood, which is famous for its nightlife: restaurants and bars.
Ciao!

If you only have a few days in Rome, as I did, it’s important to see as much history and culture as possible. In our last post, we showed you our ideal day in the heart of Rome, Piazza Novona — the best espresso (according to Romans) , gelato, markets, and the Pantheon. In bite-size pieces, here’s our version of the best things to do in Rome in 48 hours.
I. Piazza della Repubblica: Piazza della Repubblica is a beautiful semi-circullar piazza with the Fountain of the Naiads in the center, and the Basilica of St. Mary of the Angels and Martyrs across from the fountain. I encourage you to look inside the Basilica, inside is a beautiful bronze meridian solar line, designed by Francesco Bianchini, with marble depictions of the zodiacs.
II. The Colosseum — because no trip to Roma is complete without visiting the Colosseum, the icon of Imperial Rome. Right next door to the Colosseum is the Roman Forum, the heart of ancient Rome. Both ruins are must see when visiting Rome, and you can purchase the Roma Pass, which gives free entry to both the Forum and the Colosseum.
III. The Spanish Steps (or the walk to the Spanish Steps): The Spanish Steps is a monumental set of 135 steps, made famous by the 1953 classic Roman Holiday, with Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck. The base of the steps can be overcrowded with tourists, so I suggest arriving north of the steps by Via Sistina and taking the time to visit the shops along the way, and admire the charming architecture of the streets of Rome.
IV. Villa Borghese: Villa Borghese is an extensive garden that was built in 1605 by Cardinal Borghese as a party villa. It has many villas built as summer residences for Popes and nobles, but is now most visited for the Galleria Borghese, which has sculptures by Bernini, and paintings by Raphael and Caravaggio. Buy tickets in advance because this is a popular museum, and aside from the Vatican, contains some of the best works in Rome. If you don’t make it to the museum, or want to spend an extra hour or so exploring the park, there is much to see, such as the Sienna Square, National Gallery of Modern Art, or the Temple of Aesculapius. My favorite part of the park was the view from the Villa Medici. which offers stunning panoramic views of Rome (above).
V. Vatican City: The Vatican can be made a half-day trip or a whole day excursion. There is so much art in the Vatican Museums, and because of the amount of tourists, I recommend allotting quite a few hours to see all the art the Vatican has to offer. There are four Sculpture Museums, a Painting Collection, a museum of Modern Religious Art, and a historical museum and art gallery. The Vatican’s extensive art collection started over 500 years ago with the purchase of Laocoon and his Sons, a marble sculpture found in a vineyard near the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome. The Sistine Chapel cannot be missed, I could spend hours looking up at the masterpiece of a ceiling, Michelangelo’s greatest work. The heart of the Vatican is St. Peter’s Basilica, one of the world’s largest churches, and the most renowned work of Renaissance architecture. Words cannot even describe the magnificence of St. Peter’s Basilica, and you must see Michelangelo’s Pieta located inside the Basilica.

When I was a kid I watched a movie called “Roman Holiday”. The magnificent and enchanting scenery shown in the film evoked my longing for Rome.
Years later, I had the opportunity to visit the “Eternal City” (with more than 2500 years of history). It was 2003, and my husband and I decided to take a week-long vacation to Rome.
As with my other travel stories, here I will continue to talk about some of the little things I observed and experienced in Rome.
1. The airport bus couldn’t open its door and a ‘free’ subway ride
One afternoon in March, we took off from Düsseldorf, Germany, with our infant son, and arrived at Rome’s Fiumicino airport about two hours later.
March is the best season in Rome, the weather is neither cold nor hot. We came from still chilly Germany to warm Rome and felt comfortable. But soon we were overwhelmed by what happened next.
After waiting at the airport for a long time, the bus to the city finally arrived. Before we could react, the crowd swarmed and filled the bus in an instant.
Oddly, the middle door of the bus wouldn’t open, so our pram had to squeeze in through the narrow front door.

When I travel, I like to seek out authentic local experiences. This time someone heard my prayers and decided to give me one of the most classic local southern European experiences ever on my first day — a public transportation strike. So I walked everywhere.
First impressions:The area around the train station was pretty gritty, there was graffiti on every vertical surface, litter all over the ground, and…sketchy people standing around. But this is pretty standard around big train stations everywhere in the world, Paris North Station is also similar, but Rome definitely outperforms Paris in terms of grittiness. Unlike the perfectly manicured buildings in Paris, Rome feels more “wild” and unrestrained.
Roman traffic deepened such an impression. Walking on a large boulevard, I reached a roundabout where many large roads met. In the middle of the road, there was a small police stop, with two middle-aged Italian policewomen directing traffic. They were doing a good job, but they were a little…unpredictable. Literally in the middle of a green light with cars pouring onto the intersection, one of them strolled confidently into the middle of the road, and held out her hand firmly to stop traffic. The cars stopped. They were not in straight lines. Some cars backed out of the intersection. Everything was still for a moment. And then the chaos reignited. I had no idea what was going on, and to be honest I was a little bemused, but I calmly crossed the street and kept walking. Traffic in Rome is quite a comedy. Not all major intersections have traffic lights or crosswalks, but that doesn’t stop people from darting across busy traffic; and even when there are traffic lights, that doesn’t stop cars and motorbikes from sneaking across. On paper, this sounds like Paris, but I assure you it’s different. Parisian drivers don’t open the windows to shout expressively at you with both hands gesturing wildly. Rome has a more comical disorganization, it’s like a Mr. Bean who knows what he’s doing. It’s hard to explain.
“Parla inglese?” It’s been a while since I’ve been in a country where I don’t speak the local language, and I’d forgotten how frustrating but also how amusing that can be. I’d pre-booked entrance tickets to the Coliseum, Forum, and Palantine Hill to avoid waiting in long lines. I’d read the fare conditions closely, and realized that I could get in for free with my Tufts in Paris “student of Art History” ID. Since mine was a discounted ticket, I had to go to the ticket office to verify my status before going in.
At the ticket office : (original conversation, imagine strong iTaLiAn accent) - Ticket lady: You reserved a free ticket, you need pay 12 euros for the adult ticket.- Me: (confused because I’d also reserved an audio guide for 7.5 euros, but in the moment I forgot what the 7.5 euros was for, and also forgot why I got a “free” ticket) I thought I paid 7.5 euros for a ticket, why are you saying it’s free?- Ticket lady: That is for the audio guide. For the entrance fee, you need to pay 12 euros because you are not an EU citizen. You need an ID or passport.- Me : (in my mind — how do you know I’m not an EU citizen??? and then I remembered why I got discounted tickets and started taking out my Tufts in Paris Art History ID) I’m a student — - Ticket lady: (interrupting) No student ticket, only adult 12 euros.- Me: But I study art history.- Ticket lady: Architecture?- Me: No, art history.- Ticket lady: Not architecture?- Me: No, art history!- Ticket lady: Ohhh ok, ~art history~ I see, sorry but only students of architecture and history of art can get free tickets.- Me: (ready to faint — art history and history of art are the same thing!)I didn’t want to argue with her anymore so I just pressed my ID against the glass.- Ticket lady: (sees my ID that says “l’histoire de l’art”) Oh ok! Then that’s good!
Good thing I insisted and didn’t cave in to paying 12 euros, otherwise I’d have lost many gelatos and that would be very sad :(
After an afternoon, I have the impression that Rome is a little less organized and less glamorous than Paris, but with more character and personality. It’s like Paris is an elegant, uptight lady, whereas Rome is a carefree singing guitarist with tattered clothes. But this is just day 1, maybe my impressions will change after 5 days! :)

Before I begin, I would like you to know how why I am sharing this information with you, since each author has their purpose and I am sure that you are curious about mine. Why should you believe me, an American girl still in high school? For starters, I am not tied to any organization and I am not trying to sell you anything. I am not only writing this to make your trip planning easier, but I am also writing this for myself. I have also added my own personal experience to guide you. I hope that while recording my own memories, I can aid you in planning your trip to Rome so you can have the best experience.
Most people visit Rome in the summer months when the blazing sun illuminates the historical center. My family (of four) decided to avoid the crowds and fly to the city in late December. I was tasked with the most time-consuming but also the most important job: creating the itinerary. My job consisted of booking reservations for the famed Colosseum and Vatican Museums, finding small gelato shops and fancy restaurants, and locating more authentic Italian respites.
The biggest downside was that there wasn’t much information about what Rome was like in the winter so we didn’t know what clothes to pack. According to the weather predictors, the sun set around 5:45 pm which was very early. Also, the temperature ranged from 35°F to 60°F. We weren’t sure about how to dress; should we wear t-shirts? Coats? We honestly had to improvise, so we packed a bit of everything.
Now, when I was trying to plan the trip out, I did not have such a wealth of information in one place. Even more annoying, many of the websites I found were advertising tickets much more expensive than the actual ones. I spent many hours on TripAdvisor, browsing through the many forums. It was difficult to find truly unbiased information. In total, I spent many hours on hundreds of websites trying to figure out how to best visit Rome and what to know about customs in Italy. Of course, there wasn’t information about everything, so we ended up learning a lot of lessons from our unexpected encounters.
I also had a tough time with scheduling. While researching, I discovered that Italy was a lot different compared to the suburbs where I reside. It takes about an hour to walk from one end to the other. This posed a problem for me while I was planning; I wasn’t really used to city life, so I didn’t have a good sense of how long it would take to walk certain distances. I also had no ideas as to how long we would spend at each site. Would we spined at the Spanish Steps? Five minutes? One hour? What about the Pantheon? Maybe we would have extra time. Maybe we would be rushing everywhere. We really just had to wait and see. Now I know you’re curious to see how the trip turned out.
Overall, Rome was a great experience for me. I got to see the historical sites outside of textbooks and class and I was taken back by how huge everything is. You really won’t be able to appreciate the genius of the ancient Romans and the Renaissance artists until you get to observe the great works with your own eyes. Since we visited in December, we got to enjoy the Christmas lights and trees set up all across the city. And of course, the pasta, pizza, and gelato were all very delicious. There was a lot of variety at restaurants and cafes so I got to try things that were very atypical of my American lifestyle (Nutella pizza or fried zucchini flowers).
Now onto the specifics (click here to see a shortened version):
Here’s what I would advise: pack layers. We didn’t realize that most of the time we would be out when it was cold, so we didn’t pack very well. Only my mom did, so I had to borrow some of her clothes. It is really cold in the morning up to about 10 am and after sunset around 6 pm. Here’s what kept me warm:
This guide should have covered extensively all the little things you know about visiting Rome. Should you have any more questions, do let me know. Otherwise, I do hope this helped and safe travels!

Dramatic titles for me are an art form and today we are about to talk about something with no relation to any of the cities mentioned above but points to critical moments in all. Abstract titles are my way of art and ironically they a mosaics that my mind paints.
Rome was not built in a day; this a saying that has been repeated for a long time, and will also be passed to generations as long as humanity remains. It is true, Rome as an empire has been around Before Christ and After Christ hence, it is obvious that it was not a day’s job. I think it is more important to take the principles of Roman Construction and apply them in our lives.
The senior Pastor at Life Church said something in a sermon I watched, He said “When we are born we look like our Parents, when we die we look like our choices ”. That word struck me and I who enjoy a largely sedentary lifestyle imposed on me by the nature of my career went for a much-needed walk. I live in Ajah (an area in Lagos) and I have lived here for a while now (except when I was in Uni), I have seen development occur with time and how places that would have you scared now look like a jewel.
However it was not always so, I recalled and remembered what it used to be like when I walked towards a now abandoned house, an abandoned site, and a poorly maintained sand-filled road. When I began to see these buildings and roads, got the burden to paint them with words as it cuts across various niches.
Knowledge is the most pleasant and annoying thing to have, it is a double edge sword. Ardan Labs a software company that has a training arm has a saying, “If you think it’s expensive to hire a professional, just wait until you hire an amateur” and it is true about learning, “If you think it’s expensive to train to be a professional, try ignorance”. Like every good Lawyer, I will present facts that could be misconstrued but I hope I paint pictures that will live an impression on you.
Pompei is/was a city that existed in Italy under the Roman empire that got buried under ash from an Erupted volcano called Mount Vesuvius. They thrived as a City till a threat possibly called everyone who lived in that city.
Knowledge as a double edge sword had me asking how did people come to settle around an Active Volcano. Did they have no Geophysicist, no Geologist in ancient Rome that could inform people of the threat to life? Ignorance which was not an active choice of the people of Pompeii levelled and buried an entire city.
Atlantis is presented as a lost city buried somewhere in the ocean, although scientific inquiry has presented facts that Plato’s work which mentioned Atalantis in his work Timaeus and Critias was not a total representation of life but an allegory to drive home a point. As such science concludes that Atlantis never existed. Well, I am not debating science but Intend to accept for the basis of this at Atlantis did exist.
A beautiful city that got buried as a result of earthquakes, again if Atlantis really did exist why did its people decide to settle on an Island? If they had the foresight of the future would they have settled there? I would argue and present an engineer's answer “It depends”, however, the law of averages agrees that if they settled elsewhere and the earthquake happens again the island may sink or it would not, depending on its averages (in this case the intensity of the quake).
These two cities albeit one being a farce and the other did exist, are demonstrations of how knowledge gaps are our undoing. I looked at buildings that were the houses that tickled my need to be rich and a few of them looked like the have sunk. I remember coming to Dad’s house while it was constructed and its foundation was so high. My dad imagine the height of the road ( in the future ) which I felt was nearly insane. Looking at houses around that looked like they had sank and will still sink I began to understand that an intricate part of knowledge and building (not actual buildings) with it is the ability to preempt actions, develop more knowledge and respond accordingly. Today the height of the road is at least a level higher than my Dad anticipated. There are 5 new buildings around my Dad’s house and they seem taller because of the new ground level the foundation was laid, luckily for my Folks their house did not sink or sink as much, but this ability to preempt the future or an unforeseen circumstance struck me as a key to building.
Recently I switched my work codebase from an in-route logic-dependent application to a repository pattern which was initializing access to the Database (DB) in the Repositories, that was an excellent design for me at the time, the way the DB was accessed was flawless and I felt nothing could go wrong.
There has been a sprint-like approach my team had imbibed to produce the product that had been blueprinted (designed). In this fire brigade approach, I discovered that the access to the DB was a poor decision, my ignorance of this was glaring and staring me down and I had to come up with a solution. I spent 16 hours working across two days to come up with a solution that resolves the DB via the Framework’s method. I am sure it feels like I have lost you, apologies. Enough of Tech detailed talk layered with backend remarks. My ignorance meant that if this product went live based on my decision and knowledge at the time there was going to be an epic fail.
Luckily for me, I saved the day by experimenting and drawing fact-based solutions from a source of truth (FastAPI’s documentation), my teammates attested to an uptick in performance across my system. There is a word for if that situation above got to production and I have to manage the such situation and resolve it. It is called Technical debt. The lack of knowledge with regards to something intricate means that we would not deliver at the optimal mark in that regard.
A lot is happening across the world, the more we look the more we see that no one really has it all figured out, communities, countries, sports teams, people and automated processes. Knowledge is not a destination it is a continuous place. Knowledge is the refiner's fire, through its acquisition we realize how flawed our previous implementations are.
We do this by becoming like Rome.
Rome seems to be a wonder of the world, because, at some point in our lives, we hear Rome was not built in a day to persuade us to do the work. The idea however is to communicate to us the Kaizenic nature of Rome’s Architecture. There are Ancient structures that are still up today, such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and the Roman amphitheatre among a few which I know.
These structures are borne out of a place of improvement, the first structure architects would design would give them the cringe if they look at it after years of practice and work, this is why tech solutions are versioned, and this is why we have a Corolla 1998 and 2023 version. It is the Kaizenic nature of constant improvement, this motion is borne out of a place of constant reflection and a zest for the better.
This is why Veterans in any field are better than young blood, this is why the best coaches are people who actively did what they are coaching about (Albeit not at the grandest of stages).
The Roman buildings and the empire did not take over the whole world in one day, it was a gradual continuous action that became the empire. Some battles, some wars, some years of peace. History’s recounts are always fast and opaquely divulging to the perspective of time and timing. A good example as we ride out on the last strokes of this art, are football players.
A lot of these players dedicate their lives to this sport, childhood, teenage, and even their youth, why will Haland not be a deadly striker? Why will he also not lose a penalty, how come he could he can easily move on.
Time is an important perspective to everything including knowledge, I hated balancing chemical equations in secondary school but I loved it in the early years of Uni.
The most important thing these buildings have thought me is if we are not dead yet then we can become better, your next project should be better than the previous one, that is the only way to show growth and become Rome.
When we are born we are like our parents, but in death, we are our choices. I live you with a wise word on life, we will always have regrets in life, these are an opportunity cost of opportunities forgone. The rule is to remember regret is a feature of life, not a Bug.
Till next time.

From Bari I headed across Italy to Pompeii and an overnight stop in the Bay of Naples.
There’s not much that can be said — at least, not much that’s profound — about Pompeii that hasn’t been said, better, a dozen times before.
It’s been a world-famous tourist destination for literally centuries — an unmissable stop on the original Grand Tours.
So my main observations are pretty unoriginal.
My first: it’s big — really big. I trudged around for five hours and didn’t see it all.
As is always the case in places like this, the choking crowds of tourists quickly thinned out, observing the inverse square law of laziness.
My other unoriginal observation is that it’s amazingly well preserved. It’s not in obviously worse nick than the 30-year-old ruins we had seen in Mostar a few weeks earlier.
In a neat parallel to the low-value service industry focus of today’s Pompeii — surrounded by snack bars, restaurants and hotels — the ancient ruins of Pompeii show that not that much was different two millennia ago.
The economy of Roman Pompeii revolved, clearly, around having a good time.
Leisure centres — sorry, Roman baths. Sports centres — sorry, amphitheatres. Takeaways — sorry, thermopolia. Really, the tourist industry of southern Italy hasn’t changed that much in two millennia. The ancient ruined versions don’t even look that different from their modern counterparts.
After an overnight stop in Torre del Greco — in a charming farm with half-arsed service and unannounced restaurant closure — the car, which had been complaining of some unspecified lurgy since Albania (through the medium of beeps and a flashing orange spanner icon), finally decided that it was oil that it wanted.
The car had been bonked pretty hard on the underside in the rock-strewn ploughed field that passed for a car park at Bogove waterfall near Berat a few days earlier. Had I punctured the oil pan?
To make matters worse, I’d told a local tweenager trying to shake me down for a couple of lek to ‘watch my car’ to get lost. Had he sabotaged the car in revenge?
Was the car slowly bleeding out? Was it leaving a puddle of motor oil at every stop?
Was the motor, pistons unlubricated, grinding itself down into iron filings with every mile driven?
Being prone to anxiety, this is not the sort of thing I am particularly good at remaining relaxed about.
The anxiety was not improved by noticing liquid dripping from the underside of the car while waiting outside the gates of the guest house (the manager taking his sweet time — more than half an hour — to actually come and let me in).
Leaving a tarpaulin under the car overnight calmed nerves somewhat when it emerged the next morning without any oil stains at all. The dripping was… water from having cleaned the windscreen.
And, using a dipstick for the first time since my driving test, I concluded the oil level in the engine was just about tolerable — admittedly when parked on a slope.
My mind put slightly, if not entirely, at ease, I powered north towards Rome, where, after some not-entirely-enjoyable traffic, and quite possibly some low traffic neighbourhood-related traffic infractions, I parked the car underground for a few days.
I’ve been asked a ton of times why I can speak Italian. The answer I usually give — my dad’s a retired Italian literature professor and I grew up hearing it — isn’t really true, or at least, it’s far from a full explanation.
It’s not like hearing grown men talking about Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio is a great draw for a kid.
And I hardly ever went to Italy in childhood either — aside from two trips to Veneto, summer holidays were always in France.
It’s when I was a student that I became obsessed with Italy.
Over a couple of summer trips, I came to love all the ways in which it’s the best country in the world by a country mile. Nowhere else packs in as much good food, history, architecture and culture.
I came to love, too, all the other ways in which Italy powers through its manifest dysfunctions, shaking off flaws that would condemn lesser countries to failure and obscurity. I even enjoy — no, enjoy isn’t quite the right word, am entertained by — Italian politics.
And so, at a loose end the summer after graduating, having failed to line up a job (worse was to come when I lined up one I hated), I signed up for introductory Italian classes.
My ear trained by hearing the tedious Dante talk, my interest piqued by summer trips, and with the headstart that comes from French grammar and vocabulary, I found Italian ridiculously easy to learn.
After a couple of terms and fairly minimal effort, I was speaking far better Italian than I ever did German, despite six years’ hard slog through school.
I’ve been to Italy most years ever since.
Which makes it all the more odd that this was actualy my first trip to Rome.
It didn’t disappoint.
Not just because St Peter’s is every bit as extraordinary as its reputation. It feels corny to say, but it’s a genuinely awe-inspiring and — whisper it — spiritual place.
Not just because the ancient sites — the Forum, the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo — are so impressive.
Not even because the Pantheon is even more astonishing than I expected, and the architectural highlight of the entire trip.
In addition to that, it’s also everything I usually like about Italy — from the great food, to the nice atmosphere, to the walkable cityscape.
It’s also got the distinctive typography on its shop signs that you see everywhere in Italy and nowhere outside it.
(It’s also while in Rome that I got the good news about a funding bid I’d written just before heading off. This prompted an ill-advised but enjoyable number of Campari spritzes on a very nice café terrace in Trastevere, and a well-earned headache the next morning.)
After resting the ailing car for a few days, I made a detour to a Peugeot garage in the suburbs for the oil it was demanding, then headed north.

New theories about a mystery hundreds of years old and a secret known to few Romans that was not meant to be revealed
It was 8 a.C. when the famous poet Ovid fell out of favor with the Emperor Augustus, who exiled him, without the confiscation of his goods, to Tomis (now Costance), a small port on the Black Sea.
But what was the cause of this great punishment for such a famous and important character for Rome?
Let’s try to give an answer to this question, taking into account the new theories.
Publio Ovidio Nasone was one of the most important Roman poets, one of the main exponents of Latin literature and, above all, of the elegiac poetry.
- Elegiac Poetry: lyrical composition united by specific metric form and by arguments that were opposed to the epic with a subjective and autobiographical setting, interpreted as a lament.
Ovid was the author of many works and his fame was as great during his lifetime as afterwards: his style and his themes were taken up by Dante, Petrarca, Shakespeare and many other.
His most famous work is “The Metamorphoses” whose the best known story is Apollo and Daphne’s myth.
So, what was the reason for his RELEGATIO (exile)? It still is a mystery today as the clues we have come almost exclusively from Ovid himself: what we know for sure is that the poet was exiled by the Emperor Augustus, but his successor, the Emperor Tiberius, maintained the punishment.
The fame of Ovid, as mentioned, during his life was very great and therefore the reason behind his exile must have been very serious.
Let’s see here what his “error” may have it been, according to the scholars, ‘till recent times.
- An illecit relationship with Giulia Maggiore, the daughter of the Emperor Augustus, of which he sang in the “Amores”, under the pseudonym of “Corinna”
- Perhaps he favored the relationship between Giulia Minore, granddaughter of Augustus and daughter of Giulia Maggiore, and Senator Decimo Giunio Silanus, causing them to commit the crime of adultery
- He discovered illecit dealings of Emperor Augustus at his court
- He snooped about the private conducts of Livia Drusilla, wife of Augustus
- He partecipated in a conspiracy against Tiberius
It was precisely in the year of the exile that Ovid had achieved his maximus success thanks to “The Metamorphoses”, his masterpiece, in which he recounts the transformation of the protagonists into plants, animals or objects.
Ovid was considered a libertine and wasn’t well seen by the Augustan political side, very traditionalist and conservative, because he used to criticized the two fundamental pillars of the Roman society: Religion and Family.
But it was not this that caused the exile, but something that as a punishment had the “capital punishment” which, however, Emperor Augustus commuted into exile (as Ovid himself tells us).
But it really was one of the aforementioned actions that condemned Ovid? What about the “carmina”?
As mentioned before, the reason we have listed ahve been proposed by scholars until recently, almost forgetting the “carmina” implied and the fact that this could be connected to the “error” and not be a separate thing.
At the time of his exile, Ovid was writing the “Fasti”, an epic poem aimed at revisiting Roman festivals and rites: there would have been 12 books, one for each month of the year.
Halfway through the work, the order for the RELEGATIO arrived and the work was interrupted, nver to be resumed again.
- A clue -
At the beginning of the fifth book, where the poet researches the etymological origins of the name of the month of May and at a certain point, Ovid has the Muse Calliope (the poetry’s muse) tell the backgrounds of Rome’s foundation and she speaks of the constellation of the Pleiades.
In Latin literature, the importance that Ovid gave to this constellation when speaking about Rome’s origin is unusual: no one before him had mentioned neither Maia nor teh Pleiades in this context.
Certainly Ovid would never have allowed himself to invent something extraneous to the tradition regarding the birth of Rome (neither did the non-romans writers or Rome’s enemies).
- Was, therefore, a forbidden subject that Ovid wrote about? -
We must now take a step back and tell talk about an event that took place about 100 years earlie: the story of Quinto Valerio Sorano who was senteced to death for revealing the secret name of Rome.
Servius and Plutarch too wrote of the sacrilege commited by Soranus, a tribune of the plebs, poet and grammarian of vast erudition, dear friend of Cicero, whose sentence was death by crucifixion.
A certain reason, that we know for sure, for which the Romans kept the real name of the Urbe (other latin name for Rome) hidden and secret is the EVOCATIO (evocation), a rite for which the patron god of a city was invoked, pronouncing its name, in front of its walls during a siege: knowing the name of the god was the equivalent to seizing the essence of the city and subduing it.
- The Pleiades -
The Pleiades are a cluster of stars located in the constellation of Taurus, 440 light years away from the Earth and includes about 3000 stars, but the eye can see only 6 to 12 of them.
These stars are mentioned by many ancient peoples and it is considered that they thought there were 7 of them. They are found depicted in the Nebra Disc, the oldest surviving depiction of the night sky, dating back to 1600 b.C. .
Also according to the Greeks, the Pleiades were 7: Daughters of Atlas and Pleirone (daughter of Tetis and Ocean) their names were “Alcione and Merope, Celeno and Taigete, Elettra and Sterope, together with the most holy Maia”. (Cicero, “Aratea”)
At this point a consideration needs to be made.
In the ancient world what was sacred on earth was often a reflection of what was in the sky: for example, Mount Taigete (Sparta) took its name from the Pleiade mother of Sparta’s “founder”, Lacedaemon.
Here, as the Roman encyclopedist Marcus Terentium Varro: “Where now stands Roma, there was once the Septimountius, so called for the number of mountains that the city later included within its walls.”
We know that the Septimountius does not correspond to the Seven Hills of Rome, but the concept of the Seven Hills could itself be the result of a schematization that reduced the number of the hills of the territory that extends on the left bank of the Tiber.
This semplification would seem pointless, but perhaps the aim was to make the hills correspond to the Seven Pleiades; in fact, even the arrangement of the hills seems to respect that of the “seven stars pleiades”.
The Palatine Mount, on which Romulus traced the furrow of the Urbe, corresponds to “the most holy Maia”.
In the story of the foundation, we find another probable allusion to the Pleiades: Remus on the Aventine Mount and Romulus on Palatine Mount saw, respectively, 6 and 12 bird flying (as mentioned 6 and 12 are the Pleiades visible from the Earth by eye).
We must remember that the Pleaides are part of the constellation of Taurus, whose zodiac sign begins on April 21st… The foundation of Rome has as date April 21st 753 b.C. .
It cannot be excluded that even the number of the Seven King of Rome originated, rather than from a historical foundation, from the need for sacred numerology in which the number “seven” holds a prominent place.
A small detail to keep in mind, is that Ovid was originally from Sulmona, a city at the feet of the Maiella Mountain Massif, consacrated preciselt to the Pleaide Maia.
It is therefore possible that an educated Roman, starting from the passage written by Ovid, was able to understand that the city born from Romulus’ furrow, was consecrated to the Pleiade Maia, considered by Ovid himself, the most beautiful one.
For the ancient Romans, the Lares were divinities who protected and safeguarded the individual, the family and the home. The divinity that is introduced in the verses is called “Bona Dea” (good goddess) and it too had a protective function.
Even the real name of the “Bona Dea” was never to be spoken; the first to reveal it, was Macrobius in the V century a.C. by whuch time the pagan world was almost at an end.
Macrobius confirms that behind the “Bona Dea” was hidden Maia.
It is therefore no coincidence that Ovid dedicates the opening line of the book of and about May to her.
The sentence in the graphic specifies a relationship between Vulcan and Maia, in which the god offered a pregnant sow as a sacrifice to Maia, every 1st of May, so that the earth would be pregnant with fruit.
Vulcan represented the protective fire; this places him at Maia’s service in the defense of the city.
The juxtaposition between Maia and the “Bona Dea” allows us to see from a new perspective an episode that took place decades earlier, which involved, among others, Cicero and Cesare.
P. Clodio. Pulcro, one of the most discussed characters in the entire Roman history, on the night of the 4th of December in 62 b.C., disguised himself as a woman to secretly participate in a very secret ritual of the cult of the “Bona Dea” to which the women of the aristocracy were responsible, which was carried out privately in the residence of a high magistrate’s wife and in the presence of the latter and the Vestals (thus indicates the importance of this rite): that night the rite took place in the home of Cesare, that at the time was Pontifex Maximus.
Pulcro was discovered and underwent a trial in which he risked the death penalty, whilst against him testified Cicero.
Cesare, who as Pontifex Maximus, was one of the few who knew the truth about Rome’s secret name, divorced his wife after that deplorable episode. This shows how important the rite was.
If naming the true patroness of Rome was such a serious crime, why didn’t Augustus kill Ovid?
Calliope’s speech seems to have been cut: in fact, she never mentions Romulus, while the other two muses whom Ovid makes speak before her, do it.
It is therefore possible that Emperor Augustus had the compromised verses eliminated. Those were the verses in which it was stated that Romulus gave the secret name to Rome (a fact present in many latin and non-latin sources), following the prophecy on the place where Rome would be born.
In conclusion, Emperor Augustus granted clemency because Ovid, it seems, never mentioned Maia’s name directly.
But there were, probably, also political reasons for this choice.

An Italian Summer — Part I
This is Part I of my travelogue An Italian Summer — starting with the eternal city of Rome.
Rome was not built in a day. No surprises — it took us four days to visit it and we were left wanting for more.
Rome is a veritable explosion of ancient history, art and culture. That also means it is thronged by enthusiastic tourists throughout the summer, and it is wise to plan in advance in order to avoid long queues and inconvenience.
The central location of our hotel — the Westin Excelsior — ensured we could reach most places of interest on foot, and get public transport for the others with ease. You will spend a lot of time outdoors in Rome, so choose location over amenities while picking a place of stay.
Let me walk you through our itinerary, answering some of the why’s and what’s alongwith.
We landed in Rome past noon-time on 3rd September and got ourselves a local SIM card and picked up our Roma Pass at the Airport.
There are a lot of posts on the internet debating whether the Roma pass is a good investment. Unless you are planning to vegetate at the Hotel, it is a no-brainer. It includes entry to the Colosseum & Forum, plus unlimited access to the public transport (Metro & Bus).
Get a cab from the Airport to the city centre, usually costs about €50–60. We freshened up at the Hotel, got ourselves a light lunch and started walking where our feet would take us.
The evening brought about an array of flavours. We ambled across the cobbled streets, got hold of every photo-op against pretty street cafes, saw miniature and life-size versions of wooden Pinocchios, and got our first lick of authentic Italian Gelato.
By the way, amidst all this, we also saw the Trevi fountain and climbed up the Spanish steps and saw a lovely sunset with a street musician singing Ed Sheeran in the background. The city of Rome is a gigantic museum — you just cannot stay away from history and architectural beauty.
We trooped back to the hotel early. Streets in Rome get rather desolate by about 9 pm, and roaming around on foot is not advisable.
The Roma pass includes priority access to the Colosseum (€18, otherwise). However, the authorities have placed a concurrent visitors restriction due to which one must also reserve a time slot at a cost of €2 per person here.
We had a slot for 12 noon so we had a relaxed start to the day. We had breakfast this day, and also the next 2 days, at this handy cafe called Xtra One Coffee at Via Lombardia. At our designated time, we entered the Colosseum through a priority channel, smirking at the long queues sweating it out for an entry. GET PRIORITY ENTRY EVERYWHERE YOU GO!
It is an awe-inspiring visual as one enters the colossal stadium. Though, thanks to repair work in arena area, there were steel scaffolds which ruined the authenticity of the surroundings. We plugged into Rick Steves’ audio tour as we entered and, while listening to its ‘bloody’ past, we roamed around its many tiers.
After a wholesome tour, we stepped out across the road to Ristoro Della Salute. And we were back in the queue for the Roman Forum by half past two. We spent a good half an hour waiting here (there’s no skipping this line). But it was well worth it.
Having read Julius Caesar as part of my ICSE syllabus, I was thrilled to be where it all transpired. The Via Sacra, Caesar’s grave, the Rostrum where Cicero and Antony spoke, the Vestal Virgins — it was like reading a book. and Rick Steves’ guide did complete justice to the experience, yet again.
Our next stop was the adjacent Palatine Hill (that’s where the word palace comes from) housing lush gardens and remnants of Rome’s glorious history. To be honest, if one intends to get into the details of the monuments scattered on this hill as well, it would be hard to do it the same day as the Colosseum and the Forum. The place shuts at 6pm, a fact that deprived us of a potentially lovely sunset from a vantage point situated inside.
After a long day, we headed to the nearby Gran Caffe Martini & Rossi to get an early dinner and some Sangria. What followed ranks among our top memories from the trip: a view of the Colosseum by night. That surreal picture summed up almost everything anyone asks for from Rome.
And that was Day 2.
This was our day of casual ‘walking around the city’ in between visits to the Colosseum and to the Vatican the day after. The idea was not to burn ourselves out in the first few days of the trip.
Rick Steves came to our rescue again. We picked up his walking guide “Heart of Rome” and headed out on the streets of Rome with our backpacks.
A bus ride from Bissolati to C.so Vittorio Emanuele, and we were at our first stop — Campo de’ Fiori, a lively market square with a dark history of public execution.
The colorful, busy market made for a great start. From here, we meandered through tourist laden streets, with historical nuggets strewn all around, to a centerpiece of Baroque art and architecture — Piazza Navona. The vast plaza is adorned with three majestic fountains including Bernini’s Fountain of Four Rivers, and Boromini’s imposing church facing them.
It was lunch time. While the piazza is lined with restaurants, we resisted the obvious options and walked into one of the adjacent lanes, and didn’t regret it one bit. As we walked the Via di Tor Milina, we bumped into merry accordion players, street bands playing with gusto and enthusiastic restaurant waiters offering us a ‘better’ deal. We chose a place closest to the music and downed some food with a serving of the much talked about Aperol Spritz.
With a fuller belly, we moved on to the iconic Pantheon, a monument preserved exceedingly well for its ~1900 year old history. Rick Steves has a dedicated audio tour of the Pantheon — you don’t need any guide thanks to that.
From here, Rick Steves was egging us to head to the familiar Trevi & Spanish steps area, so we looked beyond. Close to the Pantheon lies Largo di Torre Argentina, an important ruin and site of the murder of Julius Caesar — the senate was meeting across town on the day he was slain. Close to this was the Campidoglio — a hilltop square designed by Michelangelo with a statue of Marcus Aurelius on his horse marking the center and facades of conservatories marking its periphery. We spent some time visiting some of the relics housed in these buildings. These are covered under the Roma pass and could consume a good two hours if you are really into ancient relics.
Stepping out of the Campidoglio, we walked up the Altar of the Fatherland built in honor of Victor Emanuelle II in the early 20th century and boasting of an impressive facade. We could only spent about 20 minutes here since they evacuate tourists at 6pm.
Late evening took us back to the Spanish steps (a steep climb again!) and then to the Trevi fountain for a night time view which is highly recommended. We had an early start for the Vatican next day and we hadn’t really gotten rid of the jet lag, so this ended up to be another early night.
We had booked an escorted priority entrance to the Vatican on headout.com at 8am! While Vatican is accessible by train (Ottavio metro station), we took a cab and grabbed breakfast on the way. We made it in the nick of time only to be told that we were the only 2 people booked for the slot, and we could wait 30 minutes and join a full guided tour with 6–7 other folks, at no extra cost. w00t w00t!
Surely, the Gods had intervened. I have rarely ever gone for human guides, but the Vatican is a giant maze and it is highly recommended to book a full tour. It helped that our guide was knowledgeable and witty to match.
Keep a good 3–4 hours for a full tour of the Vatican, the Sistine Chapel and St. Peter’s Basilica (perhaps more if you want to climb up the Basilica’s steps to the dome). Even as you step out to the Vatican square, the plaza looks resplendent with fountains and an array of statues lining the surrounding buildings’ rooftops. Covering your knees and shoulders is advisable.
As we stepped out of the Vatican, we spotted a McDonald’s and that was lunch because, well, we needed a break from pizza & pasta. Already.
Before heading to Trastevere for our last evening in Rome, we did a detour to the Chiesa di Santa Maria della Vittoria which houses Bernini’s sculpture The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa — a statue you might remember from Dan Brown’s Angels & Demons. It is a church as grand as any other and an item checked off the bucket-list.
Trastevere is the trans-Tiber section of Rome. Due to its quaint and bohemian buildings and houses, Trastevere is pretty Instagram-friendly. There is an audio tour by Rick Steves on Trastevere as well, and we spent the first hour or so getting to know the history of the commune, walking the neighbourhood, and visiting the Church of Cecilia & that of Santa Maria.
It was Friday evening and weekend revelry was in the air. We passed a number of piazzas where locals had got together to enjoy some food, drinks and music. As the evening set in, we went back to Piazza Trilussa and saw an exhilarating band performance. Ponte Sisto — the bridge in front of the Piazza was also abuzz with street artists and beat boxers. It was a far cry from the vibe of central Rome, and it won’t be far-fetched to say that this was indeed the Heart of Rome.
We found a quieter alley for dinner at a fine restaurant called Latteria Trastevere. And with a long-ish goodbye walk, we boarded the tram from Trastevere to Venezia, where, to our surprise, there was a traffic stop due to a night marathon. So, we had to wait for half an hour under the Roman night-sky before taking a cab back to the hotel.
It was our last night there. We weren’t complaining.
Rome is a city that keeps giving. Every day spent, even visits to the same sites, at times, offered us a fresh perspective or a yet-unseen relic.
It is a modern capital city with its roots firmly planted in its past — be it the well-maintained ancient monuments, the social piazzas or the water pumps providing water to passersby — each one of them telling tales from a history as old as time itself.

Word of advice number one: when you next go on vacation, don’t wear new shoes on the flight.
Why? Well, it could be that the airline looses your luggage and you are doomed to wear the same pair of new shoes for days on end. And your feet will not forgive you.
Word of advice number two: Never, ever, go to Rome in August. Not if you value your life and well being in general. And especially not if you are adverse to high temperatures.
Our friends had warned us against this.
“Don’t go, it is too hot!”, they said.
“Never in August. You’ll die from the heat!”, they warned.
Did we listen? Well, of course not.
Our logic?
“Well, we always say we won’t go in August and that we’ll go some other time, but then we never go”, said my partner. I agreed. My partner was right. We always say we’ll go some other time, but then we never do.
So a couple of years ago we decided to go to Rome and check out the Eternal City.
E t e r n a l mistake on our part!
After paying Vueling Airlines (a low cost airline) for 2 pieces of luggage, we arrived at Rome’s Fiumicino Airport with a slight delay, but no suitcases.
We only discovered this after waiting for our bags for over an hour at belt #9.
I went to the baggage handling company in charge of our flight (turns out there’s more than one. Blessed capitalism!) and they told us they had no record of our bags on their system.
Yes, having been to the country in the past, in fact, as recently as last June, my first thought was “typical Italian efficiency”, but I was wrong to think that. The problem was not typical Italian efficiency, it was typical Spanish negligence.
As we would find out the next day, the bags had never left Barcelona.
The Italian handler made us fill a form; he put our details into the computer, and sent us off on our less than merry way with a reference number which, we would later discover, was incorrect.
Although no consolation at all, we were not the only people without luggage on our flight, there was, at least, one other.
So there we were at Rome’s airport with a driver waiting to take us into town for 50 Euros, something we thought would be a good idea since we didn’t know the city and we wanted not to worry about the bags.
He was very nice, and if he was upset at having waited for over an hour, he didn’t let on.
We got into his Ford Focus and made our way to the Città Eterna.
I have to say that the drive went pretty well, and that the country side was not exactly very pretty. It was, all in all, a bit odd.
First we were on a highway, then, after a while, we found ourselves in what can only be describe as ‘leafy suburbs’.
He didn’t take any major roads and, instead, chose one-way roads with large, tall, walls, behind which I can only imagine must hide beautiful private villas.
It was a long while before we approached something which resembled the outskirts of a large city.
Once there what we saw first was the usual dim urban landscape, typical of any major European city post 1950.
Large, ugly, square, brick and concrete buildings, with many stores along the way selling mostly urban goods: fast food joints, urban clothing stores, ugly furniture shops, and the odd newspaper stand.
Still, we were excited to be in Rome.
I mean, R O M E !!
Right?
Then, suddenly, something which would happen again and again -though we didn’t know it at the time- occurred: when we least expected it, and just before we entered a tunnel, out of the corner of our left eyes, we caught a glimpse of St. Peter’s, in The Vatican.
This was unexpected because we had thought that we would view that particular monument going up the Via Della Concilliazione and into St. Peter’s Square, like almost everyone else.
But it was not to be. We quickly crossed the Tiber and drove down the Corso Vittorio Emanuelle II and into our hotel near the Campo de Fiori.
We paid our driver, gave him a tip, then checked in.
The hotel was ok. The recepcionist was not really friendly and did that thing which so often happens in Europe, he spoke as if HE was doing you a favor.
As if HE was paying for you to stay at the hotel. Not rude, just a bit…what’s the word… condescending and aloof.
Regardless, we had gone to Rome to enjoy the place and that is what we wanted to do. So we quickly forgot about him.
We had asked for a room with a balcony, and they gave us that, which was nice. But we soon discovered that the a/c was, well, less than able. It made a lot of noise, but gave out little cold air. But I would only realize this later in the day. And especially so at night.
We were starving by now and wanted to a) see the city and b) get some clothes. We had nothing to wear. Only the clothes we had on and which, by now, were very sweaty. Did I mention Rome was hot?
We left the hotel, which was, it seemed, used to situations such as ours. “You’ll get your bags tomorrow”, said the receptionist/owner, and off we went to eat and do some shopping.
We found a small restaurant about 3 minutes away and sat down. We ordered one pizza for the both of us and something to drink. It was the best pizza we would have during the whole trip. It was that good.
The service, however, was pretty bad. I wouldn’t say it went downhill from there, but rather that the service in Rome was consistently bad day in, day out.
Our waiters over the next few days, it would seem, would find new and creative ways in which to outdo their colleague’s ‘performance’ throughout our stay. And no, we hardly spent a penny on tips while in Rome.
So, after having lunch and stopping off at the local grocery shop where we got basic eating and drinking supplies, as well as some toiletries, it was back to the hotel, quick shower, and out before the stores closed.
Rome was baking under the sun, and us with it.
Out we went into the Corso Vittorio Emanuele II and started walking East, with no particular place to go. Also, we didn’t really know which way to go. We were torn between wanting to see the sights, and our clothing needs, so we tried to concentrate very little on what we saw, hard to do since if you’ve never been to Rome, everything is new to you, even when nine or ten centuries old. Or more.
Eventually, we got to Via del Corso, but not before we stumbled on the Piazza Venezia and the enormous marble and stone behemoth to our right: the monument to King Vittorio Emanuele II, first King of Italy.
This is one of the monuments on my list which I would not really arrive at the way I had expected. When I say we stumbled, I mean it. It is gigantic, but it is not exactly by a major road, it is on a major square, but off to the right, so if you happen to be on the street and not turn right, you might not exactly see it. But then, once you do, you can’t see anything else.
I wanted to go to it (yes, its array of classical columns was calling me) and bask in its classical ‘interpretative’ colossal beauty, but it was not to be on that first day.
We had no time, it was hot, and we needed clothes.
We turned into the Via del Corso, and forgot about it.
Via del Corso is one of those major shopping streets in central Rome. Many of the major brands, and others not so major, are there. Although Rome’s high class shopping strip is the Via Condotti, which is further down the Via del Corso, to the right.
On the corner, just as you go into Corso, there is the Doria-Pamphilj Palace.
Serene and decorated in a wedding cake style, I was immediately drawn to it.
But didn’t go, and would, unfortunately, not get to go during the trip.
And that pretty much sums up the entire trip. I didn’t get to see, go or do many things.
So back to the Via del Corso, and our shopping. We had nothing to wear the next day, and clothes were urgently needed. So we spent the best part of the afternoon traipsing from store to store, looking for garments, and missing out on Rome altogether.
On a side note, I must point out that, by now, my partner and I were wondering how the people of Italy reproduced since, it was very obvious, all the men in that country were gay.
But I digress…Clothes-wise, our main hope turned out to be H&M, but, once we got there, almost at the end of the Corso, we discovered, much to our dismay, that there was no Men’s section there.
Can you believe it?
We had walked the entire length of the Corso in the hope of finding a place which might have something -overpriced- but my size. Fat chance.
Since at that point we were only about two blocks from the Piazza del Popolo, we decided to go there.
I have to say that by now, I was ready to be impressed, or something, and impressed I was.
I had long wanted to see the twin churches of Santa Maria in Montesanto (1662-75) and Santa Maria dei Miracoli (built 1675-79). And there they were, in all their Baroque beauty. I think this is the one time Rome got interesting that day. I would say it made the whole thing worthwhile, but it isn’t true.The day had sucked all along from the minute our luggage went missing. But that moment, when we walked into that space, covered in fatigue and sweat, the city seemed beautiful, the tourists a mere nuisance, the heat (and it was around 8:30 PM) almost tolerable.
It was magic. Rome was magic.
We stopped at the obelisk in the middle of the Piazza, an original comission of Sety I (later erected by Rameses II) from Heliopolis which stands in the centre of the Piazza, inside a fountain, and is the second oldest and one of the tallest obelisks in Rome (some 24 m high, or 36 m including its plinth).
It was brought to Rome in 10 BC by order of Augustus and originally set up in the Circus Maximus.
Once there, a tourist girl asked her friend if she could drink from the fountain. My partner overheard her and told her that he’d read that you could drink from any fountain in Rome, unless it specifically said not to.
She was happy about this, and we spoke with her for a couple more minutes. Turns out she was from Spain, and was there on holiday with a couple more friends from school. She must have been in her very early 20s. And she was lovely.
It was starting to get dark, and we decided to get back to the hotel. We couldn’t decide between catching a bus, taking the subway, or walking. So we walked back along the dark and not too busy streets of, as it turns out, downtown Rome. Soon we were back at the hotel, where there were no news about our luggage.
The hotel’s concierge really couldn’t care less, so we went to our room, had a shower and went out to have dinner, not too sure about where to do this.
We decided to follow the incoming crowd down one of the streets, and ended up at the Campo dei Fiori. It was teeming with life: children playing, musicians, flower vendors, Indian or Pakistani salesmen of trinkets.
In short, Touristland right there in front of us. The only Italians being the waiters at the Campo’s many restaurants. So in we walked, and decided that the one on the right, on the other side of La Carbonara Restaurant, where we should have dined, just as you walked in, would do. Mistake. The food, although ok once we got it, did not surpass the bad service of a place which doubled as a drinks bar and dance club after 11PM.
We kept getting food meant for other tables, everything arrived at odd intervals, drinks had to be ordered more than twice. In short, a mess.
But given the day’s big story, it really paled in comparison. We didn’t mind much that the service was so bad. I think we were relieved it was over more than anything else!
Afterwards, we went for a walk on the Tiber, and saw that, at night, it really came alive. What a beautiful city this is.
It seems like the good citizens of Rome have allowed for bars and stands to be set up alongside the banks of the river. We were immediately drawn by the music and the bright, intermitent, lights of the marquees.
We crossed the bridge, and went down to the riverbank. We saw a couple of small stands which were a sort of Godsend since they had one of the items we needed most: a phone charger!
Yes, ours were safely (we hoped) stored inside our suitcases, and these, somewhere in Europe. We then decided to go to one of the “bars”. A rugby-themed bar by the side of the Tiber showing New Zealand’s Rugby matches.
Yes, slightly surreal, but then Rome is slightly surreal.
We would have stayed longer, but we were beat. We had had a long day and were yearning for sleep.
So after a couple of drinks, we headed back to the hotel. The room was not exactly cold, although the imitation a/c had been on all afternoon, so we agreed to sleep with the balcony window open. And the air con on. So our first day in Rome ended.

January 4, 2022|Italy
As expected, very late last night, Boo and I got our test results back for the PCR tests we took late yesterday afternoon. Negative for COVID. So yay!
Except . . . when I went to wake up Boo this morning, she told me that during the night, she had a headache and sore throat. She had taken ibuprofen and the symptoms went away And she felt fine this morning.
So we went about our day as planned. We took a walking tour through Ancient Rome. We met the group near Trajan’s column then walked past ”the wedding cake,” the monument to the king who united Italy.
Our guide was OK. Informative but not that entertaining. On the upside, he didn’t sing, so that was a blessing.
The guide took us up the hill behind the wedding cake where we had a glorious view over the rooftops of Rome. We were there at the stroke of noon, so we could hear bells peal across the city.

I first visited Rome back in 2015, and it remains my favourite European city to this day.
Mainstream, I know. “What’s your favourite song, Wonderwall?”, I hear you ask.
Well, no (although I do love Oasis). Just hear me out.
I’m a firm believer that Rome’s reputation has suffered because it’s so popular. It’s as though people refuse to judge the city on its merit, so widespread is the knowledge of its undeniable appeal. Sometimes it’s important to take a step back, and to try and refresh one’s perspective.
I often struggle with cities. I don’t understand the appeal of London, living some 90 minutes away from it myself, and I’ve found the energy of big cities a little oppressive at various times in my life.
That wasn’t the case in Rome, though.
Down every street, and round every corner, there’s something to marvel at — some unwavering reminder of what our species has achieved, and how it has evolved.

The day out of Levanto was an early morning because of the train tickets we’d booked in Venice. We took a regional train to La Spieza, south of Cinque Terre and then a direct train to Rome. This train was different in that it had booths of 6 seats each. I asked Yuki if she felt like she was going to Hogwarts.
We arrived in Rome and had to walk 2km to the Airbnb apartment. We were surprised that a city steeped in such history would be covered in so much graffiti. It covers a lot of buildings, most train cars, all municipal work vehicles, and any spot like tunnels or under bridges that are easily accessible and discrete. At the same time, the cobblestone streets made it difficult to drag our suitcases and the narrow sidewalks littered with garbage were a constant obstacle course. For all the problems, it is perhaps surprising that the drivers almost always stop for you to cross the road if you step out in front of them. They don’t try to ignore you or speed behind you like in Canada. So at first we were hesitant to cross the road but soon became accustomed to finding a break in traffic and forcing the next car to slow down and stop for us.
We were pleasantly surprised that the Airbnb apartment was actually a one bedroom place and that we got our own room again.
Probably my favourite part of Rome is that there are ruins everywhere. We went out to see one attraction and on our way to finding a subway line we stumbled upon the Piazza di Porta Maggorie. There is a tram station beside the ruins of what use to be Rome’s old city wall where an aqueduct cuts through at 30m high and one of the gates to the city was a tomb to a slave that was freed and became wealthy as a baker.
Further on we walked beside the remains of an aqueduct, one of 11 that use to feed the 1 million inhabitants of ancient Rome. The aqueduct and city walls have openings which have roads going through them. Some of them are the original gates repurposed for roads but others are just large demolitions cut out of the wall.
Our attraction of the day was the Spanish Steps, located in the North East of the city. Photos made it look appealing but when we arrived around dinner time the square was packed with tourists and the stairs had become a de facto public bench. We walked up and read that the stairs were significant for connecting two parts of town at different elevations. Otherwise, there isn’t much to them and we were less impressed.
Surprisingly, we found a family run restaurant with an enthusiastic and very happy greeter and waiter. This fun meal would be an abnormally of our time in Rome where the restaurant was happy, joked around, and cared about the service and food that they served. For the remainder of our time in Rome, we would have difficulty finding good food and service.
Our day of sight seeing in Rome began later than expected but we took a tram and one of two subway lines to the Colosseum. There are hawkers everywhere trying to get you to join a tour group. They offered entrance in the next few minutes for 30 euros and said that the line was 2hr. In reality, the line was about half an hour and admission without any guide costs 11 Euro. It would seem, however, that tour groups would be the normal for all of Italy. Everywhere we went, we were mobbed by tourist groups, whether formed by a company or a sole person at the entrance. Some of the larger attractions also have self-guided audio tours and many people can be found standing awkwardly around the attraction holding half of a phone up to their ear.
Needless to say, Yuki and I didn’t use any guides. This meant that we didn’t actually learn anything while visiting the historic sites as there aren’t really any display boards. The only learning we did was by reading up on wikipedia after the fact.The tour groups looked slow and the tour guides seemed to drone on and on so it was nice to be able to go at our own pace and wander around instead of being stuck to a set path.
I wasn’t all that impressed by the Eiffel tower in Paris but the Colosseum was massively impressive. Stepping out of the metro station, the scale and size of the Colosseum is enormous. Even in ruin, it is wonderful in shape and form. From the outside, the form of the Colosseum is beautiful, with each successive arch and while deteriorated and broken, it is easy to image how much grandeur there would have been back in ancient Rome.
Entering the Colosseum was also spectacular. It is interesting to note that tickets to events at the Colosseum were free but seating was arranged by social standing with the wealthiest at the lower bowl and the poor, furthest at the top. Each of the arches at the base of the Coliseum was an entrance that lead directly to the intended seats. This eliminated cross contamination between social classes but also was incredibly efficient in moving people in and out of the stadium.
We walked around the lower bowl for photos and peered down into the galleries below the originally wood arena. The signboards said how there use to be mock naval battles but stopped after a renovation. it wasn’t clear if that renovation had to do with adding the basement or a perimeter wall. I cannot imagine how they would be able to flood the arena with a wood floor and not only support the weight of the water but also be waterproof at the same time.
After the Colosseum we had to wander around for a bit to find a place to eat, which was the normal Italian food, and then we sat outside the Basilica di San Pietro for a while because they close for lunch. Of note, there are some religious artifacts, including chains that held Saint Peter and a statue of Moses by Michelangelo. There were also some other tombs adored with skeletons which we found odd and the roof had a nice painting on it.
Then we walked back to the Coliseum to visit the adjacent Roman Forums. The ticket to the Colosseum includes the Roman Forums and Palatine Hill across the street. This is where the Roman government buildings were located and is nearby to a wealthy neighbourhood. What is most impressive about the forums is the height of some of the ruins, indicating that some buildings were huge.
The Forums are mostly ruins now but I was struct by how a much of it is brick. It seems that the romans built predominantly in brick and covered the structures in a concrete paste or marble. I’d known about the romans and concrete before but I didn’t realize that it was used as mortar between bricks and not contemporary concrete with aggregates and moulds. Only certain buildings, or parts of buildings, are constructed from stone.
By the end of the forums we were too tired to walk up Palatine Hill so we planned on coming back the next day because the tickets are valid for two consecutive days.
The next item on our list of places to visit was Trevi Fountain. We found a shop before the fountain where we bought postcards for 0.4 euro each. We thought this was pretty good because they can be as high as 1 and are usually 0.5 or above but we found another store later that had them for 0.3 euro. Oh well.
The fountain is probably the most photographed in Rome. It was also crowded and so it felt like a lot of the other attractions where we only had enough time to get in, take our photos, and get out. There didn’t seem to be any time to appreciate or enjoy each place, especially with the crowds.
From Trevi fountain we walked to the Pantheon, passing the Piazza Colonna, which is significant because the tall round marble Column of Marcus Aurelius recounts the conquest of the Emperor in relief carvings that spiral up to a statue at the top.
The Pantheon was as large as I’d expected it to be and enormously voluminous inside. Looking at the roof, we knew that the square recesses were to reduce the weight of the roof but we wondered instead why the roof couldn’t be thinner. Like the Colosseum and the Roman Forums, the exterior was all brick. Apparently it used to be faced in marble but over the centuries that was scavenged away.
After the Pantheon we walked to the Piazza Navonna which has another impressive, but smaller fountain. We took a peak inside the Saint Agnese but there was a Sunday service in progress and the space was surprisingly small, although ordinate.
We had our worst lunch lunch afterwards at a restaurant just outside the square. The service was terrible and the food wasn’t that great either. The worst part was that the waiter tried to take 5 euros tip from us and I had to yell at him to get all our money back. For hearing that Paris waiters were snobs, we didn’t have a problem there and found that Italy was generally much worse in the tourist areas but very good in the local parts.
We were going to take the bus back to Palatine Hill but we couldn’t find a place to buy tickets so we decided to cheap out and just walk back. Along the way we stopped at the Piazza Venezia and took photos of the Altare della Patria. This monument is a modern symbol to the city of Rome and has some newer statues.
There are a lot of steps to climb on the way up and the view from the top is okay, but not great. It’s possible to go to the top by elevator but it cost 7 euro and we didn’t think it was worthwhile. In some ways, this building gives an idea to the grandeur of ancient Rome and what it must have been like in the past.
At the edge of the Roman Forums we realized that we’d forgotten yesterday’s tickets so we weren’t able to get back in. Instead we walked around to the Circuit Maximus but I was disappointed to find a sloping field with barely any trace of a race course. The Circuit Maximus use to be the largest chariot race track in the Roman Empire and was also used for many ceremonies and parades. Today, it could be mistaken for an undeveloped site as there’s nothing but a walking path.
For dinner we tried to go to Sushi but it was a high class place with a long line up. Instead we went to a take-away shop but it took an hour for them to prepare it. Still, Yuki got her much desired sushi and we have a good dinner at home of the type of food we wanted to eat.
Yuki’s Dad wanted to visit the Vatican so we went there. It took us a long time to get through security because I picked the wrong line. There was a mass of people that split into four lines. The first two lines had a security checkpoint each but the second two lines funneled into a single checkpoint. We were in the second line and the people around us were quite aggressive to get to the front of each other.
Saint Peter’s Basilica, had been described to us as a lot of dead saints. Like all the other religious sites, it was highly decorated in gold paintings and large but wasn’t that interesting to us. Turns out, there are a lot of dead saints. We considered visiting the Sistine Chapel but it seemed far and likely to have a long line so we walked through the Basilica’s grotto and then went for lunch.
Everyone looked forward to lunch at McDonalds because it is a dependable staple to be the same everywhere in the world. At least, almost the same. The taste was slightly different but it was a welcome relief to all the plain food we’ve been having lately. We never thought that we would be so eager to eat at McDonalds for lunch.
The last place to visit in Rome was the Baths of Caracalla which we discovered was very close to the Circuit Maximus we visited the day before. We had to transfer between the two subway lines at the Rome train station so we also used that opportunity to buy tickets for Yuki’s parents to get to the airport as they would be going alone the next day. As with all things family related, it took a lot of explaining in three different languages to get the message through to her Dad who speaks English and Japanese and her mom who speaks Japanese and Thai. Yuki’s patience seem almost angelic for all the explaining and translating she has to do.
Frustratingly, the Baths closed early on Monday so we walked to them for nothing. Frances, who had visited Rome in August, recommended going to the Pyramide metro station and Eatalia, a department store of restaurants. It turned out to be a station beyond Pyramide so we had a tiresome walk and the building was actually more of an expensive health food store. There were three levels with restaurants but the main business was selling healthy foods and the restaurants looked posh. Dejected, we backtracked to a Ramen restaurant we’d passed walking there and ate a small early dinner because we were all still full on McDonalds for lunch.

To celebrate my 50th birthday, my best friend and I embarked on our first European adventure, with Rome as our initial destination. Upon our arrival, we were immediately struck by the city’s incredible scale and beauty. “Everything is so grand!” became our catchphrase — and it truly was. Down every street and around every corner, something extraordinary awaited. In the open-air museum that is Rome, forget the car, put on your walking shoes, and get ready to log 15,000 steps/day discovering the city’s landmarks and hidden treasures.
Before experiencing Rome in person, we’d spent months laying out our itinerary, starting with a Google map where we pinpointed the places we wanted to visit and marked the center with a figurative X. When we arrived in Italy, what had appeared on the map as a web of gray lines connecting landmarks was transformed into living, breathing Roman arteries bursting with vibrant culture and sensory delights. Serendipitously, the focal point marked by an X landed us in the heart of Rome at the Palazzo Navona Hotel, situated next to the Piazza Navona. It proved to be the perfect launching point for our three-day exploration of the Eternal City.

I took a three-day trip to Italy on New Years. It was always my dream to visit the great Ancient Rome, so you can imagine how excited I was for this trip. Throughout my visit, I experienced some wonderful places, great food, and met new people. I want to share with you the rookie mistakes that I made, the things I did right, and ultimately what I learned from this experience. Here are some tips for navigating your way through the beautiful city of Rome.
Pack well (and right!!): Extra clothes, check, portable charger, check, type C, F, and L power outlet plugs, not check. Seriously, I spent the first half of my day there looking for electronic stores with the correct power outlet adapters. I made a rookie mistake, and hopefully, you will not have to.
Don’t pay extra. If anyone tries to convince you that you have to pay to get into the Vatican, I will assure you that you don’t. As soon as I arrived at the Vatican, I was unpleasantly approached by a man who apparently had only two tickets left to sell for the Vatican. Most might think that they “got lucky” and that they had just made it there in time before tickets were sold out, but that isn’t the case at all. Just keep your head up and walk right into the Vatican. It’s free. Thankfully, binge-watching travel videos on youtube helped me with that one.
Take lots of pictures. If you are traveling along, you can even ask tourists to take photos of you! As a solo traveler, I had plenty of time to soak in all the views and take my time appreciating all the sights and wonders. It is nice to take some pictures so you can reminisce later (who knows when you’ll be back). If you want to take some pictures of yourself, ask tourists if they’d be willing to take it for you, you’d be surprised how much photography talent there is in the crowd. If you see someone who could use a hand, offer to help them take their picture, they might offer to take yours back. Well, hey, it worked for me.
Plan well! I packed my day with wonderful sightseeing adventures and activities. It is crucial to check openings of the different places, especially on holidays. Unfortunately, I missed out on the great opportunity of seeing the Sistine Chapel because it was closed on the new year.
Throw a coin (or two) into the Trevi Garden. Legend has it that if you throw a coin over your head into the Trevi Fountain, chances are, you will return to Rome. If you throw two, you will return to Rome and fall in love, and three, you will return to Rome, fall in love, and get married there. I don’t know if this has been proven correct, but it can’t hurt to take your chances either way. Unluckily, I didn’t get to throw coins into the fountain, but have no doubt; I shall return.
Check out what Italy is known for, then make sure not to miss out. I enjoyed some delicious Italian Ice Cream, Pizza, and House Wine. The wine is incredibly affordable in Italy. While in the restaurant, don’t rush to receive the bill. It is customary in Italy to stick around and have a conversation after a nice meal.
Fly Ryanair! This one is a little bit controversial. If you asked me then if I would fly Ryanair again, I would have said that I would absolutely not. Looking back though, I realize how convenient it was to have a cheap flight from London to Rome. Just make sure you read exactly what you need to do when buying the ticket so they won’t charge you extra for late check-in or carry-on bags. If you don’t want to experience flight delays though, don’t fly with Ryanair. They might have cheaper flights, but that doesn’t mean they come without a cost.
I hope asome of these travelling tips helped you out! I know that I need to take some of my own advice on my next trip to Rome.
Edit: This blog is a repost from 3 years ago when I first visited Rome. Hope you enjoy!

The OUP blog has an excerpt from Bryan Ward-Perkin’s The Fall of Rome.
It is currently deeply unfashionable to state that anything like a ‘crisis’ or a ‘decline’ occurred at the end of the Roman empire, let alone that a ‘civilization’ collapsed and a ‘dark age’ ensued. The new orthodoxy is that the Roman world, in both East and West, was slowly, and essentially painlessly, ‘transformed’ into a medieval form. However, there is an insuperable problem with this new view: it does not fit the mass of archaeological evidence now available…
The Fall of Rome is one of these things that varies from whatever perspective you take. I remember my Roman lecturer on my BA commenting that many historians felt Rome went into terminal decline during the third century. Over two hundred years, he dryly noted, must have been some decline. The British Empire has collapsed in the last century, are we walking in the ruins of a one mighty empire?
Yet Ward-Perkins is right. There is a change. Pottery becomes pretty cruddy stuff. Writing becomes much much rarer. Civic centres fall. If civilisation is living in cities, then there is definitely a collapse of civilisation. While it might not be visible over the course of a lifetime, it is there. It depends what questions you ask of the data. The grand durée of history doesn’t disappear simply because the individual becomes the fashionable thing to study in the Thatcherite era.
I remember being taught that Saxons didn’t really invade, they came over as farmers. The Vikings didn’t invade either, they were peaceful farmers with a bad press. It makes you wonder how and why a lot of weapons came to be invented with all these peaceful farmers going everywhere. Perhaps an understanding of barbarians might remind us why civilisation might be a good idea.

TLDR; I describe only this first stop of a recent 2-week trip to Italy — partly because of the initial strong and quintessential impressions I formed in this my first-time trip to Italy, and partly because the other dozen or so cities I visited which the reader can probably guess mostly echoed and nuanced these impressions.
Disclaimer: this is not meant to be fully representative of what you should expect when travelling in Rome. In fact it is probably a quite biased series of observations privy to my own meanderings, but I must say these feel very genuine and idiosyncratic of the city. All photos are unedited originals, and no AI was employed in the writing of this article. So Italians, feel free to bawl me out in the comments!
I am not an untraveled citizen of the world — — I’ve lived and toured all over Russia and China for years, for example — yet there are hundreds of countries I’ve never been to. Italy, for example! I realize this may be the exception to the rule for most Americans who can afford to cross oceans for travel, as Europe is a ready destination, whether to enjoy a summer out of school or participate in an exchange program because the cultural and linguistic barriers are lower than for Asia or Africa, for example.
Yet, I did not take preparation for this trip lightly. As I had done in my previous travels, I prepared as much as I could for the language, as I feel it is best to try to speak the local tongue not only out of respect for the people but also to enrich your own experience. Before traveling to Russia and China, for example, I had become fluent in those languages by my tried and true method. But for those I had a few years to spend, whereas this time I had just a few weeks. After skimming a long treatise on Italian grammar, I decided it was hopeless to memorize all the rules. I figured I would be best served in this time frame getting the gist of pronunciation and some basic phrases: what seemed to work well was opening up Google Street View to random locations in Italy, trying to guess the meaning of any signs or writing (graffiti included!) and speaking into Google Translate to check my pronunciation. Sometimes I was way off, but this made it fun! I also got some ‘street smarts’ of what to expect in random city locations. (Later on I had fun actually doing this live when traveling through city streets:
)
More formally, I transcribed Youtube videos (with captions to check my work) to polish listening comprehension. This is so much better than the old days of transcribing radio, and there’s a semi-infinite supply of great captioned videos out there. It’s nice that the graph shows, umm, statistically detectable progress over time!
I was still, however, pathetically prepared for the language. Luckily it is a Romance Language and thus not too far from English and Spanish, of which I know a little, so I could in principle struggle by. BUT, most importantly, essentially everyone we met in Rome spoke English! And when English didn’t pass the bar, they spoke Chinese! No joke, there is a sizable Chinese population in Rome running hotels, restaurants, taxis, and small shops, and I could converse with them absolutely fine!
Now the reader can imagine the usual hassle of international travel culminating in a teleportation to another reality outside the Fiumicino Airport. It looked not too dissimilar from JFK, to be honest. A Chinese driver picked us up, and we grilled him on all the ins and outs of living in Italy what with driving, shopping, eating, avoiding pick-pockets, etc. (he in fact spoke absolutely no Italian despite living there 14 years … that just shows you how strong the Chinese community is there!).
And I now transition to a series of disconnected, but in my view very profound, observations during my travel in Rome. What you will not see is any canned, touristy photos of say, the Colosseum.
Ah well, you’ll forgive me that one.
Every city has history, but in Rome it stares you in the face at every street corner. I mean, you’re walking along the street minding your own business and then the Pantheon is just there in front of you!
And plenty of modern shops and restaurants surrounding it from which to enjoy the view! (NB: these are usually not the better, more authentic restaurants).
Now this one really gets me, I mean is it just improbable or does this kind of thing happen every day: I’m walking through the park next to the Roman Forum, in the baking sun with my sandals feeling very historic and all, on a wide, dusty dirt path that must be trodden daily by thousands of tourists, and look down to pick up a dirty penny. I’m joking to myself, naw, could it be? Rubbing off the dirt, it is indeed no ordinary penny: it looks ancient! Well after some Google Image search it looks quite possibly to be not thousands of years old, but at least 200–300 years (a Vatican copper Quattrino from 1745?). Could also be a forgery to dupe stupid tourists like me, but I’ve been shown plenty of forgeries in my travels and they generally look good, with letters clearly visible and such, whereas this one looks a little too worn and bent by thousands of people stepping on it to make the trick worth it (probably about $10 by my reckoning based on eBay offers for ones in much better condition). Not a treasure exactly, and in its current foot-abused state of negligible archeological value (else I would have, ahem, turned it in to the authorities) but to grasp history serendipitously, and why me? Why now? This just made my day!
There’s no way I can do justice to the sheer volume of Classical Art in Rome, so I won’t even try. The Capitoline Museum, Borghese, countless cathedrals, … you will be overwhelmed by it, eyes and soul beaten to pure submission so you can barely issue a yelp of protest at the beauty in which you’re drowning. I will only say that on my first day in Rome I waited 2 hours in line to get into the Vatican Museum, and I have absolutely no regrets. Seeing this was an absolute “Aha!” moment for me:
And sorry, no pictures of the Sistine Chapel (it’s forbidden) to which this mere hallway led — — when you emerge into it you simply gawk in awe upwards at Adam touching the hand of God and the surrounding universe of imagery and forget where you came from.
Hidden Gems
Walking through the streets of Rome is like no other city I’ve been in. I mean New York is fast and vibrant, San Francisco friendly and upbeat, but Rome surprises you in a very peaceful, contemplative way. Like casually looking to your right, you see an alleyway entrance to an apartment building, and there’s a classical statue at the end in a little garden. Very nice!
Now this building across the street is most interesting, and the guard looks rightly serious about his job:
My usual gripe on the shortage of public restrooms in modern cities applies, but if you’re thirsty there’s a very nice thing in Rome: public fountains!
It has admittedly been decades since I dared drink from a public water fountain in the U.S., where the stale metallic quality in e.g. Central Park is like from a gym locker, but the water out of those Roman fountains is definitely decent! (after observing many others drinking first, of course).
I have to say I was not impressed with many of my compatriots (surmised by their accents) along the way — — one family accused us of ‘cutting the line’ at the Colosseum, which was patently false, and quite publicly made a ridiculous holier-than-thou scene of it. At restaurants there was almost always a very loud table of Americans with the worst language I have heard outside a drunken frat party. And at the Pantheon one very American-looking woman marched right up to the guard well after closing time and demanded “I want to go in there!” If the patience of the Romans hasn’t caved in by now, it must only be due to the compensating dollars rolling in, but that makes me a bit ashamed.
All I will say is I had pizza every day and never got sick of it! And that was of course just 1% of what we enjoyed …

For those unfamiliar with the Total war franchise it is essentially the dream game for military-history nerds like myself. It allows you to play as various different factions during a set time period- whatever era that game has chosen to focus on. Your aim as that faction is to conquer the map and build your empire. Unlike other history strategy games like EU4 or the Civ games, you can fight battles in real time on campaign maps. This is really what set total war apart and is why I fell in love with the games at a young age.
Of the various different time-periods Creative Assembly (the UK-based game developer) has done over the years the Ancient-Roman/Greek games have always been of particular interest to me. The idea of testudos, phalanxes and war elephants appealed to me in a way that things that came before such as Stone/Bronze Age warfare and periods that came after like the Medieval era could never fully equate to.
Needing to relax in my free time, as I am currently preparing for my COMPTIA Security + exam, I decided to play Rome Total War 2. However, the vanilla version of the game is a bit too normal and to spice things up you really have to be playing the DEI mod. If you were to sum up the DEI mod in one word it would be immersion. Multitudes of carefully researched new units, game mechanics and options have been added to the game.
All I needed to do now was pick a faction. Having recently done a Roman run and given that I’ve been reading and watching videos on the Punic war I wanted to give the Carthaginian Empire a good go. My aim would be to do what Hanno, Hannibal and Hasdrubal couldn’t. Conquer Italy.
Like in real life, in 272 BC Carthage has a tricky start. As a maritime focused, trading empire, stretched across the western Mediterranean, you find yourself facing threats from multiple directions. Your Spanish holdings are open to attack from savage tribes across the Iberian Peninsula, desert tribes to your south are ready to strike when they sense you are at your weakest and your holdings on the Island of Sicily are also under threat from the Greek city-state of Syracuse. And this is of course all before you come to the main emerging threat to your empire…the Romans!!!
No mean feat to be able to deal with such an array of threats. But wait there’s more. To make matters worse and in-accordance with historical accuracy, your land forces leave a lot to be desired. Carthage, as is the way with many trading empires, relied heavily upon their wealth to get mercenaries to fight their battles for them and only had a small core of their citizens as soldiers. The mercenary-centric nature of your armies could not be more strongly contrasted with the state-funded and citizen-staffed legions of Rome. Yet, there are some slightly redeeming features such as having superb cavalry, like Numidian and Iberian horsemen, and an array of aggressive light infantry mercenaries, which you can get from Gaul and Iberia. Whereas Rome goes for standardisation, to play to your strengths you should rely on the variety of mercenaries you can choose from.
With this all in mind, I devised a clear strategy. I would focus, as Carthage did in real life following their defeats in the 1st Punic War, on expanding my already existing Spanish holdings. I wanted to be able farm their resources and set up mines in order to fill my coffers for my future war against Rome. In essence it was a race against time- could I add Spain to my Empire before Rome came south and attacked me? In order to fulfil this strategy, I would have to leave other fronts less defended and accepted that some territorial losses like in Sicily or Africa would occur as a consequence of focusing on Spain.
Things kicked off to a terrible start. Whilst recruiting armies in Nova Carthago (SE Spain) to begin my bloody conquest of the Iberian Peninusla, Syrcause decided to launch a surpise attack on my Sicilian cities. They swiftly took my cities and liberated them to a Greek vassal of theirs. This was all part of the plan… I expected this to happen I reassured myself.
All was not lost, however, for two reasons. Firstly, through the use of trade and diplomacy I was able to prevent the desert tribes from attacking me to the south and I had secured my eastern border by establishing friendly relations with the Ptolemies in Egypt. Also by implementing a policy of Divide et Impera (see what I did there) I was now picking off one Spanish tribe at a time. Even better Rome had become mired in an attritional war against Epirus and then subsequently wars against raiding Thracian and Illyrian tribes. Again all I needed was time, even if they won those wars I would be strong enough to handle Rome on my own…if I conquered Iberia.
However, whilst I was getting closer to completing this goal, with my various armies subduing and annexing one tribe after another- disaster struck again. One of the Carthaginian noble houses revolted against my rule (the Barcid Family) and launched a revolt in my western African possessions . This threatened to stall my Spanish foray grievously. Luckily through the extra funds I was now receiving, I raised extra armies to speed up my conquest of Spain and through the use of my Numidian vassals I was able to simultaneously conquer Iberia and stave off the threat from the fifth column.
I was therefore ready to invade Sicily and take back what had once been Carthaginian. The invasion was swift and decisive. The Greek field armies, weakened by their own failed invasions, were swept aside by my invasion force. The siege of Syracuse was tough and bloody and after a desperate sally attempt by the defending forces; the city eventually fell.
Rome, seeing that I had taken all of Sicily for myself, declared open war against me. I knew I had to act fast, raising another army in Carthage and bringing my last army in Spain over to Sicily I was ready to invade Italy proper itself. My forces were able to overcome the two Roman legions defending their southern most province, Consentia.
Following this, Rome attempted to field 3 legions against my main force, however with fresh reinforcements coming in from Carthage and Iberia, I was now able to threaten multiple cities on the Italian mainland. After a great battle near Beneventum, I had crushed the last significant Roman force on the Italian Peninsula. It was a brutal engagement, which was won by my Iberian cavalry delivering a rear charge to their infantry and shattering their centre. After I secured my foothold in Magna Graecia, I finally marched on Rome. Following a direct assault on their city walls, the garrison of Rome was overcome and the city fell into Carthaginian hands. Rome was a broken power all that was left was to mop up the remaining strongholds it held on Italy.
So what are my reflections on playing as Carthage? Tough to be sure, particularly with the mod I was using. Fun?- Definitely, the initial position Carthage finds itself in requires planning and strategic foresight from the player. Although there were certain things the game cannot accurately represent and a couple of things which were a bit unrealistic, playing as Carthage is certainly something I would recommend to any person considering checking out the DEI mod. It is probably not as fun as Rome, the mod is built around playing as Rome, but as my Carthaginian campaign shows, you can still have a whole lot of fun roleplaying an alt-historical scenario such as winning as Carthage during the Punic Wars. These what-if scenarios have always fascinated us amateur military historians because we get to relive the strategic decisions that generals went through and it is exciting in itself to see how a different military strategy could have enabled a losing side to win and changed the course of history.

A Place to Be Funny Without Being a Jerk

Member-only story

January 2, 2022|Italy
Today was a quiet day. We said goodbye to granny’s apartment in Assisi and boarded the train to Rome, our final stop in Italy.
The train trip from Assisi to Rome is not nearly as picturesque as the trip from Florence to Assisi. Fewer vineyards, fewer olive groves, fewer castles, no snow-capped peaks in the distance. We did see a few notable sites, however. In particular, we passed by Trevi (the town, not the fountain) which is one of those classic medieval towns where the church is on the peak of a hill and the rest of the town seems to tumble down the hillside.
We also passed by some random towers and fortifications that don’t seem to be guarding anything more interesting than a parking lot and a smattering of houses these days.
As we approached Rome, the surroundings, unsurprisingly, got more industrial and grittier. We passed by nondescript apartment blocks and graffiti that could have been in almost any city in the world.
We arrived a Termini station and seemed to walk for a mile to get to the exit. Then we hopped into a cab which proceeded to gouge us unconscionably. I’m too irritated to go into detail but it…

The professor showed us a photo of an insect.
“What is that?” he asked us.
A cricket.
“What would you think if you saw it on your bed?”
Get it off my bed.
But would I think the same way if I grew up in another part of the world?
Crickets.
Stepping on a plane to Rome, I did not expect that a metaphorical cricket would be one of the most important things I took with me on the plane back. But, here we are.
I recently spent two weeks in Rome, Italy, taking an international business class through Marquette University’s summer study abroad program.
We spent much of our time learning about how to do business in a global market and how to understand cultural differences. We also toured businesses in Rome and saw how global companies operate. We spent time exploring Rome and of course, eating a lot of gelato.
I had never been abroad. I had never even taken a business class. But this program expanded my view of both in new ways.
They say when in Rome, do as the Romans do. When I was in Rome, I saw firsthand how we all do as our culture tells us to do. But I also learned how to bridge those divides.
I have taken international advertising and public relations classes so I had some knowledge about global business before I went. I knew about high context and low context cultures. I knew about the importance of a power index to some cultures. I thought I understood it — but being abroad changed my perception on culture.
We are all told to live by the golden rule: treat others as you want to be treated. This doesn’t apply in other cultures. Here’s why.
Professor Kevin MacGabhann from the Strasbourg Business School in France was the professor who pulled up a photo of a cricket. He eventually explained.
In America, we see crickets as pests.
In Thailand, crickets are a popular snack.
In China, crickets are pets.
We might find customs strange if we’re not used to them. But once we learn more, we can understand it.
Most people understand that cultures build bonds and also create differences among groups of people. We can then begin to understand those differences as we learn more.
Professor MacGabhann showed us that understanding is only the first step. We need to recognize these differences in ourselves. We might find it abnormal that people eat crickets, but they might find it abnormal that we kill them.
Cultural differences are two-sided; we need to recognize the differences in both directions.
After we recognize our own cultural differences, we can begin to adapt. This is the most crucial step. Treat others as they want to be treated.
Treat others as THEY want to be treated.
When we are among different cultures, we need to adapt to their culture. Without doing that, we will run into tension and problems. That does not mean we need to go out and buy a cricket to keep in our room or eat one with dinner. It means if we are in Thailand, China, or somewhere else, we shouldn’t step on a cricket.
And maybe you are already adapting — you can get a cricket lollipop in Waukesha or a grasshopper taco at Belair Cantina not too far from campus.
In the context I learned them, these points were geared toward international business relations. However, they do not stop there.
I think that this point is so important no matter where we are. There are different cultures within schools, neighborhoods, work environments. We need to understand, recognize, and adapt whether we are in the Marquette bubble or across the world in Rome.
We need to understand, recognize, and adapt whether we are in the Marquette bubble or across the world in Rome.
I know that now I am going to look at my everyday life differently. I will pay more attention to the cultures surrounding me and do my best to learn and adapt.
I want to travel abroad again. I want to find new cultures and learn about them and try to adapt to them. But I do not have to go far to do that. I will start where I am and hopefully that will lead me across borders again.
Because abroad or not, I want to remember to do as the Romans do. Treat them how they want to be treated.

The Vestal Virgins inhabited a unique space in Roman society. They were the most prominent women in Rome, heavily revered and with privileges no other woman was given. But they also lived with extreme duties and restrictions. Their most famous restriction is obvious from their title: every Vestal was unmarried and pledged to remain a virgin through her thirty-year term of service. And a Vestal who broke her oath of chastity was buried alive.
But how often was this extreme measure used? And when it was, what did it look like? I have been researching Vestals for a few years as I work on a historical fiction novel centered around one (coming soon, I hope), and I’ve had to get into the nitty gritty details. Here’s what we know about the ultimate punishment for Rome’s most sacred virgins.
Before we bury one alive, let’s make sure we know who the Vestals were.
People ignore Vesta, but she’s one of my favorite goddesses, and was one of the Romans’ favorites too. Her duty doesn’t sound like a big deal today — goddess of the hearth, the fireplace. Modern people tend to think, “why have a goddess for that?” But for the ancients, the fireplace wasn’t just something to get cozy by to drink hot chocolate. It was the source of fire for the house, meaning the light for their lamps and the heat that cooked their food. Without Vesta’s flame, a house was vulnerable and unlivable. Vesta made a house into a home.
Sure Vesta isn’t as splashy as some other deities — she’s a virgin goddess so she doesn’t have relationship drama, and she’s a guardian of the home so she doesn’t leave to have adventures. But to the ancients she was steadfast and ever-present, a goddess without whom life would have been impossible.
Vesta’s private role as protector and life giver to the household was reflected in her public worship. There was a shrine to Vesta in the Forum Romanum¹ tended by the Vestal Virgins, who kept her sacred flame burning. Just as a house must have a hearth to make it a home, Rome was not Rome if the eternal flame was not burning — the flame represented the safety of Rome, and the favor of the gods that allowed Rome to hold its vast conquered empire. It took 24-hour maintenance to keep the sacred flame from going out. The Vestals also prepared the sacred grain/salt mixture that was sprinkled on the head of every sacrificial animal, so in a real way, Roman religion would have been nothing without them.
This legal status of the Vestals was unlike any other woman’s in Rome. For the ancient Romans, one of the essential characteristics of a woman was male control: she belonged to either her father or her husband. Widows with no living father had to pass into the legal control of a living male relative.² Unfortunately, the notion of women belonging to men is not strange to us. But male control of women was much more deeply entrenched in the Roman legal code than it ever has been in ours, and freeing the Vestals from that control put them into a shadow category, a zone that was neither masculine nor feminine. They could make wills and testify in court, which other women could not because they weren’t considered autonomous. They were also sacrosanct — it was illegal for men to touch them — and bizarrely sacred — if a Vestal accidentally met a man on his way to execution, his life would be spared.
After their thirty years were up, Vestals could do as they wished. Many chose to marry (and apparently men really loved marrying former Vestals, which seems like a lot we could unpack but I’m choosing not to). But many chose to continue their legal limbo — if she married, the former Vestal rejoined Roman society as a wife, reentered male control in the household of her new husband. An unmarried former Vestal was still a woman apart, the only truly autonomous woman in ancient Rome.
In short, Vestals were separate from Roman society, even as they lived in the middle of it. They were separated legally, and they were separated from close contact. They were not Romans really, but something else… they were representatives of all Romans, and of Rome itself.

But I promised I’d tell you what happened when a Vestal Virgin was convicted of violating her oath of chastity. For a Vestal, having sex was a betrayal of her promise to Vesta, an act which would put the safety of Rome in jeopardy. The virginity of average Roman girls and women was controlled in similar (though not identical) ways as in many societies today, but that’s not really what was going on with the Vestals. A Vestal’s purity was supposed to be a requirement for the proper public worship of Vesta, and Vesta’s worship guaranteed the safety of Rome. So an “improper” Vestal would lead to a loss of favor with Vesta for all of Rome — big trouble.
The accusation of inchastity could come in a few forms. It might come from a man — from someone who had heard of an affair, or maybe (though less likely for reasons that will soon be obvious) from the man who’d had sex with her himself, in a moment of repentance.
But, since a Vestal having sex was supposed to be an affront to the gods, the accusation might also come in the form of prodigies. Prodigies were messages from the gods in the form of unexplainable and supernatural events — calves born with two heads, lightning striking prominent monuments, etc. Two examples that stick in my mind are a soldier’s shield falling from the sky and a fully intact human head being found in the ground when digging a foundation. Prodigies sent the Romans to their priests, who would interpret the message and tell the citizens what action the gods required from them.
Some prodigies were good, but many (perhaps even most) threatened doom unless the gods were appeased. And sometimes the omens pointed a finger at the Vestal Virgins, and one or more of them would be accused of violating their oaths without any earthly evidence.
After the accusation, a trial. This was not the same as the trial of a citizen: it was a religious trial with the Pontifex Maximus as judge and the Pontifical College as jury.³ The priests would vote to convict or acquit. If they convicted her, the Vestal would be executed.
The doomed Vestal was carried, gagged, through the streets in a litter that had its coverings fastened down with cords; she could be neither seen nor heard. Crowds followed the litter, but it was apparently a solemn and silent occasion. She was brought to a tomb buried under a ridge of earth near the Colline Gate, on the north side of the city. Paradoxically, the tomb of disgraced Vestals was the only tomb allowed to be inside the city walls.
The tomb was stocked with provisions: bread, water, milk, oil, a lamp, and a bed, as if the Vestal was expected to go on living inside. Her litter was unbound and she was led, heavily veiled, to the steps to her tomb. Then the Pontifex Maximus said a prayer, and all the pontifices would avert their eyes as the Vestal went down, to avoid witnessing the moment of shame.
The tomb was buried, and the Vestal was left to die down there, no grave marker to commemorate her improper death.
The Vestal’s lover would then be subjected to a public flogging. Whipping was a common punishment — the pain was part of the point, but it was more about the public shaming. These floggings could leave the man alive, or they could be carried to the point of his death. Or, if her lover saw all this coming, he might just flee into self-imposed exile.
It was common for upper-class men in Rome to escape into exile if they knew they were about to receive a punishment that would either a) permanently mar their reputation or b) kill them. Rome tolerated this sort of thing and made no effort to hunt down the fugitives — a man who saw a trial turning against him would often leave town at night and face no consequence other than his loss of status. In the eyes of the ancient nobility, that loss of status was punishment enough… but when you put it on a scale next to “buried alive,” yeah, not so much. It was very possible for a man to escape with his life if he were accused of sleeping with a Vestal, and very difficult for the Vestal herself to do the same.
medium.com
The live burial of a Vestal was, importantly, bloodless. The Romans didn’t kill the Vestal — they put her in a room with the essentials of life to sustain her, and she died without their intervention. (Yes, I am aware they buried her in there; this is ritual, not logic.) It also offered the convenient out that the goddess could, if she so chose, save her priestess and prove her innocence. (I’m not sure if this was something the ancient Romans thought or just a modern supposition.)
The burial can also be meaningfully thought of as a human sacrifice. The gods were upset, and the Romans were offering up one of their holiest priestesses to soothe them. Human sacrifice was unthinkable to the Romans of classical times, but many of their religious rituals had much older roots in prehistory. Meanings got twisted and lost. The Vestal Virgin might originally have been a scapegoat, which would explain why she was kept so carefully between categories: she was no one’s wife and no one’s daughter, so she had no family to demand retribution for her death.
This quality of being outside categorization, and thus available as a sacrifice, might also explain why the Vestals had to be virgins in the first place. In a society in which a woman’s identity was totally dependent on her relationships with men, the sacred virgin stood apart. When they worshipped Vesta, the Vestals acted for the entire city: they could not represent the daughters, wives, or mothers of Rome (as other priestesses did); they had to be blank slates, to represent all Rome. Virginity meant lack of connections.
In short, a properly chaste Vestal was Rome itself. For the Romans, her purity was the safety of Rome, and when she lost it — when she slipped out of her symbolic role and back into worldly society by coming under the sexual “control” of a man — she had to forfeit her life as a sort of sacrifice to appease the gods. This she did in a method devoid of the kind of violence that would have sullied her further.
The immurement of a Vestal was a very rare occurrence. We only know of a few instances in all of Roman history.
Most of the Vestals who went on trial in the historical record were acquitted, not executed. In early history, we get the story of two Vestals who miraculously saved themselves from accusations of wrongdoing. When Vesta’s flame went out (usually interpreted as a sign of Vestal wrongdoing), the Vestal Aemilia threw her sash on it and it miraculously roared back to life, saving her. And a Vestal named Tuccia in the 3rd century BCE cleared her name by carrying water across the city in a sieve without spilling a drop. Vestals, as holy women, were supposed to be able to work miracles. Continuing to work miracles proved the continuing favor of Vesta, meaning they must still be virgins. (How or if these magic tricks fit into the formalized trial structure, I’ll never know.)
In 114 BCE came a bizarre prodigy: the young daughter of a prominent Equestrian was struck by lightning while riding her horse, and was found dead with her tongue sticking out and her dress hiked to her waist. Officials interpreted this as a sign of a scandal between an Equestrian and a Vestal Virgin. (Obvious, right?)
Three Vestals were accused: they said that Aemilia (not to be confused with the earlier miracle-worker) had become corrupt herself and then led the other two, Marcia and Licinia, into vice with her. Aemilia was convicted by the Pontifical College and executed, but the other two were acquitted.
What followed was outrage. The Roman people were convinced that there was a conspiracy of priests covering up the widespread corruption of the Vestal Virgins, and that the other two Vestals were also guilty. So in 113, a Tribune held another trial for the other two Vestals, moving it out of the Pontifical College and into the traditional court system. This trial resulted in a guilty verdict, and Marcia and Licinia were also executed.⁴
Emperor Domitian executed four Vestal Virgins starting in 87 CE. This was part of a push toward cracking down on public morality: like many reformers before and after, Domitian believed that people’s morals weren’t what they used to be, and that he could bring back the good old ways by punishing people for acting wrong. (Yeesh.) Domitian was also notoriously hostile toward the senate,⁵ and since the Vestals were the daughters of senatorial houses, killing them was a way to show the nobility who was boss. Since the emperor was always Pontifex Maximus, Domitian ran the trials and had no trouble securing convictions.
The first three convicted Vestals were actually not buried alive. Domitian allowed them to choose their method of execution. Only for the last, the Chief Vestal Cornelia in 91, did he insist on the ancient punishment. Which makes for an interesting point: we don’t know if the Vestal executions I described earlier were by burial. As far as I can tell, Cornelia is the only verifiable instance we have of a Vestal being buried alive. We know that the Romans considered this the ancient, traditional punishment, but we don’t know of anyone else it happened to.
Cornelia used the big public spectacle of her immurement as a platform. She announced to the crowd before the descended the steps: “Caesar thinks me unchaste, me who performed the sacraments under which he won, he triumphed?” Because, of course, a successful Domitian meant the favor of Vesta; if the empire was doing well, then surely that meant Cornelia was actually innocent.
On her way down, Cornelia stumbled, and the soldier accompanying her put out a hand automatically to help her. But Cornelia kept her balance without him and shied away from his touch — a sign to those watching (according to Pliny the Younger who recorded the incident) that this Vestal was so chaste she would not even accept the sacrilege of a man’s touch on the way to her execution.
And that’s about it for historical examples. There are vague insinuations of other Vestal executions, and concrete details of many other trials that resulted in acquittals, but we only have that handful of confirmed Vestal deaths, only one of them definitely by live burial. So though this sensational and very public punishment cast a long shadow over the lives of thousands upon thousands of Vestals who would never experience it, actual instances were vanishingly rare.
Which leaves us with two possibilities:
I’m inclined toward option 1 — probably there were instances of option 2, but the Rome I know was sincere enough in its religious beliefs that I have a hard time believing they were all openly flaunting tradition but not writing about it. I also think that the Roman men who wrote the histories had a hard time believing in a group of women who are uninterested in sex, and felt it necessary to imply that there had to be something going on there (when really, the something was worshipping Vesta). But historically, of course, it’s unknowable.
The Vestals were women who lived outside Roman society even in its very heart. From them we can learn much about Roman religion and Roman womanhood — and we can glimpse the sinister reasons for the policing of their virginities. The Romans held the Vestals up high when they were shining examples of Rome’s piety, and struck them down as low as they could when they became evidence of Rome’s corruption. The Vestal Virgins may have been the six most important women in all of Rome.
¹We usually call it the Temple of Vesta, but a Roman temple had to be planned out by augury (which Vesta’s wasn’t) and traditionally contained a statue of the deity (which Vesta’s didn’t). It was also rather small.
²In actual practice, such widows were usually fairly independent. But the fact remains that there was a legal requirement that they be in a man’s control.
³The Vestals were part of the Pontifical College, so the Vestals who had not been accused would have voted on the guilt or innocence of their colleague. Roman juries did not have the same ideas around impartiality as ours — in fact, it was considered an advantage if members of the jury to know the accused well, since their opinion of their character had weight in the case!
⁴This was a big move, the imposition of the civil government into what was supposed to be a religious matter. The boundaries between state and religion were a lot more porous than they (ideally) are today, but still — it was an insult to the priests, whom the politicians accused of not being able to handle their duties.
⁵There’s a probably-untrue anecdote in Cassius Dio in which Domitian invited senators to dinner and had gravestones for each of them made to put in their seats.

Rome is one of the world’s great cities to visit. Filled with antiquities, wonderful historic sites, lovely old neighborhoods and great restaurants, it’s also a fantastic walking city. The running scene has been improving. Yes, there are busy, traffic-choked roads, tangled lanes difficult to navigate, and the air quality can be poor in the summer — but there are great places to run within proximity to where most travelers stay. Highlights of Rome running include a nearly 9-mile “Rome Sights” tour, including some of the principal landmarks and historic sites (go early or on Sundays!). Running along the Tiber River can be a pleasure, especially since a bike path along part of it was put in a few years ago. Rome’s three largest parks - Borghese, Ada, and Pamphili are also terrific for running. And running on the historic Via Appia Antica and the Parco de Caffarella is one of the most unique runs in the world.
Running in Rome will undoubtedly incorporate some of its famous “seven hills” east of the Tiber, as well as Vatican Hill and Janiculum northwest of the river. In terms of public transport, there is are two metro lines, which go round rather than through the historic city. There’s an extensive bus system.
Rome’s weather is Mediterranean. Summers are hot and dry and can be uncomfortable for running. Spring and fall is almost perfect for running. Winters are mild to cool but rarely cold, with moderate rain. Snow and freezing temperatures are rare.
8.6 miles,with options. Start: near St. Peter’s Square or any point. MAP
This is an attempt to put together a tour of some of Rome’s principal sights. Best to do it early before the streets get crowded and to beat the heat. See this as a ‘city tour’, and take your time! The map starts at Ospedale Santo Spirito, right near St. Peter’s Square, or at any point convenient to where you’re staying. The route follows the outskirts of St. Peter’s and Vatican City (without going into it). Then, just off Via Crescenzio is Castel St. Angelo. Cross the Ponte Cavour, over to the Spanish Steps and the Piazza de Spagna. Then, over to the Trevi Fountain and the Piazza Venezia & Piazza St. Marco. Skirt the Capitoline and the Roman Forum by running along Via dei Fori Imperiali to do a tour of the Coloseum, and then through the Circus Maximus.
Shorter option: take a right out of the Circus Maximus and head over to the famous Ponte Palatino. Cross the bridge and return to St. Peter’s along the river path.,Longer option: takes you through the Trastevere area, near the Passeggiata del Gianicolo, and via Garibaldi back down to the river. Add on even more by going up to Villa Doria Pamphili park.
7 miles ONE-WAY. MAP Start: North: Stado Olimpico. South: Ponte Guglielmo Marconi
Running along the Tiber River in Rome is a great way to go for a run and see the city without dealing with traffic and intersections. Several years ago, the city completed a bike path that runs nearly 7 miles from near Olympic Stadium to Ponte Guglielmo Marconi.
The trail runs through the heart of the most visited sections of the city, but below the roads. It’s a great way to do a dedicated run or to use it as a link to other sites or routes. Note that the path can get flooded fairly easily, often leaving behind a muddy mess. The northern section of the path officially starts south of Olympic Stadium but we start the run at the stadium, since it’s a thrill to see it and do a lap around the track. The southern section concludes at the Ponte Guglielmo Marconi. It is also possible to run on the eastern section of the Tiber.
7 miles Out and Back. Start: Circus Maximus Metro Station. MAP
The Appian Way is one of the earliest and most strategic roads of the Roman Republic. Sections of it remain, and it makes for a one-of-a-kind run. Even the marathon in the 1960 Rome Olympics had a section on this road. On a map, it is called “Via Appia Antica”. The surface is the original stone slab, which can be a challenging surface after a time. However, there is a path alongside for much of the way to ease the run. It is possible to run about six miles south to the perimeter road. The road is generally quiet and is closed to cars on Sundays. Our route starts at the Circus Maximus metro station. A nice option is a loop around the Circus Maximus or use the river path. Viale delle Terme di Caracalla is a good option on the return.
A great option is to combine the Appia with the miles of paths in gorgeous Parco Della Caffarella, where you can combine a run with a visit to the Catacombs. The park is more rural and agricultural in nature, with dirt paths though gorgeous green fields. A very different feel than the busy center city or the more manicured Roman parks such as Villa Ada.
~3 miles. Start: Piazza del Popolo, or Spanish Steps/Porta Pinciana. MAPAdd-Ons: Villa Ada Park, or paths along Tiber River.
At 148 acres, this is the third largest park in Rome. It is centrally located and makes for a great run. It’s possible put together a run of about 3 miles along the paths of the Villa Borghese. Sites include the Villa Borghese Gallery, lovely gardens, Museum of Modern Art, boating lake, and Piazza Napoleone. The paths are wide and gravel, and fairly shaded. Due to its central location, Borghese can be accessed via the Piazza del Popolo or the Spanish Steps/Porta Pinciana, among other options. A nice add-on/combination run is Villa Ada, which is another large park in Rome, less than 2 miles away. Use Via Salaria or Viale Romania. Guided walking tour here.
3 miles of paths. Start: Piazza Bligny. Easily accessed via bus. MAP
At 450 acres, this is Rome’s second largest park. It is more wooded and less finely manicured than Borghese or Pamphili. A private area is under control of the Egyptian embassy. The park has an artificial lake, a public swimming pool, and one can rent canoes, bikes, or horses. In summer there’s the Rome Meets the World Music Festival and numerous other outdoor concerts. For running, there are numerous paths throughout the park, including the perimeter of the fort, totaling ~3 miles. For a longer run, combine with Villa Borghese Park, taking Via Salaria, Via Panama, or Villa Romania to Via Giaocchino Rossini.
~10k of trails in the park. Start: in park,or accessible from St. Peter’s Square or Trastevere area.
Rome’s largest park, Villa Doria Pamphili, contains a stunning, mid- 17th century palace surrounded by garden mazes, jogging trails, fabulous fountains, a superb grotto, and pine lined views of Rome from atop the Janiculum hill. Note that there are not maps inside the park. Your best bet is to run the perimeter paths, which add up to ~10k. There are bathrooms and water fountains near the park entrances.
Good running options to/from the park: From Ponte Sisto, Via Garibaldi, passing through the Trastevere neighborhood and by important landmarks such as the Piazza de Santa Maria, Basilica di Santa Maria, the floodlit Fontana dell’Acqua Paola, and the Garibaldi statue. Mix it up by going through the Passeggiata del Gianicolo monument with the cannon that goes off at noon, or the switchback road, Passeggiata del Gianicolo. This makes for a ~2.5 mile loop, to and from the park.
2–3 miles within site. 2 miles to sea and then along water for 1–2 miles.
Ostia Antica was the harbor city of ancient Rome. It is now a well-preserved archaeological site, about about 18 miles northeast of the city and 2 miles from the Mediterranean. It is a popular tourist destination due to its ancient buildings, frescoes, and mosaics. It’s also easily reachable from Rome via a 1/2 hour train ride and is only a few km from the airport. Ostia Antica makes for a good running option along its ancient roads. The stone surface is similar to the Appian Way, although there is grass/dirt on the side as well. It is about 1.2 miles from one end to the other in the Ostia Antica site (admission required). There are numerous add-on options. There are lovely farm fields on either side of the Antica site. Or, run to the sea, about 2 miles, and then along the water, where there is a separated bike path from Faber Beach to the port, and then a nice jaunt out to the harbor.
Like any major European city frequented by tourists, there is a huge choice of places to stay. Pretty much anywhere you stay in the most visited parts of Rome will provide access to some of the runs in this guide. A few recommendations, for runners.
There are not as many specialty running stores in Rome as in other cities of its size. Each of the major running companies — Adidas, New Balance, Puma, and Nike has a store neat the Villa Borghese. A few of the specialty stores.
Footworks. Centrally located in San Giovanni area. Also close to Villa Ada and Parco Caffarella.
Born to Race. 2.5 miles south of Vila Doria Pamphili
LBM Sport. 1.5 miles north of the Via Appia

When I tossed a small Italian lira coin into the Trevi fountain back in June 1987, it was to ensure my return to Rome someday, in accordance with the famous legend. On the cusp of turning 17, I had all the optimism in the world that I would indeed be back. And I was right. It just took a few decades. But lucky for me, Rome is known for being eternal and was waiting here for me.
A lot has changed since I was last here. My sunken coin is, of course, long gone. The lira isn’t even Italy’s currency anymore, having been replaced by the euro in 2002. Most importantly, I now have a greater appreciation of history than I did as a teenager. Back then, I just wanted to meet European boys, get served alcohol underage, and go out dancing with my friends. My pictures were mostly of our silly fun in hotel rooms or on the bus, and my more serious scenic ones came out dark, blurry, or had my finger in them.
This time around, I plan to mix sightseeing and trying to live like a local for a month, much like I did when I spent 30 days in Paris working remotely last summer. Exploring all of the Roman ruins there inspired me to head right to the source. My great-grandparents came to the United States from Italy, so I also want to soak in the Italian culture on a deeper level and make time for some quiet moments sitting in parks just observing people or while walking ancient roads like the old Appian Way.
I only had a few days to see the famous Roman sites that summer of ’87 so long ago. I was on a “Discovering Europe” group tour of around 50 people, mostly high school students and some parent-chaperones, which was arranged by my high school Spanish teacher. We had 24 days to see nine cities in four countries. Rome was a blur. I mainly remember our tour of the Colosseum, seeing where the Pope lives, and not liking the pizza.
I actually still have the travel journal I kept on that trip and dug it out of storage recently so that I could refresh my memory and maybe have a few laughs. It did not disappoint. Page after page of black cursive handwriting captured my deep teenage thoughts.
“I don’t like Rome at all. Our hotel room is right by a busy street. And just like in Paris people drive like maniacs beeping horns all the time.”
“Today sucked! We had to get up early to see the Palace of Versailles. It was a boring tour.”
“We went to a fast food place called Burger Quick. I only got a soda (6 francs) but the hamburgers I saw were gross! They were so rare!”
“In Venice we went on the most boringest walking tour ever! I was so tired I tried to sleep as I walked.”
I imagine my dusty travel journal being found a hundred years from now by my great-great-grandchildren in an attic somewhere. They would flip through the pages and marvel at the indecipherable writing. Thinking maybe it’s cuneiform or ancient Sanskrit, they take it to an antique dealer to see if it’s worth anything. Maybe even pay to have the cursive “translated” to see what profound insights were captured so painstakingly by hand. I imagine the translator gently revealing the contents to them.
“Well, she talks a lot about long bus rides, gross foreign food, and having to wake up too early for boring tours of churches and palaces. But, you know, things were hard back in the 20th century.”
I might not have had a big interest in art, culture, food, or history during that high school trip, but it did definitely awakened my curiosity about the world and gave me insight into how people in other countries lived. It even opened my mind to the world of politics a bit. In Italy, for example, I saw political graffiti, some of it anti-American, spray painted in English as our bus drove through the busy Roman streets. One night after dinner we strolled through St. Peter’s Square in Vatican City and came across a candle-holding procession of people. Our guide told us that they were protesting the Pope’s election of a man who was believed to be an ex Nazi war criminal. I filed these and other important learnings away in the back of my teenage brain since the highlight of that particular evening (according to my journal) was hanging out on the steps of a church near our hotel, listening to a portable radio and dancing around until our curfew came.
In my first Paris article, I talked about all of the funny mistakes I made on my first trips to Europe, such as washing my underwear and socks in a bidet in my Paris hotel room because I thought it was just another sink. Well, the faux pas streak continued a week later in Rome when I again used the sink to wash my shirts and shorts (a real one this time, not a bidet). I decided to hang them to dry over the railing of my partial balcony, which faced a busy Roman street. When I came back hours later, my clothes were hanging in various spots around the room, still wet. A chaperone soon told us that hanging clothes outdoors so close to the Vatican was forbidden and not to do it. My not-so-bright idea didn’t sit well with housekeeping, nor the papacy, apparently. Who knows though, I bet when no one’s looking, the Pope puts his big pointy hat on his window ledge every once in a while to air it out.
I grew up on the East Coast of the United States, so to me “old” was something that was built a few hundred years ago, not thousands like you see in Rome. My hometown of Bristol, Pennsylvania, was founded in 1681. That’s pretty old for a town in the United States, though it’s certainly not the oldest. For comparison, Philadelphia traces its roots back to 1682, New York City to 1624, and Boston to 1630. St. Augustine, Florida, has them all beat, though, having been continuously inhabited since 1565. Of course, if you head to the Southwest, you’ll find even older places that native Americans built.
One of my favorite places to eat in Bristol is the King George II Inn & Tavern, which is the oldest continuously operating inn in the country. I always thought it was cool that some of our founding fathers came through its doors, including a young George Washington, John Adams, and James Madison. Even France’s Marquis de Lafayette ate there, probably munching on an early variation of a burger and French fries (well, to him it would just be “fries,” I guess). That early fascination is probably why I tend to seek out pubs and restaurants that are considered “the oldest” in the cities I visit, and why I love to stay at historic hotels.
I remember the first time I encountered something much, much older and how it made my head spin with awe. I was working temporarily in London and took a day trip to Warwick Castle one weekend. At 23, I still wasn’t much into history, but since we did a lot of date memorizing in history classes, I remembered distinctly that in 1066 that famous William guy did his conquering thing and became King of England.
While walking around the grounds of the castle he had built, I became fixated on the dirt path I was following, imagining how he might have walked this same dusty path. I could literally be walking in William the Conqueror’s footsteps, I thought excitedly. History really came to life for me at that moment. If only teleportation were a thing, field trips for World History class would be way more interesting.
It’s even more amazing when something so old is still in use. Once when I was in Adana, Turkey, in the late ’90s, my husband and I were in a cab sitting in rush hour traffic and were amazed when the driver told us that the stone bridge we were stuck on was built by the Romans in the 2nd century. Imagine a structure surviving nearly 2,000 years intact possibly being taken down by a distracted driver on their cell phone or fumbling with the radio. I was happy to read years later that they banned cars on it in 2007, and now it’s open only to foot traffic.
The Romans sure knew how to build things to last. The Colosseum would be completely intact today if it wasn’t for earthquakes and people in the Middle Ages pillaging its stone blocks to use for other buildings. Then there’s the old Appian Way. I can’t wait to walk along what’s considered the oldest road in the world (that’s still visible). That expression — “All roads lead to Rome”? Well, this road is the mother of them all. It’s so old, some of the stones still have grooves in them from chariot wheels (and we think potholes are bad). I’m sure I’ll have a time-travel mind melt when I imagine myself walking in the footsteps of historical heavyweights such as Julius Caesar and Spartacus. Though not literally: Caesar’s feet probably never had to touch the ground, being a conquering dictator and all, and well, poor Spartacus was crucified on the old Appian Way along with thousands of other rebellious gladiators.
Starting in late May, I’ll be trying to live like a local while staying at an apartment in the Monteverde neighborhood, just south of Trastevere. It’s about an hour walk from my place to the Colosseum, so I definitely hope to be living away from the tourist crowds, especially since this is a Jubilee year for the Catholic Church, which happens only once every 25 years. There’s no metro stop on my side of the river, but there are buses, trams, and of course my two feet. I’ll need to get in as many steps as I can if I’m going to eat all of the things on my checklist.
I need to redeem my teenage self’s dislike of the one pizza experience I had in Rome, so there will be lots of pizza tasting of all shapes and sizes. I’m not really into meat toppings, so I’ll probably just do plain, but there are some interesting veggies to try on pizza like radicchio, zucchini flowers, and squash blossoms. And of course there’s the pasta. I learned that there are four classics I have to try in Rome: Gricia (ancient), Amatriciana, Carbonara, and Cacio e Pepe. I’m not sure if I’ll work up the courage to try the specialty dishes made with offal (intestines, stomach lining, etc.). Though I’m willing to try meatballs made with cow tail (oxtail) and the famous Saltimbocca alla Romana (veal). There’s also a fancy bologna-like lunchmeat called mortadella that looks interesting.
I’ll also of course make time to do some sightseeing when I’m not working. So much time has passed since my last visit to Rome there’s even been a new exciting discovery. In my teenage travel journal, I wrote that I had visited the Forum ruins where our tour guide Ned told us Julius Caesar was assassinated. But turns out that was wrong. Excavations in 2012 uncovered markings by Caesar’s successor Augustus where he designated the exact spot. Turns out, it happened in the Curia di Pompey, a meeting place within the Pompey Theater complex that the Senators were using while the Senate House was being renovated. In 2023 a raised walkway was built over the excavation site so that visitors could get a closer look.
I’m sure I’ll have many moments where I try to imagine myself living among the ancient Romans. Like Russell Crowe’s character Maximus did in the Gladiator movie, I like to run my hands along tall grasses and plant leaves within my reach. It’s something I do no matter where I am walking, but in a place with lots of history, it helps me to feel connected to the people who were there centuries before me. It’s the same with touching walls, trees, and stones (when it’s allowed). Though my hands won’t be going anywhere near the stone latrine seats of the ancient communal bathrooms that I hope to see when touring the nearby ruins of Ostia Antica. I don’t need to imagine that part of ancient Roman life.
I am, however, open to the idea of using a bidet. In a kind of weird, come-full-circle plot twist, the apartment I’m renting has a bathroom with a bidet right next to the toilet. The place does have a washer and dryer, so don’t worry — my underwear and socks will be properly laundered this time.
Eventually, I plan to document here on Medium how it all went. Until then, follow my stories and posts on Instagram (@pammypez).

Hey there, fellow history enthusiasts! Today, I want to take you on a journey through time and explore the forgotten history of one of the most legendary cities in the world – Rome. So grab a drink, sit back, and let's dive right in!
When you think of Rome, you probably envision grand architecture, gladiators, and legendary rulers like Julius Caesar. But did you know that Rome's history stretches far beyond the commonly known spectacular ruins? It's time to unveil some fascinating forgotten secrets!
To start, let's talk about the early beginnings of Rome. It all began as a small village on the banks of the Tiber River in the 8th century B.C. As I'm sure you can imagine, it's come a long way since then!
One of the most significant periods in Roman history was the establishment of the Roman Republic. It was a time of ambitious politicians, mighty generals, and the birth of true democracy. The Romans were all about the law and order, and they did it with style!
Speaking of style, let's not forget about the lesser-known side of Rome – the fashion! Romans were trendsetters of their time, known for their luxurious clothing, intricate jewelry, and even fashionable footwear.
Of course, we can't talk about Rome without mentioning the iconic Colosseum. This incredible structure served as a…

I don’t know many people who don’t love Italian food.
The pizza. The pasta. And the produce — just ask anyone who has visited an Italian market to describe what they saw there and watch them get all misty-eyed about bitter greens and parmesan. It’s a sight to see — both the markets and people’s reactions to them.
I recently took my fourth trip to Rome. This is a city that grabbed me by the stomach during my first visit in 2008 and has never let go.
It sounds like a cliché but Romans know how to eat and drink very well. It’s what keeps me coming back more than anything else. You can lead this horse to the Colosseum or the Vatican if you must, but I will only drink from the well of Roman food and drink culture.
30,000 steps a day around the city gave me ample time to reflect on how Rome just gets food and drink right. It’s a pleasure here, not a chore. It’s a way of life, not an inconvenience.
And we could learn a thing or two from that.
Start the day in a café, those quintessential third spaces Italy holds so dear.

In the annals of Roman history, certain names echo with legendary resonance: Caesar, Augustus, Nero. Yet, there are emperors whose legacies, though significant, shimmer less vividly in the collective memory. Among these, Lucius Verus (130–169 AD) stands as a compelling figure, whose reign alongside Marcus Aurelius marked a period of both prosperity and profound challenges for the Roman Empire.
The Path to Power
Lucius Verus’ path to the imperial throne was both unique and a reflection of the complex adoption practices among Roman elites. Born Lucius Ceionius Commodus, his rise to prominence came through a series of strategic adoptions orchestrated by Hadrian to ensure a smooth succession. Hadrian first adopted Antoninus Pius on the condition that Antoninus would subsequently adopt both Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Ceionius Commodus (the future Lucius Verus). This series of adoptions was aimed at securing a stable and capable line of succession.
Upon Hadrian’s death, Antoninus Pius became emperor, and Lucius Verus, alongside Marcus Aurelius, was groomed for future leadership. The true moment of Lucius Verus’ accession began when Antoninus Pius died in 161 AD. In a historic move, Marcus Aurelius, immediately upon becoming emperor, insisted on sharing power with Lucius Verus, thereby elevating him to the status of co-emperor. This decision was groundbreaking, marking the first time in Roman history that the empire was officially ruled by two emperors simultaneously. The co-emperorship was a testament to their close relationship and Marcus Aurelius’ desire for a balanced and shared rule.
Military Endeavors
Lucius Verus’ reign was significantly shaped by his military campaigns, particularly in the East. The Parthian War (161–166 AD) stands out as the most notable. Initially, Verus was criticized for his seemingly luxurious lifestyle in Antioch, away from the front lines. However, under his nominal command, Roman forces, led by capable generals such as Avidius Cassius, achieved significant victories, including the capture of the Parthian capital, Ctesiphon, in 165 AD. These successes expanded Roman influence in the East and brought substantial booty back to Rome, but they also inadvertently introduced a devastating plague that would afflict the empire for years.
Coinage and Public Image
The coinage of Lucius Verus, like that of many Roman emperors, served as a vital tool for propaganda and the projection of imperial authority. His coins frequently depicted themes of victory and divine favor, reinforcing his and Marcus Aurelius’ status as protectors and benefactors of the empire. The imagery on these coins, ranging from representations of conquered territories to symbols of military success, played a crucial role in shaping public perception of his reign.
Architectural Contributions and Public Works
Although Lucius Verus’ rule is less noted for monumental architecture than that of his co-emperor Marcus Aurelius, his contributions to Rome’s urban landscape were not insignificant. He and Marcus Aurelius jointly dedicated the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, transforming a personal monument into a public space of worship. Additionally, the triumphal arches and other structures erected in their honor celebrated their military victories and served as enduring symbols of their joint rule.
Personal Life and Legacy
Verus’ personal life, marked by his marriage to Marcus Aurelius’ daughter Lucilla, was integral to the political and familial alliances that underpinned the stability of their co-emperorship. His untimely death in 169 AD, possibly due to the plague that followed the Parthian campaign, brought an end to this unique period of dual rule. In the aftermath, Marcus Aurelius continued to govern alone, facing further military and social challenges without the partnership that had characterized their approach to leadership.
Lucius Verus’ reign, though overshadowed by that of his more philosophically inclined co-emperor, was a pivotal period in the history of the Roman Empire. His military successes bolstered Rome’s territorial and strategic standing, while his coinage and public works projects contributed to the civic and cultural life of the empire. Despite the brevity of his rule and the challenges that marred it, Verus’ legacy is a testament to the complexities and contradictions of imperial leadership in ancient Rome.
Conclusion
Lucius Verus, often overlooked in the shadow of Marcus Aurelius, was a figure of considerable importance in the Roman imperial pantheon. His unique position as co-emperor, his military accomplishments, and his role in the cultural and economic life of the empire offer valuable insights into the dynamics of Roman imperial rule and the challenges it faced. As we reflect on his legacy, we are reminded of the myriad ways in which power, politics, and personal ambition intersect in the annals of history, shaping the destinies of empires and their rulers.

Intro: This is Citations Needed with Nima Shirazi and Adam Johnson.
Nima: Welcome to the Citations Needed live show Beg-a-Thon. Citations Needed is, of course, a podcast on the media, power, PR, and the history of bullshit. As I said, this is one of our periodic Beg-a-Thons, our virtual live show fundraisers. And we’re so glad that you are joining us tonight. Thank you, everyone. I am Nima Shirazi.
Adam: I’m Adam Johnson.
Nima: It’s great to have you all here with us. Of course, you can follow the show on Twitter and Bluesky @citationspod, Facebook Citations Needed, and become a supporter of the show if you’re not already, and this is a Beg-a-Thon, so we obviously would really like you to become a supporter, through Patreon.com/CitationsNeededPodcast. All your support through Patreon is so incredibly appreciated as we are 100% listener funded.
Adam: Yes, and if you become a supporter on Patreon, which, again, is ostensibly the purpose of this Beg-a-Thon, in addition to delightful conversation, edifying everyone, you get access to over 160 News Briefs, show notes and more fun stuff, special episodes, little things we do here and there, live shows, live chats, etc. But most importantly, you get to put your head on the pillow at night and go to sleep knowing that you supported our humble podcast.
Nima: That’s right. And tonight, on Citations Needed, we will be talking about how Elon Musk and his MAGA incel army have appropriated the cultural imagery and aesthetics of Ancient Rome, while obviously neither knowing or understanding anything about the ancient world beyond what maybe they’ve seen in Gladiator or 300.
Adam: To just sort of orient the audience, Trump World, and now increasingly, Elon Musk is effectively the co-vice president, are obsessed with evoking Roman symbols, iconography, to advance a fascist political agenda. I think it’s fair to use the F-word, fascist. We’re going to use that. I know some people dispute that, but I think I don’t really know what else to call it at this point. White nationalist, at the very least. And they present Rome and view Rome, either in meme format or explicitly, there’s even kind of a cottage industry of pseudo-intellectual scholars we can kind of get into as well who pander to these people, YouTubers, etc. They present it as a kind of the platonic ideal of a quote-unquote “Western civilization.” Everyone has their place. There’s a, you know, the kind of Nietzschean values of conquest and domination, how they view the world as being about, you know, rewarding the people with the most merit and the most honor, blah, blah, blah. And we covered this back in 2019 with today’s special guest. And there’s obviously been a lot of that, has gotten charged and heightened lately. And so we wanted to kind of bring her back also, because she has a wonderful book out that I have read. You should definitely read it too. It is excellent.
Nima: It is so good, and we’re going to be promoting it all night. So who are we talking about, Adam? We’re talking about our guest tonight, Dr. Sarah E. bond, Associate Professor in the Classics at the University of Iowa. Hey, Sarah, good to see you. Sarah joins us again after about five and a half years, she was on Episode 82, way back in July of 2019, in the before times, for our show, which was entitled “‘Western Civilization’ and White Supremacy: The Right-Wing Co-option of Antiquity.” So it is amazing to have you back. You, Sarah, are the author, as we said, of the new book Strike: Labor, Unions, and Resistance in the Roman Empire, which is out now from Yale University Press. I’m so excited to get to our conversation with you, Sarah.
But before we do that, we just want to note why we’re doing this tonight, this Beg-a-Thon, this kind of fundraiser that we do periodically. Citations Needed takes a team to make and it takes a ton of work to do each episode. Not many shows do the research that we do at the pace we do it, and since we started the show back in July of 2017, we’ve released well over 200 episodes, more than 160 News Briefs. We’ve welcomed more than 300 guests. We love doing this. We are grateful for each and every listener, every download, every like, every share, tens of thousands of you wonderful people listen to the show every week, and we cannot thank you enough for that. It is amazing. But only a tiny fraction of you actually support the show and our team through Patreon, which is the way that we’re able to keep doing this. And so that is why we are holding this Beg-a-Thon, as we call it, tonight.
Adam: So that was the good cop. I’m gonna do the bad cop. Listen, you mooches. No, I’m just kidding. I’m not gonna neg you, except to say that we are 100% user supported. We get no corporate sponsorships. We get no foundations. I’ll spare you the sanctimonious spiel, but you get the general idea. So if you do listen and you do like it, it actually is very, very helpful if you actually do support it, because, you know, there’s just not a lot of, of the people who listen, just not a high percentage do, and listen consistently. And yes, we have the data, and we’ve geolocated you. We know who you are.
Nima: [Laughs] That’s right. So tonight, we’re asking, if you are able, to please go to our Patreon page. We’ll put the link up there, but it’s very easy to find. It’s Patreon.com/CitationsNeededPodcast. Go help us out there. All right, enough of this garbage. Adam, let’s get to the show.
Adam: Yeah. Let’s get to the show itself. So tonight we are focusing on, again, we are using as a framing device the popularity of our new South African co-president Elon Musk and his minions and his incel army, with Roman iconography and alleged history as a gateway to talk about what is a far richer, more interesting vision of Rome that you’ve written, this excellent book you’ve written, which we’ll get into. So we’re going to start with that hook, and then kind of get into what you wrote about, which is obviously meant to, in some ways, kind of be a counter to that cheesy narrative, which I’m sure we can talk about. So we’re just going to give a little bit of background, Nima.
Nima: Yeah, sure.
Adam: If you want to sort of take over that part, because I know you had the unfortunate task of gathering that background information unfortunately.
Nima: So you know this idea of fascistic elements, neo-Nazis, in the US, namely their collective, now chief avatar, effective President of the United States, Elon Musk, the richest man in the world. They’ve been adopting and co-opting and misunderstanding the aesthetics of Ancient Rome, kind of as a rule, but as a distinct part of their fascistic political project. And one of the most prominent examples of this occurred after Elon Musk himself did a very clear Sieg Heil gesture three times during the inauguration of Donald Trump in January of 2025. Now Musk’s ally, Andrea Stroppa, who lives in Italy and claims to have an advisory role in some of Musk’s companies, posited that’s Musk Sieg Heil was was merely a Roman salute. Stroppa wrote in a now-deleted Tweet, quote, “Roman Empire is back, starting from Roman salute.”
Adam: Now, this was far from the first time that Musk had cited Rome to justify his reactionary ideology and paranoid xenophobia and deeply, deeply unfunny jokes. The guy’s constitutionally incapable of being funny, which is quite a feat. At least Trump’s funny, I guess. Now our guest, Dr. Bond, wrote for the arts news and analysis site Hyperallergic, we’re sorry, we’re going to quote you back at you. It’s one of the ultimate sins of podcasting, but we’re going to do it. Quote,
Musk has a long history of referencing the Roman Empire. His brand of technocratic despotism and its social media iconography has roots in the work of 20th-century European fascists, who were themselves fixated on Ancient Rome. He has long been obsessed with the late Roman Republic dictator Sulla and in December even changed his X avatar to “Kekius Maximus” — a Romanized version of Pepe the Frog dressed in military garb similar to that of Maximus in the film Gladiator (2000). Like Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, the billionaire has frequently expressed admiration for the Roman Empire, posting AI pictures of himself cosplaying as a Roman soldier…
God, that’s sad. You didn’t write that, that’s me, sorry.
…and cooking up theories about why Ancient Rome fell (answer: severe decline in birth rate). He thinks about it every day.
End quote. So let’s begin. I want to sort of bring in Sarah here.
Nima: Yeah, let’s do it.
Adam: We’ve set the table. Before we get into the questions about the actual book you wrote, forgive us, I want you to sort of comment on this piece, what you think superficially people find attractive. I know the elements are kind of obvious, but I want you to kind of dive into why you wrote this piece, why you think it’s important to engage as a historian of Rome with this seemingly popular current on the Nazi, or Nazi-adjacent Right.
Sarah E. Bond: Right, so the piece that I wrote for Hyperallergic, I wrote with Stephanie Wong, who is also a professor of history. She just graduated from Brown. And we write a lot together, because I think that our perspectives are very aligned, and we’re good at writing together, but we had been for years now, because we’ve been, gosh, we’ve been writing and collaborating for six years together, and so we decided that we were going to just collect all the things that he said since about 2020, about Ancient Rome, because I have just a gigantic digital folder of references to Ancient Rome that politicians have made over the years. And many of us who do a lot of reception history, which is just a fancy word for saying how things are repackaged and reused from the ancient world. We had been keeping track of it, and we had written an article together for MSNBC a few years, let’s see, a year and a half ago, on that meme about why people think about the Roman Empire.
And the person that Elon Musk thinks about the most seems to be Sulla, who was a dictator in the middle and early first century BCE. And Sulla eventually does give up power and is not assassinated. He eventually gives it up and retires and hands what’s left of the Republic over to Crassus and Cicero, I’m sorry, Crassus and Pompey, essentially, as the next consoles. But he’s obsessed with Sulla, and that really set off alarm bells in my head, because Sulla wiped out all of his political enemies by the hundreds. And this is something called the proscriptions, and Julius Caesar refuses to do the proscriptions when he becomes dictātor, or dictator, but it is picked back up again as a practice by Octavian Augustus. And so this idea that you can just wipe out all of your enemies and kill them and give people free rein to kill them is something that he’s idealizing, and it seems to be that he’s fixating a lot on. And especially with the purge of the federal government that’s been going on for the past, guys, can you believe that Trump has been president for a month, exactly, almost? It feels like it’s been five years.
Nima: It feels like it’s been 2,000 years.
Sarah E. Bond: It has been four weeks of nonstop layoffs and nonstop purging of the federal government. And I don’t think that’s the same in any way as killing people via the proscriptions, but I do think that Elon Musk likes to make people vulnerable to attack.
Adam: Yeah. Unless you fly a plane. Or rather fly on a plane, I should say.
Sarah E. Bond: I should just say with Elon Musk that we’re talking about aesthetics and idealizing. But I just want to point out something really huge here that was covered by Maya Pontone on Hyperallergic as well, with background from many researchers, myself included, is that Elon Musk has started to give money specifically to archeological projects and projects focused on the ancient world, and that there is a pipeline that is being created from the world of classics into, directly, the world of Elon Musk and this DOGE palace that he’s creating for himself, that we can’t just say that this is a fantasy that he’s playing out, that he gave over $2 million to the Vesuvius Challenge, which decoded a small amount of the papyri from Herculaneum and gave prize money to a young AI engineer named Luke Farritor. And Luke Farritor now works with DOGE and was one of the six engineers that originally went in with Musk a few weeks ago. So it’s not as though we can say, in the world of classics, Oh, we’re just, you know, he idealizes us, but we’re mutually exclusive. We’re in a bubble out here. What can we do about it? It’s like, No, we have people who are taking the money of Musk, the Vesuvius Challenge, as well as, there’s another called the AIRC in Rome, who has also taken money from Musk, and so he’s funding cultural heritage and AI as a way of accessing people that are involved with the ancient world. And you know, it matters who we take money from. It very much matters.
Adam: There’s a risk there, because, again, he did this. He’s obviously done this for years with STEM, where he throws so much money around that your favorite science channel will do these sycophantic reports on him. Science media will do sycophantic reports on him. They’ll get an interview with him and gush over him, even this is, like, sort of post-overt Nazi stuff. And so, yeah, I mean, when you have, again, $400 billion in debt worth, obviously, it’s not totally liquid, but it’s, you know, he could, he could take a loan against it anytime he wants. And, you know, controlling the past is, is because not to be too sort of, you know, I don’t want to be too overly precious–
Nima: You can rage against the machine. It’s okay.
Adam: Well. I mean, you know, He who controls the present controls the past. He who controls the past controls the future. I do think it matters, because then we’re going to be curated. It’s going to be curated, presented in a way that flatters his ideological dispositions.
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, and we’re already seeing that. We have Trump firing the archivist of the United States after she had already deleted and moved around parts of an exhibit that was within the National Archives. And he still fired her. But she had gone in and edited parts of history that were negative, right? And so the presentation of history and the people that are in control of it is what he wants access to, and he wants good press for sure, and he’s trying to buy himself a connection to antiquity in order to conjure legitimacy that we’ve already seen. This is the same MO that Mussolini took to legitimize his power and his rise within fascist Italy.
Adam: He’s basically–
Sarah E. Bond: All you have to do, yeah, you just rebuild the Ara Pacis, right? Rebuild the Res Gestae Divi Augusti, which is exactly what Mussolini does, is invest so many thousands and millions of dollars into the rebuilding of the Roman Forum and the rebuilding of the Roman senate house. This is a playbook we’ve already seen before, because he has no legitimate status within the federal government. So he’s clinging to what he perceives as the only legitimacy that he cares about, which is power from the ancient world.
Nima: Talking about preserving the past and also, you know, as we’re going to get into kind of who is allowed to control our understanding of the past. And we’re going to get into this, this idea of, you know, whether from imperial historians kind of empowered and sponsored to tell the official history of Rome, to this kind of idea of history from below, which you tell through your work, Sarah. I’d love to kind of discuss the overall thesis of your book, which really shows how class conflict and the organized withholding of labor was a consistent feature of Roman life, as were slave revolts, military strikes, other forms of resistance, much of which has been erased or at least reduced to individual stories of heroism in kind of broader ancient, historical retellings, and certainly in the popular mind. How those who don’t study this so closely kind of understand the ancient world, and then certainly Ancient Rome. So what compelled you to write this new book Strike, and what broad image of Rome, both in our pop culture and in kind of more historical consensus, were you attempting to illuminate and edify for us?
Sarah E. Bond: I was going back and re-reading an economic history of Rome from a guy named Tenney Frank, and he was a racist from the turn of the 20th century, like into the 20th century. And, I think it’s 1920, he writes an economic history of Rome, and he thinks that strikes cannot happen because of the number of enslaved people within the Roman Empire. And we do know that within the Italic peninsula, for instance, up to 25% of the population, especially during the the period of the High Roman Empire, so the first two centuries CE, have a large number of enslaved people. And even prior to that, there was a large number. And so he thought that because there were enslaved people, there could never be strikes, because every time you would have artisans going on strike, why wouldn’t you just replace them with other enslaved persons? And that really discounted the professionalization of enslaved people as potters, as weavers, as textile workers, as carpenters, as tavern workers and owners. And his belief that there weren’t strikes kind of infuriated me, and led me to read more about what people thought about strikes, about withholding labor, and what it might have been called in the ancient world.
And it was surprising to me that there just had been so little written on collective action and the withholding of labor in the ancient world, because many people, both Marxists and non-Marxists, had thought that there really weren’t a lot of instances of it. And so in the 19th century, Marx and Engels had believed that the first strikes ever had been the plebeians during what we call the Struggle of the Orders, which really starts in 495 BCE. And if we’re trying to place that, that’s about 15 years after the start of the Roman Republic. So 509, the Roman Republic starts. The last king of Rome is ousted, and we have the start of something we call the res publica, or the republic. And a few years after that, we have the plebeians and the patricians fighting against each other because the patricians are extremely wealthy and they have a lot of power, but also they have a lot of both soft and hard power, in that they monopolize all the magistracies, the consulship, the pontifical colleges, all of the major magistracies, the patricians are, are really dominating.
And so I looked at the Struggle of the Orders, but thought to myself, I think there has to be many more instances of this happening. And so starting to look through things that really didn’t make it into the traditional literary historical record, like papyri and inscriptions, really was the access point to find out that, especially in the Greek world, and going all the way back to the Egyptian world, this had been happening for many thousands of years. And so I started tracing backwards and forwards and finding that there were a lot more instances, because a strike by any other name is still a strike. And so even though the word is not coined until the 18th century in England, because it’s referring to the striking of the top sails of merchant ships in the 18th century, even though that word does not exist in Ancient Rome, that you still have the withholding of labor and the boycotting of certain assigned things like the military levy through calling it a secessio, where we get, for instance, the word secession from. But then when you look in the Greek papyri, they’re calling it an anachoresis, which just means a withdrawal. And for many hundreds and thousands of years, we’ve had workers, especially in Egypt, refusing to work unless they were given emmer and wheat and the right amount of staples to keep working. Sometimes they would just go sit in the back of a temple.
And so for me, it was saying modern people think that strikes are a development of the progressive modern Western civilization post-Industrial Revolution, and as is my wont, I usually like to say to most things, Well, that sounds like bullshit, that that we have created this idea of progressive structure to get to the period that we are now, even though it does not feel that we are in a progressive moment in the least, and to try and unpack why we think that unions and strikes and labor withdrawals, that all of these things are a much more modern development in order to really make us feel a little bit more successful as individuals. And I think we just have to give more credit to the Romans.
Nima: Yeah, I love the idea that, like, a strike by any other name is still a strike that, even if they don’t use that term, because, you know, you actually start your book by talking about how the term was coined, the striking of sails in a British port. But then going back to Deir el-Medina, the strike in Egypt, and then kind of tracing that up through history is just, I think, really, really fascinating to see how, in a world that is built on the on the backs of laborers, the power that is held through withholding labor, has been recognized, not just, you know, since the Industrial Revolution, but you know, for thousands and thousands of years.
Adam: On some level, the idea that people around the world would withhold labor is, it does seem sort of self-evidently obvious, because what other leverage do you have as a laborer? And 99% of humans throughout history have been laborers, typically exploited in any kind of semi-developed sense that would be exploited by some rich asshole who lived on the hill. It doesn’t. It’s not a huge leap to say that this is a kind of universal, that there’s an evolutionary convergence to land on some form of strike, right? And what you argue is that while that is true, there was also more sophisticated antecedents that made these more coordinated, more and more sophisticated than we maybe thought.
And one of the things we talk about is these associations, which were both kind of, which were not these kind of perfect Marxist organizations, in the sense that they were oftentimes kind of business trade groups. They didn’t fit along these kind of perfectly, you know, Maoist lines, but in many ways they what you do argue is that they could be instrumentalized to carry out something we would recognize as a labor strike, and that because of the way history is written, you specifically talk about Levy and others, because of the inherently elite nature of reading and writing and how history is created, the first draft, second draft, third draft, that those stories get flattened or obscured.
And you even have this great section, I won’t read it back to you, because I’d like you to talk about it, about the ways in which mob violence is flattened. When you say that oftentimes, as a class dimension, that is fairly obvious, but in the history books, it’s kind of written off as just mob violence. And you even draw some parallels to current examples, when mass unrest is sort of stripped of its ideology, which I thought was a really fascinating, really interesting part of the book. Can you talk about the ways in which–
Nima: Cicero was just doing what the New York Times does now.
Adam: Well, yeah, by the way, I found out he did, The the shrimp store called and they’re running out of you, The jerk store called, where he would, I didn’t realize this until I read Mary Beard’s book, that he would write what he said on the Senate floor later on, which seems like cheating. And then people presented it as like, He’s this great orator, and it’s like, You just got to go back and rewrite it. Anyway. Talk, if you could, about the these associations, how they provided the kind of framework to make a more sophisticated form of labor unrest, and if you could also talk about the ways in which historians, for obvious reasons, who were wealthy or patrician or what have you, decided to kind of say, Oh, that was just mindless, ideology-free violence.
Sarah E. Bond: I think when we create homogenous groups, when we call everybody a mob, that’s already a pejorative, it’s already casting them into negative rhetoric. And the Romans are no different. They like to use very large, amalgamous nouns, a turba, a multitudo, that is to just say, a gigantic negative word for a crowd, right? And when you just say crowd, you aren’t allowing for organization, you aren’t allowing for hierarchy, you aren’t allowing for structure. And although we don’t get a ton of anatomies of crowds from the ancient world, we can see, especially in the late Republic, that a lot of groups that are coming together, what we call collegia, and that’s where we get the modern word college from. A collegium, in the singular, is just a group of people. In Roman law, you have to be three or more people to be considered a collegium. And we have about 3,200 inscriptions in papyri that give reference to these various groups that really grow in number in the early Hellenistic period forward.
So from the death of Alexander the Great forward, people increasingly are creating groups for various reasons. So you could have a group that is focused on Dionysus, because who doesn’t want to get together and drink some wine and have a nice bacchanalia? But you could also form a group, if you were merchants or trades people living on the island of Delos, and you’re human traffickers, and you need to have a workflow, essentially, that moves people throughout the Mediterranean. You can move bread through it, in terms of wheat and flour, you may need to have a supply chain to give you precious jewels, pepper, cinnamon, lots of things that you might want to trade, or you might just be a carpenter and want to have other carpenters that you work with.
And so these collegia are proliferating, especially into the period of the Republic. Many of them don’t have enough money to meet in a proper schola, which is a clubhouse. And so lots of them do what many confraternities have always done, and that is meet in a public house, called a pub. And so you go to a tavern, the tavern keeper allows you to sit there and to congregate. And when we try and understand the movements within the late Republic, one of the things that I think is important to see is that these groups are coming together extremely quickly, in a very organized manner, in order to hear public speeches called contiones. And so my question is, Okay, we have rhetoricians like Cicero, who’s calling them just a gigantic mob, but in reality, he’s giving us clues that say that they’re starting in a specific sector that artisans are known to live within, and that the tavern keepers are involved in it. And to me, trying to reconstruct the underlying structure is very important, because a lot of that gets erased in the name of marginalizing them. And marginalizing vocabulary is something that we’ve seen, especially since 2020. When you marginalize a crowd, we saw this even with Occupy Wall Street as well, is that, yes, Occupy Wall Street actually was quite organized, even though, yes, they were very against hierarchy and a lot of the traditional leadership structures, but we really see that it’s elite people who tend to call crowds mobs.
So whether it’s Black Lives Matter, whether it’s any other social movement, it deprives them and really robs them of their peaceful protest and of their organization. And I think that this is something that always has happened, is that really wealthy people, if you want to completely marginalize a movement, you just simply call them a mob. And that just is an unjust way to label many groups, not all groups, but I think a lot of groups have been robbed of their legitimacy by being called a mob, because immediately you think of violence and criminality and also anti-patriotism, and that’s something that with unions, for instance, if we go back to Garfield, President Garfield, not the cat. I mean, I like the cat, too.
Adam: No relation.
Sarah E. Bond: No, no relation. President Garfield, he hated unions, and he thought they were unpatriotic, and he thought of them as just individuals who incited mob violence. And so it’s not hard to trace and to track down the ways in which we marginalize groups of people, individually, but also groups that are coming together in order to fight for their rights.
Nima: But it’s not just in rhetoric, right, Sarah? I mean, because also then the discourse and the language and the denigration also turns into policy or legislation, and we see that now, you know, with anti-protest legislation across the country, whether that is, you know, from campus protests against genocide in Palestine or, you know, long before, anti-assembly legislation. But you also talked about this in your book Strike, about how the elites and the wealthy call associations or call, you know, regular people getting together, not only a mob, but then they kind of legislate against it. Talk about where that came from, and some of the parallels there.
Sarah E. Bond: I think we’re all thinking about anti-assembly legislation, especially since October 7, and thinking about groups coming together and protesting against the treatment of Palestinians especially. I visited the groups that were on the quad at the University of Chicago. We had a very small group at the University of Iowa, for instance, and many campuses across the country were. Pushing them off of public property. Now, the University of Chicago is a private school. That’s a little bit different, but we even saw this at public schools that people were getting arrested, that they were not allowed to assemble, even when they were just peaceably in their tents and just sitting there.
So I think that we’ve been thinking about freedom of assembly and whether that is a civil right and to what extent it should be protected. And when we go back to the ancient world, we see that freedom of assembly was something that very wealthy elite people like senators and the emperor were very, very anxious about. And it’s not something that is new, that, especially for instance, Julius Caesar and Octavian moved to make legislation very soon into their periods of rule that say, Okay, well, you know, collegia, maybe they can, they can meet at certain times, but predominantly we’re going to have them disband unless they’re the oldest collegia that have ever been established, and if they have a public utility, right?
And this idea of the civic good that a collegium has to serve the civic good, it’s tying into this idea of patriotism, again, is that freedom of assembly is only extended if it is for the good of the res publica, but when you get into the Empire, the res publica does not really exist anymore. It’s a false reconstruction that Augustus has made, right? He calls it the reconstruction of the res publica, but come on, it’s an empire. It is the empire that he is building, and he is the imperator. And so what he’s really saying when he disbands collegia and when he begins to threaten freedom of assembly more and more, is that I don’t want myself threatened by this, and I don’t want any public discord that might turn into resistance against me.
And the smothering of resistance before it can really ever get a lot of steam is just something that is quite common within the Roman Empire. People think that they’re, Oh, you know, the Roman Empire was so good to live in that there was just no resistance, right? Like after Spartacus, we have, Oh, very little, except for maybe the Jewish Wars that are in Judea. And that’s just not true, because everyday resistance, the act of forming a union, the act of engaging in a labor strike, right, the act of pushing against this revoking of freedom of assembly, everyday resistance, is just as important as these gigantic rebellions. They don’t just formulate out of nothing. And so I think that freedom of assembly has always been revoked and questioned and placed as something unpatriotic, because those in power have always known that when people get together, they have more power collectively than they do apart, and that’s why the motto of the United States is E Pluribus Unum, one out of many. And right now, we’re seeing a shift to just the unum part, but not really the people as much a part of it. So that’s something that is really scary to see Trump tweet out, “LONG LIVE THE KING!” It was something that gave me chills, because I immediately thought of the late Roman Republic.
Adam: So I want to sort of back up here a little bit and sort of maybe circle back with what we talked about with your book, with the sort of more topical themes about the rightwing fascination with Rome. And it’s superficial, albeit superficial, which is, I mean, look. Rome as a sort of idea is the way we sort of perceive the West, right? You know, it wasn’t till the late ’90s that to graduate from Oxford, you had to know Latin. It is, it is the way in which academics and intellectuals and scientists talk to each other, up until, again, whatever, the 1800s. Rome, obviously, is kind of what we what, what is viewed as, as Europe, as a sort of, for want of a better term, white civilization, despite the fact that it, of course, wasn’t one in any meaningful sense. But that’s certainly how it’s been idealized as it’s gone through its various white supremacist historical laundromats throughout the decades. And so it kind of makes sense why people who are kind of adrift, or don’t really have any firm, who aren’t very firmly committed into any kind of ideology, would be drawn to it because of its proximity to, it’s sort of a more politically correct form of white nationalist sort of mythmaking.
And so, in some sense, does it make sense why a sort of mediocre, you know, internet-addled dope like Musk would would, again, superficially be into it. He sort of praised Mike Duncan’s podcast, much to Mike Duncan’s chagrin. It all kind of makes sense, because it is this sort of idealized, white, sort of heroic version of themselves and in a weird way, I know I mentioned her book before, but Mary beard’s book SPQR, at the very end, she has this line that’s clearly in dialogue with that, where she says, I get asked a lot, you know, basically been working on this book for 50 years, I get asked a lot, What do we have to learn from modern society in Rome? And I’m paraphrasing here, forgive me if I’m misrepresenting this. But she kind of says, Basically nothing. And I don’t think she meant that, like in a non-, in a sort of anti-intellectual way. I think she was, it appeared to be in the context it was written to be responding to these people constantly saying we’re at the end of the Roman Empire, because it’s so cliche, right? Isaac Newton said it. I mean, every 10 years we’re, you know, we’re in the end. Everyone likes to talk about the fall of the Roman Empire, because what are you criticizing? Homophobia, right? You sort of, you’re trafficking the idea of, we’re becoming effeminate, we’re becoming weak. Blah, blah, blah, the meme Strong Men Create Good Times, Good Times Create Weak Men.
Sarah E. Bond: A lot of immigration. They really like to harp on immigration.
Nima: That’s right. The barbarians are coming.
Sarah E. Bond: Right. The barbarians at the gates. Yes.
Adam: So if you could, if you would comment a bit about or rather, it’s a little bit open-ended, but I want you to talk about why you think that the mythology, the white supremacist mythology of Rome, appears to be increasing, but has kind of survived and what you think, to what extent do you feel like some, you know, I don’t want you to name names necessarily, but what extent pop history movies have really contributed to that, where they do have this very one-note kind of vision of what, not to sort of blame them for it necessarily, one-note vision of Rome?
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, I did review Gladiator, too. So we just, I mean, I reviewed it for Hyperallergic and I think a lot of the misconceptions about Rome are very entertaining. That when it goes on film, who doesn’t like watching the first Gladiator in the year 2000? And all of the things that are being picked up on and received, right as it’s being filmed at the end of the Clinton administration, is talking about, We can bring Rome back. We can bring the Republic back. Now that’s absolute bullshit, because Marcus Aurelius, in no way ever wants to bring back the Republic. There is no hint of evidence. He had always set Commodus as being the one that was going to be his successor. But this idea that the Republic could come back, that was a romantic idea of the year 2000 that then resurfaces this year with the latest Gladiator, 25 years later, really, 24 years later, coming to the surface, this idea that the Republic could come back. So I think that there are some people who really want to see a genuine resurfacing of proper governance, or some sort of governance that people influence in some way. And so I’m not saying that Gladiator II is completely innocuous, because there are a lot of things wrong with that movie, but they are entertaining. Whether there were sharks in the amphitheater or not, and there were not sharks in the amphitheater, sorry.
Adam: Aw, boo. Sarah! Let me live the lie.
Sarah E. Bond: You could fill the Colosseum with water. It was watertight. So that’s true, you can have a sea battle in the Colosseum, but there were not sharks.
Adam: They got a little greedy with the sharks. They got a little greedy.
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, the CGI was just too far. So there are innocuous things, I think, like sharks in the Colosseum, that I’m really fine with. It’s just that this love affair with the fall of Rome is this idea that, especially conservatives, but we also have liberals who have written horrendously facile op-eds about the fall of Rome as well, that they can be the prognosticators using history. So they’re not only making themselves look extremely cerebral and extremely knowledgeable about quote-unquote, “Western Civ,” they’re also telling the future, and that gives them a level of power within the public sphere, and what they perceive of as the intellectual community, that gives them some sort of currency that they’ve read Gibbon. Well, who hasn’t read Gibbon? There are a lot of people that have read Gibbon. He published a two-volume set in 1776, guys, okay? There are no spoilers here. Everybody kind of knows what Gibbon has said.
But Gibbon is also speaking about the late 18th century. Everybody who is writing history, including myself, is thinking about the time period that they are living in. And I just think that, going back to this idea of the fall of Rome, is not only regurgitating and recycling Gibbon, which it clearly is, but it’s trying to send out a message that I am the truth teller, so please put your trust in me, and that’s essentially what op-eds are supposed to do anyways, right? Like I’m an opinion writer, I have a thousand words, I’m going to sway you that what I’m telling you is significant. It’s just that they get the history so wrong, especially, I would say when it comes to talking about religion and talking about, also, immigration, and talking about what really brought down different component parts of Rome, because Rome doesn’t fall monolithically together as one. That we have fracturing, that we have going in different directions, that many areas like North Africa stay extremely strong up to the Vandal invasion and things like this. So I mean, it’s just this idea that they can read the tea leaves through their historical abilities. And it’s just very wrong.
Adam: Yeah, and I’m going to read here from the Nixon tapes. He was obsessed with this idea. He ranted about it a lot. Quote,
You ever see what happened, you know what happened to the Greeks? Homosexuality destroyed them. Aristotle was a homo, we all know that. So was Socrates… Do you know what happened to the Romans? The last six Roman emperors were fags.
He concludes by saying,
You see, homosexuality, dope, immorality in general, these are the enemies of strong societies. That’s why the communists and the left-wingers are pushing the stuff: they’re trying to destroy us.
To be fair, I do do that. He’s got me there. But this is, again, this is so cliche. This has been done a billion times. The idea that, so much of the Roman, and you know, people would say, generally, corruption is what they’re really kind of referencing. But really it’s this idea of, again, Musk is obsessed with this idea of feminization. Again, he’s into weird kind of Silicon Valley natalist cults. He’s apparently doing some kind of panspermia experiment to half of California right now. I guess he’s on his 13th kid. And so it’s like this, this idea of, again, immigration, lack of white fertility, homosexuality, is like they all, they want to see it in Rome in a way that, of course, is not there, but that, of course, doesn’t really matter.
Nima: Well, I think what’s interesting also is, is, you know, the obsession with the kind of emperor or or even patrician class from some of the wealthiest people on the planet kind of makes sense, right? There’s a corollary there. It’s not just Musk. Also Mark Zuckerberg names his kids after, you know, Roman emperors. There’s a whole thing, weird thing going on. But, Sarah, I’d love for you to talk about how, how it’s not just, you know, the wealthy that kind of see themselves as part of that tradition, and kind of wanting to bring that back, that kind of makes sense, right? Like the people in charge want to be like the people in charge, but it’s for the workers and the people who glom on to this aesthetic as well, who all see themselves as warriors, not as other kinds of workers, right? I mean, we’re seeing farmers in the United States right now gutted by the cuts that have just been made to USAID. You know, hit hardest. You know, American farmers. That is not the kind of imagination that people storming the Capitol, or people excited about, you know, stanning for Musk on Twitter, like, they’re not seeing themselves as the people. They’re seeing themselves as these kind of like delayed warriors with the, you know, with the helmets and the crest and the Gladius by their side. Like, you know, where do you think that kind of comes from and how, how is that shaped by how we understand history, which I think your book starts to really unpack, like, who the people really are, and how we hear their stories, the kind of people’s history, not only of Rome, but of ourselves.
Sarah E. Bond: I think the idea of the American Dream is that we can always pull ourselves up from our bootstraps and be Musk, I mean, to be the richest man in the world. A lot of people imagine that they are capable of that, and we know that a very small number of people are ever able to ascend from poverty into the very wealthy 1%. And Musk isn’t even somebody, I mean, he comes from a family of emerald mine owners in South Africa. Trump comes from money. These are all nepo babies, okay, but this idea of the American Dream is that if you work hard enough, you can ascend. But part of that also is this idea of masculinity that is inextricably linked to Roman soldiers. And so if we go back to January 6 and the storming of the Capitol, there were people with signs where Trump was dressed like Maximus. Maximus, again, is not a historical figure there. It’s not real. Russell Crowe is playing a fictional character. But they are imagining themselves to be the highest order of masculinity. And the visualization of that, the kind of allegory that we have assigned to masculinity is the Roman centurion. And so, you know, just yesterday, I was looking at the new picture of Odysseus that was released for Christopher Nolan’s new version of The Odyssey. I want to see it. I’m going to see it, right? But Matt Damon has a crested helmet on that is very much not exactly what would have been worn in the Trojan War, but it is a crested helmet that is kind of very much emblematic of later soldiers that that are fighting, because the Greek phalanx and Sparta, etc., also is a symbol of masculinity.
And so when you try and question those constructions, people get very upset, because especially white men, tend to idealize both Spartan soldiers and also Roman centurions and soldiers as their everyday lives, like, This is how I should go through life. And these are people that don’t quite realize that if they were transported back to the ancient world, the vast chances are that they would be an enslaved person or a farmer or perhaps an artisan or a potter that’s making ceramics, and many of those also fought as soldiers in the earlier period of The Republic, when we have citizen armies. Enslaved persons usually did not but they were incorporated into the military in other ways. But yeah, I really think that it’s, it’s tied up in aesthetics of masculinity.
And I love that Adam said earlier that this is history laundering instead of money laundering, because that’s just exactly what it is. All of the actual, real colors of history have bled out, right? They’ve faded. They’ve been laundered to death, and now it just doesn’t even look like it actually was. It is a meme, and that’s exactly how memetic things work, is just continue to be recycled until they don’t really resemble the past in any real way. So the book is, in large part, trying to bring back the voices of just regular enslaved peoples, freed people, that is to say people who are manumitted, which is also a large part of the population, and they may not seem as sexy as a centurion, but we have the ability to redefine what sexy is. And I think that merchants who form a collegium and go on strike or sexier to me than a centurion that is running into battle. But yeah, I think there’s many books that are incorporated into this and that have been written and will be written on the reception of Roman history and white supremacy, but I think it all comes down to this feeling that, that this is the ultimate, this is the epitome of what it means to be a man.
Nima: Right. I mean, it’s really interesting that you mentioned, you know, that Russell Crowe is, you know, just an actor. Maximus doesn’t, doesn’t really exist. And in your book, you note that actors actually may have been the first in Ancient Rome to form what could be deemed like a proto-union, right? So, like, again, who is the everyday person, who are the people that are really organizing? Who is afforded the protections? Is it the you know, emperors, or is it the artisans?
Adam: I don’t want to let you go without asking about the viral popularity from 2016, then 2019, then it was huge during COVID, of Marcus Aurelius meditations and like Stoicism as this kind of masculine ideal. Ryan Holiday is kind of a hack writer, wrote a book about it, has a podcast about it.
Sarah E. Bond: We call that Broicism, by the way.
Adam: Broicism, sorry, and this is, apparently, it was, it’s been all the rage, and there was a viral lecture on it that was very sort of rah-rah that went viral during COVID. Again, on some level, one can see I actually read it. It was beyond tedious. But I stuck it out. I definitely don’t meet the the platonic ideal of a Stoic. As those listening to the show may be aware, I sometimes complain. And so I want you, I want to ask a little bit about, again, the sort of cartoon version versus the kind of real version. And it mean, again, these book sales, these podcasts are popular, these TikToks are very popular. This is, this is legitimately popular, and this is the primary entry point into Roman history for a lot of people. So talk, if you could, about the rise of Broicism and how, I don’t know if you, if you engage with this with a lot of undergrads or whatever, and talk about where you see it happen.
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, I want to say, if you’re going to buy a translation of Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations, my professor, whose name is Gregory Hays, I believe, wrote the best translation. So if we’re going to give actual money to anybody for buying Stoicism, and please don’t do those Instagrams that are like Stoicism Every Day, I’m going to send Stoicism and witticisms to your inbox, which half the time they’re fake. They’re fake quotes from Seneca. They’re fake quotes from Cicero. They’re fake quotes from Marcus Aurelius, etc. In any case, translations, who you choose to translate your words are extremely important. So yes, pick your translator carefully, number one. Number two, I think that if we think about technocrats and why this philosophy is extremely alluring to them, we can think about the fact that when you are a Stoic, you have to be happy with your lot in life, and it really behooves technocrats to have coders, to have people that are working within their companies, have a philosophy where they come to work and they’re like, You know, Gosh, darn. I’m just happy to be here. I’m going to be the best coder that I could be, right? And when we read things like Epictetus, then we think, Oh, I will be the best enslaved person that I could possibly be. But let’s face it, when you write the Meditations as Marcus Aurelius, and you say, I’m happy with my lot in life, well, you fucking should be. You are the emperor! You are the emperor! And so Elon Musk adopting Stoicism, which he really is not a Stoic in any stretch of the imagination.
Adam: No, I don’t think Stoics would post 50 tweets a day. Yeah.
Sarah E. Bond: No, no, no. This is not a man that I associate with Stoicism. But many technocrats within the area of the Silicon Valley have begun to glom on to this idea, because it is an opiate of the masses, essentially, as a philosophy. If everybody actually adopted it, then you would have people who aren’t trying to buck the system, that they are not trying to rebel, that they are not trying to modify the system in any way. They are trying individually to work internally on being the best person that they can be, but to reinforce the social hierarchy that already exists. I mean, this is not about transforming the society. It’s about reinforcing the status quo. And right now, the amount of social inequality that we have very much benefits extremely wealthy people. These are just wealthy people that want to maintain their wealth to an even higher degree, and Stoicism is a philosophy that supports their thesis, which is, I am awesome and have a lot of money that I wish to keep. And so they’ve only adopted the philosophy post-thesis.
Nima: And everyone else needs to be cool with that, too.
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, get with it! Come on, guys! This is part of the world that we live in, so just pacify yourself. Go forward and come to the office. Do not stay at home and do not work from home. We want you in an office. We want you doing the tasks that we are asking you to do. And please don’t question it, because questioning leads to disruption, and they don’t want disruption. They simply want to rule. And so yeah, I think Stoicism as a philosophy is very attractive to them and also to people who would like to be wealthy. And as we’ve already kind of talked about, this idea of the American Dream makes people believe that they, too, could be this technocrat in the future. So get with it. But yeah, I don’t think it’s very, I’m much more Epicurean. I know you could probably guess that.
Adam: Yeah. We did a whole episode on the kind of David Goggins, self-help, Tiktok world and again, on some some level, I’m sympathetic, because if there is a drudgery in your job, which, again, I know, I’m sure all of us have here had a drudgery job, you have to hold on to something to sort of make it make sense. But again, there’s a reason why your boss wants you to read Marcus Aurelius, and rather than a union organizer, he’s like, Wait. It’s basically the Mike Rowe sweat pledge. So I want to ask one more question before we go, because we’d be remiss if we didn’t talk about the GOAT, Spartacus, and the Servile Wars and obviously, revolts by enslaved people in general, which, of course, there was quite a few of them. Can we talk a little bit about because again, that would be like the sort of entry point into a discussion about labor that is broadly popular, you know, Kirk Douglas with his shirt off.
Nima: Tony Curtis.
Adam: Sorry, with all due respect to Tony Curtis. Talk about that, the sort of popularity of that narrative, again, it’s reduced to this kind of heroic narrative. But like, where did that, where was that oriented into this broader associations framework, and how people kind of mimic these structures, and what lessons can be drawn from that that are not this kind of cartoon, you know, Marcus Aurelius sitting here telling you how to, you know, how to eat shit and suck it up?
Sarah E. Bond: Well, I think Spartacus as a folk hero does not really gain a lot of steam until around the period of the French Revolution and a little bit before. So in terms of his revival, up until that point, people knew who Spartacus was, of course, he is written about by people like Appian and Plutarch, etc. That we have three Servile Wars. The first one is in Sicily in the end of the second century BCE, then we have another one that formulates out of Sicily a few years later. Spartacus himself is a few decades after that, and he’s not on Sicily. He is breaking out of a gladiatorial school in the area of Southern Italy, and Spartacus is seen by the contemporary sources and the sources that are not long thereafter as a rebel and a rabble-rouser. And of course, they’re not going on strike. They fully want freedom and never to come back to their jobs again. They do not want to return to being gladiators, so they’re not leveraging their labor in any way. They want to go free. And my belief is that they really should have, when they got towards the Alps, to continue going, but they circle back and they come back into the Italic peninsula, and I always want to yell like, Keep going, Spartacus! Keep going! But he’s not a hero in his own day. He may have been with enslaved persons. We don’t have a lot of their narratives or reactions to him, but during the period of the French Revolution, into later political campaigns in the 18th and then 19th and then 20th century, Spartacus gains more and more as a folk hero of freedom and rebellion against tyranny, whether it was in Prussia, where he was extremely popular. He became very popular in France and in the United States, and especially during the Haitian Revolution, where Toussaint Louverture takes the name of Black Spartacus. He’s given that name, but he is seen as, you know, this Haitian revolutionary leading enslaved persons to fight against enslavement within the island of Haiti, right? So all of these things build Spartacus’s hero worship, but the movie in 1960 really is what does it to the highest degree,
Adam: Written by a communist. No shocker there. Written by Dalton Trumbo.
Sarah E. Bond: Exactly. And it’s during the period of the blacklist. You know, they’re blacklisting communists after McCarthyism. That Spartacus is really about fighting against The Man. And I see Spartacus absolutely as the GOAT and a hero that should be celebrated. But we have to also remember that he was working within a gladiatorial troupe, and that gladiatorial troupe lives within the gladiatorial school, and they coordinate together. Spartacus has lieutenants that he works with, but he has a group of people that are very close to him that mobilize in a very planned rebellion in the gladiatorial school. They go to the kitchen, and they grab utensils and knives and break out of the gladiatorial school. And then, as they are moving through Italy, whether to Vesuvius, or whether going north, etc, they are gaining more and more enslaved persons in a very organized manner, up to about 100,000 people.
And this is during a period when Roman slavery had been growing so quickly. Over the past 200 years, Roman slavery had expanded to a level that that had never seen before, and the number of enslaved people was so high within the Italic peninsula. So, I mean, I think Spartacus deserves all of those kudos, but we also have to ask ourselves about other enslaved people into the period of the Empire, and part of that is looking at enslaved people that rebel against Rome, whether they’re mint workers, whether they’re charioteers, whether they’re bear trainers, that we never have a slave revolt that is to the level of Spartacus that we know of within the Roman Empire for the rest of its existence, there’s never a rebellion that is to the degree that Spartacus inspired and carried out, but that there are still enslaved people that went on strike and that engaged in joining collegia.
And so circling back to that first thesis that I was talking about, just because enslaved people exist within a society does not mean that there cannot be labor organization and that there cannot be people working together for a higher purpose, right? And so sometimes that purpose is manumission, and sometimes that purpose is to get higher wages. But just because they’re enslaved does not mean that they’re completely impotent or without any power within this labor economy.
Nima: Well, I think that is a perfect place to leave it. Sarah, this has been so wonderful, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on this Citations Needed livestream Beg-a-Thon. It has been truly wonderful to talk to you, Sarah. We have been speaking with Dr. Sarah E. Bond, Associate Professor in the Classics at the University of Iowa. You do have, like, a longer title: Erling B. “Jack” Holtsmark?
Sarah E. Bond: I’m an endowed chair in the history, I’m technically in the History Department with an appointment in Classics. I have a chair. It does not matter.
Nima: I feel like I need to read that title. It’s very prestigious.
Sarah E. Bond: It doesn’t, well, it doesn’t mean that much, except for, you know, that I feel very lucky to have the job that I do, that this is my job, that I get to do all day. So that’s good enough.
Nima: Yeah, that’s very Stoic of you.
Sarah E. Bond: I see what you did there. I see what you did there.
Adam: She’s the emperor, though. That’s objectively a great job.
Nima: Sarah, of course, is the author of the incredible new book. Adam and I both read it.
Adam: We actually read it. We didn’t fake-read it. We actually read it.
Nima: Man, is it fucking great. So please pick it up. The book is, of course, Strike: Labor, Unions, and Resistance in the Roman Empire, out now from Yale University Press. But Sarah, thank you so much for joining us today on Citations Needed. It has been amazing to have you.

“Though you are a whole world, Rome, still, without love, the world’s not the world, and Rome cannot be Rome.” — Goethe
This book. I had this idea of traveling based on the books I was reading, and after nearly four years in Rome, I realized I had never read a book about the city itself. Perhaps I was too caught up in my daily struggles — and let me tell you, my life in Rome hasn’t been easy. Maybe my expectations were too high, or, as Goethe said, love was simply absent, and Rome wasn’t truly Rome to me. But this isn’t my story. Let’s get back to Anthony Doerr’s memoir.
As I write my humble thoughts on this memoir, I find myself flipping through its pages, revisiting the passages I underlined — the moments that touched my heart, the parts where I saw my own Roman story reflected. To be honest, Doerr’s first impressions of Rome mirrored how I felt after a year, maybe a year and a half, of living here.
I came to Rome for my master’s degree — my second one, actually — not just for academic reasons but as a way to escape Istanbul, to finally do something I had long felt was inevitable. I had always known my story wasn’t meant to unfold in just one city or country, though I had imagined it would be London, not Rome.
And yet, when I finally opened my eyes and truly started feeling Rome, it was exactly as Doerr described: noticing the endless sea of scooters, marveling at (or being horrified by) Italian driving, being simultaneously enchanted and frustrated by the city. In those early days, I was also angry — maybe disappointed — by what I had found here. And as I read through the beginning of Four Seasons in Rome, I could feel that same unease in Doerr’s words.
Throughout the pages, you experience what it’s like to be a parent to newborn twins — and, honestly, I’d much rather live that experience through his eyes than my own. But being in a foreign country doesn’t make it any easier. Even though our circumstances were different, there was one feeling we both shared: navigating this city while feeling lost — most of the time.
The missing piece, though, is love. I’m not sure if I should call myself fortunate, but in that regard, I’ve been quite lucky — if letting my heart get broken over and over counts as luck. I found real love here and lost it here. I cried here. I lost hope here. And yet, to truly experience Rome, love wasn’t necessary. As Doerr writes:
“And what about Rome? Rome is beautiful, Rome is ugly. Something about this city exacerbates contrast, the incongruities and contradictions…”
Rome has a way of filling that void in its own way, making sure you feel everything — whether you want to or not.
In the beginning, or let’s say during Fall, the book feels more factual, focused on adjustment. Doerr shares details about Rome, its quirks, its history. But as we move into Spring and Summer, we witness — or at least I felt — his gradual acceptance of the city, his growing appreciation for its beauty. And in these later chapters, the book shifts into something deeper. Not overwhelming, not philosophical, but it subtly invites the reader to take a step back, to ask certain questions, to reflect.
You should take note of the places Doerr mentions in this book — mostly around Monteverde, one of my favorite areas in Rome.
I’m not sure if anyone would be interested, so I won’t be sharing my full Roman guide, but I do want to give a shoutout to my favorite restaurants for the best carbonara. Why?
When I first moved to Rome, I was almost vegetarian — pescatarian, to be exact. While my friends indulged in legendary plates of pasta alla carbonara, I could only watch and wonder what all the fuss was about.
Then, for love, I started eating meat again. To be precise, I now eat guanciale, Italian cold cuts, poultry, and seafood — so really, there’s not much left off the menu, is there?
Naturally, my return to the eating-it-all era had to start with the famous carbonara. This passion quickly turned into a habit — I now order pasta alla carbonara every time I dine out. Here are some of my favorite spots to enjoy it:
I could go on forever — food is my passion, after all. But I suppose this article was meant to be about a book.
Okay, back to the book:
I’m so envious of Doerr for writing such a brilliantly pure, beautifully written book. No flashy marketing of la dolce vita — God knows I’m tired of the glossy image of Rome when the reality is far from dolce. He presents it all in a way that feels honest, and I couldn’t help but see parallels between the way Rome made him feel and the way I’ve felt since moving here.
I envy him even more because he came to Rome for a set period, with no trouble finding an apartment (thank you, Pope, honestly), which gave him the opportunity to experience the city without the complications that often come with living here. Or maybe the struggle is the true Roman experience. I’m not sure… Rome is my great dilemma and paradox.
Overall, I’m glad I don’t have to experience this city with newborn twins. I’m grateful for the daily challenges of living here and for the chance to experience life in its raw, unfiltered form. Rome is a beautiful city, though flawed in many ways. I can’t see myself growing old here — but that’s for purely professional reasons.
Finally, the author’s writing is captivating. Whether you live here or not, perhaps in another place, you’ll find yourself immersed in his story through his eyes. I absolutely loved this memoir, and it’s definitely a must-read. As he wrote:
“Roma, they say, non basta una vita. One life is not enough.”

Since the election in America, I have had to take a few somewhat drastic steps to maintain my sanity, and they began with divorcing myself from any and all news, primarily anything related to politics. Someone else I know called it Ostrich Mode, but I prefer to think of it as Turtle Mode. A complete withdrawal from most of society. Knowing how impulsive I can sometimes be, it’s hard to believe this will be a long-term thing, but you never know.
Therefore, out of fairness to all our writers, I am suspending the acceptance of any new writing at this time. I don’t want to ignore those trying to publish and I realize I risk permanently losing both readers and writers, but my only alternative is to either ignore the publication altogether, or delete it. I would prefer not deleting it at this time. The publication will remain live. I just won’t be accepting any new stories for the time being. I thank you for your understanding, and good luck.
If and when I regain some equilibrium, I’ll let you know and we’ll get back to business.

Bam, here we are, back in his apartment close to Altitude 100, where the chicken drawing has been set straight. The place is clean, relatively orderly now and C. is cooking a gourmet dinner for us. He is French, you can’t teach much more to a French guy who knows how to cook. You mostly sit down and enjoy the food he is making and the show of him making it. The ingredients come out of brown paper wrappings, not from plastic bags. The man loves to show his skill. Nevertheless, he burns a couple of the dishes, possibly stage fright? That’s OK, I think I’m getting used to his way of self-sabotaging his best intentions. So we sit down and eat some very sophisticated, yet burned entrées, under the modernistic chicken gaze.
There is no male gaze anywhere that I can see here, but there is this chicken looking down on us. This brings an offbeat touch to things. I feel safe with him, he is generous and open. His engaged leftism makes me look centrist at best, in many topics and it makes me reconsider some of my positions. He is softly teasing me about working for a big nasty corporation, in marketing of all things. While he is the gauchist journalist investigating big…

Every successful school of thought, religion and system that has endured the test of time has one common precept: When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
It means that if your idea is universal enough to offer food for thought and even some enlightening properties, your approach must be adaptable to changing circumstances, cultures and norms. But with one catch: the core teaching must remain universal and comprehensive — intact.
The saying I quoted earlier comes from the 4th century Bishop of Milan, St Ambrose. He was a theologian and statesman with solid leadership, profoundly shaping early Christian theology and doctrine.
Ambrose was what we call an inspirational speaker. He could wow the audience but didn’t let popularity blur his views. He didn’t let anything dilute his faith and was fierce against heresy. The saying attributed to him tells us about a person who is pragmatic yet has strong integrity.

Migrants poured over the southern border. Many came for jobs after employment options in their home regions had dried up; others were attracted to the excitement and glamour of their destination. Soon the influx began to worry leading politicians, who authorized a series of enforcement actions against select categories of immigrants. Deportations, they believed, would put an end to the mess. No luck: undeterred, the immigrants kept coming.
At last, one politician ventured a proposal. Why not extend the citizenship? Not to all non-citizens, of course — just to one specific, carefully circumscribed subset. But one party was having none of it: “if you give them citizenship,” the party’s spokesman insisted, “you assume (I think) that you’ll still have the same political rights and worship in the same way as you do now. But don’t you realize that those people will take over everything?” The proposal withered on the vine.
The speaker of these lines was Gaius Fannius, consul in 122 BCE and a dogged opponent of Gaius Gracchus’ proposal to extend the citizenship to Rome’s Latin allies. For all its celebrated inclusivity, ancient Rome had residents and leaders who were none too pleased about the continuous stream of immigrants: Fannius’ warning is a distant echo of Donald Trump’s “we either have a country or we don’t have a country.” Romans were as willing as many Americans are today to give this displeasure political and legal expression.
But why undertake this rewriting of late republican Rome in the first place? Partly because in doing so I join a modern conversation about immigration that — in both Europe and America — regularly and explicitly adduces parallels from the ancient world as justification for various kinds of immigration policy. In this article, I’ll examine the sentimental and rhetorical configurations through which ancient Rome (and Greece) are put to work in contemporary discussions of immigration and outline how Romans themselves perceived and responded to immigration during the Republic and Empire. In a second, follow-up article, I’ll explore how mobility in the ancient Mediterranean structurally mirrored 21st-century migration towards Europe and the United States. Ancient history can clarify how we think about recent developments, just not in the way(s) normally assumed.
Let me stress that my own perspective as a formerly undocumented immigrant with emphatically pro-migrant political commitments informs what and how I write. No Tacitean disavowal of bias for me. But I hope that even those who do not share my views on immigration will consider how antiquity can be repurposed in modern conversations about immigration.
Writing in the pages of The Wall Street Journal, Cambridge classicist Mary Beard recently asserted that the Romans “would have been puzzled by today’s hostility to migrants.” Well before the publication of the op-ed, Beard made use of her status as one of Britain’s foremost public intellectuals to offer a liberal perspective — sometimes greeted with viciously misogynistic hostility — on contemporary migrant and refugee matters.
The tradition of roping the ancient world into assessments of modern immigration has been a fixture of British political and cultural discourses for quite some time: Enoch Powell’s infamous 1968 “Rivers of Blood” speech (complete with Vergilian allusion) standing at one end of the political spectrum, with Boris Johnson’s 2006 Dream of Rome closer to the other. As Mayor of London, Johnson has continued beating the classical drum, issuing warnings that Britain will turn into the ancient state least like Rome in its treatment of foreigners — Sparta — should it adhere to plans to reduce its net migration.
On the other side of the Atlantic, another professional classicist has intervened in the immigration debates: Victor Davis Hanson. Not one to be deterred by the prospect of controversy, Hanson waded into the immigration-policy waters with his 2003 hybrid-genre book Mexifornia. After first observing that “America is what Rome once was to hustling Jews, Greeks and Numidians” (p. 51), Hanson goes on to claim in his epilogue that the “freedom and material dynamism of the West are drawing millions to its shores — in the manner that Athens once attracted metics from Asia, and Rome drew Africans, Jews and Armenians” (p. 142). (And as proof that classicists holding forth on immigration can irritate members of the political establishment, one need look no further than Hanson: after introducing himself as a “classicist” at a Capitol Hill briefing the year of his book’s publication, Hanson was reportedly accosted by a Congressional staffer who thought he had heard Hanson term himself a “classist”; the face-off ended with the staffer exiting the briefing in anger.)
Comparisons of modern America to ancient Rome are, of course, nothing new, and so hackneyed by now as to inspire a book-length rebuttal. But in recent decades many of these comparisons have been fueled by anxieties about immigration, particularly of the illegal/undocumented variety. Actress and conservative politician Clare Boothe Luce expressed concern in a 1982 Washington Post interview that the United States might be headed “for the fate of ancient Rome … a city of pollution and noise and foreigners, [that] collapsed under the weight of the barbarians.”
Since 9/11, the argument that a lax immigration policy will hasten the United States’ Rome-like demise has steadily gained traction. A 2004 Florida Times-Union editorial on “illegal immigration and the problems that go with it” ended on this ominous note: “ancient Rome couldn’t, or wouldn’t, stop the influx of barbarians across its border.” Taking to The Washington Post in 2007 to outline a “tolerant but also tough” vision for US immigration policy, Yale Law School professor Amy Chua reminded her readers that the “greatest empire in history, ancient Rome, collapsed when its cultural and political glue dissolved … [i]n part, this fragmentation occurred because of a massive influx of immigrants from a very different culture.” Three years later, Stevens Institute of Technology professor Silvio Laccetti argued that Rome’s extension of its citizenship through the Edict of Caracalla had precipitated an “erosion of civic pride and responsibility” in the course of outlining his own proposal of a tolerant but tough immigration scheme. And in undoubtedly the most entertaining riff on the Rome conceit, Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) went full Cicero on the Senate floor — framing Obama as Catiline — following the President’s November 2014 announcement of an executive order deferring the deportation of undocumented parents of American citizens and permanent residents.
You wouldn’t be wrong to suspect that the genealogy I’ve charted so far has an even deeper history: the practice of invoking the Roman Republic and Empire’s treatment of immigrants as paradigmatic and/or cautionary is already on display in the state- and nation-building discourses of the early modern period. Edward Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire reserves the purplest of its purple prose for the barbarians at the gate and the Fifth Column of immigrant slaves and domestics waiting to welcome them. (Last year, a lengthy rumination — sprinkled with block quotations from Decline and Fall — on Gibbon’s continuing relevance was posted to breitbart.com under the pseudonym “Virgil” and triggered over 1400 comments, mostly effusions of agreement.) Before Gibbon, Montesquieu had sketched the contribution of foreigners and barbarians to Rome’s imperial dissolution in chapter 16 of his Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline.
But well before either, Machiavelli had taken a somewhat different line on immigration in Discourses on Livy, praising Rome’s openness to foreigners as integral to the amassing of the military and economic power through which the republic set itself apart from Athens and Sparta (II.3). Machiavelli wasn’t just anticipating Boris Johnson’s evaluation of Roman greatness as a consequence of open migration. Diligent reader of Livy that he was, Machiavelli was putting his finger on a line of argument that reached back to the ancients themselves.
The history of rhetorically positioning Rome’s treatment of immigrants really begins in antiquity, with both Greeks and Romans chiming in on the fluctuating — and at times very divergent — trends in the Republic and Empire’s openness. Having worked our way backwards in time to the ancients, we should now pause and ask: how open were Romans to foreigners, really? It turns out that Romans were far more ambivalent about immigration than some moderns give them credit for.
In the first decade of the war with Hannibal, a Macedonian king turned Roman adversary praised the Republic’s free and easy bestowal of citizenship in a letter exchange with a Greek city-state. In a world where city-states could be quite stingy with grants of citizenship — especially Sparta, notorious for its deportations — Rome had so succeeded in marketing itself as exceptional that even an enemy felt compelled to take notice. This marketing took several forms, and the one that has left the most durable imprint on literary and non-literary sources alike is Rome’s origin myth.
In contrast to the Greek city-states whose origin stories indulged the fantasy of autochthony (according to which a community and its members sprang up from the earth in the place they inhabited), Rome promoted itself as the product of immigrants. Molded during the turbulent centuries of Italian and Mediterranean expansion, Rome’s legendary history began with an illegal immigrant: pious Aeneas, fleeing with his family and friends from the devastation of Troy household gods in hand, elderly father on his back, young son by his side.
As canonized in the Aeneid, the challenges faced by the founder of the Roman race include some of the traditional (epic) dilemmas of travel — where to go and how long to stay, whose hospitality to accept and whose to decline — Homeric effects translated for a Roman audience. And once Aeneas and his band do arrive on Italian shores, they are denied the happily-ever-after outcome. Their lot is to contend with belligerence, grief, early death.
Some months ago, Michael Fontaine proposed in this publication a reading of the Aeneid’s second half that aligns rather felicitously with contemporary geopolitical events. On one level, the Aeneas myth internalizes the plight of immigrants/refugees (fato profugi); at the same time, it gives form to the mirror anxiety of those native residents who from the first encounter feel that the new arrivals will take their land and resources and women.
Spinning out this thread further, I’d add that the ambivalence towards refugees and immigrants woven into the Aeneas legend reflects centuries of unease at Rome about the presence and role of foreigners. The unease was embodied in the mythic personas of Aeneas, Romulus, and Remus, all three of whom were remembered as thieves, rapists, and murderers. Here comparison with the modern myth of the immigrant as criminal is instructive. Earlier this year, to thumps and cheers, Trump laid out his campaign platform on immigration:
“The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems…When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best…They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us [sic]. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”
Trump and his partisans seem to have a complementary myth at hand: the “Ellis Island” arrivals of virtuous character and exemplary work ethic (unlike today’s purveyors of drugs and crime). Much the same conflict between these two alternate ideals of the immigrant played out in ancient Rome. As Rome expanded, nativist and xenophobic discourses proliferated, with consequences for the waves of immigrants settling down in Rome in the last centuries of the Republic and first few centuries of the Empire.
These discourses had sharp legal teeth. On top of the targeted removals and expulsions of groups identified as religiously and/or philosophical suspect — the Bacchants in 186 BCE, philosophers in 161 and 154, Chaldaeans and Jews in 139 — immigrants hailing from communities elsewhere in Italy were deported on multiple occasions in the years 187–172 (citations and discussion: Noy, Foreigners at Rome, pp. 37–47). Sometime in the 120s, a law was passed expelling all foreigners from the city of Rome; another version of the law was passed in 65 BCE. Thanks to the Severan-era historian Cassius Dio, we know something of the reasons for the second law’s passage (37.9): not only were foreigners believed to be too numerous, it was worried that they weren’t suitable enough (epitedeioi) to live alongside Romans.
It’s worth remembering that throughout this entire time Rome still had a republican system of government. These laws were ratified by popular will and not autocratic imposition. Since foreigners couldn’t necessarily be identified on sight (any romano di Roma stood a decent chance of being physically indistinguishable from an immigrant), it is anyone’s guess how these laws were enforced. The association of specific neighborhoods with certain groups of immigrants may have played a role in the orchestration of round-ups.
We do know that one Roman witness to the law of 65 did not like what he saw. Characterizing this law and its predecessor from the 120s as designed not only to deny foreigners access to Rome but to deport those already living there (eosque exterminant), Cicero declares in the De officiis that “denying foreigners access to our city is patently inhumane” (3.11.47). Although he managed to successfully defend the poet Aulus Licinius Archias from deportation, Cicero laments in a letter to his friend Atticus that the same law had been deployed, out of spite, to condemn (and presumably deport) a freedman assistant to the politician and former consul Aulus Gabinius after Gabinius beat charges of political corruption.
Neither the moral nor rhetorical authority of Cicero could halt the policing and deportation of certain categories of immigrants; the practice persisted well into the Empire. Yet immigrants kept on coming. The satirist Juvenal’s bombastic xenophobe Umbricius couldn’t abide their presence: “Romans, I can’t tolerate the city being Greek. Yet what portion of the shit is really Greek? For a long time now the Syrian Orontes has poured into the Tiber…” (Sat. 3.58–60). But for the Greek-speaking author of The Learned Banqueters, it was precisely Rome’s embrace of different immigrant populations that enhanced its glory: it was a heavenly city, encompassing so many foreign populations as to defy enumeration (Deipn. 1.20b-c).
We should be careful to respect the differences between ancient Rome and the modern US (or Europe). For example, the preoccupation with “border enforcement” wasn’t quite as intense among the Romans — though perhaps the time has come to read Augustus’ reported advice to Tiberius to “keep the empire’s borders secure” (my consciously tendentious rendering of Tacitus’ enigmatic coercendi intra terminos imperii) and/or Aelius Aristides’ praise of the Empire’s walls in his Roman Oration as implicated in a kind of border politics. And at no point in its trajectory from Republic or Empire was Rome a nation in the modern sense.
But with these caveats out of the way, I want to underline a few fundamental similarities between the immigration sensibilities of ancient Rome and those of 21st-century America. Then as now, foundation myths about the state as the creation of immigrants articulated and projected deeply felt anxieties about the legacy of past immigrants and the presence of current ones. Then as now, some of those anxieties were worked out through legal-administrative means, with deportation privileged as a technology of control. Then as now, foreigners stood to lose the most in confrontations between political elites — think back to Gabinius’ freedman. Then as now, the immigrant influx could inspire despair over the country going to rot or euphoria at its cosmopolitan inclusivity. Then as now, immigrants were vulnerable to hate crimes.
Hate crimes, you say?
Earlier this year, “Death to Islam” was spray-painted on the wall of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Heritage Association center in Spokane, Washington. Thousands of hate crimes are reported in the United States each year. These figures — dismayingly consistent from year to year — probably underrepresent the true number of hate crimes perpetrated. Setting aside for now the reliability of the FBI statistics, I want to concentrate on the graffito as medium for xenophobia. Even for the spray-painter, there is ancient precedent.
At some point during the second century CE, a tombstone was set up in Rome under the supervision of a certain Charitonius Mercurius for a deceased cavalry officer. From the tombstone we learn that the officer — whose name is not preserved in what remains of the inscription — was of Arabian extraction (natione Arabus); he’d lived to the age of 35, soldiering for 16 of those years and attaining the rank of eques singularis along the way. Many examples of this type of inscription survive, but in this case the real kicker comes in the form of a Greek graffito left behind by someone, possibly a fellow cavalry officer, that reads: Θ. Ἄραπσι (“Death to the Arabs!”).
The cultural and linguistic complexities of xenophobic resentment in Imperial Rome were such that a Greek-speaking resident of Rome could scrawl an ethnic taunt on a monument to a Latin-speaking native of the Near East. Romans were quite skilled at the use of graffiti to mock the immigrant Other: the late second/early third-century CE graffito from the Palatine featuring a donkey on a crucifix and the tag (again in Greek) “Alexamenos worships God” may be the earliest example of such visual denigration being applied to Greek-speaking Christians residing in Rome — and takes us back to the anxiety voiced by Gaius Fannius that immigrants would menace religious practices at home.
But my interest in summoning up the ghost of the graffito artist who marked up the tombstone has to do with the fantasy of violence folded into the tag. The cavalry officer was already dead, else he might have had a thing or two to say to the violator of his memorial. Alive and far more vulnerable was the homeless Mexican man recently beaten by two Boston men, one of whom claimed as his inspiration Donald Trump’s call to deport the undocumented.
Trump’s rhetoric justifies the commission of acts of violence against immigrants by characterizing them as inherently violent. On the stump, he has bemoaned the scourge of rapists, murderers and thieves originating not only in Mexico but “coming from all over South and Latin America and … coming probably, probably, from the Middle East.” It doesn’t seem to register among his fans that the “problem” of immigrant crime is a fiction: multiple studies carried out over the past century have repeatedly confirmed that immigrants commit crime at lower rates than the general population. What does register is the fear-mongering, especially among those already inclined to believe that white Americans are endangered: in July a petition was posted to WhiteHouse.gov asking President Obama to honor Trump “for opposing white genocide.”
Once the immigrant is construed as an existential threat, xenophobic sentiment rallies around the idea of removing that threat by any and all means necessary. Both in ancient Rome and in modern America, the fear of immigrants activates not only the desire to remove their bodies from sight through deportation, but to deprive them of life — to destroy them.

December 1, 2024First Sunday of Advent, Year CSt. Stephen’s UMC, Burke, VARomans 8:18–25 (NRSVUE)**A Sermon Series on Fuquay’s The Way to Bethlehem
For this season of Advent — a time of anticipation and preparation for the coming Christ — we will base our sermon series on Rob Fuquay’s book titled On the Way to Bethlehem: An Advent Study.
Throughout this series, we will visit four key places, starting with Rome, then moving to Jerusalem and Nazareth, and finally arriving in Bethlehem. My prayer is that as we embark on this journey together, the Spirit will guide us closer to the humble manger in Bethlehem, where we encounter Love Incarnate — God-with-us — the one named Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, and Prince of Peace.
You may wonder why we start with Rome. All the other locations seem straightforward. The Gospel of Luke begins in Jerusalem, where the angel announced Elizabeth’s pregnancy to Zechariah who was serving in the temple. Then it moves to Nazareth, where the same angel announced the pregnancy news to Elizabeth’s much younger cousin, Mary. Afterward, Mary and Joseph had to travel to Bethlehem, where Jesus was ultimately born.
So, why does this Advent journey start in Ancient Rome?
Just like how people consider Washington D.C. as a focal point of America’s power and influence, Rome symbolizes the power and influence that makes up its empire which stretched vastly across Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, including the regions of Judea where much of the New Testament narrative takes place.
This Roman Empire is often regarded as one of the most successful civilizations in human history. During the period of the Pax Romana, which means “Roman Peace” in Latin, the empire experienced centralized governance, economic prosperity, cultural flourishing, and relative stability — all the things we, humans, across time, hope for in their governments.
A key factor contributing to the period of the Pax Romana was the infrastructure developed under the reign of Caesar Augustus. During his forty-year rule, Augustus oversaw the construction of approximately fifty thousand miles of highways, creating an extensive network of roads that facilitated travel and communication. This network boosted trade, streamlined administration, and enabled the spread of ideas across the empire. Additionally, these roads allowed Roman legions to move swiftly, ensuring rapid responses to uprisings and external threats, thereby solidifying Rome’s control over its vast and diverse territories.
While the Pax Romana brought unprecedented peace and prosperity to Roman citizens, it came at a steep cost for many, particularly noncitizens and marginalized groups. High taxes were levied to sustain Rome’s massive military and ambitious infrastructure projects, disproportionately burdening conquered peoples and lower classes. Enslavement was widespread, with millions of individuals from conquered territories forced into servitude to fuel the empire’s economy and labor needs. Noncitizens lacked the legal protections and privileges of Roman citizens and were frequently exploited or oppressed under imperial rule. For many, the Pax Romana was not a time of peace but one of subjugation, inequality, and suffering under the heavy hand of empire.
Mary and Joseph were among those living under Roman occupation as Jews, part of the conquered peoples and noncitizens of the empire. And their journey to Bethlehem was not one of choice but of obligation, prompted by a decree from Caesar Augustus, calling for a census. And this census was a common tool of an empire, often used to increase tax revenues to support its vast ambitions.
So, imagine how these conquered people, including Mary and Joseph, felt as they trudged toward Bethlehem. There might have been a sense of helplessness as they complied with orders, knowing they had no choice. Perhaps there was skepticism and fear, wondering what new demands or hardships might further complicate their already difficult lives. Perhaps they felt resignation and complacency, accepting their reality that the only way to survive was to serve the empire without resistance. Or maybe they felt the weight of defeat and hopelessness, quietly echoing the psalmist’s cry: “How long, O Lord?” (Psalm 13).
Although we are no conquered people, perhaps we can relate to them in some way — especially to the feeling of helplessness before the forces that shape our lives. On a systemic level, we recognize policies and systems beyond our control that bring harm, prioritize profit over people, and perpetuate inequality or suffering, impacting countless lives, especially those who are marginalized and voiceless. On a personal level, we acknowledge forces that harm us and leave us feeling defeated, despite our deep longing for change — whether it be chronic illness, long-term addiction, destructive habits, abusive relationships, or loneliness. Scripture calls these forces, which operate on personal, systemic, and cosmic levels, “principalities and powers” (Eph 6:12). These forces can feel like chains of bondage and captivity, leaving us yearning for liberation and longing for a hope that can break through and set us free. This is the very starting point of our journey: Rome represents the seat of these principalities and powers, a place where “our hopes and fears are released and sometimes collide.” Thus, Advent begins with longing — longing for change, longing for freedom, longing for justice, longing for peace, longing for deliverance, longing for salvation, longing for the Savior.
Out of Israel’s longing for a Savior, Jesus Christ was born.
But that is only half of the Advent story.
The other half of the story is
that out of our longing for a Savior, Jesus Christ will come again.
Isn’t that the mystery of faith we proclaim?
Christ has died; Christ is risen; Christ will come again.
So, let me ask you:
The Apostle Paul speaks to our experience of longing in today’s scripture, written to the house churches in Rome who were expecting Jesus’ return within their lifetime. Their waiting for the coming of Christ met with the harsh reality of suffering. As you know, they were the church in Rome, the very seat of principalities and powers. Once again, in the midst of suffering, they longed for change, redemption, and restoration; they groaned for their Savior.
Paul writes to their experience, emphasizing that it is not just they but the whole creation that groans together for salvation, as if enduring the pains of labor. In other words, their shared suffering is not the end — it is a hopeful anticipation of new birth and new life. Although all they could see and feel now is indescribable pain, Paul encourages them to wait in eager longing and hope, for a wonderful gift of future glory is on the way.
And this expectant groaning of labor pains still applies to us today. We continue to wait in hopeful anticipation for new birth and new life, even in the face of the present sufferings in our world, which we experience and for which we intercede. And we remain hopeful because of the first fruits of the Spirit: the glimpses of God’s kingdom, the moments when the Holy Spirit moves among us, and the gifts of grace we witness every day through Christ. In other words, we remain hopeful because our God intercedes for us in our collective suffering.
Consider the glimpses of God’s kingdom, the moments when the Holy Spirit has moved among us, or the gifts of grace we have witnessed. These phrases often describe experiences that exceed our expectations and understandings. These capture divine surprises that defy our skepticism and cynicism. These embody the extraordinary love we receive from those who reflect Christ. These first-fruit experiences are what keep us hopeful in our suffering. And our state of hopefulness in labor pain produces in us not only trust and firmness in the faith, but also a different way of living. Through our words and actions, we reveal an alternative way of being in the world through sharing the gifts of the Spirit with those around us.
Again, I find Paul’s metaphor of labor pain brilliant. I remember being in a delivery room for almost twenty-four hours, being next to my wife as she endured intense pain and extreme fatigue. And we were there pushing for this baby to come out in hopeful anticipation, without any idea of what this baby would become, what gifts she would bring to our family, or how her presence would alter our lives.
As Paul writes in today’s scripture, hope that is seen is not hope, but we hope for what we do not see. And we do so with endurance, steadfastness, and perseverance — which are what the translated word patience tries to convey. I think this is both the most beautiful and frustrating part of our Christian journey: we do not hope for what is seen but for what we do not see. Our hope lies not in absolute certainty but in humble mystery. Our hope flourishes not in human preference but in divine imagination.
This is the very movement of our faith journey, revealed through the story of Advent. Out of Israel’s longing for a Savior, Jesus Christ was born in the most unexpected way possible — in a lowly manger as a helpless baby. Out of Creation’s longing for a Savior, Jesus brought salvation to us in the most unexpected way possible — through death on a cross and resurrection. Out of our longing for a Savior, Jesus has and will continue to reveal himself to us in unexpected ways. And out of the whole Creation’s longing for a Savior, we believe Jesus Christ will come again in the most unexpected way possible.
Dear church, let me ask you these questions once again:
Whenever we think about these things, we often wish — perhaps most of the time — that God would just act like a human empire, issuing decrees to put a swift end to our misery and all human sufferings. We wish God would just tell us imperatively what to do so we no longer have to deal with all these problems.
But, as the book On the Way to Bethlehem beautifully describes,¹
God does not decree. Rater, God births. God sends a baby, a Son. A Son who would be killed by the empire under which he was born, suffering a Roman crucifixion. Why? So that something new could be birthed in our hearts. Whatever change needs to happen in our world begins with our being born again. For what does creation wait for with eager longing? “For the revealing of the children of God.” [That’s] us, born again.
Despite how much we might wish the church could operate like an empire, the church is called to be more like a harvest field — patiently spreading the seeds of God’s kingdom in all soils, with hope that those seeds will sprout and grow in our hearts. Only then can we be born again, yielding a harvest of fruits to be shared with the world.
As we begin this Advent season, I pray that seeds of divine imagination take root in our hearts. May the story of Christmas be more than an occasion to revisit an old tale. May it become an invitation to leave behind our “Rome” with hopeful anticipation. As we draw closer to O little town of Bethlehem, may Christ be born anew in our hearts, and may we, too, be renewed and born again in Christ.
In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

What to read before your Italian adventure!
There can’t be a definitive list of books to read before going travelling to a glorious new destination, but I tried to find and read as many recommendations as I could before my trip to Florence and Rome, and here are the books that I found most enjoyable and interesting.
My top choice funnily enough, was from a series of books called Horrible Histories that I read when I was younger, and found that it had the most comprehensive whistle-stop tour of ancient Rome presented in an entertaining manner for a busy but curious traveller.
The Ruthless Romans is full of jokes, anecdotes, and important historical figures. It covers Ancient Rome from 1000 BC - 476 AD and is shockingly dense and informative for such an easy read. If you don’t have any time at all, try reading this on the plane to da Vinci airport.
Between the collapse of the Republic and start of the Roman Empire is a key piece that I read in high school: Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare. I don’t think you need to read Shakespeare before a trip, but if you like me have fond memories of sitting in class mesmerized by a political conflict written four centuries ago about a historical event from a couple of millennia ago, then you’ll remember the irony that in killing Caesar for his assumed monarchic intent, the Senate all but ensured that “another Caesar” would eventually take over Rome as its first emperor: Augustus.
To go off on another minor nostalgic tangent, if Shakespeare is too much of a commitment before a trip to Rome, Asterix hilariously covers the Roman campaigns that lead to the events in Julius Caesar.
For some real, serious history, these two were the most recommended:
Unfortunately I only managed to dip my toes in them before my trip and they were very dense and informative.
On a lighter note, I did breeze through Angels and Demons. It was an action-packed thriller that plays fast and loose with facts.
I liked that it covered Vatican City, which none of the previous books do, and touched on the works of Botticelli and Dante, who were both all over especially Florence and Rome.
For Florence, I’ve been reading The Enchantress of Florence that does an incredible job setting the stage for what the world was like in the 16th century and how interconnected Italy, Turkey, India and everything in between were by trade links and travellers.
Some other books by Italian authors and set in Italy that I didn’t have a chance to read but would like to in the future are:
And to throw it in there because it was everywhere, especially in Florence where Dante’s bones aren’t: The Divine Comedy.

The plan was to end the day at the Villa Borghese gardens, but with twenty more minutes of walking and legs already exhausted from a full day on foot, it didn’t seem worth it.
Instead, I stopped on a pedestrian terrace along the busy Via Frattina, not far from my hotel.
A glass of red wine, a seat outside, and a bit of people-watching paired with a book. It’s a great exercise to avoid reaching for your phone when you’re sitting alone.
The café held me for about half an hour, soaking in the buzz of the street and the taste of the wine.
Once the last sip of Italian red was gone, I headed back to the Bulgari hotel to get my power bank. Yes, I was staying at the Bulgari hotel, and no, I can’t afford it. That’s a story for another time.
As I approach the reception, five people in uniform turn to face me.
I ask if I can grab something from my bags, which were stored in the luggage room, and a beautiful young man smiles at me, “Of course. Follow me.”
We walk into the room, and he leads me to my things.
“Oh, so you don’t need this. You know which ones they are.” I say quietly, as I glance down…

Non-members of Medium can read the full article here.
I first visited Rome with my family a few years back. We were planning to do the main touristy things, but when faced with the endless queue in St Peter’s Square, we had a change of plan and a wander down to the river instead.
I’d not done much research for the trip, unusual for me, but I wasn’t organising it — my role was just to turn up and enjoy! So I had no idea what other attractions were within walking distance. But we were pretty sure there would be a cafe where we could sit and watch the world go by fairly close by.
We walked past the street sellers, their souvenirs spread out on tarpaulins, and approached the river. My attention was drawn to the building on my left, first the light stone walls, then the darker brick of the heart of the castle, and I was hit by the strangest feeling of déjà vu. I knew this building, it’s curved ramparts, the flagpole on top. But this was my first trip to Rome. Why was a place I’d never been to so familiar?

Rome might be it for me. The one. The city above all others. The one you find yourself Googling flights to late at night, even when you’ve just arrived home from your last trip.
I think we all have places like that.
A few months ago, I visited Rome for the fourth time. One of those times was a month-long trip and I can tell you, it was one of the highlights of my three-year-long travels. I never wanted to leave because Rome has exactly what I love in a city. Beauty. Atmosphere. And one of my favourite food and drink cultures in the world.
Yes, there are tourist traps. Yes, some places will give you a raw deal in bad pasta, bad pizza and bad wine. But there is also value to be found. You can find pizza that will do things to you. You can eat pasta that will ruin every other pasta you eat henceforth (it’s that good).
If you want to eat and drink well in this city, you’ve just got to know where to go.
Every day in Rome starts with a caffè and a maritozzo — Rome’s famous cream-filled…

As is well-known, Rome was founded by the legendary brothers Romulus and Remus, who originated from Alba Longa and belonged to one of the Latin tribes. However, as Rome grew into a vast and powerful state, the Romans decided having only local Italian shepherds among their ancestors wasn’t very prestigious. It would be much cooler if the Romans descended from a well-known, celebrated people in legends, even better — from a great hero. And they found such a heroic ancestor. He was Aeneas, a hero from Troy who left his homeland after the city’s fall.
This legend did not immediately become widely accepted among the Romans. The 1st-century BC Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus presents three versions of the Roman origins he knew: Italy, Libya, and Greece. In the last case, he refers to Greek colonists who had long lived on the Apennine Peninsula. However, Dionysius favored the view that the Romans were of mixed Greek-Italian origin. At the same time, Dionysius mentions the Roman version that Romulus and Remus were sons of Aeneas, implying that Rome was built by the second generation of Trojan refugees.

Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus.
I know what you’re thinking.
What a name!
I agree.
Sadly, the man with this name is responsible for a lot of naughty nonsense.
First off, he murdered his own mother.
If that wasn’t enough, he also murdered his first wife.
And his second wife?
Kicked her to death while she was pregnant.
Yeah, we’re dealing with a monstrosity.
Sadly, his cruelty wasn’t just reserved for his close family members.
He also used to host parties where he’d light people on fire (usually Christians) while he and his guests would frolic to fiddle music.
All while, Rome was engulfed in flames.
The guy was a psycho.
And in this article, I’m going to go all in on the lad known as Nero: Rome’s most notorious emperor.
Nero was the fifth Roman emperor, ruling from 54 AD to 68 AD.

We had been waiting 30 minutes for the tour to begin. Stepping into a small spot of shade, I wiped the sweat from my face. It was only 10:30, and already the temperature had soared to 95.
“I thought this tour was supposed to start at 10,” I grumbled to my husband, who was also angling for shade.
“It was also supposed to be a private tour,” he said. “But there are 19 of us.”
My husband and I like private tours when we travel, to avoid the sort of scenario we were currently experiencing. Group tour guides are informative and engaging, but there are always tourists who can’t keep up, want to cut the excursion short, or show up late.
Today, two people hadn’t shown up. The excursion was supposed to be a nine-hour walking tour of Rome, and I was ready to get started. Our guide, an Italian woman with thick, black hair and a round face flushed with heat, tried to keep the 19 tourists in our group cheerful.
“Just a few more minutes. I believe the late ones are coming,” she chirped, forcing a smile. “Ah! Here they are!”
I watched as two grumpy blonde women trudged through the crowd towards our group. One was youngish, her expression…

Helpful hints on how to have a miserable but interesting time in the Eternal City.
Listen, I love Rome. I really do but now that we’re more or less free to travel again, I feel compelled to fill you in on the Eternal City. Masochists will love it. So will anybody else drawn to stress and anxiety. Don’t get me wrong, Rome has a lot of things going for it. Historical buildings, pizza, magnificent museums, pizza, stunning churches, pizza. Did I say pizza? Over four million tourists a year visit the Eternal City and, for the most part, Rome is prepared. Yet there are a few trouble spots that can turn a Roman holiday into a Roman nightmare.
Rome is always crowded and those walking tours led by tour guides with flags or umbrellas only make things worse. These human centipedes shuffle, and I do mean shuffle, along the sidewalk and hold up the rest of us with places to go. They’re everywhere but particularly dense around the Vatican Museum and the Trevi Fountain. Especially the Tevi. The Fountain is hemmed in by narrow streets that funnel pedestrians into the site like sheep to the slaughter. Good luck with getting a clear view. Keep in mind there are equally…

Book Review: Are We Rome? The Fall of an Empire and the Fate of America by Cullen Murphy,https://medium.com/@desireewinns/book-review-are-we-rome-the-fall-of-an-empire-and-the-fate-of-america-by-cullen-murphy-6ba9c929abf2,"Sign up

Is America the new Roman Empire, and if so, will it meet the same fate? This book argues that America and Rome are similar in terms of their psychology and soft power, from the way Washington and Rome view themselves as the center of their worlds, to the global and historical impacts of their cultures. In the beginning, Murphy notes Freud’s comparison of the human psyche and the ruins of Rome, the possibility of histories existing simultaneously rather than one after the other. It’s a theme that runs throughout each chapter as Murphy compares the militaries, borders, people, and cultures of Rome and America. Considering how much Roman culture and iconography shape the ways Americans symbolize and discuss their own power, it really does seem like Rome and America exist together. However, Murphy posits that America’s capability for relatively rapid social transformation (especially in just two centuries) is what separates it from its doomed predecessor, and what will save it from the same fate. I’d pick this book up if you’re interested in learning how the cultural and psychological power of empires expands beyond centuries. In the end you’ll definitely wonder if Rome ever did fall.

Rome is a city of amazing pizza, pasta, and gelato, but if you’re looking for a healthy break from all those delicious carbs, here are 4 great places where you can get fresh juices and smoothies:
Esco Sazio — This adorable little shop offers completely organic juices and smoothies, in addition to healthy sandwiches and salads. Swing on one of their wooden swings as you drink your juice and enjoy the chalkboard-meets-chandelier ambiance. Our girls loved the chocolate banana protein smoothie, and I enjoyed my tropical juice with pineapple and guava.
Via dei Banchi Vecchi, 135, 00186 Roma, Italy
Pronto — We stumbled across this restaurant in Rome’s Monti neighborhood, near the Colosseum, and stopped in when we saw their “fresh juices” sign. Their fruit is freshly chopped, juiced, and blended (if you get juice with pears in it) right in front of you, and the three juices that we tried were all fantastic. You can take your juice outside and hang out at the fountain with the locals while you drink it and take in the area’s energetic vibe.
Via dei Serpenti, 163, Roma
Aromaticus — This restaurant is also in the trendy Monti area, and they serve fresh juices and clean, mostly raw and unprocessed foods (salads, hummus, beef tartare, etc.). The shop itself is cute and hip, decorated with vintage cookbooks and selling potted herbs and gardening supplies, and the food and juice are excellent. The pineapple-mint juice was one of the best juices I’ve ever had, so perfectly sweet and delicious, and Joshua loved his Greek salad with pita bread, hummus, cherry tomatoes, olives, and feta cheese.
Via Urbana, 134, 00184 Roma, Italy
AllBiOne — Self-described as “organic street food”, AllBiOne serves organic juices, cut-up fresh fruit, and 14 different kinds of organic meatballs… everything from beef and tomato or chicken and curry to vegetarian eggplant parmesan or ricotta and pecorino cheese balls. Everything we ate was tasty, but I highly recommend the cheese “meat”balls, and the juices we got were fresh and delicious.
The restaurant is a short walk from the Colosseum, and the owner is really friendly — he overheard us talking about wanting strawberries in a juice for the girls, and he offered to make a strawberry-apple-orange juice for them that wasn’t listed on the board; it turned out to be perfect for them!
Largo Corrado Ricci, 34, Roma, Italy
Do you know another great juice bar in Rome? Leave a comment and share it with us!

Celebrating the Western tradition, from Romulus to Rembrandt.

--
Listen
Share
The traditional story of Rome’s founding is a classic tale, one that every schoolchild used to learn. One of the greatest civilizations of the Western world, Rome shaped our modern society more than any other ancient culture (with the possible exception of Greece). To understand the incredible story — somewhat dubious historicity aside — is to gain insight into the folklore and heritage that have inspired twenty-five centuries of thinkers, creators, rulers, and ordinary people who looked backwards at the mistakes and achievements of the past for wisdom and direction in the present.
Many charge that learning such tales in the Digital Age is anachronistic at best and exclusionary at worst. But there is undeniably something transcendent about them, a special quality that explains Rome’s unique ability to capture the hearts and souls of luminaries from every time and place, from Dante to Gibbon to Toni Morrison.
Studying the history of ancient Rome ought not to be an exercise in self-flagellation, in which one allows the often-savage realities of the ancient world to overshadow the innovations and triumphs of an extraordinary time. Instead, it ought to be a celebration of the grandeur that was Rome, imperfections and all, and a recognition of the seminal role she played in shaping the West.
And so without further ado I present the traditional and mythological history of Ancient Rome from its founding to its fall in three parts.
On April 21, 753 BC, the twins Romulus and Remus stood atop a rather unremarkable Italian hillock — it was known as the “Palatine” — and founded a small settlement that would rise to become one of the most dominant and lasting empires in world history. This ten-part survey briefly traces the traditional and legendary history of Rome, over the course of which I shall attempt to answer the crucial question: how did a diminutive encampment on the Palatine rise to global dominance, and what became of its grandeur?
Our story begins at Troy. According to legend, in the 1200s BC a titanic struggle was waged between the Greeks and the Trojans, inhabitants of a city known as Troy upon the Dardanelles in modern-day Turkey. The cause of the war was divine; three of the most prominent goddesses in the Greek pantheon (Hera, queen of the gods; Athena, goddess of wisdom; and Aphrodite, goddess of sexual love) found themselves in the midst of a passionate disagreement over who was the most beautiful. To settle their dispute, Zeus (king of the gods) appointed Paris, a Trojan prince, as judge. Attempting to sway Paris, each of the three goddesses offered him a precious reward should he choose her, but it was Aphrodite’s offer — that he be wed to Helen, wife of a Greek king called Menelaus — that was most convincing to the Trojan squire. Her promise was swiftly delivered upon, and Helen was spirited away from the court of Menelaus to the high walls of Priam, king of Troy.
War followed forthwith, as Greeks hastened to Troy to support Menelaus and reclaim his snatched wife from Paris. The fighting was intense, lengthy, and heroic — much of it is retold in Homer’s Iliad, most especially the exploits of a Greek general named Achilles. At last, supported by many of the gods and aided by cunning trickery in the “Trojan Horse” (a fake peace offering that in fact contained Greek soldiers within its belly, allowing the marauders to flood the city by night and open its gates to the invaders waiting outside), the Greeks breached the walls, and began to pillage and burn.
From the carnage escaped a particular Trojan prince — Aeneas, a son of Venus — accompanied by a retinue of comrades. In search of friendly lands and a place to found a new city, he set out from Troy by ship and, after an arduous journey, arrived on the shores of North Africa to a city called Carthage (modern-day Tunis), the home of Queen Dido. The people were friendly, milk and honey flowed, and, most notoriously, Dido and Aeneas fell into the throngs of love for one another, a rather scandalous affair for the previously-unbetrothed Dido and the now-uxorious Aeneas. Alas, this was not to be the Romans’ final home; for Hermes, the messenger god, flitted down to Aeneas, whom he found strutting bejeweled atop the high walls of Carthage, and bore to him a fateful message from Zeus himself: Aeneas must head to Latium (the region of Italy around modern-day Rome), as was his fate. Immediately, devoted Aeneas (or pius Aeneas, as goes the famous Latin phrase) set out, and soon reaches Latium. However, his departure was not casualty-free; in a fit of woeful despair at seeing her lover gone, Dido stabbed herself to death, leaving a final curse on the Trojans that shall reappear later in this survey. Much of the tale of Aeneas’ journey to Rome, it should be noted, is retold in Vergil’s Aeneid.
Thus we conclude the first chapter of Rome’s history, with Trojan ships on Latian sands.
Having shored in Italy, “Aeneas f[ound] not peace but another terrible war” (Ragan, Survey). A local king, Latinus, sparked conflict when he betrothed his daughter Lavinia to the newly arrived Aeneas instead of the man to whom he had already promised her, Turnus. In the ensuing strife, in which the Trojan-Latinus coalition fought Turnus and his local allies, Aeneas slew Turnus and subsequently married Lavinia. He died in another skirmish shortly afterward.
Aeneas’ body was never recovered, but his name remains forever etched into the towering stele of Western civilization, a fleeting ember of once-mighty Troy rekindled into the blazing inferno that was Rome. His legacy would be taken up by his young son Ascanius (also known as Iulus). The year, as legend has it, is circa 1175 BC.
Thirty or so years later, Ascanius founded the town of Alba Longa in the nearby Alban Hills, about twenty miles east of the Seven Hills that will later mark the famous site of Rome. Ascanius is the first in a 400-year line of Alban kings — the so-called Silvian Dynasty — that ends with King Proca and his two sons: Numitor (the elder) and Amulius (the younger). Upon Proca’s death sometime in the 8th century BC, Numitor, being the elder brother, ought to have inherited the throne. Amulius, however, had other plans, and he usurped the throne, murdered Numitor’s sons, and cast Numitor himself into exile. In a rather Machiavellian twist, wanting to end his brother’s bloodline Amulius forced Numitor’s daughter Rhea Silvia to become a Vestal Virgin, consigning her to celibate priestesshood.
Divine intervention followed forthwith, and Rhea Silvia became impregnated by Mars, the god of war [virgin pregnancies tend to resurface, no?]. Amulius orders the products of the pregnancy, twin boys named Romulus and Remus, to be left on the banks of the Tiber River to perish [cue Moses…]. Escaping doom, the twins were found and nursed by a she-wolf who brought them to a cave known as “the Lupercal.” Soon thereafter, the infants were found by a shepherd, Faustulus, who took them in and raised them as his own (along with his wife, Acca Larentia). Eventually, having discovered their family background and having learned of the injustice Amulius had wrought, they wrested back control of Alba Longa and restored Numitor, their now-agéd grandfather, to the throne. Wrongs thus righted, the brothers set out, looking to found a city of their own.
The twins and their followers journeyed west to a marshy spot near the Tiber River, ringed by seven hills: the Palatine, the Quirinal, the Viminal, the Esquiline, the Caelian, the Aventine, and the Capitoline. Romulus surmounted the Palatine hill and began setting the boundaries of a new hamlet, Rome. The legendary date of this founding is April 21, 753 B.C. Remus, in brotherly scorn, leapt over the Rome’s diminutive walls. Romulus, ever the patriot, felled his brother with his blade, declaring, “Sic deinde, quicumque alius transiliet moenia mea” — “Thus henceforth to anyone who should o’erleap my bulwarks.”
Rid of pesky Remus, Romulus set to the task of governance and growth, making Rome (specifically the Capitoline hill) an asylum that welcomed all who wished to join the new town. Unsurprisingly, such an arrangement attracted a less-than-ideal rabble — the men were raucous and criminal, the women sparse. Stung by a neighboring tribe’s refusal to provide their daughters in marriage to the Roman ruffians, Romulus announced a Festival of Neptune (the sea god) in his new town, attracting scores of local tribespeople. With the beady eyes of the Romans fixed upon the Sabine daughters — the young, gallivanting women from the Sabine tribe — Romulus gave the signal, and the Romans rushed out from their hidey-holes, each seizing a Sabine lass for his own and absconding back onto the fortified heights of the Palatine. The festival, needless to say, quickly dispersed.
The Roman snatching — or, as it became known, “The Rape of the Sabine Women” — was rather poorly received by the duped Sabines, who quickly armed themselves and prepared to make battle. Skirmishes ensued, but the final engagement of the war, the Battle of the Lacus Curtius, was ended when the Roman wives (yes, the very Sabine girls who had only recently been kidnapped) threw themselves into the fray and demanded that conflict cease in an event often called “The Intervention of the Sabine Women.” Impelled to peace, the two towns merged, the new entity jointly ruled by Romulus and Titus Tatius, the king of the Sabines.
Around this time Romulus went about planting the societal seeds that would sprout into the grand trunks of Roman civilization. To one hundred hand-picked followers he gave the title “patres” — “fathers”. These men would serve in an official capacity as his advisory council, the Senate. The descendants of these early “fathers” would later be known as the “patricii,” or “Patricians.” The rest of the citizenry were merely the “plebs,” or “Plebeians.” From the union of these two delineated strata (the Senate and the masses) comes the famous phrase SPQR — “Senatus PopulusQue Romanus,” or “the Senate and People of Rome.” Another division of the city — thirty “curiae,” named after thirty of the Sabine women who had intervened — provided the voting units of the “Comitia Curiata,” or “Roman Assembly.”
Over the next several years of his rule (by now Titus Tatius had perished during a riot in nearby Lavinium, leaving Romulus the sole king), Romulus oversaw the city’s continued growth as it pressed outward in conquest. In the late 8th century B.C., Romulus died when, while surveying the troops arranged on the Campus Martius (Plain of Mars) from the Quirinal hill, a cloud enshrouded him. When the cloud lifted, Romulus was nowhere to be found — either murdered in a conspiracy by the Senators or, as the Roman historian Livy more dubiously asserts, ascended to heaven under the auspices of Mars. Romulus was later deified under the name “Quirinus,” attracting a significant cult following. He reigned for thirty-seven years, the first of Rome’s “Seven Kings.”
Thus we conclude the second chapter of our history of Rome, with Romulus dead and a new king, as we shall soon see, poised to spring from the ashes.
Somewhat unusually, the Roman kingship was elective: The Senate nominated new kings during the interregna that followed monarchs’ deaths (during which nominating process various Senators would serve as temporary rulers), and the Assembly confirmed or rejected those nominees. The arrangements surrounding Romulus’ succession were no exception; the lengthy, one-year interregnum that followed Romulus’ death saw ten Senators rule as interregnes, or “between-kings,” before a worthy successor was nominated and confirmed: Numa Pompilius, Rome’s second king.
Numa Pompilius: The Pacifist and Priest (r. 716–673 BC)
Numa’s accession betokened a city exhausted from the constant conflict and rapid expansion of Romulus’ reign: more scholar than fighter, Numa was famed for his disciplined lifestyle, religious dedication, and vast wisdom. Numa’s selection marked a successful compromise between the Roman and Sabine factions of the population — though himself a Sabine himself from the town of Cures, Numa was uncontroversial and widely respected, characteristics that rendered him acceptable to each of the bickering factions.
Numa is chiefly remembered for his pacifism and his institution of the sacra, Rome’s religious traditions. Among his first decrees as monarch was the dissolution of the guard that had comprised Romulus’ personal entourage — an act both of peacemaking and self-preservation, as the guards’ loyalty was questionable. One of Numa’s most significant contributions was the establishment of several priestly orders, including pontifices and flamines (higher and lower classes, respectively, of standard priests), the Salii (the twelve so-called “leaping priests” of Mars), the fetiales (the priests who advised the Senate on treaties, foreign affairs, and official declarations of war), and the Pontifex Maximus, the high priest of Rome. Most significantly, he imported from Alba Longa the Vestal Virgins — the famed priestesses of Vesta (goddess of the hearth) who, as ceremonial stewards of all Rome, kept her sacred fire aflame. Numa also constructed several temples, including the famous Temple of Janus, whose doors were closed during peacetime and flung open during wars. Tellingly, the doors remained closed for Numa’s entire reign. Another of his lasting contributions was the institution of a twelve-month calendar adjusted to the solar and lunar years, with provisions for “holy” and “unholy” days.
Throughout his reign, Numa asserted his direct connection to the gods by means of his marriage to Egeria, a nymph who supposedly furnished him with divine directives upon his periodic visits to her. Numa died of old age in 673 BC, having presided over a long period of peace and productivity in the city on the Tiber.
Tullus Hostilius: The Warrior (r. 673–642 BC)
Where Numa was priest, Tullus was warrior. Scornful of the religious obsession that had settled over the city and believing Rome to have grown “soft” under Numa’s pacifism, Tullus Hostilius set about renewing the military prowess the city had enjoyed under Romulus and sought to expand its imperium, or “sphere of influence” (later “empire”). Tullus waged war on several neighboring peoples, including the Sabines (whom he defeated with a cavalry charge in a battle near Malitiosa Forest, inflicting heavy casualties), the confederated Veientes and Fidenates (whom he defeated even despite the treacherous retreat of Rome’s Alban “allies”), and even Alba Longa, the ancient birthplace of Romulus. It is this final conquest for which Tullus is best known today.
Cattle begat the strife. When a small herd of the beasts (owned by a Roman farmer) wandered into Alban territory, and the relevant landowners refused to return them to Rome, Tullus did what any reasonable leader might have done: He declared war against all Alba Longa. Undaunted, the Albans marshaled themselves under their king, Cluilius, and marched to the outskirts of Rome. Quickly, they dug a trench — the aptly-named Cluilian trench — around the entire city. Soon, though, Cluilius perished of unspecified causes. [“Cluilius… moritur,” the Roman historian Livy helpfully elaborates: “Cluilius dies” (Ab Urbe Condita, 1.23.4).]
To replace Cluilius, the Albans appointed Mettius Fufetius as military dictator, granting him absolute command over the city and its forces. The two leaders — Tullus and Fufetius — drew up their armies into battle and marched out to face each other. Neither side wanting to wage what would surely be a bloody and destructive war — for the neighboring Etruscans would have looked on with glee as their two main territorial rivals tore each other to shreds, ready to swoop in and conquer the weakened victor — Fufetius suggested a more efficient resolution: a duel. Miraculously, each army had among its ranks a set of triplets: the Romans had the Horatii brothers, and the Albans had the Curiatii brothers. The teams of brothers would fight to the bloody death for their countries, and Tullus and Fufetius each entered into solemn vows pledging that they would abide by the outcome of the fight. I borrow from Ragan’s Survey to recount the conflict that ensued:
The contest was exciting: with two Horatians slain, but all three Curiatians wounded, the surviving Horatius began to flee! The Romans no doubt groaned, thinking their champion a coward. But there was method in this. For as he ran, he succeeded in separating the pursuing Curiatii whom he was able to fight individually and each of whom he killed. So, the Albans surrendered themselves and their town. The Romans, however, characteristic of these early wars, took the Albans as a whole into their citizen body; the town was destroyed — except for the temples — so that the Albans would become fully a part of their new community.
So, with that, Romulus’ hometown was no more, living on only in the memory of its now-Roman residents. A final finishing twist to conclude the conflict: the Alban dictator, Fufetius, soon proved a treacherous man. In the aforementioned Roman war against the Fidenates, it was he who pulled the Albans back from the fight, intending to linger in the backdrop until a winner was evident, at which point he would march out in “victory,” pretending to have supported whoever won. But Tullus was no fool: perceiving Fufetius’ treachery, he bade his calvary raise their spears, shielding the retreating Alban “allies” from view of his infantry and thus keeping the Roman morale intact, preserving Rome’s shot at victory. After the battle, Tullus punished Fufetius (also known by his first name, Metius) as he saw fit. I leave it to Vergil to recount the gory details of Metius’ death as he is ripped limb from limb by four horses (Aeneid Book VIII, tr. John Dryden):
Near this, the traitor Metius, stretch’d betweenFour fiery steeds, is dragg’d along the green,By Tullus’ doom: the brambles drink his blood,And his torn limbs are left the vulture’s food.
In addition to these military conquests, Tullus is notable for his construction of a new Senate building — the Curia Hostilia — which lasted for over 500 years after his death.
Alas, for all his military grandeur Tullus had neglected to honor the gods, and soon the city was afflicted with plague and famine as recompense for his scanty religiosity. Desperate, Tullus turned to the writings of his predecessor Numa, the expert on all things divine, and frantically yet inaccurately attempted to perform the rituals described therein. The gods, in no mood to tolerate such tomfoolery, struck Tullus with a thunderbolt, setting both him and his palace alight and bringing an end to his 31-year rule.
Ancus Marcius: The Builder (r. 640–616 BC)
Perhaps weary again of conflict and conquest, the Romans chose the more subdued Ancus Marcius — grandson of Numa — as their fourth king. Where Tullus had erred in the eyes of the gods, Ancus charted a safer course: his first act as king was to have the religious rites laid down by Numa copied down and displayed to the public, lest they ever again be ill-performed.
By Ancus’ time, Rome had become a profitable and well-positioned town controlling a respectable portion of Latium, the territorial region around the city. The city lay along the Via Salaria, or Salt Road, an ancient trading route that proved a welcome boon to the growing city. Taking advantage of the city’s strategic position, Ancus sent out a colonia (colony) of citizens to found Ostia at the mouth of the Tiber, a crucial expedition that secured the surrounding salt flats (providing a reliable revenue stream for the fledgling city) and extended Roman territory to the sea. He constructed the first bridge across the Tiber, the Pons Sublicius (Sublician Bridge), in 642 BC. The continued arrival of Etruscans from the north, skilled engineers in masonry, road construction, and swamp drainage, further complemented Ancus’ infrastructure projects. He built Rome’s first prison, the Mamertine Prison (which, in the following centuries, housed a number of high-profile prisoners, including Vercingetorix, Jugurtha, St. Peter, and Sejanus), atop the Capitoline hill. He fortified the Janiculum hill on the west bank of the Tiber, dug a ditch fortification (the Fossa Quiritium) on the city’s landward side, and constructed Rome’s first aqueduct.
Though more peaceful than his predecessor, Ancus did not shrink from conflict; he fought against the Latins, conquering the town of Politorum (whose residents were relocated to the base of the Aventine hill in Rome) — and later reconquering and destroying it when it was re-settled by more Latin peoples — along with Tellenae, Ficana, and Medullia, a conquest that brought loot to the coffers of Ancus and resettled Latins to the base of the Palatine hill. These resettlements, along with a growing population and increasing social stratification, helped form the early stages of the plebeian class at Rome. Furthermore, he expanded Roman territory into the Maesian Forest, seizing it from the Veientes.
After 24 years of successful rule, Ancus, the last of Rome’s Latin-Sabine kings, died, bringing to a close a period of economic and territorial expansion, infrastructure development, and social growth for the adolescent town on the banks of the Tiber.
Thus we conclude the third chapter of our brief history of Rome, with four successful kings etched into the people’s memory and new rulers from the north poised to take the throne.
During the reign of Ancus Marcius (640–616 BC), a talented man named Lucomo arrived from Etruria, a civilization to the north of Rome, with his wife, Tanaquil. Lucomo brought his peoples’ skill in engineering, stonework, and logistics; Tanaquil, their prowess in omen interpretation. According to tradition, this power couple was destined for greatness from the moment of their arrival at Rome: As they approached the city, an eagle swooped down, stole Lucomo’s hat, and quickly replaced it. Tanaquil, the “impartial” wife and observer, deemed this an omen of his future greatness.
Biased as it was, Tanaquil’s observation soon came to fruition. At Rome, Lucomo took the name “Lucius Tarquinius” (“Priscus,” meaning “Elder,” was later added — we shall soon see why), gained access to the city’s high society through favor and courtesy, and, eventually, became a friend of the aging Ancus. So close an associate of Ancus’ was he that the king named him guardian of his two sons, both mere youths. But this was a decision that would prove fatal for the line of poor Ancus.
With old Ancus on his deathbed in 616 BC, crafty Tarquin (or, more likely, the ambitious Tanaquil) sent the two sons on a lengthy hunting expedition. When Ancus died shortly thereafter, Tarquin leapt into action, making a case for his own election to the kingship before the Curiate Assembly (the thirty-tribe popular assembly presided over by the king — recall the thirty curiae named after the intervening Sabine women), a case he bolstered with bribery. Needless to say, he succeeded: The two sons, away on their jolly hunt, were exiled, and Lucius Tarquinius Priscus — better known by the anglicized Tarquin the Elder — became Rome’s fifth king.
L. Tarquinius Priscus: The Engineer (r. 616–579 BC)
Scurrilous accession aside, Tarquin oversaw a period of necessary construction, military success, and effective reform in the Eternal City. Though often overtowered by the whirlwind of reforms wrought by Servius Tullius, his successor, Tarquinius Priscus’ fruitful reign ought not be overlooked.
Many of his engineering projects became the defining monuments of Rome. He built the Circus Maximus (a chariot-racing arena) at the base of the Palatine hill; he laid the foundation for the Temple of Iuppiter Optimus Maximus (the High God of the Roman pantheon) on the Capitoline hill, to be completed by his son; and he constructed a massive sewer, the cloaca maxima, to drain the swamp between the Palatine and Capitoline hills, which would later become the site of the famous Roman Forum. He also continued the construction of walled defenses around the entire city.
On the military front, Tarquin initiated a war against the neighboring Latins, seizing the town of Apiolae and a great deal of booty, instituting annual games as celebration. (He would go on to take and assimilate additional Latin cities in subsequent offensives.) He then weathered an Etruscan-supported Sabine assault with exceptional difficulty — fighting spilled into the streets of Rome, and the Sabines were only barely repelled. Following an initial surprise attack that inflicted heavy losses, the Sabines withdrew to prepare for another offensive. Livy recounts the dramatic second skirmish (Ab Urbe Condita I.37, tr. Aubrey de Sélincourt — an edition from the Heritage Club that I heartily recommend):
Hostilities with the Sabines were now resumed. The striking-power of Rome had been increased by the expansion of the cavalry [which Tarquin had completed during the Sabine respite], but in what followed it was a strategy that played the decisive part. A stack of dry timber which had been lying on the bank of the Anio was set alight and the blazing logs thrown into the water. A good wind kept them burning, and many were carried down by the stream and became lodged amongst the piles of the bridge, which they set on fire. This was alarming enough for the Sabines while they were fighting, but worse when their resistance broke; for the burning bridge prevented their retreat, and large numbers of them escaped the enemy only to perish in the river. Their equipment floated down the Tiber to Rome, where it was recognized for what it was and brought the news of victory almost before a messenger could get through.
As terms of the parley that followed, Rome received the Sabine town of Collatia, in which Tarquin placed his nephew Egerius as commander of the Roman garrison. Following the victory over the Sabines, Tarquin celebrated a triumph, or general’s victory parade, on September 13, 585 BC. However, this conflict poked the Etruscan bear, for they had supported the Sabine effort; twelve Etruscan cities banded together and seized a Roman outpost at Fidenae, a town to the north of the city. This seizure kicked off a bloody conflict that saw Tarquin lead the Romans against his native civilization. Rome was victorious, subjugating the truculent Etruscan cities and gaining great wealth.
Tarquin’s remarkable successes carried over into the social and political realms. To stave off the Sabines (see above), he had expanded the number of cavalry centuries from three to six — thus doubling the size of the equites, or knight class. He increased the Senate by one hundred members — importantly, among whom was a man from the gens Octavii, the family of Rome’s first emperor 600 years later. He introduced many Etruscan military, political, and religious rites that later became hallmarks of Roman rule.
Tarquin went as he came, surrounded by divine phenomena and urged on by his ambitious wife. I leave it to Ragan to report the strange story (Survey):
A very unusual event occurred one night in the royal nursery. The woman watching the sleeping children (both royal and household children were there) screamed when the hair of one of the children, a slave-woman’s [Ocrisia’s] son, seemed to be on fire. This brought Queen Tanaquil who, when she saw that the fire was not harming the child, took this as a sign of destiny for the child. She convinced her husband that the child, Servius Tullius, was thus designated by the gods to succeed to the throne. Some years later, Tarquin’s earlier treachery against Ancus’ sons caught up with him. One day, as the king was giving audience to citizens, a foreigner asked to speak to the king in private, on a matter of great importance. The king agreed and, when alone, the man (hired by Ancus’ exiled sons) took an ax to the king’s head and escaped. Tanaquil, wanting to secure the succession for Servius, carefully managed the situation as the king lay dying. She would give out daily reports about this recovery — knowing full well he was dead — all the while securing the support she would need to gain the kingship for Servius. This done, the death of Tarquin was divulged, and Servius Tullius, formerly the son of a slave, became the sixth king of the Romans.
And so Servius Tullius, once a slave boy, took power at Rome.
Servius Tullius: The Slave (r. 578–535 BC)
Servius was a king who knew his origins — his allegiances lay with the Plebs, the people, rather than with the aristocratic Patricians and noble families of the old order, to whom he seemed a mere “populist demagogue” (Ragan, Survey). Indeed, throughout the reigns of Servius and his successor, Tarquin the Proud, the Roman citizenry came into its own, earning participation in government and power in administration. Perhaps, though, the collapse of the old order brought the state down with it — the excesses and exiguities, triumphs and trivialities, virtues and vices of the Roman Kingdom crumbled under Tarquin the Proud. But all that is to come.
Servius’ great triumphs were social. In a reform known today as the Servian Constitution, he organized the Roman citizenry into five classes according to wealth, rather than to birth. The specific mechanism of this system — divided according to the armor each man could afford in wartime — relieved the poorest of their military duties. To accomplish this feat, he instituted the first census, or counting of Rome’s citizens and property, overseen by a censor. This division resulted in the Comitia Centuriata (the Centuriate Assembly), a body consisting of 193 “centuries” into which all Romans were sorted. However, while theoretically granting the Plebeians a voice in governance and law, the Comitia Centuriata did little to ease the Patrician [moneyed elite] chokehold on Roman administration — 180 of the 193 centuries consisted of the wealthiest estates, granting 5% of the Roman populace deciding power in all matters of state. (This unbalanced representation was accomplished by a crafty grouping of the classes: While the lowest estates had hundreds or even thousands of members, the highest ones had very few — think of a radical version of the U.S. electoral college.)
Though seemingly unbalanced, this division aptly reflected the contribution each class made to the Roman military: The highest classes were expected to contribute vast funds and troops to the city’s military endeavors, while the lowest ones contributed nothing at all. A democracy? No. But an accurate reflection of the relative weight and import of military matters in ancient societies? Yes. Before we leer at this classist system with a modern eye, perhaps we ought to recall Burke: “A true natural aristocracy is not a separate interest in the state, or separable from it. It is an essential integrant part of any large body rightly constituted. It is formed out of a class of legitimate presumptions, which taken as generalities, must be admitted for actual truths.” Political philosophy aside, Servius’ reforms laid the political, legal, social, and ideological bases for the Roman Republic to come.
​Class questions aside, the developments under Servius extended beyond his Constitution. Legend has it — though an archaeologist perhaps doesn’t— that he constructed the Servian Wall, enclosing 608 acres and all seven of the famous hills of Rome (Servius had expanded the city onto the Quirinal, Viminal, and Equiline). For the pauper, he was a prince: He eliminated debt imprisonment and eased the tax burden on the lowest classes, albeit in exchange for a paucity of political representation (see above). Furthermore, he entrusted the precariat to its land, labor, and liberty, dividing public land and letting the poor farm and tend to themselves. He divided the people of Rome into four tribes and the entire country into thirty one. He founded a very important shrine to Diana on the Aventine Hill, a shrine that became the administrative center of a critical alliance between Rome and the Latin League (an alliance of neighboring tribes and communities aligned against Roman expansion). For the first time, Servius energetically delineated the bounds of citizenship: His Constitutional ukase placed freedmen within his classes, thus enfranchising former slaves and bolstering the citizen base. Additionally, Servius established several religious festivals, most notably the Compitalia (celebrated in early January each year).
Before we recount the pitiable end of old Servius, let us recap Rome’s status at the end of his reign. Rome had expanded territorially, occupying all Seven of the famous Hills. Her citizenry was divided by wealth, not birth. The Servian Constitution had laid the basis for the Republic that was soon to come. Rome’s geopolitical situation was strong, with alliances secured with the Latin League and the Etruscans. Freedman and poor alike were newly protected and empowered.
Alas, Servius’ humble origins returned to haunt him. I once again defer to Ragan to recount the death of Servius and the ascendency of his successor, Tarquin the Proud (Survey):
Servius’ origin, however, continued to plague him as the Roman aristocracy felt demeaned, being ruled by a former slave. Thus, Servius Tullius married his two daughters, both named Tullia, to two sons (or grandsons) of the former King Tarquin [Tarquinius Priscus]: Tarquin (called Superbus, “the proud, arrogant”) and the younger Arruns. That Servius knew the characters of his daughters and his sons-in-law is shown by his matching. Tullia the Younger, married to Arruns, was as ambitious and conniving as her true love, the man she most admired, Arruns’ younger brother; Tullia the Elder, a devoted, if simple, wife was utterly unlike her conniving, ambitious husband. [i.e the ambitious and conniving Tullia the Younger was married to the simple and devoted Arruns; the simple and devoted Tullia the Elder was married to the ambitious and conniving Tarquinius Superbus. Tullia the Elder pined for Tarquinius Superbus (and vice versa), and was bound to get her way, a marriage from Dante’s Hell; trouble stewed in each couple’s nuptial hours.] Livy puts it rather succinctly: “Two deaths soon followed,” and the surviving Tullia and Tarquin joined in marriage and conspiracy. Working long behind the scenes, when Tarquin decided it was time to act, he boldly went into the Forum to the Curia (Senate House), sat on the royal throne, and proclaimed himself king before the shocked populace. Tullia shamelessly appeared in public and, from her carriage, heralded her husband’s usurpation. Hearing the clamor, old Servius came into the Forum (the Regia, or royal palace, was nearby) and attempted to resist Tarquin. The younger man hurled his father-in-law down the steps and, as he was led home, wounded, sent assassins to finish him off! Livy adds a gruesome touch: As she was coming home in her carriage, Tullia saw the body of her father deserted in the street. She ordered her driver to drive over the body, splattering the carriage with blood, and taking the curse home. The street where this happened was called thereafter Via Scelerata, Street of Crime.
Scandal, shock, scurrility — these were the accoutrements of Tarquinius Superbus’ accession. Where Tarquinius Priscus had pomp and pageantry, Superbus had profligacy and perfidy; where old Numa had decorum and decency, Superbus had depravity and debasedness; and where Romulus had valor and vigor, Superbus had vanity and villainy. The blood splattered on the wheels of Tullia’s cabriolet betokened more than the death of a helpless elder; it presaged the end of a mighty chapter in Rome’s history. The tale of Tarquin the Proud is one of crime for all ages.
Tarquinius Superbus: The Tyrant (r. 535–509 BC)
And so we come to Tarquin the Proud, as all histories of the Roman Kingdom must, the final king of the great house of Tarquin. His cognomen, “Superbus,” (translated as “proud” or “arrogant”) tells all. Ragan aptly characterizes his rule: “That bloody and inauspicious act was only the beginning to what became a despot’s reign of terror. As is the case with all tyrants, no class or individual was spared from Tarquin’s jealousy or cruelty” (Survey). Indeed, so wretched was the rule of Tarquin that he made the title of rex, or king, forever hateful to the Romans, inscribing his name with blood on the tapestry of Roman descent. As Cicero questioned in his Republica, “Are you not aware that it was the insolence and pride of one man, Tarquinius, that made the title of king odious to our people?”
Ambition, wealth, and disregard make a vile combination; Tarquin began his reign with a murderous romp. He refused to entomb old Servius, and executed any senator whom he deemed a “loyalist” supporter of Servius, seizing their property for his own and reducing the size of the Senate. He mustered a bodyguard to facilitate his haughty uninhibitedness. Livy captures his philosophy on governance: “Without hope of his subjects’ affection, he could rule only by fear; and to make himself feared as widely as possible he began the practice of trying capital causes without consultation and by his own sole authority” (Early History of Rome). He ruled as a tyrant rather than as a king, refusing to consult the Senate on any matters of military or state. His proto-Machiavellian foreign policy was just as brutal, as when he summoned a meeting of local leaders and proceeded to execute one (by drowning him to death, no less) under a manufactured charge, a blatant violation of Rome’s notions of justified foreign aggression. He used mercenaries for matters of war, a massive faux-pas in the Roman eye. One particular event recalls his military cruelty, the famous skirmish with Gabii (Ragan, Survey):
Unable to defeat the town of Gabii in battle, Tarquin contrived to have his son pretend that he was fleeing his cruel father — something easily believed. Established in Gabii, Sextus secretly sent to his father asking what to do next. While the messenger awaited, Tarquin silently went into his garden and with his walking stick lopped off the heads of flowers that towered above others. This “object lesson” was not lost on the son; many noble heads were lopped off, and Sextus gained power in Gabii only to hand it over to his father.
In religious matters Tarquin the Proud was equally inept. When the Cumaean Sibyl, a priestess of Apollo, came to Tarquin to offer him nine books of prophecy about the future of Rome (albeit for a hefty sum), he declined. The Sibyl, a crafty saleswoman (who knew!), burned three of the scrolls, and offered the six left for the original price. Tarquin yet again refused — and yet again the Sibyl set three alight, leaving only three from the original nine. Finally, Tarquin paid six thousand talents of silver — an exorbitant sum (about $99 million in today’s prices!) — for a third of the original offering. These books, which came to be known as the Sibylline Books, were housed in the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus and were consulted by the Roman Senate during national emergencies.
Despite its many disasters, the reign of Tarquin the Proud had one area of success: infrastructure. Tarquin, though deranged, understood the mind of the Roman populace; when kept busy, the people had little time to foment discontent. Accordingly, he imported Etruscan engineers and began several massive and lavish construction projects: the Temple of Jupiter and the excavation of the Cloaca Maxima, in particular. Ironically, however, it was the very area in which Tarquin found limited success that effected his downfall: His incredible infrastructure expenditure left the Roman coffers depleted and himself in need of more funds. And so he laid siege to the rich town of Ardea. I once again turn to Ragan for the downfall that followed (Survey):
The end of the Tarquins, and of monarchy at Rome, occurred with a tragic element. Away at a local siege [at Ardea], some young officers, including the king’s son, Sextus, his cousin Tarquinius Collatinus, and a friend, the (supposed) fool Lucius Junius Brutus (his name means “dull”), were one night discussing their wives. Whereas the other men bragged about their wives’ beauty and love of luxury, Collatinus spoke of his wife Lucretia’s great beauty, faithfulness, and diligence in keeping the house — at all hours. Finding this claim hard to imagine, the young men headed back to Rome late at night to find the situation exactly as Collatinus had asserted. Sextus was deeply struck with lust for the beautiful and noble woman. He later returned secretly with a sword to force her to lie with him. When at first she refused, preferring death to dishonor, he threatened further to kill her and leave a dead slave in bed with her. Rather than face public disgrace on herself and her family, the noble woman submitted to her shame. Some time later, overcome with remorse, she confessed the crime to her husband, Brutus, and others [including her father, Spurius Lucius Tricipitinus]. The horror related, she committed suicide in their presence. Aroused to mutiny by such an outrage, Brutus threw off the mask of foolishness he had cultivated to survive under a tyrant, and with many nobles, roused the senate and people against the Tarquins. The king was with the army; when he returned, demanding to be admitted to Rome, the gates were shut in his face, his property was confiscated, and the Tarquins were banished forever. Curiously, Sextus sought refuge in Gabii, where he met a just fate by the people he had betrayed. The exiled Tarquin sought the help of the Etruscan king Lars Porsenna to restore his throne. Failing in his attempt, Tarquin died in exile some ten years later.
And so the Roman Kingdom began and ended with rape: It initiated 241 years prior with the Rape of the Sabine Women, the famous snatching that furnished the hooligan hillpeople known as Romans with women, and it concluded with the famous Rape of Lucretia. Rome was now to be a Republic, ruled by two annually elected magistrates known as consuls.
Thus we conclude our fourth chapter of Roman history. The year is 509 BC, 244 years after her founding in 753, and Rome has entered a new era, the Republic, with two emergent leaders at her helm.

“Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble Ancient footprints are everywhere You can almost think that you’re seein’ double On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs”- Bob Dylan, When I Paint My Masterpiece
How often do I think about the Roman Empire?
As a brown South Asian man, not much. I see the Roman Empire as a distant blip- a collection of bedtime stories featuring tales of valour, romance, betrayal, political intrigue, and war. However, when surrounded by the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, and the Colosseum, its hard not to think about the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire is inseparable from the life of the average present-day resident of Rome. The construction of the Rome Metro Line was repeatedly interrupted because every time they dug underground, they found Roman ruins. The average Italian’s regular Rome commute on the metro disobeys conventional underground train urban planning as it zigzags across the city to avoid running through Roman artifacts. The average Italian in Rome also disdains at the bumbling, clueless tourists who block the glorious Vespa’s right-of-way on the road. While the Roman Empire expanded outward from within like an amoeba conquering everything in its path, modern Rome is being conquered by tourists from without. And the reason for the tourist invasion? The gargantuan Roman artifacts that are interspersed with the average neighborhood in Rome. And of course, the food.
The word ‘romance’ comes from the old French word ‘romanz’ referring to the act of speaking in the old vernacular, more Latinized French. Romanz referred to a bygone era where Latin was the lingua franca during the Roman Empire. Stories written in the vernacular- or romanz- were action packed, chivalric, and medieval. Think Shrek, but less self-aware. These tales involved medieval knights setting off on Herculean adventures, slaying beasts, sparring with Barbarians, and winning a lucky maiden’s hand in marriage. These tales were a glimpse into the imagination of a person in the Middle Ages. It was a mythical adoration and idealization of a bygone Roman era which would be reminisced for centuries to come. The hero undertaking life threatening trials and tribulations to win the love of a beautiful maiden would- in this context- be romantic (i.e. imbued with the characteristics of a Roman). The ethos of Rome is giving Paris a serious run for its money in the title battle for The City of Love.
Another area where Rome gives Paris a run for its money is the food. We’ve all had a croissant- the flaky, soft package of buttery goodness that takes on a velvety texture when dipped in a cappuccino. The croissant is quintessentially French. Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite may well be the core values of the French Republic, but the word Croissant can be added to the end of that verbiage to include another aspect of what is core to being French. But what if I told you that there is a better alternative to the croissant- an alternative that we’ve all ignored over the last few centuries? Enter the cornetto, a larger, flakier, butter-ier, velvet-ier alternative to the croissant which comes filled with varieties of cream- usually, Pistachio, Chocolate or Custard. If you walk opposite to the direction of the teeming hoardes of tourists in Rome, you’ll come across local Pasticcerias- local pastry shops- selling cheap cornettos out of holes in walls. Italians line up around the block to collect their daily dose of cappuccino and cornetto right before their morning commute. The combination creates an essential fuel for today’s Roman, providing them with mental acuity and patience to tolerate bumbling tourists that block the roadways. One such hole-in-the-wall is the Roscioli Café Pasticceria- an iconic establishment that is always full, busy and teeming with Italians. One bite into Roscioli’s famous tent-pole pistachio cornetto expands the boundaries of what your mind thought was possible- the flaky, buttery, velvety soft texture of the cappuccino infused pastry is bombarded with the nutty, creamy, smooth, hearty textures of the pistachio crema. Now compare that with the croissant- a heap of flaky pastry that falls apart at the smallest touch. I will never see the croissant the same way again. The French have monopolized our consciousness and successfully convinced us of the superiority of their cuisine. Try one pistachio cornetto, and you’ll realize that a croissant is a middle-of-the-road bland husk of carbohydrates, or as the French like to say- merde.
Similar to the croissant, the pizza that you’ve been eating all your life is a lie. Pizza, once the pride of Italy, has been bastardized and appropriated by the Americans (as with all foods), and elevated to a sort of quintessentially American experience. The Pizza we eat today is what the American capitalist machine has forcefully shoved down our throats- a slab of chewy, overcooked dough, topped with excessively saucy and drippy tomaytuh sowuhss, complimented by an indistinguishable rapidly melting slop of mozzarella cheese made in a factory being operated by some poor bloke working minimum wage to mass produce a cheese purpose-built for the fastest melt rather than the best flavor. American pizza is not made with love, it’s made to suit the convenience of Americans- mass produced, characterless slop served quick and cheap, ready to reheat and eaten on the go in a Ford F-150. Italians take offense to the idea of New York Pizza. Even more offensive, are the Detroit Style and Chicago pizzas.
Romans have been consuming pizzas for centuries. Originated as a flat piece of dough topped with meat, vegetables and other accouterments during the Roman Empire, the pizza has mass appeal across cultures- take for example, the lahmacun in Turkey, the pide in the Levant, the mana’kish in the Gulf. The ancient recipe was simple- no frills, with no tomato sauce or melted cheese, providing for the best way for ancient Romans to gain energy on their long conquests, whilst maximizing flavor. Tomatoes eventually made their way into Italy in the 18th Century as a new world crop- “discovered” by Spanish conquistadors in their conquest of Latin America and brought back to Europe. And so began the tomato sauce fad. Look closely at regional pizza variations, and one will notice that pizzas in Naples almost entirely comprise a layer of tomato sauce on the dough. Meanwhile, Pizzas sold by decades old vendors in Rome include the original, sauce-less variations. While Naples does indisputably take credit for being the originator of the Pizza, there is an argument to be made that vendors in Rome remained true to the Pizza’s original tomato sauce-less form. One such Roman vendor is the famous Roscioli Antico Forno (different Roscioli this time).
Roscioli’s pizza, a very archetypal Roman kind- it’s flat, crispy, and served by the slice in rectangular form. Roscioli’s pizzas vary with the tomato sauce and non-sauce variations alike, producing variations that people travel across the world for. Their most popular pizza slice is the pizza bianca- or White Pizza. While the white pizzas sold at the large American chains usually replace tomato sauce with a regurgitated toxic sludge of a bechamel that fails to obey Newtonian fluid dynamics, Roscioli’s is without a sauce- leaving the white (or bianca) base exposed like a blank canvas ripe for culinary experimentation. Their dough- a treasured family secret- does all the heavy lifting. It’s crispy and flaky, whilst being flat with the right amount of give required for the perfect chew. Their variations include one that’s topped with potatoes, olive oil, salsiccia (Italian sausage) and rosemary creating a simple yet delicious slice that’s dripping with olive oil and can be eaten on-the-go. Another pizza variation famous in Rome, is the Pizza Marinara, reproduced best by another locally respected establishment- Pizza alla Palla.
Pizza alla Palla is tucked away into one of Rome’s back alleys within a quaint residential area. You will almost hear zero English spoken within a 500-metre radius of this establishment. It’s operating space is so tiny, that it can only fit 4 to 5 diners at once. The limited seating space is not a concern to their patrons, as the pizzas fly out from behind the counter in white paper bags to be quickly engorged on by a hungry Roman while they go on to conquer the Roman streets in their crusade against pedestrians and tourists. Pizza alla Palla’s pizzas- like most Roman pizza shops- lay behind a glass wall and are illuminated by bright yellow, fluorescent lights to contrast the bright reds of the sauce.
The Pizza Marinara, is a thought experiment on what Pizza would look like without cheese. While we’ve grown up eating cheesy pizza from American establishments our whole lives, the Romans have been eating Pizza without melted cheese for more than two centuries. Unlike with Roscioli, Pizza alla Palla’s pizza is carried by the sauce. My favourite variation on the marinara was a slice with anchovies, capers, olives and fresh burrata. The saltiness of the anchovies and olives when combined with the tartness of the capers and tomato sauce reinforce the hearty, fatty, and fresh burrata creating the ultimate flavour bomb that one can reminisce for years. If anchovies on pizza isn’t your cup of tea, then I suggest you go for local artisanal vendor Pizza Hut’s artful, hand-crafted, oven baked Pizza Margherita with a tomato sauce so generic that it may as well be copyrighted by Toronto based rapper Drake, accompanied by a cheese topping identical to a radioactive toxic sludge that makes Chernobyl look like a kiddie-pool.
Similar to Rome’s pizza, Rome’s pasta are quite unique and under-explored as well. The 4 pastas indigenous to Rome are: The Cacio E Pepe (Cheese and Pepper), Carbonara, Amatriciana and alla Gricia. What all these dishes have in common is the heavy-handed use of pepper to create nutty, mildly spicy notes to contrast with the fat of the cheese and guanciale (Pork jowl). Guanciale- a slab of fatty pork meat- is heavily used in the Carbonara, Amatriciana and alla Gricia and its fat often serves as a starting base for the sauces. Carbonara adds egg to this fat, Amatriciana adds tomato sauce and alla Gricia adds cheese, creating a holy trinity of Roman fat-based pasta sauces. The most common of these outside of Italy is the Carbonara, almost universally bastardized through the extra addition of cream, bacon and emulsifying agents. The universalization of American Italian food through mass production and the prevalence of American cultural exports everywhere has forced us to accept mediocre dishes as the standard. These dishes use old, chewy bacon instead of guanciale; salty, starchy, powdery parmesan with a texture similar to a social lubricant ubiquitous on Wall Street; store brought dried, chewy pasta as a vehicle for the sauce; and most importantly, xanthan gum to lend the pasta cohesion in order to hide the underpaid, overworked chef’s lack of skill in emulsifying pasta sauces.
Do yourself a favour and seek out a local Italian establishment- one that uses guanciale in the carbonara- and taste the difference between an actual carbonara and what you’ve assumed is a carbonara for your entire life. As one famous quote goes, “mediocrity is a sin”- or as I transliterate it to “never settle for a pasta that uses shit ingredients”. Local pasta in Rome is cheap, fresh, and even healthy given the average 10k steps-a-day mileage for the average commuter. To find the best, bang-for-buck establishments frequented by local patrons, ask the cab drivers for where they would eat. Or even go in the opposite direction to the tourist hivemind, and maybe then you’ll actually experience some local culture.
Walk down any Roman street, and you’ll find small, quaint trattorias selling suppli- a gooey, cheesy ball of leftover risotto or pasta that is doused in egg, coated with breadcrumbs and deep fried. You’ll find this everywhere in Rome. But it is often overlooked by small-minded tourists who conceptualize Italian food as pizza and pasta. Supplis (not to be confused with the Southern Arancini) are a small snack that are a cultural equivalent of a samosa- eaten either as an appetizer or between meals to satiate one’s appetite. Suppli can be quite intoxicating, addictive and pair well with local beer creating the ideal bitter and salty-savoury combination that hits the right spot at 2 am on a Thursday night.
We think we know Italian food. But we don’t. There are so many cultural variations and dishes that we’ve never tried, and that we’ll probably never try. Most of these dishes never make it out of Italy because Americans haven’t yet found an efficient way to ruin them yet. To go to Italy, and look for an Alfredo with grilled chicken on menus while committing the cardinal sin of asking the waiter for chilli flakes to spice your pasta is a disservice to the centuries old Italian culture that has tried, tested and perfected their foods. If you’ve ordered chilli flakes or chilli oil (as most Indians I know) at an Italian restaurant, you probably don’t deserve to go to Italy. Respect the local culture, appreciate it for what it is, and please, do NOT make the whole table wait while you immaculately position the dishes for your Instagram story. Not only are you upsetting everyone at the table, you’re also upsetting the Italians. Their dishes don’t need your Instagram story to popularize them. They’ve already refined their cuisine over centuries of experimentation.
My short, 36-hour Rome stay was eventful- I explored virtually all of Rome on foot, resorting to public transport only when necessary. I’ve tried everything Rome has on platter- the gelatos, the Pizzas, the Suppli, the Pastas, the coffee, the pistachio cornetto. But there is still a lot left to see- Italy is not just Rome, Venice or Milan. Italy is Sicily, Naples, Emilia-Romagna, Calibria, Lombardy, Tuscany, and so much more. To say, that I know Italian food is an injustice to Italy. I, on the other hand, can affirm that I know Rome, and I hope that perhaps one day, I will know Italy.
There is a saying in Rome: “The Milanese eat to live. Us Romans, on the other hand, live to eat.” The Roman experience is derived from the food. And perhaps, there is no Rome without its food- so the Roman Empire hasn’t completely died out. Its legacy lives on through its flavours, ingredients and culinary pastiches. The Roman sculptures look on as the centuries pass by. Empires come and go, and with it, the foreigners that visit Rome to witness the greatest city ever built. Neighborhoods, metro-lines, bus routes and office buildings are continuously built and destroyed on top of the ruins of an ancient, great civilization. Rome has always been in a churn of creative destruction. And all that remains- and all that will ever remain- is the food, sculptures and the Roman sun.

Part I
One of my clients, Chad Fuentes, recently said something that stayed with me:
“I feel like sometimes we romanticize the past and put undue praise on characters or people from that past, while holding the people supporting us in the present to an unfair standard.”
Yes. There’s truth in that.
I had been reflecting on something similar while watching a speech from one of our national leaders — perhaps the President addressing Congress or the Senate. I can’t recall the exact details, but the image was clear: the structure, the solemnity, the way history lives and breathes through these halls. And I found myself thinking, There it is. Rome. Different time, different clothes, same posture.
This isn’t cynicism — it’s recognition.
We, the people, love to imagine that we’ve evolved. That our systems, our sophistication, our technology have moved us forward. But have we? Strip away the gold and the marble, and we are often still functioning from the same roots. The same hunger for power. The same imbalance. The same blindness to the living beauty beside and within each of us.

“Mille viae ducunt homines per saecula Romam” — Alain de Lille, Liber Parabolarum
The phrase “All roads lead to Rome” is a proverb that originated from the ancient Roman Empire, reflecting the city’s central importance as a hub of trade, culture, and power.
In a broader sense, it means that there are many different paths or approaches to reach a particular goal or destination. For single mothers in Indonesia, this proverb holds a significant meaning. It represents the understanding that they often face numerous challenges and obstacles in providing for their children and ensuring their well-being. Even when it seems like there are no viable options, single mothers need to be resilient and resourceful, creating new paths to navigate and overcome the difficulties they encounter.
Their children cannot wait for a clear path to access their basic needs, such as food, shelter, and education. It is the responsibility of single mothers to provide these necessities, even if it means forging new paths and finding alternative sources of income. Single mothers cannot rely on their children’s fathers to fulfill their financial ‘obligations’ and give child support, so they must continue to strive for self-sufficiency and sustainability.
I cannot imagine the struggle faced by single mothers without the privileges of higher education, extensive networks, or even personal branding like mine. With a relatively high level of education, the privilege to live in the capital city, and a strong personal brand, I am currently feeling almost desperate in my search for a path to my own version of Rome. I can only imagine the challenges faced by other women who may still be recovering from the abandonment of their former husbands, having been allowed to be only housewives for years and financially dependent on them. My heart goes out to them, and I hope they are always empowered to find their own paths to Rome, their own versions of success.
For me personally, I am still navigating a path that hopefully leads to my version of Rome. I am still somewhat afraid because this time the road is dark and full of obstacles. I am still terrified because I often feel powerless, considering my age and the fact that I have a son who is still fully dependent on me. They say there are many roads to Rome, and I personally believe that. There are many ways to generate income without having to work in an office. However, not everyone can or wants to take those paths.
Some may not be able to see the options in front of them because to them, it’s too dark and eerie, for some others, they would rather close their eyes in fear of the uncertainties. If you currently feel unable to navigate these paths and want to give up, take a break, I feel you. Once you have regained some of your strength, you can continue. If you are currently closing your eyes out of fear, it’s okay to be scared. Give yourself time to muster up the courage and give yourself a chance to see what choices you have.
The important thing is not to give up. Hang in there. If you experience various rejections, it does not mean you have failed. It could be that you are being protected from a much worse condition or being redirected towards a better path to your own version of Rome.
One day, I hope you will look back and see your today as an adventure and valuable experience that you can remember with joy in your hearts. Until then, just hang in there.
I love yous!

Disclaimer: I got a little wild in this article, hide the kids.
History has a tendency to leave out very obvious same-sex relationships. We have all heard of the astute gentleman who lived with his lifelong platonic male friend in a house with one bed. You may not have heard that Hadrian was so head over heels for his lover Antinous that he declared him a god upon Antinous’s death.
I’m sure your partner is kind to you, but have they ever made you a fucking god?
The term homosexuality did not exist in the language of the Romans. So when discussing same-sex relationships in the empire, we have to do so through a lens we may not initially understand. This article will explore how Romans saw sex in general with a few notable examples.
We can only go off historical accounts, artifacts, and writings of the time when discussing civilizations as old as Rome. So while these views might be the majority opinion, there were likely severe deviations in mindset on a one-to-one level.
There was almost certainly an old bitter roman telling younger generations to pull their damn togas up.
We define homosexuality as a relationship between two people of the same gender. Romans defined sex through power and status, which means that as long as you were the dominant party, your reputation was unaffected.
To put it gently, it was admirable to be the sword and pitiful to be the sheath. Didn’t really expect to be conjuring up historical metaphors for anal sex when I woke up today, but here we are.
This could be seen at the highest level of roman society. Nero enjoyed the casual midweek orgy with men and women and did just about everything you can sexually do throughout his life. This includes dressing as an animal and attacking the genitals of tied-up men and women.
The emperor was batshit crazy, but you can’t knock his creativity. He also had sex with his mother. This fun fact isn’t relevant to the article — but I’m telling you anyway.
Nero had a young eunuch boy as his wife named Sporus, who was supposedly the spitting image of his late wife. This speaks to the more common pederasty of the time, but we won’t be getting into that here. I don’t discuss pedophilia before noon, as a rule. This marriage was peculiar but did not hurt the esteem of the emperor; it simply hinted at his mental instability.
It wasn’t until he took the former slave Pythagoras as a husband that everyone started giving a bit of side-eye. This was made worse by the fact that they had sex in front of their wedding guests. This resentment by the onlookers was not because Romans had disdain for same-sex relations. It was because their emperor was the “woman” in the relationship.
This leads me to an important point, Rome was plainly misogynistic. So even though it might seem like Rome was a sexually liberated place for its time, things were far less equal when it came to women. In fact, many considered lesbian relationships an unthinkable transgression.
This did not mean people of the time did not talk about it. A notable myth is that of Iphis, who was a girl raised as a boy. She falls in love with her appointed wife and is turned into a man by Isis. There is also the fictional story of Megilla, who changed her name and wore a wig to marry a Demonassa.
Several people, including Ovid, said women being sexually active exclusively with other women was an exceedingly rare occurrence.
What is more likely is that women were far less open about it than unquestionably powerful men like Nero, Hadrian, and Elagabalus. This is reinforced by the fact that it was seen largely as very socially unacceptable. Sadly, when lesbian relationships were discussed, it was typically with a tone of shame and disapproval.
This might have been due to how Rome perceived women and sex in general. For a woman to sleep with another woman meant that there would be a dominant partner. This was seen as masculine and looked down upon by the people of the time.
Women had an incredibly restrictive life in Rome. This speaks to the intelligence of the many that did manage to rise to power, as it was a very dangerous path to walk for those not born a man. I’ll cover that more when I get into Agrippina the younger, who was a fascinating figure and Nero’s mother.
Y’know, the one he slept with.
We can draw a lot of parallels from Rome, though their society was quite a bit different than it appears on the surface. It should also be said that several of the sexual liberties given to people were reserved for the higher parts of society, with lower social classes being allowed much less personal freedom.
Stay tuned for a more in-depth look at Elagabalus, who is a fascinating character and one of the first transgender people recorded in history.
I’ll drink less coffee next time.
Thanks,
Jack

I always wanted to go visit Rome and Tuscany, but for a while viewed them as two separate trips. But then I thought to myself, why not combine them? I had only seven days to spend in Italy, so it was a challenge.
Would the memories from traveling to Rome overshadow Tuscany? Would I be able to manage logistics and stay within my budget?
Looking back, I think it was a great idea. And now, in the winter of 2023, if someone had asked me what impressed me the most, I would say:
in Rome — Colosseum and in Tuscany — Pitigliano.
Rome Colosseum
I went inside, closed my eyes, and imagined what it was like to live in Rome 2000 years ago when on average 80000 people were watching fights lasting days at the time. Brutal fights, where gladiators were fighting with each other and with wild animals. Where spectators were deciding who lived and who died in the arena below.
The spectators in the Colosseum had separate seats with men being separated from women.
Romans did not have any problems with killing each other just for fun and regularly attending brothels…

When in Rome, See This Treasure:
Saint Cecilia in Trastevere: Patron Saint of Singers, Composers, and Musicians
A quiet Trastevere via opens to a large landscaped courtyard, which fronts this Basilica that was built over the home where Cecilia lived and died.
The courtyard is a lovely neighborhood playground — where you’re bound to see mammas circling strollers around the central Roman urn and nuns chatting away after mass.
In third century Rome, Cecilia was known as the girl who heard angelic harmonies — she could play any instrument or sing any song. She secretly swore to be a chaste Christian, but went through with a marriage her parents arranged anyway. On the wedding night, she broke the news to her husband Valerian, telling him the only way he could touch her was to become a Christian, so he ran off to get baptized. When he returned, he found their bridal chamber transformed — full of flowers and Cecilia wearing a crown of lilies and roses. This miracle swept Valerian into the faith. He made it his mission to help the poor and bury Christian martyrs, and was beheaded for his belief.
Then Cecilia was tortured for her faith, forced into a tub of boiling water in her own bathtub. She sang all…

I want to talk about a recent trend in mobile gaming. It’s the trend of desktop/console games getting re-imagined and made into mobile games. We’ve had all sorts; from League of Legends Wild Rift, to Call of Duty Mobile and even Nintendo getting in on the action with Mario Kart.
These games are not typically straight remasters. They are often altered versions of the original experience.
This means I have been left disappointed on several occasions as I download a game from a beloved franchise expecting the same high quality experience I’m used to on console. Only to get something very different.
Typically I have found it goes one of 2 ways with these console/desktop titles reappearing on mobile:
This is a game I loved as a child and when I realised it had got a mobile re-release I tentatively downloaded it expecting another second rate experience. O boy was I wrong, it’s brilliant!
Rome Total War is a strategy game with 2 types of game play:
So it’s not the simplest game out there. There is a lot of depth and freedom in what you can do in both the campaigns and the battles themselves. Given this, it may seem remarkable that this translates so well to mobile.
Google maps is a fantastic product, and one of the reasons for this is that it’s intuitive to use both on your phone and desktop. It is so easy to explore the world with Google Maps. Whether pinching or scrolling to zoom, clicking or tapping, there is no friction to navigation. Neither mobile nor desktop feel like imitators of the other.
Whether intentional or not, Total War has achieved the same thing with its map navigation. Creating what feels like a completely seamless experience on mobile when navigating the map, even when compared to the old desktop experience. This is hugely important as a large part of this game is about navigating 2D or 3D environments in order to make strategic decisions. It sounds so simple but getting this navigation right, to me is the cornerstone of what makes Rome such a good port.
Alongside the map navigation exploring the UI and interacting with map elements is also incredibly frictionless. With certain button sizes scaled up and freedom in how you scale the HUD I never once felt limited using a touch screen over a mouse and keyboard.
Now this is going to sound overly simplified but here it is. Rome Total War on mobile is such a great game because it is exactly the same as Rome Total War on desktop, and that was a great game.
As far as I can tell nothing is missing from the mobile version versus the desktop game. This means the same incredibly deep campaign experience is available in your pocket.
With too many mobile ports you see simplification or compromises made on the original experience. Which as mentioned before can leave you feeling unsatisfied. Rome Total War does not compromise and that is great.
The best part of Rome Total War is the campaigns. When I played Total War as a child I would play for hours on end, working my way through campaigns one turn at a time. Now if I have hours to play games typically I won’t be on my phone.
However I feel like this port has got me playing just as much as I did as a child, but in a very different way.
You see because the campaigns are turn based this means they are filled with natural pauses. Each turn still takes me 5–10 minutes but this time the game lives in my pocket. Meaning Rome Total War through this brilliant port has shifted from an experience I would settle into on a Sunday afternoon to something I can pick up here and there throughout the week.
So basically I loved Rome Total War as a kid, and now I’ve fallen in love with it again.
The controls are so intuitive you would have thought the game was made for touch screens and the experience is not comprised at all when compared to the desktop version. On top of that the game being on my phone allows for a new style of play. Giving me little bursts of nostalgia throughout my week.
Overall I think Rome Total War is great example of how you can re-release old titles on mobile and breathe new life into them.

In the 2000 years since Roman Emperor Septimius Severus’s reign, many don’t seem to know he was an African man with brown skin. And when I say brown skin, I don’t mean he was a little tan. According to a family portrait painted during his lifetime, Emperor Severus’s skin was an even richer shade of brown:
We’ll talk about why this matters in a moment. But first, please also take a look at Daniel Voshart’s photoreal portrait of all the Roman emperors in which Emperor Severus is featured on the third row in the third image from the left here:
voshart.medium.com
Kinda brown, huh?
The full richness of Severus’s melanin is not prominent in the light colored marble statue of him which was found in Egypt and created somewhere between 193–200 A.D. Held at The British Museum, the statue does depict Severus’s hair and beard as being quite curly. Several coins bearing his image also feature him with curly hair.

I feel like I should be documenting this somewhere. Partially because it feels too good to be true, and the other part, well — believes that everyone should know what everlasting happiness is. Even if it’s just for a moment.
I just moved to a new City. And it’s a godsend. The people here look like me. They speak both my native languages, and they welcome me with their culture. Their hugs. The microcosms in their face, they express gratitude for our shared experience.
The food enriches my being in a way I have not felt in some time. Not all of it tastes like home, but that’s what makes it so familiar. Deeply nourishing to the Ori.
And then.. there’s him. I met an artist. Full of love, of life. Of pain. And also, of beauty. Everything he’s been through shows nowhere on his being. His hands are soft, like a pianist. His callouses showcase strength, fight, only present because life unfortunately placed them there. But he still smiles. He still laughs. And enjoys the little things that life has to offer him.
He’s passionate. As both a lover and a being. He’s armorous. Unshielded for selected few. Olodumare blessed me with an opportunity to see him bare. And his soul — it lights me entirely. His rage and anger, they’re subtle and fleeting. His eyes, a golden honey. His lips, kisses wet enough to quench a thirst I never knew was lingering.
I believe that God gave me the strength and carried me through, just to bring me right here. To know a warmth so pure, so true. And know how to cherish it when it arrived at my doorstep.
And I swear on everything that I know, I would go through it all over again just to meet him once more — in this moment. Right here. Right now.
I’ve always wanted to go to Rome. Since I was a child. Little did I know that the city would offer more than pasta and parmigiano. It would be the thing that brought colors of me back to the canvas. And ultimately, a subconscious iridescence back to life.

Feature by Katie McKnoulty
Now one of Europe’s up-and-coming voices in food, Saghar works with leading editorial and commercial clients; runs cooking workshops across Italy; and has previously contributed to Italy’s national newspaper, Corriere della Sera. Her debut cookbook, Pomegranates & Artichokes, aims to show our innate similarities as humans by tracking recipes on her journey from Iran to Italy. We couldn’t wait to discover Saghar’s Travel Playbook of recommendations to experience when in Rome.
When I was born, we were not only in full Islamic regime, but we were in the middle of a war with Iraq which went from ’80 to ’88. It was very traumatic because I was literally born under bombs. My earliest memories are of the sirens that went off in Tehran that announced the bombings, and we used to put big chunks of tape on the windows so that if they broke, they wouldn’t break into our homes. We would go away for short periods of time when the bombings were very intense, to other cities. I remember very well that they had bombed maybe a few blocks away from our house, and I remember that the curtain of my room had been ripped apart by glass.
From a very early age, the first thing we learned is that your life at home is a very different life from your life outdoors. So indoors, everything is normal — you have parties, your family comes, you put on music. And then we would go to school, and we would have to wear the veil and everything. And your parents would tell you, ‘You shouldn’t say to anyone that we were dancing at home yesterday’ or ‘You should never, ever say that daddy had a drink, because all of that is illegal, OK?’. You don’t know who to trust, and then eventually you learn that almost all of the kids going to your school are living in a similar situation.
At the university where I studied art and architecture in Tehran, we had a very rigid education about composition and light. I struggled a lot in university in Iran to understand things and find my own visual language. Art especially wasn’t my thing, but my mathematical brain understood composition very well. Then, in Rome, I studied graphic design and design general. And eventually, I moved towards photography and food because I became really passionate about it.
I didn’t know anything about Rome. I chose Rome mainly because it was the Italian capital and in my silly, 20-year-old head, the capital is the place to go. This is what I thought. But when I arrived here, despite the difficulties that it has, I really fell in love with it. For those of us coming from countries like Iran, as students, the experience of arriving in Italy is very, very different from that sort of Under the Tuscan Sun experience. We live in a different dimension: when we arrive here, our goal is survival and we don’t have any funds or anything. And we still need to find a job, and we need to do all of these things in Italian. I went through hell because I was really scared of not being able to make it and having to go back to Iran. Even to this day, whenever I go somewhere and I come back here, I’m happy to come back to Rome. It grabs you and never lets go of you.
Rome is a ridiculously beautiful city. I think that’s very important to me. There are certain aesthetic things — like the trees, Roman pines that are like umbrellas, against the backdrop of the ochre and orange buildings. And the blue sky of Rome is something special. It struck me very, very hard in the beginning. And it still does. And then of course it’s historical; it’s charming; it’s got all of those classic grand things that are very beautiful. They give me joy, as frivolous as it may sound.
I live somewhere between the Colosseum and a neighborhood called Esquilino. And over the years it was not known as a very nice place, but now it’s becoming very nice and lovely — I think there’s been a bit of gentrification. It has a very, very long street called Via Merulana that leads to the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore; one of Rome’s biggest treasures. They have extraordinary medieval mosaics there — absolutely stunning. I love that church a lot. And then, in terms of museums, Palazzo Massimo and Palazzo Altemps are some of the most beautiful things that you can see — not just in Rome, but in Italy, possibly in the world. Often my suggestion to people who can’t get Vatican tickets or who don’t want to queue for three-and-a-half hours under the burning sun, is to get a combo ticket. It lasts for two days and you can see all of them, including the Vatican. It’s mind-blowing, absolutely mind-blowing.
In the side streets of the Via Merulana, there are a couple of nice places. One of them is a new bakery — Forno Conti. They have bread of course, but also croissants and cakes, and it’s become very popular. There’s a little community around it. It’s very different from the classic Roman bakery. Then there’s a little wine bar that’s quite famous now in Trastevere called Enoteca l’Antidoto, and they have very nice natural wines and littles dishes. There’s another trattoria called Trattoria Pennestri. The food is Roman but with an elegant little twist. You need to book but it’s not impossible to get in.
I do a lot of shopping at Esquilino Market. To be honest, the quality of fruit and veg is not always, like, a farmers market, but it’s possibly the most multicultural market in Rome. And you can find a lot of ingredients that you can’t find anywhere else. The African community shops there; the Chinese community shops there; the Bangladeshi and Indian community shops there. So it’s very interesting.
After university I discovered food blogs. Some of them were people who were very much like me — they had a background in the arts and now they were working with food. Some of them were doing astonishing photography, and that was the moment that it clicked. And I thought, ‘I can do this’ — not so much because I knew how to do photography, because I didn’t, but because I knew composition and I knew light. So I started practicing. It took me some time but it was also very nice, because for the first time I had found my visual language — the thing that I had struggled so much to find. It was very liberating.
The more I worked with food, the more I was intrigued with its cultural and political aspects and what it represents. So I started blogging about it and writing about it. And this is how I came to write my first cookbook, Pomegranates & Artichokes, which is exactly about those things. It’s also autobiographical, and this is what I do: I love to look at cultures, habits and situations through the lens of food, literally and figuratively.
Pomegranates & Artichokes is a cookbook that starts in Iran; then it travels west, crossing the Mediterranean and the Middle East through Turkey, Greece, Lebanon and Syria, all of those countries. And it arrives in Italy as if you were taking a flight — it literally does this journey. I love watching the map thing on the airplane and this is exactly that. I got this idea because this is a book that is born out of my experience of living as an Iranian, but mostly as an immigrant, here in Italy, in the West. This whole book is about how a lot of the flavors, ingredients and cooking methods are super similar. We’re not even that far, geographically speaking. Basically, you cross Greece and Turkey, and you’re in Iran — so how is it that people from my side of the world are treated so differently where our food is so similar? So this book is a testimony to those similarities.
It started because of the protests of the death of Mahsa Amini, who was murdered because she was showing a few strands of hair. So it is about compulsory hijab, and yet it is not just about compulsory hijab. There are many rights that women in Iran don’t have: the testimony of a woman in court is worth half of a man’s; women can work but if your husband says you cannot work then you cannot work; you can’t have rights to the custody of your child if you get divorced; and you can’t ask for a divorce — the right to divorce lies with the husband. What’s happening to the women in Iran concerns us all. And the fight against the Iranian regime is the fight to be on the right side of history.
Always window. I like to have space to lean out and look out of the window. But it’s mostly the leaning thing.
‘Via da Roma’ by Luca Barbarossa, from the album Roma è de tutti. The name says it all. It’s very nice.
Contradictory.
There are a lot of beautiful things and lots of ugly things. Like all big cities.

After a long silence (because reasons), I return to Medium (as intended a while ago!) I actually have several unfinished stories, some that are in old school notebooks and others just existing as a draft in title. So content is in abundance and hopefully I’ll be able to share more and more consistently in the coming weeks. I even acquired a tablet, with one of the main motives being more writing. In fact, my return article is related: I’ll write about a game I’ve been playing on the tablet. So without further ado, let’s talk Grow Empire: Rome!
As an avid Starcraft UMS and Warcraft 3 custom map player, I’m always on the lookout for tower defense maps on mobile. My recent search brought me to Grow Empire Rome. The name was familiar, but I hadn’t give it much thought at first. The reason it was familiar was because of a game I played on my phone before: Grow Castle and I would indeed notice the gameplay parallels quite soon into the game. They aren’t developed by same people from what it seems and indeed there seems to be a major difference between the games. Okay, enough with the fluff and meta, let me talk about the game!
Grow Empire Rome, GER from now on, is a defense game, rather than a traditional TD. As you might imagine, it has a Roman Empire setting. You have a base where barbarians attack, wave by wave, each wave triggered by you. So you don’t start a game and play 10 waves. You play one wave and it’s over. You can start the next one if you like. On top of that, there is an empire map and you can launch invasions on enemy colonies to acquire them, which sort of reverses the roles. Each acquired colony then has 3 waves of rebels you can fight whenever you wish. I haven’t bested the 3rd level yet, but I’m guessing that’s it.
You gain gold from kills in each wave (meaning you get some even if you fail the defense) plus some amount from your colonies. This amount can be increased by upgrading the colonies by investing in some gold. You even generate some of this gold when you are not playing. You will also get the option to watch an ad to get some gold now and then. Gold is used for upgrading your walls, archers, towers and units. The upgrades will occasionally have visual affects too. Units will look better every 4 upgrades and your flimsy fences will turn into actual walls with archers and towers in time.
The other currency, crystals, is acquired after every 10 levels or so, plus by defeating the rebellions in colonies. Crystals are used to buy and upgrade heroes, a type of unit that brings a passive bonus to your army as well as fighting actively on the front line. You also use crystals to upgrade your bank, which in turn improves your gold gain from colonies when you aren’t playing the game. You can also buy card packs with crystals. These you can use when invading colonies to provide you bonuses. Finally, you can buy mercenaries, which are extra troops you can use in invasions. As you might imagine, you can buy crystals and farming them takes some time (but not too terrible to unlock the most expensive hero to be honest.)
Finally, you gain experience from battles. This is earned by the General, which is basically you. You can level up and distribute skill points to unlock passive and active skills. I’m not sure if there are ceilings for these bonuses. I believe the cost to increase a skill also increases in time. I have leveled one to 20 and so far haven’t seen it though.
Each wave is basically a bunch of enemies rushing at your walls, fighting any troops they may encounter on the way. Your archers and towers will attack any enemies in their range but your main fighting force will be the reinforcements you summon. There are several unit types that will attack you and you will use to defend, sort of in a Rock Paper Scissors setup.
Speaking of unit types, there are 4+1+1 in total. 4 are the core units that you can use anywhere: Infantry, anti-cavalry infantry, ranged and cavalry. Then there is the siege unit, which is a battering ram that resembles Age of Empires variants. This is only used by the sieging party, not the defenders. Finally there is the elephant. From what I see this is only for the computer. Oh, and the heroes I mentioned above. I only saw them for our side and I imagine computer do not have them.
Normal waves will only spawn two types of units, one group after the other e.g one ranged, then one infantry, then another ranged… until the whole wave is cleared. You will have two charges of reinforcements at the start and you can use any of the 4 types, you don’t need to choose a layout. This will come handy in every 10 levels where there will be bigger groups of enemies in sort of mini waves, and their unit types will also change within a single wave. Every 30 levels you will face elephants that are loaded with hp and offensive power. Luckily, you aren’t limited to the two types of units at the start: As soon as you summon a unit, the bar will start filling and you’ll be able to summon more during the fight.
In addition to summoning troops, you have a few active powers you can use. These are your defenses (catapult and towers) and your general powers (e.g. raining arrows on enemies.) Some are skill shots (like the catapult) and others just work (like the general power that gives a damage boost.) You can also choose the ammunition type of your towers to be more effective versus troops or siege units.
The second part of the game is the colony map where you invade colonies, upgrade them and defend them against rebels. There are several colonies with increasing defense strengths, indicated by numbers on them. You can have 3 legions in each attack, which have 6 unit slots each. My legion consists of 4 main units, my hero and the siege unit. I believe the rest is to add mercenaries and maybe probably other heroes as well. Not much to do here as you don’t summon extra units and have no towers. You just use your general powers. The enemy has some troops at the start and gets reinforcements, so usually you’ll use them on cooldown to win as soon as possible. Once you take over, you can upgrade them a few times to increase the income, then fight the rebel waves whenever you want. This is basically a reverse invasion: the strength of base depends on the colony and the whole army attacks altogether.
The game shop is pretty simple. You can buy crystals, which you can use to buy commanders and card packs. If you just want to unlock the heroes, the crystal package around 20€ is enough (Germany IOS store) and a more pragmatic approach might be to buy less crystals and only get the Roman Commander (the most expensive one,) or maybe buy the same amount of crystals and just use the surplus to upgrade him a bunch. For the record, you don’t need this hero. The one you get through the campaign is pretty good and has a gold bonus that should be useful for a new account.
In the end, it’s nice that the game does not force you buy anything. But then again, I usually buy something from free games if I spent some time on it… but I really didn’t feel like buying anything.
All in all, I did sink some hours into the game in the last days. But it was also because I was sick and resting at home. I feel like I’ll depart ways as I don’t think there is more to see in this game. It doesn’t feel challenging, there isn’t much to see other than a couple soldier models and the grind is way too steep.
That said, if you are looking for something to play on the train or you know, the sacred part of the house, feel free to take a look. I did enjoy majority of the time I sank.
Before I end the article, there is another topic I want to talk about.
Now, checking the downloads and review counts, I notice that GER is way bigger than Grow Castle but since I played Grow Castle first, I want to compare them a bit.
The major difference is that GrowCastle uses the auto fight mechanic. You get some of it via playing and you can purchase it if you want: Basically the game will launch waves on its own and will use skills on cooldown. Sounds weird, but it actually works because in the end, the game is super repetitive and you basically play because of three reasons: Leaderboards, to unlock everything to see how they work (that’s me) and either lack of or surplus of will power to unlock everything and max them out. For the second, you only need a certain amount of grind and you want to be done with them. The other two makes you grind A LOT. So you want the result but without the effort… because the effort is really just starting waves after a while, then upgrading something every 5–10 waves or so. It’s not skill, it’s monkey work (no offense to tablet using chimps.)
I really, really expected this to appear in GER because the core loops of the two games are literally the same. But it didn’t appear and honestly, I’m a bit disappointed. I would love to see the final forms of the soldiers but I don’t know if I want to endure through the grind.
Despite GER being the bigger title, I think Grow Castle was more interesting in terms of content. There are many heroes and tower types to choose from and you can actually have builds in that game. Unfortunately, it looked to me like in GER you can just upgrade the main soldiers (which are out of the Rock Paper Scissors — they have no advantages or disadvantages) and summon them and only them and succeed. The comments I’ve read online also indicate that way.
So if you liked GER, I would strongly recommend to check out Grow Castle too. In fact, I would recommend it over GER, unless you are here for the theme.

We sat on the edge of high seats, resting elbows and ales on a wine barrel that had been fashioned into a table. Pigeons cooed on the cobblestones around our feet, foraging for crumbs and shards of cracker crisp crust that rained to the ground as we bit into our sandwiches. I had to hunch over parted legs to keep from covering myself in falling arugula and dripping olive oil as I ate. Mike leaned similarly across from me, his sandwich partially exposed but still neatly cradled in its parchment wrapping, a wad of napkins clutched in his right hand to wipe the corners of his mouth as he sipped and chewed. Over his shoulder I watched my romanticized vision of Rome play like a scrolling vignette, fairytale pictures unfurling from the pages of a luxury travel magazine.
Families and tourists wandered the narrow side street like a driven flock, progressing from the Tiber River on to the Spanish Steps awaiting them at the end of the cobblestone shoot. Heads swiveled and eyes swept in every direction, not a single explorer mindful of the path directly in front of them. Each was lost in their own sense of wonder. I followed the gaze of a little girl in a flowery yellow sundress. She wore a pink hoodie to keep her warm against the early spring breeze and her mother tugged her along by the hand. As she traipsed her attention remained fixed on a large three dimensional cone jutting out above the door of an artisan gelato shop. A huge scoop of pistachio gelato perched so perfectly on the plastic waffle that I imagined it dripping onto her outstretched tongue as she passed underneath.
A young bride-to-be led a parade of attendants from a corner flower stall. They wound their way around and through the creeping throng of tourists. Each had their hands full with a flat of matching centerpiece arrangements. Porcelain white lilies with long slender stalks of green, perfectly positioned and pinned, peaking out of vases the way only an artist could do. The florist, minding brilliant pops of crimson, fuchsia and marigold under a vast white umbrella, beamed with a contented smile as she watched her artistry depart. She was roused from her prideful stare by a lovestruck gentleman wishing to purchase a bouquet. I adored this about Rome, the prevalence of corner flower stalls. These oases struck wild contradiction to the bustling chaos; a fragrant reminder to temper progress with love and frivolity.
Rome was all this way. Everyday life coexisting effortlessly with the fray of visitors. Housewives with canvas bags of fruit and loaves of bread. Delivery drivers beeping and weaving their scooters through seas of pedestrian traffic, indifferent to potential catastrophe. Shopkeepers wandered out of their stores to chat and smoke cigarettes with their neighbors. Fashionable couples walked dogs and tenants added to growing piles of refuse spilling out of already overfilled dumpsters. The sounds of suitcases rolling and clacking over ancient pavers mixing with the patter of peddlers. It was a symphony. I was in love with Rome’s nuanced perfection. But no moment brought me more joy than this — our simple picnic perched outside of IL Salumaio, immersed in it all.
I’d wanted one experience in Rome: an authentic Italian sandwich made with hand shaved artisan charcuterie, layered on rustic bread with fresh cheeses and fragrant oil. I craved the experience I’d witnessed TV chefs and travel vloggers drool over time and time again. I wanted to have my own moment. A first satisfying bite that would send my eyes rolling back in my head with gastronomic euphoria. Mike was eager for pizza but Rome to me had to be this consummate sandwich picked up at an authentic corner shop. It had to be a genuine place, a place locals might go themselves for lunch. I wanted the staff to be a little indignant at our brass to invade their native sanctuary with our travel maps and attempts at broken Italian. I’d been swooning over the fruition of this sandwich months before my first airport margarita.
And I was nervous. I did not want to waste my opportunity on an imitation or weak trattoria contender. How were we to choose? I’d researched so many possibilities that I was dizzy with worry. What if we got it wrong and my vision of Rome shattered, leaving me with rancid memories of crowded lineups and the unending wail of emergency vehicle sirens? The stakes were high. This was our last day in Rome, we’d almost used up our half dozen dining opportunities in the city before departing for Sorrento. Until the hunger rumbling in my belly grew louder than the nagging for success I was dangerously close to overthinking the whole thing and missing out on my quintessential sandwich experience entirely.
We were on route to the Spanish Steps, having spent the early part of the day touring the Vatican Museum. It was well past midday and I was growing cranky, I fully admit it. My morning cornetto and cappuccino wore off somewhere between the Sistine Chapel and St. Angelo Bridge and hunger was gaining control of my good mood and cheerful disposition. Mike and I have been married long enough to recognize when we’ve met the point of perturbation that requires one of us to maturely recognize the importance of food. He reeled me in, “let’s eat.” and I was fully on board. I no longer cared as much about the authenticity of the trattoria we would find, as I did the necessity to get the thing done and put some food in my belly.
Hunger is under-appreciated by the traveler. We tend so easily to keep full, to graze endlessly and maintain a constantly satiated state. Trying bits of this and that and endeavoring to consume memories with the same fervor we use to fill camera phones. Not often do we allow our bellies to rumble and tell us we’re low on fuel. But hunger, the small h kind with light pangs and hankerings, the kind that clouds your good humor and makes you snap with insincerity can be a good thing. That kind of hunger spurs creativity and shuts up the food critic who, back home, keeps grape jelly away from corn chips. It makes us fall for gas station hotdogs and lures us to try regional oddities, offal stew and platters of whole sardines grilled with lemon and paprika. Hunger can be a blessing to a food experience traveler. Sometimes it’s the only thing that gets us out of our own head and opens us up to chance encounters. Hunger, on this day, in its wisdom, turned us left and forced us across the threshold of the first shop we could locate with meats and cheeses hanging in the window.
Inside Il Salumaio the wall displayed a dozen menu offerings, a curated list of combinations customers could order with ease. No sandwich had more than five or six quality components, and every ingredient in its own right sounded downright delicious. Glass cases were filled with cured meats and ripe cheeses. Prosciuttos and aging coppas hung overhead. The smell of fresh bread wafted from behind saloon doors and the resulting large flat sheets of rustic loaves were piled on the counter waiting to be portioned and sliced open. Bowls of sun ripened pomodoro and fresh mozzarella di bufala, marinated artichokes and basil crowded one end of the display case. Bottles of olive oil, truffle oils and an array of balsamics lined a shelf behind the counter. The hinges of my jaw twinged and tingled. I wanted so badly to touch and smell everything, I wanted to devour a chisel of gritty parmesan and secure a handful of olives to stuff in my pocket for later.
I halted my rumbling instead with an offering of whisper thin pistachio studded mortadella piled with wedges of Grana Padano, honey infused truffle oil and a large handful of arugula. Mike opted for the Italiano, a simple combination of prosciutto crudo, mozzarella di bufalo, tomato and basil. And there we sat, out there in the street with the pigeons, taking it all in. Swapping our choices halfway through as we often do. Enjoying the simplest of meals curated by chance and living fully in the moment that will forever encapsulate the memory of Rome for me. That sandwich made it all real. It fixed the impression of Rome to my spirit for eternity and I’ll be forever grateful to hunger and serendipity for this moment.
Back home from time to time, I make large flattish loaves of ciabatta and pile them with the best Italian cured meats I can acquire. It costs a fortune compared to the few euros a hand held lunch with pigeons cost us in Rome but with the best company and a lovely smattering of quality olive oil I can almost smell the orange trees and the Tiber River. I add wedges of parm and ripe tomato, handfuls of arugula and metered doses of the truffle oil we brought home in our suitcase cocooned inside a clean pair of socks. We sit in near silence together, quietly reliving memories. I think of cobblestones and a little girl in a yellow flowered sundress. I crave gelato and run my mind over the smoothly worn treads of the Spanish Steps. Mike tosses coins into Trevi fountain and we circle the trek around the Coliseum. We partake in an evening passeggiata and visit the Pantheon at dusk, but I always come back to that moment on Via Della Croce when my eyes rolled back in my head, fully involved in that first magical bite of Italy.
This is the joy of traveling for me. Losing myself in unplanned encounters, tying my memories to meals I attempt to recreate at home. I owe so much of my joy to moments of hunger and its gentle reminder that letting go is part of the experience. A part that very often leads to the greatest discoveries and experiencing the true authenticity of a place. A reminder that the pleasure of something as mundane as a sandwich should never be overlooked. The whole of a culture could be hiding in just one bite.

Me, Chelsey, and Jahan — a proper girl group — hopped off the plane at Fiumicino. This was my first trip to a non English speaking country. I was a struggling actress, fretting over if my hair was too blonde and how I was coming across on camera. Meanwhile, in the background, something exciting was happening. It just didn’t know it yet.
We took a cab into the city (90 euros — which means we got majorly ripped off. This often happens to Americans. Offer 60 Euros and no more!) and arrived at a breathtaking piazza in Trastevere.
There were kids throwing glow circles into the air, there was live music, and hundreds of Romans and tourists alike were dining on the patios of the surrounding restaurants. The piazza was complete with a fountain and an ancient church— the pious statues looking down on the raucous social center with irony. We later found out it was the oldest church in Rome. This would be our home.
Our building in the piazza had a large front window where I’d often sit and stare down in the evening. I was very far from Ohio!

Earlier in 2023, I thought of fulfilling my wanderlust and taking off on a solo trip in Europe — something my younger self wouldn’t have even dreamed of.
In my attempt to live in the present (coupled with my habit of tardily posting photos), I felt it was important to journal my experiences to capture my raw thoughts and feelings while I travel.
I’m glad I wrote them as it took me months to finally get around to sharing my travel stories, but here we go.
1/X: Barcelona, Spain || June 2023
Rome, Italy || July 2023
The day this photo was taken was the day I just did more sight-seeing: revisiting the Trevi Fountain, exploring the Spanish Steps and going around Piazza di Spagna, and marveling at the Pantheon.
I was grateful I didn’t have to take a long time in these places because the reality was that I was feeling anxious, looking for a repair shop that could service an American model of my luggage just a day before I depart for Firenze.
I knew and I’ve been warned it was not the wisest idea to travel by myself to my hand-picked destinations with a big luggage in tow. I still did it anyway, thinking I could somehow have a semblance of home and comfort packed in a suitcase.
That time, I was only a week away from home, but boy, did I feel the most alone.
Traveling is definitely fun, but what we don’t see in photos is how it could invoke some feelings of anxiety too.
I eventually found myself capping the night at Trastevere.
I’m glad I made it well that day. As usual, thanks to the people providing care and support in person and virtually, and for that night, for that rich plate of truffle pasta and a glass of wine to comfort me.
I leave Roma today to transfer to Firenze.
This city captivated me — maybe made me fall in love — during last year’s visit with my family; it’s one of the main reasons why I wanted to return to Italy.
But today I recognize how life continues to surprise us —
like that time I walked through the ruins of the Colosseo and be reminded that I used to wonder about it when I was a child but never deeply dreamed of it because I thought it was impossible to see,
but also I have those times when I’ve been working towards a dream, a desire, and then realizing it may not necessarily be what I want or need.
So here’s a little (self-)reminder: I hope that when things aren’t going how you think they’re supposed to be, open up yourself to the opportunity, and trust that life will continue to surprise you.

Dear friend,
I’m holding a glass of Aperol spritz, and this is the view in front of me. It’s a hot April afternoon in Rome, about 25 degrees. I’m wearing my black dress, feeling the Roman elegance. A slight breeze touches my face.
On the way here, we climbed a hill. There were many people around in their stylish outfits-tourists and Italians. We ascended numerous stairs that seemed to stretch up to the sky. The stairs were made of stone and they were old, like everything in Rome.
After climbing so many stairs, we entered a garden filled with tall trees. There were no tourists here, only Romans. I guess this is one of Rome’s hidden treasures. I only hear Italian being spoken, no other languages.
It’s hot, and the sun is shining directly on my face. I take a sip of my Aperol spritz and feel better. It has ice in it. I take a piece of ice into my mouth and let it cool me down.
The view is spectacular. It takes my breath away. There are so many beautiful buildings in front of me. It feels like sitting in a park with a large balcony in the middle of Rome, admiring the city. Rome knows how to melt your heart; you just have to let it. It is so beautiful, maybe the most beautiful city in the world, at least for me up to now.
There is a big church on my left and a few more on the horizon. Far away, you can see trees blending into the cityscape. The street below curves to the right, with many cars passing by. I take out my sketchbook and start to draw.
Valentine is sitting next to me. I love him a lot, and I’m happy we’re here together. Now he is talking to me about his girlfriend. I like that we’re so open with each other.
Too bad, I finished my drink. The sun is shining intensely, and there are two boys next to us. One of them is shirtless. He reminds me of a character from “Call Me by Your Name.” He looks very young and has a beautiful body like the sculptures in Rome. They’re smoking weed; I can smell it from here.
People around me are speaking Italian. I don’t understand it, but I like it. I think if I were Roman, I would come to this place a lot. And if you were visiting me, I would bring you here.
I know you would like to write your diary here or read your book, maybe Fernando Pessoa’s poems. This place feels like a little escape from the chaos of the city, a spot to sit, relax, and savor Rome.
The place is called Villa Aldobrandini, with the stairs located on Via Mazzarino. I really think you should visit this park. I painted the view for you to find it easily. There is a part of me there, you should visit that place.
Love,
Me

I found this today:
# hosts# Generate standard hosts tables.# Newnet doesn’t really use it, it’s just for easy reference.# Neither does oldnet now, since it’s doing DNS right.#
It lives on line 327 of a Makefile used to build and distribute various configurations around our infrastructure. And it’s old. “How old”, you might ask?
Those lines have been in that file for 19 years. I know that, because I have primary historical evidence, as they say in archaeology.
When I asked about this “oldnet” thing, my boss told me to look up a document, Tenwen: The Re-engineering Of A Computing Environment. It’s a peer reviewed paper from LISA’94 that chronicles the creation of the fabric underlying the network that I administer today.
In the paper, under Fixed Name Service (September 1992):
Once name service was working, we modified the Newnet hosts to do hostname lookups correctly.
This fixed the naming problems for Newnet, but Oldnet was still broken. While we wanted to limit the amount of work we put into Oldnet, we also felt that having name service working correctly could only make it easier to administrate Newnet. We therefore modified Oldnet to use the nameserver on Newnet, and quit using host files on Oldnet as well.
So, those lines date to September, 1992. I was 13 years old.
One time, a couple of weeks after I started working here, one of the other admins asked me what I thought of all of it. The infrastructure, the network, and so on. It took a couple of seconds for me to put my thoughts together, and I said, “Have you ever been to Rome?”
He had, so I continued, “This network is Rome”.
He was confused, understandably, so I explained.
Some networks are like Phoenix, AZ. They’re relatively new and shiny. They’re brought up for the purpose they serve, and for the time in which they exist. There’s not a building in Phoenix over 125 years old. It was built according to relatively modern methods, and the streets are largely laid out in a grid, because there wasn’t a whole lot to get in their way. The city was started from essentially a clean slate.
Some networks, particularly in non-technological companies, are much more like Ephesus in Turkey. Ephesus is amazing…it’s kind of like a metropolis the size of Orlando just got up and left. Seriously, I was there, and it was mind-boggling. It’s almost exactly like it was 1500 years ago. There has been no modern development there, so when you walk through it, you’re in the midst of miles of ruins.
Rome, on the other hand, is a different sort of beast. Romulus founded the City of Seven Hills 2,500 years old, if you believe the legends, and it has been occupied for pretty much the entire time since. When you climb out of an underground Metro station full of artifacts excavated while digging the subway tunnels you just left, you may find yourself facing an Roman gladiatorial arena turned into a Catholic church. The modern Rome grew up out of the old, and there’s a continual architectural history of the past 2500 years waiting on you to find it.
It’s the exact same way here on this network. The new Windows desktop infrastructure runs smoothly alongside the host database mentioned in the paper above, written 20 years ago. It relies on the host database, actually. Like Rome’s streets, sewer, viaducts, and aquaducts, these antique systems were vital to the time, and if they aren’t still in use, they paved the way for the modern systems that replaced them.
Being someone who likes archaeology, antiquities, and old libraries and junk stores, working here is a pleasure, because there’s always something new to discover, and like I did today, a rich history behind it.

Everywhere I turned in Rome, there were overwhelmingly inspiring sights, but they were overrun by tourists, myself included. All week, I purposely was getting off the beaten path, scouring the city for places away from the tourist crowds. I find it hard to fully enjoy Rome with the constant crush of tourists everywhere I turn.
This Sunday, however, dawned differently. A strange quiet settled over the city. No honking horns, no chattering crowds, just the gentle gurgling of the Tiber River as I walked along its banks. I’d gotten up much earlier than usual, setting out on a walk from my Vatican City apartment to Trastevere, a charming neighbourhood in Rome.
The river’s curvy ribbon unfolded before me, its surface a polished mirror reflecting the soft glow of the awakening sun. Crossing the Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II, a bridge of pale stone and impressive arches, I paused to admire the view. Soft pastel colours, like scoops of gelato, washed over the city — a sea of terracotta rooftops dotted with church domes. Rome is a scene straight out of a postcard.
I relish the quietness of the city, broken only by the rhythmic pounding of lone runners and the occasional flash of brightly coloured bikes zipping past me. Sticking to the eastern side of the river, I watched the city slowly stir to life.
Reaching Ponte Garibaldi, I took in the panorama again. This vantage point revealed how far I’d wandered, with St. Peter’s Basilica’s dome just a distant peak. In front of me, a tiny emerald oasis emerged from the river — Tiber Island. A bright orange building, like a giant creamsicle, stood at its tip. (This is the hospital, by the way!)
Two bridges connect Tiber Island. Ponte Fabricio, the oldest bridge in Rome, stood strong with its thick stone arches from 62 BC. Beside it, Ponte Cestio is adorned with three graceful arches. Crossing over, I am greeted by the tourist-favourite Trastevere neighbourhood.
Trastevere was just waking up. Street cleaners swept away the remnants of Saturday night’s partying. Trucks rumbled by, collecting overflowing bins. Storefronts remained shuttered, and chairs and tables stacked high are starting to be dismantled setting up for Sunday lunch. It’s a neighbourhood waking and preparing for a new day’s performance.
Wandering through Trastevere’s narrow streets, I admired its unique beauty. Peeling paint, colourful graffiti, overflowing flower boxes, ivy climbing the walls, and laundry strung cheerfully across the balconies — even the “rundown” parts held a charm.
Reaching the tall stone archway, Porta Portese, I entered the famed Sunday flea market. But the peaceful bliss of my morning walk vanished instantly. Chaos engulfed me — shouts, haggling, and mountains of stuff piled everywhere. It was a stark contrast to the serenity I’d enjoyed just hours earlier.
Later that day, nestled in a cozy Trastevere trattoria buzzing with Sunday family lunch, I savoured my delicious cacio e pepe. The quiet morning walk solidified a travel revelation for me: waking up early unlocks a hidden side of the city.
For anyone who truly wants to experience a place, especially one as busy as Rome, consider rising with the sun. Early mornings offer a rare moment of tranquillity, allowing for a deeper connection to a city.
Even if you’re not a morning person, dedicate one day on your trip to this slow travel approach. You might be surprised by the magic you discover in the quietness of the city.

Rome is home to many churches and religious sites. Catholicism has deep-seated roots in the city, which is made even more apparent since the city is home to the pope.
I visited the city last month with some students on my first Spring Break tour. Part of the tour was a three-day stay in Rome. We visited the Vatican and the Colosseum and even took a day trip to visit Pompeii. The city is filled with piazzas and pizzas at every turn. Rome breathes history; if you can get away from the crowds.
This year, Rome was crowded a bit more than usual due to the Jubilee celebration. We often found ourselves working our way through busy crowds of fellow visitors, trying to take a photo at some of the most well-known sites.
Still, we found ourselves able to enjoy the city with its plazas and shops. One thing to remember about Italy is that they are not in a hurry like Americans tend to be. If you sit down at a cafe for lunch, expect to be there for an hour at least. Enjoy your meal, and maybe a nice glass of Italian wine.
If you visit Rome, try to find places that are less well-known to tourists. Yes, we saw the Trevi Fountain, the Colliseum, and the Forum. And while these places are amazing and worth spending time in, there are plenty of places in…

If you had been strolling down Corso Vittorio Emanuele in Rome among the many exclusive shops and charming sidewalk cafes on a sunny Sunday afternoon a few years ago, you might have seen eight well-dressed, middle-aged-to-elderly people slugging, kicking, cursing, and wrestling each other on the sidewalk, as a small crowd looked on.
Utterly unprepared for a street brawl, four American tourists and an Italian family sprang into what can only be called clumsy, slapstick, stop-the-chaos-at-any-cost, WHAT-THE-F*CK?!, schoolyard defense mode.
I know because I was one of them.
Until then, it had been a relaxing Italian vacation with my close friends Jenny and Doug, and my (now ex-)wife. We had traveled to Rome to attend the wedding of some friends and had spent the subsequent couple of weeks touring around Italy together on holiday.
We’d had a wonderful time driving aimlessly around in a toy-size rental car playing archeologists to Italy’s hieroglyphic road signs.
We’d marveled at paintings of naked people and mythological heroes in museums and did all we could to assist the natives in their efforts to vanquish the copious amounts of red wine and pasta the country…

“Take the first steps in faith. You do not have to see the whole staircase.” Martin Luther King Jr.
The Spanish Steps are one of the most recognizable places in the Eternal City. This place became popular long before the advent of mass tourism. At the beginning of the 16th century, the first hotels were built here, and in the 17th century, Spain acquired the Monaldeschi Palace and turned the building into an embassy. From that moment on, the square began to be called Spanish.
The stairs were paid for by a French diplomat, Étienne Gueffier, who thought it would be a great idea to connect The Spanish Square Piazza di Spagna to the French Santissima Trinita dei Monti church as a symbol of unity between Spain and France.
Did you ever count the steps by running up and down the stairs? I counted 270 steps during my round trip from the street level to the top and back — until a local policeman, carabinieri, tried to stop me.
They could not catch up and yelled at me not to run up the stairs. I giggled like a schoolgirl caught running by a principal.
As I ran the stairs, I remembered Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck sitting together on the Spanish Steps in their movie Roman Holiday. Watching Hollywood movies was how I learned European geography as a little girl.

Do you ever get the spooky feeling that the world at large is reacting to your personal choices? Not too long ago I finished reading Mary Beard’s SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome for the first time, and no sooner had I put the book down than it came to my attention that a brand new Nero exhibition was opening at the British Museum and a new TV drama centered on the life of Livia Drusilla was being released. I know the universe isn’t actually stalking me Truman Show style, but the timing couldn’t have been more perfect. Both the exhibition and the TV show relate to important takeaways I had from Mary Beard’s book: that Ancient Roman history is far from set in stone and we should check our assumptions about it.
The popular image of Nero is one of a decadent, greedy, matricidal tyrant. We all know him as the bloke that “fiddled while Rome burned”. Whenever I acted like a spoiled brat as a teenager, my dad would call me Nero. He’s practically a byword for hedonism. Even if you’re not familiar with Roman history, you know what it means when his name gets invoked. But as Beard writes in her book, it’s just as likely that Nero was a victim of propaganda from the Flavian dynasty that succeeded him. This is best illustrated by the following quote on page 404:

We’ve finally found a grocery store right before closing time. It’s nighttime and the city pulsates nearby, colorful walkways beckoning us to invest more walking time, to explore one more little corner. But it’s crucial to get supplies for an evening snack and therefore a comfortable morning.
Whoa, what’s this?
It seems there’s a one-way flow of traffic through this store. I’ve passed the fruit section but decided I’d better get some more tomatoes after all. My feet are screaming at me to stop walking. As I reverse course for those cherished tomatoes, I face an onslaught of busy Romans going the proper and correct way in the store. I’m odd man out, like a salmon swimming my way upstream in a sea of annoyed Italians who’re peeved I haven’t learned the one-way-traffic etiquette.
What the hell is up with this freakin’ store layout, my brain screams. Why do they have to make it so complicated? Humans can’t be expected to always get what they need in the absolute same order every time!!
My partner Eddie and I make it to the checkout line with our bounty. Success. We’ll be back to the room and crashed out in bed in no time.

You never owned the terra firma of your conquests,Or the seven hills of your Eternal City,
You were but a transient occupying space at a moment in time.
Scorching the earth of those daring to oppose you,Sacking cities, devouring abundance, and smelting gold,
Your patricians choked on the gluttony of your spoils.
Sweating blood from the souls of the indigenous,Condemning slaves to perish in arenas of folly,
You demanded loyalty or slaughter.
Shearing forests to build your ships,Swallowing wilderness with your pastures,
Fallow were your promises of justice, freedom, and security.
Buying mercenaries with your taxes and tarrifs,Burying the poor with your worthless denarii,
Your gods crumbled into a common grave.
Woe to The Empire, Sunk into oblivion by corruption and greed,
Destiny is never kind to the likes of you!

Italy has always been my dream destination as I grew up watching Bollywood movies where many Italian places like the Colosseum, Venice, and the Leaning Tower of Pisa are shown. During my work assignment in Switzerland, I had the incredible opportunity to explore this beautiful country in just three days. Starting from Zurich, my journey took me to Milan, Venice, Pisa, and Rome. Even though my schedule was tight, this trip was unforgettable where I was lucky to see stunning places and have delightful moments.
Let me take you through my whirlwind Italian 3-day trip.

Flo is one of the first to enter the city after Nazis retreat
My mother and Audie Murphy ch. 15
The city of Rome was liberated by Allied troops June 4, 1944. Flo got to Rome the next day, June 5. She told me she was proud to come into the city with General Mark Clark and the U.S. 5th Army. The Third Division had taken big hits in battles at Anzio and on the Italian coast. Rome would be an easy victory, a source of prestige for the leaders and pride for infantrymen recovering from those battles. Later, historians and Allied commanders agreed that Clark’s decision to march into Rome instead of cutting off a large part of the retreating German army was a major blunder, extending the war for maybe another year. In any case, the liberation of Rome was overshadowed by the D-Day landings on the beaches of Normandy in northern France on June 6.
Flo kept detailed notes in a tiny pocket-sized diary. This was the first entry.
Monday June 5, 1944
Came into Rome in amphib Jeep with Frank Gates.
They were traveling from the camp at Pozzuoli, a seaside town on the Gulf of Naples where they’d been bivouacked with the Third Division. At first I imagined that they drove the 138 miles on the bombed out rutted roads. But these amphibious jeeps were faster in the water than on land, so now I’m thinking they traveled on the water. Amphib jeeps were used by the Third Division because they were training for an amphibious landing in France that would take place in August.
Flo didn’t make note of who was with her and Frank Gates, but I’m imagining all four of the American Red Cross women in her group went to Rome together. Gates was able to secure a promise from a rich anti-Nazi Roman to allow the ARC clubmobilers to stay in his fancy villa. The four women moved in soon after. The man did much to make them comfortable.
I wasn’t able to find information about Frank Gates but I believe he was Flo’s boss, the Red Cross director on the Italian front whose job was to establish ARC canteens and clubs near the front lines of fighting. He would be driving around Rome to look for suitable buildings in which to house the clubs.
Unlike Naples, which had been bombed for years, Rome had been spared from widespread destruction by the Nazis in part due to its declaration as an “open city” by the Italian government and the efforts of the Vatican to protect it, which led to a relatively peaceful occupation and liberation. No one, perhaps not even the Nazis, wanted to be responsible for destroying that historic city.
The 1945 Italian film Rome, Open City, directed by Roberto Rossellini, takes place during the Nazi occupation of Rome. It was one of the first post-war Italian films to gain major acclaim internationally.
The ARC women were some of the first Americans to move into Rome. Before Allied troops started coming in, they had the city almost to themselves and set about seeing all the tourist sights. Flo wanted to see all the famous architectural treasures she had read about as a child.
From a report in the Yakima Herald-Republic:
Life in the Italian theatre of war can be fun as well as hard work for American Red Cross workers, Miss Florence Wick told her mother, Mrs. Gerda Wick of Yakima, in a recent letter.
“So much and so many exciting things have happened since I left home that I can’t believe any of it yet,” Miss Wick said. “This last event is the biggest dream yet. I am writing this in my new home, which is a beautiful, spacious Italian villa. We four girls moved in yesterday from our dusty camp down the road and have the whole villa and grounds to ourselves.
“There is a bathroom and bedroom for each of us and we truly live like princesses in a fairy tale. The villa belongs to a very wealthy Italian, who is an anti-fascist, who lost his whole family to the Germans. He loves to do favors for us.”
High praise for Capt. Harold Haines of Yakima was voiced by the Red Cross woman.
“Capt. Haines is something of a hero over here,” she said. “Fighting in a war does things like ‘knocking off’ officers and men, but Haines is one of the very few original officers left. Yakima should be very proud of him. His own men are and that’s the acid test out here.”
The nice weather makes it even more pleasant to drive around the various areas to serve the men, Miss Wick said. Because the unit is not yet equipped to turn out doughnuts for all the men, she has had time to visit interesting places she has read about but never expected to see. Mt. Vesuvius and the ancient city of Pompeii are among the sights she has seen.
“I don’t know how long we will be in this beautiful place,” Miss Wick said, “but we are going to enjoy it as long as we do stay. No doubt we will be roughing it again in a tent or bombed out building before long. I won’t mind that if I get to stay with this grand division.”
The ARC women didn’t stay in the villa in Rome very long. By July 9 Flo is back in the camp, writing in her diary about cleaning their tent.

I posted a picture on twitter yesterday from one of my World History lessons where students perform an “autopsy” on the Roman Empire that garnered some attention.
A number of teachers asked for details of the lesson, so rather than try and explain it out in 140 characters several times to several different people, I just decided to put my write up here.
First: Obviously the medical gear is not required for the lesson. But I will say, if you’re willing to drop about $35 per class, it actually made a difference. This was the first year I added that piece to the lesson (based on student requests from last year), and it definitely played a role in helping get “in character” for performing an autopsy.
The major objective of the lesson is to have students demonstrate the ability to evaluate multiple historical perspectives on why the Roman Empire collapsed and form their own interpretation on why Rome fell based on the available evidence.
This could easily be accomplished without an autopsy — I could hand them sources and treat it as a document analysis assignment. But I was looking for something that was a little out in left field (those are the things that stick, right?) and required group collaboration to help vocalize the thought processes necessary for good historical analysis.
Lesson Origins
I will not take credit for this lesson idea. This is a common lesson shared among AP World History teachers. In the original form that I saw, students were asked to conduct autopsies on the “Gunpowder Empires” (Safavid, Mughal, Ottoman Empires). Some teachers also did it for classical empires (like Rome and Han China). So if you like the concept but not my execution, please go look at other iterations of the lesson. You can just google search “AP World Empire Autopsy” and see tons of examples.
I decided to narrow it down to just Rome because I wanted to have follow up conversations about the collapse of Rome based on their competing interpretations. I usually give student groups at least some unique historical arguments to help produce different results. So I wanted a more in depth approach to Rome versus the broad based comparative option with the original lesson.
I also wanted a lesson I could use in either my regular or AP sections of World History. I’m really big on the idea that both classes should emphasize the same skills and concepts, and that the only difference is the level of rigor. I don’t want the idea of developing historical thinking skills to be reserved for just one subset of my students.
Materials Used
Set Up Lecture
I walk them through the chronology of Rome’s collapse. As I explain it to the students, I’m going to establish time of death, they’re going to establish what killed Rome. So we go over the Crisis of the Third Century, Diocletian, Constantine, the East/West split, all the way to the final fall of Rome in 476. We cover the increased use of Germanic troops in the Roman army a little bit, because otherwise Odoacer does not make much sense to the students.
Initial Interpretation Analysis
I have a word document that has summaries of many of the theories for Rome’s collapse compiled together. I made it so there are even page breaks — no summary goes over one page. Some pages may have 2 or 3 different theories if they have shorter explanations. Each student in the group is expected to look at 1–2 pages and take notes on the main arguments.
A couple group members will need to head out into the hallway or some other space to trace the body outlines on the paper. When they’re done they come back in and read over some of the interpretations. What I usually do to distribute the work load is have the folks that stay in the room the whole time read 2 pages, and the folks that went out into the hall read 1.
Group Discussion and List Building
After they’ve had time to read through and make their observations, have them come together as a group and share what they found. I put the list of what body parts these “injuries” would correspond to:
I encourage students to get creative on the type of injury that they are identifying. Is it a minor issue? Maybe that’s a bruise. Major issue? Broken bone. Don’t give the students too much guidance because they get pretty creative on their own. For example, a group identified a shutdown of intestine functions to represent sharp decline in farm output in the empire.
Give them a few minutes to have this conversation, and then it is time to conduct the autopsy.
The “Autopsy”
The students lay their body outline down on the tables and begin marking it up with corresponding injuries. I show them that on most autopsy reports, they simply circle the site of the injury and then write commentary on what the injury is. That is what I expect for them on theirs, although some like to draw in the actual injury (so students draw broken bones, or one group drew kidneys that were a gross brown to represent kidney failure) and I’m fine with that.
The students have laptops that can flip into tablets, so many of them had their notes up on a google doc that they used for reference while they marked up the body.
Students are still deliberating about where to place injuries at this point — and that is totally okay. I try to be active around the room and interject into conversations either to validate their observation OR to encourage them to think of some different angles (e.g. for example, a group mentioned Constantine in reference to the rise of Christianity, because some historical interpretations argue Christianity contributed to the downfall of Rome. I pressed them to think about how Constantine may have contributed to a spinal injury … and they looked back and made the connection to him ending Diocletian’s tetrarchy).
As they wind down marking up the body, students have to pull up their shared google doc with the autopsy report and mark down what injuries they noted on the body (I have them do this step because they will often slim down or modify the list from what they originally developed as they’re actually mapping the injuries out on the body).
Conclusion
Once they are done, they take off the gear and turn in their body maps. They then sit down as a group and finish the google doc. Under the Opinion section, they need to develop a thorough analysis of cause of death. I usually specify the following requirements:
This is the most challenging part, but it is well worth the student results. They are engaging in a critically important historical skill, and rather than just memorizing a list of reasons why Rome ended, they’re actually being challenged to answer the question themselves.
I have about 60 minutes for this activity. Usually students start formulating their conclusion but need time the next day to finish. I use this as a pivot to discuss the next day and then introduce the Byzantines.

I’ve never been to Rome, but I know that I struggle with crowded places, and how the crowds don’t seem to change much even out of season in many tourist spots. Rome definitely sounds like a once only experience!

I traveled through Europe, and I’ve been home a month now. Contrary to what I’d expected, my time away only made me more acutely aware of just how beautiful it is here… this little piece of California, where I grew up.
Not that the things I saw in Europe were any less beautiful. No; there, I saw things I could never have imagined, things that took my breath away with their utter unexpectedness and newness (oldness, really, but all new to me). But I think I’ve come back with a kinder, more appreciative eye. I got in the habit, while traveling, of perceiving the wonder in everything; now, when I look around the place where I grew up, I’m pausing more to reflect, to capture memories as if with a camera, and not forget.
Here, at home, the hills are a deep green this time of year; we’re starting to get a few of those summery days that are just barely too hot, but then perfect all evening long; children are riding their bicycles in the street and laughing like they can feel the school year coming to its end. The other day, I walked by a big Mexican bush sage, and the smell brought back a thousand memories of childhood, of playing in the backyard with my sisters long after dark, when we had our own bush of that sweet-smelling, lavender-colored plant. And as much as I adored my travels, much as I already can’t wait to go again someday, and hard as it was to leave, I did miss the context I have here at home: the memories that come with all the smells and sights and tastes. The memories of my life, memories of me.
And the truth, I found, is that one of the things I loved most about the lush greenery, rolling countrysides, and swaying olive trees in Italy was how much it reminded me of home.
•••
I miss Italy. I missed it as soon as I left it. It’s in no way very original of me; most people I’ve talked to who have ever visited there say the exact same thing. But there really is just something magnetizing about it to us American folks.
I set up my base in Venice and Florence, but did have the chance to see two other Italian cities — only for one day each, mind you, but with the impression they made on me, it only seems fair I give them their own post here. For one day, I saw Rome, and for one day, I saw Milan. Sometime — I hope sooner rather than later — I’ll go back to Italy, and make it much longer than just two more days.
•••
I almost didn’t go to Rome. I had long planned that I would take a day trip from Florence and make the pilgrimage, but found I loved Florence so much that I didn’t want to spare a moment from it. In the end, I tore myself away and hopped the train — because how can you go all the way to Europe and not see Rome? — and I’m so, so glad I did.
Rome is often called the Eternal City, and it is every bit deserving of such a grandiose name. As I walked through the busy downtown, observing the perfect coexistence of ancient ruins, modern buildings, and everything in between, I felt that there really was something eerily eternal about this place. Structures from 2,000 years ago stand as though nothing ever changed, utterly undeterred by the passage of time, the rising and falling of empires and regimes, the growth of a whole new society around them — or the nosy wanderings of tourists like me, seeking to get a glimpse into the heart of this place, what so many of us learn is the birthplace of our modern world.
First laying eyes on the Colosseum was surreal. The only thing I can think to compare it to, though obviously I have never had this experience, is that moment that astronauts first see Earth from space: a rush of feelings, mostly it’s real, and I’m really seeing this, and we really are so, so small. Because faced with something that’s survived two millennia, how can you feel any other way?
Of course, thinking of just how many people and animals died horrifically in the Colosseum, all for the entertainment of others, adds a whole other layer to the experience of beholding this long-standing and impressive place. I reflected a lot, while I was there, on our own humanity — are we really much better today? We like to think of history as being synonymous with progress, with always getting better, but we are certainly willing to excuse a lot of suffering from our fellow human beings, all in the name of being entertained, aren’t we?
But then, that’s another conversation, entirely.
As exciting as it was to see the Colosseum, stumbling upon the Pantheon — because stumble is exactly what I did — was even more bizarre. While the Colosseum, Palatine Hill, and the Forum all stand somewhat set apart from Rome’s main city center — preserved in their own sort of ancient “neighborhood” — the Pantheon is just right there, downtown, surrounded by restaurants, apartments, and businesses of our modern age. You would almost miss it, assume it was a replica or even just an especially pretty building, if you weren’t looking for it (and I was looking, and still almost walked on by).
If my hometown provides me context for myself, and my own beginnings, Rome gave me some of that for all of us—for humanity. Not that we all descended from the Romans, or that our forms of government and society were all influenced by them; rather, being in the Eternal City, seeing this strange marriage of the old and the new, brought me to reflect on — despite how young humanity is compared to most of the universe — just how long we’ve been here. Surely it’s been long enough now that there’s no excuse to still embrace the kind of violence that the Romans loved watching in the Colosseum. I hope that, the longer we stick around, we will keep trying to get better.
•••
It would be disingenuous of me not to admit the biggest reason I was determined to visit Rome, and it had nothing to do with ancient history. I have wanted to see the city for years because of a certain Romantic poet who spent his last few months, and ultimately died, there.
I was sixteen when I first started reading John Keats. Fascinated at that age by his beautiful yet doomed romance with Fanny Brawne, I upheld a thing of beauty is a joy forever (from his “Endymion”) as a life motto, and longed to write the way he could. I took a class on English Romanticism in undergrad and felt almost like I was “cheating” on Keats with how much I unexpectedly ended up loving Coleridge’s work; still, “Ode to a Nightingale” reigned supreme as my favorite poem (it’s still way up there). And since I discovered him, I’ve been troubled by his tragic early death, but I really could not have predicted how much visiting his museum in Rome was going to affect me.
It’s called the Keats-Shelley House — as it’s dedicated not just to Keats but to all the Romantic writers, including Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley. The rosy-orange house stands, quiet and unassuming, right beside the Spanish Steps. When Keats began to deteriorate, his doctors sent him out of England to take the warmer climate in Rome, hoping that would restore him to health; he moved into this house in late 1820. He was dead in four months. He was 25.
When I first read Keats, at 16 years old, 25 sounded almost old to me. Now, I’m 25. And God, his life was only starting. Many scholars say that had he lived longer, he would have surpassed Shakespeare as the best and most prolific writer in the English language. He was a baby.
When I visited the museum, I got to see the room where he died. It’s small, with a fireplace, a desk, a bed, and two little windows, one of which overlooks the Spanish Steps. His illness did not deter him from enjoying the view, and he liked to look out at all the activity below, especially the bubbling clear waters of the square’s boat fountain (which is still there today). He died of tuberculosis, though his doctors resisted that diagnosis until the very end; and as a result, he was refused ample pain medication, and died suffering, terribly. That was really, really hard to learn, especially while standing in the same room where it all happened. I felt, suddenly, a little sick, and I wanted to cry, but I couldn’t.
But it isn’t fair to remember him, or anyone, just for his death. The museum does an excellent job of reminding visitors who Keats and his contemporaries were — that, though now they are all gone, they were once full of the gorgeous vibrancy of life, and created beautiful art that will never, ever die.
I learned that, despite the image we have today of a perpetually fragile and delicate Keats, he was a scrappy little guy in school, getting into many a fistfight before he discovered what good outlets reading and writing were. I learned how much he loved his siblings — he was the oldest, like me — and how much it devastated him when his little brother, Tom, died of tuberculosis at 19 (John had nursed him, as these were, of course, days before it was known to be contagious). I learned that, before he went to Rome to die, he charged his fiancée Fanny and his younger sister to always stay in touch, so they would have each other; and I learned that the two women did, and remained best friends for the rest of their long lives. I even saw a lock of his hair, and learned that despite my own vision of John Keats as a brooding brunette, he was, in fact, a towhead blonde.
Hardly anyone left that museum with a dry eye. It’s not easy subject matter, and they do an incredible job making it all come alive and feel real. But I left feeling hopeful, in a way, because what an incredible thing it is that so many people are still impacted by his story, and his art.
One older Italian woman, who was visiting at the same time as me, kept clutching her chest and rhapsodically saying, “oh, me amo Keats, me amo Keats.” I hope that, somehow, the wonder of the Eternal City allowed him to hear that, and to know how much he means.
•••
Perhaps knowing how reluctant I was to leave Italy, the universe conspired to keep me there an extra day. My plan to visit Bern, the capital of Switzerland, was foiled by weekend rail strikes on ItaliaRail, and I ended up stranded for a night in Milan.
It was quite the stroke of luck, because I absolutely loved Milan. More similar to Berlin than anywhere I visited in Italy, this city was like a hub of art, youth culture, and progressive modernity. I walked to the canal in the late afternoon to soak in the last light; there were young people smoking cigarettes atop brick walls covered in graffiti, and a street market full of vendors selling handmade gifts. I bought a pair of earrings for my sister, then wandered until after dark, trying to savor my last few hours here… this country I had come to love so much.
•••
Indeed, Italy was somewhere I had always known that I would love, but I guess I couldn’t have imagined how much. At the Keats-Shelley House, there was a list of American and British artists, writers, and thinkers who, at one point or another, made Rome their home, and it just went on and on. Longfellow, Dickens, Alcott, Browning, Copley, Ruskin. Keats, of course, though I know he must have wished it was under happier circumstances; still, he loved that view of the Spanish Steps, so much.
There’s just something about you, Italy, that inspires one to create, I think — and to make oneself at home. How else would I still be writing about you a month-and-a-half later, still thinking of you when I see my own home’s green hills, rolling countrysides, and olive trees?
•••
ROME
Activities: Visit the Colosseum and the Roman Forum (tip: plan ahead! the lines were excruciatingly long, and I didn’t have time to go in; buy tickets online so you can skip the lines). See the Trevi Fountain (tip: go in the morning, before the crowds arrive, or else you may have trouble even seeing much of that gorgeous, cool, clear water!). Go to the Keats-Shelley House and the Spanish Steps (this museum was so impactful and beautiful, and all in English; and the Spanish Steps are like their own separate world within Rome, just a gorgeous neighborhood).
My Best Meal: I only ate once in Rome, stopping in a little grocery and grabbing a salame and fontina panini. But let me tell you! That was one delicious panini. As with everywhere in Italy, there are a thousand restaurants every where you look and everyone is guaranteed to be amazing; wander off the main tourist tracks to find somewhere more affordable.
MILAN
My Hostel: QUO Milano / Cost: about 25 euros a night / Recommend?: Yes! Great common area, cute decor, nice room (we had our own bathroom, as well), and very affordable. It’s a tram ride from the train station, but all the main points of interest in the city are walking distance.
Activities: Go see the Milan Cathedral, walk by the canal, look closely at the street art, and talk to people (everyone was so kind in Milan).
My Best Meal: A Sicilian cannoli! One of the best desserts I had the entire trip. Stop into any given bakery as you walk the city, and I promise it will be delicious.

In my last article, I wrote about getting from FCO (Rome’s largest Airport) to Termini (Rome’s central train station which also serves as a major hub for Rome’s public transportation).
Of course, it leaves the question, “What if I arrive in Rome at the CIA (Ciampino Airport)?”
Great question, reader!
If you’re not familiar with budget flights by low-cost carriers like RyanAir, EasyJet, and the no-longer-bankrupt Norwegian Airlines, then let me offer a small introduction.
Your friend told you that they found a $5 flight from Paris to Berlin. “Crazy,” you think.
Then you go to Skyscanner (affiliate link) and find out that isn’t such a stretch.
In fact, I found an $11 flight from Paris’s BVA to Tangier, Morocco leaving October 13, 2022. This is just one of many examples.
“What a deal!” you think.

""Let me tell you about Rome, my beloved Roma, so ancient she is called eternal, the city that has always been and will always be. Assured of her own magnificence, her venerable significance, she does not seek comparison - and yet I find it almost impossible not to compare her.""
This is the opening of Mark Lamprell’s The Lovers' Guide to Rome and I fell in love with these words immediately. I was compelled to read them aloud, they have a wonderful lyrical quality to them.
Have you ever been to Rome? The author’s note says this novel was written outdoors, around the streets and piazzas of Rome and it shows. There is a lovely liveliness and intimacy in the treatment of these locations that took me right back there amongst the stone angels and gelato stands.
This book was given to me with the description that it was a ""happy book"". As most of my reading material tends toward more UNhappy themes, I thought this might be a nice (and mentally healthy) change.
I was pleasantly surprised. The Lovers' Guide to Rome is a lovely, breezy, sunlit romp through the streets of Roma, as comfortable and cheerful as the best rom-coms, but beautifully written, with descriptions that make you want to read them aloud. I found the cast of characters engaging, with enough about them to be curious about and sympathise with, to make me want to read on.
I zipped through the first half on this on a two hour train journey and it was ideal for the task. Because you shouldn't have to put up with poorly written junk just because you're in the mood for something light!

I was in Rome standing outside St. Peter’s basilica when a thought crossed my mind: Am I entering a church or a museum? I was perfectly at bliss standing in line to enter one of the most famous architecture in the world. As I wandered through its interior, the more confused I was. Can this be considered as an art gallery? I had musings in my head to fill a notebook.
I had little knowledge about the church. I was astounded to discover it has eight chapels, 24 altars, and about 40 statues. I was bowled over by its grandeur. The moment I looked up, it was hard to look down. Why would you? The hymns and prayers seemed to be coming from above.
Two reasons drew me to the place. One was the movie ‘Da Vinci Code’ starring Tom Hanks as the lead Robert Langdon; the other was my running away from my problems.
Though I was raised with an amalgamation of Islam, Catholicism, Hindu and Buddhism, the basilicas in Rome offered me comfort that remains inexplicable. They called to me. Maybe it was the beauty of their architecture that drew me to them like a moth to a flame. Some questions are best left unanswered.
All I knew was I had made it to Rome. I was finally at bliss looking up 60 feet towards the…

Get a good data plan. We used Google Maps to get around EVERYWHERE. So much simpler than asking people for directions. Google Maps tells you which station to walk to, which subway line/bus to board, how long until the next train/bus arrives and how much time it will take you to reach your destination. You can either apply for a local SIM or check with your existing mobile services provider about international roaming plans (we used Airtel, and took their 30-day plan).
Learn how to say ‘please’, ‘thank you’, ‘you’re welcome’, ‘excuse me’ and ‘sorry’ in the local language. Don’t bother walking around with a dictionary — nobody expects you to master a whole new language. However, people are appreciative of the fact that you can respond in a language they understand — especially when you find you have to push your way through a crowd when your train arrives at the stop you need to get off at (‘pardon, pardon, PARDON’). Once you’ve taught yourself the words, they will roll off your tongue automatically in the appropriate situation because you’ll hear people using them all around you.
Invest in travel passes. All three cities we visited had various options (1-day, 3-day and 7-day passes) that we could use for unlimited trips across different modes of transport including buses, trams, subway and local trains. This makes so much financial sense and saves you the pain of having to buy a ticket for each trip you make. In Rome and Berlin, we had to validate the pass for the first trip after which we just had to make sure we had it with us in case ticket checkers came by. In Paris, we had to validate the ticket each time we entered a subway station/ boarded a bus.
Plan out which attractions/sights are most important to YOU. There are just so many options today. Sure you can get on a bus and do the highlights, but that doesn’t work for everyone. I desperately wanted to visit the Palace of Versailles and that’s often not on a typical ‘what to see in Paris in 3 days’ list. We also managed to get tickets to a Katy Perry show in Berlin (we booked these about a month and a half before we actually left India!). I would have also loved to do a food tour, but we just didn’t have the time.
Have a rough idea of the top 3–4 things you want to do/see/experience well in advance. There are so many advantages to planning ahead. In a lot of cases, you can pre-book entrance tickets and print them out at home to save yourself time and money. This is super critical in cases like visiting the Eiffel Tower. You’ll see tons of ads from private operators charging you the sun, moon and stars for a visit to the second-floor or summit. If you plan ahead (and here I literally mean a month or two ahead), you can pre-book your Eiffel Tower experience for a fraction of the cost AND you can skip the long wait lines. Through this official site, tickets to the second floor (with lift access) cost 16 euros per head — that’s about $18 USD. A quick search for a private-operator led tour on Viator shows that this same experience costs $52. We managed to book afternoon tickets to the second floor (lift access) through the official site and it was totally worth it.
Same thing for our tour of the Colosseum in Rome. I was hell bent on booking the underground tour (with access to the arena floor) because I knew how much G loved ‘The Gladiator’, but the private-operator led tours were outrageously expensive. Then, I stumbled on this helpful post in a forum which led to the Colosseum’s own booking portal. Again — you need to book these well in advance because they sell out super quick but if you’re lucky (like me) you can book this amazing experience for an super price!
Sign up for a walking tour (or two). We signed up for Sandeman’s FREE tour of Paris and enjoyed it so much that we signed up for a paid walking tour of the Montmartre neighbourhood the next day. These are often a couple of hours long, so make sure you wear comfortable clothing (preferably layers that you can take off/put on depending on the weather) and very comfortable footwear! Walking tours are simply the best way to see a place, and if you do them early on in your trip, you can decide on which places you may want to come back see in more detail. Plus, they’re pretty reasonably priced.
Pre-download free audio guide applications and content. Wherever we didn’t employ the services of a guide, we used Rick Steve’s free walking tour app on our iPhones. His audio guides are informative and interesting — for instance, I discovered (through one of content pieces in the Berlin walking tour guide) that Michael Jackson’s infamous ‘dangling baby’ incident happened at the balcony of a room at the Hotel Adlon just outside The Brandenburg Gate! The other smart decision we made was downloading all the apps and app content offered by The Palace of Versailles (including audio guides for the Trianons and the Gardens). You actually get an audio guide device with your ticket, but it’s a tiny recorder like device with no earphones and the apps actually have the same content but in better quality. Also, the audio guide offered with the ticket doesn’t cover the Trianons and Gardens. Another tip at Versailles? Buy a round trip ticket for the Petit Train. Otherwise, you’ll have to spend an inordinate amount of time walking from the Palace, across the gardens and grounds to the Grand Trianon and then the Petit Trianon.
And perhaps my most important piece of advice:
Choose your travel partner wisely. I’m incredibly lucky to have found a partner who loves discovering new things (be it food, drinks or experiences) at the same pace as I do. He gives me the lead to do the planning, and I thrive in this role :) And then he surprises me with things like spontaneous tickets to a show at the Moulin Rouge and so much more. So thank you, G, for being the amazing person that you are! Here’s to more adventures together ❤
Other little bits of advice:
> Figure out the tipping culture — carry a few Euros in change for this> Carry a small backpack with your water, an umbrella, sunscreen, your passport (safely tucked away), and some money (our credit cards worked everywhere) aside from other essentials (charger, tissues etc). Your bag will be screened at most attractions, so don’t carry too many electronics or too large a bag> Watch out for street vendors/hawkers trying to get you buy stuff by catching you off guard (like by giving you a high-five and shoving something into your hand)> Not every touristy thing is overrated. Case in point: the hot chocolate at Angelina in Paris. Walking down the Kurfürstendamm in Berlin. Eating gelato in Rome. The view from the second floor of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Snacking on currywurst and tucking into a schnitzel in Berlin. Looking up at the oculus in the Pantheon in Rome. The first view of the Sacré-Cœur as you walk up the hill in Paris. Everything about the Palace of Versailles ;)

Walking through the Rome Streets.
I promised in my previous article about our trip to Italy to write about each city in deeper thoughts and suggestions for a travel plan. First, as it was on a trip, I will write about Rome, then I hope you will also see articles about Florence and Venice.
If you read my travel articles, you know, I am very organized in planning and do my research very thoughtfully starting from the choices of areas and hotels to stay, tickets to museums and must visit places, reservations needed to try restaurants, gem spots, to learning the art and history of the place. It definitely takes time, and I am more than happy to share this knowledge with you.
Interested in my travel plans? Just email to see.feel.like@gmail.com. I will share them with you for free.
I said in my Planning Trip to Italy article, Rome was the city that still stands as an unclosed book and open to think about, and I am definitely willing to come back to see more and get deeper knowledge of this city.
My partner and I spent just 3 days in Rome, and I think it is a good amount of time for the first time traveling, especially if you are limited in time and want to see other regions and cities in your travel time.

One of my favourite travel writing clichés is “the city where East meets West!” I’ve seen it written about everywhere from Vienna to Hong Kong, St Petersburg to Tbilisi, Beirut to Berlin, and basically every decent-sized city in Central Asia. One of these days, I’m expecting to see a picture of Dublin with spice markets and mosques and the headline “Ireland — America’s Gateway to the Orient!”
But I have to admit that if it were to be used for anywhere, the city most deserving of the title would be Istanbul. Unlike most other claimants, Istanbul is split in two not just culturally, but geographically; the city straddles both Europe and Asia. This is a useful piece of pub quiz trivia, but also shaped the city for the past two millennia — Istanbul, for most of its history, was the most strategically important city on Earth.
2700 years ago, Greek explorers consulted the Oracle at Delphi, who told them that they would found a city opposite the Land of the Blind. When they came across the fishing town of Chalcedon, they couldn’t understand how the Chalcedonians had missed the perfect natural harbour right across the water. Then it came to them: these Chalcedonians must be the blind ones…

A Day in the Life:
When in Rome
First and foremost, if you have chosen to learn about life in Rome by reading this blog, thank you for taking the time to do so!
This region is home to my dream vacation. This is because one of my best friends, Beatrice, happens to be a Native of the region who lives there with her family. I met her during our senior year of high school (she was a foreign-exchange student) and we have been great friends communicating via Facebook and WhatsAp ever since. I promised her that some day I would go visit her in Rome…but for now, I am a college student attempting to make ends meet to pay for school, therefore, this blog is the closest I will get to Italy for a while. Regardless of my inability to pay the $1,000 for a plane ticket, this blog will give me the opportunity to study life in Rome so that I will know exactly what I would like to do the moment I step foot there.
My goals for this blog are both personal and involve you, as the audience. Like previously stated, I would like to learn more about the region in order to prepare myself for a future trip to visit Beatrice. On a larger scale, however, my goal is to help educate my followers through this blog so that if they plan to travel to Rome, are thinking about planning a vacation, or need an emergency get away from college/final exams, they will be adequately informed about the region.
If you know anything about Rome from your schooling, it is likely that you know Rome’s history is anything but brief. I will do my best to summarize it in a short paragraph or two for you.
Basically, Rome was one of the greatest empires there ever was- if looking at it from an ancient sort of perspective. As you can see from the timeline, Rome lasted a bit longer than the average civilization back in the day. This is largely due to the fact that Rome was home to many powerful leaders, conquerors, and other highly intelligent individuals. Just a few of these include: Ceasar (his war tactics are still studied and taught today), Augustus (built many roads, aqueducts, and buildings), and Mark Antony (had an intimate relationship with the Egyptian ruler Cleopatra-he stabbed himself for her, she let a snake bite her for him-it’s a long story for a different time). In summary, the Romans were a power you didn’t want to threaten or mess with. You would only be setting yourself up for defeat-unless, of course, you were the Franks from Germany who defeated them between AD 406–419.
So what is it with the Colosseum as a Roman symbol?
The Colosseum, as pictured at the top of this blog post, was built following the rule of Nero, an extra crazy ruler who basically ran the morale of the Roman peoples into the ground. The ruler who followed Nero, Vespasian, decided that building the Colosseum for the purpose of free entertainment (gladiator games) would benefit the people of Rome by bringing up their morale, and that it did.
Today, the Colosseum still stands with a few alterations and additions after its original design in approximately 73–75 A.D. It is noteworthy that the Roman architecture and design techniques used to build the magnificent building are still being used in various buildings in the modern world.
While ancient Roman culture is still evident in this amazing city, Rome has modernized itself to keep up with the current times. If one were to visit today, it would be something like…
Vatican City
Vatican City, while it is technically a city state and not a part of Rome, falls within the Roman boarder. It is home to approximately 840 people, one of those being the Pope, the leader of the Catholic Church. This city state also happens to contain some of the main tourist attractions in Rome including St. Peter’s Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, and the Vatican Museums.
Shopping
According to http://www.rome.info/shopping/, when one is shopping in Rome, they can expect to break the bank. One positive side to shopping in the tourist city, however, is that leather products such as purses, shoes, and belts, are commonly found for a fair price. (Being a purse-lover myself, I now know I need to save up for more than just my plane ticket!)
Another important thing to remember if you are used to the United States’ way of shopping is that the hours are generally a bit off from what you may be used to. Evidently, they open around 9:00AM and close again for lunch around 1:00PM. They then open up from 3:30PM-7:30PM. These hours are different, however, for Sundays and Monday mornings and may also be different depending on the type of shop.
*Note: If the purpose of your trip is heavily dependent upon the shopping, do not go to Rome during August. During this month, most shops and restaurants close for about a two week period while shop owners take their annual holiday.
Restaurants
Yes, Rome happens to be in Italy so you’re probably thinking, “Well duh! While in Italy, order Italian!” If you love spaghetti or pizza, then I can see why you would prefer to purchase the “real deal.” One thing I will tell you, however, is make sure to order some gelato for dessert!
Gelato, the Italian version of ice cream, is made with milk, cream, different sugars, and nut and fruit purees for flavor. Generally, the consensus is that gelato is amazing and American ice cream comes second. If you are a bit of a health nut like me, you will also be happy to know that gelato tends to contain less calories, fat, and sugar than typical ice cream.
According to http://www.expatfocus.com/expatriate-rome-language, the main language spoken in Rome is Italian. Luckily, if you are an individual who is not bilingual-like me-and English is your only language, Rome is a great place for you to travel to a different country without having to suffer the consequences of butchering a new language. (Go to Rome and you won’t have your friends laugh at you for accidentally ordering grilled guinea pig to pair with your pasta and side salad-it’s a thing!) This is because the people of Rome are aware that a large part of their economy depends on tourism so many of them living in the areas known for the tourist attractions speak English. In other words, as far as verbal communication goes you should be able to survive without hiring a translator.
If you do want to throw just a bit of Italian into your experience, however, feel free to say “ciao” (pronounced like “chow” in “puppy chow”). This means “hello” and can also translated to “goodbye,” depending on the context.
In terms of nonverbal communication, however, communicating in Rome is a different story. After spending much time with my friend Beatrice in high school, she became annoyed with my “silly American ways,” as she called them. According to her, Romans are very physical in a way that we Americans might see as boarder-line suggestive/sexual. Apparently, it is completely common to let your friends (male or female) sit on your lap when hanging out, give long hugs to friends, and the custom greeting (even with strangers) is a short embrace with a kiss on each cheek.
Another way the Romans communicate physically is by frequently motioning. Beatrice often coached me (as a bit of a joke) how to “speak with my hands.” If something is delicious, you indicate that with your hands because your mouth is full. If you want someone to hurry up, you tap your wrist like a watch. Basically if you want to go to Italy and your goal is to blend in, you had better learn the equivalent of sign language.
www.nytimes.com
As I sit here and finish up this blog post (while drinking a glass of wine from Italy ironically-Risata il Rosso-you should try it!), my final thoughts to you are this: if you ever want to learn about a country or a culture, the best way to go about it is to go there. Cultural immersion, as they call it, is essential to learning and life experience. While you might be held back by lack of funds or a chaotic schedule, I strongly suggest making a solid effort to get outside of your box. Force yourself to be uncomfortable but most importantly, go into any experience with an open mind. You won’t regret it.

Right at the beginning, I have to admit that I am part of the problem I am complaining about. We have visited Rome on a cruise, and I suspect that the explosion of cruise tourism has a significant role to play in the flood of tourists in Rome.
My wife and I booked the cruise almost eighteen months ago. At that time we were not yet aware of the problems caused by this form of tourism. Greta Thunberg was still an unknown student somewhere in Norway, and the cruise theme had not yet arrived in our consciousness.
Besides the vast CO2 emissions per passenger, the biggest problem of the cruise industry in Europe is the limited capacity of many ports of destination of the gigantic ships.
Places like Skala on Santorini, Venice, or Stavanger are regularly visited by large cruise ships with 2,000 to 4,000 passengers — sometimes several in one day.
Rome is not directly by the sea, but from the nearest port in Civitavecchia, large bus fleets with cruise ship passengers drive daily to the Italian capital.

I moved from one cultural landmark to another, trying not to get sunstroke. The morning started with a saving cup of coffee near Tivoli station. Then, a quick escape into the coolness of the cathedrals.
I was struck by the young men and women who sat alone in churches for long periods. Some knelt in prayer. Such beautiful, delicate bodies, already asking God for forgiveness for their indulgence in love.
Here, temptation came too easily.
Having feasted my eyes on the works of Raphael and Michelangelo, I looked around, searching for someone to channel this overwhelming creative energy into. Among the group of tourists stood a petite girl in a flowing white maxi skirt.
Her hair was darker than pitch, and her blue eyes closely followed the guide’s gestures. I noticed the delicate frame beneath her light white blouse.
She noticed me too. (Of course, I had been looking at her so intently!)
“It’s so wonderful to be here!” she said. “I’m an artist! I came to Rome for inspiration!”
She didn’t even need to say it. It was obvious.
She loved life the way the great painters of the Vatican did — Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Raphael Santi. Their works were a triumph of life itself. And standing before Peter Wenzel’s “Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden”, I realized — we were meant to meet here.
Feeling my desire to be closer, she quickly decided to make me her personal photographer to observe me better.
“Take a photo of me by that pinecone in the Cortile della Pigna!” she teased.
She posed and turned, again and again. It was obvious — I was already captivated.
Then she sighed:
“How will I go to the Villa Borghese alone now? Who will take my pictures?”
I was more than happy to go!
She sat in the metro as if in a sauna — flushed, damp, squeezed between two sturdy men pressing against her from either side. It was a new painting — her, in tight quarters, in the stifling heat.
But she looked only at me. Without blinking.
Melted by the art of the Borghese Gallery, she came alive. Several times, she leaned in, drowning me in the sweet scent of her perfume, explaining this or that masterpiece.
“Sacred and Profane Love” by Titian.
“Do you see how different they are, yet they share the same painting?” she asked.
I also found myself drawn to Correggio’s ‘Danaë’. Instinctively, I compared the beauty next to me to the legendary princess, draped in nothing but fate itself. From this perspective, Cranach the Elder’s ‘Venus and Cupid’ intrigued me as well.
Stepping outside, surrounded by the intoxicating scent of pine, she declared:
“Photograph me however you like!”
I wanted her to lie down on a stone bench, among the ancient Roman statues.
I hadn’t expected her to be so bold.
A true artistic soul. Intriguing was an understatement.
We dined at a café facing the Pantheon.
After the second glass of wine, she asked:
“Have you ever been in love?” (God, why do women always ask this question?)
I hesitated.
She downed her wine, clinked glasses with me in a brotherhood toast, and said:
“Let’s go for a walk!”
That night is impossible to forget.
By midnight, we realized that finding a taxi in Rome was nearly impossible. I felt like a gladiator, returning from a victorious battle, carrying her in my arms along the Roman Forum, nearly out of strength.
Her soft body could be traced through the gentle folds of fabric.
Strangely, she never let me kiss her that night.
Surviving, I left for Florence, but my mind stayed with her.
I visited its stunning cathedrals, the Uffizi Gallery, and Palazzo Pitti. My hotel room was small, but the bright moon watched over me, reminding me of her.
We often texted, and then, one day, she came — for half a day only.
This time, she looked different.
She realized that Florence and Rome were two entirely different worlds.
No longer dressed in white, but in deep blue.
Her hair, once tied in a tight bun, was now let loose, cascading like the curls of Botticelli’s Venus.
Every strand carried a message — an echo of past centuries, where every glance could become a masterpiece, every movement — art in itself.
Two days passed, but it felt like a lifetime. We walked a little.
“I think about you often,” I admitted.
“So do I,” she replied.
When I returned to Rome, I immediately arranged to meet her at the Spanish Steps.
She looked breathtaking in her evening dress and lace-up heels.
“By the way,” she said, “I was invited for a scooter ride across Rome tonight. But since you’re here, I want to spend the evening with you.”
Women love sitting in restaurants, don’t they? Have you ever noticed?
We ordered plenty of wine and braised pork in white wine.
At some point, her image started to blur in my mind, as if she had hypnotized me.
“God, I can’t keep up with you!” I admitted.
“Walk me to my hotel,” she said.
Her legs rested on the red leather couch.
Looking at me intently, she spoke about random things, but in reality, she was deciding the fate of the night.
How she decided — let that remain our little Italian secret.
What I can say is that Italy will always stay with me — vivid, alluring, unashamedly in love with life, gifting the world its greatest art: the art of love.
Every moment spent with Ni unveils new dimensions of grace and mystery. Dive deeper into her world in:
Silent Observer

To meet WHO…? That was the question posed to me by my mother not but a day or two ago. I’d just explained my intention to treat this trip to Italy differently and make a few unfamiliar stops in a slow arc toward the Adriatic coast from Rome as opposed to the beeline I’ve been mapping religiously each visit this year. It must have seemed odd to have encouraged such wide-eyed curiosity from her.
Although I know I shouldn’t, I still find myself confused that others don’t share the love of solo travel (and especially withOUT plans) like I do.
So here I am now, at the initiation of day two in Italy, driving the hour from Poli, a small countryside village an hour outside of Roma to L’Aquila, a town in the smack center of the country, easily found by someone blindfolded and effectively the midpoint traversing from one coast to the other.
This morning as the sound of donkeys honking just outside my window nearly wake me, I choose to lay comfortably in bed a bit longer. After finally deciding to start my day remembering I’m alone in Italy — my “happy place” — I check my phone to learn I had managed to sleep in until 11:30 in the morning. Like a madman, I think for a moment the clock is wrong. I jump to freshen up and begin my saunter to the kitchen to find coffee before beginning the journey to my next adventure.
Day one was truly a reminder that going into travel with no expectations may be the best life hack ever invented. I selected my first night in Poli purely based on the fact that it was only an hour drive outside of where I would land in Roma Fiumicino. And I know from experience that the 3-hour drive to the coast is not exactly what I enjoy doing after an 8-hour redeye over the Atlantic. So I chose the house on the hill described as the “studio among the olive trees” from my AirBnB options. I had no idea what I was signing up for was joining a pseudo family for the night. I was greeted with offers to walk the donkeys, meet the dogs, the cat, and try foods I’d never seen in real life. I was given a private tour of a heart-stoppingly stunning municipal building covered in wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling watercolor-like frescoes by someone who clearly saw the interior only as an excuse for art.
Fully prepared to go out to dinner and eat alone that night, as I do quite frequently traveling through Italy by myself, I am delighted to receive an offer instead to join the family for dinner including a German friend stereotypically named Klaus. Recently in pensione, he had purchased and remodeled a villa/castle just up the road from where the couple lived. He is thrilled to have the opportunity to get back to English, a language that comes with fewer tongue ties than his intro-level Italian. We spend the evening eating chicory greens, oven-baked potatoes perfectly crisp, and some kind of delectable deconstructed meatballs so light they seem to melt in my mouth rendering chewing an obsolete ritual. We wash it down with a deliciously dry white wine from the Lazio region then a perfectly strong Grappa also from Lazio then, of course, no meal is complete without a shot of espresso. And just as I wonder whether this last sip could keep me up all night, I recall I had been traveling for over 24 hours, and everything would work out just fine.
This morning, as I wake nearly to the lunch hour, this time it is no surprise that I am invited to the adjacent kitchen to enjoy a breakfast cookie and coffee with my new family before hitting the road. I nibble on my flower-shaped homemade biscotti thinking how impossible it seems that they so easily disintegrate as they touch my tongue, overhearing conversations by the old gentleman on his phone discussing his methodology for recognizing whether or not mushrooms found in the local forests are safe and spicy or not. As he hangs up he gesture-explains the practice of taking a small nibble of mushrooms then rubbing them against his wrist as a test and how funny it is to watch people walking around biting and spitting down the line while hunting funghi through the woods.
I take my last mouthful of caffè and wish I could steal every recipe I can get my hands on. I’m told a quick story of a local cookie made only of flour, sugar, and wine and imagine war-time Italy as a nonstop show of Chopped, only better.
Reluctantly, I say my farewells, including at least 15 to 20 thank you’s and goodbyes. I promise a future stop that might involve my real family someday for the opportunity to sit down for a grand meal again. I step into my rental car and begin my exit as the automatic gate opens slowly in front of me. My phone connects to the Bluetooth and a song sets the tone for my travels. Sia sings to me that she has no dollar bills and loves cheap thrills. I giggle realizing I hadn’t spent a penny since arrival given the way my Italian hosts had taken me in and refused me to cover so much as the one euro glass of Prosecco we’d enjoyed as an aperitivo the night before. I smirk reflecting on the fact that having a lifestyle involving a solo trip to Italy more than four times a year is nothing short of luxury.
It’s a cloudy day and I begin my drive through the seemingly hand-chiseled road from Poli to the autostrada. My soundtrack turns to classical music as my phone shuffles to the next track. I imagine being in some sort of cheeky Italian car commercial… Pretty girl drives away speedily, stick-shifting through the Italian hillside as high energy strings harmonize in the background. A Lancia logo covers the scene and the tagline reads — You too can be an escape artist.
It’s nearly lunch now, even though I can still taste the coffee from moments ago. I am more than ready to clean a plate or two of whatever the next trattoria I find may be able to offer. I’ll stick to no expectations. All I know is that where I’m headed I’ve never been. And with no one I’ve ever met. Surrounded by things I’ve never seen. Stepping away someone I am not now.
Andiamo.

“From tourist to pilgrim”. This is an excellent name for a project organised by the Pantheon as a welcome service. I first visited Rome ten years ago as a reluctant tourist, fully aware that I was not ready explore its riches, and that the two days I had to spend there could not do it justice.
I return as a true pilgrim of Western Civilisation, its art and its history. Just like a pilgrim of days past, I must suffer long distances, pilfering conmen both small-scale and large, in a faraway, unfamiliar land, and deal with the vagaries of local cuisines like sugary croissants and exotic, unfamiliar pastas. Indeed it was only after travelling in Italy that I even realised what I had known as “Italian cuisine” hardly exists in Italy, with regional cuisines changing dramatically over just a few hours’ train journey.
I had spent so much time in the last decade reading about and watching documentaries and videos on Rome and its art, it was a strange feeling to physically walk across the Tiber on the Ponte Sant’Angelo surrounded by Bernini’s angels, gazing at della Porta’s dome of St Peter’s Basilica looming over the horizon.
The long straight sweeping boulevard makes for an imposing entry, with the view of the basilica and its dome bordered by the buildings on the side of that grand avenue. Surprisingly though, I thought it looked much smaller than expected upon reaching the Piazza designed by Bernini. As the Roman buildings fall behind and the symmetrical colonnades bracketing the vast piazza emerge, it is almost surprising to see the basilica does not extend further.
Perhaps this is an example of the mind’s tendency to exaggerate expectations of the dimensions of things it has held in high esteem, but the basilica feels dwarfed by the expansiveness of the piazza. Bernini’s use of space overshadows Michelangelo’s magnificent jewel box. Or perhaps this impact is due to the sweeping boulevard leading up to it, built by Mussolini in the age of the automobile. As one moves closer to the basilica and it looms larger, expectations crescendo, and it feels as though one is only looking at a part of it, and that the building must extend to the sides.
Once inside however, the dimensions reset, and the pilgrim is hit by the full force of the splendour of counterreformation Baroque in all its glory. It is a convincing utilisation of the power of art to dazzle 16th century Europe into accepting the Roman Church’s claims to divine authority.
St Peter’s basilica is ostensibly a shrine to the apostle Peter, or to God, or whatever the assertions of Catholic theology claim. To me, and I suspect to many modern visitors, this is a shrine to Bernini and Michelangelo, as well as the other saints of Baroque art whose genius adorns the basilica.
Is this the broader fate of churches in Europe? As the number of sincere worshippers in the pews dwindle and are replaced by tourists and pilgrims of art and history, churches are turning into living museums and art galleries. Many churches seem to be accepting of this trend, trying to indirectly monetise their art collections.
For example, the Church of St Ignatius Loyola has a mirror and coin-operated lights for visitors wanting to admire its dramatic, jaw-droppingly beautiful fresco. One would imagine the price of €1 for around 60 seconds of light, must be sufficient to pay for the maintenance of the fresco and perhaps other parts of the church. When I was there, there was even soft, calming spa music playing in the background. Bernini’s magnificent Ecstacy of St. Theresa also has a similar coin-operated lighting system though it is not absolutely necessary to admire the work.
At St Peter’s and other sites in Rome, I often thought of Sir Kenneth Clark’s quips and insights in his Civilisation documentary. I tried to follow the contours of Michelangelo’s basilica that “carries the eye round as if it were the carving of a torso”, though I could not get very far before being herded back to the constricted tourist path by an attendant.
The Sistine Chapel is still the holiest site of Western art, and therefore perhaps of Western Civilisation itself. The thrill of seeing in real life some of the most iconic images of the world continues beyond Michelangelo’s Creation of Man as one progresses on life’s journey through the world of art and literature.
Even if you know certain works of art live in certain museums or churches, there is still a thrill when you actually encounter them, since you never know precisely where in the museum or church they are, and their first sight is always a surprise. My highlight was stumbling upon Proust’s Odette de Crécy in Botticelli’s Life of Moses on the southern wall — the melancholy face of Zipporah that makes a suave, intelligent, highly eligible Parisian dandy fall in love with a courtesan because of her resemblance to the daughter of Jethro.
I fell in love with the Baroque in the Germanic lands and made the pilgrimage to Rome in large part to visit the birthplace of the Baroque, which was born out of the Catholic Church’s resolution to use the power of art to woo back worshippers to fight back against the Protestant reformation. I was amply rewarded with its many Baroque treasures, some more famous than others.
However, I was also surprised to discover I sometimes found it more difficult to enjoy the beauty of churches in Rome, for several reasons.
Firstly, it is more difficult to overlook the destructive role of early Christianity in classical Rome and its conflicts with paganism. The majestic ruins of the Roman fora are too close to not feel them stoically bearing witness to the desecration of their holy Pantheon, where even after 1,500 years the church feels like an invasive occupier, out of place in the naturalistic, circular architecture where the oculus offers nature-worshippers a direct communion with the sky. The niches of the dome once adorned with sculptures of pagan Roman deities look achingly empty.
This sense of loss is not felt in the Germanic baroque, perhaps because either there was nothing comparable before, or if there was, it has been lost to history. There are no churches built over destroyed temples to Thor that we know of, even if there were probably Roman temples in Vindobona, the Roman military camp that became Vienna.
After all, it was at the medieval church on Capitoline Hill nearby, where barefoot friars walked in the former temple of Juno, that Edward Gibbon was inspired to write The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.
My art pilgrimage trail took me from the Pantheon to Bernini’s fountain of the four rivers at the Piazza Navona, where I stumbled upon the basilica of St Agnes in Agone, another site whose history forces the visitor to remember the clash of early Christianity with European paganism. The baroque church is said to be built on the site of the tomb of the martyred saint, believed to have been tortured and killed by pagan Roman authorities.
Here I discovered the second reason why it can sometimes be more difficult to enjoy Roman baroque. At least in this instance, it is too transparent in its attempt to use the power of visual art to dazzle people into faith, and into submission to the authority of the Roman Church. The origin of baroque art was utilitarian, to be a tool of the counterreformation, but this seems to be one of its more crude and least convincing applications. Perhaps the Baroque had to go through these phases in its Roman birthplace before maturing into its more impressive stages. At St Agnes of Agone, a certain lack of sincerity, feeling, and faith seeps through the frescos of overly dramatic animated figures looking down at you with theatrically exaggerated emotions, matched by equally exaggerated expressions carved in marble in a grand and opulently designed space that exhibits the unmasked power and wealth of the so-called Catholic Church.
This is the third impediment to enjoying the Roman baroque: the flagrant corruption of the Roman church is so ubiquitous, it is impossible to avert one’s eyes from it in Rome. The Latin name of the Borgia family, which has become a byword for licentiousness and rapaciousness, “Borghesis”, is still vainly stamped across St Peter’s entablature (the technical term for the part below the pediment, the triangular gable). It makes it very difficult for any reasonable outsider to take its spiritual claims seriously, creating a dissonance with its aesthetic richness.
Palaces stamped with the names of royal families are de rigour and to be expected, but churches defaced with the names of aristocratic families?
Beauty, utility and politics
It must be one of the biggest hoaxes ever perpetrated in history. With a few exceptions, the papacy was held by the eminent Italian aristocratic families of the day, who successfully fooled all of western Europe for 300 or years, and southern Europe for another 300 odd years, into believing their claims to divine authority, in addition to the temporal authority they held as wealthy noblemen and princes, wearing not merely a crown and commanding armies, but also claiming to be the divinely-ordained representative of Christ on earth.
It is a hoax that is humoured even today by the legal and diplomatic recognition of 44ha of the Roman neighbourhood surrounding St Peter’s, as a sovereign nation state, simply because the Roman church still refuses to accept the authority of any government, and has too many devoted followers all around the world that governments need to appease.
Render unto Caesar what belongs to Caesar? Not the pope, who is still Caesar in his own microstate, which has its own train station and postal service, and where visitors without a ticket or special dispensation are only allowed as far as Bernini’s piazza and, if you ask the border guard nicely, one small street to visit a church. Countries still spend taxpayer funds maintaining embassies specifically to the Vatican, which visitors pass by on their way. Admittedly, it would be a rounding error for countries like Canada or the United Kingdom, but surely, Nigerian taxpayer funds can be better spent than on renting an office and employing staff to maintain a separate mission to the Holy See, in addition to the embassy to Italy. The Roman Catholic Church remains the only religious denomination in the world to control its own territory legally beyond the reach of any nation state.
This confrontation with the historical context of the Baroque forces me to examine my own attraction to it.
Although many centuries and a culture removed from the target audience of illiterate European peasants the art was targeted at to win over their hearts and minds , I must confess, I have always wanted to be dazzled by the power of art unleashed by the Catholic Church.
Admiring the awe-inspiring fresco of St Ignatius Loyola, I consider, why not? What’s wrong with wanting to have one’s eyes caressed by such extravagant beauty?
The mind protests nonetheless: did the Roman Church not effectively abuse art and its power to pursue its own political power? Was it that different to the propaganda of unsavoury regimes in world history? Or perhaps the use of convincing, alluring imagery used by cigarette companies in their advertising, like Marlboro Man?
Perhaps.
However, I would argue that the effect of good Baroque art, and its ability to stir awe and something deeper in us even today, shows that at a certain level, the power of art is one that cannot be controlled for human ends — it stays with the art as an independent force, regardless of who unleashed it, or their motives.
Perhaps the artist, the creator, is more like a shaman able to invoke the spirit, the life force that true art is. Once unleashed, it retains its own power regardless of the shape it has been given, the identity of the shaman-artists or their intentions. True beauty, and the art that bears it, transcends such worldly matters.
Beauty cannot be intellectualised, rationalised or indeed even moralised, and neither can the best exemplars of art, which can sometimes almost become synonymous with beauty. It was an inspired decision for a religious authority like the Catholic Church to use this transcendental power of art to give their believers a glimpse into the afterlife.
In truth, the theology behind the art does not really matter, nor do the stories being told by the art. Rather, it is in the emotional effect these works of art have on the viewer, that the power of art lies, and which transcends the artist, patron and their motives and beliefs.
It is true that experiencing this power may have convinced many a German or Italian peasant of the very legitimacy of the political power of the Catholic Church, and helped to gloss over its corruption.
Nonetheless, I can experience the same power centuries later as a pilgrim of art, and get a glimpse into the Transcendent, or in the words of Baudelaire, get an “inkling of the glories that lie beyond the grave.”
Western Civilisation as the Rises and Falls of Romes
Climbing Michelangelo’s staircase to the top of Capitoline Hill, one takes in a landscape drenched in history. Elegant domes of Baroque churches seem to rise phoenix-like from the vast Roman ruins, which “even after three centuries in which they were used as quarries, and in which our sense of scale has expanded, they still are surprisingly big.”
As the heart of the ancient Roman Empire, Capitoline Hill has retained its mystique through the centuries as a symbolic focal point of Western Civilisation, especially in its political manifestations. Even today, its memories linger on symbolically in almost every modern Western nation.
Monarchs through the last two millennia have styled themselves after the Roman Emperors, depicted with laurel wreaths in portraits, including on modern coins struck in the name of Queen Elizabeth II. German and Russian emperors literally called themselves Caesar (i.e. Kaiser and Tsar in their languages) until 1918, and Germany even called itself the Holy Roman Empire until 1806, despite never actually ruling Rome. Roman eagles are still the symbols of governments from Russia to Poland, Germany, France, and the United States of America, the republic which openly modelled itself on Rome, even building its own Capitol Hill.
Trajan’s Column stands nearby, and I notice its similarity to the column in what I think is Paris’s most beautiful and certainly most storied town “square”, Place Vendome. To digress, it is technically an octagon, and Chanel’s watches pay homage to its shape. The original Trajan column in ancient Rome had a statue of Emperor Trajan, which at some point went missing and was replaced by a statue of St. Peter. Meanwhile Napoleon’s likeness still stands atop the Vendome column, dressed as an ancient Roman emperor, crowned with laurels.
Outside the world of power and politics, even Lufthansa calls one of the premium tiers of its loyalty program “Senator”. The list of Rome’s influence on the modern world goes on.
Rome is truly the eternal city. Arguably the ruins and the inspiration of their legacy are as historically significant as the empire itself. Ever since Rome, every time a Western polity rose to greatness or sought to project greatness in the eyes of the world, it did so in the garb of Rome. In some ways then, the story of Western Civilisation is the story of successive rises and falls of Romes in different parts of Europe and North America.
Today, it is possible to survey the sweep of history at the Capitoline hill in Rome and behold the eras that have left their signatures in the language of architecture, in this vast open-air guestbook of Time.
The sheer scale of ruins from antiquity are indeed awe-inspiring, and it is perhaps not difficult to empathise with the many generations who have felt dwarfed by its achievements. According to Christopher Clark, the people of the dark ages were crushed by the scale of the ruins left behind by the Roman Empire and could not believe they were the work of men, treating them as natural phenomena “like mountains, and built their huts in them, as who should take advantage of a ravine or sheltering escarpment”.
The achievements of antiquity continued to weigh on artists like Henry Fuseli into the late 18th century, as expressed in his drawing The Artist’s Despair Before the Grandeur of Ancient Ruins, depicting the colossal hand of Constantine found in the Capitoline museum.
The early Christian era is represented on Capitoline Hill by the cavernous but in the grand scheme of churches not especially impressive, Romanesque Basilica of Santa Maria in Ara Coeli, where inspiration struck Gibbon to write his Decline and Fall.
The most beautiful part of the Capitoline Hill is still Michelangelo’s circular piazza with its hypnotising, almost tantric pattern around it, and the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius standing in the middle, the “only one ancient Emperor to remain above ground in the sunshine through the centuries”.
Michelangelo’s piazza and its humanist dimensions shows the confidence of the giants of the Renaissance, who “bursting with vitality and confidence, were not in a mood to be crushed by antiquity. They meant to absorb it, to equal it, to master it.”
Its timeless elegance, and the simplicity of its humanist splendour maintain a quiet dignity despite being overshadowed by the most recent attempt of an era to leave its mark on the Capitoline Hill, the enormous Vittoriano monument from the late 19th and early 20th century.
It still physically dominates the landscape today, newer, bigger and shinier than Michelangelo’s piazza. But in the topographical history book that is Rome, it can also look like a signpost of the wrong turn that Western Civilisation took in the late 19th century, which paved the way to the catastrophes of the 20th.
The historicist Vittoriano certainly houses many works of beauty and is like a modern rendition of an enormous marble Roman temple, dedicated to the Italian fatherland. However, it relies a bit too heavily on size to assert dominance and demand visual attention, perhaps revealing the insecurity and brashness of the late 19th century and its newly unified Italian state that first commissioned it. A cynic may even argue it was an attempt to make up in sculpture for Italy’s failures in the battlefield.
Perhaps I am too much in thrall to 19th century Italy’s arch rival, the Habsburg Empire (see my love letter to Vienna). Despite my deep love of Italy’s culture, history, language, cuisine and its people, I have always struggled to extend that awe to its history as a modern nation state.
“Great nations write their autobiographies in three manuscripts: the book of their deeds, the book of their words and the book of their art. Not one of these books can be understood unless we read the two others, but of the three the only trustworthy one is the last”, wrote John Ruskin.
Italy’s book of its art is the finest in Europe and perhaps the world, but if my Italian friends can forgive me for saying so, the book of its deeds is a bit less impressive
For much of its modern history, Italy lay at the crossroads of rival European powers and was always governed by a multitude of political entities, with the North often a political chessboard where the great French-Austrian rivalry played out. Metternich famously described Italy as merely a geographical expression.
Ultimately, Italy could achieve unification only as a fortuitous by-product of French and especially Prussian campaigns to weaken the Austrian Empire, with most of their own military attempts ending in failure.
What should a visitor make of the Vittoriano? It is an altar to the fatherland in the form of a memorial to Vittorio Emanuele II, whose enormous equestrian statue takes centre stage, echoing that of Marcus Aurelius in the neighbouring piazza. The Savoyard monarch became the first king of a unified Italy in 1867, but this required assistance from both France, as well as Prussia, who defeated the Austrians in the faraway Silesian plains of Königgratz. As a result, they had to cede the parts of the Veneto region they had successfully defended against the Italians until then.
Ignoring the technicality that Italy has never truly unified because of the hole in its capital city from the Vatican insisting on its temporal sovereignty, the unified Kingdom of Italy only lasted 79 years, a split second in Roman historical terms, before the monarchy was abolished in a relatively close referendum in 1946, with the republicans winning 54% of the vote, mostly in the wealthy north of the country. The king was exiled, and his male descendants were forbidden from entering the country until 2002. Within another half century or so since the referendum, Italy was subsumed into the European Union, where nationalism has become a bit of a dirty word in polite society.
The prominence of the nationalistic Vittoriano on the Capitoline thus seems somewhat out of proportion with its historical relevance in the grand scheme of Roman history. A modern glass lift takes you to a terrace with magnificent views of the Coliseum, and from its top, the visitor can also admire the many domes of Papal Rome including St Peter’s across the Tiber.
With the full sweep of Western political history presented topographically in the mind of the visitor, the Vittoriano comes across as a colossal altar to a temporary burst of a very confused Italian nationalism that lurched somewhat schizophrenically between clericalism, monarchism, republicanism and with the EU, supranationalism.
The contrast is even stronger next to the lucid, harmonious expression of the timeless humanism of the Renaissance. It is worth remembering humanism is centred on the human being, and its architecture is dimensioned accordingly to accomodate humans, not to overwhelm them.
The mortal remains of Vittorio Emanuele II are buried in the ancient Pantheon, in royal tombs which are still guarded by an honour guard wearing cloaks bearing the royal coat of arms of pre-1946 Italy. By good fortune I found myself at the Pantheon on a day the guards of the royal tombs were celebrating an event, and caught a glimpse of the man who would be crown prince. He approached the Pantheon to the jubilant strains of the Royal March trumpeted by uniformed bands playing the erstwhile national anthem of Italy.
The prominence and scale of the Vittoriano would be much more coherent if the Italians had kept their monarchy in some form.
The Compost Heap of History
After some time in Rome, as you explore the ruins and discover and understand more and more layers of its history, it begins to weigh on you. You feel the weight of Rome as “the compost heap of history”, as described by Sir Clark.
You know you are just another one of the countless humans to have trod down these same roads and piazzas that have been around for longer than mankind can remember. You are merely the topsoil of the compost heap, that too for a blink of an eye before being buried by the future. The weight of countless centuries and their achievements impose upon the individual not only his own inconsequentiality, but even that of his entire era.
The era your lifetime affords you a glimpse of is but a tiny fraction of time in this city’s history. That too shall pass, and it will not be remembered as the era that saw the rise of Rome, the pinnacle of its civilisation, its fall, its trough, or its rebirth in the Renaissance. It is not even the era of the rediscovery of the rebirth, which inspired fresh waves of art and creativity.
You know you are walking in the shadows of Goethe on his Roman trip, who walked in the shadows of Winckelmann, the father of art history who poetically described his rapture at ancient Greek sculptures in the 18th century and held them to be the highest ideal of art.
You are dwarfed even by Rilke dismissing the reverence of Roman antiquity and its hold on the imagination, complaining more than a hundred years ago, of Rome and:
“the lifeless and drear museum-like atmosphere it breathes, the abundance of fragments of the past (on which a tiny present nourishes itself), that have been fetched out of the ground and laboriously maintained, the unspeakable excess of esteem, nourished by academics and philologists with the help of run-of-the-mill tourists, given to all these disfigured and spoilt objects which after all are the vestiges of another age and of a life that is not our own and can never be.”
Knowing all this, is originality even possible? Or is human history just endless cycles of repetitions of the same impulses, emotions and ambitions, with only the dates and costumes changing?
Wondering how many of the masses understand the significance of what they are clicking away at with their phones, and confronting the shallowness of your knowledge even after this pilgrimage, it can be easier to sympathise with the eras that felt crushed by antiquity, than to be inspired by the Renaissance.
But then again, “the story of Western Civilisation is one of rebirths, so we should be encouraged.” And so we await the next rebirth, hunched over our phones.
After the cataclysms of the 20th century, which the Vittoriano reminds us of, it will likely be many more years before modern Europeans can rediscover the confidence let alone the creativity, and dare I say, spirituality, to launch the next Renaissance.
My pilgrimage remains incomplete. I know there is still much I don’t know about Rome, its history, and its art treasures, many of which I was unable to see this time, and many more whose existence I don’t yet know of, waiting to be discovered, and perhaps even more whose existence I will never know in this lifetime…
“The physical pain and the nobility of soul are distributed with equal strength over the entire body and are, as it were, held in balance with one another. Laocoon suffers, but he suffers like Sophocles’ Philoctetes; his pain touches our very souls, but we wish that we could bear misery like this great man.”
— Johann Joachim Winckelmann, Reflections on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture, 1755

In 2015, I celebrated my 60th birthday. I’m a sucker for celebrating milestone birthdays, so I decided it was time to take a Mediterranean cruise. I love cruising; I had already experienced cruises to Alaska and New England. And I knew from my previous trips to Italy, Germany, and Prague that I also loved Europe. So, I thought, why not meld the two with a European cruise.
I convinced my husband that I deserved to go on this cruise (which I did) and that we would start in Rome, and we’d also visit Athens and Istanbul, among other port towns and cities. I had previously visited Rome for about a week, but my husband had never been there, so we decided to spend a day in Rome before the cruise ship disembarked.
Well, the cruise ship doesn’t take off from Rome but from the port town of Civitavecchia, about an hour away from Rome. This trip represented a splurge, to say the least, so my husband decided we would take the train from Rome to Civitavecchia to save $100. When I told one of my well-traveled co-workers that we would take the train from Rome to Civitavecchia, he told me to make sure and watch out for gypsies.
I could tell he was somewhat serious, but at the mention of gypsies, my thoughts immediately turned to a Carmen-type character with hoop earrings, jet black hair, and flowing scarves and skirts…

Rome. The Eternal City. Roma Urbs Aeterna in Latin. Where do I start this article? I have been to Rome 3 and a bit times now, the bit being a day trip from Sorrento in 1997, the longer visits in 1974, 2017, and 2023. In total about 26 days. That is nowhere near enough to see everything. But I won’t start with Rome itself. I will start with Alan Sugar, Lord Sugar, the billionaire director/owner of over 20 companies, and the host of the BBC programme The Apprentice.
Why Lord Sugar in a talk on Rome? Well in July 2023 Lord Sugar went to Pompeii. On July 9th 2023 on Twitter, or X to give it its new moniker, he told his followers ‘Visit to Pompei. Glad I went there but once you have seen one old wall you seen them all’. Now if you have ever read Lord Sugar’s posts on Twitter/X, you soon realise that he does not always take kindly to disagreement or criticism. He can be a little abusive sometimes. I felt I had to say something, but not welcoming an insulting reply, I cautiously replied ‘Really?’. I’m glad to say that was that.
My brief careful reply indicates I do not agree with his sentiment. Why? Because I openly admit that when it comes to Roman walls and other remains from Greek and Roman times, I am a total nerd. An enthusiast my kinder friends would say, but, yes, a nerd.
By way of example, in July 2023 I finally made it to a couple of places in England I have wanted to visit for some time, Maryport and Bowness on Solway in Cumbia. At Maryport the remains of the fort and vicus are lumps and bumps in a field of sheep. There is an excellent museum, the best collection of altars in Britain apparently, and a replica signal tower. Oh, and a signpost telling us we were only 1147 miles from Rome as the crow flies. A short morning stroll maybe?
There is even less to see at Bowness On Solway, everything has gone. The village church is partly built from Roman masonry. But it is the west end of Hadrian’s Wall and I had never been west of Carlisle before. I will say the views over the Solway Firth are magnificent, and driving along the old road towards Carlisle, now known as Cycle Route 72, you are following the line of the wall as well as noting bits of ditch and vallum here and there. Also the occasional building with a chunk of Roman stone in the wall. It is a lovely drive, and the views are wonderful. But definitely a journey for a nerd. It is a fair way from my home in Warrington, and not the best of roads once you leave the M6, which is often not much good either.
So this is the first of a number of articles/chapters on some of the sites in and around Rome itself, which do not always feature in the average guide book. But I hope they will be of interest to more than Classical History nerds like me.
I have a document on my computer. It is known to a very small number of friends with a similar interest as ‘The List’. Nothing sinister, a list of ‘things’ in Rome and the surrounding areas we haven’t seen yet or haven’t seen everything there. ‘Things’ get added to ‘The List’ if I read about them or see a mention of them on the internet. So when we went in May 2023 ‘The List’ helped us plan what to do each day.
I suspect I would need to spend about 6 months in Rome to exhaust ‘The List’ and I know I never will. It is far from comprehensive and contains huge structures and single columns or fragments. There are bits of ancient Rome all over the city and new things come to light all the time. Is there an exhaustive list somewhere? I guess the Italian archaeology authorities have one. Some English books have a good go, but they don’t contain everything. In any case, the majority of visitors only have time for the well-known sites, not the more obscure stuff that interests me as much as the big sites. Being realistic you are looking at a year or two to see everything.
Having acknowledged that, you sometimes find that these sites not on the standard ‘must see’ list have an interesting story attached to them. Seeing and investigating something that many people have never heard of, or have seen mentioned on a documentary can tell you something new about the history of Rome, or the lives of the people who lived there from the city’s founding in the Iron Age to its fall around 1200 years later.
So, if you are exploring Rome and its neighbourhood in the 21stC AD, what do you need? Decent footwear and a hat for starters. A smart phone with Google Maps (or similar) is very handy too. For a guidebook with a difference, look for books by Louis F Aulbach and Linda C Gorski in the series Rome In Ruins — Self Guided Walks. Another book to use, but rather too bulky to carry round is Rome, An Oxford Archaeological Guide by Amanda Claridge. Finally once there, go to a tobacconist or the Termini Railway station, and get a runaround Atac transport ticket for bus, tram, metro, and local trains. At 24 euros for 7 days (2023 price), a bargain.
You may have already been to Rome and seen the major sites, possibly a lot of the minor ones too. Who has visited the Imperial Forums? The Colosseum? The Circus Maximus? The Palatine Hill? The Baths Of Caracalla? The Pantheon? Trajan’s Column? Not to mention less ancient sites like The Vatican? The Spanish Steps? The Trevi Fountain?
Maybe the Saepta Julia? The Basilica Of Neptune? Yes? No? Ok, well this is where the less well-known sites come into their own. But, if you visited the Pantheon, well, maybe you just passed by the Saepta Julia, and the Basilica Of Neptune without realizing. Most people do. I did on previous visits up till May 2023.
So where is the Saepta Julia? What is it? Well, it is on the left hand side of the Pantheon (from the front), on Via della Minerva. The remains are lower than the street level. Watch out for the traffic and look over the wall. The Saepta was planned by Julius Caesar around 54 BC, and finished by Agrippa in 26 BC. The building was initially intended to be used as a voting place for both the Comitia Centuriata, and the Comitia Tributa. These are 2 assemblies established during the Roman Republic. However, in between the time of its planning and completion, the Roman Republic fell, Julius Caesar was assassinated.
After Caesar’s assassination, Lepidus, a member of the ‘Second Triumvirate’ with Octavian (Augustus) and Antony, continued managing the project, and it was completed by Augustus’s right hand man, Agrippa in 26BC. The design was a quadriporticus, an open square with a colonnade on all 4 sides. It was 310 m long, and 120m wide. It was embellished with Travertine marble.
Under Augustus a voting hall was less of a priority, and the Saepta was repurposed for gladiatorial combat (no Colosseum or large arena at this point), and also a meeting point for the senate, as the new Senate House had only just been completed. It was also used for naumachia, arena based mock ship battles, in the reigns of Augustus and Caligula. After his military successes in Germany, Tiberius was ‘presented’ to the people in the Saepta at the end of his triumphal parade. Later the building was used as a market for luxury goods, depicted as such in the Lindsey Davis Falco and Albia novels. In the Great Fire of Rome in 80AD the building was destroyed. Reconstruction commenced soon afterwards, possibly just before Domitian’s reign, and further restoration took place under Hadrian. The Pantheon next door was also badly damaged in the fire, and rebuilt in Trajan or Hadrian’s reign, including the amazing dome. That is why on the front of the Pantheon, the inscription refers to it being built by Agrippa, even though most of the building is from a later time. No-one is sure why. Was Hadrian paying a compliment to Agrippa? If you have Discovery Channel check an episode of Blowing Up History, strangely entitled ‘Mystery Of The Volcano Temple’ about that. We know from a slave collar that the Saepta was still in use in the 4th C AD but after that there is no further mention in recorded history.
The visible remains of the Saepta are of the Porticus Argonautarum. It is named after the artwork it depicted, which showed Jason and the Argonauts. Little remains of the rest, and it is all under later buildings and the street. The layout is known from the ancient map of Rome, the Forma Urbis Romae, which went back on public display on the Caelian hill this January. Incidentally, that will have to be added to ‘The List’. Also note how ground level has changed. The Saepta seems on level ground, and yet the Via della Minerva runs uphill.
So to demonstrate what can be learned from small sites like this site that most people walk by — some very famous Romans involved in it — Julius Casear, Lepidus, Augustus, Agrippa, Tiberius, Caligula, Hadrian; the Great Fire of Rome; gladiatorial shows and naumachia, and commerce. You can learn a great deal from small ruins.
Round the back of the Pantheon on the quiet Via della Palombella are the remains of what is thought to be the Basilica of Neptune. The Basilica was built around 25BC to celebrate the Battle of Actium. The building was destroyed in the same 80AD fire that hit the Pantheon and the Saepta Julia. As per those buildings, final restoration took place in Hadrian’s reign. Most of the remains are under the building on the other side of Via della Palombella.
Again, the remains are at a lower level than the current street. The uncertainty about the identification of the building is that the Baths Of Agrippa and a few other nearby buildings were also destroyed in the fire, and the reconstruction may have combined the buildings. The visible remains are from Hadrian’s time and consist of a brick wall, 2 niches and an apse framed by two columns. It is also difficult to distinguish the wall from the back of the Pantheon. It is hard to say if they were literally adjoining or adjacent. But clearly in ancient Rome, some buildings were literally cheek by jowl. No wonder one fire spread rapidly and took out so many buildings.
Carrying on westwards along the Via della Palombella, you come to Via di San Eustachio. There are two large red granite columns and a fragment of architrave from the Baths Of Nero. The Baths were built around 62AD and were located west and north of the Pantheon. The columns, and a basin not far away off the Via della Dogana Vecchia, have been relocated. The baths were 190m by 120m in size, so quite a size, and were the first known imperial bath complexes in Rome. The baths underwent significant repairs and renovation around 227AD in the reign of Alexander Severus.
We know very little about the Temple of Isis, which was in this area. The location is not known either, but it is assumed to have been somewhere east and south of the Pantheon, A coin of Vespasian survives depicting it. We have also have a couple of obelisks which were brought from Egypt. The Macuteo Obelisk adorns the popular fountain in the Piazza della Rotunda. It was from the Temple of Ra erected by Ramses II in Heliopolis. It is thought it was brought to Rome in Domitian’s reign. It has been relocated twice, the current re-erection being in 1711 by Pope Clemente XI. Nearby in the Piazza della Minerva is the Minerveo obelisk, now sitting on top of an elephant sculpture carved by Gian Lorenso Bernini. It was placed there in 1667. The obelisk came to Rome in Diocletian’s reign. The obelisk was originally erected by Pharaoh Apries of the 26th Dynasty about 580 BC, in his capital Sais.
From the Forma Urbis Romae mentioned previously we know that the Serapeum was also east and south of the Pantheon. On a corner of a small side street on the Via di Pie di Marmo, or Marble Foot Street (yes, not a joke) is, as you may guess, a giant marble foot. Given the location where it was found, the foot is thought to be from a statue of Serapis, the partner of Isis. The cults of Isis and Serapis were brough to Rome at the start of the 1st C BC, having already been established at Greek and Italian tribal cities in southern Italy 200 years earlier. Temples to Isis and Serapis were first planned by the 2nd Triumvirate, but we know the Isis temple was destroyed by Tiberius during the reign of Augustus. Caligula of all people restored the Temple of Isis, and Vespasian later enhanced both temples. But the same fire of 80AD which destroyed so many buildings in the area also destroyed them both. In the reign of Domitian the Temples of Isis and Serapis were rebuilt. Domitian also commissioned a copy of an Egyptian obelisk which has an inscription proclaiming him ‘beloved of Isis’. That obelisk is now in the Piazza Navona, which I will come to shortly.
So within a short distance of the world famous Pantheon, which everyone flocks to, are much smaller remains which also tell the story of Rome, and are worth checking out. I haven’t covered them all either, there are more bits and pieces to check if I go again. That isn’t to diminish the Pantheon. It really is remarkable, and worth joining the queue to get inside. Just after we visited, admission charges were introduced, but if that helps with the upkeep, then no-one should complain.
The Piazza Navona is a famous open area in Rome. It is the shape of a stadium, because the buildings around it sit on the footprint of Domitian’s Stadium. We stayed near there in the Navona Palace Luxury Inn. Our taxi driver dropped us at the rather plush Palazzo Navona instead but that’s another story. When we got to the Navona Palace we wondered what on earth we had booked. It looks bleak. The reception area is tiny. But the rooms, wow, never had one so big before, large lounge, bedroom, bathroom, lots of storage, unlike the little wardrobes most hotels give you.
Anyway, it is a short walk back to the Piazza Navona. There are 3 fountains in the Piazza. The main one in the middle was built by Bernini and is called ‘La Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi’, the Fountain of the Four Rivers, the four statues representing the Danube (Europe), Ganges (Asia), Nile (Africa) and Rio de la Plata (Americas). Domitian’s obelisk adorns the overall statue. It was moved there from the Circus Of Maxentius on the Appian Way — the emperor Maxentius had moved it there. By the way, one of the restaurants in the Piazza is called 4 Fiumi after the statue, I can recommend it.
At ground level it is not that easy to see that the Piazza Navona is built on top of a Roman stadium. The overall shape is a clue, as would be the curvature of the buildings at the north end if the tarpaulins and the giant electric Samsung sign were not there. Domitian’s stadium was opened in 86AD, as part of an Imperial building programme in the area following the fire of 80AD which destroyed so many buildings. It held around 30,000 spectators. So rather less grand than the much better-known Circus Maximus, which can be seen today between the Palatine and Aventine hills. That held well over 100,000 spectators. Today of course, it is just an open park. Whatever masonry remains is waterlogged underground, and difficult to excavate. It didn’t help that the last structure there was Rome’s main gas works. But it does lend itself to big events, a Bruce Springsteen concert was due there the day after we left.
Domitian’s stadium’s substructures and support frames were made of brick and concrete, and clad in marble. The facades would have resembled the Colosseum; the floor plan was a scaled down version of the Circus Maximus, having a similarly semi-circular end. The total stadium length was around 275m, and the total width around 106m.
The Stadium was used almost entirely for athletic contests, apart from the early 3rd C AD, when it was used for gladiator shows while the Colosseum underwent fire damage repair. The stadium went of use in later Imperial times and probably became living quarters for poor people after the sack of Rome. Today you can visit a small part of the structure underground. The entrance is on the Via di Tor Sanguinga. You can see the stadium entry portico, stairs to the seating area, and arched arcades, as well as a collection of finds, and sculptures.
There is a single column in the Piazza dei Massimi just south of the Piazza Navona. It is the only visible remains of the Odeon of Domitian. Domitian’s was the first Odeon in Rome. An Odeon is a building of Greek origin and is a smaller building than a classical theatre, with a similar design. Hence the word was adopted by a well-known cinema chain in the 20thC. The column was discovered during excavations in 1936–37. The column is not in situ; it was re-assembled in 1950 and placed here as close as possible to where it is believed the Odeon’s location was. The column may have been from the scaena of the Odeon. A nearby Renaissance building, the Palazzo Massimo, has a curved shape, and it is thought it was built on the remains of the Odeon.
As an emperor Domitian gets very bad press. He was cruel and paranoic, always in fear of plots and assassination, and in the end that happened. Nevertheless, the scale of the rebuilding begun in his reign after the fire of 80AD does at least give him some credit. Many of the building remains that we can see in this area of the Campus Martius today are from structures started in his reign.
The area of the Campus Martius between and including the Piazza Navona and the Pantheon are an ideal place to start an exploration of Ancient Rome, both the well known structures and the small one. If you enjoyed this article, please look out for the rest. You can use the link below.

Just got back from Rome and wow — my design brain is buzzing. Living in London, I’m no stranger to great design and rich history, but Rome? Rome hits differently. I expected great pizza and pretty ruins — I didn’t expect to come home with a camera roll full of ancient typography, delicious textures, perfectly imperfect symmetry, and more colour palettes than a Figma project on deadline. Let’s be real — Rome is basically a giant open-air museum. But for designers? It’s like stepping into a full-on, living Pinterest board. Every alley, every crumbling wall, every café sign — pure inspiration.
From carved serifs on marble buildings to the delightfully OTT signage in Vatican gift shops, the city is basically a love letter to type. Roman capitals? Still iconic. No wonder they’re the foundation of so many modern fonts we use today. I found myself zooming in on inscriptions like they were rare design references — because honestly, they kind of are.
Terracotta walls, sage green shutters, creamy marble, soft pink sunsets — Rome lives in warm tones. Even the shadows feel romantic. I caught myself saying “this could be a brand identity” about actual buildings. The harmony of age, weathering, and sunlight creates a vibe you just can’t fake.
What really stood out? Rome isn’t pristine — it’s layered. It’s textured, chipped, mismatched. But that’s the magic. The clash of modern posters on centuries-old stone, graffiti tagging beside Renaissance fountains — it’s chaotic, it’s real, and it works. I’m taking that energy into my next project: less polish, more personality.
Rome’s layout is wild — a little chaotic, slightly confusing, but totally delightful. It’s like navigating a designer’s brain: nonlinear, surprising, but everything somehow fits. You wander and suddenly stumble on a tiny design gallery, a hidden vintage shop, or the most photogenic door you’ve ever seen. That randomness reminded me that not every journey (UX or otherwise) needs to be overly mapped out — sometimes, discovery is the design.
I went to Rome planning to eat my weight in pasta (and trust me, that’s saying something), but I ended up gaining so much more — a fresh appreciation for storytelling, bold contrasts, and embracing a little creative chaos. If you’re a London-based designer feeling stuck, I highly recommend hopping on a plane and getting lost in Rome’s visual magic. It’s a city that fills not just your sketchbook, but your soul too.
Oh, and don’t forget to pack an extra tote — those pasta dishes and vintage posters are absolutely irresistible.

Finally, after six years of not entering an airplane, my husband and I went for ten days to Italy. And as I write these words, English sounds like a bizarre language to me, so read this while picturing an Italian person speaking English with an Italian accent because that’s me right now.
We made a hell of a trip because we tried to see a lot of the country in ten days, which left us exhausted even if it was awesome.
We visited Lake Como, Milan, Le Cinque Terre, La Spezia, Pisa, Florence and Rome.
I will be writing a series of articles about each place in the following days. The dos and don’ts of this trip; how to plan your trip, where to eat and where not to eat, how to book trains and some extra information.
But this introductory article starts with one minor detail about Rome — and in short…

Exploring Ancient Rome to Design a Public Space
Ancient Rome is a topic on everyone’s minds at some stage of their lives… nearly at least haha. Well, today I will go into detail on how we can study it and look back at examples to create a lovely civic space that might not completely represent Rome but holds their principles.
Ancient Rome is said to have been around since before Jesus Christ and up until the medieval ages that then transitioned into Christianity. Today we shall focus on the building factor — architecture — and how it was.
Architecture in ancient Rome was very representative. It had very monumental buildings to present power. Think of verticality, the use of columns, design to showcase fame and history. The style of construction was mainly compression, arches, vaulted ceilings. Construction itself was spectacular, and the Romans turned it into great buildings.
Best and one of the most notable is the Pantheon. A building that has been standing for almost 2000 years and still maintains its form and function. It is truly one of the most amazing buildings that can be viewed in the world currently. The Pantheon, when looked at, portrays all of its values and functions. Any person that is not an architect can see that — proportions, power, embodiment, meaning, religion, temple. A holy place for the Romans.

I was so happy that we had a creative photoshoot in Rome!
What a big chaos when everyone is preparing! 😀
The stylists are putting makeup on my models, I am managing everyone to make sure we are in the best shape possible and are on time.
This photoshoot I arranged for my Rome models was in Vittoriano, which is a huge neoclassical, monument located right next to Piazza Venezia, in Rome’s city center.
Just to give you an idea of how centrally located Vittariano is:
The Roman Forum is just beside;
The Colosseum is only 5 minutes walk away;
Via del Corso, one of Rome’s main shopping streets is at the other end of Piazza Venezia;
Trajan’s Column is just in front;
Vittoriano is so big and attention-grabbing, it is difficult to miss it if you are walking in the center of the city and it is in stark contrast with anything else in the city. Italians call it ‘the typewriter’ (la macchina da scrivere) and tourists call it “the wedding cake” because of its shape.😊
The staircase is protected by a metal gate (which opens at 9:30 and closes at 19:30 with the last admission at 18.45) and has two fountains at its sides.The one East represents the Adriatic Sea, from where the sun rises, and the one West represents the Tyrrhenian Sea, where the sun sets, symbolizing the natural borders of the Italian peninsula.
At the center of the monument stands the equestrian statue of King Vittorio Emanuele II.During the reign of Victor Emmanuel II, twenty fragmented regions of Italy finally united into one country — the Kingdom of Italy.
The statue is 16 times bigger than a life-size horse and horseman and it hides a secret: the belly of the horse is empty and 24 people had dinner there in 1919! 😊
The monument to the unknown soldier is located in the center of the main staircase, dedicated to the Italians fallen during the I World War.
The changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier takes place every hour and we paused to see the ceremony.I really like men in a uniform and Italian guards in a military uniform in particular. Very yummy looking. 😋 😛
The next level up leads to the colonnade, made of 16 columns in Doric style.The 16 columns represent the 16 regions that formed Italy at the time.Each column is different from the other just to remind the differences and values each region contributed to the Italian identity.On the two sides of the main colonnade, there are the two propylaea.The writing at their top reads ‘Civium Libertati’ (‘Citizens’ Freedom) and ‘Unity of the homeland” (‘Patriae Unitati’).
Climbing farther up, we got to the first set of terraces.
From Terrazza Italia, we could see Trajan’s markets and the Roman Forum, with the Colosseum in the background.From there we took glass elevators and they brought us to the Terrazza delle Quadrighe (chariots pulled by horses, at the very top of the building). From there we saw the whole city!
Going back to my photoshoot, Il Vittoriano is the most distinctive and controversial monument in Rome.
Controversial is exactly how I felt that day for my photoshoot, by placing my provocative beautiful model Dasha right in the middle of it.My goal for the photoshoot was to synergize the female beauty with the beauty of the monument.
My model Dasha did a great job! Don’t you think?

Somebody called her a mother, the majestic one that traps you with her tenderness. Others a lover, the beautiful ones that will always betray and leave you empty.
Do you remember when you felt emptiness for the first time? For me, it was on a blue sky day warmed by a spring sun during a family trip to Rome. I grow up in a small town that looks nothing like an Italian postcard scenario. A place with no visible history that had turned into a breeding ground for an American-inspired landscape of big malls and fast food. Little by little, all the centers in my region started to look the same. Their identities were taken away by the multinational corporation, which opened the same shops in every town. Lucky for me, there was no identity to steal in my town, the shopping centers were just ugliness’ amplification. I thought it was a curse, but in Rome, I understood that it was not. Walking around all that marble beauty, the glorious churches, and the Renaissance paintings, I felt beauty crawling inside me through my eyes. Suddenly, I knew something existed to fill my emptiness.
I had longed for that revelation to become real for years until I sat in front of the Coliseum after a barefoot dancing night to sweet soul music. The lights of dawn were shining on the ancient amphitheater as I heard someone saying words of love to me. I knew it was time to let that childish memory live, so I moved to the Eternal City.
Living in Rome means you must come to terms with your idea of infinity. A crossroads in Ostiense neighbour, a spot not so known by tourists, shows that wells. You stand in the middle, turn around and see a I B.C. century pyramid tomb, a 3rd-century gate, a 1940s train station, a Rationalist building, and the water utility head office, nowadays a symbol of the city’s inefficiency. It’s an architectural timeline that tells of an empire’s rise and fall, horrendous dictatorship, modern revolution. In a few words, the humankind’s eternal struggles to survive. Living in this visible history landscape gives you heavy baggage to carry wherever you go. It makes your life a whisper in time.
It’s no surprise that generations of poets, writers and thinkers have fantasized about an apocalypse for Rome. We secretly love the idea to be the last ones on Earth because it frees us from the duty to build memories of ourselves. Living as a Roman citizen is, in fact, a constant fight to define yourself against the unshakeable memories of the world. It’s up to you to decide if you want to live to destroy or to change. I made the wrong decision at first. I came here to ruin my past, and what I was becoming through the creation of a childhood memory. As some might say, nothing is created or destroyed, but merely transformed, and Rome confirms that. She teaches me how to accept the unshakeable past and evolve. And I ask myself, is the city changing with me?
Every metropolis has an inner dualism, and Rome is no exception. While she is trying to be a more modern tech-city, her past is always calling. Take the Arrotino, for example, the rural artisans who went around town in the XX century to sharpen knives. He is still around here. Every morning you can hear him asking from his car’s speakers if you need to get your gas kitchen or your umbrella fixed. In the air full of Wi-Fi frequencies and electromagnetic waves, his friendly voice is a scream out of time.
Then, the people. Romans gave me the greatest weapon to survive anywhere: self-deprecation. Their dualism is expressed first by their way of nicely making fun of you and, less frequently, of themselves. That is their spirits, shown in lots of songs. Like Tanto Pe Canta’, one of the most famous ones in roman dialect with its melancholically but ironical lyrics about a lying first lover. But irony mixed with their unwavering conviction to still be the world’s emperor can lead to apathy and no respect.
The worldwide narrative on Rome nowadays focuses on the city’s inefficiencies. Yes, Rome has many problems, and that’s why I’m leaving for good in a few weeks. However, I will not go deeper into that for the sake of the city. You must face it: not everything or everyone evolves with you, and I admit it. I go out on my balcony on a summer sunset when the sky turns pink and look at my neighbours. I don’t know their names but I know them so well by their habits. The old patchwork-lady puts a multitexture blanket to her window to hide the living room. She spends hours looking at everybody, but if you look at her, she will quickly turn her face to protect herself too. The frightened smokers, their shutters are down night and day, and they only go outside to smoke cigarettes together with their backs against the wall. The hyperactive worker stays up till late at night, and every time he raises the shutters, his desk is in a different place. On the balcony where once a family talked and laughed together, now there is an empty chair. I ask myself what they see when they look at me. The answer surprised me because I find new habits, an authentic wholeness, and a new person. The child is finally free and it’s all because of you — my beautiful, my betrayer, tender, dirty and amusing Rome. I will love you for eternity, but now it’s time to say goodbye.

With my wife and child, I was on the way to the airport from our small suburb town Shefflield in New Zealand. This was a 60 kilometer drive, with wife and child. We are excited to go our trip to Rome: I was going to attend a conference where I would run a workshop and this trip was also a gift for my daughter for her 11th birthday she would turn in a day, when we would land in Rome.
From our neck of the woods in Sheffield, Rome is about 15,000 kilometers away. We booked our tickets through my university travel agent, and had to go for visa interview with evidence of tickets in hand, a month ahead of the trip. We would fly from Christchurch to Sydney, Australia, and would stay in the aircraft (theoretically still in transition) for about an hour, and then fly from Sydney to Dubai, roughly a fifteen hour flight. We would take the next plane from Dubai for Rome a few hours later, and after another six hours of flight, we would land in Rome. Then we would check into an apartment close to a venue; we chose the apartment hotel because we wanted to have a simple private celebration of our daughter’s birthday when we were there. In Rome, I’d conduct a workshop and participate in a few sessions for an international conference on technology assessment. As we had never visited Rome before, we were excited. This was also a first in ten years, that the three of us (our ten year old daughter, wife, and myself) would fly long distance.
So, off we hopped into our car, and drove towards the airport. Before taking the flight bound for Sydney, we would drop the car at a friend’s house. The drive from our home to the airport/friend’s house is about an hour. Wife was on the wheel, as my cell phone buzzed.
“Hi Dr. Basu, this is Siloxy, your travel agent. Suppose you are on the way to the airport?”“Yes hi Xxxy, we are on the way, will reach in about 20 minutes, so nice of you to call”“Well, er…, actually, you are bound for Sydney, en route to Dubai, right? I just called to say that we have made another arrangement for this flight as you are not taking this flight.”“Wait, what? Why?”“Sorry for this, but while you have an Australian visa, your daughter and wife do not have an Australian visa while in transit. So we had to route your trip through Auckland-Dubai route, so that you will not miss the Dubai-Rome flight”
Why did you not tell me earlier, I wondered. We had booked this ticket months in advance. Why did they not warn us then? Also, it never crossed my mind that any Government authority would ask for transit visa even if we were not to leave the aircraft (as we would not be allowed to). One of the reasons I avoided booking other flights was the hassles and expenses involved in obtaining unnecessary visas. The Indian passports we hold do not allow us visa free entry to any country in the world where we would normally travel.
I hardly had the interest and time to argue these things with the travel agent at that point. I waited as she said before hanging up that she was going to work with the Emirates people to figure out the tickets and seat allocations; we drove along. We waited at the airport for her phone call when she gave us our seat allocations and airline codes that we could get ticekts for the rest of the journey. Instead of a shorter trip by three hours, we had to go a longer route.
I marvel at the speed things get done in our age of information technology. I have a friend who leaves his digital devices at home and disconnects the moment he leaves for his travel. I, on the other hand, like to stay connected on my travel. While we were driving, someone was negotiating with the airlines authorities to arrange and re-route for a famiily of three people to fly all the way 15 thousand kilometres. As we flew rerouted Auckland and Auckland to Dubai and Dubai to Rome, we wondered but for the speed of connectivity and network, if our parents in their age would ever be able to do this. I doubt.
Thirty hours later, we landed at Leonardo Da Vinci Flumicino airport in Rome, took a bus from the airport, and then a metro line, went out of the metro tunnel. Sweating in the thirty seven degree temperature of Rome and winding through narrow footpaths, we finally reach the hotel. The hotel is a nice one, with a lobby in the front and all that. It had a tiny lift that barely fitted two adults and a child and three pieces of luggage. Then we enter the room, thirsty for a cup of coffee or a glass of water at the least. We open the room and go inside.
Nothing.
The room is a bare bones room: a couple of beds, a noisy air condition machine, but for an “apartment hotel”, it did not have glasses, and cups, plates, spoons, coffee/tea sachets, hot water kettle. None of these things. We call the reception: they politely inform us that they would not provide any of these things.
Suprise was the first element in this journey. I take it as a metaphor of life. We think and visualise life in one way, it turns out quite another. Yet we have to adjust no matter what comes our way. This is survival. When the travel agent broke the bad news that our flight had been reconfigured and we were not supposed to take the flightplan we originally thought we would, we were surprised. We were surprised because we expected everything should go as we planned in advance. When we entered the room imagining that it would have cups and plates, and spoons and we could celebrate a private birthday for our daughter as we were going to check into an apartment style hotel, we had assumptions. A lesson in life is that, we need to be flexible to adapt to circumstances and be prepared for twists and turns and surprises in life.
We crashed on the bed, and gave in to sleep after thirty hours of flight across four continents (Oceania: New Zealand, Australia, Asia, Africa, and Europe), and numerous time zones. It was well past wee hours in the morning where we originated on this journey. I went out and got ourselves pieces of sandwich and we downed them with plastic glasses of water. Not the most romantic birthday celebrations, but that was it.
Rome is a city of contrasts — on the one hand you have the grandest Basilica and The Vatican, and on the other hand, not far from Basilica, close to the Piazza Barberini lies the quiet convent of the Capucin Friars (no they didn’t invent the capuccino, although the crema on your capuccino resembles the shape of their hoods which is why you call your coffee capuccino). The monks take the oath of chastity, poverty and humility. A walk in the church reminded me of minimalism and mindfulness in another culture. Marie Condo writes in her “Life changing magic of tidying up”,
Keep only those things that speak to your heart. Then take the plunge and discard all the rest. By doing this, you can reset your life and embark on a new lifestyle.
We came out of the Capucin monastery and walked into the Metro station. It is another matter that if you take to the public transport system of Rome, you can go practically anywhere in Rome and do everything you want to do, that too, at a fraction of the price you will pay for expensive travel alternatives. If you can withstand crowd, rush, heat, inconvenience, and pickpockets, you can travel Rome like a king with pittance.
Speaking of pickpockets. Them too. The source of my second wisdom after surprise: that of mindfulness and minimalism.
So, here we were, came out of the church and walked into the metro station and then it dawned on us that we needed tickets and we forgot to purchase metro tickets from the tobacconists or tabacchis or the small knick-knack shops that sell cigarettes, among other things, for Rome is the last bastion of smokers in this world. We reach out to the ticket machine, and we find posted on the ticket machine a notice that the machine will only accept coins and not currency notes (in Euro). I take out my wallet, fish out the coins, scrounging its interiors, and purchase three tickets. A crowd has already gathered in the train station, the train is approaching. Then a rush to get in, Romans guarding the gate of the metro train. The door of the metro carriage slams shut, and the train takes off. A couple of stations down the tunnel, I feel for my pocket, and realise to my horror — my wallet is gone.
Gone. Like there is nothing there. Shunyata. Nada. Zilch.
I am stranded in a foreign country without my driver’s licence, without money, without credit and debit cards, without anything. My identity is gone, I am no one in the streets of Rome today. A vacuous feeling, a cold sweat ran down me.
I got out of the train, rush to the opposite platform, catch a train going in the other direction, and got off at the Barberini metro station, and ran down to the platform from where I boarded the first train. I asked a couple of people inside an office (that did not sell tickets but answered people’s questions I assume) if anyone has turned in a wallet.
“A what? speak in italiano per favore, we do not understand English here”, said my amio inside the dim lit office.I gesticulated that I lost my wallet and wanted to know if anyone would have turned in. They laughed at the idea. My wallet was stolen and it was gone. I should report to the carabinieri, they suggested.
The friendly carabinieri or the Italian police took an hour and a half to register the fact that my wallet with my driver’s licence, my currency notes, my credit and debit cards, were all stolen. They were sympathetic but they only spoke Italian. They ran the Google Translate to understand what I had to say in half Italian and half English (the smattering of italian I picked up before leaving for Rome on duolingo).
What did I have in my wallet?
What didn’t I?
Stacks of cards and debit/credit cards that I had not used in ages, it was a fat wallet that I cursed now and then. Photos, bits of scrap paper, coins, currency notes, old worn out American dollar bills. But why?
This is my second lesson of the trip: lead a more responsible minimalist mindful life. Get rid of the fluff in everything: speak less, produce more, avoid fluff, be minimalistic. For a wallet, for instance, just-in-time and context is the key. Rather than putting all cards, and scraps in the same wallet, digitize as much as possible. Keep just the bare minimum I need. Why do I need to carry a driver’s licence if I am not going to drive and I already have another identity card with me or another form of identity with me? At every stage, it is important to economise. Do I really need this thing? From Buddha to Leo Babauta, the message about minimising and economising and leading a more minimalistic mindful life is rife in our public domain. As much as I have read about them, I often wonder where do I slip and forget the essential lessons. The wallet was gone. I could not buy stuff I would otherwise crave for when I was on an overseas trip, but did it matter in the end? I could travel a lot freely, never again having to worry about losing my wallet. I could travel light; and most important of all, I realised how little I needed in my day to day life.
Morning of 18th June, I reach the site of my workshop on health technology assessment an hour earlier from the starting time. A couple of technicians hang around.
“Buongiorno Senor, how is it going?” I ask. They say they are hard at work since the wifi is not working in the room. I was surprised, I just turned on my Macbook and it connected pronto. What was the story? They didn’t know. Lo and behold, when I started, there was no connection to the web, and my entire workshop was based on a show and tell and then people to work on their projects. I had to change plans on the fly. Somewhere midway during the workshop, the techies proudly claimed that they solved the problem and gave me a new laptop on which they figured out the Internet connection. We worked along, with shared stories and the workshop was a lot of fun.
This was my third lesson from the trip. You have to be prepared for eventuality that falls on you. Nothing is predictable, nothing can go as planned and we have to be flexible and yet be productive as we move along life. Like the changed flightplan, like the pickpockets in the streets of Rome who left me stranded with nothing on me, and the techies who could not figure out how to connect to the Net when I needed that most.

I walked to the Vatican Museum, the night I landed in Rome. I don’t know why it was my first stop. Given who I am — gay, trans, ex-Catholic, never not mad at the Pope, etc. — I felt a little like Captain Ahab making a visit to the Museum of Whales.
Maybe that was the point. For most of my young life, “the Catholic Church” was a cloud of smoke that I moved through. It was everywhere and nowhere — a set of values, a culture, and not a place. Those values told me that I didn’t exist, or that I was bad for existing. They told me to sit still and accept pain in the name of virtue, to strangle my real self in the cradle so that people would love me.
So it was something, to just stand there, looking at a building — a place, massive brick walls, pitted white statuary above the entrance, abandoned barricades where tourists would have lined up to enter during daytime — and realize that I became myself anyway. To stare Vatican City in the face, and say: Nope. I’m still here. You missed.
There were teenagers making out in front of the barricades. This, too, felt important. Clearly, they didn’t mind that they were on the Pope’s lawn; I don’t think Romans really register the presence of Vatican City, just like I never paused to look up at the Empire…

New theories about a mystery hundreds of years old and a secret known to few Romans that was not meant to be revealed
It was 8 a.C. when the famous poet Ovid fell out of favor with the Emperor Augustus, who exiled him, without the confiscation of his goods, to Tomis (now Costance), a small port on the Black Sea.
But what was the cause of this great punishment for such a famous and important character for Rome?
Let’s try to give an answer to this question, taking into account the new theories.
Publio Ovidio Nasone was one of the most important Roman poets, one of the main exponents of Latin literature and, above all, of the elegiac poetry.
- Elegiac Poetry: lyrical composition united by specific metric form and by arguments that were opposed to the epic with a subjective and autobiographical setting, interpreted as a lament.
Ovid was the author of many works and his fame was as great during his lifetime as afterwards: his style and his themes were taken up by Dante, Petrarca, Shakespeare and many other.
His most famous work is “The Metamorphoses” whose the best known story is Apollo and Daphne’s myth.
So, what was the reason for his RELEGATIO (exile)? It still is a mystery today as the clues we have come almost exclusively from Ovid himself: what we know for sure is that the poet was exiled by the Emperor Augustus, but his successor, the Emperor Tiberius, maintained the punishment.
The fame of Ovid, as mentioned, during his life was very great and therefore the reason behind his exile must have been very serious.
Let’s see here what his “error” may have it been, according to the scholars, ‘till recent times.
- An illecit relationship with Giulia Maggiore, the daughter of the Emperor Augustus, of which he sang in the “Amores”, under the pseudonym of “Corinna”
- Perhaps he favored the relationship between Giulia Minore, granddaughter of Augustus and daughter of Giulia Maggiore, and Senator Decimo Giunio Silanus, causing them to commit the crime of adultery
- He discovered illecit dealings of Emperor Augustus at his court
- He snooped about the private conducts of Livia Drusilla, wife of Augustus
- He partecipated in a conspiracy against Tiberius
It was precisely in the year of the exile that Ovid had achieved his maximus success thanks to “The Metamorphoses”, his masterpiece, in which he recounts the transformation of the protagonists into plants, animals or objects.
Ovid was considered a libertine and wasn’t well seen by the Augustan political side, very traditionalist and conservative, because he used to criticized the two fundamental pillars of the Roman society: Religion and Family.
But it was not this that caused the exile, but something that as a punishment had the “capital punishment” which, however, Emperor Augustus commuted into exile (as Ovid himself tells us).
But it really was one of the aforementioned actions that condemned Ovid? What about the “carmina”?
As mentioned before, the reason we have listed ahve been proposed by scholars until recently, almost forgetting the “carmina” implied and the fact that this could be connected to the “error” and not be a separate thing.
At the time of his exile, Ovid was writing the “Fasti”, an epic poem aimed at revisiting Roman festivals and rites: there would have been 12 books, one for each month of the year.
Halfway through the work, the order for the RELEGATIO arrived and the work was interrupted, nver to be resumed again.
- A clue -
At the beginning of the fifth book, where the poet researches the etymological origins of the name of the month of May and at a certain point, Ovid has the Muse Calliope (the poetry’s muse) tell the backgrounds of Rome’s foundation and she speaks of the constellation of the Pleiades.
In Latin literature, the importance that Ovid gave to this constellation when speaking about Rome’s origin is unusual: no one before him had mentioned neither Maia nor teh Pleiades in this context.
Certainly Ovid would never have allowed himself to invent something extraneous to the tradition regarding the birth of Rome (neither did the non-romans writers or Rome’s enemies).
- Was, therefore, a forbidden subject that Ovid wrote about? -
We must now take a step back and tell talk about an event that took place about 100 years earlie: the story of Quinto Valerio Sorano who was senteced to death for revealing the secret name of Rome.
Servius and Plutarch too wrote of the sacrilege commited by Soranus, a tribune of the plebs, poet and grammarian of vast erudition, dear friend of Cicero, whose sentence was death by crucifixion.
A certain reason, that we know for sure, for which the Romans kept the real name of the Urbe (other latin name for Rome) hidden and secret is the EVOCATIO (evocation), a rite for which the patron god of a city was invoked, pronouncing its name, in front of its walls during a siege: knowing the name of the god was the equivalent to seizing the essence of the city and subduing it.
- The Pleiades -
The Pleiades are a cluster of stars located in the constellation of Taurus, 440 light years away from the Earth and includes about 3000 stars, but the eye can see only 6 to 12 of them.
These stars are mentioned by many ancient peoples and it is considered that they thought there were 7 of them. They are found depicted in the Nebra Disc, the oldest surviving depiction of the night sky, dating back to 1600 b.C. .
Also according to the Greeks, the Pleiades were 7: Daughters of Atlas and Pleirone (daughter of Tetis and Ocean) their names were “Alcione and Merope, Celeno and Taigete, Elettra and Sterope, together with the most holy Maia”. (Cicero, “Aratea”)
At this point a consideration needs to be made.
In the ancient world what was sacred on earth was often a reflection of what was in the sky: for example, Mount Taigete (Sparta) took its name from the Pleiade mother of Sparta’s “founder”, Lacedaemon.
Here, as the Roman encyclopedist Marcus Terentium Varro: “Where now stands Roma, there was once the Septimountius, so called for the number of mountains that the city later included within its walls.”
We know that the Septimountius does not correspond to the Seven Hills of Rome, but the concept of the Seven Hills could itself be the result of a schematization that reduced the number of the hills of the territory that extends on the left bank of the Tiber.
This semplification would seem pointless, but perhaps the aim was to make the hills correspond to the Seven Pleiades; in fact, even the arrangement of the hills seems to respect that of the “seven stars pleiades”.
The Palatine Mount, on which Romulus traced the furrow of the Urbe, corresponds to “the most holy Maia”.
In the story of the foundation, we find another probable allusion to the Pleiades: Remus on the Aventine Mount and Romulus on Palatine Mount saw, respectively, 6 and 12 bird flying (as mentioned 6 and 12 are the Pleiades visible from the Earth by eye).
We must remember that the Pleaides are part of the constellation of Taurus, whose zodiac sign begins on April 21st… The foundation of Rome has as date April 21st 753 b.C. .
It cannot be excluded that even the number of the Seven King of Rome originated, rather than from a historical foundation, from the need for sacred numerology in which the number “seven” holds a prominent place.
A small detail to keep in mind, is that Ovid was originally from Sulmona, a city at the feet of the Maiella Mountain Massif, consacrated preciselt to the Pleaide Maia.
It is therefore possible that an educated Roman, starting from the passage written by Ovid, was able to understand that the city born from Romulus’ furrow, was consecrated to the Pleiade Maia, considered by Ovid himself, the most beautiful one.
For the ancient Romans, the Lares were divinities who protected and safeguarded the individual, the family and the home. The divinity that is introduced in the verses is called “Bona Dea” (good goddess) and it too had a protective function.
Even the real name of the “Bona Dea” was never to be spoken; the first to reveal it, was Macrobius in the V century a.C. by whuch time the pagan world was almost at an end.
Macrobius confirms that behind the “Bona Dea” was hidden Maia.
It is therefore no coincidence that Ovid dedicates the opening line of the book of and about May to her.
The sentence in the graphic specifies a relationship between Vulcan and Maia, in which the god offered a pregnant sow as a sacrifice to Maia, every 1st of May, so that the earth would be pregnant with fruit.
Vulcan represented the protective fire; this places him at Maia’s service in the defense of the city.
The juxtaposition between Maia and the “Bona Dea” allows us to see from a new perspective an episode that took place decades earlier, which involved, among others, Cicero and Cesare.
P. Clodio. Pulcro, one of the most discussed characters in the entire Roman history, on the night of the 4th of December in 62 b.C., disguised himself as a woman to secretly participate in a very secret ritual of the cult of the “Bona Dea” to which the women of the aristocracy were responsible, which was carried out privately in the residence of a high magistrate’s wife and in the presence of the latter and the Vestals (thus indicates the importance of this rite): that night the rite took place in the home of Cesare, that at the time was Pontifex Maximus.
Pulcro was discovered and underwent a trial in which he risked the death penalty, whilst against him testified Cicero.
Cesare, who as Pontifex Maximus, was one of the few who knew the truth about Rome’s secret name, divorced his wife after that deplorable episode. This shows how important the rite was.
If naming the true patroness of Rome was such a serious crime, why didn’t Augustus kill Ovid?
Calliope’s speech seems to have been cut: in fact, she never mentions Romulus, while the other two muses whom Ovid makes speak before her, do it.
It is therefore possible that Emperor Augustus had the compromised verses eliminated. Those were the verses in which it was stated that Romulus gave the secret name to Rome (a fact present in many latin and non-latin sources), following the prophecy on the place where Rome would be born.
In conclusion, Emperor Augustus granted clemency because Ovid, it seems, never mentioned Maia’s name directly.
But there were, probably, also political reasons for this choice.

AOG, Sitges
Word of advice number one: when you next go on vacation, don’t wear new shoes on the flight.
Why? Well, it could be that the airline looses your luggage and you are doomed to wear the same pair of new shoes for days on end. And your feet will not forgive you.
Word of advice number two: Never, ever, go to Rome in August. Not if you value your life and well being in general. And especially not if you are adverse to high temperatures.
Our friends had warned us against this.
“Don’t go, it is too hot!”, they said.
“Never in August. You’ll die from the heat!”, they warned.
Did we listen? Well, of course not.
Our logic?
“Well, we always say we won’t go in August and that we’ll go some other time, but then we never go”, said my partner. I agreed. My partner was right. We always say we’ll go some other time, but then we never do.
So a couple of years ago we decided to go to Rome and check out the Eternal City.
E t e r n a l mistake on our part!
After paying Vueling Airlines (a low cost airline) for 2 pieces of luggage, we arrived at Rome’s Fiumicino Airport with a slight delay, but no suitcases.
We only discovered this after waiting for our bags for over an hour at belt #9.
I went to the baggage handling company in charge of our flight (turns out there’s more than one. Blessed capitalism!) and they told us they had no record of our bags on their system.
Yes, having been to the country in the past, in fact, as recently as last June, my first thought was “typical Italian efficiency”, but I was wrong to think that. The problem was not typical Italian efficiency, it was typical Spanish negligence.
As we would find out the next day, the bags had never left Barcelona.
The Italian handler made us fill a form; he put our details into the computer, and sent us off on our less than merry way with a reference number which, we would later discover, was incorrect.
Although no consolation at all, we were not the only people without luggage on our flight, there was, at least, one other.
So there we were at Rome’s airport with a driver waiting to take us into town for 50 Euros, something we thought would be a good idea since we didn’t know the city and we wanted not to worry about the bags.
He was very nice, and if he was upset at having waited for over an hour, he didn’t let on.
We got into his Ford Focus and made our way to the Città Eterna.
I have to say that the drive went pretty well, and that the country side was not exactly very pretty. It was, all in all, a bit odd.
First we were on a highway, then, after a while, we found ourselves in what can only be describe as ‘leafy suburbs’.
He didn’t take any major roads and, instead, chose one-way roads with large, tall, walls, behind which I can only imagine must hide beautiful private villas.
It was a long while before we approached something which resembled the outskirts of a large city.
Once there what we saw first was the usual dim urban landscape, typical of any major European city post 1950.
Large, ugly, square, brick and concrete buildings, with many stores along the way selling mostly urban goods: fast food joints, urban clothing stores, ugly furniture shops, and the odd newspaper stand.
Still, we were excited to be in Rome.
I mean, R O M E !!
Right?
Then, suddenly, something which would happen again and again -though we didn’t know it at the time- occurred: when we least expected it, and just before we entered a tunnel, out of the corner of our left eyes, we caught a glimpse of St. Peter’s, in The Vatican.
This was unexpected because we had thought that we would view that particular monument going up the Via Della Concilliazione and into St. Peter’s Square, like almost everyone else.
But it was not to be. We quickly crossed the Tiber and drove down the Corso Vittorio Emanuelle II and into our hotel near the Campo de Fiori.
We paid our driver, gave him a tip, then checked in.
The hotel was ok. The recepcionist was not really friendly and did that thing which so often happens in Europe, he spoke as if HE was doing you a favor.
As if HE was paying for you to stay at the hotel. Not rude, just a bit…what’s the word… condescending and aloof.
Regardless, we had gone to Rome to enjoy the place and that is what we wanted to do. So we quickly forgot about him.
We had asked for a room with a balcony, and they gave us that, which was nice. But we soon discovered that the a/c was, well, less than able. It made a lot of noise, but gave out little cold air. But I would only realize this later in the day. And especially so at night.
We were starving by now and wanted to a) see the city and b) get some clothes. We had nothing to wear. Only the clothes we had on and which, by now, were very sweaty. Did I mention Rome was hot?
We left the hotel, which was, it seemed, used to situations such as ours. “You’ll get your bags tomorrow”, said the receptionist/owner, and off we went to eat and do some shopping.
We found a small restaurant about 3 minutes away and sat down. We ordered one pizza for the both of us and something to drink. It was the best pizza we would have during the whole trip. It was that good.
The service, however, was pretty bad. I wouldn’t say it went downhill from there, but rather that the service in Rome was consistently bad day in, day out.
Our waiters over the next few days, it would seem, would find new and creative ways in which to outdo their colleague’s ‘performance’ throughout our stay. And no, we hardly spent a penny on tips while in Rome.
So, after having lunch and stopping off at the local grocery shop where we got basic eating and drinking supplies, as well as some toiletries, it was back to the hotel, quick shower, and out before the stores closed.
Rome was baking under the sun, and us with it.
Out we went into the Corso Vittorio Emanuele II and started walking East, with no particular place to go. Also, we didn’t really know which way to go. We were torn between wanting to see the sights, and our clothing needs, so we tried to concentrate very little on what we saw, hard to do since if you’ve never been to Rome, everything is new to you, even when nine or ten centuries old. Or more.
Eventually, we got to Via del Corso, but not before we stumbled on the Piazza Venezia and the enormous marble and stone behemoth to our right: the monument to King Vittorio Emanuele II, first King of Italy.
This is one of the monuments on my list which I would not really arrive at the way I had expected. When I say we stumbled, I mean it. It is gigantic, but it is not exactly by a major road, it is on a major square, but off to the right, so if you happen to be on the street and not turn right, you might not exactly see it. But then, once you do, you can’t see anything else.
I wanted to go to it (yes, its array of classical columns was calling me) and bask in its classical ‘interpretative’ colossal beauty, but it was not to be on that first day.
We had no time, it was hot, and we needed clothes.
We turned into the Via del Corso, and forgot about it.
Via del Corso is one of those major shopping streets in central Rome. Many of the major brands, and others not so major, are there. Although Rome’s high class shopping strip is the Via Condotti, which is further down the Via del Corso, to the right.
On the corner, just as you go into Corso, there is the Doria-Pamphilj Palace.
Serene and decorated in a wedding cake style, I was immediately drawn to it.
But didn’t go, and would, unfortunately, not get to go during the trip.
And that pretty much sums up the entire trip. I didn’t get to see, go or do many things.
So back to the Via del Corso, and our shopping. We had nothing to wear the next day, and clothes were urgently needed. So we spent the best part of the afternoon traipsing from store to store, looking for garments, and missing out on Rome altogether.
On a side note, I must point out that, by now, my partner and I were wondering how the people of Italy reproduced since, it was very obvious, all the men in that country were gay.
But I digress…Clothes-wise, our main hope turned out to be H&M, but, once we got there, almost at the end of the Corso, we discovered, much to our dismay, that there was no Men’s section there.
Can you believe it?
We had walked the entire length of the Corso in the hope of finding a place which might have something -overpriced- but my size. Fat chance.
Since at that point we were only about two blocks from the Piazza del Popolo, we decided to go there.
I have to say that by now, I was ready to be impressed, or something, and impressed I was.
I had long wanted to see the twin churches of Santa Maria in Montesanto (1662-75) and Santa Maria dei Miracoli (built 1675-79). And there they were, in all their Baroque beauty. I think this is the one time Rome got interesting that day. I would say it made the whole thing worthwhile, but it isn’t true.The day had sucked all along from the minute our luggage went missing. But that moment, when we walked into that space, covered in fatigue and sweat, the city seemed beautiful, the tourists a mere nuisance, the heat (and it was around 8:30 PM) almost tolerable.
It was magic. Rome was magic.
We stopped at the obelisk in the middle of the Piazza, an original comission of Sety I (later erected by Rameses II) from Heliopolis which stands in the centre of the Piazza, inside a fountain, and is the second oldest and one of the tallest obelisks in Rome (some 24 m high, or 36 m including its plinth).
It was brought to Rome in 10 BC by order of Augustus and originally set up in the Circus Maximus.
Once there, a tourist girl asked her friend if she could drink from the fountain. My partner overheard her and told her that he’d read that you could drink from any fountain in Rome, unless it specifically said not to.
She was happy about this, and we spoke with her for a couple more minutes. Turns out she was from Spain, and was there on holiday with a couple more friends from school. She must have been in her very early 20s. And she was lovely.
It was starting to get dark, and we decided to get back to the hotel. We couldn’t decide between catching a bus, taking the subway, or walking. So we walked back along the dark and not too busy streets of, as it turns out, downtown Rome. Soon we were back at the hotel, where there were no news about our luggage.
The hotel’s concierge really couldn’t care less, so we went to our room, had a shower and went out to have dinner, not too sure about where to do this.
We decided to follow the incoming crowd down one of the streets, and ended up at the Campo dei Fiori. It was teeming with life: children playing, musicians, flower vendors, Indian or Pakistani salesmen of trinkets.
In short, Touristland right there in front of us. The only Italians being the waiters at the Campo’s many restaurants. So in we walked, and decided that the one on the right, on the other side of La Carbonara Restaurant, where we should have dined, just as you walked in, would do. Mistake. The food, although ok once we got it, did not surpass the bad service of a place which doubled as a drinks bar and dance club after 11PM.
We kept getting food meant for other tables, everything arrived at odd intervals, drinks had to be ordered more than twice. In short, a mess.
But given the day’s big story, it really paled in comparison. We didn’t mind much that the service was so bad. I think we were relieved it was over more than anything else!
Afterwards, we went for a walk on the Tiber, and saw that, at night, it really came alive. What a beautiful city this is.
It seems like the good citizens of Rome have allowed for bars and stands to be set up alongside the banks of the river. We were immediately drawn by the music and the bright, intermitent, lights of the marquees.
We crossed the bridge, and went down to the riverbank. We saw a couple of small stands which were a sort of Godsend since they had one of the items we needed most: a phone charger!
Yes, ours were safely (we hoped) stored inside our suitcases, and these, somewhere in Europe. We then decided to go to one of the “bars”. A rugby-themed bar by the side of the Tiber showing New Zealand’s Rugby matches.
Yes, slightly surreal, but then Rome is slightly surreal.
We would have stayed longer, but we were beat. We had had a long day and were yearning for sleep.
So after a couple of drinks, we headed back to the hotel. The room was not exactly cold, although the imitation a/c had been on all afternoon, so we agreed to sleep with the balcony window open. And the air con on. So our first day in Rome ended.

An Italian Summer — Part I
This is Part I of my travelogue An Italian Summer — starting with the eternal city of Rome.
Rome was not built in a day. No surprises — it took us four days to visit it and we were left wanting for more.
Rome is a veritable explosion of ancient history, art and culture. That also means it is thronged by enthusiastic tourists throughout the summer, and it is wise to plan in advance in order to avoid long queues and inconvenience.
The central location of our hotel — the Westin Excelsior — ensured we could reach most places of interest on foot, and get public transport for the others with ease. You will spend a lot of time outdoors in Rome, so choose location over amenities while picking a place of stay.
Let me walk you through our itinerary, answering some of the why’s and what’s alongwith.
We landed in Rome past noon-time on 3rd September and got ourselves a local SIM card and picked up our Roma Pass at the Airport.
There are a lot of posts on the internet debating whether the Roma pass is a good investment. Unless you are planning to vegetate at the Hotel, it is a no-brainer. It includes entry to the Colosseum & Forum, plus unlimited access to the public transport (Metro & Bus).
Get a cab from the Airport to the city centre, usually costs about €50–60. We freshened up at the Hotel, got ourselves a light lunch and started walking where our feet would take us.
The evening brought about an array of flavours. We ambled across the cobbled streets, got hold of every photo-op against pretty street cafes, saw miniature and life-size versions of wooden Pinocchios, and got our first lick of authentic Italian Gelato.
By the way, amidst all this, we also saw the Trevi fountain and climbed up the Spanish steps and saw a lovely sunset with a street musician singing Ed Sheeran in the background. The city of Rome is a gigantic museum — you just cannot stay away from history and architectural beauty.
We trooped back to the hotel early. Streets in Rome get rather desolate by about 9 pm, and roaming around on foot is not advisable.
The Roma pass includes priority access to the Colosseum (€18, otherwise). However, the authorities have placed a concurrent visitors restriction due to which one must also reserve a time slot at a cost of €2 per person here.
We had a slot for 12 noon so we had a relaxed start to the day. We had breakfast this day, and also the next 2 days, at this handy cafe called Xtra One Coffee at Via Lombardia. At our designated time, we entered the Colosseum through a priority channel, smirking at the long queues sweating it out for an entry. GET PRIORITY ENTRY EVERYWHERE YOU GO!
It is an awe-inspiring visual as one enters the colossal stadium. Though, thanks to repair work in arena area, there were steel scaffolds which ruined the authenticity of the surroundings. We plugged into Rick Steves’ audio tour as we entered and, while listening to its ‘bloody’ past, we roamed around its many tiers.
After a wholesome tour, we stepped out across the road to Ristoro Della Salute. And we were back in the queue for the Roman Forum by half past two. We spent a good half an hour waiting here (there’s no skipping this line). But it was well worth it.
Having read Julius Caesar as part of my ICSE syllabus, I was thrilled to be where it all transpired. The Via Sacra, Caesar’s grave, the Rostrum where Cicero and Antony spoke, the Vestal Virgins — it was like reading a book. and Rick Steves’ guide did complete justice to the experience, yet again.
Our next stop was the adjacent Palatine Hill (that’s where the word palace comes from) housing lush gardens and remnants of Rome’s glorious history. To be honest, if one intends to get into the details of the monuments scattered on this hill as well, it would be hard to do it the same day as the Colosseum and the Forum. The place shuts at 6pm, a fact that deprived us of a potentially lovely sunset from a vantage point situated inside.
After a long day, we headed to the nearby Gran Caffe Martini & Rossi to get an early dinner and some Sangria. What followed ranks among our top memories from the trip: a view of the Colosseum by night. That surreal picture summed up almost everything anyone asks for from Rome.
And that was Day 2.
This was our day of casual ‘walking around the city’ in between visits to the Colosseum and to the Vatican the day after. The idea was not to burn ourselves out in the first few days of the trip.
Rick Steves came to our rescue again. We picked up his walking guide “Heart of Rome” and headed out on the streets of Rome with our backpacks.
A bus ride from Bissolati to C.so Vittorio Emanuele, and we were at our first stop — Campo de’ Fiori, a lively market square with a dark history of public execution.
The colorful, busy market made for a great start. From here, we meandered through tourist laden streets, with historical nuggets strewn all around, to a centerpiece of Baroque art and architecture — Piazza Navona. The vast plaza is adorned with three majestic fountains including Bernini’s Fountain of Four Rivers, and Boromini’s imposing church facing them.
It was lunch time. While the piazza is lined with restaurants, we resisted the obvious options and walked into one of the adjacent lanes, and didn’t regret it one bit. As we walked the Via di Tor Milina, we bumped into merry accordion players, street bands playing with gusto and enthusiastic restaurant waiters offering us a ‘better’ deal. We chose a place closest to the music and downed some food with a serving of the much talked about Aperol Spritz.
With a fuller belly, we moved on to the iconic Pantheon, a monument preserved exceedingly well for its ~1900 year old history. Rick Steves has a dedicated audio tour of the Pantheon — you don’t need any guide thanks to that.
From here, Rick Steves was egging us to head to the familiar Trevi & Spanish steps area, so we looked beyond. Close to the Pantheon lies Largo di Torre Argentina, an important ruin and site of the murder of Julius Caesar — the senate was meeting across town on the day he was slain. Close to this was the Campidoglio — a hilltop square designed by Michelangelo with a statue of Marcus Aurelius on his horse marking the center and facades of conservatories marking its periphery. We spent some time visiting some of the relics housed in these buildings. These are covered under the Roma pass and could consume a good two hours if you are really into ancient relics.
Stepping out of the Campidoglio, we walked up the Altar of the Fatherland built in honor of Victor Emanuelle II in the early 20th century and boasting of an impressive facade. We could only spent about 20 minutes here since they evacuate tourists at 6pm.
Late evening took us back to the Spanish steps (a steep climb again!) and then to the Trevi fountain for a night time view which is highly recommended. We had an early start for the Vatican next day and we hadn’t really gotten rid of the jet lag, so this ended up to be another early night.
We had booked an escorted priority entrance to the Vatican on headout.com at 8am! While Vatican is accessible by train (Ottavio metro station), we took a cab and grabbed breakfast on the way. We made it in the nick of time only to be told that we were the only 2 people booked for the slot, and we could wait 30 minutes and join a full guided tour with 6–7 other folks, at no extra cost. w00t w00t!
Surely, the Gods had intervened. I have rarely ever gone for human guides, but the Vatican is a giant maze and it is highly recommended to book a full tour. It helped that our guide was knowledgeable and witty to match.
Keep a good 3–4 hours for a full tour of the Vatican, the Sistine Chapel and St. Peter’s Basilica (perhaps more if you want to climb up the Basilica’s steps to the dome). Even as you step out to the Vatican square, the plaza looks resplendent with fountains and an array of statues lining the surrounding buildings’ rooftops. Covering your knees and shoulders is advisable.
As we stepped out of the Vatican, we spotted a McDonald’s and that was lunch because, well, we needed a break from pizza & pasta. Already.
Before heading to Trastevere for our last evening in Rome, we did a detour to the Chiesa di Santa Maria della Vittoria which houses Bernini’s sculpture The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa — a statue you might remember from Dan Brown’s Angels & Demons. It is a church as grand as any other and an item checked off the bucket-list.
Trastevere is the trans-Tiber section of Rome. Due to its quaint and bohemian buildings and houses, Trastevere is pretty Instagram-friendly. There is an audio tour by Rick Steves on Trastevere as well, and we spent the first hour or so getting to know the history of the commune, walking the neighbourhood, and visiting the Church of Cecilia & that of Santa Maria.
It was Friday evening and weekend revelry was in the air. We passed a number of piazzas where locals had got together to enjoy some food, drinks and music. As the evening set in, we went back to Piazza Trilussa and saw an exhilarating band performance. Ponte Sisto — the bridge in front of the Piazza was also abuzz with street artists and beat boxers. It was a far cry from the vibe of central Rome, and it won’t be far-fetched to say that this was indeed the Heart of Rome.
We found a quieter alley for dinner at a fine restaurant called Latteria Trastevere. And with a long-ish goodbye walk, we boarded the tram from Trastevere to Venezia, where, to our surprise, there was a traffic stop due to a night marathon. So, we had to wait for half an hour under the Roman night-sky before taking a cab back to the hotel.
It was our last night there. We weren’t complaining.
Rome is a city that keeps giving. Every day spent, even visits to the same sites, at times, offered us a fresh perspective or a yet-unseen relic.
It is a modern capital city with its roots firmly planted in its past — be it the well-maintained ancient monuments, the social piazzas or the water pumps providing water to passersby — each one of them telling tales from a history as old as time itself.

January 4, 2022|Italy
As expected, very late last night, Boo and I got our test results back for the PCR tests we took late yesterday afternoon. Negative for COVID. So yay!
Except . . . when I went to wake up Boo this morning, she told me that during the night, she had a headache and sore throat. She had taken ibuprofen and the symptoms went away And she felt fine this morning.
So we went about our day as planned. We took a walking tour through Ancient Rome. We met the group near Trajan’s column then walked past ”the wedding cake,” the monument to the king who united Italy.
Our guide was OK. Informative but not that entertaining. On the upside, he didn’t sing, so that was a blessing.
The guide took us up the hill behind the wedding cake where we had a glorious view over the rooftops of Rome. We were there at the stroke of noon, so we could hear bells peal across the city.

I first visited Rome back in 2015, and it remains my favourite European city to this day.
Mainstream, I know. “What’s your favourite song, Wonderwall?”, I hear you ask.
Well, no (although I do love Oasis). Just hear me out.
I’m a firm believer that Rome’s reputation has suffered because it’s so popular. It’s as though people refuse to judge the city on its merit, so widespread is the knowledge of its undeniable appeal. Sometimes it’s important to take a step back, and to try and refresh one’s perspective.
I often struggle with cities. I don’t understand the appeal of London, living some 90 minutes away from it myself, and I’ve found the energy of big cities a little oppressive at various times in my life.
That wasn’t the case in Rome, though.
Down every street, and round every corner, there’s something to marvel at — some unwavering reminder of what our species has achieved, and how it has evolved.

The day out of Levanto was an early morning because of the train tickets we’d booked in Venice. We took a regional train to La Spieza, south of Cinque Terre and then a direct train to Rome. This train was different in that it had booths of 6 seats each. I asked Yuki if she felt like she was going to Hogwarts.
We arrived in Rome and had to walk 2km to the Airbnb apartment. We were surprised that a city steeped in such history would be covered in so much graffiti. It covers a lot of buildings, most train cars, all municipal work vehicles, and any spot like tunnels or under bridges that are easily accessible and discrete. At the same time, the cobblestone streets made it difficult to drag our suitcases and the narrow sidewalks littered with garbage were a constant obstacle course. For all the problems, it is perhaps surprising that the drivers almost always stop for you to cross the road if you step out in front of them. They don’t try to ignore you or speed behind you like in Canada. So at first we were hesitant to cross the road but soon became accustomed to finding a break in traffic and forcing the next car to slow down and stop for us.
We were pleasantly surprised that the Airbnb apartment was actually a one bedroom place and that we got our own room again.
Probably my favourite part of Rome is that there are ruins everywhere. We went out to see one attraction and on our way to finding a subway line we stumbled upon the Piazza di Porta Maggorie. There is a tram station beside the ruins of what use to be Rome’s old city wall where an aqueduct cuts through at 30m high and one of the gates to the city was a tomb to a slave that was freed and became wealthy as a baker.
Further on we walked beside the remains of an aqueduct, one of 11 that use to feed the 1 million inhabitants of ancient Rome. The aqueduct and city walls have openings which have roads going through them. Some of them are the original gates repurposed for roads but others are just large demolitions cut out of the wall.
Our attraction of the day was the Spanish Steps, located in the North East of the city. Photos made it look appealing but when we arrived around dinner time the square was packed with tourists and the stairs had become a de facto public bench. We walked up and read that the stairs were significant for connecting two parts of town at different elevations. Otherwise, there isn’t much to them and we were less impressed.
Surprisingly, we found a family run restaurant with an enthusiastic and very happy greeter and waiter. This fun meal would be an abnormally of our time in Rome where the restaurant was happy, joked around, and cared about the service and food that they served. For the remainder of our time in Rome, we would have difficulty finding good food and service.
Our day of sight seeing in Rome began later than expected but we took a tram and one of two subway lines to the Colosseum. There are hawkers everywhere trying to get you to join a tour group. They offered entrance in the next few minutes for 30 euros and said that the line was 2hr. In reality, the line was about half an hour and admission without any guide costs 11 Euro. It would seem, however, that tour groups would be the normal for all of Italy. Everywhere we went, we were mobbed by tourist groups, whether formed by a company or a sole person at the entrance. Some of the larger attractions also have self-guided audio tours and many people can be found standing awkwardly around the attraction holding half of a phone up to their ear.
Needless to say, Yuki and I didn’t use any guides. This meant that we didn’t actually learn anything while visiting the historic sites as there aren’t really any display boards. The only learning we did was by reading up on wikipedia after the fact.The tour groups looked slow and the tour guides seemed to drone on and on so it was nice to be able to go at our own pace and wander around instead of being stuck to a set path.
I wasn’t all that impressed by the Eiffel tower in Paris but the Colosseum was massively impressive. Stepping out of the metro station, the scale and size of the Colosseum is enormous. Even in ruin, it is wonderful in shape and form. From the outside, the form of the Colosseum is beautiful, with each successive arch and while deteriorated and broken, it is easy to image how much grandeur there would have been back in ancient Rome.
Entering the Colosseum was also spectacular. It is interesting to note that tickets to events at the Colosseum were free but seating was arranged by social standing with the wealthiest at the lower bowl and the poor, furthest at the top. Each of the arches at the base of the Coliseum was an entrance that lead directly to the intended seats. This eliminated cross contamination between social classes but also was incredibly efficient in moving people in and out of the stadium.
We walked around the lower bowl for photos and peered down into the galleries below the originally wood arena. The signboards said how there use to be mock naval battles but stopped after a renovation. it wasn’t clear if that renovation had to do with adding the basement or a perimeter wall. I cannot imagine how they would be able to flood the arena with a wood floor and not only support the weight of the water but also be waterproof at the same time.
After the Colosseum we had to wander around for a bit to find a place to eat, which was the normal Italian food, and then we sat outside the Basilica di San Pietro for a while because they close for lunch. Of note, there are some religious artifacts, including chains that held Saint Peter and a statue of Moses by Michelangelo. There were also some other tombs adored with skeletons which we found odd and the roof had a nice painting on it.
Then we walked back to the Coliseum to visit the adjacent Roman Forums. The ticket to the Colosseum includes the Roman Forums and Palatine Hill across the street. This is where the Roman government buildings were located and is nearby to a wealthy neighbourhood. What is most impressive about the forums is the height of some of the ruins, indicating that some buildings were huge.
The Forums are mostly ruins now but I was struct by how a much of it is brick. It seems that the romans built predominantly in brick and covered the structures in a concrete paste or marble. I’d known about the romans and concrete before but I didn’t realize that it was used as mortar between bricks and not contemporary concrete with aggregates and moulds. Only certain buildings, or parts of buildings, are constructed from stone.
By the end of the forums we were too tired to walk up Palatine Hill so we planned on coming back the next day because the tickets are valid for two consecutive days.
The next item on our list of places to visit was Trevi Fountain. We found a shop before the fountain where we bought postcards for 0.4 euro each. We thought this was pretty good because they can be as high as 1 and are usually 0.5 or above but we found another store later that had them for 0.3 euro. Oh well.
The fountain is probably the most photographed in Rome. It was also crowded and so it felt like a lot of the other attractions where we only had enough time to get in, take our photos, and get out. There didn’t seem to be any time to appreciate or enjoy each place, especially with the crowds.
From Trevi fountain we walked to the Pantheon, passing the Piazza Colonna, which is significant because the tall round marble Column of Marcus Aurelius recounts the conquest of the Emperor in relief carvings that spiral up to a statue at the top.
The Pantheon was as large as I’d expected it to be and enormously voluminous inside. Looking at the roof, we knew that the square recesses were to reduce the weight of the roof but we wondered instead why the roof couldn’t be thinner. Like the Colosseum and the Roman Forums, the exterior was all brick. Apparently it used to be faced in marble but over the centuries that was scavenged away.
After the Pantheon we walked to the Piazza Navonna which has another impressive, but smaller fountain. We took a peak inside the Saint Agnese but there was a Sunday service in progress and the space was surprisingly small, although ordinate.
We had our worst lunch lunch afterwards at a restaurant just outside the square. The service was terrible and the food wasn’t that great either. The worst part was that the waiter tried to take 5 euros tip from us and I had to yell at him to get all our money back. For hearing that Paris waiters were snobs, we didn’t have a problem there and found that Italy was generally much worse in the tourist areas but very good in the local parts.
We were going to take the bus back to Palatine Hill but we couldn’t find a place to buy tickets so we decided to cheap out and just walk back. Along the way we stopped at the Piazza Venezia and took photos of the Altare della Patria. This monument is a modern symbol to the city of Rome and has some newer statues.
There are a lot of steps to climb on the way up and the view from the top is okay, but not great. It’s possible to go to the top by elevator but it cost 7 euro and we didn’t think it was worthwhile. In some ways, this building gives an idea to the grandeur of ancient Rome and what it must have been like in the past.
At the edge of the Roman Forums we realized that we’d forgotten yesterday’s tickets so we weren’t able to get back in. Instead we walked around to the Circuit Maximus but I was disappointed to find a sloping field with barely any trace of a race course. The Circuit Maximus use to be the largest chariot race track in the Roman Empire and was also used for many ceremonies and parades. Today, it could be mistaken for an undeveloped site as there’s nothing but a walking path.
For dinner we tried to go to Sushi but it was a high class place with a long line up. Instead we went to a take-away shop but it took an hour for them to prepare it. Still, Yuki got her much desired sushi and we have a good dinner at home of the type of food we wanted to eat.
Yuki’s Dad wanted to visit the Vatican so we went there. It took us a long time to get through security because I picked the wrong line. There was a mass of people that split into four lines. The first two lines had a security checkpoint each but the second two lines funneled into a single checkpoint. We were in the second line and the people around us were quite aggressive to get to the front of each other.
Saint Peter’s Basilica, had been described to us as a lot of dead saints. Like all the other religious sites, it was highly decorated in gold paintings and large but wasn’t that interesting to us. Turns out, there are a lot of dead saints. We considered visiting the Sistine Chapel but it seemed far and likely to have a long line so we walked through the Basilica’s grotto and then went for lunch.
Everyone looked forward to lunch at McDonalds because it is a dependable staple to be the same everywhere in the world. At least, almost the same. The taste was slightly different but it was a welcome relief to all the plain food we’ve been having lately. We never thought that we would be so eager to eat at McDonalds for lunch.
The last place to visit in Rome was the Baths of Caracalla which we discovered was very close to the Circuit Maximus we visited the day before. We had to transfer between the two subway lines at the Rome train station so we also used that opportunity to buy tickets for Yuki’s parents to get to the airport as they would be going alone the next day. As with all things family related, it took a lot of explaining in three different languages to get the message through to her Dad who speaks English and Japanese and her mom who speaks Japanese and Thai. Yuki’s patience seem almost angelic for all the explaining and translating she has to do.
Frustratingly, the Baths closed early on Monday so we walked to them for nothing. Frances, who had visited Rome in August, recommended going to the Pyramide metro station and Eatalia, a department store of restaurants. It turned out to be a station beyond Pyramide so we had a tiresome walk and the building was actually more of an expensive health food store. There were three levels with restaurants but the main business was selling healthy foods and the restaurants looked posh. Dejected, we backtracked to a Ramen restaurant we’d passed walking there and ate a small early dinner because we were all still full on McDonalds for lunch.

The OUP blog has an excerpt from Bryan Ward-Perkin’s The Fall of Rome.
It is currently deeply unfashionable to state that anything like a ‘crisis’ or a ‘decline’ occurred at the end of the Roman empire, let alone that a ‘civilization’ collapsed and a ‘dark age’ ensued. The new orthodoxy is that the Roman world, in both East and West, was slowly, and essentially painlessly, ‘transformed’ into a medieval form. However, there is an insuperable problem with this new view: it does not fit the mass of archaeological evidence now available…
The Fall of Rome is one of these things that varies from whatever perspective you take. I remember my Roman lecturer on my BA commenting that many historians felt Rome went into terminal decline during the third century. Over two hundred years, he dryly noted, must have been some decline. The British Empire has collapsed in the last century, are we walking in the ruins of a one mighty empire?
Yet Ward-Perkins is right. There is a change. Pottery becomes pretty cruddy stuff. Writing becomes much much rarer. Civic centres fall. If civilisation is living in cities, then there is definitely a collapse of civilisation. While it might not be visible over the course of a lifetime, it is there. It depends what questions you ask of the data. The grand durée of history doesn’t disappear simply because the individual becomes the fashionable thing to study in the Thatcherite era.
I remember being taught that Saxons didn’t really invade, they came over as farmers. The Vikings didn’t invade either, they were peaceful farmers with a bad press. It makes you wonder how and why a lot of weapons came to be invented with all these peaceful farmers going everywhere. Perhaps an understanding of barbarians might remind us why civilisation might be a good idea.

To celebrate my 50th birthday, my best friend and I embarked on our first European adventure, with Rome as our initial destination. Upon our arrival, we were immediately struck by the city’s incredible scale and beauty. “Everything is so grand!” became our catchphrase — and it truly was. Down every street and around every corner, something extraordinary awaited. In the open-air museum that is Rome, forget the car, put on your walking shoes, and get ready to log 15,000 steps/day discovering the city’s landmarks and hidden treasures.
Before experiencing Rome in person, we’d spent months laying out our itinerary, starting with a Google map where we pinpointed the places we wanted to visit and marked the center with a figurative X. When we arrived in Italy, what had appeared on the map as a web of gray lines connecting landmarks was transformed into living, breathing Roman arteries bursting with vibrant culture and sensory delights. Serendipitously, the focal point marked by an X landed us in the heart of Rome at the Palazzo Navona Hotel, situated next to the Piazza Navona. It proved to be the perfect launching point for our three-day exploration of the Eternal City.

I took a three-day trip to Italy on New Years. It was always my dream to visit the great Ancient Rome, so you can imagine how excited I was for this trip. Throughout my visit, I experienced some wonderful places, great food, and met new people. I want to share with you the rookie mistakes that I made, the things I did right, and ultimately what I learned from this experience. Here are some tips for navigating your way through the beautiful city of Rome.
Pack well (and right!!): Extra clothes, check, portable charger, check, type C, F, and L power outlet plugs, not check. Seriously, I spent the first half of my day there looking for electronic stores with the correct power outlet adapters. I made a rookie mistake, and hopefully, you will not have to.
Don’t pay extra. If anyone tries to convince you that you have to pay to get into the Vatican, I will assure you that you don’t. As soon as I arrived at the Vatican, I was unpleasantly approached by a man who apparently had only two tickets left to sell for the Vatican. Most might think that they “got lucky” and that they had just made it there in time before tickets were sold out, but that isn’t the case at all. Just keep your head up and walk right into the Vatican. It’s free. Thankfully, binge-watching travel videos on youtube helped me with that one.
Take lots of pictures. If you are traveling along, you can even ask tourists to take photos of you! As a solo traveler, I had plenty of time to soak in all the views and take my time appreciating all the sights and wonders. It is nice to take some pictures so you can reminisce later (who knows when you’ll be back). If you want to take some pictures of yourself, ask tourists if they’d be willing to take it for you, you’d be surprised how much photography talent there is in the crowd. If you see someone who could use a hand, offer to help them take their picture, they might offer to take yours back. Well, hey, it worked for me.
Plan well! I packed my day with wonderful sightseeing adventures and activities. It is crucial to check openings of the different places, especially on holidays. Unfortunately, I missed out on the great opportunity of seeing the Sistine Chapel because it was closed on the new year.
Throw a coin (or two) into the Trevi Garden. Legend has it that if you throw a coin over your head into the Trevi Fountain, chances are, you will return to Rome. If you throw two, you will return to Rome and fall in love, and three, you will return to Rome, fall in love, and get married there. I don’t know if this has been proven correct, but it can’t hurt to take your chances either way. Unluckily, I didn’t get to throw coins into the fountain, but have no doubt; I shall return.
Check out what Italy is known for, then make sure not to miss out. I enjoyed some delicious Italian Ice Cream, Pizza, and House Wine. The wine is incredibly affordable in Italy. While in the restaurant, don’t rush to receive the bill. It is customary in Italy to stick around and have a conversation after a nice meal.
Fly Ryanair! This one is a little bit controversial. If you asked me then if I would fly Ryanair again, I would have said that I would absolutely not. Looking back though, I realize how convenient it was to have a cheap flight from London to Rome. Just make sure you read exactly what you need to do when buying the ticket so they won’t charge you extra for late check-in or carry-on bags. If you don’t want to experience flight delays though, don’t fly with Ryanair. They might have cheaper flights, but that doesn’t mean they come without a cost.
I hope asome of these travelling tips helped you out! I know that I need to take some of my own advice on my next trip to Rome.
Edit: This blog is a repost from 3 years ago when I first visited Rome. Hope you enjoy!

For those unfamiliar with the Total war franchise it is essentially the dream game for military-history nerds like myself. It allows you to play as various different factions during a set time period- whatever era that game has chosen to focus on. Your aim as that faction is to conquer the map and build your empire. Unlike other history strategy games like EU4 or the Civ games, you can fight battles in real time on campaign maps. This is really what set total war apart and is why I fell in love with the games at a young age.
Of the various different time-periods Creative Assembly (the UK-based game developer) has done over the years the Ancient-Roman/Greek games have always been of particular interest to me. The idea of testudos, phalanxes and war elephants appealed to me in a way that things that came before such as Stone/Bronze Age warfare and periods that came after like the Medieval era could never fully equate to.
Needing to relax in my free time, as I am currently preparing for my COMPTIA Security + exam, I decided to play Rome Total War 2. However, the vanilla version of the game is a bit too normal and to spice things up you really have to be playing the DEI mod. If you were to sum up the DEI mod in one word it would be immersion. Multitudes of carefully researched new units, game mechanics and options have been added to the game.
All I needed to do now was pick a faction. Having recently done a Roman run and given that I’ve been reading and watching videos on the Punic war I wanted to give the Carthaginian Empire a good go. My aim would be to do what Hanno, Hannibal and Hasdrubal couldn’t. Conquer Italy.
Like in real life, in 272 BC Carthage has a tricky start. As a maritime focused, trading empire, stretched across the western Mediterranean, you find yourself facing threats from multiple directions. Your Spanish holdings are open to attack from savage tribes across the Iberian Peninsula, desert tribes to your south are ready to strike when they sense you are at your weakest and your holdings on the Island of Sicily are also under threat from the Greek city-state of Syracuse. And this is of course all before you come to the main emerging threat to your empire…the Romans!!!
No mean feat to be able to deal with such an array of threats. But wait there’s more. To make matters worse and in-accordance with historical accuracy, your land forces leave a lot to be desired. Carthage, as is the way with many trading empires, relied heavily upon their wealth to get mercenaries to fight their battles for them and only had a small core of their citizens as soldiers. The mercenary-centric nature of your armies could not be more strongly contrasted with the state-funded and citizen-staffed legions of Rome. Yet, there are some slightly redeeming features such as having superb cavalry, like Numidian and Iberian horsemen, and an array of aggressive light infantry mercenaries, which you can get from Gaul and Iberia. Whereas Rome goes for standardisation, to play to your strengths you should rely on the variety of mercenaries you can choose from.
With this all in mind, I devised a clear strategy. I would focus, as Carthage did in real life following their defeats in the 1st Punic War, on expanding my already existing Spanish holdings. I wanted to be able farm their resources and set up mines in order to fill my coffers for my future war against Rome. In essence it was a race against time- could I add Spain to my Empire before Rome came south and attacked me? In order to fulfil this strategy, I would have to leave other fronts less defended and accepted that some territorial losses like in Sicily or Africa would occur as a consequence of focusing on Spain.
Things kicked off to a terrible start. Whilst recruiting armies in Nova Carthago (SE Spain) to begin my bloody conquest of the Iberian Peninusla, Syrcause decided to launch a surpise attack on my Sicilian cities. They swiftly took my cities and liberated them to a Greek vassal of theirs. This was all part of the plan… I expected this to happen I reassured myself.
All was not lost, however, for two reasons. Firstly, through the use of trade and diplomacy I was able to prevent the desert tribes from attacking me to the south and I had secured my eastern border by establishing friendly relations with the Ptolemies in Egypt. Also by implementing a policy of Divide et Impera (see what I did there) I was now picking off one Spanish tribe at a time. Even better Rome had become mired in an attritional war against Epirus and then subsequently wars against raiding Thracian and Illyrian tribes. Again all I needed was time, even if they won those wars I would be strong enough to handle Rome on my own…if I conquered Iberia.
However, whilst I was getting closer to completing this goal, with my various armies subduing and annexing one tribe after another- disaster struck again. One of the Carthaginian noble houses revolted against my rule (the Barcid Family) and launched a revolt in my western African possessions . This threatened to stall my Spanish foray grievously. Luckily through the extra funds I was now receiving, I raised extra armies to speed up my conquest of Spain and through the use of my Numidian vassals I was able to simultaneously conquer Iberia and stave off the threat from the fifth column.
I was therefore ready to invade Sicily and take back what had once been Carthaginian. The invasion was swift and decisive. The Greek field armies, weakened by their own failed invasions, were swept aside by my invasion force. The siege of Syracuse was tough and bloody and after a desperate sally attempt by the defending forces; the city eventually fell.
Rome, seeing that I had taken all of Sicily for myself, declared open war against me. I knew I had to act fast, raising another army in Carthage and bringing my last army in Spain over to Sicily I was ready to invade Italy proper itself. My forces were able to overcome the two Roman legions defending their southern most province, Consentia.
Following this, Rome attempted to field 3 legions against my main force, however with fresh reinforcements coming in from Carthage and Iberia, I was now able to threaten multiple cities on the Italian mainland. After a great battle near Beneventum, I had crushed the last significant Roman force on the Italian Peninsula. It was a brutal engagement, which was won by my Iberian cavalry delivering a rear charge to their infantry and shattering their centre. After I secured my foothold in Magna Graecia, I finally marched on Rome. Following a direct assault on their city walls, the garrison of Rome was overcome and the city fell into Carthaginian hands. Rome was a broken power all that was left was to mop up the remaining strongholds it held on Italy.
So what are my reflections on playing as Carthage? Tough to be sure, particularly with the mod I was using. Fun?- Definitely, the initial position Carthage finds itself in requires planning and strategic foresight from the player. Although there were certain things the game cannot accurately represent and a couple of things which were a bit unrealistic, playing as Carthage is certainly something I would recommend to any person considering checking out the DEI mod. It is probably not as fun as Rome, the mod is built around playing as Rome, but as my Carthaginian campaign shows, you can still have a whole lot of fun roleplaying an alt-historical scenario such as winning as Carthage during the Punic Wars. These what-if scenarios have always fascinated us amateur military historians because we get to relive the strategic decisions that generals went through and it is exciting in itself to see how a different military strategy could have enabled a losing side to win and changed the course of history.

The professor showed us a photo of an insect.
“What is that?” he asked us.
A cricket.
“What would you think if you saw it on your bed?”
Get it off my bed.
But would I think the same way if I grew up in another part of the world?
Crickets.
Stepping on a plane to Rome, I did not expect that a metaphorical cricket would be one of the most important things I took with me on the plane back. But, here we are.
I recently spent two weeks in Rome, Italy, taking an international business class through Marquette University’s summer study abroad program.
We spent much of our time learning about how to do business in a global market and how to understand cultural differences. We also toured businesses in Rome and saw how global companies operate. We spent time exploring Rome and of course, eating a lot of gelato.
I had never been abroad. I had never even taken a business class. But this program expanded my view of both in new ways.
They say when in Rome, do as the Romans do. When I was in Rome, I saw firsthand how we all do as our culture tells us to do. But I also learned how to bridge those divides.
I have taken international advertising and public relations classes so I had some knowledge about global business before I went. I knew about high context and low context cultures. I knew about the importance of a power index to some cultures. I thought I understood it — but being abroad changed my perception on culture.
We are all told to live by the golden rule: treat others as you want to be treated. This doesn’t apply in other cultures. Here’s why.
Professor Kevin MacGabhann from the Strasbourg Business School in France was the professor who pulled up a photo of a cricket. He eventually explained.
In America, we see crickets as pests.
In Thailand, crickets are a popular snack.
In China, crickets are pets.
We might find customs strange if we’re not used to them. But once we learn more, we can understand it.
Most people understand that cultures build bonds and also create differences among groups of people. We can then begin to understand those differences as we learn more.
Professor MacGabhann showed us that understanding is only the first step. We need to recognize these differences in ourselves. We might find it abnormal that people eat crickets, but they might find it abnormal that we kill them.
Cultural differences are two-sided; we need to recognize the differences in both directions.
After we recognize our own cultural differences, we can begin to adapt. This is the most crucial step. Treat others as they want to be treated.
Treat others as THEY want to be treated.
When we are among different cultures, we need to adapt to their culture. Without doing that, we will run into tension and problems. That does not mean we need to go out and buy a cricket to keep in our room or eat one with dinner. It means if we are in Thailand, China, or somewhere else, we shouldn’t step on a cricket.
And maybe you are already adapting — you can get a cricket lollipop in Waukesha or a grasshopper taco at Belair Cantina not too far from campus.
In the context I learned them, these points were geared toward international business relations. However, they do not stop there.
I think that this point is so important no matter where we are. There are different cultures within schools, neighborhoods, work environments. We need to understand, recognize, and adapt whether we are in the Marquette bubble or across the world in Rome.
We need to understand, recognize, and adapt whether we are in the Marquette bubble or across the world in Rome.
I know that now I am going to look at my everyday life differently. I will pay more attention to the cultures surrounding me and do my best to learn and adapt.
I want to travel abroad again. I want to find new cultures and learn about them and try to adapt to them. But I do not have to go far to do that. I will start where I am and hopefully that will lead me across borders again.
Because abroad or not, I want to remember to do as the Romans do. Treat them how they want to be treated.

The Vestal Virgins inhabited a unique space in Roman society. They were the most prominent women in Rome, heavily revered and with privileges no other woman was given. But they also lived with extreme duties and restrictions. Their most famous restriction is obvious from their title: every Vestal was unmarried and pledged to remain a virgin through her thirty-year term of service. And a Vestal who broke her oath of chastity was buried alive.
But how often was this extreme measure used? And when it was, what did it look like? I have been researching Vestals for a few years as I work on a historical fiction novel centered around one (coming soon, I hope), and I’ve had to get into the nitty gritty details. Here’s what we know about the ultimate punishment for Rome’s most sacred virgins.
Before we bury one alive, let’s make sure we know who the Vestals were.
People ignore Vesta, but she’s one of my favorite goddesses, and was one of the Romans’ favorites too. Her duty doesn’t sound like a big deal today — goddess of the hearth, the fireplace. Modern people tend to think, “why have a goddess for that?” But for the ancients, the fireplace wasn’t just something to get cozy by to drink hot chocolate. It was the source of fire for the house, meaning the light for their lamps and the heat that cooked their food. Without Vesta’s flame, a house was vulnerable and unlivable. Vesta made a house into a home.
Sure Vesta isn’t as splashy as some other deities — she’s a virgin goddess so she doesn’t have relationship drama, and she’s a guardian of the home so she doesn’t leave to have adventures. But to the ancients she was steadfast and ever-present, a goddess without whom life would have been impossible.
Vesta’s private role as protector and life giver to the household was reflected in her public worship. There was a shrine to Vesta in the Forum Romanum¹ tended by the Vestal Virgins, who kept her sacred flame burning. Just as a house must have a hearth to make it a home, Rome was not Rome if the eternal flame was not burning — the flame represented the safety of Rome, and the favor of the gods that allowed Rome to hold its vast conquered empire. It took 24-hour maintenance to keep the sacred flame from going out. The Vestals also prepared the sacred grain/salt mixture that was sprinkled on the head of every sacrificial animal, so in a real way, Roman religion would have been nothing without them.
This legal status of the Vestals was unlike any other woman’s in Rome. For the ancient Romans, one of the essential characteristics of a woman was male control: she belonged to either her father or her husband. Widows with no living father had to pass into the legal control of a living male relative.² Unfortunately, the notion of women belonging to men is not strange to us. But male control of women was much more deeply entrenched in the Roman legal code than it ever has been in ours, and freeing the Vestals from that control put them into a shadow category, a zone that was neither masculine nor feminine. They could make wills and testify in court, which other women could not because they weren’t considered autonomous. They were also sacrosanct — it was illegal for men to touch them — and bizarrely sacred — if a Vestal accidentally met a man on his way to execution, his life would be spared.
After their thirty years were up, Vestals could do as they wished. Many chose to marry (and apparently men really loved marrying former Vestals, which seems like a lot we could unpack but I’m choosing not to). But many chose to continue their legal limbo — if she married, the former Vestal rejoined Roman society as a wife, reentered male control in the household of her new husband. An unmarried former Vestal was still a woman apart, the only truly autonomous woman in ancient Rome.
In short, Vestals were separate from Roman society, even as they lived in the middle of it. They were separated legally, and they were separated from close contact. They were not Romans really, but something else… they were representatives of all Romans, and of Rome itself.

But I promised I’d tell you what happened when a Vestal Virgin was convicted of violating her oath of chastity. For a Vestal, having sex was a betrayal of her promise to Vesta, an act which would put the safety of Rome in jeopardy. The virginity of average Roman girls and women was controlled in similar (though not identical) ways as in many societies today, but that’s not really what was going on with the Vestals. A Vestal’s purity was supposed to be a requirement for the proper public worship of Vesta, and Vesta’s worship guaranteed the safety of Rome. So an “improper” Vestal would lead to a loss of favor with Vesta for all of Rome — big trouble.
The accusation of inchastity could come in a few forms. It might come from a man — from someone who had heard of an affair, or maybe (though less likely for reasons that will soon be obvious) from the man who’d had sex with her himself, in a moment of repentance.
But, since a Vestal having sex was supposed to be an affront to the gods, the accusation might also come in the form of prodigies. Prodigies were messages from the gods in the form of unexplainable and supernatural events — calves born with two heads, lightning striking prominent monuments, etc. Two examples that stick in my mind are a soldier’s shield falling from the sky and a fully intact human head being found in the ground when digging a foundation. Prodigies sent the Romans to their priests, who would interpret the message and tell the citizens what action the gods required from them.
Some prodigies were good, but many (perhaps even most) threatened doom unless the gods were appeased. And sometimes the omens pointed a finger at the Vestal Virgins, and one or more of them would be accused of violating their oaths without any earthly evidence.
After the accusation, a trial. This was not the same as the trial of a citizen: it was a religious trial with the Pontifex Maximus as judge and the Pontifical College as jury.³ The priests would vote to convict or acquit. If they convicted her, the Vestal would be executed.
The doomed Vestal was carried, gagged, through the streets in a litter that had its coverings fastened down with cords; she could be neither seen nor heard. Crowds followed the litter, but it was apparently a solemn and silent occasion. She was brought to a tomb buried under a ridge of earth near the Colline Gate, on the north side of the city. Paradoxically, the tomb of disgraced Vestals was the only tomb allowed to be inside the city walls.
The tomb was stocked with provisions: bread, water, milk, oil, a lamp, and a bed, as if the Vestal was expected to go on living inside. Her litter was unbound and she was led, heavily veiled, to the steps to her tomb. Then the Pontifex Maximus said a prayer, and all the pontifices would avert their eyes as the Vestal went down, to avoid witnessing the moment of shame.
The tomb was buried, and the Vestal was left to die down there, no grave marker to commemorate her improper death.
The Vestal’s lover would then be subjected to a public flogging. Whipping was a common punishment — the pain was part of the point, but it was more about the public shaming. These floggings could leave the man alive, or they could be carried to the point of his death. Or, if her lover saw all this coming, he might just flee into self-imposed exile.
It was common for upper-class men in Rome to escape into exile if they knew they were about to receive a punishment that would either a) permanently mar their reputation or b) kill them. Rome tolerated this sort of thing and made no effort to hunt down the fugitives — a man who saw a trial turning against him would often leave town at night and face no consequence other than his loss of status. In the eyes of the ancient nobility, that loss of status was punishment enough… but when you put it on a scale next to “buried alive,” yeah, not so much. It was very possible for a man to escape with his life if he were accused of sleeping with a Vestal, and very difficult for the Vestal herself to do the same.
medium.com
The live burial of a Vestal was, importantly, bloodless. The Romans didn’t kill the Vestal — they put her in a room with the essentials of life to sustain her, and she died without their intervention. (Yes, I am aware they buried her in there; this is ritual, not logic.) It also offered the convenient out that the goddess could, if she so chose, save her priestess and prove her innocence. (I’m not sure if this was something the ancient Romans thought or just a modern supposition.)
The burial can also be meaningfully thought of as a human sacrifice. The gods were upset, and the Romans were offering up one of their holiest priestesses to soothe them. Human sacrifice was unthinkable to the Romans of classical times, but many of their religious rituals had much older roots in prehistory. Meanings got twisted and lost. The Vestal Virgin might originally have been a scapegoat, which would explain why she was kept so carefully between categories: she was no one’s wife and no one’s daughter, so she had no family to demand retribution for her death.
This quality of being outside categorization, and thus available as a sacrifice, might also explain why the Vestals had to be virgins in the first place. In a society in which a woman’s identity was totally dependent on her relationships with men, the sacred virgin stood apart. When they worshipped Vesta, the Vestals acted for the entire city: they could not represent the daughters, wives, or mothers of Rome (as other priestesses did); they had to be blank slates, to represent all Rome. Virginity meant lack of connections.
In short, a properly chaste Vestal was Rome itself. For the Romans, her purity was the safety of Rome, and when she lost it — when she slipped out of her symbolic role and back into worldly society by coming under the sexual “control” of a man — she had to forfeit her life as a sort of sacrifice to appease the gods. This she did in a method devoid of the kind of violence that would have sullied her further.
The immurement of a Vestal was a very rare occurrence. We only know of a few instances in all of Roman history.
Most of the Vestals who went on trial in the historical record were acquitted, not executed. In early history, we get the story of two Vestals who miraculously saved themselves from accusations of wrongdoing. When Vesta’s flame went out (usually interpreted as a sign of Vestal wrongdoing), the Vestal Aemilia threw her sash on it and it miraculously roared back to life, saving her. And a Vestal named Tuccia in the 3rd century BCE cleared her name by carrying water across the city in a sieve without spilling a drop. Vestals, as holy women, were supposed to be able to work miracles. Continuing to work miracles proved the continuing favor of Vesta, meaning they must still be virgins. (How or if these magic tricks fit into the formalized trial structure, I’ll never know.)
In 114 BCE came a bizarre prodigy: the young daughter of a prominent Equestrian was struck by lightning while riding her horse, and was found dead with her tongue sticking out and her dress hiked to her waist. Officials interpreted this as a sign of a scandal between an Equestrian and a Vestal Virgin. (Obvious, right?)
Three Vestals were accused: they said that Aemilia (not to be confused with the earlier miracle-worker) had become corrupt herself and then led the other two, Marcia and Licinia, into vice with her. Aemilia was convicted by the Pontifical College and executed, but the other two were acquitted.
What followed was outrage. The Roman people were convinced that there was a conspiracy of priests covering up the widespread corruption of the Vestal Virgins, and that the other two Vestals were also guilty. So in 113, a Tribune held another trial for the other two Vestals, moving it out of the Pontifical College and into the traditional court system. This trial resulted in a guilty verdict, and Marcia and Licinia were also executed.⁴
Emperor Domitian executed four Vestal Virgins starting in 87 CE. This was part of a push toward cracking down on public morality: like many reformers before and after, Domitian believed that people’s morals weren’t what they used to be, and that he could bring back the good old ways by punishing people for acting wrong. (Yeesh.) Domitian was also notoriously hostile toward the senate,⁵ and since the Vestals were the daughters of senatorial houses, killing them was a way to show the nobility who was boss. Since the emperor was always Pontifex Maximus, Domitian ran the trials and had no trouble securing convictions.
The first three convicted Vestals were actually not buried alive. Domitian allowed them to choose their method of execution. Only for the last, the Chief Vestal Cornelia in 91, did he insist on the ancient punishment. Which makes for an interesting point: we don’t know if the Vestal executions I described earlier were by burial. As far as I can tell, Cornelia is the only verifiable instance we have of a Vestal being buried alive. We know that the Romans considered this the ancient, traditional punishment, but we don’t know of anyone else it happened to.
Cornelia used the big public spectacle of her immurement as a platform. She announced to the crowd before the descended the steps: “Caesar thinks me unchaste, me who performed the sacraments under which he won, he triumphed?” Because, of course, a successful Domitian meant the favor of Vesta; if the empire was doing well, then surely that meant Cornelia was actually innocent.
On her way down, Cornelia stumbled, and the soldier accompanying her put out a hand automatically to help her. But Cornelia kept her balance without him and shied away from his touch — a sign to those watching (according to Pliny the Younger who recorded the incident) that this Vestal was so chaste she would not even accept the sacrilege of a man’s touch on the way to her execution.
And that’s about it for historical examples. There are vague insinuations of other Vestal executions, and concrete details of many other trials that resulted in acquittals, but we only have that handful of confirmed Vestal deaths, only one of them definitely by live burial. So though this sensational and very public punishment cast a long shadow over the lives of thousands upon thousands of Vestals who would never experience it, actual instances were vanishingly rare.
Which leaves us with two possibilities:
I’m inclined toward option 1 — probably there were instances of option 2, but the Rome I know was sincere enough in its religious beliefs that I have a hard time believing they were all openly flaunting tradition but not writing about it. I also think that the Roman men who wrote the histories had a hard time believing in a group of women who are uninterested in sex, and felt it necessary to imply that there had to be something going on there (when really, the something was worshipping Vesta). But historically, of course, it’s unknowable.
The Vestals were women who lived outside Roman society even in its very heart. From them we can learn much about Roman religion and Roman womanhood — and we can glimpse the sinister reasons for the policing of their virginities. The Romans held the Vestals up high when they were shining examples of Rome’s piety, and struck them down as low as they could when they became evidence of Rome’s corruption. The Vestal Virgins may have been the six most important women in all of Rome.
¹We usually call it the Temple of Vesta, but a Roman temple had to be planned out by augury (which Vesta’s wasn’t) and traditionally contained a statue of the deity (which Vesta’s didn’t). It was also rather small.
²In actual practice, such widows were usually fairly independent. But the fact remains that there was a legal requirement that they be in a man’s control.
³The Vestals were part of the Pontifical College, so the Vestals who had not been accused would have voted on the guilt or innocence of their colleague. Roman juries did not have the same ideas around impartiality as ours — in fact, it was considered an advantage if members of the jury to know the accused well, since their opinion of their character had weight in the case!
⁴This was a big move, the imposition of the civil government into what was supposed to be a religious matter. The boundaries between state and religion were a lot more porous than they (ideally) are today, but still — it was an insult to the priests, whom the politicians accused of not being able to handle their duties.
⁵There’s a probably-untrue anecdote in Cassius Dio in which Domitian invited senators to dinner and had gravestones for each of them made to put in their seats.

January 2, 2022|Italy
Today was a quiet day. We said goodbye to granny’s apartment in Assisi and boarded the train to Rome, our final stop in Italy.
The train trip from Assisi to Rome is not nearly as picturesque as the trip from Florence to Assisi. Fewer vineyards, fewer olive groves, fewer castles, no snow-capped peaks in the distance. We did see a few notable sites, however. In particular, we passed by Trevi (the town, not the fountain) which is one of those classic medieval towns where the church is on the peak of a hill and the rest of the town seems to tumble down the hillside.
We also passed by some random towers and fortifications that don’t seem to be guarding anything more interesting than a parking lot and a smattering of houses these days.
As we approached Rome, the surroundings, unsurprisingly, got more industrial and grittier. We passed by nondescript apartment blocks and graffiti that could have been in almost any city in the world.
We arrived a Termini station and seemed to walk for a mile to get to the exit. Then we hopped into a cab which proceeded to gouge us unconscionably. I’m too irritated to go into detail but it…

TLDR; I describe only this first stop of a recent 2-week trip to Italy — partly because of the initial strong and quintessential impressions I formed in this my first-time trip to Italy, and partly because the other dozen or so cities I visited which the reader can probably guess mostly echoed and nuanced these impressions.
Disclaimer: this is not meant to be fully representative of what you should expect when travelling in Rome. In fact it is probably a quite biased series of observations privy to my own meanderings, but I must say these feel very genuine and idiosyncratic of the city. All photos are unedited originals, and no AI was employed in the writing of this article. So Italians, feel free to bawl me out in the comments!
I am not an untraveled citizen of the world — — I’ve lived and toured all over Russia and China for years, for example — yet there are hundreds of countries I’ve never been to. Italy, for example! I realize this may be the exception to the rule for most Americans who can afford to cross oceans for travel, as Europe is a ready destination, whether to enjoy a summer out of school or participate in an exchange program because the cultural and linguistic barriers are lower than for Asia or Africa, for example.
Yet, I did not take preparation for this trip lightly. As I had done in my previous travels, I prepared as much as I could for the language, as I feel it is best to try to speak the local tongue not only out of respect for the people but also to enrich your own experience. Before traveling to Russia and China, for example, I had become fluent in those languages by my tried and true method. But for those I had a few years to spend, whereas this time I had just a few weeks. After skimming a long treatise on Italian grammar, I decided it was hopeless to memorize all the rules. I figured I would be best served in this time frame getting the gist of pronunciation and some basic phrases: what seemed to work well was opening up Google Street View to random locations in Italy, trying to guess the meaning of any signs or writing (graffiti included!) and speaking into Google Translate to check my pronunciation. Sometimes I was way off, but this made it fun! I also got some ‘street smarts’ of what to expect in random city locations. (Later on I had fun actually doing this live when traveling through city streets:
)
More formally, I transcribed Youtube videos (with captions to check my work) to polish listening comprehension. This is so much better than the old days of transcribing radio, and there’s a semi-infinite supply of great captioned videos out there. It’s nice that the graph shows, umm, statistically detectable progress over time!
I was still, however, pathetically prepared for the language. Luckily it is a Romance Language and thus not too far from English and Spanish, of which I know a little, so I could in principle struggle by. BUT, most importantly, essentially everyone we met in Rome spoke English! And when English didn’t pass the bar, they spoke Chinese! No joke, there is a sizable Chinese population in Rome running hotels, restaurants, taxis, and small shops, and I could converse with them absolutely fine!
Now the reader can imagine the usual hassle of international travel culminating in a teleportation to another reality outside the Fiumicino Airport. It looked not too dissimilar from JFK, to be honest. A Chinese driver picked us up, and we grilled him on all the ins and outs of living in Italy what with driving, shopping, eating, avoiding pick-pockets, etc. (he in fact spoke absolutely no Italian despite living there 14 years … that just shows you how strong the Chinese community is there!).
And I now transition to a series of disconnected, but in my view very profound, observations during my travel in Rome. What you will not see is any canned, touristy photos of say, the Colosseum.
Ah well, you’ll forgive me that one.
Every city has history, but in Rome it stares you in the face at every street corner. I mean, you’re walking along the street minding your own business and then the Pantheon is just there in front of you!
And plenty of modern shops and restaurants surrounding it from which to enjoy the view! (NB: these are usually not the better, more authentic restaurants).
Now this one really gets me, I mean is it just improbable or does this kind of thing happen every day: I’m walking through the park next to the Roman Forum, in the baking sun with my sandals feeling very historic and all, on a wide, dusty dirt path that must be trodden daily by thousands of tourists, and look down to pick up a dirty penny. I’m joking to myself, naw, could it be? Rubbing off the dirt, it is indeed no ordinary penny: it looks ancient! Well after some Google Image search it looks quite possibly to be not thousands of years old, but at least 200–300 years (a Vatican copper Quattrino from 1745?). Could also be a forgery to dupe stupid tourists like me, but I’ve been shown plenty of forgeries in my travels and they generally look good, with letters clearly visible and such, whereas this one looks a little too worn and bent by thousands of people stepping on it to make the trick worth it (probably about $10 by my reckoning based on eBay offers for ones in much better condition). Not a treasure exactly, and in its current foot-abused state of negligible archeological value (else I would have, ahem, turned it in to the authorities) but to grasp history serendipitously, and why me? Why now? This just made my day!
There’s no way I can do justice to the sheer volume of Classical Art in Rome, so I won’t even try. The Capitoline Museum, Borghese, countless cathedrals, … you will be overwhelmed by it, eyes and soul beaten to pure submission so you can barely issue a yelp of protest at the beauty in which you’re drowning. I will only say that on my first day in Rome I waited 2 hours in line to get into the Vatican Museum, and I have absolutely no regrets. Seeing this was an absolute “Aha!” moment for me:
And sorry, no pictures of the Sistine Chapel (it’s forbidden) to which this mere hallway led — — when you emerge into it you simply gawk in awe upwards at Adam touching the hand of God and the surrounding universe of imagery and forget where you came from.
Hidden Gems
Walking through the streets of Rome is like no other city I’ve been in. I mean New York is fast and vibrant, San Francisco friendly and upbeat, but Rome surprises you in a very peaceful, contemplative way. Like casually looking to your right, you see an alleyway entrance to an apartment building, and there’s a classical statue at the end in a little garden. Very nice!
Now this building across the street is most interesting, and the guard looks rightly serious about his job:
My usual gripe on the shortage of public restrooms in modern cities applies, but if you’re thirsty there’s a very nice thing in Rome: public fountains!
It has admittedly been decades since I dared drink from a public water fountain in the U.S., where the stale metallic quality in e.g. Central Park is like from a gym locker, but the water out of those Roman fountains is definitely decent! (after observing many others drinking first, of course).
I have to say I was not impressed with many of my compatriots (surmised by their accents) along the way — — one family accused us of ‘cutting the line’ at the Colosseum, which was patently false, and quite publicly made a ridiculous holier-than-thou scene of it. At restaurants there was almost always a very loud table of Americans with the worst language I have heard outside a drunken frat party. And at the Pantheon one very American-looking woman marched right up to the guard well after closing time and demanded “I want to go in there!” If the patience of the Romans hasn’t caved in by now, it must only be due to the compensating dollars rolling in, but that makes me a bit ashamed.
All I will say is I had pizza every day and never got sick of it! And that was of course just 1% of what we enjoyed …

Rome is one of the world’s great cities to visit. Filled with antiquities, wonderful historic sites, lovely old neighborhoods and great restaurants, it’s also a fantastic walking city. The running scene has been improving. Yes, there are busy, traffic-choked roads, tangled lanes difficult to navigate, and the air quality can be poor in the summer — but there are great places to run within proximity to where most travelers stay. Highlights of Rome running include a nearly 9-mile “Rome Sights” tour, including some of the principal landmarks and historic sites (go early or on Sundays!). Running along the Tiber River can be a pleasure, especially since a bike path along part of it was put in a few years ago. Rome’s three largest parks - Borghese, Ada, and Pamphili are also terrific for running. And running on the historic Via Appia Antica and the Parco de Caffarella is one of the most unique runs in the world.
Running in Rome will undoubtedly incorporate some of its famous “seven hills” east of the Tiber, as well as Vatican Hill and Janiculum northwest of the river. In terms of public transport, there is are two metro lines, which go round rather than through the historic city. There’s an extensive bus system.
Rome’s weather is Mediterranean. Summers are hot and dry and can be uncomfortable for running. Spring and fall is almost perfect for running. Winters are mild to cool but rarely cold, with moderate rain. Snow and freezing temperatures are rare.
8.6 miles,with options. Start: near St. Peter’s Square or any point. MAP
This is an attempt to put together a tour of some of Rome’s principal sights. Best to do it early before the streets get crowded and to beat the heat. See this as a ‘city tour’, and take your time! The map starts at Ospedale Santo Spirito, right near St. Peter’s Square, or at any point convenient to where you’re staying. The route follows the outskirts of St. Peter’s and Vatican City (without going into it). Then, just off Via Crescenzio is Castel St. Angelo. Cross the Ponte Cavour, over to the Spanish Steps and the Piazza de Spagna. Then, over to the Trevi Fountain and the Piazza Venezia & Piazza St. Marco. Skirt the Capitoline and the Roman Forum by running along Via dei Fori Imperiali to do a tour of the Coloseum, and then through the Circus Maximus.
Shorter option: take a right out of the Circus Maximus and head over to the famous Ponte Palatino. Cross the bridge and return to St. Peter’s along the river path.,Longer option: takes you through the Trastevere area, near the Passeggiata del Gianicolo, and via Garibaldi back down to the river. Add on even more by going up to Villa Doria Pamphili park.
7 miles ONE-WAY. MAP Start: North: Stado Olimpico. South: Ponte Guglielmo Marconi
Running along the Tiber River in Rome is a great way to go for a run and see the city without dealing with traffic and intersections. Several years ago, the city completed a bike path that runs nearly 7 miles from near Olympic Stadium to Ponte Guglielmo Marconi.
The trail runs through the heart of the most visited sections of the city, but below the roads. It’s a great way to do a dedicated run or to use it as a link to other sites or routes. Note that the path can get flooded fairly easily, often leaving behind a muddy mess. The northern section of the path officially starts south of Olympic Stadium but we start the run at the stadium, since it’s a thrill to see it and do a lap around the track. The southern section concludes at the Ponte Guglielmo Marconi. It is also possible to run on the eastern section of the Tiber.
7 miles Out and Back. Start: Circus Maximus Metro Station. MAP
The Appian Way is one of the earliest and most strategic roads of the Roman Republic. Sections of it remain, and it makes for a one-of-a-kind run. Even the marathon in the 1960 Rome Olympics had a section on this road. On a map, it is called “Via Appia Antica”. The surface is the original stone slab, which can be a challenging surface after a time. However, there is a path alongside for much of the way to ease the run. It is possible to run about six miles south to the perimeter road. The road is generally quiet and is closed to cars on Sundays. Our route starts at the Circus Maximus metro station. A nice option is a loop around the Circus Maximus or use the river path. Viale delle Terme di Caracalla is a good option on the return.
A great option is to combine the Appia with the miles of paths in gorgeous Parco Della Caffarella, where you can combine a run with a visit to the Catacombs. The park is more rural and agricultural in nature, with dirt paths though gorgeous green fields. A very different feel than the busy center city or the more manicured Roman parks such as Villa Ada.
~3 miles. Start: Piazza del Popolo, or Spanish Steps/Porta Pinciana. MAPAdd-Ons: Villa Ada Park, or paths along Tiber River.
At 148 acres, this is the third largest park in Rome. It is centrally located and makes for a great run. It’s possible put together a run of about 3 miles along the paths of the Villa Borghese. Sites include the Villa Borghese Gallery, lovely gardens, Museum of Modern Art, boating lake, and Piazza Napoleone. The paths are wide and gravel, and fairly shaded. Due to its central location, Borghese can be accessed via the Piazza del Popolo or the Spanish Steps/Porta Pinciana, among other options. A nice add-on/combination run is Villa Ada, which is another large park in Rome, less than 2 miles away. Use Via Salaria or Viale Romania. Guided walking tour here.
3 miles of paths. Start: Piazza Bligny. Easily accessed via bus. MAP
At 450 acres, this is Rome’s second largest park. It is more wooded and less finely manicured than Borghese or Pamphili. A private area is under control of the Egyptian embassy. The park has an artificial lake, a public swimming pool, and one can rent canoes, bikes, or horses. In summer there’s the Rome Meets the World Music Festival and numerous other outdoor concerts. For running, there are numerous paths throughout the park, including the perimeter of the fort, totaling ~3 miles. For a longer run, combine with Villa Borghese Park, taking Via Salaria, Via Panama, or Villa Romania to Via Giaocchino Rossini.
~10k of trails in the park. Start: in park,or accessible from St. Peter’s Square or Trastevere area.
Rome’s largest park, Villa Doria Pamphili, contains a stunning, mid- 17th century palace surrounded by garden mazes, jogging trails, fabulous fountains, a superb grotto, and pine lined views of Rome from atop the Janiculum hill. Note that there are not maps inside the park. Your best bet is to run the perimeter paths, which add up to ~10k. There are bathrooms and water fountains near the park entrances.
Good running options to/from the park: From Ponte Sisto, Via Garibaldi, passing through the Trastevere neighborhood and by important landmarks such as the Piazza de Santa Maria, Basilica di Santa Maria, the floodlit Fontana dell’Acqua Paola, and the Garibaldi statue. Mix it up by going through the Passeggiata del Gianicolo monument with the cannon that goes off at noon, or the switchback road, Passeggiata del Gianicolo. This makes for a ~2.5 mile loop, to and from the park.
2–3 miles within site. 2 miles to sea and then along water for 1–2 miles.
Ostia Antica was the harbor city of ancient Rome. It is now a well-preserved archaeological site, about about 18 miles northeast of the city and 2 miles from the Mediterranean. It is a popular tourist destination due to its ancient buildings, frescoes, and mosaics. It’s also easily reachable from Rome via a 1/2 hour train ride and is only a few km from the airport. Ostia Antica makes for a good running option along its ancient roads. The stone surface is similar to the Appian Way, although there is grass/dirt on the side as well. It is about 1.2 miles from one end to the other in the Ostia Antica site (admission required). There are numerous add-on options. There are lovely farm fields on either side of the Antica site. Or, run to the sea, about 2 miles, and then along the water, where there is a separated bike path from Faber Beach to the port, and then a nice jaunt out to the harbor.
Like any major European city frequented by tourists, there is a huge choice of places to stay. Pretty much anywhere you stay in the most visited parts of Rome will provide access to some of the runs in this guide. A few recommendations, for runners.
There are not as many specialty running stores in Rome as in other cities of its size. Each of the major running companies — Adidas, New Balance, Puma, and Nike has a store neat the Villa Borghese. A few of the specialty stores.
Footworks. Centrally located in San Giovanni area. Also close to Villa Ada and Parco Caffarella.
Born to Race. 2.5 miles south of Vila Doria Pamphili
LBM Sport. 1.5 miles north of the Via Appia
Rome has guided tours. And here.
AUR Runs Rome. The American University in Rome has an active club and meets regularly for group runs.
A.S.D. Roma Road Runners Club
Rome Marathon. April. Gorgeous race through the heart of some of Rome’s great sights.
Ostia Half Marathon. The varied course ROUTE is a fast one with some light up-and-down hill stretches. Starting near Palazzo dello Sport, the route runs in Rome, through the entire length of via Cristoforo Colombo then up and down the seafront, 280m each way, to the finish line at the round-about. (La Rotonda).
Rome Appia Run. April.

I don’t know many people who don’t love Italian food.
The pizza. The pasta. And the produce — just ask anyone who has visited an Italian market to describe what they saw there and watch them get all misty-eyed about bitter greens and parmesan. It’s a sight to see — both the markets and people’s reactions to them.
I recently took my fourth trip to Rome. This is a city that grabbed me by the stomach during my first visit in 2008 and has never let go.
It sounds like a cliché but Romans know how to eat and drink very well. It’s what keeps me coming back more than anything else. You can lead this horse to the Colosseum or the Vatican if you must, but I will only drink from the well of Roman food and drink culture.
30,000 steps a day around the city gave me ample time to reflect on how Rome just gets food and drink right. It’s a pleasure here, not a chore. It’s a way of life, not an inconvenience.
And we could learn a thing or two from that.
Start the day in a café, those quintessential third spaces Italy holds so dear.

Hey there, fellow history enthusiasts! Today, I want to take you on a journey through time and explore the forgotten history of one of the most legendary cities in the world – Rome. So grab a drink, sit back, and let's dive right in!
When you think of Rome, you probably envision grand architecture, gladiators, and legendary rulers like Julius Caesar. But did you know that Rome's history stretches far beyond the commonly known spectacular ruins? It's time to unveil some fascinating forgotten secrets!
To start, let's talk about the early beginnings of Rome. It all began as a small village on the banks of the Tiber River in the 8th century B.C. As I'm sure you can imagine, it's come a long way since then!
One of the most significant periods in Roman history was the establishment of the Roman Republic. It was a time of ambitious politicians, mighty generals, and the birth of true democracy. The Romans were all about the law and order, and they did it with style!
Speaking of style, let's not forget about the lesser-known side of Rome – the fashion! Romans were trendsetters of their time, known for their luxurious clothing, intricate jewelry, and even fashionable footwear.
Of course, we can't talk about Rome without mentioning the iconic Colosseum. This incredible structure served as a…

Intro: This is Citations Needed with Nima Shirazi and Adam Johnson.
Nima: Welcome to the Citations Needed live show Beg-a-Thon. Citations Needed is, of course, a podcast on the media, power, PR, and the history of bullshit. As I said, this is one of our periodic Beg-a-Thons, our virtual live show fundraisers. And we’re so glad that you are joining us tonight. Thank you, everyone. I am Nima Shirazi.
Adam: I’m Adam Johnson.
Nima: It’s great to have you all here with us. Of course, you can follow the show on Twitter and Bluesky @citationspod, Facebook Citations Needed, and become a supporter of the show if you’re not already, and this is a Beg-a-Thon, so we obviously would really like you to become a supporter, through Patreon.com/CitationsNeededPodcast. All your support through Patreon is so incredibly appreciated as we are 100% listener funded.
Adam: Yes, and if you become a supporter on Patreon, which, again, is ostensibly the purpose of this Beg-a-Thon, in addition to delightful conversation, edifying everyone, you get access to over 160 News Briefs, show notes and more fun stuff, special episodes, little things we do here and there, live shows, live chats, etc. But most importantly, you get to put your head on the pillow at night and go to sleep knowing that you supported our humble podcast.
Nima: That’s right. And tonight, on Citations Needed, we will be talking about how Elon Musk and his MAGA incel army have appropriated the cultural imagery and aesthetics of Ancient Rome, while obviously neither knowing or understanding anything about the ancient world beyond what maybe they’ve seen in Gladiator or 300.
Adam: To just sort of orient the audience, Trump World, and now increasingly, Elon Musk is effectively the co-vice president, are obsessed with evoking Roman symbols, iconography, to advance a fascist political agenda. I think it’s fair to use the F-word, fascist. We’re going to use that. I know some people dispute that, but I think I don’t really know what else to call it at this point. White nationalist, at the very least. And they present Rome and view Rome, either in meme format or explicitly, there’s even kind of a cottage industry of pseudo-intellectual scholars we can kind of get into as well who pander to these people, YouTubers, etc. They present it as a kind of the platonic ideal of a quote-unquote “Western civilization.” Everyone has their place. There’s a, you know, the kind of Nietzschean values of conquest and domination, how they view the world as being about, you know, rewarding the people with the most merit and the most honor, blah, blah, blah. And we covered this back in 2019 with today’s special guest. And there’s obviously been a lot of that, has gotten charged and heightened lately. And so we wanted to kind of bring her back also, because she has a wonderful book out that I have read. You should definitely read it too. It is excellent.
Nima: It is so good, and we’re going to be promoting it all night. So who are we talking about, Adam? We’re talking about our guest tonight, Dr. Sarah E. bond, Associate Professor in the Classics at the University of Iowa. Hey, Sarah, good to see you. Sarah joins us again after about five and a half years, she was on Episode 82, way back in July of 2019, in the before times, for our show, which was entitled “‘Western Civilization’ and White Supremacy: The Right-Wing Co-option of Antiquity.” So it is amazing to have you back. You, Sarah, are the author, as we said, of the new book Strike: Labor, Unions, and Resistance in the Roman Empire, which is out now from Yale University Press. I’m so excited to get to our conversation with you, Sarah.
But before we do that, we just want to note why we’re doing this tonight, this Beg-a-Thon, this kind of fundraiser that we do periodically. Citations Needed takes a team to make and it takes a ton of work to do each episode. Not many shows do the research that we do at the pace we do it, and since we started the show back in July of 2017, we’ve released well over 200 episodes, more than 160 News Briefs. We’ve welcomed more than 300 guests. We love doing this. We are grateful for each and every listener, every download, every like, every share, tens of thousands of you wonderful people listen to the show every week, and we cannot thank you enough for that. It is amazing. But only a tiny fraction of you actually support the show and our team through Patreon, which is the way that we’re able to keep doing this. And so that is why we are holding this Beg-a-Thon, as we call it, tonight.
Adam: So that was the good cop. I’m gonna do the bad cop. Listen, you mooches. No, I’m just kidding. I’m not gonna neg you, except to say that we are 100% user supported. We get no corporate sponsorships. We get no foundations. I’ll spare you the sanctimonious spiel, but you get the general idea. So if you do listen and you do like it, it actually is very, very helpful if you actually do support it, because, you know, there’s just not a lot of, of the people who listen, just not a high percentage do, and listen consistently. And yes, we have the data, and we’ve geolocated you. We know who you are.
Nima: [Laughs] That’s right. So tonight, we’re asking, if you are able, to please go to our Patreon page. We’ll put the link up there, but it’s very easy to find. It’s Patreon.com/CitationsNeededPodcast. Go help us out there. All right, enough of this garbage. Adam, let’s get to the show.
Adam: Yeah. Let’s get to the show itself. So tonight we are focusing on, again, we are using as a framing device the popularity of our new South African co-president Elon Musk and his minions and his incel army, with Roman iconography and alleged history as a gateway to talk about what is a far richer, more interesting vision of Rome that you’ve written, this excellent book you’ve written, which we’ll get into. So we’re going to start with that hook, and then kind of get into what you wrote about, which is obviously meant to, in some ways, kind of be a counter to that cheesy narrative, which I’m sure we can talk about. So we’re just going to give a little bit of background, Nima.
Nima: Yeah, sure.
Adam: If you want to sort of take over that part, because I know you had the unfortunate task of gathering that background information unfortunately.
Nima: So you know this idea of fascistic elements, neo-Nazis, in the US, namely their collective, now chief avatar, effective President of the United States, Elon Musk, the richest man in the world. They’ve been adopting and co-opting and misunderstanding the aesthetics of Ancient Rome, kind of as a rule, but as a distinct part of their fascistic political project. And one of the most prominent examples of this occurred after Elon Musk himself did a very clear Sieg Heil gesture three times during the inauguration of Donald Trump in January of 2025. Now Musk’s ally, Andrea Stroppa, who lives in Italy and claims to have an advisory role in some of Musk’s companies, posited that’s Musk Sieg Heil was was merely a Roman salute. Stroppa wrote in a now-deleted Tweet, quote, “Roman Empire is back, starting from Roman salute.”
Adam: Now, this was far from the first time that Musk had cited Rome to justify his reactionary ideology and paranoid xenophobia and deeply, deeply unfunny jokes. The guy’s constitutionally incapable of being funny, which is quite a feat. At least Trump’s funny, I guess. Now our guest, Dr. Bond, wrote for the arts news and analysis site Hyperallergic, we’re sorry, we’re going to quote you back at you. It’s one of the ultimate sins of podcasting, but we’re going to do it. Quote,
Musk has a long history of referencing the Roman Empire. His brand of technocratic despotism and its social media iconography has roots in the work of 20th-century European fascists, who were themselves fixated on Ancient Rome. He has long been obsessed with the late Roman Republic dictator Sulla and in December even changed his X avatar to “Kekius Maximus” — a Romanized version of Pepe the Frog dressed in military garb similar to that of Maximus in the film Gladiator (2000). Like Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, the billionaire has frequently expressed admiration for the Roman Empire, posting AI pictures of himself cosplaying as a Roman soldier…
God, that’s sad. You didn’t write that, that’s me, sorry.
…and cooking up theories about why Ancient Rome fell (answer: severe decline in birth rate). He thinks about it every day.
End quote. So let’s begin. I want to sort of bring in Sarah here.
Nima: Yeah, let’s do it.
Adam: We’ve set the table. Before we get into the questions about the actual book you wrote, forgive us, I want you to sort of comment on this piece, what you think superficially people find attractive. I know the elements are kind of obvious, but I want you to kind of dive into why you wrote this piece, why you think it’s important to engage as a historian of Rome with this seemingly popular current on the Nazi, or Nazi-adjacent Right.
Sarah E. Bond: Right, so the piece that I wrote for Hyperallergic, I wrote with Stephanie Wong, who is also a professor of history. She just graduated from Brown. And we write a lot together, because I think that our perspectives are very aligned, and we’re good at writing together, but we had been for years now, because we’ve been, gosh, we’ve been writing and collaborating for six years together, and so we decided that we were going to just collect all the things that he said since about 2020, about Ancient Rome, because I have just a gigantic digital folder of references to Ancient Rome that politicians have made over the years. And many of us who do a lot of reception history, which is just a fancy word for saying how things are repackaged and reused from the ancient world. We had been keeping track of it, and we had written an article together for MSNBC a few years, let’s see, a year and a half ago, on that meme about why people think about the Roman Empire.
And the person that Elon Musk thinks about the most seems to be Sulla, who was a dictator in the middle and early first century BCE. And Sulla eventually does give up power and is not assassinated. He eventually gives it up and retires and hands what’s left of the Republic over to Crassus and Cicero, I’m sorry, Crassus and Pompey, essentially, as the next consoles. But he’s obsessed with Sulla, and that really set off alarm bells in my head, because Sulla wiped out all of his political enemies by the hundreds. And this is something called the proscriptions, and Julius Caesar refuses to do the proscriptions when he becomes dictātor, or dictator, but it is picked back up again as a practice by Octavian Augustus. And so this idea that you can just wipe out all of your enemies and kill them and give people free rein to kill them is something that he’s idealizing, and it seems to be that he’s fixating a lot on. And especially with the purge of the federal government that’s been going on for the past, guys, can you believe that Trump has been president for a month, exactly, almost? It feels like it’s been five years.
Nima: It feels like it’s been 2,000 years.
Sarah E. Bond: It has been four weeks of nonstop layoffs and nonstop purging of the federal government. And I don’t think that’s the same in any way as killing people via the proscriptions, but I do think that Elon Musk likes to make people vulnerable to attack.
Adam: Yeah. Unless you fly a plane. Or rather fly on a plane, I should say.
Sarah E. Bond: I should just say with Elon Musk that we’re talking about aesthetics and idealizing. But I just want to point out something really huge here that was covered by Maya Pontone on Hyperallergic as well, with background from many researchers, myself included, is that Elon Musk has started to give money specifically to archeological projects and projects focused on the ancient world, and that there is a pipeline that is being created from the world of classics into, directly, the world of Elon Musk and this DOGE palace that he’s creating for himself, that we can’t just say that this is a fantasy that he’s playing out, that he gave over $2 million to the Vesuvius Challenge, which decoded a small amount of the papyri from Herculaneum and gave prize money to a young AI engineer named Luke Farritor. And Luke Farritor now works with DOGE and was one of the six engineers that originally went in with Musk a few weeks ago. So it’s not as though we can say, in the world of classics, Oh, we’re just, you know, he idealizes us, but we’re mutually exclusive. We’re in a bubble out here. What can we do about it? It’s like, No, we have people who are taking the money of Musk, the Vesuvius Challenge, as well as, there’s another called the AIRC in Rome, who has also taken money from Musk, and so he’s funding cultural heritage and AI as a way of accessing people that are involved with the ancient world. And you know, it matters who we take money from. It very much matters.
Adam: There’s a risk there, because, again, he did this. He’s obviously done this for years with STEM, where he throws so much money around that your favorite science channel will do these sycophantic reports on him. Science media will do sycophantic reports on him. They’ll get an interview with him and gush over him, even this is, like, sort of post-overt Nazi stuff. And so, yeah, I mean, when you have, again, $400 billion in debt worth, obviously, it’s not totally liquid, but it’s, you know, he could, he could take a loan against it anytime he wants. And, you know, controlling the past is, is because not to be too sort of, you know, I don’t want to be too overly precious–
Nima: You can rage against the machine. It’s okay.
Adam: Well. I mean, you know, He who controls the present controls the past. He who controls the past controls the future. I do think it matters, because then we’re going to be curated. It’s going to be curated, presented in a way that flatters his ideological dispositions.
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, and we’re already seeing that. We have Trump firing the archivist of the United States after she had already deleted and moved around parts of an exhibit that was within the National Archives. And he still fired her. But she had gone in and edited parts of history that were negative, right? And so the presentation of history and the people that are in control of it is what he wants access to, and he wants good press for sure, and he’s trying to buy himself a connection to antiquity in order to conjure legitimacy that we’ve already seen. This is the same MO that Mussolini took to legitimize his power and his rise within fascist Italy.
Adam: He’s basically–
Sarah E. Bond: All you have to do, yeah, you just rebuild the Ara Pacis, right? Rebuild the Res Gestae Divi Augusti, which is exactly what Mussolini does, is invest so many thousands and millions of dollars into the rebuilding of the Roman Forum and the rebuilding of the Roman senate house. This is a playbook we’ve already seen before, because he has no legitimate status within the federal government. So he’s clinging to what he perceives as the only legitimacy that he cares about, which is power from the ancient world.
Nima: Talking about preserving the past and also, you know, as we’re going to get into kind of who is allowed to control our understanding of the past. And we’re going to get into this, this idea of, you know, whether from imperial historians kind of empowered and sponsored to tell the official history of Rome, to this kind of idea of history from below, which you tell through your work, Sarah. I’d love to kind of discuss the overall thesis of your book, which really shows how class conflict and the organized withholding of labor was a consistent feature of Roman life, as were slave revolts, military strikes, other forms of resistance, much of which has been erased or at least reduced to individual stories of heroism in kind of broader ancient, historical retellings, and certainly in the popular mind. How those who don’t study this so closely kind of understand the ancient world, and then certainly Ancient Rome. So what compelled you to write this new book Strike, and what broad image of Rome, both in our pop culture and in kind of more historical consensus, were you attempting to illuminate and edify for us?
Sarah E. Bond: I was going back and re-reading an economic history of Rome from a guy named Tenney Frank, and he was a racist from the turn of the 20th century, like into the 20th century. And, I think it’s 1920, he writes an economic history of Rome, and he thinks that strikes cannot happen because of the number of enslaved people within the Roman Empire. And we do know that within the Italic peninsula, for instance, up to 25% of the population, especially during the the period of the High Roman Empire, so the first two centuries CE, have a large number of enslaved people. And even prior to that, there was a large number. And so he thought that because there were enslaved people, there could never be strikes, because every time you would have artisans going on strike, why wouldn’t you just replace them with other enslaved persons? And that really discounted the professionalization of enslaved people as potters, as weavers, as textile workers, as carpenters, as tavern workers and owners. And his belief that there weren’t strikes kind of infuriated me, and led me to read more about what people thought about strikes, about withholding labor, and what it might have been called in the ancient world.
And it was surprising to me that there just had been so little written on collective action and the withholding of labor in the ancient world, because many people, both Marxists and non-Marxists, had thought that there really weren’t a lot of instances of it. And so in the 19th century, Marx and Engels had believed that the first strikes ever had been the plebeians during what we call the Struggle of the Orders, which really starts in 495 BCE. And if we’re trying to place that, that’s about 15 years after the start of the Roman Republic. So 509, the Roman Republic starts. The last king of Rome is ousted, and we have the start of something we call the res publica, or the republic. And a few years after that, we have the plebeians and the patricians fighting against each other because the patricians are extremely wealthy and they have a lot of power, but also they have a lot of both soft and hard power, in that they monopolize all the magistracies, the consulship, the pontifical colleges, all of the major magistracies, the patricians are, are really dominating.
And so I looked at the Struggle of the Orders, but thought to myself, I think there has to be many more instances of this happening. And so starting to look through things that really didn’t make it into the traditional literary historical record, like papyri and inscriptions, really was the access point to find out that, especially in the Greek world, and going all the way back to the Egyptian world, this had been happening for many thousands of years. And so I started tracing backwards and forwards and finding that there were a lot more instances, because a strike by any other name is still a strike. And so even though the word is not coined until the 18th century in England, because it’s referring to the striking of the top sails of merchant ships in the 18th century, even though that word does not exist in Ancient Rome, that you still have the withholding of labor and the boycotting of certain assigned things like the military levy through calling it a secessio, where we get, for instance, the word secession from. But then when you look in the Greek papyri, they’re calling it an anachoresis, which just means a withdrawal. And for many hundreds and thousands of years, we’ve had workers, especially in Egypt, refusing to work unless they were given emmer and wheat and the right amount of staples to keep working. Sometimes they would just go sit in the back of a temple.
And so for me, it was saying modern people think that strikes are a development of the progressive modern Western civilization post-Industrial Revolution, and as is my wont, I usually like to say to most things, Well, that sounds like bullshit, that that we have created this idea of progressive structure to get to the period that we are now, even though it does not feel that we are in a progressive moment in the least, and to try and unpack why we think that unions and strikes and labor withdrawals, that all of these things are a much more modern development in order to really make us feel a little bit more successful as individuals. And I think we just have to give more credit to the Romans.
Nima: Yeah, I love the idea that, like, a strike by any other name is still a strike that, even if they don’t use that term, because, you know, you actually start your book by talking about how the term was coined, the striking of sails in a British port. But then going back to Deir el-Medina, the strike in Egypt, and then kind of tracing that up through history is just, I think, really, really fascinating to see how, in a world that is built on the on the backs of laborers, the power that is held through withholding labor, has been recognized, not just, you know, since the Industrial Revolution, but you know, for thousands and thousands of years.
Adam: On some level, the idea that people around the world would withhold labor is, it does seem sort of self-evidently obvious, because what other leverage do you have as a laborer? And 99% of humans throughout history have been laborers, typically exploited in any kind of semi-developed sense that would be exploited by some rich asshole who lived on the hill. It doesn’t. It’s not a huge leap to say that this is a kind of universal, that there’s an evolutionary convergence to land on some form of strike, right? And what you argue is that while that is true, there was also more sophisticated antecedents that made these more coordinated, more and more sophisticated than we maybe thought.
And one of the things we talk about is these associations, which were both kind of, which were not these kind of perfect Marxist organizations, in the sense that they were oftentimes kind of business trade groups. They didn’t fit along these kind of perfectly, you know, Maoist lines, but in many ways they what you do argue is that they could be instrumentalized to carry out something we would recognize as a labor strike, and that because of the way history is written, you specifically talk about Levy and others, because of the inherently elite nature of reading and writing and how history is created, the first draft, second draft, third draft, that those stories get flattened or obscured.
And you even have this great section, I won’t read it back to you, because I’d like you to talk about it, about the ways in which mob violence is flattened. When you say that oftentimes, as a class dimension, that is fairly obvious, but in the history books, it’s kind of written off as just mob violence. And you even draw some parallels to current examples, when mass unrest is sort of stripped of its ideology, which I thought was a really fascinating, really interesting part of the book. Can you talk about the ways in which–
Nima: Cicero was just doing what the New York Times does now.
Adam: Well, yeah, by the way, I found out he did, The the shrimp store called and they’re running out of you, The jerk store called, where he would, I didn’t realize this until I read Mary Beard’s book, that he would write what he said on the Senate floor later on, which seems like cheating. And then people presented it as like, He’s this great orator, and it’s like, You just got to go back and rewrite it. Anyway. Talk, if you could, about the these associations, how they provided the kind of framework to make a more sophisticated form of labor unrest, and if you could also talk about the ways in which historians, for obvious reasons, who were wealthy or patrician or what have you, decided to kind of say, Oh, that was just mindless, ideology-free violence.
Sarah E. Bond: I think when we create homogenous groups, when we call everybody a mob, that’s already a pejorative, it’s already casting them into negative rhetoric. And the Romans are no different. They like to use very large, amalgamous nouns, a turba, a multitudo, that is to just say, a gigantic negative word for a crowd, right? And when you just say crowd, you aren’t allowing for organization, you aren’t allowing for hierarchy, you aren’t allowing for structure. And although we don’t get a ton of anatomies of crowds from the ancient world, we can see, especially in the late Republic, that a lot of groups that are coming together, what we call collegia, and that’s where we get the modern word college from. A collegium, in the singular, is just a group of people. In Roman law, you have to be three or more people to be considered a collegium. And we have about 3,200 inscriptions in papyri that give reference to these various groups that really grow in number in the early Hellenistic period forward.
So from the death of Alexander the Great forward, people increasingly are creating groups for various reasons. So you could have a group that is focused on Dionysus, because who doesn’t want to get together and drink some wine and have a nice bacchanalia? But you could also form a group, if you were merchants or trades people living on the island of Delos, and you’re human traffickers, and you need to have a workflow, essentially, that moves people throughout the Mediterranean. You can move bread through it, in terms of wheat and flour, you may need to have a supply chain to give you precious jewels, pepper, cinnamon, lots of things that you might want to trade, or you might just be a carpenter and want to have other carpenters that you work with.
And so these collegia are proliferating, especially into the period of the Republic. Many of them don’t have enough money to meet in a proper schola, which is a clubhouse. And so lots of them do what many confraternities have always done, and that is meet in a public house, called a pub. And so you go to a tavern, the tavern keeper allows you to sit there and to congregate. And when we try and understand the movements within the late Republic, one of the things that I think is important to see is that these groups are coming together extremely quickly, in a very organized manner, in order to hear public speeches called contiones. And so my question is, Okay, we have rhetoricians like Cicero, who’s calling them just a gigantic mob, but in reality, he’s giving us clues that say that they’re starting in a specific sector that artisans are known to live within, and that the tavern keepers are involved in it. And to me, trying to reconstruct the underlying structure is very important, because a lot of that gets erased in the name of marginalizing them. And marginalizing vocabulary is something that we’ve seen, especially since 2020. When you marginalize a crowd, we saw this even with Occupy Wall Street as well, is that, yes, Occupy Wall Street actually was quite organized, even though, yes, they were very against hierarchy and a lot of the traditional leadership structures, but we really see that it’s elite people who tend to call crowds mobs.
So whether it’s Black Lives Matter, whether it’s any other social movement, it deprives them and really robs them of their peaceful protest and of their organization. And I think that this is something that always has happened, is that really wealthy people, if you want to completely marginalize a movement, you just simply call them a mob. And that just is an unjust way to label many groups, not all groups, but I think a lot of groups have been robbed of their legitimacy by being called a mob, because immediately you think of violence and criminality and also anti-patriotism, and that’s something that with unions, for instance, if we go back to Garfield, President Garfield, not the cat. I mean, I like the cat, too.
Adam: No relation.
Sarah E. Bond: No, no relation. President Garfield, he hated unions, and he thought they were unpatriotic, and he thought of them as just individuals who incited mob violence. And so it’s not hard to trace and to track down the ways in which we marginalize groups of people, individually, but also groups that are coming together in order to fight for their rights.
Nima: But it’s not just in rhetoric, right, Sarah? I mean, because also then the discourse and the language and the denigration also turns into policy or legislation, and we see that now, you know, with anti-protest legislation across the country, whether that is, you know, from campus protests against genocide in Palestine or, you know, long before, anti-assembly legislation. But you also talked about this in your book Strike, about how the elites and the wealthy call associations or call, you know, regular people getting together, not only a mob, but then they kind of legislate against it. Talk about where that came from, and some of the parallels there.
Sarah E. Bond: I think we’re all thinking about anti-assembly legislation, especially since October 7, and thinking about groups coming together and protesting against the treatment of Palestinians especially. I visited the groups that were on the quad at the University of Chicago. We had a very small group at the University of Iowa, for instance, and many campuses across the country were. Pushing them off of public property. Now, the University of Chicago is a private school. That’s a little bit different, but we even saw this at public schools that people were getting arrested, that they were not allowed to assemble, even when they were just peaceably in their tents and just sitting there.
So I think that we’ve been thinking about freedom of assembly and whether that is a civil right and to what extent it should be protected. And when we go back to the ancient world, we see that freedom of assembly was something that very wealthy elite people like senators and the emperor were very, very anxious about. And it’s not something that is new, that, especially for instance, Julius Caesar and Octavian moved to make legislation very soon into their periods of rule that say, Okay, well, you know, collegia, maybe they can, they can meet at certain times, but predominantly we’re going to have them disband unless they’re the oldest collegia that have ever been established, and if they have a public utility, right?
And this idea of the civic good that a collegium has to serve the civic good, it’s tying into this idea of patriotism, again, is that freedom of assembly is only extended if it is for the good of the res publica, but when you get into the Empire, the res publica does not really exist anymore. It’s a false reconstruction that Augustus has made, right? He calls it the reconstruction of the res publica, but come on, it’s an empire. It is the empire that he is building, and he is the imperator. And so what he’s really saying when he disbands collegia and when he begins to threaten freedom of assembly more and more, is that I don’t want myself threatened by this, and I don’t want any public discord that might turn into resistance against me.
And the smothering of resistance before it can really ever get a lot of steam is just something that is quite common within the Roman Empire. People think that they’re, Oh, you know, the Roman Empire was so good to live in that there was just no resistance, right? Like after Spartacus, we have, Oh, very little, except for maybe the Jewish Wars that are in Judea. And that’s just not true, because everyday resistance, the act of forming a union, the act of engaging in a labor strike, right, the act of pushing against this revoking of freedom of assembly, everyday resistance, is just as important as these gigantic rebellions. They don’t just formulate out of nothing. And so I think that freedom of assembly has always been revoked and questioned and placed as something unpatriotic, because those in power have always known that when people get together, they have more power collectively than they do apart, and that’s why the motto of the United States is E Pluribus Unum, one out of many. And right now, we’re seeing a shift to just the unum part, but not really the people as much a part of it. So that’s something that is really scary to see Trump tweet out, “LONG LIVE THE KING!” It was something that gave me chills, because I immediately thought of the late Roman Republic.
Adam: So I want to sort of back up here a little bit and sort of maybe circle back with what we talked about with your book, with the sort of more topical themes about the rightwing fascination with Rome. And it’s superficial, albeit superficial, which is, I mean, look. Rome as a sort of idea is the way we sort of perceive the West, right? You know, it wasn’t till the late ’90s that to graduate from Oxford, you had to know Latin. It is, it is the way in which academics and intellectuals and scientists talk to each other, up until, again, whatever, the 1800s. Rome, obviously, is kind of what we what, what is viewed as, as Europe, as a sort of, for want of a better term, white civilization, despite the fact that it, of course, wasn’t one in any meaningful sense. But that’s certainly how it’s been idealized as it’s gone through its various white supremacist historical laundromats throughout the decades. And so it kind of makes sense why people who are kind of adrift, or don’t really have any firm, who aren’t very firmly committed into any kind of ideology, would be drawn to it because of its proximity to, it’s sort of a more politically correct form of white nationalist sort of mythmaking.
And so, in some sense, does it make sense why a sort of mediocre, you know, internet-addled dope like Musk would would, again, superficially be into it. He sort of praised Mike Duncan’s podcast, much to Mike Duncan’s chagrin. It all kind of makes sense, because it is this sort of idealized, white, sort of heroic version of themselves and in a weird way, I know I mentioned her book before, but Mary beard’s book SPQR, at the very end, she has this line that’s clearly in dialogue with that, where she says, I get asked a lot, you know, basically been working on this book for 50 years, I get asked a lot, What do we have to learn from modern society in Rome? And I’m paraphrasing here, forgive me if I’m misrepresenting this. But she kind of says, Basically nothing. And I don’t think she meant that, like in a non-, in a sort of anti-intellectual way. I think she was, it appeared to be in the context it was written to be responding to these people constantly saying we’re at the end of the Roman Empire, because it’s so cliche, right? Isaac Newton said it. I mean, every 10 years we’re, you know, we’re in the end. Everyone likes to talk about the fall of the Roman Empire, because what are you criticizing? Homophobia, right? You sort of, you’re trafficking the idea of, we’re becoming effeminate, we’re becoming weak. Blah, blah, blah, the meme Strong Men Create Good Times, Good Times Create Weak Men.
Sarah E. Bond: A lot of immigration. They really like to harp on immigration.
Nima: That’s right. The barbarians are coming.
Sarah E. Bond: Right. The barbarians at the gates. Yes.
Adam: So if you could, if you would comment a bit about or rather, it’s a little bit open-ended, but I want you to talk about why you think that the mythology, the white supremacist mythology of Rome, appears to be increasing, but has kind of survived and what you think, to what extent do you feel like some, you know, I don’t want you to name names necessarily, but what extent pop history movies have really contributed to that, where they do have this very one-note kind of vision of what, not to sort of blame them for it necessarily, one-note vision of Rome?
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, I did review Gladiator, too. So we just, I mean, I reviewed it for Hyperallergic and I think a lot of the misconceptions about Rome are very entertaining. That when it goes on film, who doesn’t like watching the first Gladiator in the year 2000? And all of the things that are being picked up on and received, right as it’s being filmed at the end of the Clinton administration, is talking about, We can bring Rome back. We can bring the Republic back. Now that’s absolute bullshit, because Marcus Aurelius, in no way ever wants to bring back the Republic. There is no hint of evidence. He had always set Commodus as being the one that was going to be his successor. But this idea that the Republic could come back, that was a romantic idea of the year 2000 that then resurfaces this year with the latest Gladiator, 25 years later, really, 24 years later, coming to the surface, this idea that the Republic could come back. So I think that there are some people who really want to see a genuine resurfacing of proper governance, or some sort of governance that people influence in some way. And so I’m not saying that Gladiator II is completely innocuous, because there are a lot of things wrong with that movie, but they are entertaining. Whether there were sharks in the amphitheater or not, and there were not sharks in the amphitheater, sorry.
Adam: Aw, boo. Sarah! Let me live the lie.
Sarah E. Bond: You could fill the Colosseum with water. It was watertight. So that’s true, you can have a sea battle in the Colosseum, but there were not sharks.
Adam: They got a little greedy with the sharks. They got a little greedy.
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, the CGI was just too far. So there are innocuous things, I think, like sharks in the Colosseum, that I’m really fine with. It’s just that this love affair with the fall of Rome is this idea that, especially conservatives, but we also have liberals who have written horrendously facile op-eds about the fall of Rome as well, that they can be the prognosticators using history. So they’re not only making themselves look extremely cerebral and extremely knowledgeable about quote-unquote, “Western Civ,” they’re also telling the future, and that gives them a level of power within the public sphere, and what they perceive of as the intellectual community, that gives them some sort of currency that they’ve read Gibbon. Well, who hasn’t read Gibbon? There are a lot of people that have read Gibbon. He published a two-volume set in 1776, guys, okay? There are no spoilers here. Everybody kind of knows what Gibbon has said.
But Gibbon is also speaking about the late 18th century. Everybody who is writing history, including myself, is thinking about the time period that they are living in. And I just think that, going back to this idea of the fall of Rome, is not only regurgitating and recycling Gibbon, which it clearly is, but it’s trying to send out a message that I am the truth teller, so please put your trust in me, and that’s essentially what op-eds are supposed to do anyways, right? Like I’m an opinion writer, I have a thousand words, I’m going to sway you that what I’m telling you is significant. It’s just that they get the history so wrong, especially, I would say when it comes to talking about religion and talking about, also, immigration, and talking about what really brought down different component parts of Rome, because Rome doesn’t fall monolithically together as one. That we have fracturing, that we have going in different directions, that many areas like North Africa stay extremely strong up to the Vandal invasion and things like this. So I mean, it’s just this idea that they can read the tea leaves through their historical abilities. And it’s just very wrong.
Adam: Yeah, and I’m going to read here from the Nixon tapes. He was obsessed with this idea. He ranted about it a lot. Quote,
You ever see what happened, you know what happened to the Greeks? Homosexuality destroyed them. Aristotle was a homo, we all know that. So was Socrates… Do you know what happened to the Romans? The last six Roman emperors were fags.
He concludes by saying,
You see, homosexuality, dope, immorality in general, these are the enemies of strong societies. That’s why the communists and the left-wingers are pushing the stuff: they’re trying to destroy us.
To be fair, I do do that. He’s got me there. But this is, again, this is so cliche. This has been done a billion times. The idea that, so much of the Roman, and you know, people would say, generally, corruption is what they’re really kind of referencing. But really it’s this idea of, again, Musk is obsessed with this idea of feminization. Again, he’s into weird kind of Silicon Valley natalist cults. He’s apparently doing some kind of panspermia experiment to half of California right now. I guess he’s on his 13th kid. And so it’s like this, this idea of, again, immigration, lack of white fertility, homosexuality, is like they all, they want to see it in Rome in a way that, of course, is not there, but that, of course, doesn’t really matter.
Nima: Well, I think what’s interesting also is, is, you know, the obsession with the kind of emperor or or even patrician class from some of the wealthiest people on the planet kind of makes sense, right? There’s a corollary there. It’s not just Musk. Also Mark Zuckerberg names his kids after, you know, Roman emperors. There’s a whole thing, weird thing going on. But, Sarah, I’d love for you to talk about how, how it’s not just, you know, the wealthy that kind of see themselves as part of that tradition, and kind of wanting to bring that back, that kind of makes sense, right? Like the people in charge want to be like the people in charge, but it’s for the workers and the people who glom on to this aesthetic as well, who all see themselves as warriors, not as other kinds of workers, right? I mean, we’re seeing farmers in the United States right now gutted by the cuts that have just been made to USAID. You know, hit hardest. You know, American farmers. That is not the kind of imagination that people storming the Capitol, or people excited about, you know, stanning for Musk on Twitter, like, they’re not seeing themselves as the people. They’re seeing themselves as these kind of like delayed warriors with the, you know, with the helmets and the crest and the Gladius by their side. Like, you know, where do you think that kind of comes from and how, how is that shaped by how we understand history, which I think your book starts to really unpack, like, who the people really are, and how we hear their stories, the kind of people’s history, not only of Rome, but of ourselves.
Sarah E. Bond: I think the idea of the American Dream is that we can always pull ourselves up from our bootstraps and be Musk, I mean, to be the richest man in the world. A lot of people imagine that they are capable of that, and we know that a very small number of people are ever able to ascend from poverty into the very wealthy 1%. And Musk isn’t even somebody, I mean, he comes from a family of emerald mine owners in South Africa. Trump comes from money. These are all nepo babies, okay, but this idea of the American Dream is that if you work hard enough, you can ascend. But part of that also is this idea of masculinity that is inextricably linked to Roman soldiers. And so if we go back to January 6 and the storming of the Capitol, there were people with signs where Trump was dressed like Maximus. Maximus, again, is not a historical figure there. It’s not real. Russell Crowe is playing a fictional character. But they are imagining themselves to be the highest order of masculinity. And the visualization of that, the kind of allegory that we have assigned to masculinity is the Roman centurion. And so, you know, just yesterday, I was looking at the new picture of Odysseus that was released for Christopher Nolan’s new version of The Odyssey. I want to see it. I’m going to see it, right? But Matt Damon has a crested helmet on that is very much not exactly what would have been worn in the Trojan War, but it is a crested helmet that is kind of very much emblematic of later soldiers that that are fighting, because the Greek phalanx and Sparta, etc., also is a symbol of masculinity.
And so when you try and question those constructions, people get very upset, because especially white men, tend to idealize both Spartan soldiers and also Roman centurions and soldiers as their everyday lives, like, This is how I should go through life. And these are people that don’t quite realize that if they were transported back to the ancient world, the vast chances are that they would be an enslaved person or a farmer or perhaps an artisan or a potter that’s making ceramics, and many of those also fought as soldiers in the earlier period of The Republic, when we have citizen armies. Enslaved persons usually did not but they were incorporated into the military in other ways. But yeah, I really think that it’s, it’s tied up in aesthetics of masculinity.
And I love that Adam said earlier that this is history laundering instead of money laundering, because that’s just exactly what it is. All of the actual, real colors of history have bled out, right? They’ve faded. They’ve been laundered to death, and now it just doesn’t even look like it actually was. It is a meme, and that’s exactly how memetic things work, is just continue to be recycled until they don’t really resemble the past in any real way. So the book is, in large part, trying to bring back the voices of just regular enslaved peoples, freed people, that is to say people who are manumitted, which is also a large part of the population, and they may not seem as sexy as a centurion, but we have the ability to redefine what sexy is. And I think that merchants who form a collegium and go on strike or sexier to me than a centurion that is running into battle. But yeah, I think there’s many books that are incorporated into this and that have been written and will be written on the reception of Roman history and white supremacy, but I think it all comes down to this feeling that, that this is the ultimate, this is the epitome of what it means to be a man.
Nima: Right. I mean, it’s really interesting that you mentioned, you know, that Russell Crowe is, you know, just an actor. Maximus doesn’t, doesn’t really exist. And in your book, you note that actors actually may have been the first in Ancient Rome to form what could be deemed like a proto-union, right? So, like, again, who is the everyday person, who are the people that are really organizing? Who is afforded the protections? Is it the you know, emperors, or is it the artisans?
Adam: I don’t want to let you go without asking about the viral popularity from 2016, then 2019, then it was huge during COVID, of Marcus Aurelius meditations and like Stoicism as this kind of masculine ideal. Ryan Holiday is kind of a hack writer, wrote a book about it, has a podcast about it.
Sarah E. Bond: We call that Broicism, by the way.
Adam: Broicism, sorry, and this is, apparently, it was, it’s been all the rage, and there was a viral lecture on it that was very sort of rah-rah that went viral during COVID. Again, on some level, one can see I actually read it. It was beyond tedious. But I stuck it out. I definitely don’t meet the the platonic ideal of a Stoic. As those listening to the show may be aware, I sometimes complain. And so I want you, I want to ask a little bit about, again, the sort of cartoon version versus the kind of real version. And it mean, again, these book sales, these podcasts are popular, these TikToks are very popular. This is, this is legitimately popular, and this is the primary entry point into Roman history for a lot of people. So talk, if you could, about the rise of Broicism and how, I don’t know if you, if you engage with this with a lot of undergrads or whatever, and talk about where you see it happen.
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, I want to say, if you’re going to buy a translation of Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations, my professor, whose name is Gregory Hays, I believe, wrote the best translation. So if we’re going to give actual money to anybody for buying Stoicism, and please don’t do those Instagrams that are like Stoicism Every Day, I’m going to send Stoicism and witticisms to your inbox, which half the time they’re fake. They’re fake quotes from Seneca. They’re fake quotes from Cicero. They’re fake quotes from Marcus Aurelius, etc. In any case, translations, who you choose to translate your words are extremely important. So yes, pick your translator carefully, number one. Number two, I think that if we think about technocrats and why this philosophy is extremely alluring to them, we can think about the fact that when you are a Stoic, you have to be happy with your lot in life, and it really behooves technocrats to have coders, to have people that are working within their companies, have a philosophy where they come to work and they’re like, You know, Gosh, darn. I’m just happy to be here. I’m going to be the best coder that I could be, right? And when we read things like Epictetus, then we think, Oh, I will be the best enslaved person that I could possibly be. But let’s face it, when you write the Meditations as Marcus Aurelius, and you say, I’m happy with my lot in life, well, you fucking should be. You are the emperor! You are the emperor! And so Elon Musk adopting Stoicism, which he really is not a Stoic in any stretch of the imagination.
Adam: No, I don’t think Stoics would post 50 tweets a day. Yeah.
Sarah E. Bond: No, no, no. This is not a man that I associate with Stoicism. But many technocrats within the area of the Silicon Valley have begun to glom on to this idea, because it is an opiate of the masses, essentially, as a philosophy. If everybody actually adopted it, then you would have people who aren’t trying to buck the system, that they are not trying to rebel, that they are not trying to modify the system in any way. They are trying individually to work internally on being the best person that they can be, but to reinforce the social hierarchy that already exists. I mean, this is not about transforming the society. It’s about reinforcing the status quo. And right now, the amount of social inequality that we have very much benefits extremely wealthy people. These are just wealthy people that want to maintain their wealth to an even higher degree, and Stoicism is a philosophy that supports their thesis, which is, I am awesome and have a lot of money that I wish to keep. And so they’ve only adopted the philosophy post-thesis.
Nima: And everyone else needs to be cool with that, too.
Sarah E. Bond: Yeah, get with it! Come on, guys! This is part of the world that we live in, so just pacify yourself. Go forward and come to the office. Do not stay at home and do not work from home. We want you in an office. We want you doing the tasks that we are asking you to do. And please don’t question it, because questioning leads to disruption, and they don’t want disruption. They simply want to rule. And so yeah, I think Stoicism as a philosophy is very attractive to them and also to people who would like to be wealthy. And as we’ve already kind of talked about, this idea of the American Dream makes people believe that they, too, could be this technocrat in the future. So get with it. But yeah, I don’t think it’s very, I’m much more Epicurean. I know you could probably guess that.
Adam: Yeah. We did a whole episode on the kind of David Goggins, self-help, Tiktok world and again, on some some level, I’m sympathetic, because if there is a drudgery in your job, which, again, I know, I’m sure all of us have here had a drudgery job, you have to hold on to something to sort of make it make sense. But again, there’s a reason why your boss wants you to read Marcus Aurelius, and rather than a union organizer, he’s like, Wait. It’s basically the Mike Rowe sweat pledge. So I want to ask one more question before we go, because we’d be remiss if we didn’t talk about the GOAT, Spartacus, and the Servile Wars and obviously, revolts by enslaved people in general, which, of course, there was quite a few of them. Can we talk a little bit about because again, that would be like the sort of entry point into a discussion about labor that is broadly popular, you know, Kirk Douglas with his shirt off.
Nima: Tony Curtis.
Adam: Sorry, with all due respect to Tony Curtis. Talk about that, the sort of popularity of that narrative, again, it’s reduced to this kind of heroic narrative. But like, where did that, where was that oriented into this broader associations framework, and how people kind of mimic these structures, and what lessons can be drawn from that that are not this kind of cartoon, you know, Marcus Aurelius sitting here telling you how to, you know, how to eat shit and suck it up?
Sarah E. Bond: Well, I think Spartacus as a folk hero does not really gain a lot of steam until around the period of the French Revolution and a little bit before. So in terms of his revival, up until that point, people knew who Spartacus was, of course, he is written about by people like Appian and Plutarch, etc. That we have three Servile Wars. The first one is in Sicily in the end of the second century BCE, then we have another one that formulates out of Sicily a few years later. Spartacus himself is a few decades after that, and he’s not on Sicily. He is breaking out of a gladiatorial school in the area of Southern Italy, and Spartacus is seen by the contemporary sources and the sources that are not long thereafter as a rebel and a rabble-rouser. And of course, they’re not going on strike. They fully want freedom and never to come back to their jobs again. They do not want to return to being gladiators, so they’re not leveraging their labor in any way. They want to go free. And my belief is that they really should have, when they got towards the Alps, to continue going, but they circle back and they come back into the Italic peninsula, and I always want to yell like, Keep going, Spartacus! Keep going! But he’s not a hero in his own day. He may have been with enslaved persons. We don’t have a lot of their narratives or reactions to him, but during the period of the French Revolution, into later political campaigns in the 18th and then 19th and then 20th century, Spartacus gains more and more as a folk hero of freedom and rebellion against tyranny, whether it was in Prussia, where he was extremely popular. He became very popular in France and in the United States, and especially during the Haitian Revolution, where Toussaint Louverture takes the name of Black Spartacus. He’s given that name, but he is seen as, you know, this Haitian revolutionary leading enslaved persons to fight against enslavement within the island of Haiti, right? So all of these things build Spartacus’s hero worship, but the movie in 1960 really is what does it to the highest degree,
Adam: Written by a communist. No shocker there. Written by Dalton Trumbo.
Sarah E. Bond: Exactly. And it’s during the period of the blacklist. You know, they’re blacklisting communists after McCarthyism. That Spartacus is really about fighting against The Man. And I see Spartacus absolutely as the GOAT and a hero that should be celebrated. But we have to also remember that he was working within a gladiatorial troupe, and that gladiatorial troupe lives within the gladiatorial school, and they coordinate together. Spartacus has lieutenants that he works with, but he has a group of people that are very close to him that mobilize in a very planned rebellion in the gladiatorial school. They go to the kitchen, and they grab utensils and knives and break out of the gladiatorial school. And then, as they are moving through Italy, whether to Vesuvius, or whether going north, etc, they are gaining more and more enslaved persons in a very organized manner, up to about 100,000 people.
And this is during a period when Roman slavery had been growing so quickly. Over the past 200 years, Roman slavery had expanded to a level that that had never seen before, and the number of enslaved people was so high within the Italic peninsula. So, I mean, I think Spartacus deserves all of those kudos, but we also have to ask ourselves about other enslaved people into the period of the Empire, and part of that is looking at enslaved people that rebel against Rome, whether they’re mint workers, whether they’re charioteers, whether they’re bear trainers, that we never have a slave revolt that is to the level of Spartacus that we know of within the Roman Empire for the rest of its existence, there’s never a rebellion that is to the degree that Spartacus inspired and carried out, but that there are still enslaved people that went on strike and that engaged in joining collegia.
And so circling back to that first thesis that I was talking about, just because enslaved people exist within a society does not mean that there cannot be labor organization and that there cannot be people working together for a higher purpose, right? And so sometimes that purpose is manumission, and sometimes that purpose is to get higher wages. But just because they’re enslaved does not mean that they’re completely impotent or without any power within this labor economy.
Nima: Well, I think that is a perfect place to leave it. Sarah, this has been so wonderful, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on this Citations Needed livestream Beg-a-Thon. It has been truly wonderful to talk to you, Sarah. We have been speaking with Dr. Sarah E. Bond, Associate Professor in the Classics at the University of Iowa. You do have, like, a longer title: Erling B. “Jack” Holtsmark?
Sarah E. Bond: I’m an endowed chair in the history, I’m technically in the History Department with an appointment in Classics. I have a chair. It does not matter.
Nima: I feel like I need to read that title. It’s very prestigious.
Sarah E. Bond: It doesn’t, well, it doesn’t mean that much, except for, you know, that I feel very lucky to have the job that I do, that this is my job, that I get to do all day. So that’s good enough.
Nima: Yeah, that’s very Stoic of you.
Sarah E. Bond: I see what you did there. I see what you did there.
Adam: She’s the emperor, though. That’s objectively a great job.
Nima: Sarah, of course, is the author of the incredible new book. Adam and I both read it.
Adam: We actually read it. We didn’t fake-read it. We actually read it.
Nima: Man, is it fucking great. So please pick it up. The book is, of course, Strike: Labor, Unions, and Resistance in the Roman Empire, out now from Yale University Press. But Sarah, thank you so much for joining us today on Citations Needed. It has been amazing to have you.

“Though you are a whole world, Rome, still, without love, the world’s not the world, and Rome cannot be Rome.” — Goethe
This book. I had this idea of traveling based on the books I was reading, and after nearly four years in Rome, I realized I had never read a book about the city itself. Perhaps I was too caught up in my daily struggles — and let me tell you, my life in Rome hasn’t been easy. Maybe my expectations were too high, or, as Goethe said, love was simply absent, and Rome wasn’t truly Rome to me. But this isn’t my story. Let’s get back to Anthony Doerr’s memoir.
As I write my humble thoughts on this memoir, I find myself flipping through its pages, revisiting the passages I underlined — the moments that touched my heart, the parts where I saw my own Roman story reflected. To be honest, Doerr’s first impressions of Rome mirrored how I felt after a year, maybe a year and a half, of living here.
I came to Rome for my master’s degree — my second one, actually — not just for academic reasons but as a way to escape Istanbul, to finally do something I had long felt was inevitable. I had always known my story wasn’t meant to unfold in just one city or country, though I had imagined it would be London, not Rome.
And yet, when I finally opened my eyes and truly started feeling Rome, it was exactly as Doerr described: noticing the endless sea of scooters, marveling at (or being horrified by) Italian driving, being simultaneously enchanted and frustrated by the city. In those early days, I was also angry — maybe disappointed — by what I had found here. And as I read through the beginning of Four Seasons in Rome, I could feel that same unease in Doerr’s words.
Throughout the pages, you experience what it’s like to be a parent to newborn twins — and, honestly, I’d much rather live that experience through his eyes than my own. But being in a foreign country doesn’t make it any easier. Even though our circumstances were different, there was one feeling we both shared: navigating this city while feeling lost — most of the time.
The missing piece, though, is love. I’m not sure if I should call myself fortunate, but in that regard, I’ve been quite lucky — if letting my heart get broken over and over counts as luck. I found real love here and lost it here. I cried here. I lost hope here. And yet, to truly experience Rome, love wasn’t necessary. As Doerr writes:
“And what about Rome? Rome is beautiful, Rome is ugly. Something about this city exacerbates contrast, the incongruities and contradictions…”
Rome has a way of filling that void in its own way, making sure you feel everything — whether you want to or not.
In the beginning, or let’s say during Fall, the book feels more factual, focused on adjustment. Doerr shares details about Rome, its quirks, its history. But as we move into Spring and Summer, we witness — or at least I felt — his gradual acceptance of the city, his growing appreciation for its beauty. And in these later chapters, the book shifts into something deeper. Not overwhelming, not philosophical, but it subtly invites the reader to take a step back, to ask certain questions, to reflect.
You should take note of the places Doerr mentions in this book — mostly around Monteverde, one of my favorite areas in Rome.
I’m not sure if anyone would be interested, so I won’t be sharing my full Roman guide, but I do want to give a shoutout to my favorite restaurants for the best carbonara. Why?
When I first moved to Rome, I was almost vegetarian — pescatarian, to be exact. While my friends indulged in legendary plates of pasta alla carbonara, I could only watch and wonder what all the fuss was about.
Then, for love, I started eating meat again. To be precise, I now eat guanciale, Italian cold cuts, poultry, and seafood — so really, there’s not much left off the menu, is there?
Naturally, my return to the eating-it-all era had to start with the famous carbonara. This passion quickly turned into a habit — I now order pasta alla carbonara every time I dine out. Here are some of my favorite spots to enjoy it:
I could go on forever — food is my passion, after all. But I suppose this article was meant to be about a book.
Okay, back to the book:
I’m so envious of Doerr for writing such a brilliantly pure, beautifully written book. No flashy marketing of la dolce vita — God knows I’m tired of the glossy image of Rome when the reality is far from dolce. He presents it all in a way that feels honest, and I couldn’t help but see parallels between the way Rome made him feel and the way I’ve felt since moving here.
I envy him even more because he came to Rome for a set period, with no trouble finding an apartment (thank you, Pope, honestly), which gave him the opportunity to experience the city without the complications that often come with living here. Or maybe the struggle is the true Roman experience. I’m not sure… Rome is my great dilemma and paradox.
Overall, I’m glad I don’t have to experience this city with newborn twins. I’m grateful for the daily challenges of living here and for the chance to experience life in its raw, unfiltered form. Rome is a beautiful city, though flawed in many ways. I can’t see myself growing old here — but that’s for purely professional reasons.
Finally, the author’s writing is captivating. Whether you live here or not, perhaps in another place, you’ll find yourself immersed in his story through his eyes. I absolutely loved this memoir, and it’s definitely a must-read. As he wrote:
“Roma, they say, non basta una vita. One life is not enough.”

When I tossed a small Italian lira coin into the Trevi fountain back in June 1987, it was to ensure my return to Rome someday, in accordance with the famous legend. On the cusp of turning 17, I had all the optimism in the world that I would indeed be back. And I was right. It just took a few decades. But lucky for me, Rome is known for being eternal and was waiting here for me.
A lot has changed since I was last here. My sunken coin is, of course, long gone. The lira isn’t even Italy’s currency anymore, having been replaced by the euro in 2002. Most importantly, I now have a greater appreciation of history than I did as a teenager. Back then, I just wanted to meet European boys, get served alcohol underage, and go out dancing with my friends. My pictures were mostly of our silly fun in hotel rooms or on the bus, and my more serious scenic ones came out dark, blurry, or had my finger in them.
This time around, I plan to mix sightseeing and trying to live like a local for a month, much like I did when I spent 30 days in Paris working remotely last summer. Exploring all of the Roman ruins there inspired me to head right to the source. My great-grandparents came to the United States from Italy, so I also want to soak in the Italian culture on a deeper level and make time for some quiet moments sitting in parks just observing people or while walking ancient roads like the old Appian Way.
I only had a few days to see the famous Roman sites that summer of ’87 so long ago. I was on a “Discovering Europe” group tour of around 50 people, mostly high school students and some parent-chaperones, which was arranged by my high school Spanish teacher. We had 24 days to see nine cities in four countries. Rome was a blur. I mainly remember our tour of the Colosseum, seeing where the Pope lives, and not liking the pizza.
I actually still have the travel journal I kept on that trip and dug it out of storage recently so that I could refresh my memory and maybe have a few laughs. It did not disappoint. Page after page of black cursive handwriting captured my deep teenage thoughts.
“I don’t like Rome at all. Our hotel room is right by a busy street. And just like in Paris people drive like maniacs beeping horns all the time.”
“Today sucked! We had to get up early to see the Palace of Versailles. It was a boring tour.”
“We went to a fast food place called Burger Quick. I only got a soda (6 francs) but the hamburgers I saw were gross! They were so rare!”
“In Venice we went on the most boringest walking tour ever! I was so tired I tried to sleep as I walked.”
I imagine my dusty travel journal being found a hundred years from now by my great-great-grandchildren in an attic somewhere. They would flip through the pages and marvel at the indecipherable writing. Thinking maybe it’s cuneiform or ancient Sanskrit, they take it to an antique dealer to see if it’s worth anything. Maybe even pay to have the cursive “translated” to see what profound insights were captured so painstakingly by hand. I imagine the translator gently revealing the contents to them.
“Well, she talks a lot about long bus rides, gross foreign food, and having to wake up too early for boring tours of churches and palaces. But, you know, things were hard back in the 20th century.”
I might not have had a big interest in art, culture, food, or history during that high school trip, but it did definitely awakened my curiosity about the world and gave me insight into how people in other countries lived. It even opened my mind to the world of politics a bit. In Italy, for example, I saw political graffiti, some of it anti-American, spray painted in English as our bus drove through the busy Roman streets. One night after dinner we strolled through St. Peter’s Square in Vatican City and came across a candle-holding procession of people. Our guide told us that they were protesting the Pope’s election of a man who was believed to be an ex Nazi war criminal. I filed these and other important learnings away in the back of my teenage brain since the highlight of that particular evening (according to my journal) was hanging out on the steps of a church near our hotel, listening to a portable radio and dancing around until our curfew came.
In my first Paris article, I talked about all of the funny mistakes I made on my first trips to Europe, such as washing my underwear and socks in a bidet in my Paris hotel room because I thought it was just another sink. Well, the faux pas streak continued a week later in Rome when I again used the sink to wash my shirts and shorts (a real one this time, not a bidet). I decided to hang them to dry over the railing of my partial balcony, which faced a busy Roman street. When I came back hours later, my clothes were hanging in various spots around the room, still wet. A chaperone soon told us that hanging clothes outdoors so close to the Vatican was forbidden and not to do it. My not-so-bright idea didn’t sit well with housekeeping, nor the papacy, apparently. Who knows though, I bet when no one’s looking, the Pope puts his big pointy hat on his window ledge every once in a while to air it out.
I grew up on the East Coast of the United States, so to me “old” was something that was built a few hundred years ago, not thousands like you see in Rome. My hometown of Bristol, Pennsylvania, was founded in 1681. That’s pretty old for a town in the United States, though it’s certainly not the oldest. For comparison, Philadelphia traces its roots back to 1682, New York City to 1624, and Boston to 1630. St. Augustine, Florida, has them all beat, though, having been continuously inhabited since 1565. Of course, if you head to the Southwest, you’ll find even older places that native Americans built.
One of my favorite places to eat in Bristol is the King George II Inn & Tavern, which is the oldest continuously operating inn in the country. I always thought it was cool that some of our founding fathers came through its doors, including a young George Washington, John Adams, and James Madison. Even France’s Marquis de Lafayette ate there, probably munching on an early variation of a burger and French fries (well, to him it would just be “fries,” I guess). That early fascination is probably why I tend to seek out pubs and restaurants that are considered “the oldest” in the cities I visit, and why I love to stay at historic hotels.
I remember the first time I encountered something much, much older and how it made my head spin with awe. I was working temporarily in London and took a day trip to Warwick Castle one weekend. At 23, I still wasn’t much into history, but since we did a lot of date memorizing in history classes, I remembered distinctly that in 1066 that famous William guy did his conquering thing and became King of England.
While walking around the grounds of the castle he had built, I became fixated on the dirt path I was following, imagining how he might have walked this same dusty path. I could literally be walking in William the Conqueror’s footsteps, I thought excitedly. History really came to life for me at that moment. If only teleportation were a thing, field trips for World History class would be way more interesting.
It’s even more amazing when something so old is still in use. Once when I was in Adana, Turkey, in the late ’90s, my husband and I were in a cab sitting in rush hour traffic and were amazed when the driver told us that the stone bridge we were stuck on was built by the Romans in the 2nd century. Imagine a structure surviving nearly 2,000 years intact possibly being taken down by a distracted driver on their cell phone or fumbling with the radio. I was happy to read years later that they banned cars on it in 2007, and now it’s open only to foot traffic.
The Romans sure knew how to build things to last. The Colosseum would be completely intact today if it wasn’t for earthquakes and people in the Middle Ages pillaging its stone blocks to use for other buildings. Then there’s the old Appian Way. I can’t wait to walk along what’s considered the oldest road in the world (that’s still visible). That expression — “All roads lead to Rome”? Well, this road is the mother of them all. It’s so old, some of the stones still have grooves in them from chariot wheels (and we think potholes are bad). I’m sure I’ll have a time-travel mind melt when I imagine myself walking in the footsteps of historical heavyweights such as Julius Caesar and Spartacus. Though not literally: Caesar’s feet probably never had to touch the ground, being a conquering dictator and all, and well, poor Spartacus was crucified on the old Appian Way along with thousands of other rebellious gladiators.
Starting in late May, I’ll be trying to live like a local while staying at an apartment in the Monteverde neighborhood, just south of Trastevere. It’s about an hour walk from my place to the Colosseum, so I definitely hope to be living away from the tourist crowds, especially since this is a Jubilee year for the Catholic Church, which happens only once every 25 years. There’s no metro stop on my side of the river, but there are buses, trams, and of course my two feet. I’ll need to get in as many steps as I can if I’m going to eat all of the things on my checklist.
I need to redeem my teenage self’s dislike of the one pizza experience I had in Rome, so there will be lots of pizza tasting of all shapes and sizes. I’m not really into meat toppings, so I’ll probably just do plain, but there are some interesting veggies to try on pizza like radicchio, zucchini flowers, and squash blossoms. And of course there’s the pasta. I learned that there are four classics I have to try in Rome: Gricia (ancient), Amatriciana, Carbonara, and Cacio e Pepe. I’m not sure if I’ll work up the courage to try the specialty dishes made with offal (intestines, stomach lining, etc.). Though I’m willing to try meatballs made with cow tail (oxtail) and the famous Saltimbocca alla Romana (veal). There’s also a fancy bologna-like lunchmeat called mortadella that looks interesting.
I’ll also of course make time to do some sightseeing when I’m not working. So much time has passed since my last visit to Rome there’s even been a new exciting discovery. In my teenage travel journal, I wrote that I had visited the Forum ruins where our tour guide Ned told us Julius Caesar was assassinated. But turns out that was wrong. Excavations in 2012 uncovered markings by Caesar’s successor Augustus where he designated the exact spot. Turns out, it happened in the Curia di Pompey, a meeting place within the Pompey Theater complex that the Senators were using while the Senate House was being renovated. In 2023 a raised walkway was built over the excavation site so that visitors could get a closer look.
I’m sure I’ll have many moments where I try to imagine myself living among the ancient Romans. Like Russell Crowe’s character Maximus did in the Gladiator movie, I like to run my hands along tall grasses and plant leaves within my reach. It’s something I do no matter where I am walking, but in a place with lots of history, it helps me to feel connected to the people who were there centuries before me. It’s the same with touching walls, trees, and stones (when it’s allowed). Though my hands won’t be going anywhere near the stone latrine seats of the ancient communal bathrooms that I hope to see when touring the nearby ruins of Ostia Antica. I don’t need to imagine that part of ancient Roman life.
I am, however, open to the idea of using a bidet. In a kind of weird, come-full-circle plot twist, the apartment I’m renting has a bathroom with a bidet right next to the toilet. The place does have a washer and dryer, so don’t worry — my underwear and socks will be properly laundered this time.
Eventually, I plan to document here on Medium how it all went. Until then, follow my stories and posts on Instagram (@pammypez).

In the annals of Roman history, certain names echo with legendary resonance: Caesar, Augustus, Nero. Yet, there are emperors whose legacies, though significant, shimmer less vividly in the collective memory. Among these, Lucius Verus (130–169 AD) stands as a compelling figure, whose reign alongside Marcus Aurelius marked a period of both prosperity and profound challenges for the Roman Empire.
The Path to Power
Lucius Verus’ path to the imperial throne was both unique and a reflection of the complex adoption practices among Roman elites. Born Lucius Ceionius Commodus, his rise to prominence came through a series of strategic adoptions orchestrated by Hadrian to ensure a smooth succession. Hadrian first adopted Antoninus Pius on the condition that Antoninus would subsequently adopt both Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Ceionius Commodus (the future Lucius Verus). This series of adoptions was aimed at securing a stable and capable line of succession.
Upon Hadrian’s death, Antoninus Pius became emperor, and Lucius Verus, alongside Marcus Aurelius, was groomed for future leadership. The true moment of Lucius Verus’ accession began when Antoninus Pius died in 161 AD. In a historic move, Marcus Aurelius, immediately upon becoming emperor, insisted on sharing power with Lucius Verus, thereby elevating him to the status of co-emperor. This decision was groundbreaking, marking the first time in Roman history that the empire was officially ruled by two emperors simultaneously. The co-emperorship was a testament to their close relationship and Marcus Aurelius’ desire for a balanced and shared rule.
Military Endeavors
Lucius Verus’ reign was significantly shaped by his military campaigns, particularly in the East. The Parthian War (161–166 AD) stands out as the most notable. Initially, Verus was criticized for his seemingly luxurious lifestyle in Antioch, away from the front lines. However, under his nominal command, Roman forces, led by capable generals such as Avidius Cassius, achieved significant victories, including the capture of the Parthian capital, Ctesiphon, in 165 AD. These successes expanded Roman influence in the East and brought substantial booty back to Rome, but they also inadvertently introduced a devastating plague that would afflict the empire for years.
Coinage and Public Image
The coinage of Lucius Verus, like that of many Roman emperors, served as a vital tool for propaganda and the projection of imperial authority. His coins frequently depicted themes of victory and divine favor, reinforcing his and Marcus Aurelius’ status as protectors and benefactors of the empire. The imagery on these coins, ranging from representations of conquered territories to symbols of military success, played a crucial role in shaping public perception of his reign.
Architectural Contributions and Public Works
Although Lucius Verus’ rule is less noted for monumental architecture than that of his co-emperor Marcus Aurelius, his contributions to Rome’s urban landscape were not insignificant. He and Marcus Aurelius jointly dedicated the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, transforming a personal monument into a public space of worship. Additionally, the triumphal arches and other structures erected in their honor celebrated their military victories and served as enduring symbols of their joint rule.
Personal Life and Legacy
Verus’ personal life, marked by his marriage to Marcus Aurelius’ daughter Lucilla, was integral to the political and familial alliances that underpinned the stability of their co-emperorship. His untimely death in 169 AD, possibly due to the plague that followed the Parthian campaign, brought an end to this unique period of dual rule. In the aftermath, Marcus Aurelius continued to govern alone, facing further military and social challenges without the partnership that had characterized their approach to leadership.
Lucius Verus’ reign, though overshadowed by that of his more philosophically inclined co-emperor, was a pivotal period in the history of the Roman Empire. His military successes bolstered Rome’s territorial and strategic standing, while his coinage and public works projects contributed to the civic and cultural life of the empire. Despite the brevity of his rule and the challenges that marred it, Verus’ legacy is a testament to the complexities and contradictions of imperial leadership in ancient Rome.
Conclusion
Lucius Verus, often overlooked in the shadow of Marcus Aurelius, was a figure of considerable importance in the Roman imperial pantheon. His unique position as co-emperor, his military accomplishments, and his role in the cultural and economic life of the empire offer valuable insights into the dynamics of Roman imperial rule and the challenges it faced. As we reflect on his legacy, we are reminded of the myriad ways in which power, politics, and personal ambition intersect in the annals of history, shaping the destinies of empires and their rulers.

Since the election in America, I have had to take a few somewhat drastic steps to maintain my sanity, and they began with divorcing myself from any and all news, primarily anything related to politics. Someone else I know called it Ostrich Mode, but I prefer to think of it as Turtle Mode. A complete withdrawal from most of society. Knowing how impulsive I can sometimes be, it’s hard to believe this will be a long-term thing, but you never know.
Therefore, out of fairness to all our writers, I am suspending the acceptance of any new writing at this time. I don’t want to ignore those trying to publish and I realize I risk permanently losing both readers and writers, but my only alternative is to either ignore the publication altogether, or delete it. I would prefer not deleting it at this time. The publication will remain live. I just won’t be accepting any new stories for the time being. I thank you for your understanding, and good luck.
If and when I regain some equilibrium, I’ll let you know and we’ll get back to business.

Bam, here we are, back in his apartment close to Altitude 100, where the chicken drawing has been set straight. The place is clean, relatively orderly now and C. is cooking a gourmet dinner for us. He is French, you can’t teach much more to a French guy who knows how to cook. You mostly sit down and enjoy the food he is making and the show of him making it. The ingredients come out of brown paper wrappings, not from plastic bags. The man loves to show his skill. Nevertheless, he burns a couple of the dishes, possibly stage fright? That’s OK, I think I’m getting used to his way of self-sabotaging his best intentions. So we sit down and eat some very sophisticated, yet burned entrées, under the modernistic chicken gaze.
There is no male gaze anywhere that I can see here, but there is this chicken looking down on us. This brings an offbeat touch to things. I feel safe with him, he is generous and open. His engaged leftism makes me look centrist at best, in many topics and it makes me reconsider some of my positions. He is softly teasing me about working for a big nasty corporation, in marketing of all things. While he is the gauchist journalist investigating big…

Every successful school of thought, religion and system that has endured the test of time has one common precept: When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
It means that if your idea is universal enough to offer food for thought and even some enlightening properties, your approach must be adaptable to changing circumstances, cultures and norms. But with one catch: the core teaching must remain universal and comprehensive — intact.
The saying I quoted earlier comes from the 4th century Bishop of Milan, St Ambrose. He was a theologian and statesman with solid leadership, profoundly shaping early Christian theology and doctrine.
Ambrose was what we call an inspirational speaker. He could wow the audience but didn’t let popularity blur his views. He didn’t let anything dilute his faith and was fierce against heresy. The saying attributed to him tells us about a person who is pragmatic yet has strong integrity.

Migrants poured over the southern border. Many came for jobs after employment options in their home regions had dried up; others were attracted to the excitement and glamour of their destination. Soon the influx began to worry leading politicians, who authorized a series of enforcement actions against select categories of immigrants. Deportations, they believed, would put an end to the mess. No luck: undeterred, the immigrants kept coming.
At last, one politician ventured a proposal. Why not extend the citizenship? Not to all non-citizens, of course — just to one specific, carefully circumscribed subset. But one party was having none of it: “if you give them citizenship,” the party’s spokesman insisted, “you assume (I think) that you’ll still have the same political rights and worship in the same way as you do now. But don’t you realize that those people will take over everything?” The proposal withered on the vine.
The speaker of these lines was Gaius Fannius, consul in 122 BCE and a dogged opponent of Gaius Gracchus’ proposal to extend the citizenship to Rome’s Latin allies. For all its celebrated inclusivity, ancient Rome had residents and leaders who were none too pleased about the continuous stream of immigrants: Fannius’ warning is a distant echo of Donald Trump’s “we either have a country or we don’t have a country.” Romans were as willing as many Americans are today to give this displeasure political and legal expression.
But why undertake this rewriting of late republican Rome in the first place? Partly because in doing so I join a modern conversation about immigration that — in both Europe and America — regularly and explicitly adduces parallels from the ancient world as justification for various kinds of immigration policy. In this article, I’ll examine the sentimental and rhetorical configurations through which ancient Rome (and Greece) are put to work in contemporary discussions of immigration and outline how Romans themselves perceived and responded to immigration during the Republic and Empire. In a second, follow-up article, I’ll explore how mobility in the ancient Mediterranean structurally mirrored 21st-century migration towards Europe and the United States. Ancient history can clarify how we think about recent developments, just not in the way(s) normally assumed.
Let me stress that my own perspective as a formerly undocumented immigrant with emphatically pro-migrant political commitments informs what and how I write. No Tacitean disavowal of bias for me. But I hope that even those who do not share my views on immigration will consider how antiquity can be repurposed in modern conversations about immigration.
Writing in the pages of The Wall Street Journal, Cambridge classicist Mary Beard recently asserted that the Romans “would have been puzzled by today’s hostility to migrants.” Well before the publication of the op-ed, Beard made use of her status as one of Britain’s foremost public intellectuals to offer a liberal perspective — sometimes greeted with viciously misogynistic hostility — on contemporary migrant and refugee matters.
The tradition of roping the ancient world into assessments of modern immigration has been a fixture of British political and cultural discourses for quite some time: Enoch Powell’s infamous 1968 “Rivers of Blood” speech (complete with Vergilian allusion) standing at one end of the political spectrum, with Boris Johnson’s 2006 Dream of Rome closer to the other. As Mayor of London, Johnson has continued beating the classical drum, issuing warnings that Britain will turn into the ancient state least like Rome in its treatment of foreigners — Sparta — should it adhere to plans to reduce its net migration.
On the other side of the Atlantic, another professional classicist has intervened in the immigration debates: Victor Davis Hanson. Not one to be deterred by the prospect of controversy, Hanson waded into the immigration-policy waters with his 2003 hybrid-genre book Mexifornia. After first observing that “America is what Rome once was to hustling Jews, Greeks and Numidians” (p. 51), Hanson goes on to claim in his epilogue that the “freedom and material dynamism of the West are drawing millions to its shores — in the manner that Athens once attracted metics from Asia, and Rome drew Africans, Jews and Armenians” (p. 142). (And as proof that classicists holding forth on immigration can irritate members of the political establishment, one need look no further than Hanson: after introducing himself as a “classicist” at a Capitol Hill briefing the year of his book’s publication, Hanson was reportedly accosted by a Congressional staffer who thought he had heard Hanson term himself a “classist”; the face-off ended with the staffer exiting the briefing in anger.)
Comparisons of modern America to ancient Rome are, of course, nothing new, and so hackneyed by now as to inspire a book-length rebuttal. But in recent decades many of these comparisons have been fueled by anxieties about immigration, particularly of the illegal/undocumented variety. Actress and conservative politician Clare Boothe Luce expressed concern in a 1982 Washington Post interview that the United States might be headed “for the fate of ancient Rome … a city of pollution and noise and foreigners, [that] collapsed under the weight of the barbarians.”
Since 9/11, the argument that a lax immigration policy will hasten the United States’ Rome-like demise has steadily gained traction. A 2004 Florida Times-Union editorial on “illegal immigration and the problems that go with it” ended on this ominous note: “ancient Rome couldn’t, or wouldn’t, stop the influx of barbarians across its border.” Taking to The Washington Post in 2007 to outline a “tolerant but also tough” vision for US immigration policy, Yale Law School professor Amy Chua reminded her readers that the “greatest empire in history, ancient Rome, collapsed when its cultural and political glue dissolved … [i]n part, this fragmentation occurred because of a massive influx of immigrants from a very different culture.” Three years later, Stevens Institute of Technology professor Silvio Laccetti argued that Rome’s extension of its citizenship through the Edict of Caracalla had precipitated an “erosion of civic pride and responsibility” in the course of outlining his own proposal of a tolerant but tough immigration scheme. And in undoubtedly the most entertaining riff on the Rome conceit, Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) went full Cicero on the Senate floor — framing Obama as Catiline — following the President’s November 2014 announcement of an executive order deferring the deportation of undocumented parents of American citizens and permanent residents.
You wouldn’t be wrong to suspect that the genealogy I’ve charted so far has an even deeper history: the practice of invoking the Roman Republic and Empire’s treatment of immigrants as paradigmatic and/or cautionary is already on display in the state- and nation-building discourses of the early modern period. Edward Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire reserves the purplest of its purple prose for the barbarians at the gate and the Fifth Column of immigrant slaves and domestics waiting to welcome them. (Last year, a lengthy rumination — sprinkled with block quotations from Decline and Fall — on Gibbon’s continuing relevance was posted to breitbart.com under the pseudonym “Virgil” and triggered over 1400 comments, mostly effusions of agreement.) Before Gibbon, Montesquieu had sketched the contribution of foreigners and barbarians to Rome’s imperial dissolution in chapter 16 of his Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline.
But well before either, Machiavelli had taken a somewhat different line on immigration in Discourses on Livy, praising Rome’s openness to foreigners as integral to the amassing of the military and economic power through which the republic set itself apart from Athens and Sparta (II.3). Machiavelli wasn’t just anticipating Boris Johnson’s evaluation of Roman greatness as a consequence of open migration. Diligent reader of Livy that he was, Machiavelli was putting his finger on a line of argument that reached back to the ancients themselves.
The history of rhetorically positioning Rome’s treatment of immigrants really begins in antiquity, with both Greeks and Romans chiming in on the fluctuating — and at times very divergent — trends in the Republic and Empire’s openness. Having worked our way backwards in time to the ancients, we should now pause and ask: how open were Romans to foreigners, really? It turns out that Romans were far more ambivalent about immigration than some moderns give them credit for.
In the first decade of the war with Hannibal, a Macedonian king turned Roman adversary praised the Republic’s free and easy bestowal of citizenship in a letter exchange with a Greek city-state. In a world where city-states could be quite stingy with grants of citizenship — especially Sparta, notorious for its deportations — Rome had so succeeded in marketing itself as exceptional that even an enemy felt compelled to take notice. This marketing took several forms, and the one that has left the most durable imprint on literary and non-literary sources alike is Rome’s origin myth.
In contrast to the Greek city-states whose origin stories indulged the fantasy of autochthony (according to which a community and its members sprang up from the earth in the place they inhabited), Rome promoted itself as the product of immigrants. Molded during the turbulent centuries of Italian and Mediterranean expansion, Rome’s legendary history began with an illegal immigrant: pious Aeneas, fleeing with his family and friends from the devastation of Troy household gods in hand, elderly father on his back, young son by his side.
As canonized in the Aeneid, the challenges faced by the founder of the Roman race include some of the traditional (epic) dilemmas of travel — where to go and how long to stay, whose hospitality to accept and whose to decline — Homeric effects translated for a Roman audience. And once Aeneas and his band do arrive on Italian shores, they are denied the happily-ever-after outcome. Their lot is to contend with belligerence, grief, early death.
Some months ago, Michael Fontaine proposed in this publication a reading of the Aeneid’s second half that aligns rather felicitously with contemporary geopolitical events. On one level, the Aeneas myth internalizes the plight of immigrants/refugees (fato profugi); at the same time, it gives form to the mirror anxiety of those native residents who from the first encounter feel that the new arrivals will take their land and resources and women.
Spinning out this thread further, I’d add that the ambivalence towards refugees and immigrants woven into the Aeneas legend reflects centuries of unease at Rome about the presence and role of foreigners. The unease was embodied in the mythic personas of Aeneas, Romulus, and Remus, all three of whom were remembered as thieves, rapists, and murderers. Here comparison with the modern myth of the immigrant as criminal is instructive. Earlier this year, to thumps and cheers, Trump laid out his campaign platform on immigration:
“The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems…When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best…They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us [sic]. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”
Trump and his partisans seem to have a complementary myth at hand: the “Ellis Island” arrivals of virtuous character and exemplary work ethic (unlike today’s purveyors of drugs and crime). Much the same conflict between these two alternate ideals of the immigrant played out in ancient Rome. As Rome expanded, nativist and xenophobic discourses proliferated, with consequences for the waves of immigrants settling down in Rome in the last centuries of the Republic and first few centuries of the Empire.
These discourses had sharp legal teeth. On top of the targeted removals and expulsions of groups identified as religiously and/or philosophical suspect — the Bacchants in 186 BCE, philosophers in 161 and 154, Chaldaeans and Jews in 139 — immigrants hailing from communities elsewhere in Italy were deported on multiple occasions in the years 187–172 (citations and discussion: Noy, Foreigners at Rome, pp. 37–47). Sometime in the 120s, a law was passed expelling all foreigners from the city of Rome; another version of the law was passed in 65 BCE. Thanks to the Severan-era historian Cassius Dio, we know something of the reasons for the second law’s passage (37.9): not only were foreigners believed to be too numerous, it was worried that they weren’t suitable enough (epitedeioi) to live alongside Romans.
It’s worth remembering that throughout this entire time Rome still had a republican system of government. These laws were ratified by popular will and not autocratic imposition. Since foreigners couldn’t necessarily be identified on sight (any romano di Roma stood a decent chance of being physically indistinguishable from an immigrant), it is anyone’s guess how these laws were enforced. The association of specific neighborhoods with certain groups of immigrants may have played a role in the orchestration of round-ups.
We do know that one Roman witness to the law of 65 did not like what he saw. Characterizing this law and its predecessor from the 120s as designed not only to deny foreigners access to Rome but to deport those already living there (eosque exterminant), Cicero declares in the De officiis that “denying foreigners access to our city is patently inhumane” (3.11.47). Although he managed to successfully defend the poet Aulus Licinius Archias from deportation, Cicero laments in a letter to his friend Atticus that the same law had been deployed, out of spite, to condemn (and presumably deport) a freedman assistant to the politician and former consul Aulus Gabinius after Gabinius beat charges of political corruption.
Neither the moral nor rhetorical authority of Cicero could halt the policing and deportation of certain categories of immigrants; the practice persisted well into the Empire. Yet immigrants kept on coming. The satirist Juvenal’s bombastic xenophobe Umbricius couldn’t abide their presence: “Romans, I can’t tolerate the city being Greek. Yet what portion of the shit is really Greek? For a long time now the Syrian Orontes has poured into the Tiber…” (Sat. 3.58–60). But for the Greek-speaking author of The Learned Banqueters, it was precisely Rome’s embrace of different immigrant populations that enhanced its glory: it was a heavenly city, encompassing so many foreign populations as to defy enumeration (Deipn. 1.20b-c).
We should be careful to respect the differences between ancient Rome and the modern US (or Europe). For example, the preoccupation with “border enforcement” wasn’t quite as intense among the Romans — though perhaps the time has come to read Augustus’ reported advice to Tiberius to “keep the empire’s borders secure” (my consciously tendentious rendering of Tacitus’ enigmatic coercendi intra terminos imperii) and/or Aelius Aristides’ praise of the Empire’s walls in his Roman Oration as implicated in a kind of border politics. And at no point in its trajectory from Republic or Empire was Rome a nation in the modern sense.
But with these caveats out of the way, I want to underline a few fundamental similarities between the immigration sensibilities of ancient Rome and those of 21st-century America. Then as now, foundation myths about the state as the creation of immigrants articulated and projected deeply felt anxieties about the legacy of past immigrants and the presence of current ones. Then as now, some of those anxieties were worked out through legal-administrative means, with deportation privileged as a technology of control. Then as now, foreigners stood to lose the most in confrontations between political elites — think back to Gabinius’ freedman. Then as now, the immigrant influx could inspire despair over the country going to rot or euphoria at its cosmopolitan inclusivity. Then as now, immigrants were vulnerable to hate crimes.
Hate crimes, you say?
Earlier this year, “Death to Islam” was spray-painted on the wall of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Heritage Association center in Spokane, Washington. Thousands of hate crimes are reported in the United States each year. These figures — dismayingly consistent from year to year — probably underrepresent the true number of hate crimes perpetrated. Setting aside for now the reliability of the FBI statistics, I want to concentrate on the graffito as medium for xenophobia. Even for the spray-painter, there is ancient precedent.
At some point during the second century CE, a tombstone was set up in Rome under the supervision of a certain Charitonius Mercurius for a deceased cavalry officer. From the tombstone we learn that the officer — whose name is not preserved in what remains of the inscription — was of Arabian extraction (natione Arabus); he’d lived to the age of 35, soldiering for 16 of those years and attaining the rank of eques singularis along the way. Many examples of this type of inscription survive, but in this case the real kicker comes in the form of a Greek graffito left behind by someone, possibly a fellow cavalry officer, that reads: Θ. Ἄραπσι (“Death to the Arabs!”).
The cultural and linguistic complexities of xenophobic resentment in Imperial Rome were such that a Greek-speaking resident of Rome could scrawl an ethnic taunt on a monument to a Latin-speaking native of the Near East. Romans were quite skilled at the use of graffiti to mock the immigrant Other: the late second/early third-century CE graffito from the Palatine featuring a donkey on a crucifix and the tag (again in Greek) “Alexamenos worships God” may be the earliest example of such visual denigration being applied to Greek-speaking Christians residing in Rome — and takes us back to the anxiety voiced by Gaius Fannius that immigrants would menace religious practices at home.
But my interest in summoning up the ghost of the graffito artist who marked up the tombstone has to do with the fantasy of violence folded into the tag. The cavalry officer was already dead, else he might have had a thing or two to say to the violator of his memorial. Alive and far more vulnerable was the homeless Mexican man recently beaten by two Boston men, one of whom claimed as his inspiration Donald Trump’s call to deport the undocumented.
Trump’s rhetoric justifies the commission of acts of violence against immigrants by characterizing them as inherently violent. On the stump, he has bemoaned the scourge of rapists, murderers and thieves originating not only in Mexico but “coming from all over South and Latin America and … coming probably, probably, from the Middle East.” It doesn’t seem to register among his fans that the “problem” of immigrant crime is a fiction: multiple studies carried out over the past century have repeatedly confirmed that immigrants commit crime at lower rates than the general population. What does register is the fear-mongering, especially among those already inclined to believe that white Americans are endangered: in July a petition was posted to WhiteHouse.gov asking President Obama to honor Trump “for opposing white genocide.”
Once the immigrant is construed as an existential threat, xenophobic sentiment rallies around the idea of removing that threat by any and all means necessary. Both in ancient Rome and in modern America, the fear of immigrants activates not only the desire to remove their bodies from sight through deportation, but to deprive them of life — to destroy them.

December 1, 2024First Sunday of Advent, Year CSt. Stephen’s UMC, Burke, VARomans 8:18–25 (NRSVUE)**A Sermon Series on Fuquay’s The Way to Bethlehem
For this season of Advent — a time of anticipation and preparation for the coming Christ — we will base our sermon series on Rob Fuquay’s book titled On the Way to Bethlehem: An Advent Study.
Throughout this series, we will visit four key places, starting with Rome, then moving to Jerusalem and Nazareth, and finally arriving in Bethlehem. My prayer is that as we embark on this journey together, the Spirit will guide us closer to the humble manger in Bethlehem, where we encounter Love Incarnate — God-with-us — the one named Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, and Prince of Peace.
You may wonder why we start with Rome. All the other locations seem straightforward. The Gospel of Luke begins in Jerusalem, where the angel announced Elizabeth’s pregnancy to Zechariah who was serving in the temple. Then it moves to Nazareth, where the same angel announced the pregnancy news to Elizabeth’s much younger cousin, Mary. Afterward, Mary and Joseph had to travel to Bethlehem, where Jesus was ultimately born.
So, why does this Advent journey start in Ancient Rome?
Just like how people consider Washington D.C. as a focal point of America’s power and influence, Rome symbolizes the power and influence that makes up its empire which stretched vastly across Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, including the regions of Judea where much of the New Testament narrative takes place.
This Roman Empire is often regarded as one of the most successful civilizations in human history. During the period of the Pax Romana, which means “Roman Peace” in Latin, the empire experienced centralized governance, economic prosperity, cultural flourishing, and relative stability — all the things we, humans, across time, hope for in their governments.
A key factor contributing to the period of the Pax Romana was the infrastructure developed under the reign of Caesar Augustus. During his forty-year rule, Augustus oversaw the construction of approximately fifty thousand miles of highways, creating an extensive network of roads that facilitated travel and communication. This network boosted trade, streamlined administration, and enabled the spread of ideas across the empire. Additionally, these roads allowed Roman legions to move swiftly, ensuring rapid responses to uprisings and external threats, thereby solidifying Rome’s control over its vast and diverse territories.
While the Pax Romana brought unprecedented peace and prosperity to Roman citizens, it came at a steep cost for many, particularly noncitizens and marginalized groups. High taxes were levied to sustain Rome’s massive military and ambitious infrastructure projects, disproportionately burdening conquered peoples and lower classes. Enslavement was widespread, with millions of individuals from conquered territories forced into servitude to fuel the empire’s economy and labor needs. Noncitizens lacked the legal protections and privileges of Roman citizens and were frequently exploited or oppressed under imperial rule. For many, the Pax Romana was not a time of peace but one of subjugation, inequality, and suffering under the heavy hand of empire.
Mary and Joseph were among those living under Roman occupation as Jews, part of the conquered peoples and noncitizens of the empire. And their journey to Bethlehem was not one of choice but of obligation, prompted by a decree from Caesar Augustus, calling for a census. And this census was a common tool of an empire, often used to increase tax revenues to support its vast ambitions.
So, imagine how these conquered people, including Mary and Joseph, felt as they trudged toward Bethlehem. There might have been a sense of helplessness as they complied with orders, knowing they had no choice. Perhaps there was skepticism and fear, wondering what new demands or hardships might further complicate their already difficult lives. Perhaps they felt resignation and complacency, accepting their reality that the only way to survive was to serve the empire without resistance. Or maybe they felt the weight of defeat and hopelessness, quietly echoing the psalmist’s cry: “How long, O Lord?” (Psalm 13).
Although we are no conquered people, perhaps we can relate to them in some way — especially to the feeling of helplessness before the forces that shape our lives. On a systemic level, we recognize policies and systems beyond our control that bring harm, prioritize profit over people, and perpetuate inequality or suffering, impacting countless lives, especially those who are marginalized and voiceless. On a personal level, we acknowledge forces that harm us and leave us feeling defeated, despite our deep longing for change — whether it be chronic illness, long-term addiction, destructive habits, abusive relationships, or loneliness. Scripture calls these forces, which operate on personal, systemic, and cosmic levels, “principalities and powers” (Eph 6:12). These forces can feel like chains of bondage and captivity, leaving us yearning for liberation and longing for a hope that can break through and set us free. This is the very starting point of our journey: Rome represents the seat of these principalities and powers, a place where “our hopes and fears are released and sometimes collide.” Thus, Advent begins with longing — longing for change, longing for freedom, longing for justice, longing for peace, longing for deliverance, longing for salvation, longing for the Savior.
Out of Israel’s longing for a Savior, Jesus Christ was born.
But that is only half of the Advent story.
The other half of the story is
that out of our longing for a Savior, Jesus Christ will come again.
Isn’t that the mystery of faith we proclaim?
Christ has died; Christ is risen; Christ will come again.
So, let me ask you:
The Apostle Paul speaks to our experience of longing in today’s scripture, written to the house churches in Rome who were expecting Jesus’ return within their lifetime. Their waiting for the coming of Christ met with the harsh reality of suffering. As you know, they were the church in Rome, the very seat of principalities and powers. Once again, in the midst of suffering, they longed for change, redemption, and restoration; they groaned for their Savior.
Paul writes to their experience, emphasizing that it is not just they but the whole creation that groans together for salvation, as if enduring the pains of labor. In other words, their shared suffering is not the end — it is a hopeful anticipation of new birth and new life. Although all they could see and feel now is indescribable pain, Paul encourages them to wait in eager longing and hope, for a wonderful gift of future glory is on the way.
And this expectant groaning of labor pains still applies to us today. We continue to wait in hopeful anticipation for new birth and new life, even in the face of the present sufferings in our world, which we experience and for which we intercede. And we remain hopeful because of the first fruits of the Spirit: the glimpses of God’s kingdom, the moments when the Holy Spirit moves among us, and the gifts of grace we witness every day through Christ. In other words, we remain hopeful because our God intercedes for us in our collective suffering.
Consider the glimpses of God’s kingdom, the moments when the Holy Spirit has moved among us, or the gifts of grace we have witnessed. These phrases often describe experiences that exceed our expectations and understandings. These capture divine surprises that defy our skepticism and cynicism. These embody the extraordinary love we receive from those who reflect Christ. These first-fruit experiences are what keep us hopeful in our suffering. And our state of hopefulness in labor pain produces in us not only trust and firmness in the faith, but also a different way of living. Through our words and actions, we reveal an alternative way of being in the world through sharing the gifts of the Spirit with those around us.
Again, I find Paul’s metaphor of labor pain brilliant. I remember being in a delivery room for almost twenty-four hours, being next to my wife as she endured intense pain and extreme fatigue. And we were there pushing for this baby to come out in hopeful anticipation, without any idea of what this baby would become, what gifts she would bring to our family, or how her presence would alter our lives.
As Paul writes in today’s scripture, hope that is seen is not hope, but we hope for what we do not see. And we do so with endurance, steadfastness, and perseverance — which are what the translated word patience tries to convey. I think this is both the most beautiful and frustrating part of our Christian journey: we do not hope for what is seen but for what we do not see. Our hope lies not in absolute certainty but in humble mystery. Our hope flourishes not in human preference but in divine imagination.
This is the very movement of our faith journey, revealed through the story of Advent. Out of Israel’s longing for a Savior, Jesus Christ was born in the most unexpected way possible — in a lowly manger as a helpless baby. Out of Creation’s longing for a Savior, Jesus brought salvation to us in the most unexpected way possible — through death on a cross and resurrection. Out of our longing for a Savior, Jesus has and will continue to reveal himself to us in unexpected ways. And out of the whole Creation’s longing for a Savior, we believe Jesus Christ will come again in the most unexpected way possible.
Dear church, let me ask you these questions once again:
Whenever we think about these things, we often wish — perhaps most of the time — that God would just act like a human empire, issuing decrees to put a swift end to our misery and all human sufferings. We wish God would just tell us imperatively what to do so we no longer have to deal with all these problems.
But, as the book On the Way to Bethlehem beautifully describes,¹
God does not decree. Rater, God births. God sends a baby, a Son. A Son who would be killed by the empire under which he was born, suffering a Roman crucifixion. Why? So that something new could be birthed in our hearts. Whatever change needs to happen in our world begins with our being born again. For what does creation wait for with eager longing? “For the revealing of the children of God.” [That’s] us, born again.
Despite how much we might wish the church could operate like an empire, the church is called to be more like a harvest field — patiently spreading the seeds of God’s kingdom in all soils, with hope that those seeds will sprout and grow in our hearts. Only then can we be born again, yielding a harvest of fruits to be shared with the world.
As we begin this Advent season, I pray that seeds of divine imagination take root in our hearts. May the story of Christmas be more than an occasion to revisit an old tale. May it become an invitation to leave behind our “Rome” with hopeful anticipation. As we draw closer to O little town of Bethlehem, may Christ be born anew in our hearts, and may we, too, be renewed and born again in Christ.
In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

What to read before your Italian adventure!
There can’t be a definitive list of books to read before going travelling to a glorious new destination, but I tried to find and read as many recommendations as I could before my trip to Florence and Rome, and here are the books that I found most enjoyable and interesting.
My top choice funnily enough, was from a series of books called Horrible Histories that I read when I was younger, and found that it had the most comprehensive whistle-stop tour of ancient Rome presented in an entertaining manner for a busy but curious traveller.
The Ruthless Romans is full of jokes, anecdotes, and important historical figures. It covers Ancient Rome from 1000 BC - 476 AD and is shockingly dense and informative for such an easy read. If you don’t have any time at all, try reading this on the plane to da Vinci airport.
Between the collapse of the Republic and start of the Roman Empire is a key piece that I read in high school: Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare. I don’t think you need to read Shakespeare before a trip, but if you like me have fond memories of sitting in class mesmerized by a political conflict written four centuries ago about a historical event from a couple of millennia ago, then you’ll remember the irony that in killing Caesar for his assumed monarchic intent, the Senate all but ensured that “another Caesar” would eventually take over Rome as its first emperor: Augustus.
To go off on another minor nostalgic tangent, if Shakespeare is too much of a commitment before a trip to Rome, Asterix hilariously covers the Roman campaigns that lead to the events in Julius Caesar.
For some real, serious history, these two were the most recommended:
Unfortunately I only managed to dip my toes in them before my trip and they were very dense and informative.
On a lighter note, I did breeze through Angels and Demons. It was an action-packed thriller that plays fast and loose with facts.
I liked that it covered Vatican City, which none of the previous books do, and touched on the works of Botticelli and Dante, who were both all over especially Florence and Rome.
For Florence, I’ve been reading The Enchantress of Florence that does an incredible job setting the stage for what the world was like in the 16th century and how interconnected Italy, Turkey, India and everything in between were by trade links and travellers.
Some other books by Italian authors and set in Italy that I didn’t have a chance to read but would like to in the future are:
And to throw it in there because it was everywhere, especially in Florence where Dante’s bones aren’t: The Divine Comedy.

The plan was to end the day at the Villa Borghese gardens, but with twenty more minutes of walking and legs already exhausted from a full day on foot, it didn’t seem worth it.
Instead, I stopped on a pedestrian terrace along the busy Via Frattina, not far from my hotel.
A glass of red wine, a seat outside, and a bit of people-watching paired with a book. It’s a great exercise to avoid reaching for your phone when you’re sitting alone.
The café held me for about half an hour, soaking in the buzz of the street and the taste of the wine.
Once the last sip of Italian red was gone, I headed back to the Bulgari hotel to get my power bank. Yes, I was staying at the Bulgari hotel, and no, I can’t afford it. That’s a story for another time.
As I approach the reception, five people in uniform turn to face me.
I ask if I can grab something from my bags, which were stored in the luggage room, and a beautiful young man smiles at me, “Of course. Follow me.”
We walk into the room, and he leads me to my things.
“Oh, so you don’t need this. You know which ones they are.” I say quietly, as I glance down…

Non-members of Medium can read the full article here.
I first visited Rome with my family a few years back. We were planning to do the main touristy things, but when faced with the endless queue in St Peter’s Square, we had a change of plan and a wander down to the river instead.
I’d not done much research for the trip, unusual for me, but I wasn’t organising it — my role was just to turn up and enjoy! So I had no idea what other attractions were within walking distance. But we were pretty sure there would be a cafe where we could sit and watch the world go by fairly close by.
We walked past the street sellers, their souvenirs spread out on tarpaulins, and approached the river. My attention was drawn to the building on my left, first the light stone walls, then the darker brick of the heart of the castle, and I was hit by the strangest feeling of déjà vu. I knew this building, it’s curved ramparts, the flagpole on top. But this was my first trip to Rome. Why was a place I’d never been to so familiar?

Rome might be it for me. The one. The city above all others. The one you find yourself Googling flights to late at night, even when you’ve just arrived home from your last trip.
I think we all have places like that.
A few months ago, I visited Rome for the fourth time. One of those times was a month-long trip and I can tell you, it was one of the highlights of my three-year-long travels. I never wanted to leave because Rome has exactly what I love in a city. Beauty. Atmosphere. And one of my favourite food and drink cultures in the world.
Yes, there are tourist traps. Yes, some places will give you a raw deal in bad pasta, bad pizza and bad wine. But there is also value to be found. You can find pizza that will do things to you. You can eat pasta that will ruin every other pasta you eat henceforth (it’s that good).
If you want to eat and drink well in this city, you’ve just got to know where to go.
Every day in Rome starts with a caffè and a maritozzo — Rome’s famous cream-filled…

Rizky Bayuputra for LC Life
LE CITOYEN — Ancient Rome is undoubtedly a civilisation to be looked upon. Albeit known for their ‘pagan extravagance,’ the ancient Romans did, however, conquer and create a nation state that ranged from the borders of Scotland to the deserts of Arabia, reaching its height in the 2nd century CE and influence modern western life more than any other ancient civilisation (alongside the Greeks). However, there are only a few good examples of films and TV series that depict Roman life as it should. Films such as Gladiator, despite its well-written plot, presented a lot of inaccuracies. Meanwhile, TV-series such as Spartacus were, well, rather vulgar — not saying that Roman society wasn’t like that — but for a historical TV show, it showed parts of Roman culture that should have been, let’s say, set behind curtains and exaggerated at that! However, one TV series has put me, as an avid enthusiast of all things Greco-Roman, to stop my various nitpicks and just sit down and enjoy. With an unbelievably stellar plot and deep research into Roman life, the HBO Series Rome (first launched in 2006), terribly underrated in comparison to the likes of Game of Thrones, is what I could say (and most historians do agree) a highly-authentic depiction of Roman life.
Albeit historians having pointed out a few inaccuracies (especially in the timeline), what HBO’s Rome brought was much better: authenticity. It immersed yourself into the world, made you care about the characters, and anxiously sit on your chair as you watch the series go on, waiting for what other secrets of Ancient Rome might be uncovered.
Overview
Over two seasons, the TV miniseries Rome follows Lucius Vorenus (played by Kevin McKidd) and Titus Pullo (played by Ray Stevenson), two soldiers of the Roman legion and therefore Roman citizens, as they go through turbulent times in Roman history. Vorenus and Pullo are both members of the plebeian class–or the common citizenry–of Rome back in the dying days of the Republic and so gives us a lot of new perspectives on ancient Roman life. While also following the high politics of Gaius Julius Caesar (played by Ciaran Hinds, who later featured in Game of Thrones as the wildling King, Mance Rayder), and his civil wars against Pompey, which is already a recurring theme as depicted by popular media, such as multiple films on the life of Caesar and most well-known the plays written by one William Shakespeare, it does not relieve us of the grit and severity of the common man’s life.
Historically, the Romans operated on a not-so-rigid class system dictated by ancestry and wealth. The three classes of Roman citizens, which are the Patricians, Equites (or Knights, who became important mid-level civil and military officials as well as cavalrymen), and Plebeians (common citizenry, who became tradesmen, merchants, artisans, rank-and-file soldiers), lived very different lives and worked different livelihoods. The Patricians, or the senatorial class, act as the primary ruling class during Republican times. Patrician families were allowed entry into the senate on the basis of their wealth and ancestry. Some Patrician families claim descent from the Gods (Caesar’s family, or the Julii Caesaris, claim their descent from the goddess Venus) despite their claim to a seat of senator is mostly based on their ancestry, drawing back to early or pre-Republican times. Famous senatorial “gentes” (or clans) include that of the Cornelii (for example, Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus, the victor of the Battle of Zama against Hannibal Barca in c. 202 BC), Junii (for example, the overthrower of the last King of Rome, Lucius Junius Brutus), the Porcii (Marcus Porcius Cato, famous Roman orator, though the younger one live in Caesar’s times).
Not surprisingly, descendants or the adopted benefactors of said gens lived in the timeframe depicted in Rome, represented by members of the Optimate faction, which consisted of traditionalist Roman senators who wanted to preserve oligarchic rule in defence of Republican institutions, including Scipio Metellus, Marcus Junius Brutus (descendant of said Brutus, played by Tobias Menzies, later as Edmure Tully in Game of Thrones), Gaius Cassius Longinus, and Marcus Porcius Cato the Younger, all serving under the charismatic brilliance of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, Caesar’s once-ally and nemesis. These characters go up against, in the damnably byzantine politics and battlefields of antiquity, the Populares faction, with Gaius Julius Caesar at its head, and Marcus Antonius (popularly known in his anglicised form of ‘Mark Antony,’ depicted as a fantasist, narcissist, brutal and temperamental soldier by Antony Purefoy’s brilliant acting) by his side.
The two main protagonists, Centurion Lucius Vorenus and Legionary Titus Pullo, are members of the Roman Thirteenth Legion, of whom Caesar led through his long Gallic wars. Rome goes through the plebeian lives of the two soldiers, introducing not only events in history, but also of Roman culture through daily life, something I found very interesting. As there are too many aspects of Roman life depicted within the HBO Series (and thus the corresponding budget, which was the reason why it was cancelled after its second season), we will take it from a few aspects and how every film set in a historical background or piece of literary fiction should take into account to bring said world into life.
Traditions and Religion
Roman religion and tradition is deeply ingrained within its society. Notably, the Roman state and religion were never seen as two different things by Roman society. The various cults and sects of the Roman pantheon, along with the various deities of Jupiter (the king of the gods, lord of the sky and thunder), Dis (god of the underworld, most notably used by soldiers and fighters especially in damning a certain thing), and even Vesta were depicted with superlative detail. Note the sacrifices conducted in some episodes, the reading of omens, the praying to small figurines in a homely shrine, and the entry of one of Vorenus’ daughter into the Vestal Virgins later on in the season.
The Vestal Virgins themselves were one of the most interesting parts of Roman tradition and religion; they were selected from highborn women at a very young age to enter priesthood and vowed to be chaste for the next 30 years in order to cultivate the sacred fire, located in the temple of Vesta. Vesta herself was the Roman goddess of the hearth, marked by the existence of Vesta’s sacred fire which must not be let out under any circumstances. Superstition was, that if the fire died, it meant that the goddess had abandoned her protection of Rome–meaning that the infernal city itself was under grave danger.
Aside from religion, Rome also depicted many other Roman traditions, such as the patricians’ obscene eating habits of lying down on sofa-like furniture while conversing and getting absolutely drunk as well as exceptionally extravagant, drug-filled orgies. One other interesting event in Rome was the marking of the coming-of-age. Every male Roman citizen was given the right to wear a toga at the age of sixteen (or seventeen, depending on which is closest to 15 March of the year) and therefore participate as adults in civil society. The depiction of Octavian’s (the future Roman Emperor Augustus) coming-of-age rite of passage was depicted at the near-end of season one, something that would drastically change his way of thought and vibrate his transition from boy to man so visible in the transition of seasons.
Also quite interesting was the portrayal of tradesman guilds. In the series, the Herald (the rather bulky fellow with iconic hand gestures) in the forum of Rome mentions in an ‘advertisement’ of sorts, the Roman Guild of Bakers, while mention of guilds of smiths of some sort took place throughout the series.
Aside from Roman religion, Jews were also featured. Timon (Lee Boardman), one of the supporting characters, is depicted as a cutthroat sellsword serving Atia of the Julii (Polly Walker), in more than one way. He is dragged in a conspiracy when the Tetrarch of Galilee (Jewish Royalty) arrives in Rome for ‘adminsitrative business.’
Military Service and Tactics
Military service was a large part of Roman life. Soldiering was considered honourable and serving Rome was, after all, a citizen’s unwritten obligation. In the dying days of the Republic, the Romans had already established a professional volunteer army (in comparison to levied troops, which was the system that prevailed up into the 18th century), allowing the fighting of successive wars all across her borders and the gradual expansion of the Pax Romana. Citizen-soldiers like Pullo and Vorenus were obliged with 20 years’ service and were entitled to a percentage of booty and war prizes. After retirement, ‘old legionaries’ may sign up again to become evocati, or veteran troops, serving as the crack troops held in reserve in battles, who earned multiple times the wage of a normal soldier and were immune to menial duties. This took place when Vorenus decided to take Mark Antony’s offer to join his army as a ‘Prefect of the Evocati Cohort,’ a traditionally equestrian position, of which Vorenus had achieved (Equestrian status was achievable after the ownership of 10,000 sesterces in assets, after all). He also had to go through an interesting rite of passage to get it.
Roman military tactics were depicted according to commentaries of the time, such as the Comentarii de Bello Gallico by Caesar. Roman legionaries fought in close formation, standardly going in formation 10-across and 8-deep (in a rectangular formation of 80 men each, called a century). With shields raised, legionaries covered their sectors, and watched for each other. Upon a certain amount of time, the centurion would blow a whistle to signify the change of the foremost front man, and the first-ranker quickly switched to the man behind him. This allowed equal distribution of the fighting, thus allowing Roman legionaries to fight longer than their counterparts. This was depicted well in the opening scene (perhaps the Battle of Alesia) and the epic Battle of Phillipi (in the second series) between Brutus and the second Triumvirate (Octavian Caesar, Antony, and Lepidus). Uniforms and arms were also accurate to the era, with the Roman soldiers wearing in variation of military tunics in scarlet and off-white (undyed) colours, while wearing lorica hamata or mail cuirass, instead of the inaccurately portrayed lorica segmentata (segmented plate armour cuirass) often used in games and films. This type of armour was not used in the time of Caesar, however, and came in the later Imperial period of the first century to third century AD, in limited use. The ‘square’ Roman shield (scutum), the pilum and pila (throwables or javelins), and the gladius hispanensis (Spanish sword), the Celt-inspired republican helmet (galea) along with the not-so-famous Roman sarcina, or luggage, which each legionary brought their own, were also pictured widely.
Turmoil and Squalor
Viewers could often see the tough-living, dirty, and ragged streets of Rome, then one of the most populous and advanced cities throughout the Mediterranean. Even the home of the Vorenii, where Lucius Vorenus and his family lived, was not as fancy as one would think of the ‘extravagant’ Romans. Many of the citizens of Rome lived in poverty and in a state of squalor; murder was not uncommon, and gang fights over disputes were perhaps the way most citizens preferred it to be finished. Courts of law did exist in Rome, but not really portrayed within the TV series.
Another interesting fact was that the Romans often used grafitti to express themselves. Naturally, due to this, the walls of the small streets in Rome were decorated with entertaining, and sometimes perverse, pictures courtesy of Your Fellow Citizen.
Clothing and Fashion
Roman society also had its dress codes. Formal occasions were marked by the wearing of the toga (broad, purple-stripe for senators, two stripes for equestrian/knights, and a plain white for plebeians) for men, although in day-to-day life, a tunic–a piece of cloth that went down to above the knees–were worn. For the regular citizen, these tunics were mostly plain and sometimes dyed, though for nobility, the tunic was often decorated with embroidery to display status. The Romans did live by the code ‘you are what you wear’–perhaps something that lives down to Italians today.
For women, the stola was the most common dress, in tandem with the toga. Stolae were somehow a timeless piece, with variations worn from the times of the mid-republic (3rd century BC) up to the late Byzantine Empire (15th century AD). Women who wore the stola were seen as graceful and honourable, and this was depicted in the various forms of the stola, from a light, near-transparent garment to the rich deep red and/or other colours of whatever Atia of the Julii (a depiction of a woman of extravagance) wore throughout the series. Stola were mostly worn by married women, to display modesty and maturity. Younger women often wore tunics inspired by the Greek chiton (as were many parts of Roman culture).
Despite in a short space of two seasons, it was remarkable how much of ancient Rome was able to be portrayed by the series. The antics of Titus Pullo, the stoicism of Lucius Vorenus, the extravagance of Mark Antony, the grace and shrewdness of Cleopatra, the smart power-plays of Caesar, and the idealism of Brutus were all depicted well within Rome. Although it was cancelled, it had managed to amaze many ancient history enthusiasts with its authenticity and exploration of each character through personal and interpersonal conflicts. If you want to create a period drama, just write for fun, or want to binge watch something exceptionally, and I say again, exceptionally, good, Le Citoyen highly recommends HBO’s Rome.
Plus, if you’re waiting for Game of Thrones’ final season, and want to watch a series of a such (but based on real events), go watch it. Wherever you can. Go! Go!
Salutations.

Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus.
I know what you’re thinking.
What a name!
I agree.
Sadly, the man with this name is responsible for a lot of naughty nonsense.
First off, he murdered his own mother.
If that wasn’t enough, he also murdered his first wife.
And his second wife?
Kicked her to death while she was pregnant.
Yeah, we’re dealing with a monstrosity.
Sadly, his cruelty wasn’t just reserved for his close family members.
He also used to host parties where he’d light people on fire (usually Christians) while he and his guests would frolic to fiddle music.
All while, Rome was engulfed in flames.
The guy was a psycho.
And in this article, I’m going to go all in on the lad known as Nero: Rome’s most notorious emperor.
Nero was the fifth Roman emperor, ruling from 54 AD to 68 AD.

Helpful hints on how to have a miserable but interesting time in the Eternal City.
Listen, I love Rome. I really do but now that we’re more or less free to travel again, I feel compelled to fill you in on the Eternal City. Masochists will love it. So will anybody else drawn to stress and anxiety. Don’t get me wrong, Rome has a lot of things going for it. Historical buildings, pizza, magnificent museums, pizza, stunning churches, pizza. Did I say pizza? Over four million tourists a year visit the Eternal City and, for the most part, Rome is prepared. Yet there are a few trouble spots that can turn a Roman holiday into a Roman nightmare.
Rome is always crowded and those walking tours led by tour guides with flags or umbrellas only make things worse. These human centipedes shuffle, and I do mean shuffle, along the sidewalk and hold up the rest of us with places to go. They’re everywhere but particularly dense around the Vatican Museum and the Trevi Fountain. Especially the Tevi. The Fountain is hemmed in by narrow streets that funnel pedestrians into the site like sheep to the slaughter. Good luck with getting a clear view. Keep in mind there are equally…

Book Review: Are We Rome? The Fall of an Empire and the Fate of America by Cullen Murphy,https://medium.com/@desireewinns/book-review-are-we-rome-the-fall-of-an-empire-and-the-fate-of-america-by-cullen-murphy-6ba9c929abf2,"Sign up

Is America the new Roman Empire, and if so, will it meet the same fate? This book argues that America and Rome are similar in terms of their psychology and soft power, from the way Washington and Rome view themselves as the center of their worlds, to the global and historical impacts of their cultures. In the beginning, Murphy notes Freud’s comparison of the human psyche and the ruins of Rome, the possibility of histories existing simultaneously rather than one after the other. It’s a theme that runs throughout each chapter as Murphy compares the militaries, borders, people, and cultures of Rome and America. Considering how much Roman culture and iconography shape the ways Americans symbolize and discuss their own power, it really does seem like Rome and America exist together. However, Murphy posits that America’s capability for relatively rapid social transformation (especially in just two centuries) is what separates it from its doomed predecessor, and what will save it from the same fate. I’d pick this book up if you’re interested in learning how the cultural and psychological power of empires expands beyond centuries. In the end you’ll definitely wonder if Rome ever did fall.

Rome is a city of amazing pizza, pasta, and gelato, but if you’re looking for a healthy break from all those delicious carbs, here are 4 great places where you can get fresh juices and smoothies:
Esco Sazio — This adorable little shop offers completely organic juices and smoothies, in addition to healthy sandwiches and salads. Swing on one of their wooden swings as you drink your juice and enjoy the chalkboard-meets-chandelier ambiance. Our girls loved the chocolate banana protein smoothie, and I enjoyed my tropical juice with pineapple and guava.
Via dei Banchi Vecchi, 135, 00186 Roma, Italy
Pronto — We stumbled across this restaurant in Rome’s Monti neighborhood, near the Colosseum, and stopped in when we saw their “fresh juices” sign. Their fruit is freshly chopped, juiced, and blended (if you get juice with pears in it) right in front of you, and the three juices that we tried were all fantastic. You can take your juice outside and hang out at the fountain with the locals while you drink it and take in the area’s energetic vibe.
Via dei Serpenti, 163, Roma
Aromaticus — This restaurant is also in the trendy Monti area, and they serve fresh juices and clean, mostly raw and unprocessed foods (salads, hummus, beef tartare, etc.). The shop itself is cute and hip, decorated with vintage cookbooks and selling potted herbs and gardening supplies, and the food and juice are excellent. The pineapple-mint juice was one of the best juices I’ve ever had, so perfectly sweet and delicious, and Joshua loved his Greek salad with pita bread, hummus, cherry tomatoes, olives, and feta cheese.
Via Urbana, 134, 00184 Roma, Italy
AllBiOne — Self-described as “organic street food”, AllBiOne serves organic juices, cut-up fresh fruit, and 14 different kinds of organic meatballs… everything from beef and tomato or chicken and curry to vegetarian eggplant parmesan or ricotta and pecorino cheese balls. Everything we ate was tasty, but I highly recommend the cheese “meat”balls, and the juices we got were fresh and delicious.
The restaurant is a short walk from the Colosseum, and the owner is really friendly — he overheard us talking about wanting strawberries in a juice for the girls, and he offered to make a strawberry-apple-orange juice for them that wasn’t listed on the board; it turned out to be perfect for them!
Largo Corrado Ricci, 34, Roma, Italy
Do you know another great juice bar in Rome? Leave a comment and share it with us!

We had been waiting 30 minutes for the tour to begin. Stepping into a small spot of shade, I wiped the sweat from my face. It was only 10:30, and already the temperature had soared to 95.
“I thought this tour was supposed to start at 10,” I grumbled to my husband, who was also angling for shade.
“It was also supposed to be a private tour,” he said. “But there are 19 of us.”
My husband and I like private tours when we travel, to avoid the sort of scenario we were currently experiencing. Group tour guides are informative and engaging, but there are always tourists who can’t keep up, want to cut the excursion short, or show up late.
Today, two people hadn’t shown up. The excursion was supposed to be a nine-hour walking tour of Rome, and I was ready to get started. Our guide, an Italian woman with thick, black hair and a round face flushed with heat, tried to keep the 19 tourists in our group cheerful.
“Just a few more minutes. I believe the late ones are coming,” she chirped, forcing a smile. “Ah! Here they are!”
I watched as two grumpy blonde women trudged through the crowd towards our group. One was youngish, her expression…

As is well-known, Rome was founded by the legendary brothers Romulus and Remus, who originated from Alba Longa and belonged to one of the Latin tribes. However, as Rome grew into a vast and powerful state, the Romans decided having only local Italian shepherds among their ancestors wasn’t very prestigious. It would be much cooler if the Romans descended from a well-known, celebrated people in legends, even better — from a great hero. And they found such a heroic ancestor. He was Aeneas, a hero from Troy who left his homeland after the city’s fall.
This legend did not immediately become widely accepted among the Romans. The 1st-century BC Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus presents three versions of the Roman origins he knew: Italy, Libya, and Greece. In the last case, he refers to Greek colonists who had long lived on the Apennine Peninsula. However, Dionysius favored the view that the Romans were of mixed Greek-Italian origin. At the same time, Dionysius mentions the Roman version that Romulus and Remus were sons of Aeneas, implying that Rome was built by the second generation of Trojan refugees.

Celebrating the Western tradition, from Romulus to Rembrandt.

The traditional story of Rome’s founding is a classic tale, one that every schoolchild used to learn. One of the greatest civilizations of the Western world, Rome shaped our modern society more than any other ancient culture (with the possible exception of Greece). To understand the incredible story — somewhat dubious historicity aside — is to gain insight into the folklore and heritage that have inspired twenty-five centuries of thinkers, creators, rulers, and ordinary people who looked backwards at the mistakes and achievements of the past for wisdom and direction in the present.
Many charge that learning such tales in the Digital Age is anachronistic at best and exclusionary at worst. But there is undeniably something transcendent about them, a special quality that explains Rome’s unique ability to capture the hearts and souls of luminaries from every time and place, from Dante to Gibbon to Toni Morrison.
Studying the history of ancient Rome ought not to be an exercise in self-flagellation, in which one allows the often-savage realities of the ancient world to overshadow the innovations and triumphs of an extraordinary time. Instead, it ought to be a celebration of the grandeur that was Rome, imperfections and all, and a recognition of the seminal role she played in shaping the West.
And so without further ado I present the traditional and mythological history of Ancient Rome from its founding to its fall in three parts.
On April 21, 753 BC, the twins Romulus and Remus stood atop a rather unremarkable Italian hillock — it was known as the “Palatine” — and founded a small settlement that would rise to become one of the most dominant and lasting empires in world history. This ten-part survey briefly traces the traditional and legendary history of Rome, over the course of which I shall attempt to answer the crucial question: how did a diminutive encampment on the Palatine rise to global dominance, and what became of its grandeur?
Our story begins at Troy. According to legend, in the 1200s BC a titanic struggle was waged between the Greeks and the Trojans, inhabitants of a city known as Troy upon the Dardanelles in modern-day Turkey. The cause of the war was divine; three of the most prominent goddesses in the Greek pantheon (Hera, queen of the gods; Athena, goddess of wisdom; and Aphrodite, goddess of sexual love) found themselves in the midst of a passionate disagreement over who was the most beautiful. To settle their dispute, Zeus (king of the gods) appointed Paris, a Trojan prince, as judge. Attempting to sway Paris, each of the three goddesses offered him a precious reward should he choose her, but it was Aphrodite’s offer — that he be wed to Helen, wife of a Greek king called Menelaus — that was most convincing to the Trojan squire. Her promise was swiftly delivered upon, and Helen was spirited away from the court of Menelaus to the high walls of Priam, king of Troy.
War followed forthwith, as Greeks hastened to Troy to support Menelaus and reclaim his snatched wife from Paris. The fighting was intense, lengthy, and heroic — much of it is retold in Homer’s Iliad, most especially the exploits of a Greek general named Achilles. At last, supported by many of the gods and aided by cunning trickery in the “Trojan Horse” (a fake peace offering that in fact contained Greek soldiers within its belly, allowing the marauders to flood the city by night and open its gates to the invaders waiting outside), the Greeks breached the walls, and began to pillage and burn.
From the carnage escaped a particular Trojan prince — Aeneas, a son of Venus — accompanied by a retinue of comrades. In search of friendly lands and a place to found a new city, he set out from Troy by ship and, after an arduous journey, arrived on the shores of North Africa to a city called Carthage (modern-day Tunis), the home of Queen Dido. The people were friendly, milk and honey flowed, and, most notoriously, Dido and Aeneas fell into the throngs of love for one another, a rather scandalous affair for the previously-unbetrothed Dido and the now-uxorious Aeneas. Alas, this was not to be the Romans’ final home; for Hermes, the messenger god, flitted down to Aeneas, whom he found strutting bejeweled atop the high walls of Carthage, and bore to him a fateful message from Zeus himself: Aeneas must head to Latium (the region of Italy around modern-day Rome), as was his fate. Immediately, devoted Aeneas (or pius Aeneas, as goes the famous Latin phrase) set out, and soon reaches Latium. However, his departure was not casualty-free; in a fit of woeful despair at seeing her lover gone, Dido stabbed herself to death, leaving a final curse on the Trojans that shall reappear later in this survey. Much of the tale of Aeneas’ journey to Rome, it should be noted, is retold in Vergil’s Aeneid.
Thus we conclude the first chapter of Rome’s history, with Trojan ships on Latian sands.
Having shored in Italy, “Aeneas f[ound] not peace but another terrible war” (Ragan, Survey). A local king, Latinus, sparked conflict when he betrothed his daughter Lavinia to the newly arrived Aeneas instead of the man to whom he had already promised her, Turnus. In the ensuing strife, in which the Trojan-Latinus coalition fought Turnus and his local allies, Aeneas slew Turnus and subsequently married Lavinia. He died in another skirmish shortly afterward.
Aeneas’ body was never recovered, but his name remains forever etched into the towering stele of Western civilization, a fleeting ember of once-mighty Troy rekindled into the blazing inferno that was Rome. His legacy would be taken up by his young son Ascanius (also known as Iulus). The year, as legend has it, is circa 1175 BC.
Thirty or so years later, Ascanius founded the town of Alba Longa in the nearby Alban Hills, about twenty miles east of the Seven Hills that will later mark the famous site of Rome. Ascanius is the first in a 400-year line of Alban kings — the so-called Silvian Dynasty — that ends with King Proca and his two sons: Numitor (the elder) and Amulius (the younger). Upon Proca’s death sometime in the 8th century BC, Numitor, being the elder brother, ought to have inherited the throne. Amulius, however, had other plans, and he usurped the throne, murdered Numitor’s sons, and cast Numitor himself into exile. In a rather Machiavellian twist, wanting to end his brother’s bloodline Amulius forced Numitor’s daughter Rhea Silvia to become a Vestal Virgin, consigning her to celibate priestesshood.
Divine intervention followed forthwith, and Rhea Silvia became impregnated by Mars, the god of war [virgin pregnancies tend to resurface, no?]. Amulius orders the products of the pregnancy, twin boys named Romulus and Remus, to be left on the banks of the Tiber River to perish [cue Moses…]. Escaping doom, the twins were found and nursed by a she-wolf who brought them to a cave known as “the Lupercal.” Soon thereafter, the infants were found by a shepherd, Faustulus, who took them in and raised them as his own (along with his wife, Acca Larentia). Eventually, having discovered their family background and having learned of the injustice Amulius had wrought, they wrested back control of Alba Longa and restored Numitor, their now-agéd grandfather, to the throne. Wrongs thus righted, the brothers set out, looking to found a city of their own.
The twins and their followers journeyed west to a marshy spot near the Tiber River, ringed by seven hills: the Palatine, the Quirinal, the Viminal, the Esquiline, the Caelian, the Aventine, and the Capitoline. Romulus surmounted the Palatine hill and began setting the boundaries of a new hamlet, Rome. The legendary date of this founding is April 21, 753 B.C. Remus, in brotherly scorn, leapt over the Rome’s diminutive walls. Romulus, ever the patriot, felled his brother with his blade, declaring, “Sic deinde, quicumque alius transiliet moenia mea” — “Thus henceforth to anyone who should o’erleap my bulwarks.”
Rid of pesky Remus, Romulus set to the task of governance and growth, making Rome (specifically the Capitoline hill) an asylum that welcomed all who wished to join the new town. Unsurprisingly, such an arrangement attracted a less-than-ideal rabble — the men were raucous and criminal, the women sparse. Stung by a neighboring tribe’s refusal to provide their daughters in marriage to the Roman ruffians, Romulus announced a Festival of Neptune (the sea god) in his new town, attracting scores of local tribespeople. With the beady eyes of the Romans fixed upon the Sabine daughters — the young, gallivanting women from the Sabine tribe — Romulus gave the signal, and the Romans rushed out from their hidey-holes, each seizing a Sabine lass for his own and absconding back onto the fortified heights of the Palatine. The festival, needless to say, quickly dispersed.
The Roman snatching — or, as it became known, “The Rape of the Sabine Women” — was rather poorly received by the duped Sabines, who quickly armed themselves and prepared to make battle. Skirmishes ensued, but the final engagement of the war, the Battle of the Lacus Curtius, was ended when the Roman wives (yes, the very Sabine girls who had only recently been kidnapped) threw themselves into the fray and demanded that conflict cease in an event often called “The Intervention of the Sabine Women.” Impelled to peace, the two towns merged, the new entity jointly ruled by Romulus and Titus Tatius, the king of the Sabines.
Around this time Romulus went about planting the societal seeds that would sprout into the grand trunks of Roman civilization. To one hundred hand-picked followers he gave the title “patres” — “fathers”. These men would serve in an official capacity as his advisory council, the Senate. The descendants of these early “fathers” would later be known as the “patricii,” or “Patricians.” The rest of the citizenry were merely the “plebs,” or “Plebeians.” From the union of these two delineated strata (the Senate and the masses) comes the famous phrase SPQR — “Senatus PopulusQue Romanus,” or “the Senate and People of Rome.” Another division of the city — thirty “curiae,” named after thirty of the Sabine women who had intervened — provided the voting units of the “Comitia Curiata,” or “Roman Assembly.”
Over the next several years of his rule (by now Titus Tatius had perished during a riot in nearby Lavinium, leaving Romulus the sole king), Romulus oversaw the city’s continued growth as it pressed outward in conquest. In the late 8th century B.C., Romulus died when, while surveying the troops arranged on the Campus Martius (Plain of Mars) from the Quirinal hill, a cloud enshrouded him. When the cloud lifted, Romulus was nowhere to be found — either murdered in a conspiracy by the Senators or, as the Roman historian Livy more dubiously asserts, ascended to heaven under the auspices of Mars. Romulus was later deified under the name “Quirinus,” attracting a significant cult following. He reigned for thirty-seven years, the first of Rome’s “Seven Kings.”
Thus we conclude the second chapter of our history of Rome, with Romulus dead and a new king, as we shall soon see, poised to spring from the ashes.
Somewhat unusually, the Roman kingship was elective: The Senate nominated new kings during the interregna that followed monarchs’ deaths (during which nominating process various Senators would serve as temporary rulers), and the Assembly confirmed or rejected those nominees. The arrangements surrounding Romulus’ succession were no exception; the lengthy, one-year interregnum that followed Romulus’ death saw ten Senators rule as interregnes, or “between-kings,” before a worthy successor was nominated and confirmed: Numa Pompilius, Rome’s second king.
Numa Pompilius: The Pacifist and Priest (r. 716–673 BC)
Numa’s accession betokened a city exhausted from the constant conflict and rapid expansion of Romulus’ reign: more scholar than fighter, Numa was famed for his disciplined lifestyle, religious dedication, and vast wisdom. Numa’s selection marked a successful compromise between the Roman and Sabine factions of the population — though himself a Sabine himself from the town of Cures, Numa was uncontroversial and widely respected, characteristics that rendered him acceptable to each of the bickering factions.
Numa is chiefly remembered for his pacifism and his institution of the sacra, Rome’s religious traditions. Among his first decrees as monarch was the dissolution of the guard that had comprised Romulus’ personal entourage — an act both of peacemaking and self-preservation, as the guards’ loyalty was questionable. One of Numa’s most significant contributions was the establishment of several priestly orders, including pontifices and flamines (higher and lower classes, respectively, of standard priests), the Salii (the twelve so-called “leaping priests” of Mars), the fetiales (the priests who advised the Senate on treaties, foreign affairs, and official declarations of war), and the Pontifex Maximus, the high priest of Rome. Most significantly, he imported from Alba Longa the Vestal Virgins — the famed priestesses of Vesta (goddess of the hearth) who, as ceremonial stewards of all Rome, kept her sacred fire aflame. Numa also constructed several temples, including the famous Temple of Janus, whose doors were closed during peacetime and flung open during wars. Tellingly, the doors remained closed for Numa’s entire reign. Another of his lasting contributions was the institution of a twelve-month calendar adjusted to the solar and lunar years, with provisions for “holy” and “unholy” days.
Throughout his reign, Numa asserted his direct connection to the gods by means of his marriage to Egeria, a nymph who supposedly furnished him with divine directives upon his periodic visits to her. Numa died of old age in 673 BC, having presided over a long period of peace and productivity in the city on the Tiber.
Tullus Hostilius: The Warrior (r. 673–642 BC)
Where Numa was priest, Tullus was warrior. Scornful of the religious obsession that had settled over the city and believing Rome to have grown “soft” under Numa’s pacifism, Tullus Hostilius set about renewing the military prowess the city had enjoyed under Romulus and sought to expand its imperium, or “sphere of influence” (later “empire”). Tullus waged war on several neighboring peoples, including the Sabines (whom he defeated with a cavalry charge in a battle near Malitiosa Forest, inflicting heavy casualties), the confederated Veientes and Fidenates (whom he defeated even despite the treacherous retreat of Rome’s Alban “allies”), and even Alba Longa, the ancient birthplace of Romulus. It is this final conquest for which Tullus is best known today.
Cattle begat the strife. When a small herd of the beasts (owned by a Roman farmer) wandered into Alban territory, and the relevant landowners refused to return them to Rome, Tullus did what any reasonable leader might have done: He declared war against all Alba Longa. Undaunted, the Albans marshaled themselves under their king, Cluilius, and marched to the outskirts of Rome. Quickly, they dug a trench — the aptly-named Cluilian trench — around the entire city. Soon, though, Cluilius perished of unspecified causes. [“Cluilius… moritur,” the Roman historian Livy helpfully elaborates: “Cluilius dies” (Ab Urbe Condita, 1.23.4).]
To replace Cluilius, the Albans appointed Mettius Fufetius as military dictator, granting him absolute command over the city and its forces. The two leaders — Tullus and Fufetius — drew up their armies into battle and marched out to face each other. Neither side wanting to wage what would surely be a bloody and destructive war — for the neighboring Etruscans would have looked on with glee as their two main territorial rivals tore each other to shreds, ready to swoop in and conquer the weakened victor — Fufetius suggested a more efficient resolution: a duel. Miraculously, each army had among its ranks a set of triplets: the Romans had the Horatii brothers, and the Albans had the Curiatii brothers. The teams of brothers would fight to the bloody death for their countries, and Tullus and Fufetius each entered into solemn vows pledging that they would abide by the outcome of the fight. I borrow from Ragan’s Survey to recount the conflict that ensued:
The contest was exciting: with two Horatians slain, but all three Curiatians wounded, the surviving Horatius began to flee! The Romans no doubt groaned, thinking their champion a coward. But there was method in this. For as he ran, he succeeded in separating the pursuing Curiatii whom he was able to fight individually and each of whom he killed. So, the Albans surrendered themselves and their town. The Romans, however, characteristic of these early wars, took the Albans as a whole into their citizen body; the town was destroyed — except for the temples — so that the Albans would become fully a part of their new community.
So, with that, Romulus’ hometown was no more, living on only in the memory of its now-Roman residents. A final finishing twist to conclude the conflict: the Alban dictator, Fufetius, soon proved a treacherous man. In the aforementioned Roman war against the Fidenates, it was he who pulled the Albans back from the fight, intending to linger in the backdrop until a winner was evident, at which point he would march out in “victory,” pretending to have supported whoever won. But Tullus was no fool: perceiving Fufetius’ treachery, he bade his calvary raise their spears, shielding the retreating Alban “allies” from view of his infantry and thus keeping the Roman morale intact, preserving Rome’s shot at victory. After the battle, Tullus punished Fufetius (also known by his first name, Metius) as he saw fit. I leave it to Vergil to recount the gory details of Metius’ death as he is ripped limb from limb by four horses (Aeneid Book VIII, tr. John Dryden):
Near this, the traitor Metius, stretch’d betweenFour fiery steeds, is dragg’d along the green,By Tullus’ doom: the brambles drink his blood,And his torn limbs are left the vulture’s food.
In addition to these military conquests, Tullus is notable for his construction of a new Senate building — the Curia Hostilia — which lasted for over 500 years after his death.
Alas, for all his military grandeur Tullus had neglected to honor the gods, and soon the city was afflicted with plague and famine as recompense for his scanty religiosity. Desperate, Tullus turned to the writings of his predecessor Numa, the expert on all things divine, and frantically yet inaccurately attempted to perform the rituals described therein. The gods, in no mood to tolerate such tomfoolery, struck Tullus with a thunderbolt, setting both him and his palace alight and bringing an end to his 31-year rule.
Ancus Marcius: The Builder (r. 640–616 BC)
Perhaps weary again of conflict and conquest, the Romans chose the more subdued Ancus Marcius — grandson of Numa — as their fourth king. Where Tullus had erred in the eyes of the gods, Ancus charted a safer course: his first act as king was to have the religious rites laid down by Numa copied down and displayed to the public, lest they ever again be ill-performed.
By Ancus’ time, Rome had become a profitable and well-positioned town controlling a respectable portion of Latium, the territorial region around the city. The city lay along the Via Salaria, or Salt Road, an ancient trading route that proved a welcome boon to the growing city. Taking advantage of the city’s strategic position, Ancus sent out a colonia (colony) of citizens to found Ostia at the mouth of the Tiber, a crucial expedition that secured the surrounding salt flats (providing a reliable revenue stream for the fledgling city) and extended Roman territory to the sea. He constructed the first bridge across the Tiber, the Pons Sublicius (Sublician Bridge), in 642 BC. The continued arrival of Etruscans from the north, skilled engineers in masonry, road construction, and swamp drainage, further complemented Ancus’ infrastructure projects. He built Rome’s first prison, the Mamertine Prison (which, in the following centuries, housed a number of high-profile prisoners, including Vercingetorix, Jugurtha, St. Peter, and Sejanus), atop the Capitoline hill. He fortified the Janiculum hill on the west bank of the Tiber, dug a ditch fortification (the Fossa Quiritium) on the city’s landward side, and constructed Rome’s first aqueduct.
Though more peaceful than his predecessor, Ancus did not shrink from conflict; he fought against the Latins, conquering the town of Politorum (whose residents were relocated to the base of the Aventine hill in Rome) — and later reconquering and destroying it when it was re-settled by more Latin peoples — along with Tellenae, Ficana, and Medullia, a conquest that brought loot to the coffers of Ancus and resettled Latins to the base of the Palatine hill. These resettlements, along with a growing population and increasing social stratification, helped form the early stages of the plebeian class at Rome. Furthermore, he expanded Roman territory into the Maesian Forest, seizing it from the Veientes.
After 24 years of successful rule, Ancus, the last of Rome’s Latin-Sabine kings, died, bringing to a close a period of economic and territorial expansion, infrastructure development, and social growth for the adolescent town on the banks of the Tiber.
Thus we conclude the third chapter of our brief history of Rome, with four successful kings etched into the people’s memory and new rulers from the north poised to take the throne.
During the reign of Ancus Marcius (640–616 BC), a talented man named Lucomo arrived from Etruria, a civilization to the north of Rome, with his wife, Tanaquil. Lucomo brought his peoples’ skill in engineering, stonework, and logistics; Tanaquil, their prowess in omen interpretation. According to tradition, this power couple was destined for greatness from the moment of their arrival at Rome: As they approached the city, an eagle swooped down, stole Lucomo’s hat, and quickly replaced it. Tanaquil, the “impartial” wife and observer, deemed this an omen of his future greatness.
Biased as it was, Tanaquil’s observation soon came to fruition. At Rome, Lucomo took the name “Lucius Tarquinius” (“Priscus,” meaning “Elder,” was later added — we shall soon see why), gained access to the city’s high society through favor and courtesy, and, eventually, became a friend of the aging Ancus. So close an associate of Ancus’ was he that the king named him guardian of his two sons, both mere youths. But this was a decision that would prove fatal for the line of poor Ancus.
With old Ancus on his deathbed in 616 BC, crafty Tarquin (or, more likely, the ambitious Tanaquil) sent the two sons on a lengthy hunting expedition. When Ancus died shortly thereafter, Tarquin leapt into action, making a case for his own election to the kingship before the Curiate Assembly (the thirty-tribe popular assembly presided over by the king — recall the thirty curiae named after the intervening Sabine women), a case he bolstered with bribery. Needless to say, he succeeded: The two sons, away on their jolly hunt, were exiled, and Lucius Tarquinius Priscus — better known by the anglicized Tarquin the Elder — became Rome’s fifth king.
L. Tarquinius Priscus: The Engineer (r. 616–579 BC)
Scurrilous accession aside, Tarquin oversaw a period of necessary construction, military success, and effective reform in the Eternal City. Though often overtowered by the whirlwind of reforms wrought by Servius Tullius, his successor, Tarquinius Priscus’ fruitful reign ought not be overlooked.
Many of his engineering projects became the defining monuments of Rome. He built the Circus Maximus (a chariot-racing arena) at the base of the Palatine hill; he laid the foundation for the Temple of Iuppiter Optimus Maximus (the High God of the Roman pantheon) on the Capitoline hill, to be completed by his son; and he constructed a massive sewer, the cloaca maxima, to drain the swamp between the Palatine and Capitoline hills, which would later become the site of the famous Roman Forum. He also continued the construction of walled defenses around the entire city.
On the military front, Tarquin initiated a war against the neighboring Latins, seizing the town of Apiolae and a great deal of booty, instituting annual games as celebration. (He would go on to take and assimilate additional Latin cities in subsequent offensives.) He then weathered an Etruscan-supported Sabine assault with exceptional difficulty — fighting spilled into the streets of Rome, and the Sabines were only barely repelled. Following an initial surprise attack that inflicted heavy losses, the Sabines withdrew to prepare for another offensive. Livy recounts the dramatic second skirmish (Ab Urbe Condita I.37, tr. Aubrey de Sélincourt — an edition from the Heritage Club that I heartily recommend):
Hostilities with the Sabines were now resumed. The striking-power of Rome had been increased by the expansion of the cavalry [which Tarquin had completed during the Sabine respite], but in what followed it was a strategy that played the decisive part. A stack of dry timber which had been lying on the bank of the Anio was set alight and the blazing logs thrown into the water. A good wind kept them burning, and many were carried down by the stream and became lodged amongst the piles of the bridge, which they set on fire. This was alarming enough for the Sabines while they were fighting, but worse when their resistance broke; for the burning bridge prevented their retreat, and large numbers of them escaped the enemy only to perish in the river. Their equipment floated down the Tiber to Rome, where it was recognized for what it was and brought the news of victory almost before a messenger could get through.
As terms of the parley that followed, Rome received the Sabine town of Collatia, in which Tarquin placed his nephew Egerius as commander of the Roman garrison. Following the victory over the Sabines, Tarquin celebrated a triumph, or general’s victory parade, on September 13, 585 BC. However, this conflict poked the Etruscan bear, for they had supported the Sabine effort; twelve Etruscan cities banded together and seized a Roman outpost at Fidenae, a town to the north of the city. This seizure kicked off a bloody conflict that saw Tarquin lead the Romans against his native civilization. Rome was victorious, subjugating the truculent Etruscan cities and gaining great wealth.
Tarquin’s remarkable successes carried over into the social and political realms. To stave off the Sabines (see above), he had expanded the number of cavalry centuries from three to six — thus doubling the size of the equites, or knight class. He increased the Senate by one hundred members — importantly, among whom was a man from the gens Octavii, the family of Rome’s first emperor 600 years later. He introduced many Etruscan military, political, and religious rites that later became hallmarks of Roman rule.
Tarquin went as he came, surrounded by divine phenomena and urged on by his ambitious wife. I leave it to Ragan to report the strange story (Survey):
A very unusual event occurred one night in the royal nursery. The woman watching the sleeping children (both royal and household children were there) screamed when the hair of one of the children, a slave-woman’s [Ocrisia’s] son, seemed to be on fire. This brought Queen Tanaquil who, when she saw that the fire was not harming the child, took this as a sign of destiny for the child. She convinced her husband that the child, Servius Tullius, was thus designated by the gods to succeed to the throne. Some years later, Tarquin’s earlier treachery against Ancus’ sons caught up with him. One day, as the king was giving audience to citizens, a foreigner asked to speak to the king in private, on a matter of great importance. The king agreed and, when alone, the man (hired by Ancus’ exiled sons) took an ax to the king’s head and escaped. Tanaquil, wanting to secure the succession for Servius, carefully managed the situation as the king lay dying. She would give out daily reports about this recovery — knowing full well he was dead — all the while securing the support she would need to gain the kingship for Servius. This done, the death of Tarquin was divulged, and Servius Tullius, formerly the son of a slave, became the sixth king of the Romans.
And so Servius Tullius, once a slave boy, took power at Rome.
Servius Tullius: The Slave (r. 578–535 BC)
Servius was a king who knew his origins — his allegiances lay with the Plebs, the people, rather than with the aristocratic Patricians and noble families of the old order, to whom he seemed a mere “populist demagogue” (Ragan, Survey). Indeed, throughout the reigns of Servius and his successor, Tarquin the Proud, the Roman citizenry came into its own, earning participation in government and power in administration. Perhaps, though, the collapse of the old order brought the state down with it — the excesses and exiguities, triumphs and trivialities, virtues and vices of the Roman Kingdom crumbled under Tarquin the Proud. But all that is to come.
Servius’ great triumphs were social. In a reform known today as the Servian Constitution, he organized the Roman citizenry into five classes according to wealth, rather than to birth. The specific mechanism of this system — divided according to the armor each man could afford in wartime — relieved the poorest of their military duties. To accomplish this feat, he instituted the first census, or counting of Rome’s citizens and property, overseen by a censor. This division resulted in the Comitia Centuriata (the Centuriate Assembly), a body consisting of 193 “centuries” into which all Romans were sorted. However, while theoretically granting the Plebeians a voice in governance and law, the Comitia Centuriata did little to ease the Patrician [moneyed elite] chokehold on Roman administration — 180 of the 193 centuries consisted of the wealthiest estates, granting 5% of the Roman populace deciding power in all matters of state. (This unbalanced representation was accomplished by a crafty grouping of the classes: While the lowest estates had hundreds or even thousands of members, the highest ones had very few — think of a radical version of the U.S. electoral college.)
Though seemingly unbalanced, this division aptly reflected the contribution each class made to the Roman military: The highest classes were expected to contribute vast funds and troops to the city’s military endeavors, while the lowest ones contributed nothing at all. A democracy? No. But an accurate reflection of the relative weight and import of military matters in ancient societies? Yes. Before we leer at this classist system with a modern eye, perhaps we ought to recall Burke: “A true natural aristocracy is not a separate interest in the state, or separable from it. It is an essential integrant part of any large body rightly constituted. It is formed out of a class of legitimate presumptions, which taken as generalities, must be admitted for actual truths.” Political philosophy aside, Servius’ reforms laid the political, legal, social, and ideological bases for the Roman Republic to come.
​Class questions aside, the developments under Servius extended beyond his Constitution. Legend has it — though an archaeologist perhaps doesn’t— that he constructed the Servian Wall, enclosing 608 acres and all seven of the famous hills of Rome (Servius had expanded the city onto the Quirinal, Viminal, and Equiline). For the pauper, he was a prince: He eliminated debt imprisonment and eased the tax burden on the lowest classes, albeit in exchange for a paucity of political representation (see above). Furthermore, he entrusted the precariat to its land, labor, and liberty, dividing public land and letting the poor farm and tend to themselves. He divided the people of Rome into four tribes and the entire country into thirty one. He founded a very important shrine to Diana on the Aventine Hill, a shrine that became the administrative center of a critical alliance between Rome and the Latin League (an alliance of neighboring tribes and communities aligned against Roman expansion). For the first time, Servius energetically delineated the bounds of citizenship: His Constitutional ukase placed freedmen within his classes, thus enfranchising former slaves and bolstering the citizen base. Additionally, Servius established several religious festivals, most notably the Compitalia (celebrated in early January each year).
Before we recount the pitiable end of old Servius, let us recap Rome’s status at the end of his reign. Rome had expanded territorially, occupying all Seven of the famous Hills. Her citizenry was divided by wealth, not birth. The Servian Constitution had laid the basis for the Republic that was soon to come. Rome’s geopolitical situation was strong, with alliances secured with the Latin League and the Etruscans. Freedman and poor alike were newly protected and empowered.
Alas, Servius’ humble origins returned to haunt him. I once again defer to Ragan to recount the death of Servius and the ascendency of his successor, Tarquin the Proud (Survey):
Servius’ origin, however, continued to plague him as the Roman aristocracy felt demeaned, being ruled by a former slave. Thus, Servius Tullius married his two daughters, both named Tullia, to two sons (or grandsons) of the former King Tarquin [Tarquinius Priscus]: Tarquin (called Superbus, “the proud, arrogant”) and the younger Arruns. That Servius knew the characters of his daughters and his sons-in-law is shown by his matching. Tullia the Younger, married to Arruns, was as ambitious and conniving as her true love, the man she most admired, Arruns’ younger brother; Tullia the Elder, a devoted, if simple, wife was utterly unlike her conniving, ambitious husband. [i.e the ambitious and conniving Tullia the Younger was married to the simple and devoted Arruns; the simple and devoted Tullia the Elder was married to the ambitious and conniving Tarquinius Superbus. Tullia the Elder pined for Tarquinius Superbus (and vice versa), and was bound to get her way, a marriage from Dante’s Hell; trouble stewed in each couple’s nuptial hours.] Livy puts it rather succinctly: “Two deaths soon followed,” and the surviving Tullia and Tarquin joined in marriage and conspiracy. Working long behind the scenes, when Tarquin decided it was time to act, he boldly went into the Forum to the Curia (Senate House), sat on the royal throne, and proclaimed himself king before the shocked populace. Tullia shamelessly appeared in public and, from her carriage, heralded her husband’s usurpation. Hearing the clamor, old Servius came into the Forum (the Regia, or royal palace, was nearby) and attempted to resist Tarquin. The younger man hurled his father-in-law down the steps and, as he was led home, wounded, sent assassins to finish him off! Livy adds a gruesome touch: As she was coming home in her carriage, Tullia saw the body of her father deserted in the street. She ordered her driver to drive over the body, splattering the carriage with blood, and taking the curse home. The street where this happened was called thereafter Via Scelerata, Street of Crime.
Scandal, shock, scurrility — these were the accoutrements of Tarquinius Superbus’ accession. Where Tarquinius Priscus had pomp and pageantry, Superbus had profligacy and perfidy; where old Numa had decorum and decency, Superbus had depravity and debasedness; and where Romulus had valor and vigor, Superbus had vanity and villainy. The blood splattered on the wheels of Tullia’s cabriolet betokened more than the death of a helpless elder; it presaged the end of a mighty chapter in Rome’s history. The tale of Tarquin the Proud is one of crime for all ages.
Tarquinius Superbus: The Tyrant (r. 535–509 BC)
And so we come to Tarquin the Proud, as all histories of the Roman Kingdom must, the final king of the great house of Tarquin. His cognomen, “Superbus,” (translated as “proud” or “arrogant”) tells all. Ragan aptly characterizes his rule: “That bloody and inauspicious act was only the beginning to what became a despot’s reign of terror. As is the case with all tyrants, no class or individual was spared from Tarquin’s jealousy or cruelty” (Survey). Indeed, so wretched was the rule of Tarquin that he made the title of rex, or king, forever hateful to the Romans, inscribing his name with blood on the tapestry of Roman descent. As Cicero questioned in his Republica, “Are you not aware that it was the insolence and pride of one man, Tarquinius, that made the title of king odious to our people?”
Ambition, wealth, and disregard make a vile combination; Tarquin began his reign with a murderous romp. He refused to entomb old Servius, and executed any senator whom he deemed a “loyalist” supporter of Servius, seizing their property for his own and reducing the size of the Senate. He mustered a bodyguard to facilitate his haughty uninhibitedness. Livy captures his philosophy on governance: “Without hope of his subjects’ affection, he could rule only by fear; and to make himself feared as widely as possible he began the practice of trying capital causes without consultation and by his own sole authority” (Early History of Rome). He ruled as a tyrant rather than as a king, refusing to consult the Senate on any matters of military or state. His proto-Machiavellian foreign policy was just as brutal, as when he summoned a meeting of local leaders and proceeded to execute one (by drowning him to death, no less) under a manufactured charge, a blatant violation of Rome’s notions of justified foreign aggression. He used mercenaries for matters of war, a massive faux-pas in the Roman eye. One particular event recalls his military cruelty, the famous skirmish with Gabii (Ragan, Survey):
Unable to defeat the town of Gabii in battle, Tarquin contrived to have his son pretend that he was fleeing his cruel father — something easily believed. Established in Gabii, Sextus secretly sent to his father asking what to do next. While the messenger awaited, Tarquin silently went into his garden and with his walking stick lopped off the heads of flowers that towered above others. This “object lesson” was not lost on the son; many noble heads were lopped off, and Sextus gained power in Gabii only to hand it over to his father.
In religious matters Tarquin the Proud was equally inept. When the Cumaean Sibyl, a priestess of Apollo, came to Tarquin to offer him nine books of prophecy about the future of Rome (albeit for a hefty sum), he declined. The Sibyl, a crafty saleswoman (who knew!), burned three of the scrolls, and offered the six left for the original price. Tarquin yet again refused — and yet again the Sibyl set three alight, leaving only three from the original nine. Finally, Tarquin paid six thousand talents of silver — an exorbitant sum (about $99 million in today’s prices!) — for a third of the original offering. These books, which came to be known as the Sibylline Books, were housed in the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus and were consulted by the Roman Senate during national emergencies.
Despite its many disasters, the reign of Tarquin the Proud had one area of success: infrastructure. Tarquin, though deranged, understood the mind of the Roman populace; when kept busy, the people had little time to foment discontent. Accordingly, he imported Etruscan engineers and began several massive and lavish construction projects: the Temple of Jupiter and the excavation of the Cloaca Maxima, in particular. Ironically, however, it was the very area in which Tarquin found limited success that effected his downfall: His incredible infrastructure expenditure left the Roman coffers depleted and himself in need of more funds. And so he laid siege to the rich town of Ardea. I once again turn to Ragan for the downfall that followed (Survey):
The end of the Tarquins, and of monarchy at Rome, occurred with a tragic element. Away at a local siege [at Ardea], some young officers, including the king’s son, Sextus, his cousin Tarquinius Collatinus, and a friend, the (supposed) fool Lucius Junius Brutus (his name means “dull”), were one night discussing their wives. Whereas the other men bragged about their wives’ beauty and love of luxury, Collatinus spoke of his wife Lucretia’s great beauty, faithfulness, and diligence in keeping the house — at all hours. Finding this claim hard to imagine, the young men headed back to Rome late at night to find the situation exactly as Collatinus had asserted. Sextus was deeply struck with lust for the beautiful and noble woman. He later returned secretly with a sword to force her to lie with him. When at first she refused, preferring death to dishonor, he threatened further to kill her and leave a dead slave in bed with her. Rather than face public disgrace on herself and her family, the noble woman submitted to her shame. Some time later, overcome with remorse, she confessed the crime to her husband, Brutus, and others [including her father, Spurius Lucius Tricipitinus]. The horror related, she committed suicide in their presence. Aroused to mutiny by such an outrage, Brutus threw off the mask of foolishness he had cultivated to survive under a tyrant, and with many nobles, roused the senate and people against the Tarquins. The king was with the army; when he returned, demanding to be admitted to Rome, the gates were shut in his face, his property was confiscated, and the Tarquins were banished forever. Curiously, Sextus sought refuge in Gabii, where he met a just fate by the people he had betrayed. The exiled Tarquin sought the help of the Etruscan king Lars Porsenna to restore his throne. Failing in his attempt, Tarquin died in exile some ten years later.
And so the Roman Kingdom began and ended with rape: It initiated 241 years prior with the Rape of the Sabine Women, the famous snatching that furnished the hooligan hillpeople known as Romans with women, and it concluded with the famous Rape of Lucretia. Rome was now to be a Republic, ruled by two annually elected magistrates known as consuls.
Thus we conclude our fourth chapter of Roman history. The year is 509 BC, 244 years after her founding in 753, and Rome has entered a new era, the Republic, with two emergent leaders at her helm.

The problem is well-known enough to be a cliche: ancient history is exclusively focused on the lives and perspectives of aristocratic men. Sorting through this bias to recover the stories of other types of people — whether they be lower-class, enslaved, or in my case, female — is an inexact art. But allow me to try it for you. Here are 8 ancient Roman women you should know from history.
A word of caution before I begin: I am using Roman histories and literature here, not archaeological evidence or other ways we have of knowing about the Romans. That means I am filtering through the biases of aristocratic male writers. To the ancient Romans composing the histories, women could be roughly filtered into two categories: good women (wives and mothers who devote their entire beings to the benefit of the interests of their husbands, sons, fathers, etc.) and troublesome women (women who dare to become famous in their own right, and thus must have Something Wrong With Them). A troublesome woman was assumed to fit a certain stereotype: she was a conniving woman trying to use the powerful men in her life to her own ends; she did not observe the proper sexual boundaries (adultery, but also often incest); she killed men with poison (the woman’s murder method as it involved sneaking around and no face-to-face violence). Some of the women on this list will fit the Roman “good woman” mold, but most will be troublesome ones. So Roman writers — already notorious for their problematic relationship with facts — frequently reported rumors as fact or outright lied to make these women fit their stereotype better. Take everything you read about these women (including in this article!) with a healthy grain of salt.
It’s the middle of the second century BCE. New wealth has been pouring into Rome from its recent conquests, from Spain to Carthage to Greece, and tastes among aristocrats are shifting accordingly. The ruling class of Rome used to pride itself on austerity, dressing plainly and maintaining simple lifestyles. But an abundance of foreign gold has tempted the aristocracy into gaudy, Eastern-style displays of wealth. Fine fabrics, gold, and jewels are everywhere.
Cornelia, the daughter of Scipio Africanus (the general whose conquests helped generate all this wealth), is entertaining a friend at home. The friend has just been showing off her jewels to Cornelia, then asks, “What about you? Where are your jewels?”
Cornelia, who is dressed simply despite her wealth, summons her two young sons, Tiberius and Gaius. She smiles serenely as she displays her sons to her friend: “These are my jewels,” Cornelia says.
Cornelia was a paragon of virtue, an example to all Roman women of correct matronly behavior. She was well educated in both Latin and Greek. She was an accomplished writer: she published a set of her letters that were apparently widely read and studied by girls wishing to be as good as her. (These writings, unfortunately and predictably, are long lost.) She was devoted to her sons and remained faithful to her husband even after his early death: Cornelia was an univira, a woman who had had only one husband. She even turned down a marriage proposal from the king of Egypt. (Remarriage after widowhood or divorce was widely accepted and even encouraged, but the Romans reserved a special reverence for a woman who refused it — an univira showed a restraint and devotion to her deceased husband that surpassed even social expectations.)
As I mentioned, Cornelia was the daughter of Scipio Africanus, the vanquisher of Hannibal, who was undoubtably the most important Roman of his age and certainly one of the most consequential in all Roman history. But Cornelia raised her sons with a mission: she wanted them to be so successful that she would be remembered more as their mother than as Scipio’s daughter. This came true, but not in the way she wanted.
Cornelia’s sons, Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus, were Rome’s first populist reformers in centuries. Tiberius became a tribune of the plebs (the voice of the common people) at a time that the office had lost its radical edge. Tiberius brought populist rhetoric back after centuries of aristocratic dominance, demanding land reform to benefit the poor. The aristocracy did not take kindly to the proposition and murdered Tiberius Gracchus. A decade later, his brother Gaius came back with an expanded list of demands and an illegal private army to defend him from his brother’s fate. It took longer, but the aristocracy brought in the actual army and Gaius Gracchus took his own life once his defeat was certain. But the aristocracy could not silence the demands the Gracchi had stirred up. The Gracchi mark the beginning of an era of popular unrest and frequent uprisings, a period that ends with the aristocracy destroying the republic and establishing autocracy. They begin a violent epoch in Roman history that changes the very fabric of Rome.
If Cornelia had any aristocratic reservations about her sons’ political careers, we don’t know it: in public, Cornelia was an energetic supporter of her sons. Remember that, in the Roman view, a good woman supports the men of her family. By supporting her sons’ political ambitions even at the expense of her own social class, Cornelia again shows the Roman ideal of womanhood. Even her own ambition — to be more famous for her sons than for her father — shows the proper sort of ambition for a woman: desire not for her own elevation, but for the success of her menfolk.
Cornelia was both an old-fashioned scion of idealized Roman matronhood and an unusually learned and accomplished woman. She was highly respected in her own time and remains well remembered by history today.
It’s the first century BCE, and a more modern sort of woman is in vogue. The docta puella (“educated girl”) is more independent: she’s witty and worldly, she mingles with poets and philosophers as an equal, she takes lovers without shame. Men write about her love as a revelation, her rejection as the worst imaginable calamity. The docta puella holds a power that is most unladylike.
The foremost of the early doctae puellae was Clodia Metelli. She was a daughter of a heavily distinguished household who became infamous for a pair of affairs: one with a poet who damned her as eagerly as he had praised her, and one with a politician that ended in an accusation of poisoning.
Clodia was descended from one of the noblest families in all of Rome, the gens Claudia — among other famous ancestors was Appius Claudius Caecus, who built the first aqueduct and the most important Roman road, the Via Appia. (Most of the women of the family would have been named Claudia, but Clodia used an alternate spelling of the name that was briefly fashionable in her time.) She was married to Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer, an aristocratic optimate. But when her brother, the infamous populist rabble-rouser Clodius Pulcher, came into political conflict with Metellus Celer, Clodia publicly supported her brother over her husband. This might seem surprising, but though it was mildly scandalous, it was also seen as typical at the time: marriage ties were weaker than ties to natal families, and many Roman women supported brothers and fathers over their husbands.
We can’t know for sure, but we are pretty sure that Clodia was the lover of the poet Catullus whom he called “Lesbia” in his poems. His poetry is the only evidence we have of their relationship, and we can safely say that Catullus’s poetry prioritizes melodrama over factual accuracy. Still, the outlines of the relationship are clear: Catullus was a young upstart poet, Clodia an established, fashionable socialite. He followed her like a puppy, and she kept him around as long as he amused her, then discarded him in favor of other lovers. In a series of poems, Catullus bitterly attacks Clodia and the men he suspects of being her lovers until one begins to wonder what Clodia ever saw in him.
We are certain that Clodia had an affair with Marcus Caelius Rufus, an orator and up-and-coming politician younger than she was. Their relationship ended, and Caelius made his way firmly into political circles that opposed Clodia’s, so in 56 BCE Clodia accused Caelius of trying to poison her at the end of their relationship. Her motivation was political, to tank Caelius’s career and harm his allies — whether there was a grain of truth to the poisoning story is unknowable, but either way, her aim was political, not personal.
In the trial for the alleged poisoning, one of the members of Caelius’s defense team was Cicero, widely considered the greatest of all Roman orators and a longtime political opponent of Clodia’s brother Clodius Pulcher. Each member of the defense team had his own job, and Cicero’s was solely to shred Clodia’s credibility. This tactic would not be allowed in a modern courtroom, but in a Roman one it was fair game. Cicero would augment his colleagues’ claims of Caelius’s innocence with claims of Clodia’s debauchery and wickedness of spirit.
Cicero’s speech (called the Pro Caelio) is a masterwork of invective, and a catalog of Roman insecurities about women in general and doctae puellae in particular. He depicts Clodia as an amoral seducer of younger lovers who bought a house overlooking a bathing spot so she could pick out her victims. He accuses her of poisoning her husband and of having sex with her brother, two ridiculous charges that he knows he can’t prove, so he brings them up through backhanded hints instead of directly. He even assumes the persona of her famous ancestor Appius Claudius to tell her how disappointed he is in her and how she is tarnishing her family’s reputation. It’s a brutal, no-holds-barred takedown. Clodia loses the trial.
Yet we get the smallest hint that Clodia and Cicero didn’t take this political feud personally. In a letter from well after the trial, Cicero mentions speaking with Clodia about buying some land from her. It’s such an offhand, casual mention that it seems that they were on perfectly normal speaking terms. It certainly shows that both continued to move in the same social circles even after the trial. Maybe they were even friendly. It is this detail more than any other that suggests Clodia as an equal to the men of her time: that, just like men in politics, she was perfectly capable of having vitriolic public clashes with someone, then meet them later at a party and leave it behind.
In the end, Clodia was a socialite. She mingled with the men of Rome’s aristocracy as an equal, had affairs at will, involved herself in drama both personal and political, and remained part of her social circles regardless. She was a renowned beauty, an occasional political operator, and the very model of the docta puella.

Clodius Pulcher, like the Gracchi before him, was a populist rabblerouser. He’d risen to power by orchestrating huge amounts of mob violence and had a loyal group of supporters who were about to drive him to higher and better offices. Unfortunately, he has just been undone by the very force that created him: his gang and one led by a rival named Milo clashed in the road just outside Rome, and Clodius has been murdered. It’s 52 BCE, and Rome is at a crossroads.
Clodius’s supporters have brought his body to his widow, Fulvia, who cries publicly in her doorway. According to ritual and tradition, these should be her next steps: Fulvia needs to have the body cleaned and dressed, then leave it lying in the atrium so visitors can pay their respects before the funeral. Then in a few days, she must gather the family for a funeral procession through the city, which will include representations of Clodius’s famous ancestors (of which he has very many — see the description of his sister Clodia’s family above). The procession will stop at the Forum, where a distinguished male family member or friend will give a funeral oration in her husband’s honor. Then all will proceed to the family tomb outside the city walls, where the body will be cremated and placed in an urn inside the mausoleum. This is the procedure, and though it can be fraught with emotion, it is orderly and time-honored.
Fulvia does not do this.
She allows Clodius’s supporters to take his body, still broken and mangled by the street fight that killed him, directly to the Forum. There they lay him on the Rostra and give his impromptu funeral oration — mere hours after his death instead of days — in a way that whips the common people into a frenzy at the loss of their hero. The mob takes Clodius’s body and decides to cremate it on the spot, but by tradition all crematoria are outside the city walls. So they use the Senate house instead. The Curia Hostilia, the senate’s meeting place for at least 500 years, burns to the ground.
It is a horrifying parody of a Roman funeral. Fulvia at least allowed it to happen, and quite likely encouraged it — it was the role of a good Roman wife to enhance the legacy of her husband, and Fulvia was consistently a funhouse-mirror version of the good Roman wife.
In the aftermath of Clodius’s funeral, Milo goes on trial for his murder, and even a court stacked with his allies knows better than to acquit him in the face of such popular unrest. Cicero doesn’t even risk giving the defense speech he’s written for the occasion. The burning of the Senate house was a message no one could ignore, and the Senate takes immediate steps to bring back stability. The march toward a civil war that will destroy the republic continues — and this isn’t the last role Fulvia will play in it.
Fulvia was married three times, all of her husbands ill-fated. Her first, Clodius, was the most successful populist politician in all of Roman history, until he very much wasn’t. Her second, Curio, had been a close ally of Clodius during his life and inherited Clodius’s supporters. Curio, however, didn’t have the reformist spirit of Clodius — he threw in his lot with Julius Caesar, and died in Africa during Caesar’s civil war. We hear nothing about Fulvia in this period. It is Fulvia’s third husband who will throw her back into the public spotlight almost a decade after Clodius’s death — another partisan of Caesar named Mark Antony.
In the aftermath of Caesar’s murder, Antony is one of few men in a position to try to seize his supporters and become the next Caesar. The next decade is chaos, with alliances and rivalries shifting constantly. Antony’s most consequential sometime-ally-sometime-rival is Octavian, the great-nephew and official heir of Caesar. Octavian is much younger than Antony and has no military experience while Antony is a seasoned and respected general. But Octavian has something Antony never does: he is an incredible propagandist.
Fulvia first enters Octavian’s propaganda by way of Cicero, who attacks Antony in a blistering set of speeches called the Philippics during a period of hostility between Antony and Octavian. As Clodius’s old enemy, Cicero can’t resist also attacking Fulvia, wife of Antony and widow of Clodius. He calls her a deadly thing that has destroyed both her previous husbands and is about to destroy her third. He simultaneously questions Antony’s morality by bringing up his many affairs and paints Fulvia as a controlling woman whom Antony slavishly obeys.
Fulvia’s response to Cicero’s attacks is emblematic of the actions of a Roman politician’s wife. Since Antony is away in the East and unable to respond, Fulvia circulates the city with Antony’s mother, meeting with senators and solidifying alliances that would protect her husband. Wives were the original lobbyists — prominent Roman men relied on their wives to set up their social calendars in ways that would further their careers, and when they were out of the city, their wives were among their most important advocates. Some accounts have Fulvia falling at the feet of senators and weeping to convince them to spare her husband. She is successful.
Soon, the rift between Antony and Octavian is brushed away in favor of a renewed alliance — and a proscription list. Proscription is a method of sanctioning political murders; Antony and Octavian offer rewards for killing their political enemies, then use the resources of the dead to fund their war on the conspirators who killed Caesar. Since Cicero attacked Antony, he makes it onto Antony’s list, and Octavian does not object. Cicero is murdered while fleeing the city. Many wish to see Fulvia’s hand in this murder: she exacts delayed revenge on behalf of her first husband Clodius (who had been Cicero’s staunchest opponent), and on her own behalf after Cicero dragged her name through the muck. But Cicero was at least as much Antony’s enemy as he was Fulvia’s, and the Philippics had been much crueler to him than to her. Still, the legend goes that Fulvia took out her hairpins and stabbed the tongue on Cicero’s severed head.
As I mentioned, Antony spent much of this period in the East, while Octavian kept firm control of Rome in the West. Fulvia stayed in Rome, putting her (again) in the position of defending Antony’s interests in his absence — even as he infamously had very public affairs with a Cappadocian princess named Glaphyra, then with the Egyptian queen Cleopatra. Inevitably, Octavian turned against Antony again, and Antony dithered about his reply. But Fulvia felt no need to wait for him.
In 41 BCE, Fulvia allied with Antony’s brother, Lucius Antonius, to raise an army and oppose Octavian. She helped raise troops, an atypical role for a woman to play. But her involvement proved helpful to Octavian’s propaganda: he painted the rebellion as the work of Antony’s out-of-control wife, who was just jealous because her husband was sleeping with other women. He said Fulvia had strapped on a sword and armor and led troops herself (which she almost certainly did not do, to my everlasting disappointment, because I adore this image for all the same reasons Octavian hated it). It fit well with Cicero’s earlier characterization of Antony as weak and controlled by women, and would transfer well to Octavian’s later war against Antony and his lover Cleopatra. We still have to contend with Octavian’s exaggerated image of Fulvia when we consider her, because his messaging was very successful — it has made a larger impact on history than Fulvia herself ever did. Octavian’s soldiers even inscribed sling bullets with sexual insults aimed at Fulvia before lobbing them at her and Lucius’s troops — in the propaganda war, this battle was Octavian vs. Fulvia, not Octavian vs. Lucius Antonius or Antony himself.
Lucius Antonius and Fulvia lost their battle in the Italian town of Perusia. (The incident would be called the Perusine War after this town.) Mark Antony disavowed the entire incident, and Octavian viewed his shaky alliance as worth maintaining, so he exiled Lucius and Fulvia instead of having them executed. Fulvia went to Athens to reunite briefly with Antony, but she died of an illness not long afterward. She did not live to see Antony and Cleopatra become so close they might as well have been married, or their unsuccessful last stand in 31 BCE against Octavian, the future Emperor Augustus.
Fulvia’s legacy is complicated. She was certainly politically savvy and capable, but as much as she did not fear to flout convention, everything she did was in service of her husbands’ interests. Ultimately, there is much about her that is unknowable. Clodius and Antony were on the losing sides of their conflicts, so everything we know about her is filtered through a hostile lens; we can trust no surviving characterizations of her. This, I think, is one of Fulvia’s most fascinating aspects: we know what she did, but nothing about what she thought or how she was. Though she is often held up as the quintessential Roman troublesome woman, the real Fulvia is an enigma.
Hortensia was a female orator who spoke against a plan by the Second Triumvirate to tax noblewomen. We don’t know much about her aside from this one act, but she won great respect in oratory, a domain the Romans considered male-only.
Hortensia was the daughter of Quintus Hortensius, an illustrious orator and rival to Cicero. The backdrop for Hortensia’s speech was the civil war that destroyed the Republic, the same one that Fulvia participated in. After decades of fighting, the war chests were growing empty. Octavian, Mark Antony, and Lepidus, the Second Triumvirate, proscribed their political rivals to raise money through their wealth (the proscription list that killed Cicero), but even that wasn’t enough. So in 42 BCE, they came up with a plan to tax the 1,400 wealthiest women in Rome.
Laws targeting women in wartime had a history in Rome: during the Second Punic War two centuries earlier, huge defeats by Hannibal led to the Lex Oppia, which limited women’s wealth. The justification was that wealthy men had to contribute to war by fighting, so wealthy women had to pull their weight by paying. In the case of the Lex Oppia, there was also an unstated reason: anxiety over women holding the wealth of Roman society. The Roman aristocracy had been gutted by the disastrous victories of Hannibal of Carthage. For the first time, huge numbers of widows were inheriting their husbands’ estates. Roman moralists panicked, and the senate acted to “protect” the fortunes of the great families from capricious women.
In the case of the Triumvirate’s proposal, the motivation was political: just as in the Punic War, the wealthy women who would be taxed were widows. Most of the widows of the aristocracy were produced by their husbands’ deaths in the civil wars — thus, taxing widows was a way of draining their political enemies’ funds posthumously.
A group of noblewomen led by Hortensia appeared before the Triumvirate to argue the injustice of the proposed tax. No authentic account of her speech survives. The Greek historian Appian, writing a century later, presents a version of her speech produced by his own imagination — this speech includes the jarringly modern argument that women were being taxed for a war that they had no say in, because they could not vote or hold public office. In other words, an ancient Roman (Greek?) version of a suffrage argument, or perhaps no taxation without representation. What the real Hortensia said is a mystery, but we hear glowing reviews from various ancient writers who did have access to the text. She was said to have resurrected the oratorical greatness of her father.
The Triumvirate tried to usher the women off the speaker’s platform, but the crowd rebelled. In the end, they reduced the list of women to be taxed to 400 and looked for other sources of revenue. Hortensia’s speech was a partial success.
Hortensia’s story isn’t as extensive as some of the other women’s on this list, but she was certainly a woman who took ownership of an issue. She stepped out of the traditional woman’s role in Rome and into the spotlight of politics, however briefly — and unlike of the most women who did so, she won respect instead of condemnation.
Sulpicia is a true rarity: a female Roman poet. We know of a few poetesses from Roman times (one of whom, hilariously, is a Silver Age poet also named Sulpicia). But only the Sulpicia of the first century CE has a body of poems still in existence today. So what can our lone surviving female Roman poet tell us?
Sulpicia was a docta puella from a literary family: her grandfather was Servius Sulpicius Rufus, whom Cicero called the greatest orator he’d ever heard, and the uncle who raised her was the literary patron who launched the career of Ovid. It’s no surprise she became a writer. Her oeuvre is short, six poems totaling 40 lines together. Her complete collected works fit comfortably on one sheet of paper. They are elegiac poems, a Roman genre of passionate poems addressed to (usually fickle) lovers. She writes about a pseudonymous lover named Cerinthus — her love for him, and the pain caused by both of their missteps and by other people pulling them apart. She takes on the voice of an emotional teenage girl, pouting at her uncle as he plans an inconvenient family trip, cursing herself for missteps in communication with her lover, and wrestling with questions about her identity and place in society.
For centuries, Sulpicia’s poems were not recognized as hers. They were preserved in a manuscript of Tibullus and assumed to be his. Scholarship showed her authorship in the 1800s, but for the next century, she was regarded only as a curiosity. Scholars said her poems lacked refinement, that she was a passionate, emotional amateur who didn’t merit serious study. (Gee, I wonder if her gender had anything to do with these assessments.) Only in the 1970s did scholars start to take a closer look, strip away the prejudices of the past, and begin to appreciate the talent and erudition underlying Sulpicia’s poetry.
But even if those old-fashioned scholars had been right about her, Sulpicia would still offer us something no other Roman poet can. Much Roman ink was spilled writing about men chasing after doctae puellae, but in Sulpicia’s case, the docta puella herself speaks. She has much to say about identity and social respectability from a woman’s viewpoint. Although Sulpicia’s work is not extensive and does not touch on many of the subjects we would love to know about through her eyes, still, she is an authentic female Roman voice — one of very few we still have access to — and thus can help us make up for some of the bothersome blind spots in our study of the Roman experience.

Livia Drusilla was the wife of Augustus and first empress of Rome — it can be fairly said that she set the expectations for all empresses after her. She was a close advisor and confidant of the emperor and was thus heavily involved in politics. But unlike Fulvia, she kept herself rigidly within the acceptable social boundaries set for Roman women, so her public image during her lifetime was much more positive. After her death, however, it turns out that no amount of piety can satisfy the writers of history, because she gets accused of being a conniving murderer in equal measure with her more scandalous peers.
Livia was the third wife of Augustus (the former Octavian), but seems to have been the first one he married for love rather than alliance-building. They were both married to other people when they met, and Augustus was immediately smitten. He divorced his wife Scribonia on the same day she gave birth to their daughter, and compelled Livia’s husband, Tiberius Claudius Nero, to divorce her even though she was six months pregnant with their second child. Augustus and Livia married immediately, and Livia’s ex-husband gave her away at the wedding ceremony as if he were the father of the bride. This was in 38 BCE, after the future Augustus defeated Fulvia at Perusia but before he defeated Antony and Cleopatra.
Augustus and Livia then had a happy 51-year marriage. Livia was just as careful in presenting her public image as her husband always was: she was depicted consistently as a chaste, modest, religiously reverent matron. She never produced children for him (their only pregnancy ended in stillbirth), which many Roman men would have responded to with divorce. But Augustus’s affection for Livia never seemed to diminish. According to Suetonius, Augustus kept notes throughout the day of things he meant to tell her so he wouldn’t forget anything when he saw her (which is the hardest I have ever liked or related to that slimy bastard).
It is ironic that Livia never had children with Augustus, because Augustus passed a slate of morality laws to reward women for childbearing in an effort to improve the aristocratic birthrate. The era of Augustus is a time of re-traditionalizing after the time of the docta puella — adultery was criminalized, and women were granted certain civil rights as long as they had enough children. The Roman nobility pulled its wives and daughters back out of the public eye, and Augustus led the charge. His wife was presented as the ideal matron in public. The fact that she filled this role for him without giving him an heir is a testament that their love was real and important to him.
Still, Livia was accused by later historians of engineering the deaths of Augustus’s relatives — and even of poisoning Augustus himself — in order that her own son might become his heir. It is true that Augustus lost a lot of heirs before reluctantly adopting Livia’s son by her first husband, who became the second emperor, Tiberius. But modern historians reject the idea that this was Livia’s doing. It’s a bit of slander that doesn’t fit well with everything else we know about her, especially the fact that she was never as close to her son Tiberius as she was to her husband. If you’re looking for an empress willing to murder her husband for the advancement of her son, look further down the list — Livia’s not your girl, but Agrippina is on her way.
After Augustus’s death of natural causes (no poison needed), Livia retained enormous influence as Augusta, the widow of a god. She clashed with her son, who had no desire to share power with his mother. Even as her real influence dwindled, she enjoyed the ceremony and honor her status afforded her. She died in 29 CE, 15 years after her husband, and her son Tiberius vetoed the order Augustus had left behind that Livia be deified upon her death. 13 years later, her grandson, the fourth emperor Claudius, restored all her honors and made her a god, Diva Augusta.
The age of Augustus brought a re-traditionalizing of Roman womanhood after the age of the docta puella, and Livia Drusilla was the posterchild of the proper imperial matron. Her marriage is a rare case of a happy marriage in the imperial household, and she garnered enough public respect to be honored as a god after her death.
Agrippina was another empress, the wife of the fourth emperor Claudius and the mother of the fifth emperor Nero. Like Fulvia, Agrippina is depicted in ancient histories as a scheming woman intent on exercising power through powerful men — and unlike Fulvia, Agrippina seems to have deserved this reputation. Her story is a soap opera that involves the murder of her husband and her own murder by her son in some real Looney Tunes shenanigans.
Agrippina was a member of the Julio-Claudian family tree, which is impossibly full of cousin marriages and adoptions — she’s related to just about anyone you can name from this period. She was the daughter of Agrippina the Elder (the well-respected granddaughter of Augustus) and Germanicus (a beloved general who was Tiberius’s heir until his own untimely death). When Tiberius died in 37 CE, it was Agrippina’s brother Caligula who took over.
Caligula’s reign is infamous, as is his relationship with his three sisters — he was very close to them and heaped public honors on them. (Several ancient sources say that Caligula committed incest with his sisters, but this is just slander and not at all likely to be true.) The relationship soured when Caligula’s favorite sister, Drusilla, died. The other two sisters fell out of favor, and Agrippina became wrapped up in palace intrigue and possibly an assassination plot. She was forced to carry the ashes of her executed brother-in-law (an alleged co-conspirator) in his funeral procession, then was exiled from Rome.
After Caligula’s assassination a few years later, his uncle Claudius took the throne and invited his exiled relatives back. Claudius had a reputation as a weak man pushed around by freedmen and women, especially his wife, Messalina. After allegedly scheming to overthrow Claudius, Messalina was executed, and Claudius began to think about taking a new wife. He chose Agrippina (now a widow twice over with one son), possibly as a way to make peace between the feuding Julian and Claudian branches of the family. They had to get special permission from the senate to marry because Agrippina was Claudius’s niece — ick.
As empress, Agrippina exerted huge influence, pursuing and killing personal enemies and piling honors on herself and her son. She persuaded Claudius to adopt her son, who took the name Nero — bafflingly, this meant Claudius gave Nero precedence over his own son, Britannicus, who was a few years younger. But apparently Claudius began to get wise and to prepare to distance himself from Agrippina and Nero. So Agrippina enlisted the support of the palace poisoner, a woman named Locusta (“lobster”) — yes, the imperial palace was the sort of place to employ a poisoner. With Locusta’s help, Agrippina killed Claudius by poisoning his mushrooms at a feast. Her son Nero remained his heir.
When Nero took the throne in 54 CE, his mother Agrippina kept a tight leash on him. She put his praetorian commander Burrus and his tutor Seneca the Younger in charge and publicly honored herself as nearly a co-ruler. Nero began to rebel, so Agrippina signaled that she might start to favor Claudius’s son Britannicus as his replacement. In response, Nero poisoned Britannicus at dinner just as Agrippina had Claudius. Picture the scene: Britannicus takes a sip of his wine (Nero put the poison into the snow used to cool wine instead of the wine itself to evade the food tasters) and drops dead immediately (Locusta had advised a slow-acting poison, but Nero had insisted on a fast one that would be obvious). His mother and all his advisers know what he has just done, but Nero says that Britannicus is only having an epileptic fit and will soon recover. The household is forced to finish their dinner with the teenager’s corpse still at the table. Nero wanted to deliver a message to his mother, and he certainly succeeded.
A few years of rising tensions later, Nero threw Agrippina out of the imperial palace. As he prepared to escape from under the thumb of the advisors she’d assigned him and start ruling for himself, he decided he should kill her too. So he offered her the use of one of his boats for a pleasure cruise to the resort town of Baiae. He had the boat rigged to sink, and had a trick awning built that could be triggered to fall on his mother and weigh her down to the deck so she couldn’t escape the sinking ship. Like I said in the introduction — Looney Tunes shenanigans. But Agrippina is the Roadrunner in this scenario: she wrestled her way free of the awning and swam to shore. Nero decided the time for subtlety was over and simply sent soldiers to her house to murder her.
Agrippina was a cunning, ambitious woman with the same lack of scruples as the men in her family. She was the great-granddaughter, adopted granddaughter, sister, wife, and mother respectively of the five Julio-Claudian emperors. She murdered her husband with poisoned mushrooms only to be murdered in turn by the son she’d put on the throne — no one can say she didn’t know the game she was playing.
There are many empresses who came after Agrippina and similarly played political games as wives and mothers, most notably the many Julias of the Severan Dynasty — perhaps if I ever write a sequel to this article, I’ll cover them. For now, I’d like to take you forward a few centuries…
Honoria was an empress of sorts in the early 5th century CE, just before the fall of the western empire — and indeed there is an old-fashioned tradition of blaming her for the Fall of Rome itself. The Rome Honoria inhabited was very different from the Rome of all the other women on this list; one might even consider it an entirely separate society. But the woman who couldn’t follow a vow of chastity so hard she might have sent a marriage proposal to Attila the Hun about it certainly deserves a spot on this list.
Honoria was the daughter of short-lived emperor Constantius III and Galla Placidia, another woman who merits discussion. Placidia, the sister of emperor Honorius, was taken as a prisoner of war in the 410 CE sack of Rome by the Visigoths. When relations improved between the Goths and Honorius, the Gothic leader Ataulf married Placidia in 414 to cement a Romano-Gothic alliance. But relations soured again, and after her Gothic husband’s overthrow, Placidia returned to Rome as part of a peace treaty, where her brother married her off to a general who later became his co-emperor Constantius III.
Placidia had three children, including Honoria, who would have been a young child for much of what followed: Placidia’s husband Constantius III died, Placidia fell out with Emperor Honorius, and the family fled to Constantinople. A few short years later Honorius died, leaving a power vacuum in Rome, and Placidia and her children returned to join the dynastic struggle. In 425 CE, Placidia had her young son set up as the emperor Valententian III, and she became his regent, as no one expected a five-year-old to rule. Placidia held effective power as Augusta for the next 25 years.
Placidia gave the title Augusta to her daughter, presumably so she could help as regent if Placidia herself became unable for any reason. But centuries of dynastic struggle made late imperial households take some extreme measures: as Augusta, Honoria had to take a vow of chastity so that she wouldn’t produce any heirs to challenge the legitimacy of her emperor brother. She found this difficult when she matured, and became pregnant by a palace official. (Honoria’s chronology isn’t easy to pin down, but I think she was in her 20s or 30s at this point.) Her mother took away her title, executed her lover, and had her engaged to a middling senator with no ambition as a way of disarming her.
Stripped of power and prestige, Honoria chafed. She had been raised by a powerful imperial woman and expected the same life for herself. And so in 449 CE, Honoria sent a request for help — along with her engagement ring — to Attila the Hun. She offered him the western empire if he would extract her from her terrible engagement.
The infamous Attila had been threatening both halves of the Roman empire for some years now, but had not yet dared to make an all-out attack. Now he had received a plea and a ring from the sister of the western emperor — whether Honoria had actually meant her gesture as a marriage proposal is unclear, but Attila chose to interpret it that way, seizing on her request for help as a pretense to invade and a marriage alliance as a possible way to hang onto Rome once he took it. He announced his intention to march on Rome and claim his bride.
Emperor Valentinian III exiled his sister Honoria — only the influence of their mother Galla Placidia stopped him from executing her — and had to fight the Huns in Italy in the early 450s. But Attila never took Rome or claimed his Roman bride. Though he won all his battles in Italy, external forces pulled him east again, and he died shortly thereafter.
Nothing is known of Honoria’s life after this incident. There is some evidence to suggest that she was dead six years later, in 455, but we cannot be sure — she either died young or disappeared into obscurity.
Historians looking for a sensational story have sometimes pointed to Honoria inviting Attila the Hun to attack Rome as the cause of the final fall of the west, but the connection between those events is tenuous at best. That would imply that Attila was a primary cause of the fall, which is not a very solid argument. Attila, and by extension Honoria, merely contributed to the chaos swallowing the western empire at this time; they did not cause it.
Still, the story of an imperial woman so insulted at having been removed from power that she proposed an alliance (and possibly a marriage) with one of the most infamous so-called “barbarians” of all time to regain it… it’s a doozy, even if it didn’t actually destroy the empire. We can thank Honoria for one of the wildest, most soap-opera-like turns in late Roman history.
Socialites, schemers, pious wives, treacherous empresses — these eight women show a range of ways an upper-class woman could penetrate the male-centric bias of ancient historians and be recorded, however imperfectly, in their annals. My goal was to focus on Roman women who appear in the histories (with one sidebar into literature), which means this list is not intersectional: the lives of lower-class and slave women are more difficult to recover, though no less worthy of the effort.
These eight women represent a variety of ways in which women were received in their own time, from admiration to horror, from crediting them for making a difference to blaming them for the fall of society. A Roman woman was expected to support her family in public, but was routinely punished if she became too visible. The experience of being a woman was, perhaps, not as different from today as we might expect.
So tell me… which Roman women have I missed? Who should I cover in part 2?

“Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble Ancient footprints are everywhere You can almost think that you’re seein’ double On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs”- Bob Dylan, When I Paint My Masterpiece
How often do I think about the Roman Empire?
As a brown South Asian man, not much. I see the Roman Empire as a distant blip- a collection of bedtime stories featuring tales of valour, romance, betrayal, political intrigue, and war. However, when surrounded by the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, and the Colosseum, its hard not to think about the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire is inseparable from the life of the average present-day resident of Rome. The construction of the Rome Metro Line was repeatedly interrupted because every time they dug underground, they found Roman ruins. The average Italian’s regular Rome commute on the metro disobeys conventional underground train urban planning as it zigzags across the city to avoid running through Roman artifacts. The average Italian in Rome also disdains at the bumbling, clueless tourists who block the glorious Vespa’s right-of-way on the road. While the Roman Empire expanded outward from within like an amoeba conquering everything in its path, modern Rome is being conquered by tourists from without. And the reason for the tourist invasion? The gargantuan Roman artifacts that are interspersed with the average neighborhood in Rome. And of course, the food.
The word ‘romance’ comes from the old French word ‘romanz’ referring to the act of speaking in the old vernacular, more Latinized French. Romanz referred to a bygone era where Latin was the lingua franca during the Roman Empire. Stories written in the vernacular- or romanz- were action packed, chivalric, and medieval. Think Shrek, but less self-aware. These tales involved medieval knights setting off on Herculean adventures, slaying beasts, sparring with Barbarians, and winning a lucky maiden’s hand in marriage. These tales were a glimpse into the imagination of a person in the Middle Ages. It was a mythical adoration and idealization of a bygone Roman era which would be reminisced for centuries to come. The hero undertaking life threatening trials and tribulations to win the love of a beautiful maiden would- in this context- be romantic (i.e. imbued with the characteristics of a Roman). The ethos of Rome is giving Paris a serious run for its money in the title battle for The City of Love.
Another area where Rome gives Paris a run for its money is the food. We’ve all had a croissant- the flaky, soft package of buttery goodness that takes on a velvety texture when dipped in a cappuccino. The croissant is quintessentially French. Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite may well be the core values of the French Republic, but the word Croissant can be added to the end of that verbiage to include another aspect of what is core to being French. But what if I told you that there is a better alternative to the croissant- an alternative that we’ve all ignored over the last few centuries? Enter the cornetto, a larger, flakier, butter-ier, velvet-ier alternative to the croissant which comes filled with varieties of cream- usually, Pistachio, Chocolate or Custard. If you walk opposite to the direction of the teeming hoardes of tourists in Rome, you’ll come across local Pasticcerias- local pastry shops- selling cheap cornettos out of holes in walls. Italians line up around the block to collect their daily dose of cappuccino and cornetto right before their morning commute. The combination creates an essential fuel for today’s Roman, providing them with mental acuity and patience to tolerate bumbling tourists that block the roadways. One such hole-in-the-wall is the Roscioli Café Pasticceria- an iconic establishment that is always full, busy and teeming with Italians. One bite into Roscioli’s famous tent-pole pistachio cornetto expands the boundaries of what your mind thought was possible- the flaky, buttery, velvety soft texture of the cappuccino infused pastry is bombarded with the nutty, creamy, smooth, hearty textures of the pistachio crema. Now compare that with the croissant- a heap of flaky pastry that falls apart at the smallest touch. I will never see the croissant the same way again. The French have monopolized our consciousness and successfully convinced us of the superiority of their cuisine. Try one pistachio cornetto, and you’ll realize that a croissant is a middle-of-the-road bland husk of carbohydrates, or as the French like to say- merde.
Similar to the croissant, the pizza that you’ve been eating all your life is a lie. Pizza, once the pride of Italy, has been bastardized and appropriated by the Americans (as with all foods), and elevated to a sort of quintessentially American experience. The Pizza we eat today is what the American capitalist machine has forcefully shoved down our throats- a slab of chewy, overcooked dough, topped with excessively saucy and drippy tomaytuh sowuhss, complimented by an indistinguishable rapidly melting slop of mozzarella cheese made in a factory being operated by some poor bloke working minimum wage to mass produce a cheese purpose-built for the fastest melt rather than the best flavor. American pizza is not made with love, it’s made to suit the convenience of Americans- mass produced, characterless slop served quick and cheap, ready to reheat and eaten on the go in a Ford F-150. Italians take offense to the idea of New York Pizza. Even more offensive, are the Detroit Style and Chicago pizzas.
Romans have been consuming pizzas for centuries. Originated as a flat piece of dough topped with meat, vegetables and other accouterments during the Roman Empire, the pizza has mass appeal across cultures- take for example, the lahmacun in Turkey, the pide in the Levant, the mana’kish in the Gulf. The ancient recipe was simple- no frills, with no tomato sauce or melted cheese, providing for the best way for ancient Romans to gain energy on their long conquests, whilst maximizing flavor. Tomatoes eventually made their way into Italy in the 18th Century as a new world crop- “discovered” by Spanish conquistadors in their conquest of Latin America and brought back to Europe. And so began the tomato sauce fad. Look closely at regional pizza variations, and one will notice that pizzas in Naples almost entirely comprise a layer of tomato sauce on the dough. Meanwhile, Pizzas sold by decades old vendors in Rome include the original, sauce-less variations. While Naples does indisputably take credit for being the originator of the Pizza, there is an argument to be made that vendors in Rome remained true to the Pizza’s original tomato sauce-less form. One such Roman vendor is the famous Roscioli Antico Forno (different Roscioli this time).
Roscioli’s pizza, a very archetypal Roman kind- it’s flat, crispy, and served by the slice in rectangular form. Roscioli’s pizzas vary with the tomato sauce and non-sauce variations alike, producing variations that people travel across the world for. Their most popular pizza slice is the pizza bianca- or White Pizza. While the white pizzas sold at the large American chains usually replace tomato sauce with a regurgitated toxic sludge of a bechamel that fails to obey Newtonian fluid dynamics, Roscioli’s is without a sauce- leaving the white (or bianca) base exposed like a blank canvas ripe for culinary experimentation. Their dough- a treasured family secret- does all the heavy lifting. It’s crispy and flaky, whilst being flat with the right amount of give required for the perfect chew. Their variations include one that’s topped with potatoes, olive oil, salsiccia (Italian sausage) and rosemary creating a simple yet delicious slice that’s dripping with olive oil and can be eaten on-the-go. Another pizza variation famous in Rome, is the Pizza Marinara, reproduced best by another locally respected establishment- Pizza alla Palla.
Pizza alla Palla is tucked away into one of Rome’s back alleys within a quaint residential area. You will almost hear zero English spoken within a 500-metre radius of this establishment. It’s operating space is so tiny, that it can only fit 4 to 5 diners at once. The limited seating space is not a concern to their patrons, as the pizzas fly out from behind the counter in white paper bags to be quickly engorged on by a hungry Roman while they go on to conquer the Roman streets in their crusade against pedestrians and tourists. Pizza alla Palla’s pizzas- like most Roman pizza shops- lay behind a glass wall and are illuminated by bright yellow, fluorescent lights to contrast the bright reds of the sauce.
The Pizza Marinara, is a thought experiment on what Pizza would look like without cheese. While we’ve grown up eating cheesy pizza from American establishments our whole lives, the Romans have been eating Pizza without melted cheese for more than two centuries. Unlike with Roscioli, Pizza alla Palla’s pizza is carried by the sauce. My favourite variation on the marinara was a slice with anchovies, capers, olives and fresh burrata. The saltiness of the anchovies and olives when combined with the tartness of the capers and tomato sauce reinforce the hearty, fatty, and fresh burrata creating the ultimate flavour bomb that one can reminisce for years. If anchovies on pizza isn’t your cup of tea, then I suggest you go for local artisanal vendor Pizza Hut’s artful, hand-crafted, oven baked Pizza Margherita with a tomato sauce so generic that it may as well be copyrighted by Toronto based rapper Drake, accompanied by a cheese topping identical to a radioactive toxic sludge that makes Chernobyl look like a kiddie-pool.
Similar to Rome’s pizza, Rome’s pasta are quite unique and under-explored as well. The 4 pastas indigenous to Rome are: The Cacio E Pepe (Cheese and Pepper), Carbonara, Amatriciana and alla Gricia. What all these dishes have in common is the heavy-handed use of pepper to create nutty, mildly spicy notes to contrast with the fat of the cheese and guanciale (Pork jowl). Guanciale- a slab of fatty pork meat- is heavily used in the Carbonara, Amatriciana and alla Gricia and its fat often serves as a starting base for the sauces. Carbonara adds egg to this fat, Amatriciana adds tomato sauce and alla Gricia adds cheese, creating a holy trinity of Roman fat-based pasta sauces. The most common of these outside of Italy is the Carbonara, almost universally bastardized through the extra addition of cream, bacon and emulsifying agents. The universalization of American Italian food through mass production and the prevalence of American cultural exports everywhere has forced us to accept mediocre dishes as the standard. These dishes use old, chewy bacon instead of guanciale; salty, starchy, powdery parmesan with a texture similar to a social lubricant ubiquitous on Wall Street; store brought dried, chewy pasta as a vehicle for the sauce; and most importantly, xanthan gum to lend the pasta cohesion in order to hide the underpaid, overworked chef’s lack of skill in emulsifying pasta sauces.
Do yourself a favour and seek out a local Italian establishment- one that uses guanciale in the carbonara- and taste the difference between an actual carbonara and what you’ve assumed is a carbonara for your entire life. As one famous quote goes, “mediocrity is a sin”- or as I transliterate it to “never settle for a pasta that uses shit ingredients”. Local pasta in Rome is cheap, fresh, and even healthy given the average 10k steps-a-day mileage for the average commuter. To find the best, bang-for-buck establishments frequented by local patrons, ask the cab drivers for where they would eat. Or even go in the opposite direction to the tourist hivemind, and maybe then you’ll actually experience some local culture.
Walk down any Roman street, and you’ll find small, quaint trattorias selling suppli- a gooey, cheesy ball of leftover risotto or pasta that is doused in egg, coated with breadcrumbs and deep fried. You’ll find this everywhere in Rome. But it is often overlooked by small-minded tourists who conceptualize Italian food as pizza and pasta. Supplis (not to be confused with the Southern Arancini) are a small snack that are a cultural equivalent of a samosa- eaten either as an appetizer or between meals to satiate one’s appetite. Suppli can be quite intoxicating, addictive and pair well with local beer creating the ideal bitter and salty-savoury combination that hits the right spot at 2 am on a Thursday night.
We think we know Italian food. But we don’t. There are so many cultural variations and dishes that we’ve never tried, and that we’ll probably never try. Most of these dishes never make it out of Italy because Americans haven’t yet found an efficient way to ruin them yet. To go to Italy, and look for an Alfredo with grilled chicken on menus while committing the cardinal sin of asking the waiter for chilli flakes to spice your pasta is a disservice to the centuries old Italian culture that has tried, tested and perfected their foods. If you’ve ordered chilli flakes or chilli oil (as most Indians I know) at an Italian restaurant, you probably don’t deserve to go to Italy. Respect the local culture, appreciate it for what it is, and please, do NOT make the whole table wait while you immaculately position the dishes for your Instagram story. Not only are you upsetting everyone at the table, you’re also upsetting the Italians. Their dishes don’t need your Instagram story to popularize them. They’ve already refined their cuisine over centuries of experimentation.
My short, 36-hour Rome stay was eventful- I explored virtually all of Rome on foot, resorting to public transport only when necessary. I’ve tried everything Rome has on platter- the gelatos, the Pizzas, the Suppli, the Pastas, the coffee, the pistachio cornetto. But there is still a lot left to see- Italy is not just Rome, Venice or Milan. Italy is Sicily, Naples, Emilia-Romagna, Calibria, Lombardy, Tuscany, and so much more. To say, that I know Italian food is an injustice to Italy. I, on the other hand, can affirm that I know Rome, and I hope that perhaps one day, I will know Italy.
There is a saying in Rome: “The Milanese eat to live. Us Romans, on the other hand, live to eat.” The Roman experience is derived from the food. And perhaps, there is no Rome without its food- so the Roman Empire hasn’t completely died out. Its legacy lives on through its flavours, ingredients and culinary pastiches. The Roman sculptures look on as the centuries pass by. Empires come and go, and with it, the foreigners that visit Rome to witness the greatest city ever built. Neighborhoods, metro-lines, bus routes and office buildings are continuously built and destroyed on top of the ruins of an ancient, great civilization. Rome has always been in a churn of creative destruction. And all that remains- and all that will ever remain- is the food, sculptures and the Roman sun.

One of my clients, Chad Fuentes, recently said something that stayed with me:
“I feel like sometimes we romanticize the past and put undue praise on characters or people from that past, while holding the people supporting us in the present to an unfair standard.”
Yes. There’s truth in that.
I had been reflecting on something similar while watching a speech from one of our national leaders — perhaps the President addressing Congress or the Senate. I can’t recall the exact details, but the image was clear: the structure, the solemnity, the way history lives and breathes through these halls. And I found myself thinking, There it is. Rome. Different time, different clothes, same posture.
This isn’t cynicism — it’s recognition.
We, the people, love to imagine that we’ve evolved. That our systems, our sophistication, our technology have moved us forward. But have we? Strip away the gold and the marble, and we are often still functioning from the same roots. The same hunger for power. The same imbalance. The same blindness to the living beauty beside and within each of us.

“Mille viae ducunt homines per saecula Romam” — Alain de Lille, Liber Parabolarum
The phrase “All roads lead to Rome” is a proverb that originated from the ancient Roman Empire, reflecting the city’s central importance as a hub of trade, culture, and power.
In a broader sense, it means that there are many different paths or approaches to reach a particular goal or destination. For single mothers in Indonesia, this proverb holds a significant meaning. It represents the understanding that they often face numerous challenges and obstacles in providing for their children and ensuring their well-being. Even when it seems like there are no viable options, single mothers need to be resilient and resourceful, creating new paths to navigate and overcome the difficulties they encounter.
Their children cannot wait for a clear path to access their basic needs, such as food, shelter, and education. It is the responsibility of single mothers to provide these necessities, even if it means forging new paths and finding alternative sources of income. Single mothers cannot rely on their children’s fathers to fulfill their financial ‘obligations’ and give child support, so they must continue to strive for self-sufficiency and sustainability.
I cannot imagine the struggle faced by single mothers without the privileges of higher education, extensive networks, or even personal branding like mine. With a relatively high level of education, the privilege to live in the capital city, and a strong personal brand, I am currently feeling almost desperate in my search for a path to my own version of Rome. I can only imagine the challenges faced by other women who may still be recovering from the abandonment of their former husbands, having been allowed to be only housewives for years and financially dependent on them. My heart goes out to them, and I hope they are always empowered to find their own paths to Rome, their own versions of success.
For me personally, I am still navigating a path that hopefully leads to my version of Rome. I am still somewhat afraid because this time the road is dark and full of obstacles. I am still terrified because I often feel powerless, considering my age and the fact that I have a son who is still fully dependent on me. They say there are many roads to Rome, and I personally believe that. There are many ways to generate income without having to work in an office. However, not everyone can or wants to take those paths.
Some may not be able to see the options in front of them because to them, it’s too dark and eerie, for some others, they would rather close their eyes in fear of the uncertainties. If you currently feel unable to navigate these paths and want to give up, take a break, I feel you. Once you have regained some of your strength, you can continue. If you are currently closing your eyes out of fear, it’s okay to be scared. Give yourself time to muster up the courage and give yourself a chance to see what choices you have.
The important thing is not to give up. Hang in there. If you experience various rejections, it does not mean you have failed. It could be that you are being protected from a much worse condition or being redirected towards a better path to your own version of Rome.
One day, I hope you will look back and see your today as an adventure and valuable experience that you can remember with joy in your hearts. Until then, just hang in there.
I love yous!

Disclaimer: I got a little wild in this article, hide the kids.
History has a tendency to leave out very obvious same-sex relationships. We have all heard of the astute gentleman who lived with his lifelong platonic male friend in a house with one bed. You may not have heard that Hadrian was so head over heels for his lover Antinous that he declared him a god upon Antinous’s death.
I’m sure your partner is kind to you, but have they ever made you a fucking god?
The term homosexuality did not exist in the language of the Romans. So when discussing same-sex relationships in the empire, we have to do so through a lens we may not initially understand. This article will explore how Romans saw sex in general with a few notable examples.
We can only go off historical accounts, artifacts, and writings of the time when discussing civilizations as old as Rome. So while these views might be the majority opinion, there were likely severe deviations in mindset on a one-to-one level.
There was almost certainly an old bitter roman telling younger generations to pull their damn togas up.
We define homosexuality as a relationship between two people of the same gender. Romans defined sex through power and status, which means that as long as you were the dominant party, your reputation was unaffected.
To put it gently, it was admirable to be the sword and pitiful to be the sheath. Didn’t really expect to be conjuring up historical metaphors for anal sex when I woke up today, but here we are.
This could be seen at the highest level of roman society. Nero enjoyed the casual midweek orgy with men and women and did just about everything you can sexually do throughout his life. This includes dressing as an animal and attacking the genitals of tied-up men and women.
The emperor was batshit crazy, but you can’t knock his creativity. He also had sex with his mother. This fun fact isn’t relevant to the article — but I’m telling you anyway.
Nero had a young eunuch boy as his wife named Sporus, who was supposedly the spitting image of his late wife. This speaks to the more common pederasty of the time, but we won’t be getting into that here. I don’t discuss pedophilia before noon, as a rule. This marriage was peculiar but did not hurt the esteem of the emperor; it simply hinted at his mental instability.
It wasn’t until he took the former slave Pythagoras as a husband that everyone started giving a bit of side-eye. This was made worse by the fact that they had sex in front of their wedding guests. This resentment by the onlookers was not because Romans had disdain for same-sex relations. It was because their emperor was the “woman” in the relationship.
This leads me to an important point, Rome was plainly misogynistic. So even though it might seem like Rome was a sexually liberated place for its time, things were far less equal when it came to women. In fact, many considered lesbian relationships an unthinkable transgression.
This did not mean people of the time did not talk about it. A notable myth is that of Iphis, who was a girl raised as a boy. She falls in love with her appointed wife and is turned into a man by Isis. There is also the fictional story of Megilla, who changed her name and wore a wig to marry a Demonassa.
Several people, including Ovid, said women being sexually active exclusively with other women was an exceedingly rare occurrence.
What is more likely is that women were far less open about it than unquestionably powerful men like Nero, Hadrian, and Elagabalus. This is reinforced by the fact that it was seen largely as very socially unacceptable. Sadly, when lesbian relationships were discussed, it was typically with a tone of shame and disapproval.
This might have been due to how Rome perceived women and sex in general. For a woman to sleep with another woman meant that there would be a dominant partner. This was seen as masculine and looked down upon by the people of the time.
Women had an incredibly restrictive life in Rome. This speaks to the intelligence of the many that did manage to rise to power, as it was a very dangerous path to walk for those not born a man. I’ll cover that more when I get into Agrippina the younger, who was a fascinating figure and Nero’s mother.
Y’know, the one he slept with.
We can draw a lot of parallels from Rome, though their society was quite a bit different than it appears on the surface. It should also be said that several of the sexual liberties given to people were reserved for the higher parts of society, with lower social classes being allowed much less personal freedom.
Stay tuned for a more in-depth look at Elagabalus, who is a fascinating character and one of the first transgender people recorded in history.
I’ll drink less coffee next time.
Thanks,
Jack

I always wanted to go visit Rome and Tuscany, but for a while viewed them as two separate trips. But then I thought to myself, why not combine them? I had only seven days to spend in Italy, so it was a challenge.
Would the memories from traveling to Rome overshadow Tuscany? Would I be able to manage logistics and stay within my budget?
Looking back, I think it was a great idea. And now, in the winter of 2023, if someone had asked me what impressed me the most, I would say:
in Rome — Colosseum and in Tuscany — Pitigliano.
Rome Colosseum
I went inside, closed my eyes, and imagined what it was like to live in Rome 2000 years ago when on average 80000 people were watching fights lasting days at the time. Brutal fights, where gladiators were fighting with each other and with wild animals. Where spectators were deciding who lived and who died in the arena below.
The spectators in the Colosseum had separate seats with men being separated from women.
Romans did not have any problems with killing each other just for fun and regularly attending brothels…

When in Rome, See This Treasure:
Saint Cecilia in Trastevere: Patron Saint of Singers, Composers, and Musicians
A quiet Trastevere via opens to a large landscaped courtyard, which fronts this Basilica that was built over the home where Cecilia lived and died.
The courtyard is a lovely neighborhood playground — where you’re bound to see mammas circling strollers around the central Roman urn and nuns chatting away after mass.
In third century Rome, Cecilia was known as the girl who heard angelic harmonies — she could play any instrument or sing any song. She secretly swore to be a chaste Christian, but went through with a marriage her parents arranged anyway. On the wedding night, she broke the news to her husband Valerian, telling him the only way he could touch her was to become a Christian, so he ran off to get baptized. When he returned, he found their bridal chamber transformed — full of flowers and Cecilia wearing a crown of lilies and roses. This miracle swept Valerian into the faith. He made it his mission to help the poor and bury Christian martyrs, and was beheaded for his belief.
Then Cecilia was tortured for her faith, forced into a tub of boiling water in her own bathtub. She sang all…

I want to talk about a recent trend in mobile gaming. It’s the trend of desktop/console games getting re-imagined and made into mobile games. We’ve had all sorts; from League of Legends Wild Rift, to Call of Duty Mobile and even Nintendo getting in on the action with Mario Kart.
These games are not typically straight remasters. They are often altered versions of the original experience.
This means I have been left disappointed on several occasions as I download a game from a beloved franchise expecting the same high quality experience I’m used to on console. Only to get something very different.
Typically I have found it goes one of 2 ways with these console/desktop titles reappearing on mobile:
This is a game I loved as a child and when I realised it had got a mobile re-release I tentatively downloaded it expecting another second rate experience. O boy was I wrong, it’s brilliant!
Rome Total War is a strategy game with 2 types of game play:
So it’s not the simplest game out there. There is a lot of depth and freedom in what you can do in both the campaigns and the battles themselves. Given this, it may seem remarkable that this translates so well to mobile.
Google maps is a fantastic product, and one of the reasons for this is that it’s intuitive to use both on your phone and desktop. It is so easy to explore the world with Google Maps. Whether pinching or scrolling to zoom, clicking or tapping, there is no friction to navigation. Neither mobile nor desktop feel like imitators of the other.
Whether intentional or not, Total War has achieved the same thing with its map navigation. Creating what feels like a completely seamless experience on mobile when navigating the map, even when compared to the old desktop experience. This is hugely important as a large part of this game is about navigating 2D or 3D environments in order to make strategic decisions. It sounds so simple but getting this navigation right, to me is the cornerstone of what makes Rome such a good port.
Alongside the map navigation exploring the UI and interacting with map elements is also incredibly frictionless. With certain button sizes scaled up and freedom in how you scale the HUD I never once felt limited using a touch screen over a mouse and keyboard.
Now this is going to sound overly simplified but here it is. Rome Total War on mobile is such a great game because it is exactly the same as Rome Total War on desktop, and that was a great game.
As far as I can tell nothing is missing from the mobile version versus the desktop game. This means the same incredibly deep campaign experience is available in your pocket.
With too many mobile ports you see simplification or compromises made on the original experience. Which as mentioned before can leave you feeling unsatisfied. Rome Total War does not compromise and that is great.
The best part of Rome Total War is the campaigns. When I played Total War as a child I would play for hours on end, working my way through campaigns one turn at a time. Now if I have hours to play games typically I won’t be on my phone.
However I feel like this port has got me playing just as much as I did as a child, but in a very different way.
You see because the campaigns are turn based this means they are filled with natural pauses. Each turn still takes me 5–10 minutes but this time the game lives in my pocket. Meaning Rome Total War through this brilliant port has shifted from an experience I would settle into on a Sunday afternoon to something I can pick up here and there throughout the week.
So basically I loved Rome Total War as a kid, and now I’ve fallen in love with it again.
The controls are so intuitive you would have thought the game was made for touch screens and the experience is not comprised at all when compared to the desktop version. On top of that the game being on my phone allows for a new style of play. Giving me little bursts of nostalgia throughout my week.
Overall I think Rome Total War is great example of how you can re-release old titles on mobile and breathe new life into them.

In the 2000 years since Roman Emperor Septimius Severus’s reign, many don’t seem to know he was an African man with brown skin. And when I say brown skin, I don’t mean he was a little tan. According to a family portrait painted during his lifetime, Emperor Severus’s skin was an even richer shade of brown:
We’ll talk about why this matters in a moment. But first, please also take a look at Daniel Voshart’s photoreal portrait of all the Roman emperors in which Emperor Severus is featured on the third row in the third image from the left here:
voshart.medium.com
Kinda brown, huh?
The full richness of Severus’s melanin is not prominent in the light colored marble statue of him which was found in Egypt and created somewhere between 193–200 A.D. Held at The British Museum, the statue does depict Severus’s hair and beard as being quite curly. Several coins bearing his image also feature him with curly hair.

I feel like I should be documenting this somewhere. Partially because it feels too good to be true, and the other part, well — believes that everyone should know what everlasting happiness is. Even if it’s just for a moment.
I just moved to a new City. And it’s a godsend. The people here look like me. They speak both my native languages, and they welcome me with their culture. Their hugs. The microcosms in their face, they express gratitude for our shared experience.
The food enriches my being in a way I have not felt in some time. Not all of it tastes like home, but that’s what makes it so familiar. Deeply nourishing to the Ori.
And then.. there’s him. I met an artist. Full of love, of life. Of pain. And also, of beauty. Everything he’s been through shows nowhere on his being. His hands are soft, like a pianist. His callouses showcase strength, fight, only present because life unfortunately placed them there. But he still smiles. He still laughs. And enjoys the little things that life has to offer him.
He’s passionate. As both a lover and a being. He’s armorous. Unshielded for selected few. Olodumare blessed me with an opportunity to see him bare. And his soul — it lights me entirely. His rage and anger, they’re subtle and fleeting. His eyes, a golden honey. His lips, kisses wet enough to quench a thirst I never knew was lingering.
I believe that God gave me the strength and carried me through, just to bring me right here. To know a warmth so pure, so true. And know how to cherish it when it arrived at my doorstep.
And I swear on everything that I know, I would go through it all over again just to meet him once more — in this moment. Right here. Right now.
I’ve always wanted to go to Rome. Since I was a child. Little did I know that the city would offer more than pasta and parmigiano. It would be the thing that brought colors of me back to the canvas. And ultimately, a subconscious iridescence back to life.

Feature by Katie McKnoulty
Now one of Europe’s up-and-coming voices in food, Saghar works with leading editorial and commercial clients; runs cooking workshops across Italy; and has previously contributed to Italy’s national newspaper, Corriere della Sera. Her debut cookbook, Pomegranates & Artichokes, aims to show our innate similarities as humans by tracking recipes on her journey from Iran to Italy. We couldn’t wait to discover Saghar’s Travel Playbook of recommendations to experience when in Rome.
When I was born, we were not only in full Islamic regime, but we were in the middle of a war with Iraq which went from ’80 to ’88. It was very traumatic because I was literally born under bombs. My earliest memories are of the sirens that went off in Tehran that announced the bombings, and we used to put big chunks of tape on the windows so that if they broke, they wouldn’t break into our homes. We would go away for short periods of time when the bombings were very intense, to other cities. I remember very well that they had bombed maybe a few blocks away from our house, and I remember that the curtain of my room had been ripped apart by glass.
From a very early age, the first thing we learned is that your life at home is a very different life from your life outdoors. So indoors, everything is normal — you have parties, your family comes, you put on music. And then we would go to school, and we would have to wear the veil and everything. And your parents would tell you, ‘You shouldn’t say to anyone that we were dancing at home yesterday’ or ‘You should never, ever say that daddy had a drink, because all of that is illegal, OK?’. You don’t know who to trust, and then eventually you learn that almost all of the kids going to your school are living in a similar situation.
At the university where I studied art and architecture in Tehran, we had a very rigid education about composition and light. I struggled a lot in university in Iran to understand things and find my own visual language. Art especially wasn’t my thing, but my mathematical brain understood composition very well. Then, in Rome, I studied graphic design and design general. And eventually, I moved towards photography and food because I became really passionate about it.
I didn’t know anything about Rome. I chose Rome mainly because it was the Italian capital and in my silly, 20-year-old head, the capital is the place to go. This is what I thought. But when I arrived here, despite the difficulties that it has, I really fell in love with it. For those of us coming from countries like Iran, as students, the experience of arriving in Italy is very, very different from that sort of Under the Tuscan Sun experience. We live in a different dimension: when we arrive here, our goal is survival and we don’t have any funds or anything. And we still need to find a job, and we need to do all of these things in Italian. I went through hell because I was really scared of not being able to make it and having to go back to Iran. Even to this day, whenever I go somewhere and I come back here, I’m happy to come back to Rome. It grabs you and never lets go of you.
Rome is a ridiculously beautiful city. I think that’s very important to me. There are certain aesthetic things — like the trees, Roman pines that are like umbrellas, against the backdrop of the ochre and orange buildings. And the blue sky of Rome is something special. It struck me very, very hard in the beginning. And it still does. And then of course it’s historical; it’s charming; it’s got all of those classic grand things that are very beautiful. They give me joy, as frivolous as it may sound.
I live somewhere between the Colosseum and a neighborhood called Esquilino. And over the years it was not known as a very nice place, but now it’s becoming very nice and lovely — I think there’s been a bit of gentrification. It has a very, very long street called Via Merulana that leads to the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore; one of Rome’s biggest treasures. They have extraordinary medieval mosaics there — absolutely stunning. I love that church a lot. And then, in terms of museums, Palazzo Massimo and Palazzo Altemps are some of the most beautiful things that you can see — not just in Rome, but in Italy, possibly in the world. Often my suggestion to people who can’t get Vatican tickets or who don’t want to queue for three-and-a-half hours under the burning sun, is to get a combo ticket. It lasts for two days and you can see all of them, including the Vatican. It’s mind-blowing, absolutely mind-blowing.
In the side streets of the Via Merulana, there are a couple of nice places. One of them is a new bakery — Forno Conti. They have bread of course, but also croissants and cakes, and it’s become very popular. There’s a little community around it. It’s very different from the classic Roman bakery. Then there’s a little wine bar that’s quite famous now in Trastevere called Enoteca l’Antidoto, and they have very nice natural wines and littles dishes. There’s another trattoria called Trattoria Pennestri. The food is Roman but with an elegant little twist. You need to book but it’s not impossible to get in.
I do a lot of shopping at Esquilino Market. To be honest, the quality of fruit and veg is not always, like, a farmers market, but it’s possibly the most multicultural market in Rome. And you can find a lot of ingredients that you can’t find anywhere else. The African community shops there; the Chinese community shops there; the Bangladeshi and Indian community shops there. So it’s very interesting.
After university I discovered food blogs. Some of them were people who were very much like me — they had a background in the arts and now they were working with food. Some of them were doing astonishing photography, and that was the moment that it clicked. And I thought, ‘I can do this’ — not so much because I knew how to do photography, because I didn’t, but because I knew composition and I knew light. So I started practicing. It took me some time but it was also very nice, because for the first time I had found my visual language — the thing that I had struggled so much to find. It was very liberating.
The more I worked with food, the more I was intrigued with its cultural and political aspects and what it represents. So I started blogging about it and writing about it. And this is how I came to write my first cookbook, Pomegranates & Artichokes, which is exactly about those things. It’s also autobiographical, and this is what I do: I love to look at cultures, habits and situations through the lens of food, literally and figuratively.
Pomegranates & Artichokes is a cookbook that starts in Iran; then it travels west, crossing the Mediterranean and the Middle East through Turkey, Greece, Lebanon and Syria, all of those countries. And it arrives in Italy as if you were taking a flight — it literally does this journey. I love watching the map thing on the airplane and this is exactly that. I got this idea because this is a book that is born out of my experience of living as an Iranian, but mostly as an immigrant, here in Italy, in the West. This whole book is about how a lot of the flavors, ingredients and cooking methods are super similar. We’re not even that far, geographically speaking. Basically, you cross Greece and Turkey, and you’re in Iran — so how is it that people from my side of the world are treated so differently where our food is so similar? So this book is a testimony to those similarities.
It started because of the protests of the death of Mahsa Amini, who was murdered because she was showing a few strands of hair. So it is about compulsory hijab, and yet it is not just about compulsory hijab. There are many rights that women in Iran don’t have: the testimony of a woman in court is worth half of a man’s; women can work but if your husband says you cannot work then you cannot work; you can’t have rights to the custody of your child if you get divorced; and you can’t ask for a divorce — the right to divorce lies with the husband. What’s happening to the women in Iran concerns us all. And the fight against the Iranian regime is the fight to be on the right side of history.
Always window. I like to have space to lean out and look out of the window. But it’s mostly the leaning thing.
‘Via da Roma’ by Luca Barbarossa, from the album Roma è de tutti. The name says it all. It’s very nice.
Contradictory.
There are a lot of beautiful things and lots of ugly things. Like all big cities.

After a long silence (because reasons), I return to Medium (as intended a while ago!) I actually have several unfinished stories, some that are in old school notebooks and others just existing as a draft in title. So content is in abundance and hopefully I’ll be able to share more and more consistently in the coming weeks. I even acquired a tablet, with one of the main motives being more writing. In fact, my return article is related: I’ll write about a game I’ve been playing on the tablet. So without further ado, let’s talk Grow Empire: Rome!
As an avid Starcraft UMS and Warcraft 3 custom map player, I’m always on the lookout for tower defense maps on mobile. My recent search brought me to Grow Empire Rome. The name was familiar, but I hadn’t give it much thought at first. The reason it was familiar was because of a game I played on my phone before: Grow Castle and I would indeed notice the gameplay parallels quite soon into the game. They aren’t developed by same people from what it seems and indeed there seems to be a major difference between the games. Okay, enough with the fluff and meta, let me talk about the game!
Grow Empire Rome, GER from now on, is a defense game, rather than a traditional TD. As you might imagine, it has a Roman Empire setting. You have a base where barbarians attack, wave by wave, each wave triggered by you. So you don’t start a game and play 10 waves. You play one wave and it’s over. You can start the next one if you like. On top of that, there is an empire map and you can launch invasions on enemy colonies to acquire them, which sort of reverses the roles. Each acquired colony then has 3 waves of rebels you can fight whenever you wish. I haven’t bested the 3rd level yet, but I’m guessing that’s it.
You gain gold from kills in each wave (meaning you get some even if you fail the defense) plus some amount from your colonies. This amount can be increased by upgrading the colonies by investing in some gold. You even generate some of this gold when you are not playing. You will also get the option to watch an ad to get some gold now and then. Gold is used for upgrading your walls, archers, towers and units. The upgrades will occasionally have visual affects too. Units will look better every 4 upgrades and your flimsy fences will turn into actual walls with archers and towers in time.
The other currency, crystals, is acquired after every 10 levels or so, plus by defeating the rebellions in colonies. Crystals are used to buy and upgrade heroes, a type of unit that brings a passive bonus to your army as well as fighting actively on the front line. You also use crystals to upgrade your bank, which in turn improves your gold gain from colonies when you aren’t playing the game. You can also buy card packs with crystals. These you can use when invading colonies to provide you bonuses. Finally, you can buy mercenaries, which are extra troops you can use in invasions. As you might imagine, you can buy crystals and farming them takes some time (but not too terrible to unlock the most expensive hero to be honest.)
Finally, you gain experience from battles. This is earned by the General, which is basically you. You can level up and distribute skill points to unlock passive and active skills. I’m not sure if there are ceilings for these bonuses. I believe the cost to increase a skill also increases in time. I have leveled one to 20 and so far haven’t seen it though.
Each wave is basically a bunch of enemies rushing at your walls, fighting any troops they may encounter on the way. Your archers and towers will attack any enemies in their range but your main fighting force will be the reinforcements you summon. There are several unit types that will attack you and you will use to defend, sort of in a Rock Paper Scissors setup.
Speaking of unit types, there are 4+1+1 in total. 4 are the core units that you can use anywhere: Infantry, anti-cavalry infantry, ranged and cavalry. Then there is the siege unit, which is a battering ram that resembles Age of Empires variants. This is only used by the sieging party, not the defenders. Finally there is the elephant. From what I see this is only for the computer. Oh, and the heroes I mentioned above. I only saw them for our side and I imagine computer do not have them.
Normal waves will only spawn two types of units, one group after the other e.g one ranged, then one infantry, then another ranged… until the whole wave is cleared. You will have two charges of reinforcements at the start and you can use any of the 4 types, you don’t need to choose a layout. This will come handy in every 10 levels where there will be bigger groups of enemies in sort of mini waves, and their unit types will also change within a single wave. Every 30 levels you will face elephants that are loaded with hp and offensive power. Luckily, you aren’t limited to the two types of units at the start: As soon as you summon a unit, the bar will start filling and you’ll be able to summon more during the fight.
In addition to summoning troops, you have a few active powers you can use. These are your defenses (catapult and towers) and your general powers (e.g. raining arrows on enemies.) Some are skill shots (like the catapult) and others just work (like the general power that gives a damage boost.) You can also choose the ammunition type of your towers to be more effective versus troops or siege units.
The second part of the game is the colony map where you invade colonies, upgrade them and defend them against rebels. There are several colonies with increasing defense strengths, indicated by numbers on them. You can have 3 legions in each attack, which have 6 unit slots each. My legion consists of 4 main units, my hero and the siege unit. I believe the rest is to add mercenaries and maybe probably other heroes as well. Not much to do here as you don’t summon extra units and have no towers. You just use your general powers. The enemy has some troops at the start and gets reinforcements, so usually you’ll use them on cooldown to win as soon as possible. Once you take over, you can upgrade them a few times to increase the income, then fight the rebel waves whenever you want. This is basically a reverse invasion: the strength of base depends on the colony and the whole army attacks altogether.
The game shop is pretty simple. You can buy crystals, which you can use to buy commanders and card packs. If you just want to unlock the heroes, the crystal package around 20€ is enough (Germany IOS store) and a more pragmatic approach might be to buy less crystals and only get the Roman Commander (the most expensive one,) or maybe buy the same amount of crystals and just use the surplus to upgrade him a bunch. For the record, you don’t need this hero. The one you get through the campaign is pretty good and has a gold bonus that should be useful for a new account.
In the end, it’s nice that the game does not force you buy anything. But then again, I usually buy something from free games if I spent some time on it… but I really didn’t feel like buying anything.
All in all, I did sink some hours into the game in the last days. But it was also because I was sick and resting at home. I feel like I’ll depart ways as I don’t think there is more to see in this game. It doesn’t feel challenging, there isn’t much to see other than a couple soldier models and the grind is way too steep.
That said, if you are looking for something to play on the train or you know, the sacred part of the house, feel free to take a look. I did enjoy majority of the time I sank.
Before I end the article, there is another topic I want to talk about.
Now, checking the downloads and review counts, I notice that GER is way bigger than Grow Castle but since I played Grow Castle first, I want to compare them a bit.
The major difference is that GrowCastle uses the auto fight mechanic. You get some of it via playing and you can purchase it if you want: Basically the game will launch waves on its own and will use skills on cooldown. Sounds weird, but it actually works because in the end, the game is super repetitive and you basically play because of three reasons: Leaderboards, to unlock everything to see how they work (that’s me) and either lack of or surplus of will power to unlock everything and max them out. For the second, you only need a certain amount of grind and you want to be done with them. The other two makes you grind A LOT. So you want the result but without the effort… because the effort is really just starting waves after a while, then upgrading something every 5–10 waves or so. It’s not skill, it’s monkey work (no offense to tablet using chimps.)
I really, really expected this to appear in GER because the core loops of the two games are literally the same. But it didn’t appear and honestly, I’m a bit disappointed. I would love to see the final forms of the soldiers but I don’t know if I want to endure through the grind.
Despite GER being the bigger title, I think Grow Castle was more interesting in terms of content. There are many heroes and tower types to choose from and you can actually have builds in that game. Unfortunately, it looked to me like in GER you can just upgrade the main soldiers (which are out of the Rock Paper Scissors — they have no advantages or disadvantages) and summon them and only them and succeed. The comments I’ve read online also indicate that way.
So if you liked GER, I would strongly recommend to check out Grow Castle too. In fact, I would recommend it over GER, unless you are here for the theme.

We sat on the edge of high seats, resting elbows and ales on a wine barrel that had been fashioned into a table. Pigeons cooed on the cobblestones around our feet, foraging for crumbs and shards of cracker crisp crust that rained to the ground as we bit into our sandwiches. I had to hunch over parted legs to keep from covering myself in falling arugula and dripping olive oil as I ate. Mike leaned similarly across from me, his sandwich partially exposed but still neatly cradled in its parchment wrapping, a wad of napkins clutched in his right hand to wipe the corners of his mouth as he sipped and chewed. Over his shoulder I watched my romanticized vision of Rome play like a scrolling vignette, fairytale pictures unfurling from the pages of a luxury travel magazine.
Families and tourists wandered the narrow side street like a driven flock, progressing from the Tiber River on to the Spanish Steps awaiting them at the end of the cobblestone shoot. Heads swiveled and eyes swept in every direction, not a single explorer mindful of the path directly in front of them. Each was lost in their own sense of wonder. I followed the gaze of a little girl in a flowery yellow sundress. She wore a pink hoodie to keep her warm against the early spring breeze and her mother tugged her along by the hand. As she traipsed her attention remained fixed on a large three dimensional cone jutting out above the door of an artisan gelato shop. A huge scoop of pistachio gelato perched so perfectly on the plastic waffle that I imagined it dripping onto her outstretched tongue as she passed underneath.
A young bride-to-be led a parade of attendants from a corner flower stall. They wound their way around and through the creeping throng of tourists. Each had their hands full with a flat of matching centerpiece arrangements. Porcelain white lilies with long slender stalks of green, perfectly positioned and pinned, peaking out of vases the way only an artist could do. The florist, minding brilliant pops of crimson, fuchsia and marigold under a vast white umbrella, beamed with a contented smile as she watched her artistry depart. She was roused from her prideful stare by a lovestruck gentleman wishing to purchase a bouquet. I adored this about Rome, the prevalence of corner flower stalls. These oases struck wild contradiction to the bustling chaos; a fragrant reminder to temper progress with love and frivolity.
Rome was all this way. Everyday life coexisting effortlessly with the fray of visitors. Housewives with canvas bags of fruit and loaves of bread. Delivery drivers beeping and weaving their scooters through seas of pedestrian traffic, indifferent to potential catastrophe. Shopkeepers wandered out of their stores to chat and smoke cigarettes with their neighbors. Fashionable couples walked dogs and tenants added to growing piles of refuse spilling out of already overfilled dumpsters. The sounds of suitcases rolling and clacking over ancient pavers mixing with the patter of peddlers. It was a symphony. I was in love with Rome’s nuanced perfection. But no moment brought me more joy than this — our simple picnic perched outside of IL Salumaio, immersed in it all.
I’d wanted one experience in Rome: an authentic Italian sandwich made with hand shaved artisan charcuterie, layered on rustic bread with fresh cheeses and fragrant oil. I craved the experience I’d witnessed TV chefs and travel vloggers drool over time and time again. I wanted to have my own moment. A first satisfying bite that would send my eyes rolling back in my head with gastronomic euphoria. Mike was eager for pizza but Rome to me had to be this consummate sandwich picked up at an authentic corner shop. It had to be a genuine place, a place locals might go themselves for lunch. I wanted the staff to be a little indignant at our brass to invade their native sanctuary with our travel maps and attempts at broken Italian. I’d been swooning over the fruition of this sandwich months before my first airport margarita.
And I was nervous. I did not want to waste my opportunity on an imitation or weak trattoria contender. How were we to choose? I’d researched so many possibilities that I was dizzy with worry. What if we got it wrong and my vision of Rome shattered, leaving me with rancid memories of crowded lineups and the unending wail of emergency vehicle sirens? The stakes were high. This was our last day in Rome, we’d almost used up our half dozen dining opportunities in the city before departing for Sorrento. Until the hunger rumbling in my belly grew louder than the nagging for success I was dangerously close to overthinking the whole thing and missing out on my quintessential sandwich experience entirely.
We were on route to the Spanish Steps, having spent the early part of the day touring the Vatican Museum. It was well past midday and I was growing cranky, I fully admit it. My morning cornetto and cappuccino wore off somewhere between the Sistine Chapel and St. Angelo Bridge and hunger was gaining control of my good mood and cheerful disposition. Mike and I have been married long enough to recognize when we’ve met the point of perturbation that requires one of us to maturely recognize the importance of food. He reeled me in, “let’s eat.” and I was fully on board. I no longer cared as much about the authenticity of the trattoria we would find, as I did the necessity to get the thing done and put some food in my belly.
Hunger is under-appreciated by the traveler. We tend so easily to keep full, to graze endlessly and maintain a constantly satiated state. Trying bits of this and that and endeavoring to consume memories with the same fervor we use to fill camera phones. Not often do we allow our bellies to rumble and tell us we’re low on fuel. But hunger, the small h kind with light pangs and hankerings, the kind that clouds your good humor and makes you snap with insincerity can be a good thing. That kind of hunger spurs creativity and shuts up the food critic who, back home, keeps grape jelly away from corn chips. It makes us fall for gas station hotdogs and lures us to try regional oddities, offal stew and platters of whole sardines grilled with lemon and paprika. Hunger can be a blessing to a food experience traveler. Sometimes it’s the only thing that gets us out of our own head and opens us up to chance encounters. Hunger, on this day, in its wisdom, turned us left and forced us across the threshold of the first shop we could locate with meats and cheeses hanging in the window.
Inside Il Salumaio the wall displayed a dozen menu offerings, a curated list of combinations customers could order with ease. No sandwich had more than five or six quality components, and every ingredient in its own right sounded downright delicious. Glass cases were filled with cured meats and ripe cheeses. Prosciuttos and aging coppas hung overhead. The smell of fresh bread wafted from behind saloon doors and the resulting large flat sheets of rustic loaves were piled on the counter waiting to be portioned and sliced open. Bowls of sun ripened pomodoro and fresh mozzarella di bufala, marinated artichokes and basil crowded one end of the display case. Bottles of olive oil, truffle oils and an array of balsamics lined a shelf behind the counter. The hinges of my jaw twinged and tingled. I wanted so badly to touch and smell everything, I wanted to devour a chisel of gritty parmesan and secure a handful of olives to stuff in my pocket for later.
I halted my rumbling instead with an offering of whisper thin pistachio studded mortadella piled with wedges of Grana Padano, honey infused truffle oil and a large handful of arugula. Mike opted for the Italiano, a simple combination of prosciutto crudo, mozzarella di bufalo, tomato and basil. And there we sat, out there in the street with the pigeons, taking it all in. Swapping our choices halfway through as we often do. Enjoying the simplest of meals curated by chance and living fully in the moment that will forever encapsulate the memory of Rome for me. That sandwich made it all real. It fixed the impression of Rome to my spirit for eternity and I’ll be forever grateful to hunger and serendipity for this moment.
Back home from time to time, I make large flattish loaves of ciabatta and pile them with the best Italian cured meats I can acquire. It costs a fortune compared to the few euros a hand held lunch with pigeons cost us in Rome but with the best company and a lovely smattering of quality olive oil I can almost smell the orange trees and the Tiber River. I add wedges of parm and ripe tomato, handfuls of arugula and metered doses of the truffle oil we brought home in our suitcase cocooned inside a clean pair of socks. We sit in near silence together, quietly reliving memories. I think of cobblestones and a little girl in a yellow flowered sundress. I crave gelato and run my mind over the smoothly worn treads of the Spanish Steps. Mike tosses coins into Trevi fountain and we circle the trek around the Coliseum. We partake in an evening passeggiata and visit the Pantheon at dusk, but I always come back to that moment on Via Della Croce when my eyes rolled back in my head, fully involved in that first magical bite of Italy.
This is the joy of traveling for me. Losing myself in unplanned encounters, tying my memories to meals I attempt to recreate at home. I owe so much of my joy to moments of hunger and its gentle reminder that letting go is part of the experience. A part that very often leads to the greatest discoveries and experiencing the true authenticity of a place. A reminder that the pleasure of something as mundane as a sandwich should never be overlooked. The whole of a culture could be hiding in just one bite.

Me, Chelsey, and Jahan — a proper girl group — hopped off the plane at Fiumicino. This was my first trip to a non English speaking country. I was a struggling actress, fretting over if my hair was too blonde and how I was coming across on camera. Meanwhile, in the background, something exciting was happening. It just didn’t know it yet.
We took a cab into the city (90 euros — which means we got majorly ripped off. This often happens to Americans. Offer 60 Euros and no more!) and arrived at a breathtaking piazza in Trastevere.
There were kids throwing glow circles into the air, there was live music, and hundreds of Romans and tourists alike were dining on the patios of the surrounding restaurants. The piazza was complete with a fountain and an ancient church— the pious statues looking down on the raucous social center with irony. We later found out it was the oldest church in Rome. This would be our home.
Our building in the piazza had a large front window where I’d often sit and stare down in the evening. I was very far from Ohio!

Earlier in 2023, I thought of fulfilling my wanderlust and taking off on a solo trip in Europe — something my younger self wouldn’t have even dreamed of.
In my attempt to live in the present (coupled with my habit of tardily posting photos), I felt it was important to journal my experiences to capture my raw thoughts and feelings while I travel.
I’m glad I wrote them as it took me months to finally get around to sharing my travel stories, but here we go.
1/X: Barcelona, Spain || June 2023
Rome, Italy || July 2023
The day this photo was taken was the day I just did more sight-seeing: revisiting the Trevi Fountain, exploring the Spanish Steps and going around Piazza di Spagna, and marveling at the Pantheon.
I was grateful I didn’t have to take a long time in these places because the reality was that I was feeling anxious, looking for a repair shop that could service an American model of my luggage just a day before I depart for Firenze.
I knew and I’ve been warned it was not the wisest idea to travel by myself to my hand-picked destinations with a big luggage in tow. I still did it anyway, thinking I could somehow have a semblance of home and comfort packed in a suitcase.
That time, I was only a week away from home, but boy, did I feel the most alone.
Traveling is definitely fun, but what we don’t see in photos is how it could invoke some feelings of anxiety too.
I eventually found myself capping the night at Trastevere.
I’m glad I made it well that day. As usual, thanks to the people providing care and support in person and virtually, and for that night, for that rich plate of truffle pasta and a glass of wine to comfort me.
I leave Roma today to transfer to Firenze.
This city captivated me — maybe made me fall in love — during last year’s visit with my family; it’s one of the main reasons why I wanted to return to Italy.
But today I recognize how life continues to surprise us —
like that time I walked through the ruins of the Colosseo and be reminded that I used to wonder about it when I was a child but never deeply dreamed of it because I thought it was impossible to see,
but also I have those times when I’ve been working towards a dream, a desire, and then realizing it may not necessarily be what I want or need.
So here’s a little (self-)reminder: I hope that when things aren’t going how you think they’re supposed to be, open up yourself to the opportunity, and trust that life will continue to surprise you.

Dear friend,
I’m holding a glass of Aperol spritz, and this is the view in front of me. It’s a hot April afternoon in Rome, about 25 degrees. I’m wearing my black dress, feeling the Roman elegance. A slight breeze touches my face.
On the way here, we climbed a hill. There were many people around in their stylish outfits-tourists and Italians. We ascended numerous stairs that seemed to stretch up to the sky. The stairs were made of stone and they were old, like everything in Rome.
After climbing so many stairs, we entered a garden filled with tall trees. There were no tourists here, only Romans. I guess this is one of Rome’s hidden treasures. I only hear Italian being spoken, no other languages.
It’s hot, and the sun is shining directly on my face. I take a sip of my Aperol spritz and feel better. It has ice in it. I take a piece of ice into my mouth and let it cool me down.
The view is spectacular. It takes my breath away. There are so many beautiful buildings in front of me. It feels like sitting in a park with a large balcony in the middle of Rome, admiring the city. Rome knows how to melt your heart; you just have to let it. It is so beautiful, maybe the most beautiful city in the world, at least for me up to now.
There is a big church on my left and a few more on the horizon. Far away, you can see trees blending into the cityscape. The street below curves to the right, with many cars passing by. I take out my sketchbook and start to draw.
Valentine is sitting next to me. I love him a lot, and I’m happy we’re here together. Now he is talking to me about his girlfriend. I like that we’re so open with each other.
Too bad, I finished my drink. The sun is shining intensely, and there are two boys next to us. One of them is shirtless. He reminds me of a character from “Call Me by Your Name.” He looks very young and has a beautiful body like the sculptures in Rome. They’re smoking weed; I can smell it from here.
People around me are speaking Italian. I don’t understand it, but I like it. I think if I were Roman, I would come to this place a lot. And if you were visiting me, I would bring you here.
I know you would like to write your diary here or read your book, maybe Fernando Pessoa’s poems. This place feels like a little escape from the chaos of the city, a spot to sit, relax, and savor Rome.
The place is called Villa Aldobrandini, with the stairs located on Via Mazzarino. I really think you should visit this park. I painted the view for you to find it easily. There is a part of me there, you should visit that place.
Love,
Me

I found this today:
# hosts# Generate standard hosts tables.# Newnet doesn’t really use it, it’s just for easy reference.# Neither does oldnet now, since it’s doing DNS right.#
It lives on line 327 of a Makefile used to build and distribute various configurations around our infrastructure. And it’s old. “How old”, you might ask?
Those lines have been in that file for 19 years. I know that, because I have primary historical evidence, as they say in archaeology.
When I asked about this “oldnet” thing, my boss told me to look up a document, Tenwen: The Re-engineering Of A Computing Environment. It’s a peer reviewed paper from LISA’94 that chronicles the creation of the fabric underlying the network that I administer today.
In the paper, under Fixed Name Service (September 1992):
Once name service was working, we modified the Newnet hosts to do hostname lookups correctly.
This fixed the naming problems for Newnet, but Oldnet was still broken. While we wanted to limit the amount of work we put into Oldnet, we also felt that having name service working correctly could only make it easier to administrate Newnet. We therefore modified Oldnet to use the nameserver on Newnet, and quit using host files on Oldnet as well.
So, those lines date to September, 1992. I was 13 years old.
One time, a couple of weeks after I started working here, one of the other admins asked me what I thought of all of it. The infrastructure, the network, and so on. It took a couple of seconds for me to put my thoughts together, and I said, “Have you ever been to Rome?”
He had, so I continued, “This network is Rome”.
He was confused, understandably, so I explained.
Some networks are like Phoenix, AZ. They’re relatively new and shiny. They’re brought up for the purpose they serve, and for the time in which they exist. There’s not a building in Phoenix over 125 years old. It was built according to relatively modern methods, and the streets are largely laid out in a grid, because there wasn’t a whole lot to get in their way. The city was started from essentially a clean slate.
Some networks, particularly in non-technological companies, are much more like Ephesus in Turkey. Ephesus is amazing…it’s kind of like a metropolis the size of Orlando just got up and left. Seriously, I was there, and it was mind-boggling. It’s almost exactly like it was 1500 years ago. There has been no modern development there, so when you walk through it, you’re in the midst of miles of ruins.
Rome, on the other hand, is a different sort of beast. Romulus founded the City of Seven Hills 2,500 years old, if you believe the legends, and it has been occupied for pretty much the entire time since. When you climb out of an underground Metro station full of artifacts excavated while digging the subway tunnels you just left, you may find yourself facing an Roman gladiatorial arena turned into a Catholic church. The modern Rome grew up out of the old, and there’s a continual architectural history of the past 2500 years waiting on you to find it.
It’s the exact same way here on this network. The new Windows desktop infrastructure runs smoothly alongside the host database mentioned in the paper above, written 20 years ago. It relies on the host database, actually. Like Rome’s streets, sewer, viaducts, and aquaducts, these antique systems were vital to the time, and if they aren’t still in use, they paved the way for the modern systems that replaced them.
Being someone who likes archaeology, antiquities, and old libraries and junk stores, working here is a pleasure, because there’s always something new to discover, and like I did today, a rich history behind it.

Everywhere I turned in Rome, there were overwhelmingly inspiring sights, but they were overrun by tourists, myself included. All week, I purposely was getting off the beaten path, scouring the city for places away from the tourist crowds. I find it hard to fully enjoy Rome with the constant crush of tourists everywhere I turn.
This Sunday, however, dawned differently. A strange quiet settled over the city. No honking horns, no chattering crowds, just the gentle gurgling of the Tiber River as I walked along its banks. I’d gotten up much earlier than usual, setting out on a walk from my Vatican City apartment to Trastevere, a charming neighbourhood in Rome.
The river’s curvy ribbon unfolded before me, its surface a polished mirror reflecting the soft glow of the awakening sun. Crossing the Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II, a bridge of pale stone and impressive arches, I paused to admire the view. Soft pastel colours, like scoops of gelato, washed over the city — a sea of terracotta rooftops dotted with church domes. Rome is a scene straight out of a postcard.
I relish the quietness of the city, broken only by the rhythmic pounding of lone runners and the occasional flash of brightly coloured bikes zipping past me. Sticking to the eastern side of the river, I watched the city slowly stir to life.
Reaching Ponte Garibaldi, I took in the panorama again. This vantage point revealed how far I’d wandered, with St. Peter’s Basilica’s dome just a distant peak. In front of me, a tiny emerald oasis emerged from the river — Tiber Island. A bright orange building, like a giant creamsicle, stood at its tip. (This is the hospital, by the way!)
Two bridges connect Tiber Island. Ponte Fabricio, the oldest bridge in Rome, stood strong with its thick stone arches from 62 BC. Beside it, Ponte Cestio is adorned with three graceful arches. Crossing over, I am greeted by the tourist-favourite Trastevere neighbourhood.
Trastevere was just waking up. Street cleaners swept away the remnants of Saturday night’s partying. Trucks rumbled by, collecting overflowing bins. Storefronts remained shuttered, and chairs and tables stacked high are starting to be dismantled setting up for Sunday lunch. It’s a neighbourhood waking and preparing for a new day’s performance.
Wandering through Trastevere’s narrow streets, I admired its unique beauty. Peeling paint, colourful graffiti, overflowing flower boxes, ivy climbing the walls, and laundry strung cheerfully across the balconies — even the “rundown” parts held a charm.
Reaching the tall stone archway, Porta Portese, I entered the famed Sunday flea market. But the peaceful bliss of my morning walk vanished instantly. Chaos engulfed me — shouts, haggling, and mountains of stuff piled everywhere. It was a stark contrast to the serenity I’d enjoyed just hours earlier.
Later that day, nestled in a cozy Trastevere trattoria buzzing with Sunday family lunch, I savoured my delicious cacio e pepe. The quiet morning walk solidified a travel revelation for me: waking up early unlocks a hidden side of the city.
For anyone who truly wants to experience a place, especially one as busy as Rome, consider rising with the sun. Early mornings offer a rare moment of tranquillity, allowing for a deeper connection to a city.
Even if you’re not a morning person, dedicate one day on your trip to this slow travel approach. You might be surprised by the magic you discover in the quietness of the city.

Rome is home to many churches and religious sites. Catholicism has deep-seated roots in the city, which is made even more apparent since the city is home to the pope.
I visited the city last month with some students on my first Spring Break tour. Part of the tour was a three-day stay in Rome. We visited the Vatican and the Colosseum and even took a day trip to visit Pompeii. The city is filled with piazzas and pizzas at every turn. Rome breathes history; if you can get away from the crowds.
This year, Rome was crowded a bit more than usual due to the Jubilee celebration. We often found ourselves working our way through busy crowds of fellow visitors, trying to take a photo at some of the most well-known sites.
Still, we found ourselves able to enjoy the city with its plazas and shops. One thing to remember about Italy is that they are not in a hurry like Americans tend to be. If you sit down at a cafe for lunch, expect to be there for an hour at least. Enjoy your meal, and maybe a nice glass of Italian wine.
If you visit Rome, try to find places that are less well-known to tourists. Yes, we saw the Trevi Fountain, the Colliseum, and the Forum. And while these places are amazing and worth spending time in, there are plenty of places in…

If you had been strolling down Corso Vittorio Emanuele in Rome among the many exclusive shops and charming sidewalk cafes on a sunny Sunday afternoon a few years ago, you might have seen eight well-dressed, middle-aged-to-elderly people slugging, kicking, cursing, and wrestling each other on the sidewalk, as a small crowd looked on.
Utterly unprepared for a street brawl, four American tourists and an Italian family sprang into what can only be called clumsy, slapstick, stop-the-chaos-at-any-cost, WHAT-THE-F*CK?!, schoolyard defense mode.
I know because I was one of them.
Until then, it had been a relaxing Italian vacation with my close friends Jenny and Doug, and my (now ex-)wife. We had traveled to Rome to attend the wedding of some friends and had spent the subsequent couple of weeks touring around Italy together on holiday.
We’d had a wonderful time driving aimlessly around in a toy-size rental car playing archeologists to Italy’s hieroglyphic road signs.
We’d marveled at paintings of naked people and mythological heroes in museums and did all we could to assist the natives in their efforts to vanquish the copious amounts of red wine and pasta the country…

“Take the first steps in faith. You do not have to see the whole staircase.” Martin Luther King Jr.
The Spanish Steps are one of the most recognizable places in the Eternal City. This place became popular long before the advent of mass tourism. At the beginning of the 16th century, the first hotels were built here, and in the 17th century, Spain acquired the Monaldeschi Palace and turned the building into an embassy. From that moment on, the square began to be called Spanish.
The stairs were paid for by a French diplomat, Étienne Gueffier, who thought it would be a great idea to connect The Spanish Square Piazza di Spagna to the French Santissima Trinita dei Monti church as a symbol of unity between Spain and France.
Did you ever count the steps by running up and down the stairs? I counted 270 steps during my round trip from the street level to the top and back — until a local policeman, carabinieri, tried to stop me.
They could not catch up and yelled at me not to run up the stairs. I giggled like a schoolgirl caught running by a principal.
As I ran the stairs, I remembered Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck sitting together on the Spanish Steps in their movie Roman Holiday. Watching Hollywood movies was how I learned European geography as a little girl.

We’ve finally found a grocery store right before closing time. It’s nighttime and the city pulsates nearby, colorful walkways beckoning us to invest more walking time, to explore one more little corner. But it’s crucial to get supplies for an evening snack and therefore a comfortable morning.
Whoa, what’s this?
It seems there’s a one-way flow of traffic through this store. I’ve passed the fruit section but decided I’d better get some more tomatoes after all. My feet are screaming at me to stop walking. As I reverse course for those cherished tomatoes, I face an onslaught of busy Romans going the proper and correct way in the store. I’m odd man out, like a salmon swimming my way upstream in a sea of annoyed Italians who’re peeved I haven’t learned the one-way-traffic etiquette.
What the hell is up with this freakin’ store layout, my brain screams. Why do they have to make it so complicated? Humans can’t be expected to always get what they need in the absolute same order every time!!
My partner Eddie and I make it to the checkout line with our bounty. Success. We’ll be back to the room and crashed out in bed in no time.

You never owned the terra firma of your conquests,Or the seven hills of your Eternal City,
You were but a transient occupying space at a moment in time.
Scorching the earth of those daring to oppose you,Sacking cities, devouring abundance, and smelting gold,
Your patricians choked on the gluttony of your spoils.
Sweating blood from the souls of the indigenous,Condemning slaves to perish in arenas of folly,
You demanded loyalty or slaughter.
Shearing forests to build your ships,Swallowing wilderness with your pastures,
Fallow were your promises of justice, freedom, and security.
Buying mercenaries with your taxes and tarrifs,Burying the poor with your worthless denarii,
Your gods crumbled into a common grave.
Woe to The Empire, Sunk into oblivion by corruption and greed,
Destiny is never kind to the likes of you!

Italy has always been my dream destination as I grew up watching Bollywood movies where many Italian places like the Colosseum, Venice, and the Leaning Tower of Pisa are shown. During my work assignment in Switzerland, I had the incredible opportunity to explore this beautiful country in just three days. Starting from Zurich, my journey took me to Milan, Venice, Pisa, and Rome. Even though my schedule was tight, this trip was unforgettable where I was lucky to see stunning places and have delightful moments.
Let me take you through my whirlwind Italian 3-day trip.

Flo is one of the first to enter the city after Nazis retreat
My mother and Audie Murphy ch. 15
The city of Rome was liberated by Allied troops June 4, 1944. Flo got to Rome the next day, June 5. She told me she was proud to come into the city with General Mark Clark and the U.S. 5th Army. The Third Division had taken big hits in battles at Anzio and on the Italian coast. Rome would be an easy victory, a source of prestige for the leaders and pride for infantrymen recovering from those battles. Later, historians and Allied commanders agreed that Clark’s decision to march into Rome instead of cutting off a large part of the retreating German army was a major blunder, extending the war for maybe another year. In any case, the liberation of Rome was overshadowed by the D-Day landings on the beaches of Normandy in northern France on June 6.
Flo kept detailed notes in a tiny pocket-sized diary. This was the first entry.
Monday June 5, 1944
Came into Rome in amphib Jeep with Frank Gates.
They were traveling from the camp at Pozzuoli, a seaside town on the Gulf of Naples where they’d been bivouacked with the Third Division. At first I imagined that they drove the 138 miles on the bombed out rutted roads. But these amphibious jeeps were faster in the water than on land, so now I’m thinking they traveled on the water. Amphib jeeps were used by the Third Division because they were training for an amphibious landing in France that would take place in August.
Flo didn’t make note of who was with her and Frank Gates, but I’m imagining all four of the American Red Cross women in her group went to Rome together. Gates was able to secure a promise from a rich anti-Nazi Roman to allow the ARC clubmobilers to stay in his fancy villa. The four women moved in soon after. The man did much to make them comfortable.
I wasn’t able to find information about Frank Gates but I believe he was Flo’s boss, the Red Cross director on the Italian front whose job was to establish ARC canteens and clubs near the front lines of fighting. He would be driving around Rome to look for suitable buildings in which to house the clubs.
Unlike Naples, which had been bombed for years, Rome had been spared from widespread destruction by the Nazis in part due to its declaration as an “open city” by the Italian government and the efforts of the Vatican to protect it, which led to a relatively peaceful occupation and liberation. No one, perhaps not even the Nazis, wanted to be responsible for destroying that historic city.
The 1945 Italian film Rome, Open City, directed by Roberto Rossellini, takes place during the Nazi occupation of Rome. It was one of the first post-war Italian films to gain major acclaim internationally.
The ARC women were some of the first Americans to move into Rome. Before Allied troops started coming in, they had the city almost to themselves and set about seeing all the tourist sights. Flo wanted to see all the famous architectural treasures she had read about as a child.
From a report in the Yakima Herald-Republic:
Life in the Italian theatre of war can be fun as well as hard work for American Red Cross workers, Miss Florence Wick told her mother, Mrs. Gerda Wick of Yakima, in a recent letter.
“So much and so many exciting things have happened since I left home that I can’t believe any of it yet,” Miss Wick said. “This last event is the biggest dream yet. I am writing this in my new home, which is a beautiful, spacious Italian villa. We four girls moved in yesterday from our dusty camp down the road and have the whole villa and grounds to ourselves.
“There is a bathroom and bedroom for each of us and we truly live like princesses in a fairy tale. The villa belongs to a very wealthy Italian, who is an anti-fascist, who lost his whole family to the Germans. He loves to do favors for us.”
High praise for Capt. Harold Haines of Yakima was voiced by the Red Cross woman.
“Capt. Haines is something of a hero over here,” she said. “Fighting in a war does things like ‘knocking off’ officers and men, but Haines is one of the very few original officers left. Yakima should be very proud of him. His own men are and that’s the acid test out here.”
The nice weather makes it even more pleasant to drive around the various areas to serve the men, Miss Wick said. Because the unit is not yet equipped to turn out doughnuts for all the men, she has had time to visit interesting places she has read about but never expected to see. Mt. Vesuvius and the ancient city of Pompeii are among the sights she has seen.
“I don’t know how long we will be in this beautiful place,” Miss Wick said, “but we are going to enjoy it as long as we do stay. No doubt we will be roughing it again in a tent or bombed out building before long. I won’t mind that if I get to stay with this grand division.”
The ARC women didn’t stay in the villa in Rome very long. By July 9 Flo is back in the camp, writing in her diary about cleaning their tent.

I posted a picture on twitter yesterday from one of my World History lessons where students perform an “autopsy” on the Roman Empire that garnered some attention.
A number of teachers asked for details of the lesson, so rather than try and explain it out in 140 characters several times to several different people, I just decided to put my write up here.
First: Obviously the medical gear is not required for the lesson. But I will say, if you’re willing to drop about $35 per class, it actually made a difference. This was the first year I added that piece to the lesson (based on student requests from last year), and it definitely played a role in helping get “in character” for performing an autopsy.
The major objective of the lesson is to have students demonstrate the ability to evaluate multiple historical perspectives on why the Roman Empire collapsed and form their own interpretation on why Rome fell based on the available evidence.
This could easily be accomplished without an autopsy — I could hand them sources and treat it as a document analysis assignment. But I was looking for something that was a little out in left field (those are the things that stick, right?) and required group collaboration to help vocalize the thought processes necessary for good historical analysis.
Lesson Origins
I will not take credit for this lesson idea. This is a common lesson shared among AP World History teachers. In the original form that I saw, students were asked to conduct autopsies on the “Gunpowder Empires” (Safavid, Mughal, Ottoman Empires). Some teachers also did it for classical empires (like Rome and Han China). So if you like the concept but not my execution, please go look at other iterations of the lesson. You can just google search “AP World Empire Autopsy” and see tons of examples.
I decided to narrow it down to just Rome because I wanted to have follow up conversations about the collapse of Rome based on their competing interpretations. I usually give student groups at least some unique historical arguments to help produce different results. So I wanted a more in depth approach to Rome versus the broad based comparative option with the original lesson.
I also wanted a lesson I could use in either my regular or AP sections of World History. I’m really big on the idea that both classes should emphasize the same skills and concepts, and that the only difference is the level of rigor. I don’t want the idea of developing historical thinking skills to be reserved for just one subset of my students.
Materials Used
Set Up Lecture
I walk them through the chronology of Rome’s collapse. As I explain it to the students, I’m going to establish time of death, they’re going to establish what killed Rome. So we go over the Crisis of the Third Century, Diocletian, Constantine, the East/West split, all the way to the final fall of Rome in 476. We cover the increased use of Germanic troops in the Roman army a little bit, because otherwise Odoacer does not make much sense to the students.
Initial Interpretation Analysis
I have a word document that has summaries of many of the theories for Rome’s collapse compiled together. I made it so there are even page breaks — no summary goes over one page. Some pages may have 2 or 3 different theories if they have shorter explanations. Each student in the group is expected to look at 1–2 pages and take notes on the main arguments.
A couple group members will need to head out into the hallway or some other space to trace the body outlines on the paper. When they’re done they come back in and read over some of the interpretations. What I usually do to distribute the work load is have the folks that stay in the room the whole time read 2 pages, and the folks that went out into the hall read 1.
Group Discussion and List Building
After they’ve had time to read through and make their observations, have them come together as a group and share what they found. I put the list of what body parts these “injuries” would correspond to:
I encourage students to get creative on the type of injury that they are identifying. Is it a minor issue? Maybe that’s a bruise. Major issue? Broken bone. Don’t give the students too much guidance because they get pretty creative on their own. For example, a group identified a shutdown of intestine functions to represent sharp decline in farm output in the empire.
Give them a few minutes to have this conversation, and then it is time to conduct the autopsy.
The “Autopsy”
The students lay their body outline down on the tables and begin marking it up with corresponding injuries. I show them that on most autopsy reports, they simply circle the site of the injury and then write commentary on what the injury is. That is what I expect for them on theirs, although some like to draw in the actual injury (so students draw broken bones, or one group drew kidneys that were a gross brown to represent kidney failure) and I’m fine with that.
The students have laptops that can flip into tablets, so many of them had their notes up on a google doc that they used for reference while they marked up the body.
Students are still deliberating about where to place injuries at this point — and that is totally okay. I try to be active around the room and interject into conversations either to validate their observation OR to encourage them to think of some different angles (e.g. for example, a group mentioned Constantine in reference to the rise of Christianity, because some historical interpretations argue Christianity contributed to the downfall of Rome. I pressed them to think about how Constantine may have contributed to a spinal injury … and they looked back and made the connection to him ending Diocletian’s tetrarchy).
As they wind down marking up the body, students have to pull up their shared google doc with the autopsy report and mark down what injuries they noted on the body (I have them do this step because they will often slim down or modify the list from what they originally developed as they’re actually mapping the injuries out on the body).
Conclusion
Once they are done, they take off the gear and turn in their body maps. They then sit down as a group and finish the google doc. Under the Opinion section, they need to develop a thorough analysis of cause of death. I usually specify the following requirements:
This is the most challenging part, but it is well worth the student results. They are engaging in a critically important historical skill, and rather than just memorizing a list of reasons why Rome ended, they’re actually being challenged to answer the question themselves.
I have about 60 minutes for this activity. Usually students start formulating their conclusion but need time the next day to finish. I use this as a pivot to discuss the next day and then introduce the Byzantines.

I’ve never been to Rome, but I know that I struggle with crowded places, and how the crowds don’t seem to change much even out of season in many tourist spots. Rome definitely sounds like a once only experience!

I traveled through Europe, and I’ve been home a month now. Contrary to what I’d expected, my time away only made me more acutely aware of just how beautiful it is here… this little piece of California, where I grew up.
Not that the things I saw in Europe were any less beautiful. No; there, I saw things I could never have imagined, things that took my breath away with their utter unexpectedness and newness (oldness, really, but all new to me). But I think I’ve come back with a kinder, more appreciative eye. I got in the habit, while traveling, of perceiving the wonder in everything; now, when I look around the place where I grew up, I’m pausing more to reflect, to capture memories as if with a camera, and not forget.
Here, at home, the hills are a deep green this time of year; we’re starting to get a few of those summery days that are just barely too hot, but then perfect all evening long; children are riding their bicycles in the street and laughing like they can feel the school year coming to its end. The other day, I walked by a big Mexican bush sage, and the smell brought back a thousand memories of childhood, of playing in the backyard with my sisters long after dark, when we had our own bush of that sweet-smelling, lavender-colored plant. And as much as I adored my travels, much as I already can’t wait to go again someday, and hard as it was to leave, I did miss the context I have here at home: the memories that come with all the smells and sights and tastes. The memories of my life, memories of me.
And the truth, I found, is that one of the things I loved most about the lush greenery, rolling countrysides, and swaying olive trees in Italy was how much it reminded me of home.
•••
I miss Italy. I missed it as soon as I left it. It’s in no way very original of me; most people I’ve talked to who have ever visited there say the exact same thing. But there really is just something magnetizing about it to us American folks.
I set up my base in Venice and Florence, but did have the chance to see two other Italian cities — only for one day each, mind you, but with the impression they made on me, it only seems fair I give them their own post here. For one day, I saw Rome, and for one day, I saw Milan. Sometime — I hope sooner rather than later — I’ll go back to Italy, and make it much longer than just two more days.
•••
I almost didn’t go to Rome. I had long planned that I would take a day trip from Florence and make the pilgrimage, but found I loved Florence so much that I didn’t want to spare a moment from it. In the end, I tore myself away and hopped the train — because how can you go all the way to Europe and not see Rome? — and I’m so, so glad I did.
Rome is often called the Eternal City, and it is every bit deserving of such a grandiose name. As I walked through the busy downtown, observing the perfect coexistence of ancient ruins, modern buildings, and everything in between, I felt that there really was something eerily eternal about this place. Structures from 2,000 years ago stand as though nothing ever changed, utterly undeterred by the passage of time, the rising and falling of empires and regimes, the growth of a whole new society around them — or the nosy wanderings of tourists like me, seeking to get a glimpse into the heart of this place, what so many of us learn is the birthplace of our modern world.
First laying eyes on the Colosseum was surreal. The only thing I can think to compare it to, though obviously I have never had this experience, is that moment that astronauts first see Earth from space: a rush of feelings, mostly it’s real, and I’m really seeing this, and we really are so, so small. Because faced with something that’s survived two millennia, how can you feel any other way?
Of course, thinking of just how many people and animals died horrifically in the Colosseum, all for the entertainment of others, adds a whole other layer to the experience of beholding this long-standing and impressive place. I reflected a lot, while I was there, on our own humanity — are we really much better today? We like to think of history as being synonymous with progress, with always getting better, but we are certainly willing to excuse a lot of suffering from our fellow human beings, all in the name of being entertained, aren’t we?
But then, that’s another conversation, entirely.
As exciting as it was to see the Colosseum, stumbling upon the Pantheon — because stumble is exactly what I did — was even more bizarre. While the Colosseum, Palatine Hill, and the Forum all stand somewhat set apart from Rome’s main city center — preserved in their own sort of ancient “neighborhood” — the Pantheon is just right there, downtown, surrounded by restaurants, apartments, and businesses of our modern age. You would almost miss it, assume it was a replica or even just an especially pretty building, if you weren’t looking for it (and I was looking, and still almost walked on by).
If my hometown provides me context for myself, and my own beginnings, Rome gave me some of that for all of us—for humanity. Not that we all descended from the Romans, or that our forms of government and society were all influenced by them; rather, being in the Eternal City, seeing this strange marriage of the old and the new, brought me to reflect on — despite how young humanity is compared to most of the universe — just how long we’ve been here. Surely it’s been long enough now that there’s no excuse to still embrace the kind of violence that the Romans loved watching in the Colosseum. I hope that, the longer we stick around, we will keep trying to get better.
•••
It would be disingenuous of me not to admit the biggest reason I was determined to visit Rome, and it had nothing to do with ancient history. I have wanted to see the city for years because of a certain Romantic poet who spent his last few months, and ultimately died, there.
I was sixteen when I first started reading John Keats. Fascinated at that age by his beautiful yet doomed romance with Fanny Brawne, I upheld a thing of beauty is a joy forever (from his “Endymion”) as a life motto, and longed to write the way he could. I took a class on English Romanticism in undergrad and felt almost like I was “cheating” on Keats with how much I unexpectedly ended up loving Coleridge’s work; still, “Ode to a Nightingale” reigned supreme as my favorite poem (it’s still way up there). And since I discovered him, I’ve been troubled by his tragic early death, but I really could not have predicted how much visiting his museum in Rome was going to affect me.
It’s called the Keats-Shelley House — as it’s dedicated not just to Keats but to all the Romantic writers, including Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley. The rosy-orange house stands, quiet and unassuming, right beside the Spanish Steps. When Keats began to deteriorate, his doctors sent him out of England to take the warmer climate in Rome, hoping that would restore him to health; he moved into this house in late 1820. He was dead in four months. He was 25.
When I first read Keats, at 16 years old, 25 sounded almost old to me. Now, I’m 25. And God, his life was only starting. Many scholars say that had he lived longer, he would have surpassed Shakespeare as the best and most prolific writer in the English language. He was a baby.
When I visited the museum, I got to see the room where he died. It’s small, with a fireplace, a desk, a bed, and two little windows, one of which overlooks the Spanish Steps. His illness did not deter him from enjoying the view, and he liked to look out at all the activity below, especially the bubbling clear waters of the square’s boat fountain (which is still there today). He died of tuberculosis, though his doctors resisted that diagnosis until the very end; and as a result, he was refused ample pain medication, and died suffering, terribly. That was really, really hard to learn, especially while standing in the same room where it all happened. I felt, suddenly, a little sick, and I wanted to cry, but I couldn’t.
But it isn’t fair to remember him, or anyone, just for his death. The museum does an excellent job of reminding visitors who Keats and his contemporaries were — that, though now they are all gone, they were once full of the gorgeous vibrancy of life, and created beautiful art that will never, ever die.
I learned that, despite the image we have today of a perpetually fragile and delicate Keats, he was a scrappy little guy in school, getting into many a fistfight before he discovered what good outlets reading and writing were. I learned how much he loved his siblings — he was the oldest, like me — and how much it devastated him when his little brother, Tom, died of tuberculosis at 19 (John had nursed him, as these were, of course, days before it was known to be contagious). I learned that, before he went to Rome to die, he charged his fiancée Fanny and his younger sister to always stay in touch, so they would have each other; and I learned that the two women did, and remained best friends for the rest of their long lives. I even saw a lock of his hair, and learned that despite my own vision of John Keats as a brooding brunette, he was, in fact, a towhead blonde.
Hardly anyone left that museum with a dry eye. It’s not easy subject matter, and they do an incredible job making it all come alive and feel real. But I left feeling hopeful, in a way, because what an incredible thing it is that so many people are still impacted by his story, and his art.
One older Italian woman, who was visiting at the same time as me, kept clutching her chest and rhapsodically saying, “oh, me amo Keats, me amo Keats.” I hope that, somehow, the wonder of the Eternal City allowed him to hear that, and to know how much he means.
•••
Perhaps knowing how reluctant I was to leave Italy, the universe conspired to keep me there an extra day. My plan to visit Bern, the capital of Switzerland, was foiled by weekend rail strikes on ItaliaRail, and I ended up stranded for a night in Milan.
It was quite the stroke of luck, because I absolutely loved Milan. More similar to Berlin than anywhere I visited in Italy, this city was like a hub of art, youth culture, and progressive modernity. I walked to the canal in the late afternoon to soak in the last light; there were young people smoking cigarettes atop brick walls covered in graffiti, and a street market full of vendors selling handmade gifts. I bought a pair of earrings for my sister, then wandered until after dark, trying to savor my last few hours here… this country I had come to love so much.
•••
Indeed, Italy was somewhere I had always known that I would love, but I guess I couldn’t have imagined how much. At the Keats-Shelley House, there was a list of American and British artists, writers, and thinkers who, at one point or another, made Rome their home, and it just went on and on. Longfellow, Dickens, Alcott, Browning, Copley, Ruskin. Keats, of course, though I know he must have wished it was under happier circumstances; still, he loved that view of the Spanish Steps, so much.
There’s just something about you, Italy, that inspires one to create, I think — and to make oneself at home. How else would I still be writing about you a month-and-a-half later, still thinking of you when I see my own home’s green hills, rolling countrysides, and olive trees?
•••
ROME
Activities: Visit the Colosseum and the Roman Forum (tip: plan ahead! the lines were excruciatingly long, and I didn’t have time to go in; buy tickets online so you can skip the lines). See the Trevi Fountain (tip: go in the morning, before the crowds arrive, or else you may have trouble even seeing much of that gorgeous, cool, clear water!). Go to the Keats-Shelley House and the Spanish Steps (this museum was so impactful and beautiful, and all in English; and the Spanish Steps are like their own separate world within Rome, just a gorgeous neighborhood).
My Best Meal: I only ate once in Rome, stopping in a little grocery and grabbing a salame and fontina panini. But let me tell you! That was one delicious panini. As with everywhere in Italy, there are a thousand restaurants every where you look and everyone is guaranteed to be amazing; wander off the main tourist tracks to find somewhere more affordable.
MILAN
My Hostel: QUO Milano / Cost: about 25 euros a night / Recommend?: Yes! Great common area, cute decor, nice room (we had our own bathroom, as well), and very affordable. It’s a tram ride from the train station, but all the main points of interest in the city are walking distance.
Activities: Go see the Milan Cathedral, walk by the canal, look closely at the street art, and talk to people (everyone was so kind in Milan).
My Best Meal: A Sicilian cannoli! One of the best desserts I had the entire trip. Stop into any given bakery as you walk the city, and I promise it will be delicious.

In my last article, I wrote about getting from FCO (Rome’s largest Airport) to Termini (Rome’s central train station which also serves as a major hub for Rome’s public transportation).
Of course, it leaves the question, “What if I arrive in Rome at the CIA (Ciampino Airport)?”
Great question, reader!
If you’re not familiar with budget flights by low-cost carriers like RyanAir, EasyJet, and the no-longer-bankrupt Norwegian Airlines, then let me offer a small introduction.
Your friend told you that they found a $5 flight from Paris to Berlin. “Crazy,” you think.
Then you go to Skyscanner (affiliate link) and find out that isn’t such a stretch.
In fact, I found an $11 flight from Paris’s BVA to Tangier, Morocco leaving October 13, 2022. This is just one of many examples.
“What a deal!” you think.

""Let me tell you about Rome, my beloved Roma, so ancient she is called eternal, the city that has always been and will always be. Assured of her own magnificence, her venerable significance, she does not seek comparison - and yet I find it almost impossible not to compare her.""
This is the opening of Mark Lamprell’s The Lovers' Guide to Rome and I fell in love with these words immediately. I was compelled to read them aloud, they have a wonderful lyrical quality to them.
Have you ever been to Rome? The author’s note says this novel was written outdoors, around the streets and piazzas of Rome and it shows. There is a lovely liveliness and intimacy in the treatment of these locations that took me right back there amongst the stone angels and gelato stands.
This book was given to me with the description that it was a ""happy book"". As most of my reading material tends toward more UNhappy themes, I thought this might be a nice (and mentally healthy) change.
I was pleasantly surprised. The Lovers' Guide to Rome is a lovely, breezy, sunlit romp through the streets of Roma, as comfortable and cheerful as the best rom-coms, but beautifully written, with descriptions that make you want to read them aloud. I found the cast of characters engaging, with enough about them to be curious about and sympathise with, to make me want to read on.
I zipped through the first half on this on a two hour train journey and it was ideal for the task. Because you shouldn't have to put up with poorly written junk just because you're in the mood for something light!

I was in Rome standing outside St. Peter’s basilica when a thought crossed my mind: Am I entering a church or a museum? I was perfectly at bliss standing in line to enter one of the most famous architecture in the world. As I wandered through its interior, the more confused I was. Can this be considered as an art gallery? I had musings in my head to fill a notebook.
I had little knowledge about the church. I was astounded to discover it has eight chapels, 24 altars, and about 40 statues. I was bowled over by its grandeur. The moment I looked up, it was hard to look down. Why would you? The hymns and prayers seemed to be coming from above.
Two reasons drew me to the place. One was the movie ‘Da Vinci Code’ starring Tom Hanks as the lead Robert Langdon; the other was my running away from my problems.
Though I was raised with an amalgamation of Islam, Catholicism, Hindu and Buddhism, the basilicas in Rome offered me comfort that remains inexplicable. They called to me. Maybe it was the beauty of their architecture that drew me to them like a moth to a flame. Some questions are best left unanswered.
All I knew was I had made it to Rome. I was finally at bliss looking up 60 feet towards the…

Get a good data plan. We used Google Maps to get around EVERYWHERE. So much simpler than asking people for directions. Google Maps tells you which station to walk to, which subway line/bus to board, how long until the next train/bus arrives and how much time it will take you to reach your destination. You can either apply for a local SIM or check with your existing mobile services provider about international roaming plans (we used Airtel, and took their 30-day plan).
Learn how to say ‘please’, ‘thank you’, ‘you’re welcome’, ‘excuse me’ and ‘sorry’ in the local language. Don’t bother walking around with a dictionary — nobody expects you to master a whole new language. However, people are appreciative of the fact that you can respond in a language they understand — especially when you find you have to push your way through a crowd when your train arrives at the stop you need to get off at (‘pardon, pardon, PARDON’). Once you’ve taught yourself the words, they will roll off your tongue automatically in the appropriate situation because you’ll hear people using them all around you.
Invest in travel passes. All three cities we visited had various options (1-day, 3-day and 7-day passes) that we could use for unlimited trips across different modes of transport including buses, trams, subway and local trains. This makes so much financial sense and saves you the pain of having to buy a ticket for each trip you make. In Rome and Berlin, we had to validate the pass for the first trip after which we just had to make sure we had it with us in case ticket checkers came by. In Paris, we had to validate the ticket each time we entered a subway station/ boarded a bus.
Plan out which attractions/sights are most important to YOU. There are just so many options today. Sure you can get on a bus and do the highlights, but that doesn’t work for everyone. I desperately wanted to visit the Palace of Versailles and that’s often not on a typical ‘what to see in Paris in 3 days’ list. We also managed to get tickets to a Katy Perry show in Berlin (we booked these about a month and a half before we actually left India!). I would have also loved to do a food tour, but we just didn’t have the time.
Have a rough idea of the top 3–4 things you want to do/see/experience well in advance. There are so many advantages to planning ahead. In a lot of cases, you can pre-book entrance tickets and print them out at home to save yourself time and money. This is super critical in cases like visiting the Eiffel Tower. You’ll see tons of ads from private operators charging you the sun, moon and stars for a visit to the second-floor or summit. If you plan ahead (and here I literally mean a month or two ahead), you can pre-book your Eiffel Tower experience for a fraction of the cost AND you can skip the long wait lines. Through this official site, tickets to the second floor (with lift access) cost 16 euros per head — that’s about $18 USD. A quick search for a private-operator led tour on Viator shows that this same experience costs $52. We managed to book afternoon tickets to the second floor (lift access) through the official site and it was totally worth it.
Same thing for our tour of the Colosseum in Rome. I was hell bent on booking the underground tour (with access to the arena floor) because I knew how much G loved ‘The Gladiator’, but the private-operator led tours were outrageously expensive. Then, I stumbled on this helpful post in a forum which led to the Colosseum’s own booking portal. Again — you need to book these well in advance because they sell out super quick but if you’re lucky (like me) you can book this amazing experience for an super price!
Sign up for a walking tour (or two). We signed up for Sandeman’s FREE tour of Paris and enjoyed it so much that we signed up for a paid walking tour of the Montmartre neighbourhood the next day. These are often a couple of hours long, so make sure you wear comfortable clothing (preferably layers that you can take off/put on depending on the weather) and very comfortable footwear! Walking tours are simply the best way to see a place, and if you do them early on in your trip, you can decide on which places you may want to come back see in more detail. Plus, they’re pretty reasonably priced.
Pre-download free audio guide applications and content. Wherever we didn’t employ the services of a guide, we used Rick Steve’s free walking tour app on our iPhones. His audio guides are informative and interesting — for instance, I discovered (through one of content pieces in the Berlin walking tour guide) that Michael Jackson’s infamous ‘dangling baby’ incident happened at the balcony of a room at the Hotel Adlon just outside The Brandenburg Gate! The other smart decision we made was downloading all the apps and app content offered by The Palace of Versailles (including audio guides for the Trianons and the Gardens). You actually get an audio guide device with your ticket, but it’s a tiny recorder like device with no earphones and the apps actually have the same content but in better quality. Also, the audio guide offered with the ticket doesn’t cover the Trianons and Gardens. Another tip at Versailles? Buy a round trip ticket for the Petit Train. Otherwise, you’ll have to spend an inordinate amount of time walking from the Palace, across the gardens and grounds to the Grand Trianon and then the Petit Trianon.
And perhaps my most important piece of advice:
Choose your travel partner wisely. I’m incredibly lucky to have found a partner who loves discovering new things (be it food, drinks or experiences) at the same pace as I do. He gives me the lead to do the planning, and I thrive in this role :) And then he surprises me with things like spontaneous tickets to a show at the Moulin Rouge and so much more. So thank you, G, for being the amazing person that you are! Here’s to more adventures together ❤
Other little bits of advice:
> Figure out the tipping culture — carry a few Euros in change for this> Carry a small backpack with your water, an umbrella, sunscreen, your passport (safely tucked away), and some money (our credit cards worked everywhere) aside from other essentials (charger, tissues etc). Your bag will be screened at most attractions, so don’t carry too many electronics or too large a bag> Watch out for street vendors/hawkers trying to get you buy stuff by catching you off guard (like by giving you a high-five and shoving something into your hand)> Not every touristy thing is overrated. Case in point: the hot chocolate at Angelina in Paris. Walking down the Kurfürstendamm in Berlin. Eating gelato in Rome. The view from the second floor of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Snacking on currywurst and tucking into a schnitzel in Berlin. Looking up at the oculus in the Pantheon in Rome. The first view of the Sacré-Cœur as you walk up the hill in Paris. Everything about the Palace of Versailles ;)

Walking through the Rome Streets.
I promised in my previous article about our trip to Italy to write about each city in deeper thoughts and suggestions for a travel plan. First, as it was on a trip, I will write about Rome, then I hope you will also see articles about Florence and Venice.
If you read my travel articles, you know, I am very organized in planning and do my research very thoughtfully starting from the choices of areas and hotels to stay, tickets to museums and must visit places, reservations needed to try restaurants, gem spots, to learning the art and history of the place. It definitely takes time, and I am more than happy to share this knowledge with you.
Interested in my travel plans? Just email to see.feel.like@gmail.com. I will share them with you for free.
I said in my Planning Trip to Italy article, Rome was the city that still stands as an unclosed book and open to think about, and I am definitely willing to come back to see more and get deeper knowledge of this city.
My partner and I spent just 3 days in Rome, and I think it is a good amount of time for the first time traveling, especially if you are limited in time and want to see other regions and cities in your travel time.

One of my favourite travel writing clichés is “the city where East meets West!” I’ve seen it written about everywhere from Vienna to Hong Kong, St Petersburg to Tbilisi, Beirut to Berlin, and basically every decent-sized city in Central Asia. One of these days, I’m expecting to see a picture of Dublin with spice markets and mosques and the headline “Ireland — America’s Gateway to the Orient!”
But I have to admit that if it were to be used for anywhere, the city most deserving of the title would be Istanbul. Unlike most other claimants, Istanbul is split in two not just culturally, but geographically; the city straddles both Europe and Asia. This is a useful piece of pub quiz trivia, but also shaped the city for the past two millennia — Istanbul, for most of its history, was the most strategically important city on Earth.
2700 years ago, Greek explorers consulted the Oracle at Delphi, who told them that they would found a city opposite the Land of the Blind. When they came across the fishing town of Chalcedon, they couldn’t understand how the Chalcedonians had missed the perfect natural harbour right across the water. Then it came to them: these Chalcedonians must be the blind ones…

A Day in the Life:
When in Rome
First and foremost, if you have chosen to learn about life in Rome by reading this blog, thank you for taking the time to do so!
This region is home to my dream vacation. This is because one of my best friends, Beatrice, happens to be a Native of the region who lives there with her family. I met her during our senior year of high school (she was a foreign-exchange student) and we have been great friends communicating via Facebook and WhatsAp ever since. I promised her that some day I would go visit her in Rome…but for now, I am a college student attempting to make ends meet to pay for school, therefore, this blog is the closest I will get to Italy for a while. Regardless of my inability to pay the $1,000 for a plane ticket, this blog will give me the opportunity to study life in Rome so that I will know exactly what I would like to do the moment I step foot there.
My goals for this blog are both personal and involve you, as the audience. Like previously stated, I would like to learn more about the region in order to prepare myself for a future trip to visit Beatrice. On a larger scale, however, my goal is to help educate my followers through this blog so that if they plan to travel to Rome, are thinking about planning a vacation, or need an emergency get away from college/final exams, they will be adequately informed about the region.
If you know anything about Rome from your schooling, it is likely that you know Rome’s history is anything but brief. I will do my best to summarize it in a short paragraph or two for you.
Basically, Rome was one of the greatest empires there ever was- if looking at it from an ancient sort of perspective. As you can see from the timeline, Rome lasted a bit longer than the average civilization back in the day. This is largely due to the fact that Rome was home to many powerful leaders, conquerors, and other highly intelligent individuals. Just a few of these include: Ceasar (his war tactics are still studied and taught today), Augustus (built many roads, aqueducts, and buildings), and Mark Antony (had an intimate relationship with the Egyptian ruler Cleopatra-he stabbed himself for her, she let a snake bite her for him-it’s a long story for a different time). In summary, the Romans were a power you didn’t want to threaten or mess with. You would only be setting yourself up for defeat-unless, of course, you were the Franks from Germany who defeated them between AD 406–419.
So what is it with the Colosseum as a Roman symbol?
The Colosseum, as pictured at the top of this blog post, was built following the rule of Nero, an extra crazy ruler who basically ran the morale of the Roman peoples into the ground. The ruler who followed Nero, Vespasian, decided that building the Colosseum for the purpose of free entertainment (gladiator games) would benefit the people of Rome by bringing up their morale, and that it did.
Today, the Colosseum still stands with a few alterations and additions after its original design in approximately 73–75 A.D. It is noteworthy that the Roman architecture and design techniques used to build the magnificent building are still being used in various buildings in the modern world.
While ancient Roman culture is still evident in this amazing city, Rome has modernized itself to keep up with the current times. If one were to visit today, it would be something like…
Vatican City
Vatican City, while it is technically a city state and not a part of Rome, falls within the Roman boarder. It is home to approximately 840 people, one of those being the Pope, the leader of the Catholic Church. This city state also happens to contain some of the main tourist attractions in Rome including St. Peter’s Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, and the Vatican Museums.
Shopping
According to http://www.rome.info/shopping/, when one is shopping in Rome, they can expect to break the bank. One positive side to shopping in the tourist city, however, is that leather products such as purses, shoes, and belts, are commonly found for a fair price. (Being a purse-lover myself, I now know I need to save up for more than just my plane ticket!)
Another important thing to remember if you are used to the United States’ way of shopping is that the hours are generally a bit off from what you may be used to. Evidently, they open around 9:00AM and close again for lunch around 1:00PM. They then open up from 3:30PM-7:30PM. These hours are different, however, for Sundays and Monday mornings and may also be different depending on the type of shop.
*Note: If the purpose of your trip is heavily dependent upon the shopping, do not go to Rome during August. During this month, most shops and restaurants close for about a two week period while shop owners take their annual holiday.
Restaurants
Yes, Rome happens to be in Italy so you’re probably thinking, “Well duh! While in Italy, order Italian!” If you love spaghetti or pizza, then I can see why you would prefer to purchase the “real deal.” One thing I will tell you, however, is make sure to order some gelato for dessert!
Gelato, the Italian version of ice cream, is made with milk, cream, different sugars, and nut and fruit purees for flavor. Generally, the consensus is that gelato is amazing and American ice cream comes second. If you are a bit of a health nut like me, you will also be happy to know that gelato tends to contain less calories, fat, and sugar than typical ice cream.
According to http://www.expatfocus.com/expatriate-rome-language, the main language spoken in Rome is Italian. Luckily, if you are an individual who is not bilingual-like me-and English is your only language, Rome is a great place for you to travel to a different country without having to suffer the consequences of butchering a new language. (Go to Rome and you won’t have your friends laugh at you for accidentally ordering grilled guinea pig to pair with your pasta and side salad-it’s a thing!) This is because the people of Rome are aware that a large part of their economy depends on tourism so many of them living in the areas known for the tourist attractions speak English. In other words, as far as verbal communication goes you should be able to survive without hiring a translator.
If you do want to throw just a bit of Italian into your experience, however, feel free to say “ciao” (pronounced like “chow” in “puppy chow”). This means “hello” and can also translated to “goodbye,” depending on the context.
In terms of nonverbal communication, however, communicating in Rome is a different story. After spending much time with my friend Beatrice in high school, she became annoyed with my “silly American ways,” as she called them. According to her, Romans are very physical in a way that we Americans might see as boarder-line suggestive/sexual. Apparently, it is completely common to let your friends (male or female) sit on your lap when hanging out, give long hugs to friends, and the custom greeting (even with strangers) is a short embrace with a kiss on each cheek.
Another way the Romans communicate physically is by frequently motioning. Beatrice often coached me (as a bit of a joke) how to “speak with my hands.” If something is delicious, you indicate that with your hands because your mouth is full. If you want someone to hurry up, you tap your wrist like a watch. Basically if you want to go to Italy and your goal is to blend in, you had better learn the equivalent of sign language.
www.nytimes.com
As I sit here and finish up this blog post (while drinking a glass of wine from Italy ironically-Risata il Rosso-you should try it!), my final thoughts to you are this: if you ever want to learn about a country or a culture, the best way to go about it is to go there. Cultural immersion, as they call it, is essential to learning and life experience. While you might be held back by lack of funds or a chaotic schedule, I strongly suggest making a solid effort to get outside of your box. Force yourself to be uncomfortable but most importantly, go into any experience with an open mind. You won’t regret it.

Right at the beginning, I have to admit that I am part of the problem I am complaining about. We have visited Rome on a cruise, and I suspect that the explosion of cruise tourism has a significant role to play in the flood of tourists in Rome.
My wife and I booked the cruise almost eighteen months ago. At that time we were not yet aware of the problems caused by this form of tourism. Greta Thunberg was still an unknown student somewhere in Norway, and the cruise theme had not yet arrived in our consciousness.
Besides the vast CO2 emissions per passenger, the biggest problem of the cruise industry in Europe is the limited capacity of many ports of destination of the gigantic ships.
Places like Skala on Santorini, Venice, or Stavanger are regularly visited by large cruise ships with 2,000 to 4,000 passengers — sometimes several in one day.
Rome is not directly by the sea, but from the nearest port in Civitavecchia, large bus fleets with cruise ship passengers drive daily to the Italian capital.

I moved from one cultural landmark to another, trying not to get sunstroke. The morning started with a saving cup of coffee near Tivoli station. Then, a quick escape into the coolness of the cathedrals.
I was struck by the young men and women who sat alone in churches for long periods. Some knelt in prayer. Such beautiful, delicate bodies, already asking God for forgiveness for their indulgence in love.
Here, temptation came too easily.
Having feasted my eyes on the works of Raphael and Michelangelo, I looked around, searching for someone to channel this overwhelming creative energy into. Among the group of tourists stood a petite girl in a flowing white maxi skirt.
Her hair was darker than pitch, and her blue eyes closely followed the guide’s gestures. I noticed the delicate frame beneath her light white blouse.
She noticed me too. (Of course, I had been looking at her so intently!)
“It’s so wonderful to be here!” she said. “I’m an artist! I came to Rome for inspiration!”
She didn’t even need to say it. It was obvious.
She loved life the way the great painters of the Vatican did — Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Raphael Santi. Their works were a triumph of life itself. And standing before Peter Wenzel’s “Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden”, I realized — we were meant to meet here.
Feeling my desire to be closer, she quickly decided to make me her personal photographer to observe me better.
“Take a photo of me by that pinecone in the Cortile della Pigna!” she teased.
She posed and turned, again and again. It was obvious — I was already captivated.
Then she sighed:
“How will I go to the Villa Borghese alone now? Who will take my pictures?”
I was more than happy to go!
She sat in the metro as if in a sauna — flushed, damp, squeezed between two sturdy men pressing against her from either side. It was a new painting — her, in tight quarters, in the stifling heat.
But she looked only at me. Without blinking.
Melted by the art of the Borghese Gallery, she came alive. Several times, she leaned in, drowning me in the sweet scent of her perfume, explaining this or that masterpiece.
“Sacred and Profane Love” by Titian.
“Do you see how different they are, yet they share the same painting?” she asked.
I also found myself drawn to Correggio’s ‘Danaë’. Instinctively, I compared the beauty next to me to the legendary princess, draped in nothing but fate itself. From this perspective, Cranach the Elder’s ‘Venus and Cupid’ intrigued me as well.
Stepping outside, surrounded by the intoxicating scent of pine, she declared:
“Photograph me however you like!”
I wanted her to lie down on a stone bench, among the ancient Roman statues.
I hadn’t expected her to be so bold.
A true artistic soul. Intriguing was an understatement.
We dined at a café facing the Pantheon.
After the second glass of wine, she asked:
“Have you ever been in love?” (God, why do women always ask this question?)
I hesitated.
She downed her wine, clinked glasses with me in a brotherhood toast, and said:
“Let’s go for a walk!”
That night is impossible to forget.
By midnight, we realized that finding a taxi in Rome was nearly impossible. I felt like a gladiator, returning from a victorious battle, carrying her in my arms along the Roman Forum, nearly out of strength.
Her soft body could be traced through the gentle folds of fabric.
Strangely, she never let me kiss her that night.
Surviving, I left for Florence, but my mind stayed with her.
I visited its stunning cathedrals, the Uffizi Gallery, and Palazzo Pitti. My hotel room was small, but the bright moon watched over me, reminding me of her.
We often texted, and then, one day, she came — for half a day only.
This time, she looked different.
She realized that Florence and Rome were two entirely different worlds.
No longer dressed in white, but in deep blue.
Her hair, once tied in a tight bun, was now let loose, cascading like the curls of Botticelli’s Venus.
Every strand carried a message — an echo of past centuries, where every glance could become a masterpiece, every movement — art in itself.
Two days passed, but it felt like a lifetime. We walked a little.
“I think about you often,” I admitted.
“So do I,” she replied.
When I returned to Rome, I immediately arranged to meet her at the Spanish Steps.
She looked breathtaking in her evening dress and lace-up heels.
“By the way,” she said, “I was invited for a scooter ride across Rome tonight. But since you’re here, I want to spend the evening with you.”
Women love sitting in restaurants, don’t they? Have you ever noticed?
We ordered plenty of wine and braised pork in white wine.
At some point, her image started to blur in my mind, as if she had hypnotized me.
“God, I can’t keep up with you!” I admitted.
“Walk me to my hotel,” she said.
Her legs rested on the red leather couch.
Looking at me intently, she spoke about random things, but in reality, she was deciding the fate of the night.
How she decided — let that remain our little Italian secret.
What I can say is that Italy will always stay with me — vivid, alluring, unashamedly in love with life, gifting the world its greatest art: the art of love.

To meet WHO…? That was the question posed to me by my mother not but a day or two ago. I’d just explained my intention to treat this trip to Italy differently and make a few unfamiliar stops in a slow arc toward the Adriatic coast from Rome as opposed to the beeline I’ve been mapping religiously each visit this year. It must have seemed odd to have encouraged such wide-eyed curiosity from her.
Although I know I shouldn’t, I still find myself confused that others don’t share the love of solo travel (and especially withOUT plans) like I do.
So here I am now, at the initiation of day two in Italy, driving the hour from Poli, a small countryside village an hour outside of Roma to L’Aquila, a town in the smack center of the country, easily found by someone blindfolded and effectively the midpoint traversing from one coast to the other.
This morning as the sound of donkeys honking just outside my window nearly wake me, I choose to lay comfortably in bed a bit longer. After finally deciding to start my day remembering I’m alone in Italy — my “happy place” — I check my phone to learn I had managed to sleep in until 11:30 in the morning. Like a madman, I think for a moment the clock is wrong. I jump to freshen up and begin my saunter to the kitchen to find coffee before beginning the journey to my next adventure.
Day one was truly a reminder that going into travel with no expectations may be the best life hack ever invented. I selected my first night in Poli purely based on the fact that it was only an hour drive outside of where I would land in Roma Fiumicino. And I know from experience that the 3-hour drive to the coast is not exactly what I enjoy doing after an 8-hour redeye over the Atlantic. So I chose the house on the hill described as the “studio among the olive trees” from my AirBnB options. I had no idea what I was signing up for was joining a pseudo family for the night. I was greeted with offers to walk the donkeys, meet the dogs, the cat, and try foods I’d never seen in real life. I was given a private tour of a heart-stoppingly stunning municipal building covered in wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling watercolor-like frescoes by someone who clearly saw the interior only as an excuse for art.
Fully prepared to go out to dinner and eat alone that night, as I do quite frequently traveling through Italy by myself, I am delighted to receive an offer instead to join the family for dinner including a German friend stereotypically named Klaus. Recently in pensione, he had purchased and remodeled a villa/castle just up the road from where the couple lived. He is thrilled to have the opportunity to get back to English, a language that comes with fewer tongue ties than his intro-level Italian. We spend the evening eating chicory greens, oven-baked potatoes perfectly crisp, and some kind of delectable deconstructed meatballs so light they seem to melt in my mouth rendering chewing an obsolete ritual. We wash it down with a deliciously dry white wine from the Lazio region then a perfectly strong Grappa also from Lazio then, of course, no meal is complete without a shot of espresso. And just as I wonder whether this last sip could keep me up all night, I recall I had been traveling for over 24 hours, and everything would work out just fine.
This morning, as I wake nearly to the lunch hour, this time it is no surprise that I am invited to the adjacent kitchen to enjoy a breakfast cookie and coffee with my new family before hitting the road. I nibble on my flower-shaped homemade biscotti thinking how impossible it seems that they so easily disintegrate as they touch my tongue, overhearing conversations by the old gentleman on his phone discussing his methodology for recognizing whether or not mushrooms found in the local forests are safe and spicy or not. As he hangs up he gesture-explains the practice of taking a small nibble of mushrooms then rubbing them against his wrist as a test and how funny it is to watch people walking around biting and spitting down the line while hunting funghi through the woods.
I take my last mouthful of caffè and wish I could steal every recipe I can get my hands on. I’m told a quick story of a local cookie made only of flour, sugar, and wine and imagine war-time Italy as a nonstop show of Chopped, only better.
Reluctantly, I say my farewells, including at least 15 to 20 thank you’s and goodbyes. I promise a future stop that might involve my real family someday for the opportunity to sit down for a grand meal again. I step into my rental car and begin my exit as the automatic gate opens slowly in front of me. My phone connects to the Bluetooth and a song sets the tone for my travels. Sia sings to me that she has no dollar bills and loves cheap thrills. I giggle realizing I hadn’t spent a penny since arrival given the way my Italian hosts had taken me in and refused me to cover so much as the one euro glass of Prosecco we’d enjoyed as an aperitivo the night before. I smirk reflecting on the fact that having a lifestyle involving a solo trip to Italy more than four times a year is nothing short of luxury.
It’s a cloudy day and I begin my drive through the seemingly hand-chiseled road from Poli to the autostrada. My soundtrack turns to classical music as my phone shuffles to the next track. I imagine being in some sort of cheeky Italian car commercial… Pretty girl drives away speedily, stick-shifting through the Italian hillside as high energy strings harmonize in the background. A Lancia logo covers the scene and the tagline reads — You too can be an escape artist.
It’s nearly lunch now, even though I can still taste the coffee from moments ago. I am more than ready to clean a plate or two of whatever the next trattoria I find may be able to offer. I’ll stick to no expectations. All I know is that where I’m headed I’ve never been. And with no one I’ve ever met. Surrounded by things I’ve never seen. Stepping away someone I am not now.
Andiamo.

“From tourist to pilgrim”. This is an excellent name for a project organised by the Pantheon as a welcome service. I first visited Rome ten years ago as a reluctant tourist, fully aware that I was not ready explore its riches, and that the two days I had to spend there could not do it justice.
I return as a true pilgrim of Western Civilisation, its art and its history. Just like a pilgrim of days past, I must suffer long distances, pilfering conmen both small-scale and large, in a faraway, unfamiliar land, and deal with the vagaries of local cuisines like sugary croissants and exotic, unfamiliar pastas. Indeed it was only after travelling in Italy that I even realised what I had known as “Italian cuisine” hardly exists in Italy, with regional cuisines changing dramatically over just a few hours’ train journey.
I had spent so much time in the last decade reading about and watching documentaries and videos on Rome and its art, it was a strange feeling to physically walk across the Tiber on the Ponte Sant’Angelo surrounded by Bernini’s angels, gazing at della Porta’s dome of St Peter’s Basilica looming over the horizon.
The long straight sweeping boulevard makes for an imposing entry, with the view of the basilica and its dome bordered by the buildings on the side of that grand avenue. Surprisingly though, I thought it looked much smaller than expected upon reaching the Piazza designed by Bernini. As the Roman buildings fall behind and the symmetrical colonnades bracketing the vast piazza emerge, it is almost surprising to see the basilica does not extend further.
Perhaps this is an example of the mind’s tendency to exaggerate expectations of the dimensions of things it has held in high esteem, but the basilica feels dwarfed by the expansiveness of the piazza. Bernini’s use of space overshadows Michelangelo’s magnificent jewel box. Or perhaps this impact is due to the sweeping boulevard leading up to it, built by Mussolini in the age of the automobile. As one moves closer to the basilica and it looms larger, expectations crescendo, and it feels as though one is only looking at a part of it, and that the building must extend to the sides.
Once inside however, the dimensions reset, and the pilgrim is hit by the full force of the splendour of counterreformation Baroque in all its glory. It is a convincing utilisation of the power of art to dazzle 16th century Europe into accepting the Roman Church’s claims to divine authority.
St Peter’s basilica is ostensibly a shrine to the apostle Peter, or to God, or whatever the assertions of Catholic theology claim. To me, and I suspect to many modern visitors, this is a shrine to Bernini and Michelangelo, as well as the other saints of Baroque art whose genius adorns the basilica.
Is this the broader fate of churches in Europe? As the number of sincere worshippers in the pews dwindle and are replaced by tourists and pilgrims of art and history, churches are turning into living museums and art galleries. Many churches seem to be accepting of this trend, trying to indirectly monetise their art collections.
For example, the Church of St Ignatius Loyola has a mirror and coin-operated lights for visitors wanting to admire its dramatic, jaw-droppingly beautiful fresco. One would imagine the price of €1 for around 60 seconds of light, must be sufficient to pay for the maintenance of the fresco and perhaps other parts of the church. When I was there, there was even soft, calming spa music playing in the background. Bernini’s magnificent Ecstacy of St. Theresa also has a similar coin-operated lighting system though it is not absolutely necessary to admire the work.
At St Peter’s and other sites in Rome, I often thought of Sir Kenneth Clark’s quips and insights in his Civilisation documentary. I tried to follow the contours of Michelangelo’s basilica that “carries the eye round as if it were the carving of a torso”, though I could not get very far before being herded back to the constricted tourist path by an attendant.
The Sistine Chapel is still the holiest site of Western art, and therefore perhaps of Western Civilisation itself. The thrill of seeing in real life some of the most iconic images of the world continues beyond Michelangelo’s Creation of Man as one progresses on life’s journey through the world of art and literature.
Even if you know certain works of art live in certain museums or churches, there is still a thrill when you actually encounter them, since you never know precisely where in the museum or church they are, and their first sight is always a surprise. My highlight was stumbling upon Proust’s Odette de Crécy in Botticelli’s Life of Moses on the southern wall — the melancholy face of Zipporah that makes a suave, intelligent, highly eligible Parisian dandy fall in love with a courtesan because of her resemblance to the daughter of Jethro.
I fell in love with the Baroque in the Germanic lands and made the pilgrimage to Rome in large part to visit the birthplace of the Baroque, which was born out of the Catholic Church’s resolution to use the power of art to woo back worshippers to fight back against the Protestant reformation. I was amply rewarded with its many Baroque treasures, some more famous than others.
However, I was also surprised to discover I sometimes found it more difficult to enjoy the beauty of churches in Rome, for several reasons.
Firstly, it is more difficult to overlook the destructive role of early Christianity in classical Rome and its conflicts with paganism. The majestic ruins of the Roman fora are too close to not feel them stoically bearing witness to the desecration of their holy Pantheon, where even after 1,500 years the church feels like an invasive occupier, out of place in the naturalistic, circular architecture where the oculus offers nature-worshippers a direct communion with the sky. The niches of the dome once adorned with sculptures of pagan Roman deities look achingly empty.
This sense of loss is not felt in the Germanic baroque, perhaps because either there was nothing comparable before, or if there was, it has been lost to history. There are no churches built over destroyed temples to Thor that we know of, even if there were probably Roman temples in Vindobona, the Roman military camp that became Vienna.
After all, it was at the medieval church on Capitoline Hill nearby, where barefoot friars walked in the former temple of Juno, that Edward Gibbon was inspired to write The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.
My art pilgrimage trail took me from the Pantheon to Bernini’s fountain of the four rivers at the Piazza Navona, where I stumbled upon the basilica of St Agnes in Agone, another site whose history forces the visitor to remember the clash of early Christianity with European paganism. The baroque church is said to be built on the site of the tomb of the martyred saint, believed to have been tortured and killed by pagan Roman authorities.
Here I discovered the second reason why it can sometimes be more difficult to enjoy Roman baroque. At least in this instance, it is too transparent in its attempt to use the power of visual art to dazzle people into faith, and into submission to the authority of the Roman Church. The origin of baroque art was utilitarian, to be a tool of the counterreformation, but this seems to be one of its more crude and least convincing applications. Perhaps the Baroque had to go through these phases in its Roman birthplace before maturing into its more impressive stages. At St Agnes of Agone, a certain lack of sincerity, feeling, and faith seeps through the frescos of overly dramatic animated figures looking down at you with theatrically exaggerated emotions, matched by equally exaggerated expressions carved in marble in a grand and opulently designed space that exhibits the unmasked power and wealth of the so-called Catholic Church.
This is the third impediment to enjoying the Roman baroque: the flagrant corruption of the Roman church is so ubiquitous, it is impossible to avert one’s eyes from it in Rome. The Latin name of the Borgia family, which has become a byword for licentiousness and rapaciousness, “Borghesis”, is still vainly stamped across St Peter’s entablature (the technical term for the part below the pediment, the triangular gable). It makes it very difficult for any reasonable outsider to take its spiritual claims seriously, creating a dissonance with its aesthetic richness.
Palaces stamped with the names of royal families are de rigour and to be expected, but churches defaced with the names of aristocratic families?
Beauty, utility and politics
It must be one of the biggest hoaxes ever perpetrated in history. With a few exceptions, the papacy was held by the eminent Italian aristocratic families of the day, who successfully fooled all of western Europe for 300 or years, and southern Europe for another 300 odd years, into believing their claims to divine authority, in addition to the temporal authority they held as wealthy noblemen and princes, wearing not merely a crown and commanding armies, but also claiming to be the divinely-ordained representative of Christ on earth.
It is a hoax that is humoured even today by the legal and diplomatic recognition of 44ha of the Roman neighbourhood surrounding St Peter’s, as a sovereign nation state, simply because the Roman church still refuses to accept the authority of any government, and has too many devoted followers all around the world that governments need to appease.
Render unto Caesar what belongs to Caesar? Not the pope, who is still Caesar in his own microstate, which has its own train station and postal service, and where visitors without a ticket or special dispensation are only allowed as far as Bernini’s piazza and, if you ask the border guard nicely, one small street to visit a church. Countries still spend taxpayer funds maintaining embassies specifically to the Vatican, which visitors pass by on their way. Admittedly, it would be a rounding error for countries like Canada or the United Kingdom, but surely, Nigerian taxpayer funds can be better spent than on renting an office and employing staff to maintain a separate mission to the Holy See, in addition to the embassy to Italy. The Roman Catholic Church remains the only religious denomination in the world to control its own territory legally beyond the reach of any nation state.
This confrontation with the historical context of the Baroque forces me to examine my own attraction to it.
Although many centuries and a culture removed from the target audience of illiterate European peasants the art was targeted at to win over their hearts and minds , I must confess, I have always wanted to be dazzled by the power of art unleashed by the Catholic Church.
Admiring the awe-inspiring fresco of St Ignatius Loyola, I consider, why not? What’s wrong with wanting to have one’s eyes caressed by such extravagant beauty?
The mind protests nonetheless: did the Roman Church not effectively abuse art and its power to pursue its own political power? Was it that different to the propaganda of unsavoury regimes in world history? Or perhaps the use of convincing, alluring imagery used by cigarette companies in their advertising, like Marlboro Man?
Perhaps.
However, I would argue that the effect of good Baroque art, and its ability to stir awe and something deeper in us even today, shows that at a certain level, the power of art is one that cannot be controlled for human ends — it stays with the art as an independent force, regardless of who unleashed it, or their motives.
Perhaps the artist, the creator, is more like a shaman able to invoke the spirit, the life force that true art is. Once unleashed, it retains its own power regardless of the shape it has been given, the identity of the shaman-artists or their intentions. True beauty, and the art that bears it, transcends such worldly matters.
Beauty cannot be intellectualised, rationalised or indeed even moralised, and neither can the best exemplars of art, which can sometimes almost become synonymous with beauty. It was an inspired decision for a religious authority like the Catholic Church to use this transcendental power of art to give their believers a glimpse into the afterlife.
In truth, the theology behind the art does not really matter, nor do the stories being told by the art. Rather, it is in the emotional effect these works of art have on the viewer, that the power of art lies, and which transcends the artist, patron and their motives and beliefs.
It is true that experiencing this power may have convinced many a German or Italian peasant of the very legitimacy of the political power of the Catholic Church, and helped to gloss over its corruption.
Nonetheless, I can experience the same power centuries later as a pilgrim of art, and get a glimpse into the Transcendent, or in the words of Baudelaire, get an “inkling of the glories that lie beyond the grave.”
Western Civilisation as the Rises and Falls of Romes
Climbing Michelangelo’s staircase to the top of Capitoline Hill, one takes in a landscape drenched in history. Elegant domes of Baroque churches seem to rise phoenix-like from the vast Roman ruins, which “even after three centuries in which they were used as quarries, and in which our sense of scale has expanded, they still are surprisingly big.”
As the heart of the ancient Roman Empire, Capitoline Hill has retained its mystique through the centuries as a symbolic focal point of Western Civilisation, especially in its political manifestations. Even today, its memories linger on symbolically in almost every modern Western nation.
Monarchs through the last two millennia have styled themselves after the Roman Emperors, depicted with laurel wreaths in portraits, including on modern coins struck in the name of Queen Elizabeth II. German and Russian emperors literally called themselves Caesar (i.e. Kaiser and Tsar in their languages) until 1918, and Germany even called itself the Holy Roman Empire until 1806, despite never actually ruling Rome. Roman eagles are still the symbols of governments from Russia to Poland, Germany, France, and the United States of America, the republic which openly modelled itself on Rome, even building its own Capitol Hill.
Trajan’s Column stands nearby, and I notice its similarity to the column in what I think is Paris’s most beautiful and certainly most storied town “square”, Place Vendome. To digress, it is technically an octagon, and Chanel’s watches pay homage to its shape. The original Trajan column in ancient Rome had a statue of Emperor Trajan, which at some point went missing and was replaced by a statue of St. Peter. Meanwhile Napoleon’s likeness still stands atop the Vendome column, dressed as an ancient Roman emperor, crowned with laurels.
Outside the world of power and politics, even Lufthansa calls one of the premium tiers of its loyalty program “Senator”. The list of Rome’s influence on the modern world goes on.
Rome is truly the eternal city. Arguably the ruins and the inspiration of their legacy are as historically significant as the empire itself. Ever since Rome, every time a Western polity rose to greatness or sought to project greatness in the eyes of the world, it did so in the garb of Rome. In some ways then, the story of Western Civilisation is the story of successive rises and falls of Romes in different parts of Europe and North America.
Today, it is possible to survey the sweep of history at the Capitoline hill in Rome and behold the eras that have left their signatures in the language of architecture, in this vast open-air guestbook of Time.
The sheer scale of ruins from antiquity are indeed awe-inspiring, and it is perhaps not difficult to empathise with the many generations who have felt dwarfed by its achievements. According to Christopher Clark, the people of the dark ages were crushed by the scale of the ruins left behind by the Roman Empire and could not believe they were the work of men, treating them as natural phenomena “like mountains, and built their huts in them, as who should take advantage of a ravine or sheltering escarpment”.
The achievements of antiquity continued to weigh on artists like Henry Fuseli into the late 18th century, as expressed in his drawing The Artist’s Despair Before the Grandeur of Ancient Ruins, depicting the colossal hand of Constantine found in the Capitoline museum.
The early Christian era is represented on Capitoline Hill by the cavernous but in the grand scheme of churches not especially impressive, Romanesque Basilica of Santa Maria in Ara Coeli, where inspiration struck Gibbon to write his Decline and Fall.
The most beautiful part of the Capitoline Hill is still Michelangelo’s circular piazza with its hypnotising, almost tantric pattern around it, and the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius standing in the middle, the “only one ancient Emperor to remain above ground in the sunshine through the centuries”.
Michelangelo’s piazza and its humanist dimensions shows the confidence of the giants of the Renaissance, who “bursting with vitality and confidence, were not in a mood to be crushed by antiquity. They meant to absorb it, to equal it, to master it.”
Its timeless elegance, and the simplicity of its humanist splendour maintain a quiet dignity despite being overshadowed by the most recent attempt of an era to leave its mark on the Capitoline Hill, the enormous Vittoriano monument from the late 19th and early 20th century.
It still physically dominates the landscape today, newer, bigger and shinier than Michelangelo’s piazza. But in the topographical history book that is Rome, it can also look like a signpost of the wrong turn that Western Civilisation took in the late 19th century, which paved the way to the catastrophes of the 20th.
The historicist Vittoriano certainly houses many works of beauty and is like a modern rendition of an enormous marble Roman temple, dedicated to the Italian fatherland. However, it relies a bit too heavily on size to assert dominance and demand visual attention, perhaps revealing the insecurity and brashness of the late 19th century and its newly unified Italian state that first commissioned it. A cynic may even argue it was an attempt to make up in sculpture for Italy’s failures in the battlefield.
Perhaps I am too much in thrall to 19th century Italy’s arch rival, the Habsburg Empire (see my love letter to Vienna). Despite my deep love of Italy’s culture, history, language, cuisine and its people, I have always struggled to extend that awe to its history as a modern nation state.
“Great nations write their autobiographies in three manuscripts: the book of their deeds, the book of their words and the book of their art. Not one of these books can be understood unless we read the two others, but of the three the only trustworthy one is the last”, wrote John Ruskin.
Italy’s book of its art is the finest in Europe and perhaps the world, but if my Italian friends can forgive me for saying so, the book of its deeds is a bit less impressive
For much of its modern history, Italy lay at the crossroads of rival European powers and was always governed by a multitude of political entities, with the North often a political chessboard where the great French-Austrian rivalry played out. Metternich famously described Italy as merely a geographical expression.
Ultimately, Italy could achieve unification only as a fortuitous by-product of French and especially Prussian campaigns to weaken the Austrian Empire, with most of their own military attempts ending in failure.
What should a visitor make of the Vittoriano? It is an altar to the fatherland in the form of a memorial to Vittorio Emanuele II, whose enormous equestrian statue takes centre stage, echoing that of Marcus Aurelius in the neighbouring piazza. The Savoyard monarch became the first king of a unified Italy in 1867, but this required assistance from both France, as well as Prussia, who defeated the Austrians in the faraway Silesian plains of Königgratz. As a result, they had to cede the parts of the Veneto region they had successfully defended against the Italians until then.
Ignoring the technicality that Italy has never truly unified because of the hole in its capital city from the Vatican insisting on its temporal sovereignty, the unified Kingdom of Italy only lasted 79 years, a split second in Roman historical terms, before the monarchy was abolished in a relatively close referendum in 1946, with the republicans winning 54% of the vote, mostly in the wealthy north of the country. The king was exiled, and his male descendants were forbidden from entering the country until 2002. Within another half century or so since the referendum, Italy was subsumed into the European Union, where nationalism has become a bit of a dirty word in polite society.
The prominence of the nationalistic Vittoriano on the Capitoline thus seems somewhat out of proportion with its historical relevance in the grand scheme of Roman history. A modern glass lift takes you to a terrace with magnificent views of the Coliseum, and from its top, the visitor can also admire the many domes of Papal Rome including St Peter’s across the Tiber.
With the full sweep of Western political history presented topographically in the mind of the visitor, the Vittoriano comes across as a colossal altar to a temporary burst of a very confused Italian nationalism that lurched somewhat schizophrenically between clericalism, monarchism, republicanism and with the EU, supranationalism.
The contrast is even stronger next to the lucid, harmonious expression of the timeless humanism of the Renaissance. It is worth remembering humanism is centred on the human being, and its architecture is dimensioned accordingly to accomodate humans, not to overwhelm them.
The mortal remains of Vittorio Emanuele II are buried in the ancient Pantheon, in royal tombs which are still guarded by an honour guard wearing cloaks bearing the royal coat of arms of pre-1946 Italy. By good fortune I found myself at the Pantheon on a day the guards of the royal tombs were celebrating an event, and caught a glimpse of the man who would be crown prince. He approached the Pantheon to the jubilant strains of the Royal March trumpeted by uniformed bands playing the erstwhile national anthem of Italy.
The prominence and scale of the Vittoriano would be much more coherent if the Italians had kept their monarchy in some form.
The Compost Heap of History
After some time in Rome, as you explore the ruins and discover and understand more and more layers of its history, it begins to weigh on you. You feel the weight of Rome as “the compost heap of history”, as described by Sir Clark.
You know you are just another one of the countless humans to have trod down these same roads and piazzas that have been around for longer than mankind can remember. You are merely the topsoil of the compost heap, that too for a blink of an eye before being buried by the future. The weight of countless centuries and their achievements impose upon the individual not only his own inconsequentiality, but even that of his entire era.
The era your lifetime affords you a glimpse of is but a tiny fraction of time in this city’s history. That too shall pass, and it will not be remembered as the era that saw the rise of Rome, the pinnacle of its civilisation, its fall, its trough, or its rebirth in the Renaissance. It is not even the era of the rediscovery of the rebirth, which inspired fresh waves of art and creativity.
You know you are walking in the shadows of Goethe on his Roman trip, who walked in the shadows of Winckelmann, the father of art history who poetically described his rapture at ancient Greek sculptures in the 18th century and held them to be the highest ideal of art.
You are dwarfed even by Rilke dismissing the reverence of Roman antiquity and its hold on the imagination, complaining more than a hundred years ago, of Rome and:
“the lifeless and drear museum-like atmosphere it breathes, the abundance of fragments of the past (on which a tiny present nourishes itself), that have been fetched out of the ground and laboriously maintained, the unspeakable excess of esteem, nourished by academics and philologists with the help of run-of-the-mill tourists, given to all these disfigured and spoilt objects which after all are the vestiges of another age and of a life that is not our own and can never be.”
Knowing all this, is originality even possible? Or is human history just endless cycles of repetitions of the same impulses, emotions and ambitions, with only the dates and costumes changing?
Wondering how many of the masses understand the significance of what they are clicking away at with their phones, and confronting the shallowness of your knowledge even after this pilgrimage, it can be easier to sympathise with the eras that felt crushed by antiquity, than to be inspired by the Renaissance.
But then again, “the story of Western Civilisation is one of rebirths, so we should be encouraged.” And so we await the next rebirth, hunched over our phones.
After the cataclysms of the 20th century, which the Vittoriano reminds us of, it will likely be many more years before modern Europeans can rediscover the confidence let alone the creativity, and dare I say, spirituality, to launch the next Renaissance.
My pilgrimage remains incomplete. I know there is still much I don’t know about Rome, its history, and its art treasures, many of which I was unable to see this time, and many more whose existence I don’t yet know of, waiting to be discovered, and perhaps even more whose existence I will never know in this lifetime…
“The physical pain and the nobility of soul are distributed with equal strength over the entire body and are, as it were, held in balance with one another. Laocoon suffers, but he suffers like Sophocles’ Philoctetes; his pain touches our very souls, but we wish that we could bear misery like this great man.”
— Johann Joachim Winckelmann, Reflections on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture, 1755

In 2015, I celebrated my 60th birthday. I’m a sucker for celebrating milestone birthdays, so I decided it was time to take a Mediterranean cruise. I love cruising; I had already experienced cruises to Alaska and New England. And I knew from my previous trips to Italy, Germany, and Prague that I also loved Europe. So, I thought, why not meld the two with a European cruise.
I convinced my husband that I deserved to go on this cruise (which I did) and that we would start in Rome, and we’d also visit Athens and Istanbul, among other port towns and cities. I had previously visited Rome for about a week, but my husband had never been there, so we decided to spend a day in Rome before the cruise ship disembarked.
Well, the cruise ship doesn’t take off from Rome but from the port town of Civitavecchia, about an hour away from Rome. This trip represented a splurge, to say the least, so my husband decided we would take the train from Rome to Civitavecchia to save $100. When I told one of my well-traveled co-workers that we would take the train from Rome to Civitavecchia, he told me to make sure and watch out for gypsies.
I could tell he was somewhat serious, but at the mention of gypsies, my thoughts immediately turned to a Carmen-type character with hoop earrings, jet black hair, and flowing scarves and skirts…

Rome. The Eternal City. Roma Urbs Aeterna in Latin. Where do I start this article? I have been to Rome 3 and a bit times now, the bit being a day trip from Sorrento in 1997, the longer visits in 1974, 2017, and 2023. In total about 26 days. That is nowhere near enough to see everything. But I won’t start with Rome itself. I will start with Alan Sugar, Lord Sugar, the billionaire director/owner of over 20 companies, and the host of the BBC programme The Apprentice.
Why Lord Sugar in a talk on Rome? Well in July 2023 Lord Sugar went to Pompeii. On July 9th 2023 on Twitter, or X to give it its new moniker, he told his followers ‘Visit to Pompei. Glad I went there but once you have seen one old wall you seen them all’. Now if you have ever read Lord Sugar’s posts on Twitter/X, you soon realise that he does not always take kindly to disagreement or criticism. He can be a little abusive sometimes. I felt I had to say something, but not welcoming an insulting reply, I cautiously replied ‘Really?’. I’m glad to say that was that.
My brief careful reply indicates I do not agree with his sentiment. Why? Because I openly admit that when it comes to Roman walls and other remains from Greek and Roman times, I am a total nerd. An enthusiast my kinder friends would say, but, yes, a nerd.
By way of example, in July 2023 I finally made it to a couple of places in England I have wanted to visit for some time, Maryport and Bowness on Solway in Cumbia. At Maryport the remains of the fort and vicus are lumps and bumps in a field of sheep. There is an excellent museum, the best collection of altars in Britain apparently, and a replica signal tower. Oh, and a signpost telling us we were only 1147 miles from Rome as the crow flies. A short morning stroll maybe?
There is even less to see at Bowness On Solway, everything has gone. The village church is partly built from Roman masonry. But it is the west end of Hadrian’s Wall and I had never been west of Carlisle before. I will say the views over the Solway Firth are magnificent, and driving along the old road towards Carlisle, now known as Cycle Route 72, you are following the line of the wall as well as noting bits of ditch and vallum here and there. Also the occasional building with a chunk of Roman stone in the wall. It is a lovely drive, and the views are wonderful. But definitely a journey for a nerd. It is a fair way from my home in Warrington, and not the best of roads once you leave the M6, which is often not much good either.
So this is the first of a number of articles/chapters on some of the sites in and around Rome itself, which do not always feature in the average guide book. But I hope they will be of interest to more than Classical History nerds like me.
I have a document on my computer. It is known to a very small number of friends with a similar interest as ‘The List’. Nothing sinister, a list of ‘things’ in Rome and the surrounding areas we haven’t seen yet or haven’t seen everything there. ‘Things’ get added to ‘The List’ if I read about them or see a mention of them on the internet. So when we went in May 2023 ‘The List’ helped us plan what to do each day.
I suspect I would need to spend about 6 months in Rome to exhaust ‘The List’ and I know I never will. It is far from comprehensive and contains huge structures and single columns or fragments. There are bits of ancient Rome all over the city and new things come to light all the time. Is there an exhaustive list somewhere? I guess the Italian archaeology authorities have one. Some English books have a good go, but they don’t contain everything. In any case, the majority of visitors only have time for the well-known sites, not the more obscure stuff that interests me as much as the big sites. Being realistic you are looking at a year or two to see everything.
Having acknowledged that, you sometimes find that these sites not on the standard ‘must see’ list have an interesting story attached to them. Seeing and investigating something that many people have never heard of, or have seen mentioned on a documentary can tell you something new about the history of Rome, or the lives of the people who lived there from the city’s founding in the Iron Age to its fall around 1200 years later.
So, if you are exploring Rome and its neighbourhood in the 21stC AD, what do you need? Decent footwear and a hat for starters. A smart phone with Google Maps (or similar) is very handy too. For a guidebook with a difference, look for books by Louis F Aulbach and Linda C Gorski in the series Rome In Ruins — Self Guided Walks. Another book to use, but rather too bulky to carry round is Rome, An Oxford Archaeological Guide by Amanda Claridge. Finally once there, go to a tobacconist or the Termini Railway station, and get a runaround Atac transport ticket for bus, tram, metro, and local trains. At 24 euros for 7 days (2023 price), a bargain.
You may have already been to Rome and seen the major sites, possibly a lot of the minor ones too. Who has visited the Imperial Forums? The Colosseum? The Circus Maximus? The Palatine Hill? The Baths Of Caracalla? The Pantheon? Trajan’s Column? Not to mention less ancient sites like The Vatican? The Spanish Steps? The Trevi Fountain?
Maybe the Saepta Julia? The Basilica Of Neptune? Yes? No? Ok, well this is where the less well-known sites come into their own. But, if you visited the Pantheon, well, maybe you just passed by the Saepta Julia, and the Basilica Of Neptune without realizing. Most people do. I did on previous visits up till May 2023.
So where is the Saepta Julia? What is it? Well, it is on the left hand side of the Pantheon (from the front), on Via della Minerva. The remains are lower than the street level. Watch out for the traffic and look over the wall. The Saepta was planned by Julius Caesar around 54 BC, and finished by Agrippa in 26 BC. The building was initially intended to be used as a voting place for both the Comitia Centuriata, and the Comitia Tributa. These are 2 assemblies established during the Roman Republic. However, in between the time of its planning and completion, the Roman Republic fell, Julius Caesar was assassinated.
After Caesar’s assassination, Lepidus, a member of the ‘Second Triumvirate’ with Octavian (Augustus) and Antony, continued managing the project, and it was completed by Augustus’s right hand man, Agrippa in 26BC. The design was a quadriporticus, an open square with a colonnade on all 4 sides. It was 310 m long, and 120m wide. It was embellished with Travertine marble.
Under Augustus a voting hall was less of a priority, and the Saepta was repurposed for gladiatorial combat (no Colosseum or large arena at this point), and also a meeting point for the senate, as the new Senate House had only just been completed. It was also used for naumachia, arena based mock ship battles, in the reigns of Augustus and Caligula. After his military successes in Germany, Tiberius was ‘presented’ to the people in the Saepta at the end of his triumphal parade. Later the building was used as a market for luxury goods, depicted as such in the Lindsey Davis Falco and Albia novels. In the Great Fire of Rome in 80AD the building was destroyed. Reconstruction commenced soon afterwards, possibly just before Domitian’s reign, and further restoration took place under Hadrian. The Pantheon next door was also badly damaged in the fire, and rebuilt in Trajan or Hadrian’s reign, including the amazing dome. That is why on the front of the Pantheon, the inscription refers to it being built by Agrippa, even though most of the building is from a later time. No-one is sure why. Was Hadrian paying a compliment to Agrippa? If you have Discovery Channel check an episode of Blowing Up History, strangely entitled ‘Mystery Of The Volcano Temple’ about that. We know from a slave collar that the Saepta was still in use in the 4th C AD but after that there is no further mention in recorded history.
The visible remains of the Saepta are of the Porticus Argonautarum. It is named after the artwork it depicted, which showed Jason and the Argonauts. Little remains of the rest, and it is all under later buildings and the street. The layout is known from the ancient map of Rome, the Forma Urbis Romae, which went back on public display on the Caelian hill this January. Incidentally, that will have to be added to ‘The List’. Also note how ground level has changed. The Saepta seems on level ground, and yet the Via della Minerva runs uphill.
So to demonstrate what can be learned from small sites like this site that most people walk by — some very famous Romans involved in it — Julius Casear, Lepidus, Augustus, Agrippa, Tiberius, Caligula, Hadrian; the Great Fire of Rome; gladiatorial shows and naumachia, and commerce. You can learn a great deal from small ruins.
Round the back of the Pantheon on the quiet Via della Palombella are the remains of what is thought to be the Basilica of Neptune. The Basilica was built around 25BC to celebrate the Battle of Actium. The building was destroyed in the same 80AD fire that hit the Pantheon and the Saepta Julia. As per those buildings, final restoration took place in Hadrian’s reign. Most of the remains are under the building on the other side of Via della Palombella.
Again, the remains are at a lower level than the current street. The uncertainty about the identification of the building is that the Baths Of Agrippa and a few other nearby buildings were also destroyed in the fire, and the reconstruction may have combined the buildings. The visible remains are from Hadrian’s time and consist of a brick wall, 2 niches and an apse framed by two columns. It is also difficult to distinguish the wall from the back of the Pantheon. It is hard to say if they were literally adjoining or adjacent. But clearly in ancient Rome, some buildings were literally cheek by jowl. No wonder one fire spread rapidly and took out so many buildings.
Carrying on westwards along the Via della Palombella, you come to Via di San Eustachio. There are two large red granite columns and a fragment of architrave from the Baths Of Nero. The Baths were built around 62AD and were located west and north of the Pantheon. The columns, and a basin not far away off the Via della Dogana Vecchia, have been relocated. The baths were 190m by 120m in size, so quite a size, and were the first known imperial bath complexes in Rome. The baths underwent significant repairs and renovation around 227AD in the reign of Alexander Severus.
We know very little about the Temple of Isis, which was in this area. The location is not known either, but it is assumed to have been somewhere east and south of the Pantheon, A coin of Vespasian survives depicting it. We have also have a couple of obelisks which were brought from Egypt. The Macuteo Obelisk adorns the popular fountain in the Piazza della Rotunda. It was from the Temple of Ra erected by Ramses II in Heliopolis. It is thought it was brought to Rome in Domitian’s reign. It has been relocated twice, the current re-erection being in 1711 by Pope Clemente XI. Nearby in the Piazza della Minerva is the Minerveo obelisk, now sitting on top of an elephant sculpture carved by Gian Lorenso Bernini. It was placed there in 1667. The obelisk came to Rome in Diocletian’s reign. The obelisk was originally erected by Pharaoh Apries of the 26th Dynasty about 580 BC, in his capital Sais.
From the Forma Urbis Romae mentioned previously we know that the Serapeum was also east and south of the Pantheon. On a corner of a small side street on the Via di Pie di Marmo, or Marble Foot Street (yes, not a joke) is, as you may guess, a giant marble foot. Given the location where it was found, the foot is thought to be from a statue of Serapis, the partner of Isis. The cults of Isis and Serapis were brough to Rome at the start of the 1st C BC, having already been established at Greek and Italian tribal cities in southern Italy 200 years earlier. Temples to Isis and Serapis were first planned by the 2nd Triumvirate, but we know the Isis temple was destroyed by Tiberius during the reign of Augustus. Caligula of all people restored the Temple of Isis, and Vespasian later enhanced both temples. But the same fire of 80AD which destroyed so many buildings in the area also destroyed them both. In the reign of Domitian the Temples of Isis and Serapis were rebuilt. Domitian also commissioned a copy of an Egyptian obelisk which has an inscription proclaiming him ‘beloved of Isis’. That obelisk is now in the Piazza Navona, which I will come to shortly.
So within a short distance of the world famous Pantheon, which everyone flocks to, are much smaller remains which also tell the story of Rome, and are worth checking out. I haven’t covered them all either, there are more bits and pieces to check if I go again. That isn’t to diminish the Pantheon. It really is remarkable, and worth joining the queue to get inside. Just after we visited, admission charges were introduced, but if that helps with the upkeep, then no-one should complain.
The Piazza Navona is a famous open area in Rome. It is the shape of a stadium, because the buildings around it sit on the footprint of Domitian’s Stadium. We stayed near there in the Navona Palace Luxury Inn. Our taxi driver dropped us at the rather plush Palazzo Navona instead but that’s another story. When we got to the Navona Palace we wondered what on earth we had booked. It looks bleak. The reception area is tiny. But the rooms, wow, never had one so big before, large lounge, bedroom, bathroom, lots of storage, unlike the little wardrobes most hotels give you.
Anyway, it is a short walk back to the Piazza Navona. There are 3 fountains in the Piazza. The main one in the middle was built by Bernini and is called ‘La Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi’, the Fountain of the Four Rivers, the four statues representing the Danube (Europe), Ganges (Asia), Nile (Africa) and Rio de la Plata (Americas). Domitian’s obelisk adorns the overall statue. It was moved there from the Circus Of Maxentius on the Appian Way — the emperor Maxentius had moved it there. By the way, one of the restaurants in the Piazza is called 4 Fiumi after the statue, I can recommend it.
At ground level it is not that easy to see that the Piazza Navona is built on top of a Roman stadium. The overall shape is a clue, as would be the curvature of the buildings at the north end if the tarpaulins and the giant electric Samsung sign were not there. Domitian’s stadium was opened in 86AD, as part of an Imperial building programme in the area following the fire of 80AD which destroyed so many buildings. It held around 30,000 spectators. So rather less grand than the much better-known Circus Maximus, which can be seen today between the Palatine and Aventine hills. That held well over 100,000 spectators. Today of course, it is just an open park. Whatever masonry remains is waterlogged underground, and difficult to excavate. It didn’t help that the last structure there was Rome’s main gas works. But it does lend itself to big events, a Bruce Springsteen concert was due there the day after we left.
Domitian’s stadium’s substructures and support frames were made of brick and concrete, and clad in marble. The facades would have resembled the Colosseum; the floor plan was a scaled down version of the Circus Maximus, having a similarly semi-circular end. The total stadium length was around 275m, and the total width around 106m.
The Stadium was used almost entirely for athletic contests, apart from the early 3rd C AD, when it was used for gladiator shows while the Colosseum underwent fire damage repair. The stadium went of use in later Imperial times and probably became living quarters for poor people after the sack of Rome. Today you can visit a small part of the structure underground. The entrance is on the Via di Tor Sanguinga. You can see the stadium entry portico, stairs to the seating area, and arched arcades, as well as a collection of finds, and sculptures.
There is a single column in the Piazza dei Massimi just south of the Piazza Navona. It is the only visible remains of the Odeon of Domitian. Domitian’s was the first Odeon in Rome. An Odeon is a building of Greek origin and is a smaller building than a classical theatre, with a similar design. Hence the word was adopted by a well-known cinema chain in the 20thC. The column was discovered during excavations in 1936–37. The column is not in situ; it was re-assembled in 1950 and placed here as close as possible to where it is believed the Odeon’s location was. The column may have been from the scaena of the Odeon. A nearby Renaissance building, the Palazzo Massimo, has a curved shape, and it is thought it was built on the remains of the Odeon.
As an emperor Domitian gets very bad press. He was cruel and paranoic, always in fear of plots and assassination, and in the end that happened. Nevertheless, the scale of the rebuilding begun in his reign after the fire of 80AD does at least give him some credit. Many of the building remains that we can see in this area of the Campus Martius today are from structures started in his reign.
The area of the Campus Martius between and including the Piazza Navona and the Pantheon are an ideal place to start an exploration of Ancient Rome, both the well known structures and the small one. If you enjoyed this article, please look out for the rest. You can use the link below.

Just got back from Rome and wow — my design brain is buzzing. Living in London, I’m no stranger to great design and rich history, but Rome? Rome hits differently. I expected great pizza and pretty ruins — I didn’t expect to come home with a camera roll full of ancient typography, delicious textures, perfectly imperfect symmetry, and more colour palettes than a Figma project on deadline. Let’s be real — Rome is basically a giant open-air museum. But for designers? It’s like stepping into a full-on, living Pinterest board. Every alley, every crumbling wall, every café sign — pure inspiration.
From carved serifs on marble buildings to the delightfully OTT signage in Vatican gift shops, the city is basically a love letter to type. Roman capitals? Still iconic. No wonder they’re the foundation of so many modern fonts we use today. I found myself zooming in on inscriptions like they were rare design references — because honestly, they kind of are.
Terracotta walls, sage green shutters, creamy marble, soft pink sunsets — Rome lives in warm tones. Even the shadows feel romantic. I caught myself saying “this could be a brand identity” about actual buildings. The harmony of age, weathering, and sunlight creates a vibe you just can’t fake.
What really stood out? Rome isn’t pristine — it’s layered. It’s textured, chipped, mismatched. But that’s the magic. The clash of modern posters on centuries-old stone, graffiti tagging beside Renaissance fountains — it’s chaotic, it’s real, and it works. I’m taking that energy into my next project: less polish, more personality.
Rome’s layout is wild — a little chaotic, slightly confusing, but totally delightful. It’s like navigating a designer’s brain: nonlinear, surprising, but everything somehow fits. You wander and suddenly stumble on a tiny design gallery, a hidden vintage shop, or the most photogenic door you’ve ever seen. That randomness reminded me that not every journey (UX or otherwise) needs to be overly mapped out — sometimes, discovery is the design.
I went to Rome planning to eat my weight in pasta (and trust me, that’s saying something), but I ended up gaining so much more — a fresh appreciation for storytelling, bold contrasts, and embracing a little creative chaos. If you’re a London-based designer feeling stuck, I highly recommend hopping on a plane and getting lost in Rome’s visual magic. It’s a city that fills not just your sketchbook, but your soul too.
Oh, and don’t forget to pack an extra tote — those pasta dishes and vintage posters are absolutely irresistible.

Finally, after six years of not entering an airplane, my husband and I went for ten days to Italy. And as I write these words, English sounds like a bizarre language to me, so read this while picturing an Italian person speaking English with an Italian accent because that’s me right now.
We made a hell of a trip because we tried to see a lot of the country in ten days, which left us exhausted even if it was awesome.
We visited Lake Como, Milan, Le Cinque Terre, La Spezia, Pisa, Florence and Rome.
I will be writing a series of articles about each place in the following days. The dos and don’ts of this trip; how to plan your trip, where to eat and where not to eat, how to book trains and some extra information.
But this introductory article starts with one minor detail about Rome — and in short…

Exploring Ancient Rome to Design a Public Space
Ancient Rome is a topic on everyone’s minds at some stage of their lives… nearly at least haha. Well, today I will go into detail on how we can study it and look back at examples to create a lovely civic space that might not completely represent Rome but holds their principles.
Ancient Rome is said to have been around since before Jesus Christ and up until the medieval ages that then transitioned into Christianity. Today we shall focus on the building factor — architecture — and how it was.
Architecture in ancient Rome was very representative. It had very monumental buildings to present power. Think of verticality, the use of columns, design to showcase fame and history. The style of construction was mainly compression, arches, vaulted ceilings. Construction itself was spectacular, and the Romans turned it into great buildings.
Best and one of the most notable is the Pantheon. A building that has been standing for almost 2000 years and still maintains its form and function. It is truly one of the most amazing buildings that can be viewed in the world currently. The Pantheon, when looked at, portrays all of its values and functions. Any person that is not an architect can see that — proportions, power, embodiment, meaning, religion, temple. A holy place for the Romans.

I was so happy that we had a creative photoshoot in Rome!
What a big chaos when everyone is preparing! 😀
The stylists are putting makeup on my models, I am managing everyone to make sure we are in the best shape possible and are on time.
This photoshoot I arranged for my Rome models was in Vittoriano, which is a huge neoclassical, monument located right next to Piazza Venezia, in Rome’s city center.
Just to give you an idea of how centrally located Vittariano is:
The Roman Forum is just beside;
The Colosseum is only 5 minutes walk away;
Via del Corso, one of Rome’s main shopping streets is at the other end of Piazza Venezia;
Trajan’s Column is just in front;
Vittoriano is so big and attention-grabbing, it is difficult to miss it if you are walking in the center of the city and it is in stark contrast with anything else in the city. Italians call it ‘the typewriter’ (la macchina da scrivere) and tourists call it “the wedding cake” because of its shape.😊
The staircase is protected by a metal gate (which opens at 9:30 and closes at 19:30 with the last admission at 18.45) and has two fountains at its sides.The one East represents the Adriatic Sea, from where the sun rises, and the one West represents the Tyrrhenian Sea, where the sun sets, symbolizing the natural borders of the Italian peninsula.
At the center of the monument stands the equestrian statue of King Vittorio Emanuele II.During the reign of Victor Emmanuel II, twenty fragmented regions of Italy finally united into one country — the Kingdom of Italy.
The statue is 16 times bigger than a life-size horse and horseman and it hides a secret: the belly of the horse is empty and 24 people had dinner there in 1919! 😊
The monument to the unknown soldier is located in the center of the main staircase, dedicated to the Italians fallen during the I World War.
The changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier takes place every hour and we paused to see the ceremony.I really like men in a uniform and Italian guards in a military uniform in particular. Very yummy looking. 😋 😛
The next level up leads to the colonnade, made of 16 columns in Doric style.The 16 columns represent the 16 regions that formed Italy at the time.Each column is different from the other just to remind the differences and values each region contributed to the Italian identity.On the two sides of the main colonnade, there are the two propylaea.The writing at their top reads ‘Civium Libertati’ (‘Citizens’ Freedom) and ‘Unity of the homeland” (‘Patriae Unitati’).
Climbing farther up, we got to the first set of terraces.
From Terrazza Italia, we could see Trajan’s markets and the Roman Forum, with the Colosseum in the background.From there we took glass elevators and they brought us to the Terrazza delle Quadrighe (chariots pulled by horses, at the very top of the building). From there we saw the whole city!
Going back to my photoshoot, Il Vittoriano is the most distinctive and controversial monument in Rome.
Controversial is exactly how I felt that day for my photoshoot, by placing my provocative beautiful model Dasha right in the middle of it.My goal for the photoshoot was to synergize the female beauty with the beauty of the monument.
My model Dasha did a great job! Don’t you think?

Somebody called her a mother, the majestic one that traps you with her tenderness. Others a lover, the beautiful ones that will always betray and leave you empty.
Do you remember when you felt emptiness for the first time? For me, it was on a blue sky day warmed by a spring sun during a family trip to Rome. I grow up in a small town that looks nothing like an Italian postcard scenario. A place with no visible history that had turned into a breeding ground for an American-inspired landscape of big malls and fast food. Little by little, all the centers in my region started to look the same. Their identities were taken away by the multinational corporation, which opened the same shops in every town. Lucky for me, there was no identity to steal in my town, the shopping centers were just ugliness’ amplification. I thought it was a curse, but in Rome, I understood that it was not. Walking around all that marble beauty, the glorious churches, and the Renaissance paintings, I felt beauty crawling inside me through my eyes. Suddenly, I knew something existed to fill my emptiness.
I had longed for that revelation to become real for years until I sat in front of the Coliseum after a barefoot dancing night to sweet soul music. The lights of dawn were shining on the ancient amphitheater as I heard someone saying words of love to me. I knew it was time to let that childish memory live, so I moved to the Eternal City.
Living in Rome means you must come to terms with your idea of infinity. A crossroads in Ostiense neighbour, a spot not so known by tourists, shows that wells. You stand in the middle, turn around and see a I B.C. century pyramid tomb, a 3rd-century gate, a 1940s train station, a Rationalist building, and the water utility head office, nowadays a symbol of the city’s inefficiency. It’s an architectural timeline that tells of an empire’s rise and fall, horrendous dictatorship, modern revolution. In a few words, the humankind’s eternal struggles to survive. Living in this visible history landscape gives you heavy baggage to carry wherever you go. It makes your life a whisper in time.
It’s no surprise that generations of poets, writers and thinkers have fantasized about an apocalypse for Rome. We secretly love the idea to be the last ones on Earth because it frees us from the duty to build memories of ourselves. Living as a Roman citizen is, in fact, a constant fight to define yourself against the unshakeable memories of the world. It’s up to you to decide if you want to live to destroy or to change. I made the wrong decision at first. I came here to ruin my past, and what I was becoming through the creation of a childhood memory. As some might say, nothing is created or destroyed, but merely transformed, and Rome confirms that. She teaches me how to accept the unshakeable past and evolve. And I ask myself, is the city changing with me?
Every metropolis has an inner dualism, and Rome is no exception. While she is trying to be a more modern tech-city, her past is always calling. Take the Arrotino, for example, the rural artisans who went around town in the XX century to sharpen knives. He is still around here. Every morning you can hear him asking from his car’s speakers if you need to get your gas kitchen or your umbrella fixed. In the air full of Wi-Fi frequencies and electromagnetic waves, his friendly voice is a scream out of time.
Then, the people. Romans gave me the greatest weapon to survive anywhere: self-deprecation. Their dualism is expressed first by their way of nicely making fun of you and, less frequently, of themselves. That is their spirits, shown in lots of songs. Like Tanto Pe Canta’, one of the most famous ones in roman dialect with its melancholically but ironical lyrics about a lying first lover. But irony mixed with their unwavering conviction to still be the world’s emperor can lead to apathy and no respect.
The worldwide narrative on Rome nowadays focuses on the city’s inefficiencies. Yes, Rome has many problems, and that’s why I’m leaving for good in a few weeks. However, I will not go deeper into that for the sake of the city. You must face it: not everything or everyone evolves with you, and I admit it. I go out on my balcony on a summer sunset when the sky turns pink and look at my neighbours. I don’t know their names but I know them so well by their habits. The old patchwork-lady puts a multitexture blanket to her window to hide the living room. She spends hours looking at everybody, but if you look at her, she will quickly turn her face to protect herself too. The frightened smokers, their shutters are down night and day, and they only go outside to smoke cigarettes together with their backs against the wall. The hyperactive worker stays up till late at night, and every time he raises the shutters, his desk is in a different place. On the balcony where once a family talked and laughed together, now there is an empty chair. I ask myself what they see when they look at me. The answer surprised me because I find new habits, an authentic wholeness, and a new person. The child is finally free and it’s all because of you — my beautiful, my betrayer, tender, dirty and amusing Rome. I will love you for eternity, but now it’s time to say goodbye.

With my wife and child, I was on the way to the airport from our small suburb town Shefflield in New Zealand. This was a 60 kilometer drive, with wife and child. We are excited to go our trip to Rome: I was going to attend a conference where I would run a workshop and this trip was also a gift for my daughter for her 11th birthday she would turn in a day, when we would land in Rome.
From our neck of the woods in Sheffield, Rome is about 15,000 kilometers away. We booked our tickets through my university travel agent, and had to go for visa interview with evidence of tickets in hand, a month ahead of the trip. We would fly from Christchurch to Sydney, Australia, and would stay in the aircraft (theoretically still in transition) for about an hour, and then fly from Sydney to Dubai, roughly a fifteen hour flight. We would take the next plane from Dubai for Rome a few hours later, and after another six hours of flight, we would land in Rome. Then we would check into an apartment close to a venue; we chose the apartment hotel because we wanted to have a simple private celebration of our daughter’s birthday when we were there. In Rome, I’d conduct a workshop and participate in a few sessions for an international conference on technology assessment. As we had never visited Rome before, we were excited. This was also a first in ten years, that the three of us (our ten year old daughter, wife, and myself) would fly long distance.
So, off we hopped into our car, and drove towards the airport. Before taking the flight bound for Sydney, we would drop the car at a friend’s house. The drive from our home to the airport/friend’s house is about an hour. Wife was on the wheel, as my cell phone buzzed.
“Hi Dr. Basu, this is Siloxy, your travel agent. Suppose you are on the way to the airport?”“Yes hi Xxxy, we are on the way, will reach in about 20 minutes, so nice of you to call”“Well, er…, actually, you are bound for Sydney, en route to Dubai, right? I just called to say that we have made another arrangement for this flight as you are not taking this flight.”“Wait, what? Why?”“Sorry for this, but while you have an Australian visa, your daughter and wife do not have an Australian visa while in transit. So we had to route your trip through Auckland-Dubai route, so that you will not miss the Dubai-Rome flight”
Why did you not tell me earlier, I wondered. We had booked this ticket months in advance. Why did they not warn us then? Also, it never crossed my mind that any Government authority would ask for transit visa even if we were not to leave the aircraft (as we would not be allowed to). One of the reasons I avoided booking other flights was the hassles and expenses involved in obtaining unnecessary visas. The Indian passports we hold do not allow us visa free entry to any country in the world where we would normally travel.
I hardly had the interest and time to argue these things with the travel agent at that point. I waited as she said before hanging up that she was going to work with the Emirates people to figure out the tickets and seat allocations; we drove along. We waited at the airport for her phone call when she gave us our seat allocations and airline codes that we could get ticekts for the rest of the journey. Instead of a shorter trip by three hours, we had to go a longer route.
I marvel at the speed things get done in our age of information technology. I have a friend who leaves his digital devices at home and disconnects the moment he leaves for his travel. I, on the other hand, like to stay connected on my travel. While we were driving, someone was negotiating with the airlines authorities to arrange and re-route for a famiily of three people to fly all the way 15 thousand kilometres. As we flew rerouted Auckland and Auckland to Dubai and Dubai to Rome, we wondered but for the speed of connectivity and network, if our parents in their age would ever be able to do this. I doubt.
Thirty hours later, we landed at Leonardo Da Vinci Flumicino airport in Rome, took a bus from the airport, and then a metro line, went out of the metro tunnel. Sweating in the thirty seven degree temperature of Rome and winding through narrow footpaths, we finally reach the hotel. The hotel is a nice one, with a lobby in the front and all that. It had a tiny lift that barely fitted two adults and a child and three pieces of luggage. Then we enter the room, thirsty for a cup of coffee or a glass of water at the least. We open the room and go inside.
Nothing.
The room is a bare bones room: a couple of beds, a noisy air condition machine, but for an “apartment hotel”, it did not have glasses, and cups, plates, spoons, coffee/tea sachets, hot water kettle. None of these things. We call the reception: they politely inform us that they would not provide any of these things.
Suprise was the first element in this journey. I take it as a metaphor of life. We think and visualise life in one way, it turns out quite another. Yet we have to adjust no matter what comes our way. This is survival. When the travel agent broke the bad news that our flight had been reconfigured and we were not supposed to take the flightplan we originally thought we would, we were surprised. We were surprised because we expected everything should go as we planned in advance. When we entered the room imagining that it would have cups and plates, and spoons and we could celebrate a private birthday for our daughter as we were going to check into an apartment style hotel, we had assumptions. A lesson in life is that, we need to be flexible to adapt to circumstances and be prepared for twists and turns and surprises in life.
We crashed on the bed, and gave in to sleep after thirty hours of flight across four continents (Oceania: New Zealand, Australia, Asia, Africa, and Europe), and numerous time zones. It was well past wee hours in the morning where we originated on this journey. I went out and got ourselves pieces of sandwich and we downed them with plastic glasses of water. Not the most romantic birthday celebrations, but that was it.
Rome is a city of contrasts — on the one hand you have the grandest Basilica and The Vatican, and on the other hand, not far from Basilica, close to the Piazza Barberini lies the quiet convent of the Capucin Friars (no they didn’t invent the capuccino, although the crema on your capuccino resembles the shape of their hoods which is why you call your coffee capuccino). The monks take the oath of chastity, poverty and humility. A walk in the church reminded me of minimalism and mindfulness in another culture. Marie Condo writes in her “Life changing magic of tidying up”,
Keep only those things that speak to your heart. Then take the plunge and discard all the rest. By doing this, you can reset your life and embark on a new lifestyle.
We came out of the Capucin monastery and walked into the Metro station. It is another matter that if you take to the public transport system of Rome, you can go practically anywhere in Rome and do everything you want to do, that too, at a fraction of the price you will pay for expensive travel alternatives. If you can withstand crowd, rush, heat, inconvenience, and pickpockets, you can travel Rome like a king with pittance.
Speaking of pickpockets. Them too. The source of my second wisdom after surprise: that of mindfulness and minimalism.
So, here we were, came out of the church and walked into the metro station and then it dawned on us that we needed tickets and we forgot to purchase metro tickets from the tobacconists or tabacchis or the small knick-knack shops that sell cigarettes, among other things, for Rome is the last bastion of smokers in this world. We reach out to the ticket machine, and we find posted on the ticket machine a notice that the machine will only accept coins and not currency notes (in Euro). I take out my wallet, fish out the coins, scrounging its interiors, and purchase three tickets. A crowd has already gathered in the train station, the train is approaching. Then a rush to get in, Romans guarding the gate of the metro train. The door of the metro carriage slams shut, and the train takes off. A couple of stations down the tunnel, I feel for my pocket, and realise to my horror — my wallet is gone.
Gone. Like there is nothing there. Shunyata. Nada. Zilch.
I am stranded in a foreign country without my driver’s licence, without money, without credit and debit cards, without anything. My identity is gone, I am no one in the streets of Rome today. A vacuous feeling, a cold sweat ran down me.
I got out of the train, rush to the opposite platform, catch a train going in the other direction, and got off at the Barberini metro station, and ran down to the platform from where I boarded the first train. I asked a couple of people inside an office (that did not sell tickets but answered people’s questions I assume) if anyone has turned in a wallet.
“A what? speak in italiano per favore, we do not understand English here”, said my amio inside the dim lit office.I gesticulated that I lost my wallet and wanted to know if anyone would have turned in. They laughed at the idea. My wallet was stolen and it was gone. I should report to the carabinieri, they suggested.
The friendly carabinieri or the Italian police took an hour and a half to register the fact that my wallet with my driver’s licence, my currency notes, my credit and debit cards, were all stolen. They were sympathetic but they only spoke Italian. They ran the Google Translate to understand what I had to say in half Italian and half English (the smattering of italian I picked up before leaving for Rome on duolingo).
What did I have in my wallet?
What didn’t I?
Stacks of cards and debit/credit cards that I had not used in ages, it was a fat wallet that I cursed now and then. Photos, bits of scrap paper, coins, currency notes, old worn out American dollar bills. But why?
This is my second lesson of the trip: lead a more responsible minimalist mindful life. Get rid of the fluff in everything: speak less, produce more, avoid fluff, be minimalistic. For a wallet, for instance, just-in-time and context is the key. Rather than putting all cards, and scraps in the same wallet, digitize as much as possible. Keep just the bare minimum I need. Why do I need to carry a driver’s licence if I am not going to drive and I already have another identity card with me or another form of identity with me? At every stage, it is important to economise. Do I really need this thing? From Buddha to Leo Babauta, the message about minimising and economising and leading a more minimalistic mindful life is rife in our public domain. As much as I have read about them, I often wonder where do I slip and forget the essential lessons. The wallet was gone. I could not buy stuff I would otherwise crave for when I was on an overseas trip, but did it matter in the end? I could travel a lot freely, never again having to worry about losing my wallet. I could travel light; and most important of all, I realised how little I needed in my day to day life.
Morning of 18th June, I reach the site of my workshop on health technology assessment an hour earlier from the starting time. A couple of technicians hang around.
“Buongiorno Senor, how is it going?” I ask. They say they are hard at work since the wifi is not working in the room. I was surprised, I just turned on my Macbook and it connected pronto. What was the story? They didn’t know. Lo and behold, when I started, there was no connection to the web, and my entire workshop was based on a show and tell and then people to work on their projects. I had to change plans on the fly. Somewhere midway during the workshop, the techies proudly claimed that they solved the problem and gave me a new laptop on which they figured out the Internet connection. We worked along, with shared stories and the workshop was a lot of fun.
This was my third lesson from the trip. You have to be prepared for eventuality that falls on you. Nothing is predictable, nothing can go as planned and we have to be flexible and yet be productive as we move along life. Like the changed flightplan, like the pickpockets in the streets of Rome who left me stranded with nothing on me, and the techies who could not figure out how to connect to the Net when I needed that most.

I walked to the Vatican Museum, the night I landed in Rome. I don’t know why it was my first stop. Given who I am — gay, trans, ex-Catholic, never not mad at the Pope, etc. — I felt a little like Captain Ahab making a visit to the Museum of Whales.
Maybe that was the point. For most of my young life, “the Catholic Church” was a cloud of smoke that I moved through. It was everywhere and nowhere — a set of values, a culture, and not a place. Those values told me that I didn’t exist, or that I was bad for existing. They told me to sit still and accept pain in the name of virtue, to strangle my real self in the cradle so that people would love me.
So it was something, to just stand there, looking at a building — a place, massive brick walls, pitted white statuary above the entrance, abandoned barricades where tourists would have lined up to enter during daytime — and realize that I became myself anyway. To stare Vatican City in the face, and say: Nope. I’m still here. You missed.
There were teenagers making out in front of the barricades. This, too, felt important. Clearly, they didn’t mind that they were on the Pope’s lawn; I don’t think Romans really register the presence of Vatican City, just like I never paused to look up at the Empire…

Campo Di’Fiori is a gorgeous square, full of vendors, flowers, and food stands. I have one of my earliest memories of Rome here with two of my girlfriends, as we sipped espresso and popped into boutiques.
Campo Di’Fiori was also used for public executions.
I hadn’t known the bloody history of this square until I attended a local ghost tour on my last trip to Rome. The center of the square is haunted by Giordano Bruno — a cosmologist who believed the earth moved in a circle around the sun (what a nutcase!)
He was burned at the stake in 1600 during the Roman Inquisition, for the denial of core Catholic doctrines. There is a statue honoring him in the center where his pyre stood.
It’s said in Venice that Giordano returns on the anniversary of his death and appears as pipes bursting, faucets malfunctioning, and flooding — all water related — the one thing that could have saved him from the fire.

Piazza di Spagna and Trinità dei Monei by Paolo Margari, CC
Proximity’s recommendations are crowdsourced from locals and travelers to uncover hidden gems often missed by tourists.
Write to us at hello@ proximityapp.co with your favorite city secret! This was contributed by @SupriaBakht.
Without question, one of the most historic and fascinating cities in the world, Rome is home to some of the best architecture, sights and food. And I wish that was where it stopped.
It’s bizarre! Some of the world’s best pasta, prosciutto and carne right along with some of the most commercial and touristic food on earth.
Which is why the smartest thing a visitor to this hallowed city could do is find a local buddy(shameless plug!). Or follow a local, but at your own caution — I’m not sure what stalking laws in Italy are.
Perhaps if you throw a few chants of “belissima” and “bella” in there, you may even get away with it!
I followed a quintessential Roman couple on their weekend adventures early this summer — not the Italian summer month of August; any Roman worth their cobbled streets would’ve been long gone to the beach by then.
Dinner was at a butcher’s. Of course, this was Rome after all. And the Italians take their food very, very seriously. In fact, the simpler the better.
You can eat like a king without even looking at a restaurant with half a Michelin star.
Filled with locals and featuring an almost purely beef menu, Maxella is an understated butcher by day, Roman dinner gem by night and is right by the Vatican.
With a view as beautiful as this (this may not be the exact view!), I found it perfect for a meal with a group of friends as we wined and feasted our way through some of the best steak I had eaten in a long while.
Dolce, you ask? A hunt for the best Gelato in Rome had the locals firmly split. My most recent favourite after much gluttonous vetting is by far, Gelateria del Teatro — the gesture comes to mind again.
Tucked away in the most elegant corner of Rome, the Gelateria uses all natural ingredients of the finest quality and is a short walk from Piazza Navona.
Of course, a meal fit for bygone Roman emperors must be followed by a digestivo (digestif), which in this case was several large glasses of wine at different bars — all busy and buzzing as we walked through the cobbled streets of Trastevere.
As the night grew late, I wondered when we would wind down. I’d heard Italians weren’t heavy drinkers (nothing like us Indians or the British) and that the bars closed early. To answer my question, I was half walked, half dragged (my many glasses of vino clearly showing their effects!) to Molly Malone in all her Irish themed glory.
A ‘cultural association’, or rather as my friends said (with that hand gesture that was all too comical to me now) Associazione Culturale Molly Malone is an after-hours bar, hidden away in a street of Trastevere, which only locals seem to find, staying open till the early hours of the morning.
The relic of one beautiful loophole in licensing laws is that a cultural association under Roman law is qualified to stay open all night!
Walk in, become a member (a quick one time 2 Euro fee) and say hello to cheap drinks, fun music till very, very early hours of the morning. It’s literally like a piece of Indian bureaucracy smack in the middle of Roman heritage.
During the next evening of wandering the streets of Trastevere, with stops at San Callisto and all the other dingy, Roma jet set bar favourites, my friends decided to dispel all myths about Italian drinking (or lack of as I thought was the case). We trooped down to the river (no jokes) where it turned out all the big night clubs of Rome move for the summer, patio et al. An all night rager ensuing by the Tiber, or rather, Lungotevere (literally, “along the Tiber”) was not what I expected.
The next morning, as I doused myself in espresso and sweet, sweet cornettos (italiano for a croissant) trying to remember the night that was, I realised I had to give them due credit!
Them Italians, they sure can drink. An aperitivo as the day winds down early in the evening, molto vino with dinner, a few drinks at a few bars and then stumbling into a club where vodka ruled the night.
I can safely say, they qualify just as much as the next Indian, Russian, Brit or American.
If you enjoyed my story, please check out what we’re building with Proximity and give the big ol’ white “Recommend” button below a press !

The Roman sun lingered long over the Vatican courtyard.
Hours dissolved into gentle conversation and the quiet hum of folks in Roman piazzas.
In those moments, time felt less like a relentless current and more like a still, sun-warmed pool.
It was a taste of time affluence, a concept as intoxicating as the crisp Italian wine we savored during languid lunches in piazzas where history whispered from every cobblestone.
I recently traveled with my family to Rome and am now considering the concept of time affluence.
Time affluence refers to sufficient time to pursue meaningful activities and leisure, control over one’s schedule, and a lack of time-strapped or overwhelmed.
Back home, the familiar hum of time poverty — that frantic scramble to squeeze more into less — resumes its insistent rhythm.
Yet, something has shifted.

Ok, so that title might be a little more salacious than I meant it. Sorry. I’m not a clickbait kind of a guy, so this is literally about Confession. You know, the Catholic kind. Not “confessions from Las Vegas” or something fun to read like that. But if you’re gonna read-on — thanks!
In 1999 I traveled to spend some time with my younger sister in Italy while she was studying art in Florence.
One morning, my sister having class and various things to do, I decided to take the train to spend the day by myself in Rome.
Before I left my sister in Florence, I told her my plans to see, among other things, the Colosseum and St. Peter’s, but she shook her head. She told me it would be a lot of walking. I’d better take the buses. She tried to explain the public transportation in Rome to me. I don’t think she had much faith in my ability to travel alone in a European city.
I told her I understood and I’d figure it out, but I was intimidated and would pretty certainly be relying on the old heel-toe.
On the hour-long train ride to Rome, I studied my map and my routes and, not wanting to look more like a tourist than I’m sure I already did, I disembarked at Roma Termini with the map in my pocket…

Affirming life in the information age

--
Listen

Visions of of Late Rome keep many of my friends up at night. Today the world is an uncertain place — infrastructure built generations ago is actively tested, information is becoming less reliable and people more superstitious, and many of the bourgeoisie find themselves unable to imagine alternatives to unsustainable forms of life. As an American educated in the Western tradition, it’s natural to wonder: are we headed for collapse comparable to the fall of Rome?
Short answer: no, not in your lifetime, and you probably don’t even know what the fall of Rome looked like.
Longer answer: There are some striking parallels between current and Roman history that I have found worth pondering — in particular, the era of the third and fourth centuries, rather than the fall of Rome in the late fifth century, was an age of ambition much like our own. I found it worthwhile first to understand what the fall probably actually looked like, to dissuade myself from a crass comparison, and then to take a serious look at specific parallel trends between contemporary and Roman times.
First, let’s recall that the image of collapse is a perennial one throughout Western (and specifically American) history. The “Fall of Rome” image is deeply ingrained in the cultural lexicon thanks to a long tradition of Classicism since the Renaissance and punctuated particularly by Edward Gibbon’s 1776 work Decline and Fall, which makes it an unsurprising subconscious visitor. For example, Thomas Cole (work featured above) lived through the uncertain era of Andrew Jackson’s presidency and painted about it. Cole felt pessimistic about the American Project, despaired over the wanton logging of the Catskills, and worried that his own era was coming to resemble Late Rome. (Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. has a splendid book about the age of Jackson that elucidates several of these resemblances.) Hence examining the question, “is the American Project doomed to Roman collapse,” is actually part of a patriotic tradition in which I’m glad to participate.
This in mind, I took a look at the history itself. I am not a classicist, and I have not yet read more than a few chapters of Gibbon, but I did recently peruse the groundbreaking work of the historian Peter Brown. Brown wrote the definitive biography of Saint Augustine and birthed an entire field of history with his The World of Late Antiquity — his work is modern, documentary, and psychological in its approach. I read World as well as his compiled lecture notes from 1978, titled The Making of Late Antiquity, and I also later realized that he had written a chapter in a book I found on the street titled A History of Private Life. Brown is endorsed as a man of the contemporary (at least post-1968) moment as well as an academic trailblazer who is deeply interested in turning vague conceptions into specific answers. In the introduction to World, Brown remarks: “I do not imagine that a reader can be so untouched by the idea of classical Greece and Rome or so indifferent to the influence of Christianity, as not to wish to come to some judgment on the Late Antique world that saw the radical transformation of the one and the victory over classical paganism of the other.” Brown is aware of the power that’s held over us by the fall-of-Rome image, and it’s a delight to read where he takes it to task.
First we ask: what event actually created the image that lives on through Cole? Even in the common understanding of the fall of Rome, the specific date or process is a bit murky. Theodosius died in 395, placing the Roman military in terminal disarray. Rome was sacked a few times throughout the fifth century: by Alaric the Goth in 410, and by the Vandals in 455. The lineage of Western Roman emperors definitively terminated when Odoacer crowned himself in 476. As Brown points out, we should also consider that Odoacer was received rather loyally by the bishops and senate in Italy, and was of course replaced first by the well-loved Theodoric the Great in 493 and by Justinian in 533. By the time that Justinian arrived, bringing an efficient system of taxation that was long forgotten in the West, the landowning aristocrats of Italy — all of whom direct descendants of Romans effectively unmolested by years of Gothic rule — despised him. His war left Italy scorched, and finally in 568 Roman rule of the province permanently ended as it was invaded by Lombards and Saxons. So goes the story that comes to us throug Procopius and Paul the Deacon.
So when was the fall? For Brown, it has to do less with the lineage of Roman rulers and much more with the end of a distinctly Late Antique way of life. (As we saw, Roman subjects could be conquered and ruled without permanent damage to Roman institutions.) This happens, for Brown, squarely under Justinian. However, for me the question is about what psychological salience actually imprinted the powerful image we fixate on. I have no thesis more nuanced than that the “fall” image depicted by Cole must come from the shock and awe of the sacking of Rome. In that sense it’s a fall of a worldview and the beginning of a sense of despair that motivated, for instance, Saint Augustine to write City of God in 426. So perhaps it’s fair to date the “psychological” fall of the empire to the shock of the Visigothic sack in 410. This was a moment whose fallout does directly motivate contemporary reflections. So, in pursuit of comparisons, I looked at Brown’s account of the Gothic War.
Out the gate, Brown has a remarkable take about the Goths: it was xenophobia on the part of the Romans that led to their outright conquest by the numerically inferior Goths. In previous centuries, bands of barbarians were simply allowed to migrate into and settle in Roman territory and become tribute-paying subjects. But, by the fifth century, local authorities refused to allow them. The Goths, presumably pressed from the East by other migrating groups, resorted to violence. Interestingly, local authorities were even more loathe to enlist the help of the Roman military than they were to let the Goths settle and become Romans. The military, as it turns out, had become fundamentally politicized and able to directly appoint emperors, and local authorities basically resented it. Hence, the popular image of barbarian invasion.
Somewhat to their own surprise, the Roman Senate and the young Catholic Church realized that it was much preferable to simply submit to the Goths. There weren’t that many of them, and it was easy enough to let them live cordoned off in their castles as long as they promised to leave Roman institutions alone. This completely freed the Roman elites from any checks by the military, and they found it served their ends quite well. It worked, at least for the short term — Gothic is a dead language, but the Romance languages live on. (As Procopius notes, Theodoric would not even let his children go to school for fear that it would make them less ferocious.) That’s the fall of Rome — local authorities decide that they’d rather be ruled by outsiders than to actually integrate them.
But, as a second slight, the provincial élites explicitly refused to allow the Goths to assimilate to Romanness. They didn’t try to convert them (the Goths were Arians, not trinitarians, and Justinian explicitly uses this religious difference to incite the Franks to invade Italia), they didn’t allow intermarriage, and they didn’t allow Gothic nobles into civil institutions. The result was the collapse of infrastructure, the recession of serious liberal-arts learning into the private libraries of local aristocrats, and the permanent severance of Hispania and Gaul from the Imperial stem. In short, the fall of Rome as an institution in the West was a matter of preferring local and particular institutions to Imperial ones.
And yet, the concept of “Romanness” that motivated the fall lived on for some time, as with the idea of a “universal empire” in the image of Antonine Rome: Charlemagne claimed the crown of the Western Roman emperor in 768, and the notion of universal empire is alive well into the 13th century when Frederick II of Sicily was declared schismatic and likened to the Antichrist. Reductively summarized, a nostalgia for the “pure” Rome caused Western-Rome-as-it-was to go to seed.
(In a way, it reminds me of Lacan’s remark to a hysteric patient: even if your wife were cheating on you, it would be pathological to explode with such anger! One somewhat contrarian conclusion is that, even if immigrants are overrunning your lands and trying to take your resources, it’s pathological to be bigoted toward them. Compare to the Eastern Roman Empire, where Slavic settlement was handled rather gracefully and where new arrivals into the Mediterranean Basin were effectively managed well into the tenth century.)
In any case, this is the picture of the “Fall of Rome” that I glean from Brown: limited to Western Roman provinces and largely the result of internal institutional discontent and the selfish motives of local authorities. The provinces seem to have fallen like Nietzsche’s apples from the tree, off to become (as he writes in The Gay Science) “pioneers of spiritual colonization, and of a new construction of national and social unions.” From new Frankish and Saxon worlds, Western Europe as we know it was born. The remaining Roman Empire, constituting a more urban set of provinces better protected from military antagonism, proceeded onward for a couple of quite successful centuries.
So, to answer the question in the premise of the article: no, we’re not living in a time comparable to the fall of Western Rome. There is absolutely no comparison between the political functions of the Roman and the contemporary American militaries. The Founding Fathers had Caesar’s excesses explicitly in mind and centuries later we have not wavered on the role of our commanders. We don’t have local governments eager to submit outright to foreign invaders. We don’t see migrants goaded into attacking the United States, and in contrast we see them quickly and eagerly assimilated upon arrival. Certainly the visa process is Byzantine and many of our institutions are blatantly exclusionary, but in fact less so than ever. It’s the age of Bobos in Paradise. As much as we might like to trot out Cole’s painting as we fear the end of democracy or the collapse of the health care system, I now keep in mind the intepretation that Rome’s infrastructure collapse was effectively voluntary.
But we have to back up. How did the Western Empire get to a place where the military was clashing with the Senate and the Church? How did the local élite arrive from the world of Julius Caesar to the world of Gregory of Tours? It’s in the transitional centuries — the third and fourth, culminating in the meteoric rise of Christianity—where Brown reveals the most striking parallel.
As Harold Bloom wrote, we study history to deliver ourselves from the hysteria of the news of the day and to condition ourselves into a calmer pessimism. To remind ourselves, as implored by the Book of Ecclesiastes, that there is nothing new under the sun. After a few years in Silicon Valley, this idea really sits with me — for a certain class of people, the past has become a kind of resource (an “evidentiary grab bag”) that gets mined for data or for political quips or for salient images such as Cole’s collapse to dress up a marketing pitch. In spite of the somewhat-recent craze about Peter Turchin and his bark beetles, you’d think we wouldn’t go acting like history is some kind of empirical science. But, in what I think is a real parallel to Roman history, we live in an era that is so competitive that we cannot help but try to plunder history for shallow rhetorical benefit.
For Brown, the third century marks the rise of a comparable era of ambition. He attributes it to a number of causes: a roving Marian military that offered social mobility to anyone willing to serve, the opening of far-ranging trade routes, the availability of roads for élites to travel and interchange themselves between Imperial cities and the accompanying sense of envy and increase in the pace of life. In any case, the radical change is very simply the following: in the age of the Antonines, local élites were held accountable to their cities, required to sponsor rituals and allowed to display their wealth primarily through public monuments; by the reign of Constantine, this money was spent on lavish private mansions and on sending one’s children to expensive philosophical academies and later to Rome or Constantinople. There they would saturate themselves in rhetoric, which would be used to curry favor in public life. (For example, see Augustine’s profuse references to Virgil in City of God. It was commonplace for aspiring Roman élites to make reference to Troy or to the early days of Rome.) Indeed, the word ambition refers to Roman senators walking through the streets petitioning!
Accompanying the shift from municipal public life to the political theater of the capital, says Brown, was the shift from the belief in supernatural powers in the form of ritual to the belief in supernatural powers in the form of the powerful individual. Holy men roamed the land, and for this reason Jesus was painstakingly described as not simply another sorcerer. Every Christian saint for the first three centuries after Christ claimed fame by performing great feats, mostly of healing, and was also painstakingly contrasted with the common sorcerer. In sum, power retreats from the polis to the man. And, of course, corruption flourished. In Nietzsche’s words: “corruption” is just a vulgar phrase for “the autumntide of a people.”
Indeed, for Brown, the rise in corruption and the abdication of local civic posts by ambitious pagans opened up opportunities for others. It was among the Roman military — an empire-wide meritocratic institution that eventually came to be able to outright select the emperor — that Christianity began to flourish. Christianity, genealogically, has been the religion of rootlessness and of meritocracy. “Love thy neighbor,” Brown points out, is an injunction that best makes sense to someone who is intent on moving up and choosing his neighbors. And it was in cities like Alexandria that the Christians began to take over public services from the ersatz pagan local aristocracy. In this sense, we’re reminded, the Roman Catholic Church is very directly the continuation of the civic structure of the Roman Empire. Christianization occurred in the cracks opened by ambition, but also encouraged and universalized it.
Finally, the transition to Late Rome was accomplished by the emergence of the Christian strivers as a class unto itself. Themselves halfway-educated — not all of them were like Augustine, put through the exorbitant Classical education of a Carthaginian schoolhouse before shipping off to Milan — and concerned primarily with running hospitals and abbeys and parishes and common schools, the Christians began to make their bourgeois life into a hereditary deal. To be born into a middle-class Christian household meant effective separation from both the life of the working man and the life of the pagan élite. This class would grow relatively wealthy on its accomplishments, having enmeshed itself into the Roman social fabric, would go on to hold many ecumenical disputes, and would eventually lose most interest in Christianizing anyone who was not a Roman. (Although a few brave souls would go north to the British Isles or east to Mesopotamia and India to proselytize.) With the success of Christianity, ironically, would come the creation of a rather xenophobic civic pride.
The parallel to today’s situation is more clear: certainly one can look at the decline of public institutions in favor of private ambition and think “yep, today we have the track through the Ivy League to San Francisco and New York City — no one’s going back home to Cleveland.” We can see how, if the “Great Awokening” is an apt term, at least one strain of our recent political shift toward explicit identity politics is doing something similar to what the early Christians accomplished. At once, we are trying to reach at least some of the more excluded members of society by transforming public services enough to annoy the Wall Street Journal and also (as far as I can tell) preaching pretty unmodified neoliberalism to them. Increasing competition for tertiary education, much of which offered by institutions that require little to no Classical learning, promises to make membership in this upper middle class increasingly hereditary. And, moreover, the fragmentary familiarity with philosophy and literature to which our strivers cling seems to perfectly mirror the education that Brown describes early Christians receiving.
As I remarked in a previous article, I have come to believe our scientific civilization is at a sort of autocannibalistic moment. Our social structures — universities, corporate jobs, dating apps — are subjected to scientific scrutiny and the often self-loathing desire by ambitious professionals to “optimize” outcomes. Our habit of grabbing from the evidentiary bag stems, in my estimation, from a glut of highly-trained people frantic for new domains unto which to apply the methods of science. (For instance, to use a crass historical comparison, after the fall of the Soviet Union the influx of math PhDs to the United States produced disastrous uneployment rates.) The training produces an expectation of a certain payout, hence, lots of competition. Many of these math PhDs famously turned to Black-Scholes-powered options trading instead of research. Here I think Peter Turchin does have a point: the age of ambition is the age of the overproduction of élites.
Thus, to flesh out the second answer in the article’s premise: If anything, today’s world resembles the third or fourth century, where ambitious people weaponize rhetoric — such as quick comparison to the past, or sophistries such as giving a geometry to the world of ideas — to clamber over each other in pursuit of élite appointments.
An example: once, in the low-interest-rate before-times, I found myself hanging out with a group of day-drunk Stanford PhD students and Google employees discussing the history of economic growth. One of them was puzzling over a certain graph of global GDP since 1700. It basically showed a steady state perturbed by two bumps: one at the discovery of internal combustion; and the other at the invention of the semiconductor. Perhaps compelling evidence that digital attention would replace fossil fuels as the defining technology of the next century, but it was terrifying him that there’s no way to put it into a model that would predict the next bump. Another student was trying to explain why there’s a colossal amount of venture capital sitting around — the answer was that we had reached the edge of the space of ideas. He had constructed a model of “possible technological ideas.”
They’re all nice folks, but I won’t mince words: trying to take “technological ideas” and cram it into a mathematical space speaks at the very least to quite a lot of pressure to publish work according to a certain formula. (I also found it interesting that this study of the history of economic growth didn’t really seem to be concerned with the effects of chattel slavery.) Not that I think that research on the history and future of technology is rooted in bad intuition, but surely the use of historical GDP as a single measurement or the mathematical formulation of a “space of ideas” are publish-or-perish hammers in search of nails. Surely you’d only be writing these papers because you’re scrambling in the academic competition.
Yes, if you look into the past, you will find what you are looking for. Certainly my own reading of Brown is colored by a highly selective lens: obviously the chronology of the Christianization of Rome is more specific, filled with highly contingent events and all sorts of other processes that I have neglected to highlight. But the goal here, as with all history, is to contemplate and to free ourselves from the despair that accompanies naive formulaic thinking.
Hopefully, this should all serve to underscore the primary point: today does a bit like a certain part of Roman history, centuries prior to the fall of the Western Empire, but we must take seriously that this is only a resemblance for our contemplation.

We were in Rome this past December. We were surprised by the amount of people then, and I even commented that I can’t imagine how crazy the city is at peak season. But the winter is certainly the time to be there. Just a 20 minute wait to get in the Sistine Chapel and only a few people standing around the Trevi fountain (though it was under renovation and not the easiest to get a good look at). We didn’t have time for the coliseum, sadly, but saw it at night and it was spectacular all lit up. I would go back, but would stick to the quieter times, for sure.

I write this while munching on a juicy tomato. It’s surprising how different produce tastes depending on where you are.
Last time I was in Rome, I was on an exchange program organized by Wellesley college, an all women’s college in the suburbs of Boston. Without thinking, I am retracing the same path. I stumbled upon the same bar just beside a lookout and restaurant I first dined solo in Trastevere.
I’m impressed- blown away – by the beauty of Rome. It’s a living, breathing museum with man-made structures, lookouts that layer old and new, sunset colours dazzling throughout. At times, the touristic hoards tire me, we swerve through seas of tired and worn out people, all sweating in harmony.
It can be hard to enjoy the sites since there are so many tourists everywhere each side of the vision is filled, serving as a distraction. Unfortunately, as a tourist myself I contribute to the crowds. Rome is most beautiful after the sun has set – in the framed vistas unobscured by a wandering camera laden tourist.
At first it’s hard to like Rome. The brutish affect of the locals can dishearten my weak people pleaser disposition. But, when you dig beneath the surface, there is an authenticity to the hospitality. Heck, we had a waiter drive us home when we asked if the restaurant could call us a cab, explaining after that we were too far outside the city for it to fiscally worth it.
Passing through Milan, and it’s organization, I pegged myself a northern Italian girly. Yet, I find myself yearning for Rome. The easy way you can stroll without purpose (or fare un passeggiata) and stumble upon a fountain, tall green trees that are top heavy, and coupolas. In DC, I would have to intentionally walk to the parts of Kalorama that reminded me of Rome, the miniature Spanish steps, ornate embassies, and city parks.
When I’m wandering through Rome alone, I wonder if this is the happiest way I travel, without itinerary – solitary, my thoughts are mine alone. After a mandatory carbonara followed by a sweet cake, I make my way to the action. The piazza is buzzing. Small groups sip on beers, the conversation carrying over from dinner into the night. It appears little planning is required for these social gatherings. Folks stroll aimlessly.
In a pilgrimage, I find the Tiber river and peak down to the night market that hugs the side of the river. I wander up a bridge for a better look. As I move away from Trastevere the sound fades, and my fatigue hits. The taxi driver plays Andrea Boccelli and with the backdrop of Rome passing by my window, I basque in a quintessential Roman moment.

There is a thing to be said about visiting a city repeatedly. On the first, and maybe the second visit, you tick all the boxes: you visit all the sights and explore all the features that the city has to offer. When in Rome: you visit the Colosseum, Forum Romanum, Vatican, Villa Borghese and the countless other museums and palazzos and not to forget the churches, the innumerable churches; you wine and dine in Trastevere and you hang out by the Spanish Steps.
Then you go back for more visits, and you find yourself with time on your hands. So you walk about different neighbourhoods, you get lost here and there and end up in new places which no guidebook has pointed you towards. That’s when you really discover a city.
Rome features glorious colours, and especially during the golden hour, you can find yourself wandering around in a CinemaScope movie (and worth a photo set of its own). But Rome is also black and white, shadows and shades of grey, and because this reflects more, for me, my “own private Rome”, here is is a set of black and white photos which I took during my last trip there this September. I love Rome, and each time I visit the city, I find new places and new reasons to love it; and this is my love letter to the Città Eterna.

A few months ago you may have witnessed my preparation for Rome.
As a long-ago flight attendant I’ve landed in Italy, I’ve had layovers, I’ve never stayed. So I consider this a first time.
medium.com
I know now — I was ineffectively looking to shortcut the learning process.
This is the drill:
Right?
We reflect— is there more to see? Do I want to know more?
Yet this formula is flawed. There are aspects of travel to consider, which means every trip is different— who, if anyone, are you with? What’s the season? Have you been here before? Do you speak the language?

You might too if it looked like this. The Tiber, or Tevere in Italian, is the unsavory khaki color of the urine of a person with advanced liver failure. It rises on Mount Fumaiolo and drags the Apennines’ silt and mud across Italy on its way to the city.
Under the Italian sun, even the dirtiest things can be made to shine, but Rome’s river is more or less neglected. Without it, the empire would never gotten off the ground, but nowadays, there are better ways to feed a city.
Still, what makes Rome the marvel that it is is not its well-known landmarks, but its secrets. It’s the gloomy crypts and hidden passages and half-forgotten masterpieces that keep people like me coming to the city again and again. Besides, my favorite gelato shop is right beside the river.
But this isn’t really about Rome. It isn’t even really about the river. It’s about the way the words and photos of a stranger online can give our memories back to us. It’s about the way that one day, many years and thousands of kilometers away from another, can nevertheless start to take on the shape…
